The caves of steel By ISAAC ASIMOV 


BALEY remained standing, 
in a tetany of shock, as 
Jessie ran to him, seized 
his shoulders, huddled close. 



His pale lips formed the word, 
"Bentley?" 

She looked at him and shook 
her head. "He's all right." 

"Well, then?" 

Jessie said through a sudden 
torrent of sobs, in a low voice 
that could scarcely be made out, 
"I can't go on, Lije. I can't sleep 
or eat. I've got to tell you!" 

"Don't say anything," Baley 
said in anguish. "For God's sake, 
Jessie, not now!" 

"I must. I've done a terrible 
thing — " 

Baley said hopelessly, "We're 
not alone, Jessie." 

She looked up and stared at 
R. Daneel with no sign of recognition. The tears in which her 
eyes were swimming were evidently refracting the robot into 
a featureless blur. 

R. Daneel said, "Good afternoon, Jessie." 

She gasped. "Is it the — the 
robot?" She dashed the back of 
her hand across her eyes and 
stepped out of Baley's encircling 
right arm. She breathed deeply 
and, for a moment, a tremulous 
smile wavered on her lips. "It is 
you, isn't it?" 

"Yes, Jessie." 

"You don't mind being called 
a robot. " 

"No, Jessie. That is what I 

am." 

"And I don't mind being called 
a fool and an idiot and a — a sub

versive agent, because that's what 
/ am." 

"Jessie!*' groaned Baley. 

"It's no use, Lije," she said. 
"He might as well know — he's 
your partner. I don't care if I go 
to jail. I don't care if they send 
me down to the lowest levels and 
make me live on raw yeast and 
water. I don't care if — You wop't 
let them, will you, Lije? Don't 
let them do anything to me! I'm 
frightened!" 

Baley patted her shoulder and 
let her cry. He said to R. Daneel. 
"She isn't well. We can't keep 
her here. What time is it?" 

R. Daneel replied without visibly consulting a timepiece, 
"Fourteen-forty-five." 

"The Commissioner may be 
back any minute. We'd better 
commandeer a squad-car. We can 
talk this over in the Motorway." 

Jessie's head jerked upright. 
"The Motorway? Oh, no, Lije." 

He said, in as soothing a tone 
as he could manage, "Now, Jessie, 
don't be superstitious. You can't 
go on the Expressway the way 
you are. Be a good girl and calm 
down or we won't even be able 
to go through the office." 

CHE wiped her face with a 
^ damp handkerchief and said 
drearily, "Oh, look at my makeup." 

"Don't worry about your 
makeup," said Baley. "Daneel, 



what about the squad-car?" 

"It's waiting for us now, partner Elijah." 

"Come on, Jessie." 

"Wait — just a minute, Lije. 
I've got to do something to my 
face." 

"It doesn't matter now." 

But she twisted away. "Please! 
I can't go through the Common 
Room like this. I won't take a 
second." 

The man and the robot waited 
— the man impatiently, the robot 
impassively. 

Jessie rummaged through her 
purse for the necessary equipment. If there was one thing, 
Baley thought resignedly, that 
had resisted mechanical improvement since Medieval times, it 
was a woman's purse. Even the 
substitution of magnetic clotures 
for metal clasps had not proven 
successful. Jessie pulled out a 
small mirror and the silver-cased cosmeto-kit that Baley had 
bought her three birthdays before. 

The cosmeto-kit had several 
orifices and she used each in turn. 
All but the last spray were invisible. She used them with that 
fineness of touch and delicacy 
of control that seems to be the 
birthright of women from Sumerian to Galactic eras. 

The base went on first, in a 
smooth, even layer that removed 
all shininess and roughness from

the skin and gave it the light 
golden glow which long experience had taught Jessie was the 
shade best suited to the natural 
coloring of her hair and eyes. 
Then a touch of tan along the 
forehead and chin — a gentle 
brush of color on either cheek, 
tracing back to the angle of the 
jaw — a delicate drift of blue on 
the upper eyelids and along the 
earlobes F nally came the application of smooth carmine to the 
lips This involved the one visible spray, a delicate pink mist 
that glistened liquidly in air, but 
dried and deepened richly on contact with the lips. 

"There," said Jessie, with several swift pats at her hair and a 
look of deep dissatisfaction. "I 
suppose that will have to do." 

The process had taken more 
than the promised second, but 
less than fifteen. Nevertheless, it 
had seemed interminable to 
Baley. 

"Come on," he said. 

She barely had time to return 
the cosmeto-kit to the purse before he pushed her through the 
door. 

T^HE eerie silence of the Motorway lay thick on either side. 
Baley said, "AH right, Jessie. 
What did you do?" 

The impassivity that had 
masked Jessie's face since they 
left the Commissioner's office 



showed signs of cracking. She 
looked at her husband, then at 
Daneel in helpless silence. 

Baley said, "Get it over with, 
Jessie — please! Have you committed an actual crime?" 

"A crime?" She shook her head 
uncertainly. 

"No hysterics. Just say yes or 
no, Jessie. Have you — " he hesitated briefly — "killed anyone?" 

The look on Jessie's face was 
promptly changed to indignation. 
"Why, Lije Baley!" 
"Yes or no, Jessie." 
"No — of course not." 
The hard knot in Baley's 
stomach softened perceptibly. 
"Have you stolen anything? Falsified ration data? Assaulted anyone? Destroyed property? Speak 
up, Jessie." 

"I didn't mean anything like 
that." She looked over her shoulder. "Lije, do we have to stay 
down here?" 

"Until this is over.. Now start 
at the beginning. What did you 
come to tell us?" 

Jessie spoke in a soft voice. 
"It's these people, these Medievalists. You know, Lije — they're 
always around, always talking. 
Even in the old days, when I was 
an assistant dietician, it was 
like that. Remember Elizabeth 
Thornbowe?, She was a Medievalist. She was always talking 
about how all our troubles came 
from the City and how things 



THE CAVES OF 5TEEL 



113 



were better before the Cities 
started. 

"I used to asg her how she 
was so sure, especially after you 
and I met. Lije — remember the 
talks we used to have? — and 
then she'd quote Trom those small 
book-reels that are always floating around. You know, like 
Shame of the Cities that the fellow wrote. I don't remember his 
name." 

Baley said absently, "Ogrinsky 
and Lincoln Steffms. Centuries 
ago." 

"Yes, only most of the bookreels were lots worse. Then, when 
I married you, she was really 
sarcastic. She said, 'I suppose 
you're going to be a real City 
woman, now that you've married 
a policeman.' After that, she 
didn't talk to rne much and then 
I quit the job and that was that. 
Lots of things she used to say 
were just to shock me, I think, or 
to make herself look mysterious 
and glamorous. 

"She was an old maid, you 
know — never got married till the 
day she died. Lots of those Medievalists don't fit in, one way or 
another. Remember you once 
said, Lije, that people sometimes 
mistake their own shortcomings 
for those of society and want to 
fix the Cities because they don't 
know how to fix themselves." 

Baley remembered and his 
words now sounded flip and su


perficial in his own ears. He said 
gently, "Keep to the point, 
Jessie." 

SHE went on, "Anyway, Lizzy 
was always talking about how 
there'd come a day and people 
had to get together. She said it 
was all the fault of the Spacers 
because they wanted to keep 
Earth weak and decadent. That 
was one of her favorite words, 
'decadent.' She'd look at the 
menus I'd prepare for the next 
week and sniff and say, 'Decadent — decadent.' Jane Myers 
used to imitate her in the cookroom and we'd die laughing. 

"She said, Elizabeth did, that 
someday we were going to break 
up the Cities and go back to the 
soil and have an accounting with 
the Spacers, who were trying to 
tie us forever to the Cities by 
forcing robots on us. Only she 
never called them robots. She 
used to say 'soulless monster-machines' — if you'll excuse the expression, Daneel." 

The robot said, "I am not 
aware of the significance of the 
adjective used. Jessie, but in any 
case I am not offended. Please 
go on." 

Baley stirred restlessly. It was 
that way with Jessie. No emergency, no crisis, could make her 
tell a story in any but her own 
circuitous way. 

She said, "Elizabeth always 




 



tried to talk as though there were 
lots of people in it with her. She'd 
say, 'At the last meeting,' and 
then stop and look at me, sort of 
half -proud and half -scared, as 
though she wanted me to ask 
about it so she could look important, yet scared I might get 
her in trouble. Of course, I never 
asked her. I wouldn't give her 
the satisfaction. Anyway, after I 
married you, Lije, it was all over 
until . . ." 
She stopped. 

"Go on, Jessie," said Baley. 

"You remember that argument 
we had? About Jezebel, I mean?" 

It took a second or two for 
Baley to recall that was Jessie's 
own name and not a reference 
to another woman. 

He turned to R. Daneel in an 
automatically defensive explanation. "Jessie's full name is Jezebel. She is not fond of it and 
doesn't use it." 

R. Daneel nodded gravely and 
Baley thought: Jehosophat, why 
waste an explanation on him? 

"It bothered me a lot, Lije," 
Jessie said. "It really did. I guess 
it was silly, but I kept thinking 
and thinking about what you 
said. I mean about your saying 
that Jezebel was only a conservative who fought for the customs of her ancestors against 
the strange ones the newcomers 
had brought. After all, / was 
Jezebel and I always. . ." 



She groped for a word and 
Baley supplied it. "Identified 
yourself?" 

JESSIE shook her head and 
looked away. "Not really, of 
course — not literally — not the 
way I thought she was. I wasn't 
like that." 

"I know, Jessie. Don't be foolish." 

"But still I thought of her a lot 
and somehow I got to thinking 
that it's just the same now as it 
was then. I mean we Earth people had our old ways and here 
were the Spacers coming in with 
a lot of new ways and trying to 
encourage the new ways we had 
stumbled into ourselves, and 
maybe the Medievalists were 
right. Maybe we should go back 
to our good old ways. So I went 
and found Elizabeth." 

"Yes. Go on." 

"She said she didn't know what 
I was talking about, and besides 
I was a cop's wife. I said that had 
nothing to do with it and finally 
she said, well, she'd speak to 
somebody and then, about a 
month later, she came to me and 
said it was all right and I joined 
and I've been going to meetings 
ever since." 

Baley looked at her sadly. 
"And you never told me?" 

Jessie's voice trembled. "I'm 
sorry, Lije." 

"Well, that won't help — being 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



115 



sorry, I mean. I want to know 
about the meetings. In the first 
place, where were these klatsches 
held?" 

A sense of detachment was 
creeping over him, a numbing of 
emotions. What he had tried not 
to believe Vas so, unmistakably 
so. In a sense, it was a relief to 
know the truth, to have the uncertainty over. 

She said, "Down here." 

"Down here? You mean on this 
spot?" 

"Right in the Motorway. 
That's why I didn't want to come 
down here. It was a wonderful 
place to meet, though. We'd get 
together — " 

"How many?" 

"I'm not sure. Maybe sixty or 
seventy. It was just a sort of 
local branch- There'd be folding 
chairs and some refreshments and 
someone would make a speech. 
They were mostly about how 
wonderful life was in the old days 
and how someday we'd do away 
with the inonsters — the robots, 
that is — and the Spacers, too. 
The speeches were sort of dull, 
really, because they were all the 
same. We just endured them. 
Mostly it vas the fun of getting 
together arid feeling important. 
We would pledge ourselves to 
oaths and there'd be secret ways 
we could greet each other on the 
outside." 

"Weren't you ever interrupted? 



No squad-cars or fire-engines 

passed?" 

"No — never." 

T> DANEEL interrupted, "Is 
that unusual, Elijah?" 

"Maybe not," Baley answered 
thoughtfully. "There are some 
side-passages that are practically 
never used. It's quite a trick, 
knowing which they are, though. 
Is that all you did at the meetings, Jessie — make speeches and 
play at conspiracy?" 

"It's about all. We'd sing songs, 
sometimes. And, of course, we 
had refreshments. Nothing fancy 
— just sandwiches and juice." 

"In that case," he said almost 
brutally, "what's bothering you?" 

Jessie winced. "You're angry." 

"Please!" said Baley, with iron 
patience. "Answer my question. 
If it's as harmless as that, why 
have you been in such a panic 
for the last day and a half?" 

"I thought they would hurt 
you, Lije. For heaven's sake, why 
do you act as though you don't 
understand? I've explained it to 
you." 

"No, you haven't — not yet. 
You've told me about a harmless 
little kaffee-klatsch you belonged 
to. Did they ever hold open demonstrations? Did they ever destroy robots — start riots — kill 
people?" 

"Never! Lije, I wouldn't do any 
of those things. I wouldn't stay 



116 




 



a member if they tried it." 

"Well, then, why do you say 
youVe done a terrible thing? Why 
do you expect to be sent to jail?" 

"They used to talk about someday when they'd put pressure on 
the government. We were supposed to get organized and then 
afterward there would be strikes 
and work stoppages. We could 
force the government to ban all 
robots and make the Spacers go 
back where they came from. I 
thought it was just talk and then 
this thing started — -about you and 
Daneel, I mean. 

"Then they said, 'Now we'll see 
action,' and, 'We're going to make 
an example of them and put a 
stop to the robot invasion right 
now.' Right there in Personal, 
they said it, not knowing it was 
you they were talking about. But 
/ knew — right away." 

Her voice broke. 

Baley softened. "Come on, 
Jessie. It was just talk. You can 
see for yourself that nothing has 
happened." 

"I was so — so scared. And I 
thought, I'm part of it. If there 
was going to be killing and destruction, you might be killed, 
and Bentley, and somehow it 
would be all — my fault for taking 
part in it, and I ought to be sent 
to jail." 

Baley let her sob herself out. 
He put his arm about her shoulder and stared tight-lipped at R. 



Daneel, who gazed calmly back. 

He said, "Who was the head 
of your group?" 

^HE was quieter now, patting 
^ the corners of her eyes with a 
handkerchief. "A man called Joseph Klemin was the leader, but 
he wasn't really anybody. He 
wasn't more than five feet four 
inches tall and I think he was 
terribly henpecked at home. I 
don't think there's any harm in 
him. You aren't going to arrest 
him, are you, Lije — not on my 
say-so?" She looked guiltily troubled. 

"I'm not arresting anyone just 
yet. How did Klemin get his 
instructions?" 

"I don't know." 

"Did any strangers come to 
the meetings? You know what I 
mean — big shots from Central 
Headquarters?" 

"Sometimes people would come 
to make speeches. That wasn't 
very often — maybe twice a year 
or so." 

"Can you name them?" 

"No. They were always just 
introduced as 'one of us* or 'a 
friend from Jackson Heights' or 
wherever." 

"I see. Daneel!" 

"Yes, Elijah." 

"Describe the men you think 
you've tabbed. We'll see if Jessie 
can recognize them." 

R, Daneel went through the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



117 



list with clinical exactness. Jessie 
listened with an expression of 
dismay. As the categories of 
physical measurements lengthened, she shook her head with increasing firmness. 

"It's no use, no use at all," she 
cried. "How can I remember how 
any of them looked? I can't . . ." 
She stopped and seemed to consider. "Did you say one of them 
was a yeast farmer?" 

"Francis Clousarr," said R. 
Daneel, "is an employee at New 
York Yeast." 

"Well, once a man was making a speech and I happened to 
be sitting in the first row and I 
kept getting a whiff — just a whiff 
really — of raw yeast. You know 
what I mean, The only reason I 
remember is that I had an upset 
stomach that day and the smell 
kept making me sick. I had to 
stand up and move to the back 
and of course I couldn't explain 
what was wrong. It was so embarrassing. Maybe that's the man 
you're speaking of. After all, 
when you work with yeast all 
the time, the odor gets to stick 
to your clothes." 

"You don't remember what he 
looked like?" asked Baley. 

"No," she replied with decision. 

"All right, then. Look, Jessie, 
I'm going to take you to your 
mother's. Bentley will stay with 
you and none of you will leave 
the Section. Ben can stay home 



from school and I'll arrange to 
have meals sent in and the corriridors around the apartment 
watched by the police." 

"What about you?" quavered 
Jessie. . 

"I'll be in no danger." 

"But how long will we have to 
stay?" 

"I don't know. Maybe just a 
day or two." The words sounded 
hollow "even to himself. 

HpHEY were back in the Motor -■- way, Baley and R. Daneel — 
alone now. Baley's expression was 
dark. 

"It looks to me," he said, "as 
if we're up against an organization built up on two levels. First, 
a ground level with no specific 
program, designed only to supply 
mass support for an eventual 
coup. Secondly, a much smaller 
elite dedicated to a well -planned 
program of action. It is this elite 
we must find. The comic-opera 
groups Jessie spoke of can be 
ignored." 

"All this," said R. Daneel, "follows if we can take Jessie's story 
at face value." 

"I think we can," Baley said 
stiffly. 

"So it would/'' seem," said R. 
Daneel. "There is nothing about 
her cerebro-impulses that would 
indicate a pathological addiction 
to lying." 

Baley turned an offended look 



118 




 



upon the robot. "I should say 
not! And there will be no necessity to mention her name in our 
reports. Do you understand 
that?" 

"If you wish it so, partner 
Elijah," said R. Daneel calmly, 
"but our report will then be 
neither complete nor accurate." 

Baley said, "Maybe not K but 
no real harm will be done. She 
came to us with whatever information she had and mentioning her name will only put her 
in the police records. I don't want 
that to happen." 

"In that case, certainly not — 
provided we are certain nothing 
more remains to be found- out." 

"Nothing as far as she's concerned. My guarantee." 

"Could you then explain why 
the word Jezebel, the mere sound 
of a name, should lead her to 
abandon previous convictions and 
assume a new set? The motivation seems obscure." 

They were traveling- slowly 
through the curving empty tunnel. 

Baley said. "Jezebel is a rare 
name. It once belonged to a woman of very bad reputation. My 
wife treasured that fact. It gave 
her a vicarious feeling of wickedness and compensated for a completely proper life." 

"Why should a law-abiding 
woman wish to feel wicked?" 

Baley almost smiled. "Because 



she is law-abiding. Anyway, I did 
a very foolish thing. In a moment 
of irritation, I insisted that the 
historic Jezebel was in reality a 
good wife. I've regretted explaining that ever since. It made Jessie 
bitterly unhappy. I had spoiled 
something for her that couldn't 
be replaced. I imagine she wished 
to punish me by engaging in 
activity she knew I wouldn't approve of. I would say the wish 
was not a conscious one." 

"Can a wish be anything but 
conscious? Is that not a contradiction in terms?" 

T> ALEY stared at R. Daneel 
and despaired at attempting 
to explain the unconscious mind. 
He said instead, "Besides that, 
the Bible has a great influence 
on human thought and emotion." 

"What is the Bible?" 

For a moment Baley was surprised, and then was surprised at 
himself for being surprised. The 
Spacers, he knew, lived under a 
thoroughly mechanistic personal 
philosophy. R. Daneel could 
know only what the Spacers 
knew and no more. 

He said curtly, "It is the sacred 
book of about half of Earth's 
population." 

"I db not grasp the meaning 
of the adjective." 

"I mean that it is highly regarded. Various portions of it, 
when properly interpreted, con


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



119 



tain a code, of behavior which 
many, men consider best suited to 
the ultimate happiness of mankind." 

R. Daneel seemed to consider 
that. "Is this code incorporated 
into your laws?" 

"I'm afraid not. The code 
doesn't lend itself to legal enforcement. It must be obeyed by 
each individual out of a desire 
to do so. It is, in a sense, higher 
than any law can be." 

"Higher than law? Nothing can 
be!" 

Baley smiled wryly. "Shall I 
quote a portion of the Bible for 
you?" 

"Please do." 

Baley let the car slow to a halt 
and for a few moments sat with 
his eyes closed, remembering. He 
would have liked to use the 
sonorous Middle English of the 
Medieval Bible — but, to R. 
Daneel, Middle English would 
be gibberish. 

He began, speaking almost casually, in the words of the Modern 
Revision, as though he were telling a story of contemporary life 
instead of dredging a tale out of 
Man's remote past. 

" 'Jesus went to the mount of 
Olives, and at dawn returned to 
the temple. All the people came 
to Him, and He sat down and 
preached to them. And the 
scribes and Pharisees brought to 
Him a woman caught in adultery, 



and when they had placed her 
before Him, they said to Him, 
"Master, this woman was caught 
in adultery, in the very act. Now 
Moses, in the law, commanded 
us to stone such offenders. What 
do you say?" 

" 'They said this, hoping to 
trap Him, that they might have 
grounds for accusations against 
Him. But Jesus stooped down, 
and with His finger wrote on the 
ground, as though He had not 
heard them. But when they continued asking Him, He stood up 
and said to them, "He that is 
without sin among you, let him 
first cast a stone at her." 

" 'And again He stooped down 
and wrote on the ground. And 
those that heard this, being convicted by their own conscience, 
went away one by one, beginning 
with the oldest, down to the last : 
and Jesus was left alone, with 
the woman standing before Him. 
When Jesus stood up and saw no 
one but, the woman, He said to 
her, "Woman, where are your 
accusers? Has no one condemned 
you?" 

" 'She said, "No one, Lord." 

" 'And Jesus said to her, "Nor 
do I condemn you. Go, and sin 
no more." ' " 

R DANEEL listened attentive• ly. He said, "What is adultery?" 

"That doesn't matter. It was a 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



crime for which the accepted punishment was stoning — that is, 
stones were thrown until the guilty one was killed." 

"And the woman was guilty?" 

"She was." 

"Then why was she not 
stoned ?" 

"None of the accusers felt he 
could after Jesus' statement. The 
story is meant to show that there 
is something even higher than 
the justice which you have been 
filled with. There is a human impulse known as mercy, a human 
act known as forgiveness." 

"I am not acquainted with 
those words, partner Elijah." 

"I know," muttered Baley. "I 
know." 

He started the squad-car with 
a jerk and let it tear forward 
savagely. He was pressed back 
against the cushions of the seat. 

"Where are we going?" asked 
R. Daneel. 

"To Yeast Town," said Baley, 
"to get the truth out of Francis 
Clousarr, conspirator." 

"You have a method for doing 
this, Elijah?" 

"Not I, exactly. But you have, 
Daneel — a simple one." 

They sped onward. 

CHAPTER XV 

"DALEY could feel the vague 
aroma of Yeast Town growing stronger. He did not find it 



as unpleasant as some did — Jes 
sie, for instance. Actually, he 
rather liked it. It had pleasant 
connotations. 

Every time he smelled raw 
yeast, the alchemy of sense-per 
ception carried him more than 
three decades into the past. He 
was a ten-year-old again, visiting 
his uncle Boris, who was a yeast 
farmer. Uncle Boris always had 
a little supply of yeast-delectables — small cookies, chocolaty 
things filled with sweet liquid, 
hard confections in the shape of 
cats and dogs. Young as he was, 
he knew that uncle Boris 
shouldn't really have had them to 
give away and he always ate 
them very quietly, sitting in a 
corner with his back to the center 
of the room. He would eat them 
quickly for fear of being caught. 

They tasted all the better for 
that. 

Poor uncle Boris! He had had 
an accident and died. They had 
never told him exactly how, and 
he had cried bitterly, because he 
thought" uncle Boris had been arrested for smuggling yeast out of 
the plant. He expected to be arrested and executed himself. 
Years later, he had poked carefully through police files and 
learned the truth. Uncle Boris 
had fallen beneath the treads of 
a transport. It was a disillusioning ending to a romantic myth. 

Yet the myth would always 



e 
t 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



121 



arise in his mind, at least momentarily, whenever his nostrils 
caught a whiff of raw yeast. 

Yeast Town was not the official 
name of any part of New York 
City. It could be found in no 
gazetteer and on no official map. 
What was called Yeast Town in 
popular speech was, to the Post 
Office, merely the boroughs of 
Newark, New Brunswick and 
Trenton. It was a broad strip 
across what had once been Medieval New Jersey, dotted with residential areas, particularly in 
Newark Center and Trenton Center, but given over mostly to the 
many-layered farms in which a 
thousand varieties of yeast grew 
and multiplied. 

One -fifth of the City's productive population worked in the 
yeast farms — another fifth worked in the subsidiary industries. 
Beginning with the mountains of 
wood and coarse cellulose that 
were dragged into the City from 
the tangled forests of the Alleghenies — through the vats of acid 
that hydrolized it to glucose — 
the carloads of niter and phosphate rock that were the most 
important additives— down, to the 
jars. of organics supplied by the 
chemical laboratories — it all came 
to only one thing : yeast and 
more yeast. 

Without yeast, six of Earth's 
eight billions would starve in a 
year. 



Baley felt cold at the thought. 
Three days before, the possibility had existed as deeply as it did 
now. But, three days before, it 
would never have occurred to 
him. 

fTTHEY whizzed out of the Motorway through an exit on 
the Newark outskirts. The thinly 
populated avenues, flanked on 
either side by the featureless 
blocks that were the farms, offered little to check their speed. 

"What time is it, Daneel?" 
asked Baley. 

"Sixteen- oh -five,'* replied R. 
Daneel. 

"Then he'll be at work, if he's 
on day-shift." 

Baley parked the squad-car in 
a delivery recess and froze the 
controls. 

"This is New York Yeast, Elijah?" asked the robot. 

"Part of it," said Baley. 

They entered a corridor flanked 
by a double row of offices. A receptionist at a bend in the corridor gave them an automatic 
smile. "Whom do you wish to 
see?" 

Baley opened his wallet. "Police. Is there a Francis Clousarr 
working for New York Yeast?" 

The girl looked perturbed. "I 
can check." 

She connected her switchboard 
through a line plainly marked 
Personnel and her lips moved 



\22 




 



slightly, though no sound could 
be heard, 

Baley was no stranger to the 
throat-phones that translated the 
sub-vocalization of the larynx into words. He said, "Speak up, 
please. Let me hear you." 

Her words became audible, but 
consisted only of, ". . . he says 
he's a policeman, sir." 

A dark, well-dressed man came 
out through a door. He had a 
thin mustache and his hairline 
was beginning to retreat. He 
smiled mirthlessly and said, "I'm 
Prescott of Personnel. What's the 
trouble, Officer ?" 

Baley stared at him coldly and 
Prescott's smile grew strained. He 
added, "I just don't want to upset 
the workers. They're touchy 
about the police." 

Baley said, "Tough, isn't it? 
Is Clousarr in the building now?" 

"Yes, Officer." 

"Let's have a rod then. If he's 
gone when we get there, I'll be 
speaking to you again." 

The other's smile was quite 
dead. He muttered, "I'll get you 
a rod, Officer." 

'PHE guide-rod was set for Department CG, Section 2. 
What that meant in factory 
terminology, Baley didn't know. 
He didn't have to. The rod was 
an inconspicuous thing which 
could be palmed in the hand. Its 
tip warmed gently when lined up 



in the direction for which it was 
set, cooled quickly when turned 
away. The warmth increased as 
the final goal was approached. 

To an amateur, the guide-rod 
was almost useless, with its quick 
little differences of heat content. 
But few City-dwellers were amateurs at this particular game. One 
of the most popular and perennial of the games of childhood 
was hide-and -seek through the 
school-level corridors with the 
use of toy guide-rods— "Hot or 
Not, let Hot-Spot Spot. Hot-Spot 
Guide-Rods Are Keen." 
. Baley had found his way 
through hundreds of massive piles 
by guide-rod, and he could follow the shortest course with one 
of them in his hand as though it 
had been mapped out for him. 

When he stepped into a large 
and brilliantly lit room after ten 
minutes, the guide-rod's tip was 
almost hot. 

Baley said to the worker nearest the door, "Francis Clousarr 
here?" 

The worker jerked his head. 
Baley walked in the indicated direction. The odor of yeast was 
sharp, despite the laboring airpumps whose humming made a 
steady background noise. 

A man had risen at the other 
end of the room and was taking 
off an apron. He was of moderate height, his face deeply lined, though he was comparatively 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



123 



youthful, and his hair just beginning to grizzle. He had large 
knobby hands, which he wiped 
slowly on a celltex towel. 

"I'm Francis Clousarr," he 
said. 

Baley looked briefly at R. Dane el. 

The robot nodded. 

"Okay," said Baley. "Anywhere we can talk?" 

"Maybe," said Clousarr slowly. "But its just about the end of 
my shift. How about tomorrow?" 

"Lots of hours between now 
and tomorrow. Let's make it 
now." Baley opened his wallet 
and displayed it to the yeast 
farmer. 

But Clousarr' s hands did not 
waver in their somber wiping 
motions. He said coolly, "I don't 
know the system in the Police 
Department, but around here you 
get tight eating hours with no 
leeway. I eat at 1700 to 1745 or 
I don't eat." 

"It's all right," said Baley. "I'll 
arrange to have your supper 
brought to you." 

"Well, well," said Clousarr 
joylessly. "Just like an aristocrat or a C-class copper. What's 
next — private bath?" 

"You just answer questions, 
Clousarr," said Baley, "and save 
your big jokes for your girlfriend. Where can we talk?" 

"If you want to talk, how 
about the balance room? Suit 



yourself about that. Me, I've got 
nothing to say — nothing at all." 

"DALEY thumbed Clousarr into the balance room. It was 
square and antiseptic ally white, 
air-conditioned independently of 
the" larger room — and more efficiently. Its walls were lined with 
delicate electronic balances, glassed off and manipulated by fieldforces only. Baley had used 
cheaper models in his college 
days. One make, which he recognized, weighed a mere billion 
atoms. 

Clousarr said, "I don't think 
anyone will come in here." 

Baley grunted, then turned to 
Daneel and said, "Would you 
step out and have a meal sent up 
here? And, if you don't mind, 
wait outside for it." 

He watched R. Daneel leave, 
then said to Clousarr, "You're a 
chemist?" 

"I'm a zymologist, if you don't 
mind." 

"What's the difference?" 

Clousarr looked lofty. "A 
chemist is a soup-pusher, a stinkoperator. A zymologist is a man 
who helps keep a few .billion people alive. I'm a yeast-culture specialist." 

"All right," said Baley. "Continue talking." 

But Clousarr was not to be diverted. "This laboratory keeps 
New York Yeast going. There 



124 




 



isn't a day, not one hour, that we 
haven't got cultures of every 
strain of yeast in the Company 
growing in our kettles. We check 
and adjust the food-factor requirements. We make sure it's 
breeding true. We twist the genetics, start the new strains and 
weed them out, sort their properties and mold them again. 

"When New Yorkers started 
getting strawberries out of season 
a couple of years back, those 
weren't strawberries, fella. Those 
were a special high-sugar yeast 
culture with a true-bred color 
and just a dash of flavor additive. It was developed right here 
in this room. 

"Twenty years ago, Saccharomyces olei Benedictae was just 
a scrub strain with a lousy taste 
of tallow and good for nothing. 
It still tastes of tallow, but its 
fat content has been pushed up 
from fifteen per cent to eightyseven. 1 If you used the Expressway today, just remember that 
it's greased strictly with S. O. 
Benedictae, Strain AG-7 '. Developed right here in this room. 

"So don't call me chemist. I'm 
a zymologist." 

Despite himself, Baley was impressed by the fierce pride of the 
other. 

He said abruptly, "Where were 
you last night between the hours 
of 18 and 20?" 

Clousarr shrugged. "Walking. 



I like to take a little walk after 
dinner." 

"You visited friends? Or a 
sub-etheric?" 

"No. Just walked." 

T IJE Baley's lips tightened. A 
*~* visit to the sub-etherics would 
have involved a notch in Clousarr* s ration plack. A meeting 
with a friend would have involved naming a man or woman and 
offered a cross-check. 

"No one saw you then?" 

"Maybe someone did. I don't 
know. Not that I know of, 
though." 

"What about the night before 
last?" 

"Same thing." 

"You have no alibi then for 
either night?" 

"If I had done anything criminal, I'd have one. What do I 
need an alibi for?" 

Baley didn't answer. He consulted his little book. "You were 
up before the magistrate once. 
Inciting to riot." 

"All right. One of the R-things 
pushed past me and I tripped 
him up. Is that inciting to riot?" 

"The court thought so. You 
were convicted and fined." 

"That ends it, doesn't it? Or 
do you want to fine me again?" 

"Night before last, there was a 
near-riot at a shoe department 
in the Bronx. You were seen 
there." 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



"By whom?" 

Baley said, "It was at mealtime for you here. Did you eat 
the evening meal night before 
last?" 

Clousarr hesitated, then shook 
his head- "Upset stomach. Yeast 
gets you that way sometimes. 
Even an old-timer like me." 

"Last night, there was a nearriot in Williamsburg and you 
were seen there." 

"By whom?" 

"Do you deny you were present on both occasions?" 

"You're not giving me anything to deny. Where did these 
things happen and who says he 
saw me?" 

Baley stared at the zymologist 
Ievelly. "I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. I 
think you're an important man 
in an unregistered Medievalist 
organization." 

"I can't stop you from thinking. Officer, but thinking isn't 
evidence. Maybe you know that." 
Clousarr was grinning. 

"Maybe," said Baley, his long 
face stony, "I can get a little 
truth out of you right now." 

Baley stepped to the door of 
the balance room and opened it. 
•He said to R. Daneel, who was 
waiting stolidly outside, "Has 
Clousarr's evening meal arrived?" 

"It is coming now, Elijah." 
"Bring it in, will you, Daneel?" 



"TVANEEL entered a moment 
'-'later with a compartmented 
metal tray. 

"Put it in front of Mr. Clousarr, Daneel," said Baley. He sat 
down on one of the stools that 
lined the balance wall with his 
legs crossed and one shoe swinging rhythmically. He watched 
Clousarr edge stiffly away as R. 
Daneel placed the tray on a stool 
near the zymologist. 

"Francis Clousarr," said Baley, 
"I want to introduce you to my 
partner, Daneel Olivaw." 

Daneel put out his hand and 
said, "How do you do, Francis." 

Clousarr said nothing. He made 
no move to grasp Daneel's extended hand. Daneel maintained 
his position and Clousarr began 
to redden. 

Baley said softly, "You are being rude, Mr. Clousarr. Are you 
too proud to shake hands with 
a policeman?" 

Clousarr muttered, "If you 
don't mind, I'm hungry." He unfolded a pocket-fork out of a 
clasp-knife he took from his 
pocket and sat down, his eyes on 
his meal. 

Baley said, "Daneel, I think 
our friend is offended by your 
official attitude. You are not angry with him, are you?" 

"Not at all, Elijah," said R. 
Daneel. 

"Then show that there are no 
hard feelings. Put your arm 



126 




 




about his shoulder." 

"I will be glad to," said R. Daneel. He stepped forward. 

Clousarr put down his fork. 
"What is this? What's going on?" 

R. Daneel. unruffled, put out 
his arm. 

Clousarr swung back-handed 
wildly, knocking R. Daneel's arm 
to one side. "Damn it, don't 
touch me!" 

He jumped up and away, the 
tray of food tipping and hitting 
the floor in a messy clatter. 

Baley, hard-eyed, nodded curtly to R. Daneel, who continued 



a stolid advance toward the retreating zymologist. Baley stepped in front of the door. 

Clousarr yelled, "Keep that 
thing away from me!" 

"That's no way to speak." said 
Baley with equanimity. "The 
man's my partner." 

"You mean he's a damned robot!" 

"All right, let him alone. Daneel," said Baley promptly. 

R. Daneel stepped back and 
stood quietly against the door 
just behind Baley. Clousarr, 
panting harshly, his fists clench


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



127 



ed, his face White, faced Baley. 

Baley said, "All right, smart 
boy. What makes you think Daneel's a robot?" 

"Anyone can tell!" 

"We'll leave that to a judge. 
Meanwhile, we want "you at headquarters, Clousarr. We'd like to 
have you explain exactly how you 
knew Daneel was a robot. And 
lots more, mister, lots more. Daneel, step outside and get through 
to the Commissioner. He'll be at 
his home by now. Ask him to 
come down to the office. Tell him 
I have a fellow who can't wait to 
be questioned." 

R. Daneel stepped out of the 
room. 

T) ALEY said, "What makes 
your wheels go round, Clousarr?" 

"I want a lawyer." 

"You'll get one. Meanwhile, 
suppose you tell me what makes 
you Medievalists tick." 

Clousarr looked away in a determined silence. 

Baley said, "We know all about 
you and your organization. I'm 
not bluffing. Just tell me for 
my own curiosity — what do you 
Medievalists warir?" 
' "Back to the soil," said Clousarr in a stifled voice. "That's 
simple, isn't it?" 

"It's simple to say, but isn't 
simple to do. How's the soil going to feed eight billions?" 



"Did I say back to the soil overnight? Or in a year? Or in a 
hundred years? Step by step. It 
doesn't matter how long it takes, 
but let's get started out of these 
caves we live in. Let's get out into the fresh air." 

"Have you ever been out in 
the fresh air?" 

Clousarr squirmed. "All right, 
so I'm ruined, too. But the children aren't ruined yet. Get them 
out, for God's sake. Let them 
have space and open air and sun. 
If we've got to, we can cut our 
population little by little." 

"Backward to an impossible 
past." Baley did not really know 
why he was arguing, except for 
the strange fever that was burning in his own veins. "Back to the 
seed, to the egg, to the womb. 
Why not move forward instead? 
Don't cut Earth's population. Use 
it for export. Go back to the soil, 
but go back to the soil of other 
planets. Colonize !" 

Clousarr laughed harshly. 
"And make more Outer Worlds? 
More Spacers?" 

"We won't. The Outer Worlds 
were settled by Earthmen who 
came from a planet that did not 
have Cities — by Earthmen who 
were individualists and materialists. Those qualities were carried to an unhealthy extreme. We 
can now colonize out of a society 
that has carried cooperation, if 
anything, too far. Now environ


126 




 



merit and tradition can interact 
to form a new middle way, distinct from either old Earth or 
the Outer Worlds. Something 
newer and better." 

He was parroting Dr. Fastolfe, 
he knew, but it was coming out 
as though he himself had been 
thinking of it for years. 

Clousarr said, "Yeast ! Colonize desert worlds instead of developing our own? What fools 
would try?" 

"Many — and they wouldn't be 
fools. There'd be robots to help." 

"No," said Clousarr fiercely. 
"Never! No robots!" 

"Why not, for God's sake? 
What are we afraid of in robots? 
If you want my guess, we all feel 
inferior to the Spacers and hate 
it. We've got to feel superior 
somehow, somewhere, to make up 
for it. It kills us that we can't at 
least feel superior to robots. They 
seem to be better than us — only 
they're nor. That's the irony of 
it." 

J IJE Baley felt his blood heating as he spoke. "Look at 
Daneel. I've been with him for 
over two days. He's taller than 
I am, stronger, handsomer. He 
looks like a Spacer, in fact. He's 
got a better memory and knows 
more facts. He doesn't have to 
sleep or eat. He's not troubled by 
sickness or panic or love or guilt. 
"But he's a machine. I can do 



anything I want to him, the way 
I can to that micro-balance right 
there. If I slam the micro-balance, it wcyi't hit me back. Neither will Daneel. I can order him 
to use a blaster on himself and 
he'll do it. 

"We can't ever build a robot 
that will be as good as a human 
being in anything that counts. 
We can't create a robot with a 
sense of beauty or a sense of ethics or a sense of religion. There's 
no way we can raise a positronic 
brain one inch above the level 
of absolute materialism. 

"We can't, damn it — not as 
long as we don't understand what 
makes our own brains tick. Not 
as long as things exist that science can't measure. What is 
beauty, or goodness, or art, or 
love, or God? We're forever teetering on the brink of the unknowable, trying to understand what 
can't be understood. It's what 
makes us men. 

"A robot's brain must be finite 
or it can't be built. It must 
be calculated to the final decimal 
place, so that it has an end. Jehoshaphat, what are you afraid 
of? A robot can look like Daneel, 
he can look like a god, and yet 
be no more human than a blob 
of yeast. Can't you see that?" 

Clousarr had tried to interrupt several times and failed 
against Baley's furious torrent. 
Now, when Baley paused in sheer 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



729 



emotional exhaustion, he said 
weakly, "Copper turned philosopher. Well, what do you know?" 




DANEEL re-entered. Baley looked .at him and 



frowned, partly with the anger 
that had not yet left him, partly 
with new annoyance. 

"What kept you?" he demanded. 

R. Daneel said, "I had trouble 
reaching Commissioner Enderby, 
Elijah. It turned out that he was 
still at his office." 

Baley looked at his watch. 
"Now? What for?" 

"There is a certain confusion 
at the moment. A corpse has 
been discovered in the Department." 

"What! For God's sake, who?" 

"The errand boy — R. Sammy." 

Baley gulped. He stared at the 
robot and stated in an outraged 
voice, "I thought you said a 
corpse." 

R. Daneel amended smoothly, 
"A robot with a completely deactivated brain, if you prefer." 

Clousarr laughed suddenly and 
Baley turned on him, saying 
savagely, "Nothing out of you!> 
Understand?" Deliberately, he 
unlimbered his blaster. Clousarr 
fell silent. 

Baley said. "Well, what of it? 
R. Sammy blew a fuse. So what?" 

"Commissioner Enderby was 
evasive. Elijah, but while he did 



not say so outright, my impression is that he believes R. Sammy was deliberately deactivated." 

Then, as Baley absorbed that 
silently, R. Daneel added" gravely, "Or if you prefer the phrase — 
murdered." 

CHAPTER XVI 

T>ALEY replaced his blaster, 
but kept his hand unobtrusively upon its butt. He said, 
"Walk ahead of us, Clousarr, to 
17th Street Exit B." 

Clousarr said, "I haven't eaten." 

"There's your meal on the floor, 
where you dumped it." 

"I have a right to eat." 

1 'You'll eat in Detention or 
you'll miss a meal. You won't 
starve. Get going." 

All three were silent as they 
threaded the maze of New York 
Yeast — Clousarr moving stonily 
in advance, Baley right behind 
him, R. Daneel in the rear. 

It was after Baley and R. Daneel had checked out at the receptionist's desk, after Clousarr 
had drawn a leave of absence, after they were out in the open 
alongside the parked squad-car, 
that Clousarr said, "Just a minute." 

He hung back, turned toward 
R. Daneel and, before Baley 
could make a move to stop him, 
stepped forward and swung his 



130 




 



open hand full against the robot's 
cheek. 

"What the devil!" cried Baley, 
grabbing violently at Clousarr. 

Clousarr did not resist the 
plainclothesman's grasp. "It's all 
right. I'll go along with you. I 
just wanted to see for myself." 
He was grinning. 

R. Daneel, having rolled with 
the slap, but not having escaped 
it entirely, gazed quietly at Clousarr. There was no reddening of 
his cheek, no mark of any blow, 
at all. 

He said, "That was a dangerous 
action, Francis. Had I not moved 
backward, you might easily have 
damaged your hand. As it is, I 
regret that I must have caused 
you pain." 

Clousarr laughed. 

Baley said, "Get in, Clousarr. 
You too, Daneel — right in the 
back seat with him. And make 
sure he doesn't move. I don't care 
if it means breaking his arm. 
That's an order." 

"What about the First Law?" 
mocked Clousarr. 

"I think Daneel is strong 
enough and fast enough to stop 
you without hurting you. But it 
might do you good to have an 
arm or two broken, at that." 

Baley got behind the wheel and 
the squad-car gathered speed. 
The empty wind ruffled his hair 
and Clousarr's, but R. Daneel's 
remained smoothly in place. 



R DANEEL said quietly to 
• Clousarr, "Do you fear 
robots for the sake of your job, 
Mr. Clousarr?" 

Baley could not turn to see 
Clousarr's expression, but he was 
certain it would be hard and rigid with detestation. 

Clousarr's voice replied, "And 
my kids* jobs. And everyone's 
kids." 

"Surely adjustments are possible," said the robot. "If your 
children, for instance, were to accept training for emigration — " 

Clousarr broke in. "You, too? 
The policeman talked about emigration. He's got good robot 
training. Maybe he is a robot." 

Baley growled, "That's enough, 
you!" 

R. Daneel said evenly, "A 
training school for emigrants 
would bring about security, guaranteed classification, an assured 
career. If you are concerned over 
your children, that is something 
to consider." 

"I wouldn't take anything from 
a robot, or a Spacer, or any of 
the trained hyenas in the Government." 

That was all. The silence of 
the Motorway engulfed them and 
there was only the soft whirr of 
the squad-car motor and the hiss 
of its wheels on the pavement until they reached the Department. 

Baley signed a detention certificate for Clousarr and left him 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



131 



in appropriate hands. Following 
that, he and R. Daneel took the 
Motospiral up the levels to 
Headquarters. 

R. Daneel showed no surprise 
that they had not taken the elevators, nor did Baley expect him 
to. He was becoming used to the 
robot's queer mixture of initiative and compliance and tended 
to leave him out of his calculations. The elevator was the logical method of leaping the vertical 
gap between Detention and Headquarters. The long moving stairway that was the Motospiral was 
useful only for short climbs or 
drops of two or three levels at 
most. People of all sorts and varieties of administrative occupation stepped on and then off in 
less than a minute. Only Baley 
and R. Daneel remained on continuously, moving upward in a 
slow and stolid measure. 

Baley felt he needed the time. 
It was only minutes at best, but 
up in Headquarters he would be 
thrown violently against another 
phase of the problem and he 
wanted a rest. He wanted time to 
think, to orient himself. Slowly 
as it moved, the Motospiral went 
too quickly to satisfy him. 

|~|ANEEL said, "It seems then 
we will not be questioning 
Clousarr just yet." 

"He'll keep," said Baley irritably. 



"It is a pity. His cerebric qualities — " 

"What about them?" 

"They have changed in a 
strange way. What took place 
between the two of you in the 
balance room while I was not 
present?" 

Baley said absently, "I passed 
along the Gospel according to St. 
Fastolfe." 

"I do not understand you, 
Elijah." 

Baley sighed. "I preached emigration, just as he told you in 
the squad-car." 

"I see. And what did you tell 
him about robots?" 

"You really want to know? I 
told him robots were simply machines. That was the Gospel according to St. Gerrigel. There are 
any number of gospels, I think-" 

"Did you by any chance tell 
him that one could strike a robot 
without fear of a return blow, 
much as one could strike any 
other mechanical object?" 

"Except a punching bag. I suppose. Yes — but what made you 
guess that?" Baley looked curiously at the robot. 

"It fits the cerebric changes," 
said R. Daneel, "and it explains 
his blow to my face just after we 
left the factory. He must have 
been thinking of what you said, 
so he simultaneously tested your 
statement, worked off his aggressive feelings and had the pleasure 



132 




 



of seeing me placed in. what 
seemed to him a position of inferiority. In order to be so motivated and allowing for the delta 
variations in his quintic . . ." 

He paused a long moment. 
"Yes, it is quite interesting. I 
believe I can form a self-consistent whole of the data." 

Headquarters level was approaching. Baley said, "What 
time is it?" 

He thought pettishly: Yeast! 
I could look at my watch. It's 
faster. 

But he knew why he asked. 
His motive was not so different 
from Clousarr's in punching R. 
Daneel. By giving the robot a 
trivial order that he must fulfill, 
he emphasized R. Daneel's mechanical nature and,' contrariwise, his own humanity. 

Baley thought: We're all 
brothers. Under the skin, over it, 
everywhere. Jeshoshaphat! 

R. Daneel said, "Twenty-ten." 

They stepped off the Motospiral and, for a few seconds, 
Baley had the usual queer sensation that went with adjustment 
to non-motion. 

He said, "And I haven't eaten. 
Damn this job, anyway." 

T?LIJAH saw and heard Commissioner Enderby through 
the open door of his office. The 
Common Room was empty and 
Enderby's voice rang through it. 



His round face looked bare and 
weak without its glasses, which 
he held in his hand while he 
mopped his smooth forehead 
with a paper tissue. 

His eyes caught Baley just as 
the latter reached the door, his 
voice rose in a petulant tenor. 
"Good God, Baley, where the 
devil were you?" 

Baley shrugged off the complaint and said, "What's doing? 
Where's the night-shift?" And 
then he caught sight of the second person in the office with the 
Commissioner. He added blankly, "Dr. Gerrigel!" 

The gray-haired roboticist returned the involuntary greeting 
by nodding briefly. "Glad to see 
you again, Mr. Baley." 

The Commissioner readjusted 
his glasses and stared at Baley 
through them. "The entire staff 
is being questioned downstairs. 
Signing statements. I was going 
mad trying to find you. It looked queer, your being away." 

"My being away!" 

"Anybody's being away. Someone in the Department did it 
and there's going to be hell to 
pay. What an unholy mess! What 
an unholy rotten mess!" 

He raised his hands as though 
in expostulation to heaven and, 
as he did so, his eyes fell on R. 
Daneel. 

Baley thought sardonically : 
First time you've looked Daneel 



THE CAVES Of STEEL 



133 



in the face. Take a good look, 
Julius ! 

The Commissioner said in a 
subdued voice, "He'll have to 
sign a statement. Even I've had 
to do it. Me!" 

Baley said, "Look, " Commissioner, what makes you so sure 
that R. Sammy didn't blow a 
gasket all by himself? How do 
you know it was deliberate destruction?" 

The Commissioner sat down 
heavily. "Ask him," he said and 
pointed to Dr. Gerrigel. 

Dr. Gerrigel cleared his throat. 
"I scarcely know how to go about 
this, Mr. Baley. I take it from 
your expression that you are surprised to see me." 

"Moderately," admitted Baley. 

"Well, I was in no real hurry 
to return to Washington, and my 
visits to New York are few 
enough to make me wish to linger. More important, I felt it 
would be criminal for me to 
leave the City without at least 
one more effort to be allowed to 
analyze your fascinating robot, 
whom, by the way — " he looked 
very eager — "I see you have 
with you." 

"Impossible. He's Spacer property." 

The roboticist looked disappointed. "Perhaps you might ask 
them for permission." 

Baley's long face remained 
woodenly unresponsive. 



TAR. GERRIGEL went on. "t 
called you, but you weren't 
in. No one knew where you could 
be located. I asked for the Commissioner and he asked me to 
come to headquarters and wait 
for you." 

The Commissioner interposed 
quickly, "I thought it might be 
important. I knew you wanted 
to see the man." 

Baley nodded. "Thanks." 

Dr. Gerrigel said, "Unfortunately, my guide-rod was somewhat off, or, perhaps in my 
over-anxiety, I misjudged its 
temperature. In either case, I 
took a wrong turning and found 
myself in a small room — " 

The Commissioner interrupted 
again. "One of the photographic 
supply rooms, Lije." 

"Yes," said Dr. Gerrigel. "And 
in it was the prone figure of 
what was obviously a robot. It 
was quite clear to me after a 
brief examination that he was 
irreversibly deactivated. Dead, 
you might say. Nor was it very 
difficult to determine the cause 
of the deactivation." 

"What was it?" asked Baley. 

"In the robot's partly clenched 
right fist," said Dr. Gerrigel, "was 
a shiny ovoid about two inches 
long and half an inch wide, with 
a mica window at one end. The 
fist was in contact with his skull 
as though the robot's last act 
had been to touch his head. The 



134 




 



thing he was holding was an 
alpha -sprayer. You know what 
they are, I suppose?" 

Baley nodded. He had handled 
several in his lab courses in 
physics. An alpha -sprayer was 
a lead-alloy casing with a narrow pit dug into it longitudinally, 
at the bottom of which was a 
fragment of a plutonium salt. 
The pit was capped with a sliver 
of mica, which was transparent 
to alpha particles. In that one 
direction, hard radiation sprayed 
out. 

An alpha-sprayer had many 
uses, but killing robots was not 
one of them— not a legal one, at 
least. 

Baley said, "He held it to his 
head mica-first?" 



"Yes, and his positronic brainpaths were immediately randomized. Instant death, so to 
speak." 

Baley turned to the pale Commissioner. "No mistake? It really 
was an alpha -sprayer?" 

The Commissioner nodded, his 
lips pursed. "Absolutely. The 
counters could spot it ten feet 
away. Photographic film in the 
storeroom was fogged. Open and 
shut." 

He seemed to brood about it 
a moment or two, then said 
abruptly, "Dr. Gerrigel, I'm 
afraid you'll have to stay in the 
City until we get your evidence 
down on wire-film. I'll have you 
escorted to a room. You won't 
mind being under guard, I hope?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



135 



Dr. Gerrigel asked nervously, 
"Do you think it's necessary?" 
"It's safer." 

Dr. Gerrigel, seemingly quite 
abstracted, shook hands all 
around, even with R. Daneel. He 
left. 

The Commissioner heaved a 
sigh. "It's one of us, Lije. That's 
what bothers me. No outsider 
would come into the Department 
just to knock off a robot. Plenty 
of them outside where it's safer. 
And it had to be somebody who 
could pick up an alpha- sprayer. 
They're hard to get hold of." 

R DANEEL spoke, his cool, 
• even voice in contrast with 
the agitated tone of the Commissioner. He said, "But what is the 
motive for this murder?" 

The Commissioner glanced at 
R. Daneel with obvious distaste, 
then looked away. "We're human, too, unfortunately. I suppose policemen can't get to like 
robots any more than anyone 
else can. He's gone now, and 
maybe it's a relief to somebody. 
He used to annoy you considerably, Lije, remember." 

"That is scarcely a murder 
motive," said R. Daneel. 

"No," agreed Baley with decision. 

"It isn't murder," said the 
Commissioner. "It's property 
damage. Let's keep our legal 
terms straight. It's just that it 



was done inside the Department. 
Anywhere else, it would be nothing. Here it could be a first-class 
scandal. Lije!" 
"Yes?" 

"When did you last see R. 
Sammy?" 

Baley said, "R. Daneel spoke 
to R. Sammy after lunch. 1 
should judge it was about 13:30. 
He arranged to have us use your 
office, Commissioner." 

"My office? What for?" 

"I wanted to talk over the case 
with R. Daneel in moderate privacy. You weren't in, so your 
office was an obvious choice." 

"I see," the Commissioner 
looked dubious, but let the matter ride. "You didn't see him 
yourself?" 

"No, but I heard his voice, 
perhaps an hour afterward." 

"That would be about 14:30?" 

"Or a little sooner." 

The Commissioner bit his lower lip thoughtfully-. "Well, that 
settles one thing. The boy — Vincent Barrett — was here today." 

"I know. But he wouldn't do 
this." 

'T^HE Commissioner lifted his 
eyes to Baley's face. "Why 
not? R. Sammy took his job 
away. I can understand how he 
feels. There would be a tremendous sense of injustice. He'd want 
revenge. Wouldn't you? But the 
fact is that he left the building 



136 




 



at 14:00 and you heard R. Sammy alive at 14:30. Of course, he 
might have given the alphasprayer to R. Sammy before he 
left, with instructions not to use 
it for an hour. But where could 
he have gotten an alpha-sprayer? 
No, it doesn't hold up. Let's get 
back to R. Sammy. When you 
spoke to him at 14:30, what did 
he say?" 

Baley hesitated a perceptible 
moment, then replied carefully, 
"I don't remember. We left shortly afterward." 

"Where did you go?" 

"Yeast Town, eventually." 

The Commissioner rubbed his 
chin. "Jessie was in today. We 
checked on all visitors, of course. 
Why did she come here?" 

"Family matters." 

"I'm afraid she'll have to be 
questioned." 

"I understand police routine, 
Commissioner. Incidentally, what 
about the alpha-spray itself? Has 
it been traced?" 

"Oh, yes. It came from one of 
the power plants." 

"How do they account for having lost it?" 

"They don't. They have no 
idea. But look, Lije, except for 
routine statements, this has nothing to do with you. You stick to 
your case. It's just that . . . Well, 
you stick to the Spacetown investigation." 

Baley said, "May I give my 



routine statements later, Commissioner? I haven't eaten yet." 

Commissioner Enderby blinked. "By all means, get something 
to eat. But stay inside the Department, will you? Your partner's right, though, Lije — " he 
seemed to avoid addressing R. 
Daneel or using his name — "It's 
the motive we need." 

Baley felt suddenly frozen. 
Something outside himself, something completely alien, took up 
the events of this day and the 
day before and the day before 
that and juggled them. A pattern 
began to form. 

He said, "Which power plant 
did the alpha-sprayer come 
from, Commissioner?" 

"The Williamsburg plant. 
Why?" 

"Nothing — noth ing." 

The last word Baley heard the 
Commissioner mutter as he 
strode out of the office, with R. 
Daneel immediately behind him, 
was, "Motive. Motive." 

¥>ALEY ate a sparse meal in 
the small and infrequently 
used Department lunch room. He 
devoured a stuffed tomato on 
lettuce without noticing what he 
was eating. For a second or so, 
after he had gulped down the 
last mouthful, his fork still 
slithered aimlessly over the slick 
disposable plate, searching automatically for something that was 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



137 



no longer there. 

He became aware of it and put 
down his fork with a muffled, 
"Jehoshaphat!" He said, "Daneel!" 

R. Daneel had been sitting at 
another table, as though he wished to leave the obviously preoccupied Baley in peace, or as 
though he required privacy himself. Baley was past caring which. 

Daneel stood up, moved to 
Baley's table and sat down again. 
"Yes, partner Elijah?" 

Baley did not look at him. 
"Daneel, they'll question Jessie 
and myself. Let me answer the 
questions in my own way, understand ?" 

"What if I am asked a direct 
question? It is not possible for 
me to saying anything but what 
is so." 

"I f you are asked a direct 
question, very well. Just don't 
volunteer information. You can 
do that, can't you?" 

"I believe so, Elijah, provided 
it does not mean that I am hurting a human being by remaining 
silent." 

Baley said grimly, "You'll hurt 
me if you don't. I assure you of 
that." 

* "I do not quite comprehend 
your point of view, partner Elijah. Surely the matter of R. 
Sammy cannot concern you." 

"No? It all centers about 
motive, doesn't? You've ques


tioned the motive. The Commissioner questioned it. I question 
it myself, for that matter. Why 
should anyone want to kill R. 
Sanimy? Mind you, it's not just 
a question of who would want to 
smash up robots in general. 
Practically any Earthman would 
want to do that. 

"The question is, who would 
want to single out R. Sammy? 
Vincent Barrett might, but the 
Commissioner said he couldn't 
get hold of an alpha -sprayer, 
and he's right. We have to look 
somewhere else and it so happens 
that one other person has a motive. It glares out. It yells. It 
stinks to top level." 

"Who is the person, Elijah?" 

Baley said softly, "I am, 
Daneel." 

RDANEEL'S expressionless 
• face did not change under 
the impact of the statement. He 
merely shook his head. 

Baley said, "You don't agree? 
My wife came to the office today. They know that already. 
Even the Commissioner is curious. If I weren't a personal friend, 
he wouldn't have stopped his 
questioning so soon. Now they'll 
find out why. That's certain. She 
was part of a conspiracy — a foolish and harmless one, but a conspiracy just the same. And a 
policeman can't afford to have 
his wife mixed up with anything 



138 




 



like that. It would be to my obvious interest to see that the matter was hushed up. 

"Well, who knew about it?" 
he added. "You and I, of course, 
and Jessie — -and R. Sammy. He 
saw her in a state of panic. When 
he told her that we had left orders not to be disturbed, she 
must have lost control. You saw 
how she was when she came in." 

R, Daneel said, "It is unlikely 
that she said anything incriminating to him." 

"That may be so. But I'm reconstructing the case the way 
they will. They'll say she did. 
There's my motive, I killed him 
to keep him quiet." 

"They will not think so." 

"They will think so. The murder was arranged deliberately in 
order to throw suspicion on me. 
Why use an alpha-sprayer? It's 
a rather risky weapon. It's hard 
to get and it can be traced. I believe those were the very reasons 
it was used. The murderer even 
ordered R. Sammy to go into the 
photographic supply room and 
kill himself there. It seems obvious to me that the reason for that 
was to have the method of murder unmistakable. Even if everyone was infantile enough not to 
recognize the alpha-sprayer immediately, someone would be 
bound to notice fogged photographic film in fairly short 
order." 

THE CAVES OF STEEl 



"How does all this relate to 
you, Elijah?" 

Baley grinned nervously, his 
long face completely devoid of 
humor. "Very neatly. The alphasprayer was taken from the Williamsburg power plant. You and 
I passed through the Williamsburg power plant yesterday. We 
were seen and that fact will come 
out. That gives me opportunity 
to get the weapon as well as motive for the crime. And it may 
turn out that we were the last 
ones to see or hear R. Sammy 
alive — except for the real murderer, of course." 

"I was with you in the power 
plant. I can testify that you did 
not have the opportunity to steal 
an alpha-sprayer." 

"Thanks," said Baley sadly, 
"but you're a robot. Your testimony will be invalid." 

"The Commissioner is your 
friend. He will listen. He will 
have to listen." 

"The Commissioner has a job 
to keep, and he's already a bit 
uneasy about me. There's only 
one chance of saving myself from 
this very nasty situation." 

"Yes?" 

"T ASK myself, why am I being framed? Obviously, to 
get rid of me. But why? Again, 
obviously, because I am dangerous to someone. I am doing my 
best to be dangerous to whoever 

139 



killed Dr. Sarton in Spacetown. 
That might mean the Medievalists, of course, or at least the 
inner group among them. It 
would be this inner group that 
would know I passed through 
the power plant. One or more of 
them might have followed us 
along the strips that far, even 
though you thought we had lost 
them. 

"So the chances are that, if I 
find the murderer of Dr. Sarton, 
I find the man or men trying to 
get me out of the way. If I 
think it through — if I crack the 
case — I'll be safe. And Jessie. I 
couldn't stand to have her . . . 
But I don't have much time." 

Baley looked at R. Daneel 
with sudden burning hope. Whatever the creature was, he was 
strong and faithful, inspired by 
no selfishness. What more could 
you ask of any friend? Baley 
needed a friend, and he was in 
no mood to cavil at the fact that 
a gear replaced a blood-vessel 
in this particular one. 

"You and I," he said. "You 
and I, Daneel. We'll get it out of 
Clousarr. You can use your cerebroanalysis, squeeze the most out 
of it, make it . . ." 

He stopped in astonishment. 
R. Daneel was shaking his head. 

The robot said, "I am sorry, 
Elijah — " there was no trace of 
sorrow on his face, of course — 
"but I anticipated none of this. 



Perhaps my action was to your 
harm. I am sorry if the general 
good requires that." 

"What general good?" stammered Baley. 

"I have been in communication 
with Dr. Fastolfe." 

"Jehoshaphat! When?" 

"While you were eating. I possess the capacity for sub-etheric 
communication with Spacetown. 
It was thought wise to install a 
self-contained circuit for the purpose within me. I've used it before." 

Baley's Hps tightened. Was he 
never to finish learning of new 
potentialities within the lump of 
metal and plastic that faced him 
now? 

"Well?" he managed to say. 
"What happened?" 

"You will have to clear yourself of suspicion of the murder of 
R. Sammy through some means 
other than the investigation of 
the murder of my designer, Dr. 
Sarton. Our people at Spacetown, 
as a result of my information, 
have decided to bring that investigation to an end, as of today, 
and to begin plans for leaving 
Spacetown and Earth." 

CHAPTER XVII 

TJALEY looked at his watch 
with something close to detachment. It was 21:45. In two 
and a quarter hours, it would be 



MO 




 



midnight. He had been awake 
since before six and had been 
under tension now for more than 
two days. 

"What's it all about, Daneel?" 
he asked. 

R. Daneel said, "Is it not obvious?" 

"It is not a damn bit obvious." 

"We are here," said the robot, 
"to break down the isolationism 
of Earth and force its people into 
new expansion and colonization." 

"I know that." 

"If we were anxious to exact 
punishment for the murder of 
Dr. Sarton, it was not that in doing so we expected to bring Dr. 
Sarton back to life. It was only 
that failure to do so would 
strengthen the position of our 
home-planet politicians, who are 
against the very idea of Spacetown." 

"But now," said Baley, with 
sudden violence, "you say you're 
getting ready to go home of your 
own accord. Why? The answer to 
the Sarton case is close. It must 
be close or they wouldn't be trying so hard to blast me out of 
the investigation. I have a feeling I have all the facts I need to 
work out the answer." 

Baley drew a shuddering 
breath. He was making a spectacle of himself before a machine 
that could only stare at him silently. 

He said harshly, "Well, never 



mind that. Why are the Spacers 
breaking off?" 

"Our project is concluded. We 
are satisfied that Earth will colonize." 

"You've switched to optimism?" 

"For a long time now, we of 
Spacetown have tried to change 
Earth by changing its economy. 
We have tried to introduce our 
own C/Fe culture — the carbon 
and iron of a human-plus-robot 
society. Your planetary and various City government cooperated 
with us because it was expedient 
to do so. Still, for twenty-five 
years, we had consistently failed. 
The harder we tried, the stronger i 
the opposing party of the Medievalists grew." 

"I know all this," said Baley. 
"Get to the point." 

F> DANEEL went on, "It was 
Dr. Sarton who argued that 
we must reverse our tactics. We 
must first find a segment of 
Earth's population that desired 
what we desired or could be persuaded to do so. By encouraging 
and helping them, we could make 
the movement a native rather 
than an alien one. The difficulty 
was in finding the native element 
best suited for our purposes. You 
yourself, Elijah, were an interesting experiment." 

"I? What do you mean?" demanded Baley. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



141 



"We were glad your Commissioner recommended you. From 
your psychic profile, we judged 
you to be a useful specimen. Cerebroanalysis confirmed our judgment. You are a practical man, 
Elijah. You do not moon romantically over Earth's past, despite your healthy interest in it. 
Nor do you blindly accept the 
City culture of the present. We 
felt that it was people such as 
yourself who could lead Earthmen to the stars once more. It 
was one reason Dr. Fastolfe was 
anxious to see you yesterday 
morning. 

"To be sure, your practical 
nature was embarrassingly intense. You refused to understand 
that the fanatical service of an 
ideal, even a mistaken ideal, may 
make a man do things quite beyond his ordinary capacity, as, 
for instance, crossing open country at night to destroy someone 
he considers an arch-enemy of 
his cause. We were not overly surprised, therefore, that you were 
stubborn and daring enough to 
attempt to prove the murder a 
fraud. In a way, it showed you 
were the man we wanted for our 
experiment." 

"For God's sake, what experiment?" 

"The experiment of persuading you that colonization was the 
answer to Earth's problems." R. 
Daneel spoke quietly. 



"Well, I was persuaded." 

"Yes, under the influence of 
the appropriate drug." 

Baley almost dropped the pipe 
he was carefully filling with precious rationed tobacco. Once 
again, he was seeing that scene 
in the Spacetown dome — himself 
swimming back to awareness 
after the shock of learning that 
R. Daneel was a robot, after all 
— R. Daneel' s smooth fingers 
pinching up the flesh of his arm 
— a hypo-sliver standing out 
darkly under his skin and then 
fading away. 

He said chokingly, "What was 
in the hypo-sliver?" 

"Nothing that need alarm you, 
Elijah. It was a mild drug intended only to make your mind 
more receptive." 

"And so I believed whatever 
was told me. Is that it?" He asked 
unevenly. 

"Not quite. You would not believe anything that was foreign 
to your basic thought pattern. In 
fact, the results of the experiment 
were disappointing. Dr. Fastolfe 
had hoped you would become 
fanatical on the subject. Instead, 
you became rather distantly approving and no more. Your practical nature stood in the way. It 
made us realize that our only 
hope was the romantics. And the 
romantics, unfortunately, were 
all Medievalists, actual or potential." 



142 




 



T> ALEY felt irrationally proud 
of himself, glad of his stubbornness and happy that he had 
disappointed them. Let them experiment with someone else. 

He grinned. "So now you've 
given up. You're going home." 

"No," R. Daneel answered. "I 
said a few moments ago that we 
were satisfied Earth would colonize. It was you who gave us the 
answer." 

"/ gave it to you? How?" 

"You spoke to Francis Clousarr concerning colonization. At 
least our experiment on you had 
that result. And Clousarr's aura 
changed." 

"You mean I convinced him I 
was right. Nonsense!" 

"Conviction does not come 
that easily. But the cerebric 
changes demonstrated conclusively that the Medievalist mind 
is open to that sort of conviction. 
The phenomenon called Medievalism is a frustrated wish to 
pioneer. To be sure, the direction 
in which that wish is directed at 
present is toward Earth. But the 
vision of distant worlds is a similar magnet and the romantic can 
turn to it easily. Clousarr felt the 
attraction as a result of a single 
lecture from you. 

"So, you see, we of Spacetown 
had already succeeded without 
knowing it. We ourselves, rather 
than anything we tried to introduce, were the unsettling factor. 



We crystallized the romantic impulses on Earth into Medievalism, 
and induced an organization. 
After all, it is the Medievalist 
who wishes to break the chains 
of custom, not the City officials 
who have most to gain from preserving the status quo. 

"If we leave behind a few obscure individuals or robots such 
as myself, who, together with 
sympathetic Earthmen such as 
yourself, can establish the training schools for emigrants that I 
spoke of, the Medievalist will 
eventually turn away from Earth. 
He will need robots and either 
get them from us or build his 
own. He will develop a C/Fe 
culture to suit himself." 

It was a long speech for R. 
Daneel. He must have realized 
that himself, for he added, * "I 
tell you all this to explain why it 
is necessary to do something that 
may hurt you." 

T IJE BALKY said, "Just a 
minute. Let me introduce a 
practical note. You'll go back to 
your worlds and say that an 
Earthman killed a Spacer and 
went unpunished. The Outer 
Worlds will demand an indemnity from Earth and Earth is no 
longer in a mood to give in to 
Spacer threats. There will be 
trouble." 

"I am sure that will not happen, Elijah. The elements on our 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



143 



planet most interested in pressing 
for an indemnity would also be 
most interested in forcing an end 
to Spacetown. We can easily 
offer the latter as an inducement 
to abandon the former. It is 
what we plan to do. Earth will be 
left in peace." 

Baley broke out, his voice 
hoarse with sudden despair, "And 
where does that leave me? The 
Commissioner will drop the Sarton investigation at once if 
Spacetown is willing, but the R. 
Sammy thing will have to continue hecause it points to conspiracy inside the Department. 
He'll be in any minute with a 
ream of evidence against me. I 
know that. It's been arranged. 
I'll be declassified, Daneel. 
There's Jessie to consider. 
There's Bentley — " 

R. Daneel said, "In the service 
of humanity's good, minor wrongs 
to individuals must be tolerated. 
Dr. Sarton has a surviving wife, 
two children, parents, a sister, 
many friends. All must grieve at 
his death and be saddened at the 
thought that his murderer has 
not been found and punished." 

"Then why not stay and find 
him?" 

"It is no longer necessary." 

Baley said bitterly, "Why not 
admit that the entire investigation was an excuse to study us 
under field conditions? You never 
cared who killed Dr. Sarton." 



"We would have liked to 
know," said R. Daneel coolly, 
"but we were never under any 
delusions as to which was more 
important, an individual or 
humanity. To continue the investigation would involve interfering with a situation which we 
now find satisfactory." 

"You mean the murderer might 
turn out to be a prominent Medievalist, and right now the 
Spacers don't want to do anything to antagonize their new 
friends." 

"It is not as I would say it. 
but there is truth in" your words." 
Daneel sounded faintly troubled. 

"Where's your justice circuit, 
Daneel? Is this justice?" 

"There are degrees of justice, 
Elijah. When the lesser is incompatible with the greater, the lesser must give way." 

It was as though Baley's mind 
were circling the impregnable 
logic of R. Daneel's positronic 
brain, searching for a loophole, a 
weakness. 

ITE said, "Have you no personal curiosity, Daneel? 
You've called yourself a detective. Do you know what that implies?" 

Baley's hopes, not strong in 
the first place, weakened as he 
spoke. The word "curiosity" 
brought back his own remarks to 
Francis Clousarr four hours be

fore. He had known well enough 
then the qualities that marked off 
a man from a machine. Curiosity 
had to be one of them. 

R. Daneel echoed his thoughts 
by asking, "What do you mean 
by curiosity?" 

Baley sighed. "Curiosity is the 
name we give to a desire to extend one's knowledge." 

"Such a desire exists within 
me, when the extension of knowledge is necessary for the performance of an assigned task." 

"Yes," said Baley sarcastically, 
"like when you ask questions 
about Bentley's contact lenses 
in order to learn more of Earth's 
customs." 

"Precisely," R. Daneel agreed, 
with no sign of any awareness of 
sarcasm. "Aimless extension of 
knowledge, however, which is 
what I think you really mean by 
the term curiosity, is merely inefficiency. I am designed to avoid 
inefficiency." 

While R. Daneel spoke. Baley's 
mouth opened and stayed so. 
Somewhere, deep inside his unconscious, he had built a case, 
built it carefully and in detail, but 
had been brought up short by a 
single impossibility. One impossibility that could be neither 
jumped over, burrowed under 
nor shunted aside. 

But the inconsistency had vanished — the case was all in his 
hands — at last. 



T'HE glare of mental light appeared to have stimulated 
Baley mightily. At least, he suddenly knew what R. Daneel's 
weakness must be, the weakness 
of any thinking machine. The 
thing must be literal-minded. 

He said, "Then Project Spacetown is concluded as of today 
and with it the Sarton investigation. Is that it?" 

"That is the decision of our 
people at Spacetown," agreed R. 
Daneel. 

"But today is not , yet over." 
Baley looked at his watch. "There 
is an hour and a half until midnight Let's go on as before. It 
will do your people no harm. In 
fact, it will do them great good. 
My word upon it. It is only an 
hour and a half I ask." 

R. Daneel said, "What you say 
is correct. Today is not over. I 
had not thought of that, partner 
Elijah." 

Baley was "partner Elijah" 
again. He felt his muscles relax. 

He said, "Dr. Fastolfe spoke 
of a film of the scene of the murder when I was in Spacetown 
yesterday." 

"Yes. At the time, you were not 
interested." 

"At the time, I wasn't myself. 
It's different now. Can you get 
a copy of the film?" 

"Yes, partner Elijah." 

"I mean now — instantly!" 

"In ten minutes, if I can use 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



145 



the Department transmitter." 

The process took less than that. 
Baley stared at the small aluminum block he held in his trembling hands. Within it, the subtle 
forces transmitted from Spacetown had strongly fixed a certain 
atomic pattern. 

And at that moment, Commissioner Julius Enderby stood in 
the doorway. He saw Baley and 
anxiety passed from his round 
face, leaving behind it a look of 
growing thunder. 

He said, "Look here, Lije, 
you're taking a devil of a time 
eating." 

"I was bone-tired, Commissioner. Sorry if I've delayed you." 

"I wouldn't mind, only — you'd 
better come to my office.' 

Baley's eyes flicked toward R. 
Daneel, but met no answering 
look. He followed Enderby out. 

JULIUS ENDERBY nervously, 
tramped the floor before his 
desk. Baley watched him, himself far from composed. Occasionally, he glanced at his watch. 
It was 22:45. 

The Commissioner moved his 
glasses up onto his forehead and 
rubbed his eyes with thumb and 
forefinger. "Lije," he said suddenly, "when were you last in 
the Williamsburg power plant?" 

Baley said, "Yesterday, after 
I left the office. About 1800 or 
shortly thereafter/' 



The Commissioner shook his 
head. "Why didn't you say so 
sooner, Lije?" 

"I was going to. I haven't 
given an official statement yet." 

"What were you doing there?" 

"Just passing through, on our 
way to my temporary sleeping 
quarters." 

The Commissioner stopped 
short, stood before Baley and 
said, "That's no good, Lije. No 
one just passes through a power 
plant to get somewhere else." 

Baley shrugged. There was no 
point in going through the story 
of the pursuing Medievalists, of 
the dash along the strips. Not 
now. 

He said, "If you're trying to 
hint that I had an opportunity 
to get the alpha-sprayer that 
knocked out R. Sammy, Daneel 
was with me and will testify I 
went right through the plant 
without stopping." 

Slowly, the Commissioner sat 
down. He did not look in R. 
Daneel's direction or offer - to 
speak to him. "Lije, I don't know 
what to say or what to think. 
And it's no use having your — 
your partner as alibi. He can't 
give evidence." 

"I still deny that I took an 
alpha-sprayer." 

The Commissioner's fingers 
intertwined. He said, "Why did 
Jessie come to see you here this 
afternoon?" 



146 




 



"You asked me that before 
Commissioner. Same answer. 
Family matters." 

"I've got information from 
Francis Clousarr, Lije." 

"What kind of information?" 

"He claims that a Jezebel 
Baley is a member of a Medievalist society dedicated to the 
overthrow of the government by 
force." 

"Are you sure he has the right 
person? There are many Baleys." 

"There aren't many Jezebel 
Baleys." 

"He said Jezebel?" 

"I heard him, Lije." 

" A LL right," Baley said. "Jessie was a member of a 
harmless lunatic-fringe organization. She never did anything but 
attend meetings and feel devilish 
about it." 

"It won't look that way to a 
board of review, Lije." 

"You mean I'm going to be 
suspended and held on suspicion 
of destroying government property in the form of R. Sammy?" 

"I hope not, Lije, but it looks 
bad. Everyone knows you didn't 
like R. Sammy. Your wife was 
seen talking to him this afternoon. She was in tears and some 
of her words were heard. They 
were harmless in themselves, but 
two and two can be added up, 
Lije. And you had an opportunity to obtain the weapon." 



Baley interrupted. "If I were 
wiping out all evidence against 
Jessie, would I arrest Francis 
Clousarr? He seems to know a 
lot more about her than R. Sammy could have. Another thing. 
I passed through the power plant 
eighteen hours before R. Sammy 
spoke to Jessie. Did I know, that 
long in advance, I would have to 
destroy him, and pick up an 
alpha-sprayer by pure clairvoyance?" 

The Commissioner said, "Those 
are good objections. I'll do my 
best." 

"Yes? Do you really believe I 
didn't do it, Commissioner?" 

Enderby said slowly, "I don't 
know what to think." 

"Then I'll tell you. Commissioner, this is all a careful and 
elaborate frame." 

"Now wait, Lije! Don't strike 
out blindly. You won't get any 
sympathy with that line of defense." 

"I'm not after sympathy. I'm 
just telling the truth. I'm being 
taken out of circulation to prevent me from learning the facts 
about the Sarton murder. Unfortunately for my framing pal, 
it's too late for that." 

"What!" 

Baley looked at his watch. It 
was 23:00. 

He said, "I know who is framing me and I know how Dr. Sarton was killed and by whom, and 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



147 



I have one hour to tell you about 
it, catch the man and end the 
investigation." 

CHAPTER XVIII 

^COMMISSIONER * Enderby's 
eyes narrowed and he glared 
at Baley. "You tried something 
like this in Spacetown yesterday morning. Not again." 

Baley nodded. "I know. I was 
wrong the first time." 

He thought fiercely: Also the 
second time. But not now! 

He said, "Judge for yourself, 
Commissioner. Grant that the 
evidence against me has been 
planted. Go that far with me and 
see where it takes you. Ask yourself who could have planted that 
evidence. Obviously, only someone who knew I was in the 
Williamsburg plant yesterday 
evening." 

"All right — who?" asked 
Enderby. 

"I was followed out of the 
kitchen by a .Medievalist group. 
I lost them, or I thought I did, 
but obviously at least one of them 
saw me pass through the plant. 
My only purpose in going 
through was to lose them." 

The Commissioner considered. 
"Clousarr? Was he with them?" 

Baley nodded. 

Enderby said, "All right, we'll 
question him." 

"Don't stop there, Commis


sioner. Ke.ep thinking." 

"Clousarr saw you go into the 
Williamsburg power plant, or 
else someone in his group did 
and passed the information along 
to him. He decided to utilize that 
fact to get you into trouble and 
off the investigation. Is that what 
you're saying?" 

"It's close." 

"Good." The Commissioner 
seemed to warm to the task. "He 
knew your wife was a member of 
his organization, naturally, and 
so he knew you wouldn't face a 
really close probe into your private life. He thought you would 
resign rather than fight circumstantial evidence. By the way, 
Lije, what about a resignation?" 

"Not in a million years, Commissioner." 

Enderby shrugged. "Well, so 
he got an alpha-sprayer, presumably through a confederate 
in the plant, and had another 
confederate arrange the destruction of R. Sammy." His fingers 
drummed lightly on the desk. 
"No good, Lije." 

"Why not?" 

' "Too far-fetched. Too many 
confederates. And he has a castiron alibi for the night and morning of the Spacetown murder. We 
checked that almost right away." 

"I never said it was Clousarr, 
Commissioner. You did. It could 
be anyone in the Medievalist organisation. Clousarr is just the 




 



owner of a face that Daneel happened to recognize. Though there 
is one queer thing about him." 

"What?" . asked Enderby. 

"He did know Jessie was a 
member. Does he know every 
member in the organization, do 
you suppose?" 

"I have no idea. He knew about 
Jessie, anyway. Maybe she was 
important because she was the 
wife of a policeman." 

"He came right out and said 
Jezebel Baley was a member — 
just like that? Jezebel Baley?" 

piNDERBY nodded. "I heard 
■"-^ him myself, Lije." 

"That's the funny thing. Commissioner," said Baley. "Jessie 
hasn't used her full first name 
since before Bentley was born. 
Not once. I know that for a fact. 
She joined the Medievalists after 
she dropped her full name. How 
would Clousarr know her as Jezebel then?" 

The Commissioner said, "Oh? 
Well, he probably said Jessie. I 
guess I just filled it in automatically — " 

"Until now you were quite 
sure he said Jezebel. I asked several times." 

The Commissioner's voice rose. 
"You're not saying I'm a liar, are 
you?" 

"I'm just wondering if Clousarr said nothing at all. You've 
known Jessie for twenty years 



and you knew her name was 
Jezebel." 

"You're off your head, man." 

"Am I? Where were you after 
lunch today? You were out of 
your office for two hours, at 
least." 

"Are you questioning me?" 

"I'll answer for you, too. You 
were in the Williamsburg power 
plant." 

The Commissioner jumped up 
from his seat. His forehead glistened. "What the hell are you 
trying to say?" 

"Weren't you?" 

"Baley, you're suspended. Hand 
me your credentials." 

"Not till you hear me out." 

"I don't intend to. You're 
guilty. What gets me is your 
cheap attempt to make me. look 
as though I were conspiring 
against you. In fact, you're under arrest." 

"No," said Baley. "Not yet. 
Commissioner. I've got a blaster 
on you. Don't fool with me. 
please, because I intend to have 
my say. Afterward, you can do 
what you please." 

With widening eyes, Julius Enderby stammered, "Twenty years 
for this, Baley, in the deepest 
prison level in the City." 

For the first time since R. 
Daneel had entered the City, the 
Commissioner spoke directly to 
the robot. "Hold him, you. First 
Law!" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



149 



RDANEEL moved sudden• ly. His hand clamped down 
on Baley's wrist. He said quietly,, 
"I cannot permit this, partner 
Elijah. You must do no harm to 
the Commissioner." 

"I have no intention of hurting him, Daneel. You said you 
would help me clear this up. I 
have 45 minutes." 

R. Daneel, without releasing 
Baley's wrist, said, "Commissioner, I believe Elijah should be 
allowed to speak. I am in communication with Dr. Fastolfe at 
this moment." 

"How? How?" demanded the 
Commissioner wildly. 

"Self-contained sub-etheric 
unit," explained Baley. "He's a 
great little model of a robot, 
Commissioner." 

"I am in communication with 
Dr. Fastolfe," the robot went on 
inexorably, "and it would make 
a bad impression, Commissioner, 
if you were to refuse to listen to 
Elijah. Damaging inferences 
might be drawn." 

The Commissioner fell back 
in his chair. 

"I say you were in the Williamsburg power plant today, 
Commissioner," Baley said. "You 
got the alpha-sprayer and gave 
it to R. Sammy. You deliberately chose the Williamsburg power 
plant in order to incriminate me. 
You even seized on Dr. Gerrigel's 
reappearance to invite him down 



to the Department and give him 
a deliberately maladjusted guiderod to lead him to the photographic supply room and. allow 
him to find R. Sammy's remains. 
You counted on him to make a 
correct diagnosis." 

Baley put away his blaster. "If 
you want to have me arrested 
now, go ahead, but Spacetown 
won't take that for an answer." 

"Motive," spluttered Enderby 
breathlessly. His glasses were 
fogged and he removed them, 
looking once again curiously 
vague and helpless in their absence. "What motive could I have 
for this?" 

"You got me into trouble, 
didn't you? It will put a spoke 
in the Sarton investigation, won't 
it? And all that aside, R. Sammy 
knew too much." 

"About what, in Heaven's 
name?" 

"About the way in which a 
Spacer was murdered five and a 
half days ago. You see, Commissioner, you murdered Dr. Sarton 
of Spacetown." 




'OMMISSIONER Enderby 
1 shook his head violently. 



R. Daneel said, "Partner Elijah, you know it is impossible 
for Commissioner Enderby to 
have murdered Dr. Sarton." 

"Listen. Enderby begged me to 
take the case. Why? In the first 
place, we were college friends and 



150 




 



he thought he could count on my 
loyalty-index. Secondly, he knew 
Jessie was a member of an underground organization and he 
counted on blackmailing me into 
silence if I g<^ too close to the 
truth. But he wasn't really worried about that. At the very beginning, he did his best to arouse 
my distrust of you, Daneel, to 
make certain the two of us worked at cross -purposes. He knew 
about my father's declassification. He could guess how I would 
react." 

The Commissioner said weakly, "How could I know about 
Jessie?" He turned to* the robot. 
"You — if you're transmitting this 
to Spacetown — tell them it's a 
lie!" 

Baley broke in, "Certainly you 
would know about Jessie. You're 
a Medievalist and part of the 
organization. Your old-fashioned 
spectacles! Your windows! It's 
obvious. 

"And there's better evidence. 
How did Jessie find out Daneel 
was a robot? Through her Medievalist organization, of course. 
But that just shoves the problem 
one step backward. How did 
they know? 

"You, Commissioner, dismissed it with a theory that Daneel 
was recognized as a robot during 
the incident at the shoe counter. 
I couldn't believe that. I took 
him for human when I first saw 

THE CAVES OF STEEL 



him, and there's nothing wrong 
with my eyes. 

"Yesterday, I asked Dr. Gerrigel to come in from Washington. At the time, my only 
purpose was to see if he would 
recognize Daneel for what he was, 
with no prompting on my part. 
Commissioner, he didn't! I introduced him to Daneel, he shook 
hands with him, we all talked 
together and it was only after 
the subject got around to humanoid robots that he suddenly 
caught on. Now that was Dr. Gerrigel, Earth's greatest expert on 
robots. Do you mean to say a few 
Medievalist rioters could do better? 

"It's obvious now that the 
Medievalists must have known 
Daneel was a robot to begin with. 
The incident at the shoe counter 
was deliberately arranged to show 
Daneel and, through him, Spacetown, the extent of anti- robot 
feeling in the City. It was meant 
to confuse the issue. 

"Now if they knew the truth 
about Daneel to begin with, who 
told them? I didn't. I once 
thought it was Daneel himself, 
but that's out. The only other 
Earthman who knew about it was 
you, Commissioner." 

"I^NDERBY said, "There could 
be spies in the Department, 
too. The Medievalists could have 
us riddled with them. Your wife 

151 



was one, and if you don't find it 
impossible that I should be one, 
why not others in the Department?" 

Baley shook his head. "Let's 
not bring up mysterious spies 
until we see where the straightforward solution leads us. 

"It's interesting, now that I 
look back on it, Commissioner, 
to see how your spirits rose and 
fell in direct ratio with my nearness to the solution. When I 
wanted to visit Spacetown yesterday morning and wouldn't tell 
you the reason, you were in a 
state of agitation. Did you think 
I had you pinned, Commissioner? 

"Then when I came out with 
my completely wrong solution 
and you saw how immensely far 
from the truth I was, you were 
confident again, you even argued 
with me — defended the Spacers. 
After that, you were master of 
yourself for a while — quite confident. 

"Then I put in my call for Dr. 
Gerrigel, and you wanted to know 
why, and I wouldn't tell you. 
That plunged you into the abyss 
again, because you feared — " 

R. Daneel suddenly raised his 
hand. "Partner Elijah!" 

• Baley looked at his watch — 
23:42! He said, "What is it?" 

R. Daneel said, "He might have 
been disturbed at thinking you 
would find out his Medievalist 
connections, if we grant their ex
152 



istence. There is nothing, though, 
to connect him with the murder." 

Baley said, "You're wrong, Daneel. He didn't know what I 
wanted Dr. Gerrigel for, but it 
was safe to assume that it was 
for information about robots. 
This frightened the Commissioner, because a robot had an intimate connection with his greater 
crime. Isn't that so, Commissioner?" 

Enderby raised his head and 
glowered. "When this is over — " 
he began. 

"How was the murder committed?" interrupted Baley with 
a suppressed fury. "C/Fe! I use 
your own term, Daneel. You're 
so full of the benefits of a C/Fe 
culture, yet you don't see where 
an Earthman might have used it 
for at least a temporary advantage. Let me sketch it in for you. 

"There is no inconsistency in 
the notion of a robot crossing 
open country. Even at night. 
Even alone. The Commissioner 
put a blaster into R. Sammy's 
hand, told him where to go and 
when. He himself entered Spacetown through the Personal and 
was relieved of his own blaster. 
He t received the other from R. 
Sammy's hands, killed Dr. Sarton, returned the blaster to R. 
Sammy, who took it back across 
the fields to New York City. And 
today he destroyed R. Sammy, 
who had become dangerous. 


 



l 



"That explains the whole thing. 
The presence of the Commissioner, the absence of a weapon. 
And it makes it unnecessary to 
suppose any human New Yorker 
had walked a mile under the 
open sky alone at night." 

A T the end of Baley's accusation, R. Daneel said, "I am 
sorry, partner Elijah, though 
happy for the Commissioner, that 
your story explains nothing. 1 
have told you that the cerebroanalysis of the Commissioner 
proves that it is impossible for 
him to have committed deliberate murder." 

"Thank you," muttered Enderby. His voice gained strength 
and confidence. "I don't know 
what your motives are, Baley, 
or why you should try to ruin me 
this way, but — " 

"Wait," said Baley. "I'm not 
through. I've got this." 

He slammed the aluminum 
cube on Enderby's desk, tried to 
feel the confidence he hoped he 
was radiating. For half an hour, 
he had been hiding from himself 
one disturbing fact — that he did 
not know what the picture showed. He was gambling, but it was 
all he could do now. 

Enderby shrank away from the 
small object. "What is it?" 

"It isn't a bomb," said Baley 
sardonically. "Just an ordinary 
micro-projector." 



"Well? What will it prove?" 
the Commissioner asked. 

"Suppose We see." His fingernail probed at one of the slits in 
the cube, and a corner of the 
Commissioner's office blanked 
out, then lit up in an alien scene 
in three dimensions. It reached 
from floor to ceiling and extended out past the walls of the room. 
It was awash with a gray light 
of a sort the City's utilities never 
provided. 

Baley thought, with a pang of 
mingled distaste and perverse 
attraction: It must be this "dawn" 
they talk about. 

The pictured scene was of Dr. 
Sarton's dome. Dr. Sarton's dead 
body, a horrible, broken remnant, 
filled its center. Enderby's eyes 
bulged as he stared. 

Baley said, "I know the Commissioner isn't a killer. I don't 
need you to tell me that, Daneel. 
If I could have gotten around 
that one fact earlier, I would 
have had the solution earlier. Actually, I didn't see a way out of 
it until an hour ago, when I angrily reminded you that you had 
once been curious about Bentley's contact lenses. 

"That was it, Commissioner. It 
occurred to me then that your 
near-sightedness and your glasses were the key. They don't have 
near-sightedness on the Outer 
Worlds, I suppose, or they might 
have reached the true solution of 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



153 



the murder almost at once. Commissioner, when did you break 
your glasses?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"When I first saw you about 
this case," Baley said, "you told 
me you had broken your glasses 
in Spacetown. I assumed that 
you broke them in your agitation 
on hearing the news of the murder, but you never said so. Actually, if you were entering Spacetown with crime on your mind, 
you were already agitated enough 
to drop and break your glasses 
before the murder. Isn't that so?" 

R. Daneel said, "I do not see 
the point, partner Elijah." 

T> ALEY was manipulating Sarton's dome-image as he was 
speaking. Clumsily, he expanded 
it, his fingernails unsure in the 
tension that was overwhelming 
him. Slowly, the corpse widened, broadened, heightened, came 
closer. Baley could almost smell 
the stench of scorched flesh. 

Baley cast a side-glance at the 
Commissioner. Enderby had closed his eyes. He looked sick. Baley felt sick, too, but he had" to 
look. Slowly he circled the trimensional image by means of the 
transmitter controls — rotating it, 
bringing the ground about the 
corpse into view in successive 
quadrants. 

He was still talking. He had to. 
He couldn't stop till he found 



what he was looking for. He said, 
"The Commissioner can't commit deliberate murder. True! But 
any man can kill by accidenr. 
The Commissioner didn't enter 
Spacetown to kill Dr. Sarton. He 
came in to kill you, Daneel. You! 

"He is a Medievalist, an earnest one. He cooperated with Dr. 
Sarton and knew the purpose for 
which you were designed, Daneel. 
He feared that purpose might be 
achieved, that Earthmen would 
eventually be weaned away from 
Earth. So he decided to destroy 
you, Daneel. You were the only 
one of your type manufactured 
as yet, and he had good reason to 
think that, by demonstrating the 
extent and determination of Medievalism on Earth, he would discourage the Spacers. 

"I don't say even the thought 
of killing you, Daneel, was a 
pleasant one. He would have had 
R. Sammy do it, I imagine, if 
you didn't look so human that a 
primitive rpbot like Sammy could 
not have told the difference, or 
understood it. First Law would 
stop him. Or the Commissioner 
would have had another human 
do it if he himself were not the 
only one who had ready access 
to Spacetown at all times. 

"Let me reconstruct what the 
Commissioner's plan might have 
been. He made the appointment 
with Dr. Sarton, but deliberately 
came early — at dawn, in fact. Dr. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



155 



Sarton would be sleeping, but 
you, Daneel, would be awake. I 
assume, by the way, you were 
living with Dr. Sarton, Daneel?" 

rTlHE robot nodded. "You are 
quite right, partner Elijah." 

Baley said, "You would come 
to the Dome door, Daneel, receive 
a blaster charge in the chest or 
head and be done with. The 
Commissioner would leave quickly, through the deserted streets of 
Spacetown's dawn, and back to 
where R. Sammy waited. He 
would give the robot back the 
blaster, then slowly walk again 
to Dr. Sarton's Dome. If necessary, he would 'discover' the body 
himself. How close am I,' Commissioner?" 

Enderby writhed. "I didn't — " 

"No," said Baley, "you didn't 
kill Daneel. He's here, and in all 
the time he's been in the City, 
you haven't been able to look 
him in the face or address him by 
name. Look at him now, Commissioner:*' 

Enderby couldn't. He covered 
his face with shaking hands. 

"I'll tell you what did happen," went on Baley inexorably. 
"You were at the Dome when 
you dropped your glasses. You 
must have been nervous. I've seen 
you when you're upset. You take 
the glasses off, wipe them — you 
did that then. But your hands 
were shaking and you dropped 



them. Perhaps you stepped on 
them. Anyway, they were broken 
and, just then, the door opened 
and a figure that looked like Daneel faced you. 

"You blasted him, scrabbled 
up the remains of your glasses 
and ran. They found the body, 
not you, and when they came to 
find you, you discovered that it 
was not Daneel but the earlyrising Dr. Sarton you had killed. 
Dr. Sarton had designed Daneel 
in his own image, to his great 
misfortune. If you want the tangible proof, it's there!" 

The image of Sarton's Dome 
quivered and Baley put the transmitter carefully upon the desk, 
his hand tightly upon it. 

Commissioner Enderby's face 
was distorted with terror and Baley's with tension. R. Daneel, as 
always, was emotionless. 

Baley's finger was pointing. 
"That glitter in the grooves of 
the door. What was it, Daneel?" 

"Two small slivers of glass," 
said the robot coolly. "It meant 
nothing to us." 

"It will now. They're bits of 
concave lenses. Measure them 
and compare the results with 
those of the glasses Enderby is 
wearing now. Don't smash them, 
Commissioner I" 

He lunged and wrenched them 
from the Commissioner's hand. 
He held them out to R. Daneel. 
"That's proof enough, I think, 
that he was at the Dome earlier 
than he was thought to be." 

R. Daneel said, "I am quite 
convinced. I can see now that I 
was thrown completely off the 
scent by the Commissioner's cerebroanalysis. I congratulate you, 
partner Elijah." 

Baley's watch said 24:00. A 
new day was beginning. 

SLOWLY, the Commissioner's 
head sank down on his arms. 
His words were muffled wails. 
"It was a mistake. I never meant 
to kill him." Without warning, 
he slipped from the chair and lay 
crumpled on the floor. 

R. Daneel sprang to him, saying, "You have hurt him, Elijah!" 



"He isn't dead, is he?" 

"No. Unconscious." 

"He'll come to. It was too much 
for him, I suppose. I had to do 
it, Daneel. I had no evidence that 
would stand up in court — only 
inferences. I had to badger him 
and let it out little by little, hoping he would break down. He 
did, Daneel. You heard him confess, didn't you?" 

"Yes." 

"Now, then, I promised this 
would be to the benefit of Space town's project, so . . . Wait, he's 
coming to." 

The Commissioner groaned. 
He stared speechlessly at them. 

Baley said, "Commissioner, do 
you hear me?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



157 



The Commissioner nodded 
listlessly. 

"All right, then. The Spacers 
have more on their minds than 
your prosecution. If you cooperate with them — " 

"What? What?" There was a 
dawning flicker of hope in the 
Commissioner's eyes. 

"You must be a big wheel in 
New York's Medievalist organization, maybe even in the planetary setup. Maneuver them 
toward the colonization of space. 
You can see the propaganda line, 
can't you? We can go back to 
the soil, all right — but on other 
planets." 

"I don't understand," mumbled 
the Commissioner. 

R. Daneel said, "Elijah is quite 
correct. Help us, Commissioner, 
and we will forget the past. I am 
speaking for Dr. Fastolfe and our 
people generally in this. Of 
course, if you should agree to 
help and later betray us, we 
would always have the fact of 
your guilt to hold over your head. 
I hope you understand that, too. 
It pains me to have to mention it," 

"I won't be prosecuted?" asked 
the Commissioner. 

"Not if you help us." 

Tears filled his eyes. "I'll do it. 
It was an accident. Explain that 
— an accident. I did what I 
thought right." 

Baley said, "If you help us, 
you will be doing right. The col


onization of space is the only 
possible salvation of Earth. You'll 
realize that if you think about it 
without prejudice. If you find 
you cannot, have a short talk 
with Dr. Fastolfe. And now you 
can begin to help by quashing 
the R. Sammy business. Call this 
one an accident also. End it!" 

T>ALEY got to his feet. He 
added, "And remember, I'm 
not the only one who knows the 
truth, Commissioner. Getting rid 
of me will ruin you. All Spacetown knows. You see that, don't 
you?" 

R. Daneel said, "It is unnecessary to say more, Elijah. He is 
sincere. He will help. So much 
is obvious from his cerebroanalysis." 

"Then I can go home. I want 
to see Jessie and Bentley and 
take up a natural life again. And 
I want to sleep. Daneel, will you 
stay on Earth after the Spacers 
go?" 

R. Daneel said, "I may, along 
with others. It has not been decided. Why do you ask?" 

Baley bit his lip. "I didn't 
think I would ever say anything 
like this to anyone like you, Daneel, but I trust you. I even — 
admire you. I'm too old ever to 
leave Earth myself, but when 
schools for emigrants are finally 
established, there's Bentley. If 
someday Bentley and you, to

gether might be able to . . ." 

"Perhaps." R. Daneel's face 
was emotionless. 

He turned to Julius Enderby, 
who was watching them with a 
flaccid face into which a certain 
vitality was only now beginning 
to* return. 

The robot said, "I have been 
trying, friend Julius, to understand some remarks Elijah made 
to me earlier. Perhaps I am beginning to, for it suddenly seems 
to me that the destruction of what 



should not be — that is, the destruction of what you people call 
evil — is less just and desirable 
than the conversion of this evil 
into what you call good." 

He hesitated. Then, almost as 
though he were surprised at his 
own words, he said, "Go, and sin 
no more!" 

Baley, smiling, took R. Daneel's elbow and they walked out 
the door, fleshly arm in robotic 
arm.
