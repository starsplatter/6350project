^~WNE of the niore piteous 
^-^ sounds of our era is the disenchanted cry of Arthur Koestler, perhaps our most noted — 
surely our most vocal and 
persistent — disappointee. His 
eruptions are not as frequent as 
Old Faithful's in Yellowstone 
National Park, but they are not 
a bit less predictable. He has 
honeymooned with one absolute 
after another, beginning with 
Communism, and his shrill divorce suits have deafened us as 
regularly as if he had to follow 
a schedule. 

It would seem that he had a 
little trouble meeting this hypothetical schedule, for, in a recent issue of Harper's Bazaar, he 
abjectly confesses that he was an 
"addict" of science fiction while 
living in America. 

As far as I had previously known, we've been reading 
science fiction because we enjoyed the exercise of speculating 
on possibilities and the excitement of living vicariously all over 
time and the Universe. 

Self-deluded fools that we are, 
we have been, according to Mr. 
Koestler, victims of a habit -forming vice, "like opium, murder 
thrillers and yoghurt diets," and 
he informs us that "a dim, inarticulate suspicion . . . that the 



human race may be a biological 
misfit doomed to extinction (is) 
one of the reasons for sudden 
interest in life on other stars." 

Mr. Koestler might properly 
have called his indictment 7 Escaped* from Decadent Capitalistic 
Science Fiction, and maybe he 
would have if there had been 
enough material for a book. Certainly such a book might have 
had a large sale, considering the 
millions who read and watch 
science fiction in magazines, 
books. TV and movies. 

I think he was wise not to try, 
however — his wildly pointing 
finger turns out to be much too 
wild when one looks around to 
see where he is pointing. 

I'll concede that opium is habitforming. Though I 'm less sure 
about murder thrillers, I won't 
argue. But the suggestion that 
there are people who can't take 
yoghurt or leave it alone is preposterous to anyone who has 
tasted the stuff. If an insatiable 
craving for goo with the texture 
and appearance of library paste 
and the flavor of brushless shaving cream can be developed, then 
chalk and tallow should be put 
on the narcotics list. 

In terms of evolution , every 
race must be regarded as a bio{continued on Page 31)

THE DARK DOOR 



By ALAN E. NOURSE 

The deadliest creatures known to Earth were 

hunting Scott . . . but the worst of it was that 
he couldn't defend himself from his friends! 

I: ' I 

IT was almost dark when he that he should never have slept, 
awoke, and lay on the bed, For almost half a minute, eyes

THE DARK DOOR

ing to hear some sound, some 
indication of their presence. 

But the only sound was the 
barely audible hum of his wristwatch, and the dismal splatter of 
raindrops on the cobbled street 
outside. There was no sound to 
feed his fear, yet he knew then, 
without a flicker of doubt, that 
they were going to kill him. 

He shook his head, trying to 
clear the sleep from his brain as 
he turned the idea over and over 
in his mind. He wondered why he 
hadn't realized it before — long 
before, back when they had first 
started this horrible, nervewracking cat-and-mouse game. 
The idea just hadn't occurred to 
him before. But he knew the 
game-playing was over. They 
wanted to kill him now. And he 
knew that ultimately they would 
kill him. There was no way for 
him to escape. 

TTE sat up on the edge of the 
bed, painfully, perspiration 
standing out on his bare back, 
and he waited for a long moment, 
listening. How could he have 
slept, exposing himself so helplessly? Every ounce of his energy, 
all the skill and wit and shrewdness at his command were necessary in this cruel hunt; yet he 
had taken the incredibly terrible 
chance of sleeping, of losing consciousness, leaving himself wide 
open and helpless against the at


tack which he knew was inevitable. 

How much had he lost? How 
close had they come while he 
slept? 




Fearfully he walked to the 
window, peered out, and felt his 
muscles relax a little. The gray, 
foggy streets were still light. He 
still had a little time before the 
terrible night began — 

He stumbled across the small, 
old-fashioned room, sensing that 
action of some sorj: was desperately needed. The bathroom was 
small; he stared at his face in the 
battered, stained reflector unit, 
shocked at the red-eyed stubblefaced apparition that stared out 
at him. 

This is Harry Scott, he 
thought, thirty-two years old, and 
at the prime of life — but not the 
same Harry Scott that started out 
on this ridiculous quest so many 




 



months ago. This Harry Scott 
was being hunted like an animal, 
driven by fear, helpless — and sure 
to die, unless he could find an 
escape, somehow. But there were 
too many of them for him to escape, and they were too clever, 
and they knew -he knew too much. 

He stepped into the showershave unit, trying to relax, to 
collect his racing thoughts — 
above all, trying to stay this fear 
that burned through his mind, 
driving him to panic and desperation. The memory of the last 
hellish night was too stark in his 
mind to allow relaxation — the 
growing fear, the silent, desperate 
hunt through the night; the realization that their numbers were 
increasing; his frantic search for 
a hiding place in the New City; 
and finally his panic-stricken, 
pell-mell flight down into the alleys and cobbled streets and 
crumbling frame buildings of the 
Old City . . . Even more horrible, 
the friends who had turned on 
him, who turned out to be like 
them. 

Back in the bedroom, he lay 
down again, his body still tense. 
There were sounds in the building, footsteps moving around on 
the floor overhead, a door banging somewhere down on the street. 
With every sound, every breath 
of noise, his muscles tightened 
still further, freezing him in fear. 
His own breath was shallow and 



rapid in his ears as he lay, listening, waiting. 

TF only something would hap
pen! He wanted to scream, to 
bang his head against the wall, 
to run about the room smashing 
his fist into doors, breaking every 
piece of furniture. It was the 
waiting, the eternal waiting, and 
running, waiting some more, feeling the net drawing tighter and 
tighter as he waited, feeling the 
measured, unhurried tread behind him, always following, coming closer and closer, as though 
he were a mouse on a string, 
twisting and jerking helplessly. 

If only they would move, do 
something he could counter 1 . 

But he wasn*t even sure any 
more that he could detect them. 
And they were so careful nevei 
to move into the open. 

He jumped up feverishly, 
moved to the window, peered between the slats of the dusty, oldfashioned blind out at the street 
below. 

An empty street at first . . . 
wet, gloomy. He saw no one. 
Then he caught the flicker of 
light in an entry several doors 
down and across the street, as a 
dark figure sparked a cigarette to 
life, and Harry felt the chill run 
down his back again. Still there, 
then, still waiting, a hidden figure, always present, always waiting .. . 



THE DARK DOOR 



Harry's eyes scanned the rest 
of the street rapidly. Two threewheelers rumbled by, their rubber hissing on the wet street. One 
of them carried the blue-andwhite of the Old City police, but 
the car didn't slow up or hesitate 
as it passed the dark figure in the 
doorway. And they would never 
help him anyway, Harry thought 
bitterly. He had tried that before, 
and met with ridicule and threats. 
There would be no help from the 
police in the Old City. 

And then he saw another figure, coming around a corner. 
There was something vaguely 
familiar about the tall body and 
broad shoulders as the man walked across the wet street, something Harry vaguely recognized 
from somewhere during the spinning madness of the past few 
weeks. 

The man's eyes turned up toward the window for the briefest 
instant, then returned steadfastly 
to the street. Oh, they were sly, 
so damned sly! You could never 
spot them looking at you, never 
for sure, but they were always 
there, always nearby. And there 
was no one he could trust any 
longer, no one to whom he could 
turn. 

Not even George Webber. 

SWIFTLY his mind reconsiderered that possibility as he 
watched the figure move down 



the street. True, Dr. Webber had 
started him out on this search in 
the first place. But even Webber 
would never believe what he had 
found. Webber was a scientist, a 
researcher. 

What could he do — go to Webber and tell him that there were 
men alive in the world who were 
not men, who were somehow men 
and something more? 

Could he walk into Dr. Webber's office in the Hoffman Medical Center, walk through the 
gleaming bright corridors, past 
the shining metallic doors, and 
tell Dr. Webber that he had 
found people alive in the world 
who could actually see in four 
dimensions, live in four dimensions, think in four dimensions? 

Could he explain to Dr. Webber that he knew this simply because in some way he had sensed 
them, and traced them, and discovered them; that he had not 
one iota of proof, except that he 
was being followed by them, 
hunted by them, even now, in a 
room in the Old City, waiting for 
them to strike him down? 

He shook his head, almost sobbing. That was what was so horrible. He couldn't tell Webber, 
because Webber would be certain that he had gone mad, just 
like the rest. He couldn't tell 
anyone, he couldn't do anything. 
He could just wait, and run, and 
wait —

It was almost dark now and 
the creaking of the old board 
house intensified the fear that 
tore at Harry Scott's mind. Tonight was the night; he was sure 
of it. Maybe he had been foolish 
in coming down here to the slum 
area, where the buildings were 
relatively unguarded, where anybody could come and go as he 
pleased. But the New City had 
hardly been safer, even in the 
swankiest private chamber in the 
highest building. They had had 
agents there, too, hunting him, 
driving home the bitter lesson of 
fear they had to teach him. Now 
he was afraid enough; now they 
were ready to kill him. 

Down below he heard a door 
bang, and froze, his back against 
the wall opposite the door. There 
were footsteps, quiet voices, barely audible. His whole body shook 
and his eyes slid around to the 
window. Still the figure in the 
doorway waited — but the other 
figure was not visible. He heard 
the steps on the stair, ascending 
slowly, steadily, a tread that 
paced itself with the powerful 
throbbing of his own pulse. 

Then the telephone screamed 
out — 

TJE gasped. The footsteps were 
on the floor below, moving 
steadily upward. The telephone 
rang again and again; the shrill 
jangling filled the room insistent


ly. He waited until he couldn't 
wait any longer. Then his hand 
fumbled in a pocket and leveled 
a tiny, dull-gray metal object at 
the door. With the other hand, he 
took the receiver from the hook. 

"Harry! Is that you?" 

His throat was like sandpaper 
and the words came out in a rasp. 
"What is it?" 

"Harry, this is George — George 
Webber—" 

His eyes were glued to the 
door. "All right. What do you 
want?" 

"You've got to come talk to 
us, Harry. We've been waiting 
for weeks now. You promised us. 
We've got to talk to you." 

Harry still watched the door, 
but his breath came easier. The 
footsteps moved with ridiculous 
slowness up the stairs, down the 
hall toward the room. 

"What do you want me to do? 
They've come to kill me—" 

There was a long pause. "Harry, are you sure?" 

"Dead sure." 

"Can you make a break for 

it?" 

Harry blinked. "I could try. 
But it won't do any good—" 

"Well, at least try, Harry. Get 
here to the Hoffman Center. 
We'll help you all we can — " 

"I'll try." Harry's words were 
hardly audible as he set the receiver down with a trembling 
hand. 



THE DARK DOOR 



9 



The room was silent. The footsteps had stopped. A wave of 
panic passed up Harry's spine; 
he crossed the room, threw open 
the door, stared up and down the 
hall, unbelieving. 

The hall was empty. He started down toward the stairs at a 
dead run, and then, too late, saw 
the faint golden glow of a Parkinson Field across the dingy corridor. He gasped in fear, and 
screamed out once as he struck 
it. 

And then, for seconds stretching into hours, he heard "his 
scream echoing and re-echoing 
down long, bitter miles of hollow 
corridor. 

II 

GEORGE Webber leaned back 
in the "Soft chair, turning a 
quizzical glance toward the 
younger man across the room. 
He lit a long black cigar. 

"Well?" His heavy voice boomed out in the small room. "Now 
that we've got him here, what do 
you think?" 

The younger man glanced uncomfortably through the glass 
wall panel into the small dark 
room beyond. In the dimness, he 
could barely make out the still 
form on the bed, grotesque with 
the electrode-vernier apparatus 
already in place at its temples. 
Dr. Manelli looked away sharp


ly, and leafed through the thick 
sheaf of chart papers,ih his hand. 

"I don't know," he said dully. 
"I just don't know what' ; to 
think." 

The other man's laugh seemed 
to rise from the depths of his 
huge chest. His heavy face 
creased into a thousand wrinkles. 
Dr. Webber was a large man, his 
broad shoulders carrying a suggestion of immense power that 
matched the intensity of his dark, 
wide-set eyes. He watched Dr. 
Manelli's discomfort grow, saw 
the younger doctor's ears grow 
red, and the almost cruel lines in 
his face were masked as he laughed still louder. 

"Trouble with you, Frank, you 
just don't have the courage of 
your convictions." 

"Well, I don't see anything so 
funny about it!" Manelli's eyes 
were angry. "The man has a suspicious syndrome — so you've followed him, and spied on him for 
weeks on end, which isn't exactly highest ethical practice in 
collecting a history. I still can't 
see how you're justified — " 

Dr. Webber snorted, tossing his 
cigar down on the desk with disgust. "The man is insane. That's 
my justification. He's out of 
touch with reality — he's wandered into a wild, impossible, fantastic dream world. And' we've 
got to get him out of jt, because 
what he knows, what 'he's trying 



10 




 



to hide from us, is so incredibly 
dangerous that we don't dare let 
him go." 

The big man stared at Manelli, 
his dark eyes flashing. "Can't you 
see that? Or would you rather sit 
back and let Harry Scott go the 
way that Paulus and Wineberg 
and the others went?" 

"But to use the Parkinson 
Field on him — '■' Dr. Manelli 
shook his head hopelessly. "He'd 
offered to come over, George. We 
didn't need to use it." 

"Sure, he offered to come — 
fine, fine. But supposing he 
changed his mind on the way? 
For all we know, he had us figured into his paranoia, too, and 
never would have come near the 
Hoffman Center." 

Dr. Webber shook his head. 
"We're not playing a game any 
more, Frank. Get that straight. I 
thought it was a game a couple 
of years ago, when we first started. But it ceased to be a game 
when men like Paulus and Wineberg walked in sane, healthy 
men, and came out blubbering 
idiots. That's no game any more. 
We're onto something big. And, 
if Harry Scott can lead us to the 
core of it, then I can't care too 
much what happens to Harry 
Scott." 

TAR. Manelli stood up sharply, 
walked to the window, and 
looked down over the bright, 



clean buildings of the Hoffman 
Medical Center. Out across the 
terraced park that surrounded the 
glassed towers and shining metal 
of the Center rose the New City, 
tier upon tier of smooth, functional architecture, a city of 
dreams built up painfully out of 
the rubble of the older, ruined 
city. 

"You could kill him," the 
young man said finally. "The 
psycho- integrator isn't any standard interrogative technique; it's 
dangerous and treacherous. You 
never know for sure just what 
you're doing when you dig down 
there in a man's brain tissue with 
those little electrode probes . . ." 

"But we can learn the truth 
about Harry Scott," Dr. Webber 
broke in. "Six months ago, Harry 
Scott was working with us, a 
quiet, affable, pleasant young 
fellow, extremely intelligent, intensely cooperative. He was just 
the man we needed to work with 
us, an engineer who could take 
our data and case histories, study 
them, and subject them to a completely non-medical analysis. Oh, 
we had to have it done — the 
problem's been with us for a 
hundred years now, growing ever 
since the 1950s and 60s — insanity 
in the population, growing, 
spreading without rhyme or reason, insinuating itself into every 
nook and cranny of our civilized 
life." 



THI DARK DOOR 



1 1 



The big man blinked at Manelli. "Harry Scott was the new 
approach. We were too close to 
the problem. We needed a nonmedical outsider to take a look, 
to tell us what we were missing. 
So Harry Scott walked into the 
problem, and then abruptly lost 
contact with us. We finally track 
him down and find him gone, out 
of touch with reality — on the 
same wretched road that all the 
others went. With Harry, it's 
paranoia. He's being persecuted; 
he has the whole world against 
him, but most important — the 
factor we don't dare overlook — 
he's no longer working on the 
problem." 

Manelli shifted uneasily. "I 
suppose that's right — " 

"Of course it's right!" Dr. 
Webber's eyes flashed. "Harry 
found something in those statistics. Something about the data, 
or the case histories, or something Harry Scott himself dug 
up opened a door for him to go 
through, a door that none of us 
ever dreamed existed. We don't 
know what he found on the other 
side of that door. Oh, we know 
what he thinks he found, all this 
garbage about people that look 
like everyone else, but who walk 
through walls when nobody's 
looking, who think around corners instead of in straight-line 
logic. But what he really found 
there, we don't have any way of 



telling. We just know that whatever he really found is something 
new, something unsuspected — 
something so dangerous it can 
drive an intelligent man into the 
wildest delusions of paranoid 
persecution — " 

A new light appeared in Dr. 
Manelli's eyes as he faced the 
other doctor. "Wait a minute," 
he said softly. "The integrator is 
an experimental instrument, too." 

Dr. Webber smiled slyly. "Now 
we're beginning to think," he 
said. 

"But you'll see only what Scott 
himself believes. And he thinks 
his story is true." 

"Then we'll have to break his 
story." 

"Break it?" 

"Certainly. For some reason, 
this delusion of persecution is far 
safer for Harry Scott than facing 
what he really found out. What 
we've got to do is to make this 
delusion less safe than the truth." 

The room was silent for a long 
moment. Manelli lit a cigarette, 
his fingers trembling. "Let's hear 
it." 

"We're really going to persecute Harry Scott — as he's never 
been persecuted before." 

Ill 

A T first he thought he was at 
the bottom of a deep well 
and he lay quite still, his eyes 



12 




 



clamped shut, wondering where 
he was and how he could possibly have come there. He could 
feel the dampness and chill of 
the stone floor under him, and 
nearby he heard the damp, insistent drip of water splashing 
against stone. He felt his muscles 
tighten as the dripping sound 
forced itself against his senses. 
Then he opened his eyes. 

His first impulse was to scream 
out wildly, in unreasoning, suffocating fear. He fought it down, 
struggling to sit up in the blackness, his whole mind turned in 
bitter, hopeless hatred at the ones 
who had hunted him for so long, 
and now had trapped him. 

Why? 

Why did they torture him ? 
Why not kill him outright, have 
done with it? He shuddered, and 
struggled to his feet, staring about 
him in horror. 

It was not a well, but a little 
room, circular, with little rivulets 
of stale water running down the 
granite walls. The ceiling closed 
low over his head, and the only 
source of light came from the 
single doorway opening into a 
long, low stone passageway. 

Wave after wave of panic rose 
into Harry's throat. Each time 
he fought down the urge to 
scream, to lie down on the ground 
and cover his face with his hands 
and scream in helpless fear. How 
could they have known the hor


ror that lay in his own mind, the 
horror of darkness, of damp, 
slimy walls and scurrying rodents, of the clinging, stale humidity of dungeon passageways? 
He himself had seldom recalled 
it, except in his most hideous 
dreams, yet he had known such 
fear as a boy, so many years ago 
— and now he was in it. They 
had known somehow and used it 
against him. 
Why? 

He sank down on the floor, his 
head in his hands, trying to think 
straight, to find some clue in the 
turmoil bubbling through his 
mind that would tell him what 
had happened. 

He had started down the hallway from his room, to find Dr. 
Webber and tell him about the 
other people — 

He stopped short, looked up 
wide-eyed. Had he been going to 
Dr. Webber? Had he actually decided to go? Perhaps — yes, perhaps he had, though Webber 
would only laugh at such a ridiculous story. But the not-men who 
had hunted him would not laugh ; 
to them, it would not be funny. 
They knew that it was true. And 
they knew he knew it was true. 

But why not kill him? Why 
this torture? Why this horrible 
persecution that dug into the 
depths of his own nightmares to 
haunt him? 

His breath came fast and a 



THE DARK DOOR 



13 



chilly sweat broke out on his 
forehead. Where was he? Was 
this some long forgotten vault 
in the depths of the Old City? 
Or was this another place, another world, perhaps, that the 
not-men, with their impossible 
powers, had created to torture 
him? 

¥¥IS eyes sought the end of the 

hall, saw the turn at the end, 
saw the light which seemed to 
come from the end; and then in 
an instant he was running down 
the damp passageway, his pulse 
pounding at his temples, until he 
could hardly gasp enough breath 
as he ran. Finally he reached the 
turn in the corridor, where the 
light was brighter, and he swung 
around to stare at the source of 
the light, a huge, burning, smoky 
torch which hung from the wall. 

Even as he looked at it, the 
torch went out, shutting him into 
inky blackness. The only sound 
at first was the desperation of 
his own breath; then he heard 
little scurrying sounds around his 
feet, and screamed involuntarily 
as something sleek and four-footed jumped at his chest with snapping jaws. 

Shuddering, he fought the 
thing off, his fingers closing on 
wiry fur as he caught and 
squeezed. The thing went limp, 
and suddenly melted in his hands, 
and he heard it splash as it 



struck the damp ground at his 
feet— 

What were they doing to his 
mind? 

He screamed out in horror, then 
followed the echoes of his own 
scream as he ran down the stone 
corridor, blindly, slipping on the 
wet stone floor, falling on his 
knees into inches of brackish 
water, scraping back to his feet 
with an uncontrollable convulsion of fear and loathing, only 
to run more — 

The corridor suddenly broke 
into two and he stopped short. 
He didn't know how far, or how 
long, he had run, but it suddenly 
occurred to him that he was still 
alive, still safe. Only his mind 
was under attack, only his mind 
was afraid, teetering on the edge 
of control. And this maze of 
dungeon tunnels — where could 
such a thing exist, so perfectly 
outfitted to horrify him, so neatly 
fitting into his own pattern of 
childhood fears and terrors; 
where could such a very individual attack on his sanity have 
sprung — ? 

• Except irom his own mind. 

For an instant, he saw a flicker 
of light, thought he grasped the 
edge of a concept previously obscure to his mind. He stared 
around him, at the mist swirling 
down the damp, dark corridors, 
and thought of the rat that had 
melted in his hand. Then sudden


ly 




 



ly his mind was afire, searching 
through his experience with the 
strange not-men he had learned 
to detect, trying to remember 
everything he had learned and 
deduced about them before they 
began their brutal persecution. 

They were men, and they 
looked like men, but they were 
different. They had other properties of mind, other capabilities 
that men did not have. 

They were not-men, then. They 
could exist, and co-exist, two people in one frame, one person 
known, realized by all who saw, 
the other one concealed except 
from those who learned how to 
look. They could use their minds; 
they could rationalize correctly; 
they could use their curious fourdimensional knowledge to bring 
them to answers no three-dimensional man could reach — 

Bur they couldn't project into 
men's minds! 

/CAREFULLY, Harry peered 
down the misty tunnels. 
They were clever, these creatures, 
and powerful. They had done 
their work of fear and terror 
on his mind skillfully, since they 
had discovered that he knew 
them. But they were limited, too; 
they couldn't make things happen that were not true— fantasies, 
illusions ... 

Yet this dungeon was an illusion, It had to be. 



He cursed and started down the 
right-hand corridor, his heart 
sinking. There was no such place 
and he knew it. He was walking 
in a dream, a fantasy that had 
no substance, that could do no 
more than frighten him, drive 
him insane; yet he must already 
have lost his mind to be in such 
an illusion. 

Why had he delayed? Why 
hadn't he gone to the Hoffman 
Center, laid the whole story before Dr. Webber and Dr. Manelli at the very first, told them 
what he had found? True, they 
might have thought him insane, 
but they wouldn't have put him 
to torture. They might even have 
believed him enough to investigate what he told them, and then 
the cat would have been out of 
the bag. The tale would have 
been incredible, but at least his 
mind would have been safe — 

He turned down another corridor, walked suddenly into 
waist-deep water, so cold it 
numbed his legs, and he stopped 
again to force back the tendrils of unreasoning horror that 
brushed his mind. Nothing could 
really harm him. He would merely wait until his mind finally 
reached a balance again. There 
might be no end; it might be a 
ghastly trap, but he would 
wait . . . 

Strangely, the mist was becoming greenish in color as it swirled 



THE DARK DOOR 



15 



THE DAJtK DOOR 



toward him in the damp vaulted 
passageway. His eyes began 
watering a little and the lining 
of his nose started to burn. He 
stopped short, newly alarmed, 
and stared at the walls, rubbing 
the tears away to clear his vision. 
The greenish -yellow haze grew 
thicker, catching his eyes and 
burning like a thousand furies, 
ripping into his throat until 
he" was choking and coughing, 
as though great knives sliced 
through his lungs. 

He tried to scream, and started 
running, blindly. Each gasping 
breath was an agony as the blistering gas dug deeper and deeper 
into his lungs. Reason departed 
from him; he was screaming incoherently as he stumbled up a 
stony ramp, crashed into a wall, 
spun around and smashed blindly 
into another. Then something 
caught at his shirt. 

He felt the heavy planks and 
pounded iron scrollwork of a 
huge door, and threw himself 
upon it, wrenching at the rusty 
latch until the door swung open 
with a screech of rusty hinges; 
and he fell forward on his face. 
The door swung shut behind him. 

He lay face down, panting and 
sobbing in the stillness. 

COARSE hands grasped his 
collar, jerking him rudely to 
his feet, and he opened his eyes. 
Across the dim, vaulted room he 



could see the shadowy form of a 
man, a big man, with broad chest 
and powerful shoulders, a man 
whose rich voice Harry almost 
recognized, but whose face was 
deep in shadow. And as Harry 
wiped the tears from his tortured 
eyes, he heard the man's voice 
rumble out at him: 

"Perhaps you've had enough 
now to change your mind about 
telling us the truth." 

Harry stared, not quite comprehending. "The — the truth?" 

The man's voice was harsh, 
cutting across the room impatiently. "The truth, I said. The 
problem, you fool — what you 
saw, what you learned — you 
know perfectly well what I'm 
referring to. But we'll swallow 
no more of this silly four-dimensional superman tale, so don't 
bother to start it." 

"I — I don't understand you. 
It's — it's true — " Again he tried 
to peer across the room. "Why 
are you hunting me like this? 
What are you trying to do to 
me?" 

"We want the truth. We want 
to know what you saw." 

"But — but you're what I saw — 
You know what I found out — I 
mean — " He stopped, his face 
going white. His hand went to 
his mouth, and he stared still 
harder. "Who are you?" he whispered. 

"The truth!" the man roared. 



18 



GALAXY SCIENCE PICTION 



"You'd better be quick, or you'll 
be back in the corridor." 
"Webber!" 

"Your last chance, Harry." 

Without warning, Harry was 
across the room, flying across the 
desk, crashing into the big man's 
chest. A stream of fury flew 
from his mouth as he fought, 
driving his fists into the powerful 
chest, wrenching at the thick, 
flailing arms of the startled man. 

"It's you!" he screamed. "It's 
you that's been torturing me. It's 
you that's been hunting me down 
all this time, not the other people, 
you and your crowd of ghouls 
have been at my throat!" 

He threw the big man off balance, dropped heavily on him 
as he fell back to the ground, 
glared down into the other's 
angry brown eyes. 

And then, as though he had 
never been there at all, the big 
man vanished, and Harry sat 
back on the floor, his whole body 
shaking with frustrated sobs as 
his mind twisted in anguish. 

He had been wrong, completely 
wrong— ever - since he had discovered the not-men. Because 
he had thought they had been 
the ones who hunted and tortured 
him for so long. And now he 
knew how far he had been wrong. 
For the face of the shadowy man, 
the man behind the nightmare he 
was living, was . the face of Dr. 
George Webber. 



'"Y^OU'RE a fool," said Dr. 

Manelli sharply, as he turned 
away from the sleeping figure on 
the bed to face the older man. 
"Of all the ridiculous things, to 
let him connect you with this!" 
The young doctor turned abruptly and sank down in a chair, 
glowering at Dr. Webber. "You 
haven't gotten to first base yet, 
but you've just given Scott 
enough evidence to free himself 
from integrator control altogether, if he gives it any thought. 
But I suppose you realize that." 

"Nonsense," Dr. Webber retorted. "He had enough information to do that when we first 
started. I'm no more worried now 
than I was then. I'm sure he 
doesn't know enough about the 
psycho-integrator to be able to 
voluntarily control the patientoperator relationship to any degree. Oh, no — he's safe enough. 
But you've missed the whole 
point of that little interview." 
Dr. Webber grinned at Manelli. 

"I'm afraid I have. It looked 
to me like useless bravado." 

"The persecution, man, the 
persecution.' He's shifted his 
sights! Before that interview, the 
not-men were torturing him, remember? Because they were 
afraid he would report his findings to me, of course. But now it's 
/ that's against him." The grin 
widened. "You see where that 
leads?" 



THE DARK DOOR 



19 



"You're talking almost as 
though you believed this story 
about a different sort of people 
among us." 

Dr. Webber shrugged. "Perhaps I do." 

"Oh, come now, George." 

Dr. Webber's eyebrows went up 
and the grin disappeared from 
his face. 

"Harry Scott believes it, Frank. 
We mustn't forget that, or miss 
its significance. Before Harry 
started this investigation of his, 
he wouldn't have paid any attention to such nonsense. But he 
believes it now." 

"But Harry Scott is insane. 
You said it yourself." 

"Ah, yes," said Dr. Webber. 
"Insane. Just like the others who 
started to get somewhere along 
those lines of investigation. Try 
to analyze the growing incidence 
of insanity in the population and 
you yourself go insane. You've 
got to be crazy to be a psychiatrist. It's an old joke, but it isn't 
very funny any more. And it's 
too much for coincidence. 

"And then consider the nature 
of the insanity — a full-blown 
paranoia — oh, it's amazing. A 
cunning organization of men who 
are nor-men, a regular fairy story, 
all straight from Harry Scott's 
agile young mind. But now it's 
we who are persecuting him, and 
he still believes his fairy tale — " 

"So?" 



Dr. Webber's eyes flashed angrily. "It's too neat, Frank. It's 
clever, and it's powerful, whatever we've run up against. But I 
think we've got an ace in the 
hole. We have Harry Scott." 

"And you really think he'll 
lead us somewhere?" 

Dr. Webber laughed. "That 
door I spoke of that Harry peeked 
through — I think he'll go back to 
it again. I think he's started to 
open that door already. And this 
time I'm going to follow him 
through." 

IV 

TT seemed incredible, yet Harry 
Scott knew he had not been 
mistaken. It had been Dr. Webber's face he had seen — a face 
no one forgot, an unmistakable 
face. And that meant that it had 
been Dr. Webber who had been 
persecuting him. 

But why? He had been going 
to report to Webber when he 
had run into that golden field 
in the rooming-house hallway. 
And then suddenly things had 
changed — 

Harry felt a chill reaching to 
his fingers and toes. Yes, something had changed, all right. The 
attack on him had suddenly become butcherous, cruel, sneaking 
into his mind somehow to use his 
most dreaded nightmares against 
him. There was no telling what 



20 




 



new horrors might be waiting for 
him. But he knew that he would 
lose his mind unless he could 
find an escape. 

He was on his feet, his heart 
pounding. He had to get out of 
here, wherever he was. He had to 
get back to town, back to the 
city, back to where people were 
again. If he could find a place 
to hide, a* place where he could 
rest, he could try to think his 
way out of this ridiculous maze, 
or at least try to understand it. 

He wrenched at the door to 
the passageway, started through, 
and smashed face-up against a 
solid brick wall. 

He cried out and jumped back 
from the wall . Blood trickled 
from his nose. The door was 
walled up, the mortar dry and 
hard. 

Frantically, he glanced around 
the room. There were no other 
doors, only the row of tiny windows around the ceiling of the 
room, pale, ghostly squares of 
light. 

He pulled the chair over to the 
windows, peered out through the 
cobwebbed openings to the corridor beyond. 

It was not the same hallway as 
before, but an old, dirty building corridor, incredibly aged, with 
bricks sagging away from the 
walls. At the end he could see 
stairs, and even the faintest hint 
of sunlight coming from above. 



Wildly, he tore at the masonry 
of the window, chipping away at 
the soggy mortar with his fingers 
until he could squeeze through 
the opening. He fell to the floor 
of the corridor outside. 

It was much colder and the 
silence was no longer so intense. 
He seemed to feel, rather than 
hear, the surging power, the rumble of many machines, the little, 
almost palpable vibrations from 
far above him. 

He started in a dead run down 
the musty corridor to the stairs 
and began to climb them, almost 
stumbling over himself in his 
eagerness. 

After several flights, the brick 
walls gave way to cleaner plastic, 
and suddenly a brightly lighted 
corridor stretched before him. 

Panting from the climb, Harry 
ran down the corridor to the end, 
wrenched open a door, and looked 
out anxiously. 

HE was almost stunned by the 
bright light. At first he 
couldn't orient himself as he 
stared down at the metal ramp, 
the moving strips of glowing 
metal carrying the throngs of 
people, sliding along the thoroughfare before him, unaware of 
him watching, unaware of any 
change from the usual. The towering buildings before him rose to 
unbelievable heights, bathed in 
ever-changing rainbow colors, 



THE DARK DOOR 



21 



and he felt his pulse thumping in 
his temples as he gaped. 

He was in the New City, of 
that there was no doubt. This was 
the part of the great metropolis 
which had been built again since 
the devastating war that had 
nearly wiped the city from the 
Earth a decade before. These were 
the moving streets, the beautiful 
residential apartments, following 
the modern neo-functional patterns and participational design 
which had completely altered the 
pattern of city living. The Old 
City still remained, of course — 
the slums, the tenements, the 
skid-rows of the metropolis — but 
this was the teeming heart of the 
city, a new home for men to 
live in. 

And this was the stronghold 
where the not-men could be 
found, too. The thought cut 
through Harry's mind, sending a 
tremor up his spine. He had 
found them here; he had uncovered his first clues here, and 
discovered them; and even now 
his mind was filled with the horrible, paralyzing fear he had felt 
that first night when he had made 
the discovery. Yet he knew now 
that he dared not go back where 
he had come from. 

At least he could understand 
why the not-men might have 
feared and persecuted him, but 
he could not understand the horrible assault that Dr. Webber 



had unleashed. And somehow he 
found Dr. Webber's attack infinitely more frightening. 

He seemed to be safe here , 
though, at least for the moment. 

QUICKLY he moved down 
onto the nearest moving 
ramp, heading toward the living 
section of the New City. He 
knew where he could go there, 
where he could lock himself in, 
a place where he could think, 
possibly find a way to fight off 
Dr. Webber's attack of nightmares. 

He settled back on the seat, 
watching the city moving past 
him for several minutes before 
he noticed the curious shadowform which seemed to whisk out 
of his field of vision every time 
he looked — 

They were following him 
again! He looked around wildly 
as the strip moved swiftly 
through the cool evening air. Far 
above, he could see the shimmering, iridescent screen which 
sti II stood to protect the New 
City from the devastating virus 
attacks which might again strike 
down from the skies without 
warning. And far ahead he could 
see the magnificent "bridge" 
formed by the strip crossing over 
to the apartment area, where the 
thousands who worked in the 
New City were returning to their 
homes. 



22 




 



And still somecfne was following him ... 

Then he heard the sound, so 
close to his ear he jumped, yet 
so small he could hardly identify 
it as a human voice. "What was 
it you found, Harry? What did 
you discover? Better tell, better 
tell—" 

He swung around, staring, seeing nothing but the nearby passengers, and the dark, intangible 
shadow which he couldn't quite 

see. 

"Better tell us, Harry — better 
tell. Unless you want the nightmares to start again . . ." 

He shook his head, fear rising 
up in his chest. Voices in his 
ear, illusions . . . they couldn't 
be happening. He tried stuffing 
his fingers into his ears, but the 
voice followed him, even through 
his fingers. 

"The nightmares, Harry — you 
haven't even tasted horror yet — 
unless you tell us what you discovered — " 

"No, no!" The words burst 
from his lips inadvertently. A 
dozen faces turned sharply toward him, a dozen pair of eyes 
shifted away in embarrassment. 
He cursed himself under his 
breath, and tried to sink back 
in the seat, tried to relax and 
regain control of his trembling 
fingers. 

Above all, he knew that he 
dared not attra ct attention , 



arouse suspicion among the passers-by. There was too much insanity in the world for the authorities to take any chance on 
outbreaks of violence. Any suspicious action, he knew, would 
bring a quick arrest and an examination that might put him in 
an asylum. And that chance he 
dared not take, not until he found 
some way to protect himself from 
Webber's attack. 

"Better tell us, Harry — better 
tell—" 

TTE saw the rift in the moving 
strip coming, far ahead, a 
great, gaping rent in the metal 
fabric of the swiftly moving road, 
as if a huge blade were slicing it 
down the middle. Harry's hand 
went to his mouth, choking back 
a scream as the hole moved with 
incredible rapidity down the center of the strip, swallowing up 
whole rows of the seats, moving 
straight toward his own. 

He glanced in fright over the 
side just as the strip moved out 
on the "bridge" and he gasped 
as he saw the towering canyons 
of buildings fall far below the 
road, saw the>seats tumble end 
over end, heard the sounds of 
screaming blend into the roar of 
air by his ears. 

Then the rift screamed by him 
with a demoniac whine and he 
sank back into his seat, gasping 
as the two cloven halves of the 



THE DARK DOOR 



23 



strip clanged back together again. 

He stared at the people around 
him on the strip and they stared 
back at him, mildly, unperturbed, 
and returned to their evening 
papers as the strip passed through 
the first local station on the other 
side of the "bridge." 

And then Harry Scott was on 
his feet, moving swiftly across 
the slower strips for the exit 
channels. He noted the station 
stop vaguely, but his only 
thought now was speed, desperate speed, fear-driven speed to 
put into action the plan that had 
suddenly burst into his mind. 

He knew that he had reached 
his limit. He had come to a point 
beyond which he couldn't fight 
alone. 

Somehow, Webber had burrowed into his brain, laid his 
mind open to attacks of nightmare and madness that he could 
never hope to fight. Facing this 
alone, he would lose his mind. 
His only hope was to go for help 
to the ones he feared only slightly 
less, the ones who had minds capable of fighting back for him. 

He crossed under the moving 
strips and boarde#the one going 
back into the heart of the city 
again. Somewhere there, he 
hoped, he would find the help 
he needed. Somewhere back in 
that city were men he had discovered who were men and something more — 



Tj^RANK Manelli carefully took 
the blood pressure of the 
sleeping figure on the bed; then 
turned to the other man. "He'll 
be dead soon," he snapped. "Another few minutes now is all it'll 
take. Just a few more." 

"Absurd. There's nothing in 
these stimuli that can kill him." 
George Webber sat tense, his eyes 
fixed on the pale fluctuating 
screen near the head of the bed. 

"His own mind can kill him! 
He's on the run now ; you've 
broken him loose from his nice 
safe paranoia. His mind is retreating, running back to some 
other delusion. It's escaping to 
the safety his fantasy people can 
afford him, these not-men he 
thinks about — " 

"Yes, yes," agreed Dr. Webber, 
his eyes eager. "Oh, he's on the 
run now." 

"But what will he do when he 
finds there aren't any 'not-men' 
to save him? What will he do 
then?" 

Webber looked up, frowning 
and grim. "Then we'll know what 
he found through the dark door 
that he opened, that's what — " 

"No, you're wrong! He'll die. 
He'll find nothing and the shock 
will kill him. My God, Webber, 
you can't tamper with a man's 
mind like this and hope to save 
his life! You're obsessed; you've 
always been obsessed by this impossible search for something in 



24 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



our society, some undiscovered 
factor to account for the mental 
illness, the divergent minds — but 
you can't kill a man to trace it 
down!" 

"It's too neat," said Webber. 
"He comes back to tell us the 
truth, and we call him insane. We 
say he's paranoid, throw him in 
restraint, place him in an asylum 
— and we never know what he 
found. The truth is too incredible; when we hear it, it must be 
insanity we're hearing — " 

The big doctor laughed outright, jabbing his thumb at the 
screen. "This isn't insanity we're 
seeing. Oh, no— this is the answer we're following. I won't stop 
now. I've waited too long for this 
show." 

"Well, I stay stop it while he's 
still alive." 

Dr. Webber's eyes were deadly. "Get out, Frank," he said 
softly. "I'm not stopping now." 

His eyes returned to the screen, 
to the bobbing figure that the 
psycho -integrator traced on the 
fluorescent background. Twenty 
years of search had led him here, 
and now he knew the end was at 
hand. 

V 

TT was a wild, nightmarish 
journey. At every step, Harry's 
senses betrayed him: his wristwatch turned into a brilliant blue


green snake that snapped at his 
wrist; the air was full of snarling creatures that threatened him 
at every step, but he fought them 
off, knowing that they would 
harm him far less than panic 
would. He had no idea where to 
hunt, nor whom to try to reach, 
but he knew they were there in 
the New City, and somehow he 
knew they would help him, if only 
he could find them. 

He stepped off the moving 
strip as soon as the lights of the 
center of the city were clear below, and stepped into the selfoperated lift that sped down to 
ground level. From the elevator, 
he moved onto one of the long, 
honeycombed concourses, filled 
with passing shoppers who stared 
at the colorful, enticing threedimensional displays. 

At one of the intersections 
» ahead, he spotted a visi phonestation, and dropped onto the 
little scat before the screen. There 
had been a number, if only he 
could recall it. But as he started 
to dial, the silvery screen shattered into a thousand sparkling 
glass chips, showering the floor 
with crystal and sparks. 

Harry cursed, grabbed the hand 
instrument, and jangled frantically for the operator. Before she 
could answer, the instrument 
grew warm in his hand, then hot 
and soft, like wax. Slowly, it 
melted and ran down his arm. 



THE DARK DOOR 



25 



He bolted out into the stream 
of people again, trying desperately to draw some comfort from 
the crowd around him. 

He felt utterly alone; he had 
to contact the not -men who were 
in the city, warn them, before 
they spotted him, of the attack 
he carried with him. If he were 
leading his pursuer, he could expect no mercy from the ones 
whose help he sought. He knew 
the lengths to which they would 
go to remain undetected in the 
society around them. Yet he had 
to find them. 

In the distance, he saw a figure 
waiting, back against one of the 
show windows. Harry stopped 
short, ducked into a doorway, and 
peered out fearfully. Their eyes 
locked for an instant; then the 
figure moved on. Harry felt a jolt 
of horror surge through him. Dr. 
Webber hunting him in person! 

He ducked out of the doorway, 
turned and ran madly in the opposite direction, searching with 
his eyes for an up escalator he 
could catch. Behind him he heard 
shots, heard the angry whine of 
tiny missiles past his ear. 

He breathed in great, gasping 
sobs as he found an almost empty 
escalator, and bounded up it four 
steps at a time. Below, he could 
see Webber coming too, his broad 
shoulders forcing their way relentlessly through the mill of 
people. 



Panting, Harry reached the 
top, checked his location against 
a wall map, and started down the 
long ramp which led toward the 
building he had tried to call. 

ANOTHER shot broke out behind him. The wall alongside 
powdered away, leaving a gaping 
hole. On impulse, he leaped into 
the hole, running agilely through 
to the rear of the building as the 
weakened wall swayed and crumbled into a heap of rubble just 
as Webber reached the place 
where Harry had entered. 

Harry breathed a sigh of relief 
and raced up the stairs of the 
building to reach a ramp on another level. He turned his eyes toward the tall building at the end 
of the concourse. There he could 
hide and relax and try, somehow, 
to make a contact — 

Someone fell into step beside 
him, and took his arm gently but 
firmly. Harry jerked away, turning terrified eyes to the one who 
had joined him. 

"Quiet," said the man, steering 
him over toward the edge of the 
concourse. "Not a sound. You'll 
be all right." 

Harry felt a tremor pass 
through his mind, the barest 
touching of mental fingertips, a 
recognition that sent a surge of 
eager blood through his heart. 

He stopped short, facing the 
man. "I'm being followed," he

THE DARK DOOR 



gasped. "You can't take me anywhere you don't want Webber to 
follow, or you'll be in terrible 
danger — " 

The stranger shrugged and 
smiled briefly. "You're not here. 
You're in a psycho -integrator. 
It can hurt you, if you let it. But 
it can't hurt me." He stepped up 
his pace slightly, and in a moment they turned abruptly into a 
darkened cul-de-sac. 

Quite suddenly, they were 
moving through the wall of the 
building into the brilliantly lit 
lobby of the tall building. Harry 
gasped, but the stranger led him 
without a sound toward the elevator, stepped aboard with him, 
and sped upward, the silence 
broken only by the whish-whishwhish of the passing floors. Finally they stepped out into a quiet 
corridor and down through a 
small office door. 

A man sat behind the desk in 
the office, his face quiet, his eyes 
very wide and dark. He hardly 
glanced at Harry, but turned his 
eyes to the other man. 

"Set?" he asked. 

"Couldn't miss now." 

The man nodded and looked 
at' last at Harry. "You're upset," 
he murmured. "What's bothering 
you?" 

"Webber," said Harry hoarsely. 
"He's following me here. He'll 
spot you. I tried to warn you 
before I came, but I couldn't — " 



JXiHE man at the desk smiled. 

"Webber again, eh? Our old 
friend Webber. That's all right. 
Webber's at the end of his tether. 
There's nothing he can do to stop 
us. He's trying to attack with 
force, and he fails to realize that 
time and thought are on our side. 
The time when force would have 
succeeded against us is long past. 
But now there are many of us — 
almost as many as not." 

Harry stared shrewdly at the 
man behind the desk. "Then why 
are you so afraid of Webber?" he 
asked. 

"Afraid?" 

"You know you are. Long ago 
you threatened me— if I reported 
to him. You watched me, played 
with me — Why are you afraid of 
him?" 

The man sighed. "Webber is 
premature. We are stalling for 
time, that's all. We wait. We have 
grown from so very few, back in 
the 1940s and 50s— but the time 
for quiet usurpation of power has 
not quite arrived. But men like 
Webber force our hand, discover 
us, try to expose us — " 

Harry Scott's face was white, 
his hands shaking. "And what do 
you do to them?" 

"We — deal with them." 

"And those like me?" 

The man smiled lopsidedly. 
"Those like Paulus and Wineberg 
and the rest — they're happy, 
really, like little children. But one 



2ft 




 



like you is so much more useful." 
He pointed almost apologetically 
to the small screen on his desk. 

Harry looked at it, realization 
dawning. He watched the huge, 
broad-shouldered figure moving 
down the hallway toward the 
door. 

"Webber was dangerous to 
you?" 

"Unbelievably dangerous. So 
dangerous we would use any 
means . . ." 

Suddenly the door burst open 
and Webber stood in the door, a 
triumphant Webber, face flushed, 
eyes wide, as he stared at the 
man behind the desk. 

The man smiled back and said, 
"Come on in, George. We've been 
waiting for you." 

Webber stepped through the 
door. "Manelli, you fool!" 

There was a blinding flash as 
he crossed the threshold. A faint 
crackle of sound reached Harry's 
ears; then, quite suddenly, the 
world blacked out . . . 

It might have been minutes, or 
hours, or days. The man who 
had been behind the desk was 
leaning over Harry, smiling down 
at him, gently bandaging the 
trephine wounds at his temples. 

"Gently," he said, as Harry 
tried to sit up. "Don't try to 
move. You've been through a 
rough time." 

Harry peered up at him. 
"You're — not Dr. Webber." 

THE DARK DOOR 



"No. I'm Dr. Manelli. Dr. 
Webber's been called away— an 
accident. He'll be some time recovering. I'll be taking care of 
you." 

Vaguely, Harry was aware that 
something was peculiar, something not quite as it should be. 
Then the answer dawned on him. 

"The statistical analysis!" he 
exclaimed. "I was supposed to 
get some data from Dr. Webber 
about an analysis — something 
about rising insanity rates." 

Dr. Manelli looked blank. "Insanity rates? You must be mistaken. You were brought here 
for an immunity examination, 
nothing more. But you can check 
with Dr. Webber — when- he gets 
back." 

VI 

GEORGE Webber sat in the 
darkness of the little room, 
trembling, listening, his eyes wide 
in the thick, misty darkness. He 
knew it would be a matter of 
time now. He couldn't run much 
farther. He hadn't seen them, 
true. Oh, they had been very 
clever, but they thought they 
were dealing with a fool, and 
they weren't. He knew they'd 
been following him; he'd known 
it for a long time now. 

It was just as he had been 
telling the man downstairs the 
night before: They were every« 

29 



where — your neighbor upstairs, 
the butcher on the corner, your 
own son or daughter, maybe even 
the man you were talking to — 
everywhere! 

And of course he had to warn 
as many people as he possibly 
could before they caught him, 
throttled him off, as they had 
threatened to if he talked to anyone. 

If only the people would listen 
to him when he told them how 
cleverly it was all planned, how 
it would be a matter of years, 
maybe even months or days before the change would happen, 
and the world would be quietly, 
silently taken over by the other 
people, the different people who 
could walk through walls and 
think in impossibly complex 
channels. And no one would know 
the difference, because business 
would go on as usual. 

He shivered, sinking down 
lower on the bed. If only people 
would listen to him— 

It wouldn't be long now. He 
had heard the stealthy footsteps 
on the landing below his room 
some time ago. This was the night 
they had chosen to make good 
their threats, to choke off his 
dangerous voice once and for all. 
There were footsteps on the stairs 
now, growing louder. 

Wildly he glanced around the 
room as the steps moved down 
the hall toward his door. And 



then he was over at the window, 
throwing up the sash, screaming 
out hoarsely to the silent street 
below: "Look out! They're here, 
all around us! They're planning 
to take over! Look out! Look 
out . . . P 

And then the door burst open 
and there were two men moving 
toward him, grim-faced, dressed 
in white — tall, strong men with 
sad faces and strong arms. 

One was saying, "Better come 
quietly, mister. No need to wake 
up the whole town."

logical misht, doomed to eventual 
extinction. So must all individuals. Julian Huxley, offering a 
healthy and useful bit of advice, 
points out that humanity must 
live as if it will never be dispossessed. This, of course, is the 
adjustment most of us make personally and as members of our 
possibly ephemeral race. Mr. 
Koestler, though, apparently insists on belonging only to a race 
that will never, never, never become extinct. A word of caution: 
Don't be taken in by microbes, 
insects and fish. They may look 
as if they haven't changed in 
eons, but they really have. 

"Life on other stars" is either 
a scientifically illiterate statement or unbridled literary license. 

Elsewhere in his bitter rue, Mr. 
Koestler, ever dissatisfied with 
anything less than a total and 
eternal absolute, quarrels with 
nobody but himself over whether science fiction will be THE 
literature of THE future. 

Here, I would say, is the major 
difference between Mr. K and 
practically all of us: Mr. K is 
relentlessly seeking the one economic system, the one philosophy, the one literature, the one 
future; we're willing to explore 
anything whatever that seems 
possible and will make an entertaining yet mind-prodding story. 



We don't expect science fiction 
to be anything more than one of 
many accepted branches of literature. Nothing can be THE literature indefinitely. Limericks 
almost were, for a while, and so 
were soap operas. 

Mr. K seems to curse this process of birth and death, but 
we're thankful for it. Limericks 
and soap operas and science fiction and everything else can become damnably irksome if there's 
no other choice. 

Several science fiction writers 
have laboriously created histories 
of the future as frameworks for 
their stories. The exercise was 
good and so were many of the 
stories, but an author can't help 
getting ideas that contradict 
others he's written. To sell these 
"contradictions," some authors 
had to use pen names! 

It doesn't bother us a bit to 
find each story negating every 
other story in an issue of GALAXY. 

But such liberties must be absolute torment to an absolutist 
mind like Mr. K's. He came to 
science fiction for THE answer 
and is enraged because it has too 
many. 

He is probably due to come 
screaming out of another dark 
room in a year or so. 

Wonder what it will be this 
time.

One man's poison 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

They could eat a horse, only 

luckily there was none ... ft 
might have eaten them first/ 

Illustrated by EMSH 



HELLMAN plucked the 
last radish out of the 
can with a pair of dividers. He held it up for Casker 
to admire, then laid it carefully 
on the workbench beside the 
razor. 

"Hell of a meal for two grown 
men," Casker said, flopping down 
in one of the ship's padded crash 
chairs. 

"If you'd like to give up your 
share — " Hellman started to suggest. 

Casker shook his head quickly. 



Hellman smiled, picked up the 
razor and examined its edge critically. 

"Don't make a production out 
of it," Casker said, glancing at 
the ship's instruments. They were 
approaching a red dwarf, the 
only planet- bearing sun in the 
vicinity. "We want to be through 
with supper before we get much 
closer." 

Hellman made a practice incision in the radish, squinting 
along the top of the razor. Casker bent closer, his mouth open. 



ONE MAN'S POISON 



33 



Hellman poised the razor delicately and cut the radish cleanly 
in half. 

"Will you say grace?" Hellman asked. 

Casker growled something and 
popped a half in his mouth. Hellman chewed more slowly. The 
sharp taste seemed to explode 
along his disused tastebuds. 

"Not much bulk value." Hellman said. 

Casker didn't answer. He was 
busily studying the red dwarf. 

A S he swallowed the last of 
his radish, Hellman stifled a 
sigh. Their last meal had been 
three days ago ... if two biscuits 
and a cup of water could be called a meal. This radish, now resting in the vast emptiness of their 
stomachs, was the last gram of 
food on board ship. 

"Two planets," Casker said. 
"One's burned to a crisp." 

"Then we'll land on the other." 

Casker nodded and punched a 
deceleration spiral into the ship's 
tape. 

Hellman found himself wondering for the hundredth time 
where the fault had been. Could 
he have made out the food requisitions wrong, when they took on 
supplies at Calao station? After 
all, he had been devoting most 
of his attention to the mining 
equipment. Or had the ground 
crew just forgotten to load those 



last precious cases? 

He drew his belt in to the 
fourth new notch he had punched. 

Speculation was useless. Whatever the reason, they were in a 
jam. Ironically enough, they had 
more than enough fuel to take 
them back to Calao. But they 
would be a pair of singularly 
emaciated corpses by the time 
the ship reached there. 

"We're coming in now," Casker said. 

And to make matters worse, 
this unexplored region of space 
had few suns and fewer planets. 
Perhaps there was a slight possibility of replenishing their 
water supply, but the odds were 
enormous against finding anything they could eat. 

"Look at that place," Casker 
growled. 

Hellman shook himself out of 
his reverie. 

The planet was like a round 
gray - brown porcupine. The 
spines of a million needle-sharp 
mountains glittered in the red 
dwarf's feeble light. And as they 
spiraled lower, circling the planet, the pointed mountains seemed 
to stretch out to meet them. 

"It can't be all mountains," 
Hellman said. 

"It's not." 

Sure enough, there were oceans 
and lakes, out of which thrust 
jagged island-mountains. But no 



34 




 



sign of level land, no hint of 
civilization, or even animal life. 

"At least it's got an oxygen atmosphere," Casker said. 

Their deceleration spiral swept 
them around the planet, cutting 
lower into the atmosphere, braking against it. And still there was 
nothing but mountains and lakes 
and oceans and more mountains. 

On the eighth run, Hellman 
caught sight of a solitary building on a mountain top. Casker 
braked recklessly, and the hull 
glowed red hot. On the eleventh 
run, they made a landing approach. 

"Stupid place to build," Casker muttered. 

The building was doughnutshaped, and fitted nicely over the 
top of the mountain. There was 
a wide, level lip around it, which 
Casker scorched as he landed 
the ship. 

Tj^ROM the air, the building 
had merely seemed big. On 
the ground, it was enormous. 
Hellman and Casker walked up 
to it slowly. Hellman had his 
burner ready, but there was no 
sign of life. 

"This planet must be abandoned," Hellman said almost in a 
whisper. 

"Anyone in his right mind 
would abandon this place," Casker said. "There're enough good 
planets around, without anyone 



trying to live on a needle point." 

They reached the door. Hellman tried to open it and found 
it locked. He looked back at the 
spectacular display of mountains. 

"You know," he said, "when 
this plantt was still in a molten 
state, it must have been affected 
by several gigantic moons that 
are now broken up. The strains, 
external and internal, wrenched 
it into its present spined appearance and — " 

"Come off it," Casker said ungraciously. "You were a librarian 
before you decided to get rich 
on uranium." 

Hellman shrugged his shoulders and burned a hole in the 
doorlock. They waited. 

The only sound on the mountain top was the growling of their 
stomachs. 

They entered. 

The tremendous wedge-shaped 
room was evidently a warehouse 
of sorts. Goods were piled to the 
ceiling, scattered over the floor, 
stacked haphazardly against the 
walls. There were boxes and containers of all sizes and shapes, 
some big enough to hold an elephant, others the size of thimbles. 

Near the door was a dusty pile 
of books. Immediately, Hellman 
bent down to examine them. 

"Must be food somewhere in 
here," Casker said, his face lighting up for the first time in a 



ONE MAN'S POISON 




36 




 



week. He started to open the 
nearest box. 

"This is interesting," Hellman 
said, discarding all the books except one. 

"Let's eat first," Casker said, 
ripping the top off the box. Inside 
was a brownish dust. Casker 
looked at it, sniffed, and made 
a face. 

"Very interesting indeed," 
Hellman said, leafing through 
the book. 

Casker opened a small can, 
which contained a glittering 
green slime. He closed it and 
opened another. It contained a 
dull orange slime. 

"Hmm," Hellman said, still 
reading. 

"Hellman! Will you kindly 
drop that book and help me find 
some food?" 

"Food?" Hellman repeated, 
looking up. "What makes you 
think there's anything to eat 
here? For all you know, this 
could be a paint factory." 

"It's a warehouse!" Casker 
shouted. 

He opened a kidney-shaped 
can and lifted out a soft purple 
stick. It hardened quickly and 
crumpled to dust as he tried to 
smell it. He scooped up a handful of the dust and brought it 
to his mouth. 

"That might be extract of 
strychnine," Hellman said casually. 

1 

ONE MAN'S POISON, 



fiASKER abruptly dropped the 
dust and wiped his hands. 

"After all," Hellman pointed 
out, "granted that this is a warehouse — a cache, if you wish — we 
don't know what the late inhabitants considered good fare. Paris 
green salad, perhaps, with sulphuric acid as dressing." 

"All right," Casker said, "but 
we gotta eat. What're you going 
to do about all this?" He gestured at the hundreds of boxes, cans 
and bottles. 

"The thing to do," Hellman 
said briskly, "is to make a qualitative analysis on four or five 
samples. We could start out with 
a simple titration, sublimate the 
chief ingredient, see if it forms 
a precipitate, work out its molecular makeup from — " 

"Hellman, you don't know 
what you're talking about. 
You're a librarian, remember? 
And I'm a correspondence school 
pilot. We don't know anything 
about titrations and sublimations." 

"I know," Hellman said, "but 
we should. It's the right way to 
go about it." 

"Sure. In the meantime, 
though, just until a chemist 
drops in, what'll we do?" 

"This might help us," Hellman 
said, holding up the book. "Do 
you know what it is?" 

"No," Casker said, keeping a 
tight grip on his patience. 

37 



"It's a pocket dictionary and 
guide to the Helg language." 
"Helg?" 

"The planet we're on. The 
symbols match up with those on 
the boxes." 

Casker raised an eyebrow. 
"Never heard of Helg." 

"I don't believe the planet has 
ever had any contact with 
Earth," Heltman said. "This dictionary isn't Helg-English. It's 
Helg-Aloombrigian." 

Casker remembered that Aloombrigia was the home planet 
of a small, adventurous reptilian 
race, out near the center of the 
Galaxy. 

"How come you can read Aloombrigian?" Casker asked, 

"Oh, being a librarian isn't a 
completely useless profession," 
Hellman said modestly. "In my 
spare time — " 

"Yeah. Now how about — " 

"Do you know," Hellman said, 
"the Aloombrigians probably 
helped the Helgans leave their 
planet and find another. They 
sell services like that. In which 
case, this building very likely is 
a food cache!" 

"Suppose you start translating," Casker suggested wearily, 
"and maybe find us something to 
eat." 

They opened boxes until they 
found a likely-looking substance. 
Laboriously, Hellman translated 
the symbols on it. 



"Got it," he said. "It reads: — 
'Use Sniffners — The Better 
Abrasive.' " 

"Doesn't sound edible," Casker said. 

"I'm afraid not." 

They found another, which 
read: vigroom! fill all your 

STOMACHS, AND FILL THEM RIGHT! 

"What kind of animals do you 
suppose these Helgans were?" 
Casker asked. 

Hellman shrugged his shoulders. 

The next label took almost fifteen minutes to translate. It 

read : aegosel makes your 

THUDRA ATX TIZZY. CONTAINS 
THIRTY ARPS OF RAM STAT PULZ, 
FOR SHELL LUBRICATION. 

"There must be something here 
we can eat," Casker said with a 
note of desperation. 

"I hope so," Hellman replied. 

k T the end of two hours, they 
were no closer. They had 
translated dozens of titles and 
sniffed so many substances that 
their olfactory senses had given 
up in disgust. 

"Let's talk this over," Hellman 
said, sitting on a box marked: 

VORMITISH GOOD AS IT SOUNDS ! 

"Sure," Casker said, sprawling 
out on the floor. "Talk." 

"If we could deduce what kind 
of creatures inhabited this planet, 
we'd know what kind of food 
they ate, and whether it's likely 



38 




 



to be edible for us." 

"All we do know is that they 
wrote a lot of lousy advertising 
copy." 

Hellman ignored that. "What 
kind of intelligent beings would 
evolve on a planet that is all 
mduntains?" 

"Stupid ones!" Casker said. 

That was no help. But Hellman found that he couldn't draw 
any inferences from the mountains. It didn't tell him if the 
late Helgans ate silicates or proteins or iodine-base foods or anything. 

"Now look," Hellman said, 
"we'll have to work this out by 
pure logic — Are you listening to 

me?" 

"Sure," Casker said. 

"Okay. There's an old proverb 
that covers our situation perfectly: 'One man's meat is another 
man's poison.' " 

"Yeah," Casker said. He was 
positive his stomach had shrunk 
to approximately the size of a 
marble. 

"We can assume, first, that 
their meat is our meat." 

Casker wrenched himself away 
from a vision of five juicy roast 
beefs dancing tantalizingly before him. "What if their meat is 
our poison? What then?" 

"Then," Hellman said, "we will 
assume that their poison is our 
meat." 

"And what happens if their 



meat and their poison are our 
poison?" 

"We starve." 

"All right," Casker said, standing up. "Which assumption do 
we start with?" 

"Well, there's no sense in asking for trouble. This is an oxygen 
planet, if that means anything. 
Let's assume that we can eat 
some basic food of theirs. If we 
can't we'll start on their poisons." 

"If we live that long," Casker said. 

Hellman began to translate labels. They discarded such brands 

as AN DROGYNITES DELIGHT and 
VERBEIX — FOR LONGER, CURLIER, 
MORE SENSITIVE ANTENNAE, Until 

they found a small gray box, 
about six inches by three by 
three. It was called valkorin's 

UNIVERSAL TASTE TREAT, FOR ALL 
DIGESTIVE CAPACITIES. 

"This looks as good as any," 
Hellman said. He opened the box. 

Casker leaned over and sniffed. 
"No odor." 

WITHIN the box they found 
a rectangular, rubbery red 
block. It quivered slightly, like 
jelly. 

"Bite into it," Casker said. 

"Me?" Hellman asked. "Why 
not you?" 

"You picked it." 

"I prefer just looking at it," 
Hellman said with dignity. "I'm 
not too hungry." 



ONE MAN'S POISON 



39 



"I'm not either," Casker said. 

They sat on the floor and stared at the jellylike block. After 
ten minutes, Hellman yawned, 
leaned back and closed his eyes. 

"All right, coward," Casker 
said bitterly. "I'll try it. Just remember, though, if I'm poisoned, 
you'll never get off this planet. 
You don't know how to pilot." 

"Just take a little bite, then," 
Hellman advised. 

Casker leaned over and stared 
at the block. Then he prodded it 
with his thumb. 

The rubbery red block giggled. 

"Did you hear that?" Casker 
yelped, leaping back. 

"I didn't hear anything," Hellman said, his hands shaking. "Go 
ahead." 

Casker prodded the block 
again. It giggled louder, this time 
with a disgusting little simper. 

"Okay," Casker said, "what do 
we try next?" 

"Next? What's wrong with 
this?" 

"I don't eat anything that giggles," Casker stated firmly. 

"Now listen to me," Hellman 
said. "The creatures who manufactured this might have been 
trying to create an esthetic sound 
as well as a pleasant shape and 
color. That giggle is probably 
only for the amusement of the 
eater." 

"Then bite into it yourself," 
Casker offered. 



Hellman glared at him, but 
made no move toward the rubbery block. Finally he said, "Let's 
move it out of the way." 

They pushed the block over to 
a corner. It lay there giggling 
softly to itself. 

"Now what?" Casker said. * 

Hellman looked around at the 
jumbled stacks of incomprehensible alien goods. He noticed a 
door on either side of the room. 

"Let's have a look in the other 
sections," he suggested. 

Casker shrugged his shoulders 
apathetically. 

Slowly they trudged to the door 
in the left wall. It was locked and 
Hellman burned it open with the 
ship's burner. 

It was a wedge-shaped room, 
piled with incomprehensible alien 
goods. 

The hike back across the room 
seemed like miles, but they made 
it only slightly out of wind. Hellman blew out the lock and they 
looked in. 

It was a wedge-shaped room, 
piled with incomprehensible alien 
goods. 

"All the same," Casker said 
sadly, and closed the door. 

"Evidently there's a series of 
these rooms going completely 
around the building," Hellman 
said. "I wonder if we should explore them." 

Casker calculated the distance 
around the building, compared it 



40 




 



with his remaining strength, and 
sat dowa heavily on a long gray 
object. 

"Why bother?" he asked. 

TT ELL MAN tried to collect his 
thoughts. Certainly he should 
be able to find a key of some sort, 
a clue that would tell him what 
they could eat. But where was it? 

He examined the object Casker 
was sitting on. It was about the 
size and shape of a large coffin, 
with a shallow depression on top. 
It was made of a hard, corrugated substance. 

"What do you suppose this 
is?" Hellman asked. 

"Does it matter?" 

Hellman glanced at the symbols painted on the side of the 
object, then looked them up in 
his dictionary. 

"Fascinating," he murmured, 
after a while. 

"Is it something to eat?" Casker asked, with a faint glimmering of hope. 

"No, You are sitting on something called THE MOROG CUSTOM 
SUPER TRANSPORT FOR THE DISCRIMINATING HELGAN WHO DESIRES THE BEST IN VERTICAL 

transportation. It's a vehicle!" 

"Oh," Casker said dully. 

"This is important ! Look at it ! 
How does it work?" 

Casker wearily climbed off the 
Morog Custom Super Transport 
and looked it over carefully. He 



traced four almost invisible separations on its four corners. "Retractable wheels, probably, but 
I don't see — " 

Hellman read on. "It says to 
give it three amphus of high-gain 
Integor fuel, then a van of Tonder lubrication, and not to run 
it over three thousand Ruls for 
the first fifty mungus." 

"Let's find something to eat," 
Casker said. 

"Don't you see how important 
this is?" Hellman asked. "This 
could solve our problem. If we 
could deduce the alien logic inherent in constructing this vehicle, we might know the Helgan 
thought pattern. This, in turn, 
would give us an insight into 
their nervous systems, which 
would imply their biochemical 
makeup." 

Casker stood still, trying to 
decide whether he had enough 
strength left to strangle Hellman. 

"For example," Hellman said, 
"what kind of vehicle would be 
used in a place like this? Not one 
with wheels, since everything is 
up and down. Anti-gravity? Perhaps, but what kind of anti-gravity? And why did the inhabitants 
devise a boxlike form instead — " 

Casker decided sadly that he 
didn't have enough strength to 
strangle Hellman, no matter how 
pleasant it might be. Very quietly, he said, "Kindly stop making 
like a scientist. Let's see if there

isn't something we can gulp 
down." 

"All right," Hellman said sulkily. 

CASKER watched his partner 
wander off among the cans, 
bottles and cases. He wondered 
vaguely where Hellman got the 
energy, and decided that he was 
just too cerebral to know when 
he was starving. 

"Here's something," Hellman 
called out, standing in front of a 
large yellow vat. 

"What does it say?" Casker 
asked. 

"Little bit hard to translate. 
But rendered freely, it reads : 
morishille's voozy, with lactoecto added for a new taste sensation, everyone drinks voozy. 
good before and after meals, no 
unpleasant after-effects. good 
for children! the drink of the 
universe!" 

"That sounds good," Casker 
admitted, thinking that Hellman 
might not be so stupid after all. 

"This should tell us once and 
for all if their meat is our meat," 
Hellman said. "This Voozy seems 
to be the closest thing to a universal drink I've found yet." 

"Maybe," Casker said hopefully, "maybe it's just plain 
water!" 

"We'll see." Hellman pried 
open the lid with the edge of the 
burner. 



Within the vat was a crystalclear liquid. * 

"No odor," Casker said, bending over the vat. 

The crystal liquid lifted to 
meet him. 

Casker retreated so rapidly 
that he fell over a box. Hellman 
helped him to his feet, and they 
approached the vat again. As 
they came near, the liquid lifted 
itself three feet into the air and 
moved toward them. 

"What've you done now?" 
Casker asked, moving back carefully. The liquid flowed slowly 
over the side of the vat. It began 
to flow toward him. 

"Hellman!" Casker shrieked. 

Hellman was standing to one 
side, perspiration pouring down 
his face, reading his dictionary 
with a preoccupied frown. 

"Guess I bumbled the translation," he said. 

"Do something!" Casker shouted. The liquid was trying to back 
him into a corner. 

"Nothing I can do," Hellman 
said, reading on. "Ah, here's the 
error. It doesn't say 'Everyone 
drinks Voozy.' Wrong subject. 
'Voozy drinks everyone' That 
tells us something! The Helgans 
must have soaked liquid in 
through their pores. Naturally, 
they would prefer to be drunk, instead of to drink." 

Casker tried to dodge around 
the liquid, but it cut him off

with a merry gurgle. Desperately 
he picked up a small bale and 
threw it at the Voozy. The Voozy 
caught the bale and drank it. 
Then it discarded that and turned 
back to Casker. 

Hellman tossed another box. 
The Voozy drank this one and 
a third and fourth that Casker 
threw in. Then, apparently exhausted, it flowed back into its 
vat. 

Casker clapped down the lid 
and sat on it, trembling violent
iy
"Not so good," Hellman said. 
"We've been taking it for granted 
that the Helgans had eating habits like us. But, of course, it 
doesn't necessarily — *' 

"No, it doesn't. No, sir, it 
certainly doesn't. I guess we can 
see that it doesn't. Anyone can see 
that it doesn't — " 

"Stop that," Hellman ordered 
sternly. "We've no time for hysteria." 

"Sorry." Casker slowly moved 
away from the Voozy vat. 

"I guess we'll have to assume 
that their meat is our poison," 
Hellman said thoughtfully. "So 
now we'll see if their poison is 
our meat." 

Casker didn't say anything. He 
was wondering what would have 
happened if the Voozy had drunk 
him. 

In the corner, the rubbery block 
was still giggling to itself. 



"IVOW here's a likely-looking 
poison," Hellman said, half 
an hour later. 

Casker had recovered completely, except for an occasional 
twitch of the lips. 

"What does it say?" he asked. 

Hellman rolled a tiny tube in 
the palm of his hand. "It's called 
Pvastkin's Plugger. The label 
reads: warning! highly dangerous! pvastkin's plugger is 
designed to fill holes or cracks 
of not more than two cubic 
vims. however — the plugger is 
not to be eaten under any circumstances, the active ingredient, ramotol, which makes 
pvastkin's so excellent a plugger renders it highly dangerous when taken internally." 

"Sounds great," Casker said. 
"It'll probably blow us sky-high." 

"Do you have any other suggestions?" Hellman asked. 

Casker thought for a moment. 
The food of Helg was obviously 
unpalatable for humans. So perhaps was their poison . . . but 
wasn't starvation better than this 
sort of thing? 

After a moment's communion 
with his stomach, he decided that 
starvation was nor better. 

"Go ahead," he said. 

Hellman slipped the burner 
under his arm and unscrewed the 
top of the little bottle. He shook 
it 

Nothing happened. 



ONE MAN'S POISON 



43 



"It's got a seal," Casker pointed out. 

Hellman punctured the seal 
with his fingernail and set the 
bottle on the floor. An evil-smelling green froth began to bubble 
out. 

Hellman looked dubiously at 
the froth. It was congealing into 
a glob and spreading over the 
floor. 

"Yeast, perhaps," he said, 
gripping the burner tightly. 

"Come, come. Faint heart never 
filled an empty stomach." 

"I'm not holding you back" 
Hellman said. 

The glob swelled to the size 
of a man's head. 

"How long is that supposed to 
go on?" Casker asked. 

"Well," Hellman said, "it's advertised as a Plugger. I suppose 
that's what it does — expands to 
plug up holes." 

"Sure. But how much?" 

"Unfortunately, I don't know 
how much two cubic vims are. 
But it can't go on much — " 

Belatedly, they noticed that 
the Plugger had filled almost a 
quarter of the room and was 
showing no signs of stopping. 

**We should have believed the 
label!" Casker yelled to him, 
across the spreading glob. "It is 
dangerous!" 

As the Plugger produced more 
surface, it began to accelerate in 
its growth. A sticky edge touched 



Hellman, and he jumped back, 
"Watch out!" 

He couldn't reach Casker,. on 
the other side of the gigantic 
sphere of blob. Hellman tried to 
run around", but the Plugger had 
spread, cutting the room in half. 
It began to swell toward the 
walls. 

"Run for it!" Hellman yelled, 
and rushed to the door behind 
him. 

HE flung it open just as the expanding glob reached him. 
On the other side of the room, 
he heard a door slam shut. Hellman didn't wait any longer. He 
sprinted through and slammed 
the door behind him. 

He stood for a moment, panting, the burner in his hand. He 
hadn't realized how weak he was. 
That sprint had cut his reserves 
of energy dangerously close to 
the collapsing point. At least 
Casker had made it, too, though. 
But he was still in trouble. 
The Plugger poured merrily 
through the blasted lock, into the 
room. Hellman tried a practice 
shot on it, but the Plugger was 
evidently impervious ... as, he 
realized, a good plugger should 
be. 

It was showing no signs of fatigue. 

Hellman hurried tq^the far 
wall. The door was locked, as 
the others had been, so he burned 



44 




 



out the lock and went through. 

How far could the glob expand? How much was two cubic 
vims? Two cubic miles, perhaps? 
For all he knew, the Plugger was 
used to repair faults in the crusts 
of planets. 

In the next room, Hellman 
stopped to catch his breath. He 
remembered that the building was 
circular. He would burn his way 
through tne remaining doors and 
join Casker. They would burn 
their way outside and . . . 

Casker didn't have a burner! 

Hellman turned white with 
shock. Casker had made it into 
the room on the right, because 
they had burned it open earlier. 
The Plugger was undoubtedly 
oozing into that room, through 
the shattered lock . . . and Casker 
couldn't get out! The Plugger 
was on his left, a locked door on 
his right! 

Rallying his remaining 
strength, Hellman began to run. 
Boxes seemed to get in his way 
purposefully, tripping him, slowing him down. He blasted the 
next door and hurried on to the 
next. And the next. And the next. 

The Plugger couldn't expand 
completely into Casker's room ! 

Or could it? 

The wedge-shaped rooms, each 
a segment of a circle, seemed to 
stretch before him forever, a 
jumbled montage of locked doors, 
alien goods, more doors, more 



goods. Hellman fell over a crate, 
got to his feet and fell again. He 
had reached the limit of his 
strength, and passed it. But Casker was his friend. 

Besides, without a pilot, he'd 
never get off the place. 

Hellman struggled through two 
more rooms on trembling legs 
and then collapsed in front of a 
third. 

"Is that you, Hellman?" he 
heard Casker ask, from the other 
side of the door. 

"You all right?" Hellman managed to gasp. 

"Haven't much room in here," 
Casker said, "but the Plugger's 
stopped growing. Hellman, get 
me out of here ('* 

TTELLMAN lay on the floor 
panting. "Moment," he said. 

"Moment, hell!" Casker shouted. "Get me out. I've found 
water!" 

"What? How?" 

"Get me out of here!" 

Hellman tried to stand up, but 
his legs weren't cooperating. 
"What happened?" he asked. 

"When I saw that glob filling 
the room, I figured I'd try to 
start up the Super Custom Transport. Thought maybe it could 
knock down the door and get me 
out. So I pumped it full of highgain Integor fuel." 

"Yes?" Hellman said, still trying to get his legs under control. 



ONE MAN'S POISON 



45 



"That Super Custom Transport is an animal, Hellman! And 
the Integor fuel is water! Now 
get me out!" 

Hellman lay back with a contented sigh. If he had had a little 
more time, he would have worked 
out the whole thing himself, by 
pure logic. But it was all very 
apparent now. The most efficient 
machine to go over those vertical, 
razor-sharp mountains would be 
an animal, probably with retractable suckers. It was kept in hibernation between trips; and if 
it drank water, the other products designed for it would be 
palatable, too. Of course they 
still didn't know much about the 
late inhabitants, but undoubtedly .. . 

"Burn down that door!" Casker shrieked, his voice breaking. 

Hellman was pondering the 
irony of it all. If one man's meat 
— and his poison — are your poison, then try eating something 
else. So simple, really. 

But there was one thing that 
still bothered him. 

"How did you know it was an 
Earth-type animal?" he asked. 

"Its breath, stupid! It inhales 
and exhales and smells as if it's 
eaten onions!" There was a sound 
bf cans falling and bottles shat


tering. "Now hurry!" 

"What's wrong?" Hellman asked, finally getting to his feet and 
poising the burner. 

"The Custom Super Transport. 
It's got me cornered behind a 
pile of cases. Hellman, it seems 
to think that I'm its meat!" 

Broiled with the burner — well 
done for Hellman, medium rare 
for Casker — it was their meat, 
with enough left over for the 
trip back to Calao.

were even more afraid to go back 
alone. 

"So we moved along under almost unbearable heat. The outline of the distant mountains, 
even though blurred by the heat, 
slowly grew more distinct. We 
were still pushing forward 
through the shoulder-high grass 
while the sun was sinking in the 
west when I suddenly broke out 
of the grass into a clearing. 

"It was a very strange clearing — the grass simply stopped 
along a well-defined arc. On the 
bare ground were the bleached 
bones of animals and at a distance something that looked like 
a human skull. So it was true, 
after all. 

"Because in the center of this 
inexplicable and somehow ghastly hundred-yard clearing there 
stood The Tree . . 

I know you are quite sure that 
you have read this before, but 
right now you have trouble placing it. The reason is simple: you 
have read this in various stories 
and in Sunday Supplements 
quite a while back and maybe 
even in a book. 

The tree in the center of the 
clearing is, of course, deadly. It 
is either so poisonous that birds 
flying over it drop to the ground, 
dead, or else it is actively carnivorous. And because editors of 
Sunday Supplements used to suspect that their readers might not 



know what "carnivorous" means, 
the tree was dubbed "man-eating." 

Depending on the version, the 
natives — those of Mindanao in 
one— either shun it or else — those 
of Madagascar in another — they 
worship it and appease it with 
victims of which the white man 
must be kept unaware. The best 
way to combine both requirements is, naturally, to feed the 
white rnan to the tree, which preserves the secret and keeps the 
tree happy. 

A S far as I can tell, there 
haven't been any man-eating 
trees around for a number of 
years. The last one I know of was 
the blood-sucking tree of Mindanao of 1925 which did not live 
long in the public prints. The 
man-eating tree of Madagascar, 
on the other hand, is alleged to 
have nourished for almost half a 
century. But even this hardy 
(though tropical) perennial was 
not the first, for the myth of 
deadly trees is much older than 
that. In fact, it seems to have 
originated during the so-called 
age of exploration, when Africa 
was circumnavigated for the first 
time since the Phoenicians and 
when the Western Hemisphere 
was discovered. 

I have a notion — for which I 
have no proof at the moment — 
that the deadly tree was origin

ally a philosophical invention. 
Everything was contrasted by its 
opposite: light and darkness, 
heat and cold, life and death. 
The opposite of the royal lion 
was the deadly basilisk which 
could kill by a glance. Since the 
Bible spoke of a Tree of Life, 
it must have seemed at least 
likely that there was a Tree of 
Death, too. This belief seemed 
confirmed when travelers' tales 
followed hard upon the heels of 
the conquest of Central America. 
In the wonderland of the West 
Indies, there actually grew such 
a deadly tree. I don't know just 
how it was called at first, but 
later it was referred to very 
guardedly and with much awe as 
the Manzanilla tree. Scientists 
and especially botanists never 
mentioned it, yet it managed to 
survive as a literary tradition. 
The story reached its climax less 
than a century ago. 

Giacomo Meyerbeer, born in 
Berlin in 1791 as Jakob Beer, returned to his native city in 1842 
as musical boss of the Royal 
Opera, after living in Paris for 
two decades. But the Herr Generalmusikdirektar was not only 
supposed to conduct operas; he 
was also expected to compose 
some, and he did. One of his 
great successes was L'Africaine; 
in the last act, the heroine decides to die, which she does in a 
decorous manner by reposing in 



the shadow of a Manzanilla tree. 
When the opera was first performed in 1865, the assembled 
Berliners found this end most 
touching- — and not a single one of 
them thought of inquiring whether there was such a tree. To some 
extent, the story died because nobody else dared use it any more, 
for fear of being accused of plagiarism. 

But meanwhile another Tree 
of Death had made its appearance: the Upas tree. Later researchers have found what they 
believe to be the first appearance 
of this vegetable devil; an article 
in the London Magazine in 1783. 
Its author was a Dr. Foersch, 
who had lived for a number of 
years as a surgeon in Samarang. 
On his return, he told of the marvels of Java, among them the 
Upas tree, so poisonous that 
birds could not fly over it and 
animals could not pass near it. 
"All animal life within a range 
of 15 miles of such a tree 
will surely perish," Dr. Foersch 
stated. 

¥F that assertion had remained 
in the London Magazine, it 
would probably have been buried and forgotten. But Erasmus 
Darwin, the grandfather of 
Charles Darwin, was taken in 
and repeated the story in one of 
his works. This unfortunate fact 
did have one good aspect, at 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



least. Because Erasmus Darwin 
had mentioned it, people who 
went to Java looked for it. And 
they turned up with a tree which 
is now listed in botanical works 
as Antiaris toxicaria; -in Java, it 
is commonly referred to as the 
Anchar tree or, by the natives, 
as the Ipoh. 

It is a straight, slender tree, 
60 to 80 feet tall, and it is poisonous. However, it can be approached without danger, as is 
shown by the fact that the natives cut holes into it to get its 
sap, which they use for poisoning arrows and other weapons. 
The sap tastes like quinine and 
contains a poison that is rather 
powerful if it gets into the body 
through a cut or wound, since 
it acts on the heart muscle and 
the central nervous system. But 
don't worry if your seafaring 
uncle brought poisoned arrows 
from Java. After about eight 
weeks, the poison stops being 
lethal. 

The strangest part of the whole 
story is that old Dr. Foersch 
may not have sold a deliberate 
hoax to his London editor, but 
may have been honestly mistaken. Java is very strongly volcanic and there are areas, local 
depressions, which are full of volcanic carbon dioxide. Because 
this colorless and odorless gas is 
much heavier than air, it can fill 
a depression like water, forcing 



all the breathable air out. Small 
animals that enter such a place 
suddenly collapse, as if struck by 
lightning (or as if poisoned). Actually, they have "drowned" in 
carbon dioxide. Nobody had any 
idea of carbon dioxide in 1783 
when Dr. Foersch told his story. 

But there were areas on Java 
where animals collapsed and died 
and there was a poisonous tree 
on the islands. 

While the Manzanilla tree of 
operatic fame and the Upas tree 
of Java were merely supposed to 
be poisonous and as little concerned with the fate of the accidental victims as a poison ivy 
vine, the third in the succession of 
deadly trees had a purpose in 
mind. It was an active killer, intent on feeding the vegetable 
equivalent of a stomach. I am 
now speaking of the "Man-eating 
tree of Madagascar" which was 
discussed at great length in a 
book with the title ''Madagascar 
— Land of the Man-Eating Tree" 
by one Chase Salmon Osborn, 
Ll.D.. published in New York in 
1924. 

I do not claim to be able to 
judge the chapters on tribal customs, native history, etc., of this 
book. As for the chapter on zoology, 1 do know that it is horribly 
amateurish , incredibly careless 
as to detail and poorly written. 
The chapter pn the botany of 
Madagascar is no better and in 



50 




 



general I feel that the proverbial 
"grain of salt" isn't enough. 

|"VSBORN'S book claims that 
"-^ the man-eating tree of Madagascar was first described in 
1 878 in a letter by a traveler 
named Carl Liche to a Dr. Omelius Fredlowski (neither of whom 
is listed in Webster's Biographical Dictionary). The book also 
says that the report appeared 
first in a German magazine in 
1878 and two years later in the 
New York World. I haven't had 
the time to check either and 
therefore cannot vouch for this. 

The alleged letter says that its 
author visited a primitive tribe 
in the interior of Madagascar 
which is called the Mkodo tribe. 
These people are said to be ignorant of clothing and have no 
native religion or tribal rites except the worship of the tree. After 
completely failing to identify the 
place and merely stating that it 
was a valley which could not 
have been more than 400 feet 
above sea level, "Carl Liche" 
claims to have reached a lake 
from which issued a small river. 

But now I feel I should quote 
verbatim : 

"The sluggish canal-like stream 
here wound slowly by, and in a 
bare spot in its bend was the 
most singular of trees. I will try 
to describe it to you. If you can 
imagine a pineapple eight feet 



high and thick in proportion, 
resting upon its base and denuded of leaves, you will have a good 
idea of the trunk of the tree 
which, however, was not the color of a pineapple but a dark 
dingy brown and apparently as 
hard as iron. From the apex of 
this truncated cone (at least two 
feet in diameter) eight leaves 
hung sheer to the ground, like 
doors swung back on their hinges. 

"These leaves were about 11 or , 
12 feet long and shaped very 
much like the leaves of the American agave or century plant (did 
he think this was the same? — W. 
L.). They were two feet through 
at their thickest point and three 
feet wide, tapering to a sharp 
point that looked like a cow's 
horn; very convex on the outer 
(but now under) surface and on 
the under (now upper) surface 
slightly concave. This concave 
face was thickly set with strong 
thorny hooks . . ." 

IN addition to the trunk and 
the eight spiked leaves, the 
plant had a large number of 
green tendrils "tapering from 4 
inches to 1/2 inch in diameter, 
yet stretched out stiffly as iron 
rods," a hollow on top filled with 
"a clear treacly liquid, honey 
sweet and possessed of violently 
intoxicating qualities" and, to 
round out the picture, "six white 
almost transparent palpi reared 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 



themselves towards the sky, 
twirling and twisting with a marvellous incessant motion. 

"Thin as reeds and frail as 
quills, apparently they were yet 
five or six feet tall a'nd were so 
constantly and vigorously in motion that they made me shudder 
in spite of myself, with their suggestion of serpents flayed, yet 
dancing upon their tails." 

The alleged letter then goes on 
to tell that one of the native women was forced to climb the tree 
and that, all at once, the green 
hard tendrils wrapped themselves 
around her like pythons. "And 
now the great leaves rose slowly 
and stiffly, approached one another and closed about the dead 
and hampered victim with the 
silent force of a hydraulic press 
and the ruthless purpose of a 
thumb screw." For ten days the 
big leaves remained upright. 
."Then, when I came one morning, they were prone again, the 
tendrils stretched, the palpi floating and nothing but a white skull 
at the foot of the tree to remind 
me of the sacrifice that had taken 
place there." 

Well! All I can say is that if 
there were a carnivorous plant 
of a size to catch and kill a victim the size of a man, it certainly 
would not function as described. 

As I said, I have not checked 
whether the letter actually appeared in the Carlsmhe Scientific 



Journal in 1878 or in the New 
York World in 1880. I doubt it. 
All the references to the man-eating tree of Madagascar appeared 
after 1924; i.e., after the publication of Dr. C. S. Osborn's book. 
The whole thing may have been 
a one-shot hoax, rather than a 
literary tradition. If it was such 
a hoax, it certainly was successful 
for a time. 

HOMEMADE PSEUDO-CELLS 

LAST month, when I discussed 
research work devoted to the 
origin and definition of life, I 
felt tempted to insert a few words 
about experiments that aimed at 
cell imitation. But I decided to 
postpone this for a month so 
that nobody might be confused, 
especially since there is one case 
on record where a researcher (a 
Russian physician with the very 
un- Russian name of Martin 
Kuckuck) mistook his pseudocells for actual artificial life, 
loudly proclaiming that he had 
solved the "secret of spontaneous 
generation." 

Perhaps the simplest of the 
imitation cells is the one found 
by Prof. Johannes Traube. Take 
a shallow glass dish and nil it 
with a solution of tannin. Then 
add one drop of old-fashioned 
carpenter's glue. Immediately a 
tough skin will form around the 
drop of glue. But the skin is not 



52 




 



impervious to water; the glue 
drop absorbs water from the solution, "grows" and finally bursts 
the skin. Of course a new skin 
forms immediately, which then 
again grows too tight for the 
water absorbed and so forth. 

Even more astonishing in appearance is the "dividing cell" 
devised by the French physician 
Stephan Leduc. All it involves is 
a few drops of salt water on a 
piece of glass. One drop, placed 
in the center, consists of a weak 
salt solution to which a dye has 
been added. The two other drops, 
placed to the right and left of 
the first, contain no dye, but are 
somewhat stronger salt solutions. 
Then you make the three drops 
touch and observe the result with 
good magnifying glass. The result looks precisely like pictures 
of a real cell in division with 
"chromosomes" splitting off in 
both directions. 

Or maybe you would like to 
see an ameba eating a small alga. 
Use a sliver of glass, about a 
quarter of an inch in length, 
coat it with shellac, put it in very 
shallow water and add a drop of 
chloroform. (See diagram). The 
chloroform drop will exhibit the 
most lifelike properties, finally 
throwing out the "indigestible" 
glass. 

Finally, there are the "colpoids" of Prof. Alfonso L. Herrera of Mexico. The "nutrient"

of the "colpoids" is a mixture of 
olive oil and gasoline, two parts 
of gasoline (by volume) for one 
part of olive oil. The "cells" are 
a solution of washing soda in 
water that might be dyed to show 
things more clearly. The principle is the same as the cell of 
Prof. Traube — namely, osmotic 
pressure — but Herrera's are more 
active by far. They will move 
rapidly across the oil -gasoline 
"lake," pursue each other, eat 
each other and behave, in general, like irritated and hungry animalcules. 

No, it doesn't prove anything 
directly. It merely shows that 
those physical forces that are 
utilized by an actually living cell 
can also put on a fine show by 
themselves. 

MOTOR OR ENGINE? 

i~\NE day, several years ago, 
after a lecture of mine on 
rockets and high altitude research, a gentleman came up to 
the platform and suggested with 
great politeness that I had made 
a mistake. An understandable 
and pardonable mistake since 
English is not my native tongue, 
but a mistake just the same. Of 
course I asked just what I had 
done wrong. "Well, sir," he said, 
"all through your lecture you 
spoke of rocket motors when you 
should have said engines." I ask


ed why a rocket should have an 
engine. He didn't know, but insisted that it was not a motor. 
I then asked what was the difference between an engine and a 
motor. He couldn't explain, but 
maintained that there was one. 

Since then, I have had several 
such conversations and one afternoon, when I had time, I went 
after that elusive difference between motor and engine, digging 
through encyclopedias, dictionaries, books on word origins and 
everything else that seemed pertinent. 

The situation is about as silly 
as it can possibly be; it is best 
(if inadvertently) summed up by 
the first sentence in the article 
Motor-Boats of the Encyclopaedia Britannica, which says 
that a "motor-boat is a small 
vessel propelled by a gasoline engine." But if the motor-boat's 
gasoline engine is detachable, it 
promptly becomes an outboard 
motor. Similarly, with the aid of 
half a dozen or so engines in 
trucks, a company of soldiers is 
motorized. And every Englishman who can afford one drives a 
motorcar. Americans don't — they 
ride in automobiles, except 
younger ones who have motorbikes. 

Linguistically, there can be no 
doubt that the right word is 
"motor," which is simply the Latin word for "mover." Trucks, 



54 




 



cars, motorboats, airplanes and 
rockets indubitably move, being 
moved by the thing many people 
insist on calling "engine." 

As for the word "engine," it 
is supported by tradition only. 
Prior to the invention of the 
steam engine, the word "engine" 
was used in a sense which is expressed in present-day English 
by the words "contrivance" or 
"contraption." Remember that 
Domingo Gonzales, the hero of 
The Man in the Moone (1629), 
builds himself an "engine" to 
escape from St. Helena. It is — 
well, a contraption with a saddle 
at one end and harnesses for a 
dozen or so birds at the other. 
The word "engine" is derived 
from Latin, too, from ingenium, 
the word that also produced 
"ingenuity." The steam engine, 
when it came along, was just a 
special contrivance involving 
steam. 

! I know that this little dissertation is not going to change usage. 
Mechanics in garages will go on 
fixing engines, airplane pilots and 
operating personnel will continue 
to talk of the left outboard engine and so on. But I want at 
least to point out that there is 
no difference between "engine" 
and "motor" and that the latter 
is actually the better word. It 
merely has the drawback that it 
prevents the people who operate 
it from calling themselves "en


gineers" rather than "motorists," 
ANY QUESTIONS? 

What is the "circular velocity" 
of a body and how is it related 
to the escape velocity? 

Alexander E. Tiflis 
East Morningside Drive 
Atlanta, Georgia. 

The "circular velocity" of 
a planet is the velocity a body 
has to attain to describe a circular orbit around the planet. 
In the case of Earth, this 
amounts to 4.943 miles per 
second at sea level. Theoretically a projectile or rocket, having this speed, would circle 
Earth indefinitely, but in reality it would crash very rapidly 
because of air resistance. For 
practical reasons, therefore, the 
-circular velocity is always specified for a given distance or 
height, by saying that the circular velocity for a height of 
x miles is y miles per sec. You 
can calculate the circular velocity very easily according to 
the formula Vg( r +h) where 
r is the radius of the planet, 
while h is the additional distance above sea level. 

If you fired a projectile 
(neglecting air resistance) vertically with circular velocity, it 
would rise to a distance of one 
planet radius above the surface. The following table leads

up to the second part of your 
question. Circular velocity is 
denoted by v c .

7 r " V » 1.320

The last line in this table 
denotes "escape velocity" and 
since 1.414 is the square root 
of 2, the relationship between 
circular velocity v.. and escape 
velocity v p is 



v p = v e \/2 

and the numerical value of v p 
is 6.9655 miles per sec. 

In a 20-year old book which 
came into my possession, I found 
mention of a number called duodecitlion. I would like to know 
whether such a number is still in 
use and how large it is. 

Carl R. White 
568 Mt. View Terrace 
Dunellen, N. J. 
Names like sextillian, decillion, duodecillion, etc., are very 
rarely used nowadays, mostly 
because of the misunderstand


ings that might be caused by 
their use. Unfortunately, Europeans and Americans could 
never reach an agreement on 
how to name figures larger 
than one million. Up to that 
point they agree, but the Americans call 1000 million a billion, while Europeans call the 
same figure a milliard and reserve the word billion for a 
million million. (You may have 
noticed that I never say "billion" but always 1000 million, 
partly because this is correct 
mathematically and partly because of our foreign editions.) 
Similarly, the Americans use 
the "next higher name 11 after 
adding three zeros to a figure; 
the Europeans, after adding six 
zeros. Having progressed in 
either manner ten times, starting at a million, you get a det- ill ion; after twelve times, a 
duodecillion. To avoid misunderstandings, large figures are 
now written in this manner: 



2x10* 

which means two million. You 
can remember this system most 
easily by saying that the exponential figure is the number 
of zeros following a one. 

In the book The Universe and 
Dr. Einstein, Lincoln Barnett, its 
author, says: "Contrary to popu

lar belief the moon does not revolve around the earth; they revolve around each other, or more 
precisely around a common center of gravity." Can you tell me 
if this is true? 

Peter J. McLean 
4241 Victoria Dr. 
Vancouver B. C. 
The answer is yes, Earth and 
Moon revolve around a common center of gravity. If they 
were both of equal mass, that 
common center of gravity, technically known as the barycenter, would be halfway between 
them. In the case of two bodies 
of unequal mass, the barycenter is close to the larger of the 
two bodies. In the case of the 
Earth-Moon system, the masses 
are so unequal that the barycenter is comparatively close to 
the center of the bigger mass; 
i.e., the Earth. It is 2900 miles 
from the Earth's center and 
since the radius of the Earth is 
3950 miles, the barycenter is 



roughly 1000 miles below the 
surface. 

What would happen if two 
galaxies collided? 

Peter Kreeit 
26 Richardson Ave. 
Haledon, N. J. 
Let's see: in our section of 
the Galaxy, the average distance between stars seems to be 
of the order of 25 million million miles. The diameter of a 
star is rarely more than two 
million miles, so the distance 
is 12.5 million star diameters. 
Even in the denser sections of 
a galaxy, the average distance 
is still several thousand star 
diameters. It is, therefore, possible that two galaxies might 
"collide" by going through 
each other without a single star 
collision. In reality, there might 
be some very close approaches, 
but the overall picture would 
be that nothing happens at all.

He wanted to help people on all worlds and 
all ships between . . . and his plan was a warm 
and friendly one. Maybe a bit too friendly! 



U/^ OME in - And 
■ shut the door." 

"I beg your pardon, 
sir?" The Skipper never invited 
anyone in — not to his quarters. 
His office, yes, but not here. 

He made an abrupt gesture, 
and I came in and closed the 
door. It was about as luxurious 
as a compartment on a spaceship 
can get. I tried not to goggle at 
it as if it was the first time I 
had ever seen it, just because it 
was the first time I had ever seen 
it. 

I sat down. 

He opened his mouth, closed 
it, forced the tip of his tongue 
through his thin lips. He licked 
them and glared at me. I'd never 
seen the Iron Man like this. I decided that the best thing to say 
would be nothing, which is what 
I said. 

He pulled a deck of cards out 



of the top-middle drawer and 
slid them across the desk. "Deal." 
I said, "I Id — " 

"And don't say you beg my 
pardon !" he exploded. 

Well, all right. If the skipper 
wanted a cozy game of gin rummy to while away the parsecs, far 
be it from me to. . . I shuffled. 
Six years under this cold-blooded, fish-eyed automatic computer 
with eyebrows, and this was the 
first time that he — 

"Deal," he said. I looked up at 
him. "Draw, five-card draw. You 
do play draw poker, don't you, 
Purser?" 

"Yes, sir." I dealt and put 
down the pack. I had three threes 
and a couple of court cards. The 
skipper scowled at his hand and 
threw down two. He glared at. 
me again. 

I said, "I got three of a kind, 
sir."

COSTELLO, HERO

TTE let his cards go as if they 
no longer existed, slammed 
out of his chair and turned his 
back to me. He tilted his head 
back and stared up at the seeit-all, with its complex- of speed, 
time, position and distance-run 
coordinates. Borinquen, our destination planet, was at spitting 
distance — only a day or so off — 
and Earth was a long, long way 
behind. I heard a sound and 
dropped my eyes. The Skipper's 
hands were locked behind him, 
squeezed together so hard that 
they crackled. 

"Why didn't you draw?" he 
grated. 

"I beg your—'* 

"When I played poker — and I 
used to play a hell of a lot of 
poker — as I recall it, the dealer 
would find out how many cards 
each player wanted after the 
deal and give him as many as he 
discarded. Did you ever hear of 
that, Purser?" 

"Yes, sir, I did." 

"You did" He turned around. 
I imagine he had been scowling 
this same way at the see-it-all, 
and I wondered why it was he 
hadn't shattered the cover glass. 

M Why, then. Purser," he demanded, "did you show your 
three of a kind without discarding, without drawing — without, 
mister, asking me how many 
cards I might want?" 

I thought about it. "I — we — I 



mean, sir, we haven't been playing poker that way lately." 

"You've been playing poker 
without drawing!" He sat down 
again and beamed that glare at 
me again. "And who changed the 
rules?" 

"I don't know, sir. We just — 
that's the way we've been playing." 

He nodded thoughtfully. "Now 
tell me something, Purser. How 
much time did you spend in the 
galley during the last watch?" 

"About an hour, sir." 

"About an hour." 

"Well, sir," I explained hurriedly, "it was my turn." 

He said nothing, and it suddenly occurred to me that these 
galley -watches weren't in the 
ship's orders. 

I said quickly, "It isn't against 
your orders to stand such a 
watch, is it, sir?" 

"No," he said, "it isn't." His 
voice was so gentle, it was ugly. 
■"Tell me, Purser, doesn't Cooky 
mind these galley-watches?" 

"Oh, no, sir! He's real pleased 
about it." I knew he was thinking 
about the size of the galley. It 
was true that two men made 
quite a crowd in a place like that. 
I said, "That way, he knows everybody can trust him." 

"You mean that way you know 
he won't poison you." 

"Well — yes, sir." 

"And tell me," he said, his 



60 




 



voice even gentler, "who suggested he might poison you?" 

"I really couldn't say, Captain. 
It's just sort of something that 
came up. Cooky doesn't mind," 
I added. "If he's watched all the 
time, he knows nobody's going to 
suspect him. It's all right." 

A GAIN he repeated my words. 

"It's all right." I wished he 
wouldn't, I wished he'd stop 
looking at me like that. "How 
long," he asked, "has it been 
customary for the deck officer to 
bring a witness with him when he 
takes over the watch?" 

"I really couldn't say, sir. 
That's out of my department." 

"You couldn't say. Now think 
hard, Purser. Did you ever stand 
galley -watches, or see deck-officers bring witnesses with them 
when they relieve the bridge, or 
see draw poker played without 
drawing — before this trip?" 

"Well, no, sir. I don't think I 
have. I suppose we just never 
thought of it before." 

"We never had Mr. Costello as 
a passenger before, did we?" 

"No, sir." 

I thought for a moment he 
was going to say something else, 
but he didn't, just: "Very well, 
Purser. That will be alL" 

I went out and started back 
aft, feeling puzzled and sort of 
upset. The Skipper didn't have 
to hint things like that about Mr. 



Costello. Mr. Costello was a very 
nice man. Once, the Skipper had 
picked a fight with Mr. Costello. 
They'd shouted at each other 
in the dayroom. That is, the 
Skipper had shouted — Mr. Costello never did. Mr. Costello was 
as good-natured as they come. 
A big good-natured soft-spoken 
man, with the kind of face they 
call open. Open and honest. He'd 
once been a Triumver back on 
Earth — the youngest ever appointed, they said. 

You wouldn't think such an 
easygoing man was as smart as 
that. Triumvers are usually lifetime appointees, but Mr. Costello wasn't satisfied. Had to keep 
moving, you know. Learning all 
the time, shaking hands all 
around, staying close to the people. He loved people. 

I don't know why the Skipper 
couldn't get along with him. 
Everybody else did. And besides 
— Mr. Costello didn't play poker; 
why should he care one way or 
the other how we played it? He 
didn't eat the galley food — he 
had his own stock in his cabin — 
so what difference would it make 
to him if the cook poisoned anyone? Except, of course, that he 
cared about us. People — he liked 
people. 

Anyway, it's better to play 
poker without the draw. Poker's 
a good game with a bad reputation. And where do you suppose 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



61 



it gets the bad reputation? From 
cheaters. And how do people 
cheat at poker? Almost never 
when they deal. It's when they 
pass out cards after the discard. 
That's when a shady dealer 
knows what he holds, and he 
knows what to give the others so 
he can win. All right, remove the 
discard and you remove ninetenths of the cheaters. Remove 
the cheaters and the honest men 
can trust each other. 

That's what Mr. Costello used 
to say, anyhow. Not that he cared 
one way or the other for himself. He wasn't a gambling man. 

T WENT into the dayroom and 
there was Mr. Costello with 
the Third Officer. He gave me a 
big smile and a wave, so I went 
over. 

"Come on, sit down, Purser," 
he said. "I'm landing tomorrow. 
Won't have much more chance to 
talk to you." 

I sat down. The Third snapped 
shut a book he'd been holding 
open on the table and sort of got 
it out of sight. 

Mr. Costello laughed at him. 
"Go ahead. Third, show the Purser. You can trust him — he's a 
good man. I'd be proud to be 
shipmates with the Purser." 

The Third hesitated and then 
raised the book from his lap. It 
was the Space Code and expanded Rules of the Road. Every li


censed officer has to bone up on 
it a lot, to get his license. But it's 
not the kind of book you ordinarily kill time with. 

"The Third here was showing 
me all about what a captain can 
and can't do," said Mr. Costello. 

"Well, you asked me to," the 
Third said. 

"Now just a minute," said Mr. 
Costello rapidly, "now just a 
minute." He had a way of doing 
that sometimes. It was part of 
him, like the thinning hair on 
top of his head and the big 
smile and the way he had of 
cocking his head to one side and 
asking you what it was you just 
said, as if he didn't hear so well. 
"Now just a minute, you wanted 
to show me this material, didn't 
you?" 

"Well, yes, Mr. Costello," the 
Third said. 

"You're going over the limitations of a spacemaster's power of 
your own free will, aren't you?" 

"Well," said the Third, "I 
guess so. Sure." 

"Sure," Mr. Costello repeated 
happily. "Tell the Purser the 
part you just read to me." 

"The one you found in the 
book?" 

"You know the one. You read 
it out your own self, didn't you?" 

"Oh," said the Third. He looked at me — sort of uneasily, I 
thought — and reached for the 
book. 



62 




 



Mr. Costello put his hand on 
it. "Oh, don't bother looking it 
up," he said. "You can remember 
it." 

"Yeah,. I guess I do," the Third 
admitted. "It's a sort of safeguard against letting a skipper's 
power go to his head, in case it 
ever does. Suppose a time comes 
when a captain begins to act up, 
and the crew gets the idea that 
a lunatic has taken over the 
bridge. Well, something has to 
be done about it. The crew has 
the power to appoint one officer 
and send him up to the Captain 
for an accounting. If the Skipper 
refuses, or if the crew doesn't like 
his accounting, then they have 
the right to confine him to his 
quarters and take over the ship." 

"I think I heard about that," 
I said. "But the Skipper has 
rights, too. I mean the crew has 
to report everything by spaceradio the second it happens, and 
then the Captain has a full hearing along with the crew at the 
next port." 

T1MR. Costello looked at us and 
-J-*-*- shook his big head, full of 
admiration. When Mr. Costello 
thought you were good, it made 
you feel good all over. 

The Third looked at his watch 
and got up. "I got to relieve the 
bridge. Want to come along; Purser?" 

"I'd like to talk to him for a 



while," Mr. Costello said. "Do 
you suppose you could get somebody else for a witness?" 

"Oh, sure, if you say so," said 
the Third. 

"But you're going to get someone." 

"Absolutely," said the Third. 

"Safest ship I was ever on," 
said Mr. Costello. "Gives a fellow a nice feeling to know that 
the watch is never going to get 
the orders wrong." 

I thought so myself and wondered why we never used to do it 
before. I watched the Third leave 
and stayed where I was, feeling 
good, feeling safe, feeling glad 
that Mr. Costello wanted to talk 
to me. And me just a Purser, him 
an ex-Triumver. 

Mr. Costello gave me the big 
smile. He nodded toward the 
door. "That young .fellow's going 
far. A good man. You're all good 
men here." He stuck a suckercup in the heater and passed it 
over to me with his own hands. 
"Coffee," he said. "My own 
brand. All I ever use." 

I tasted it and it was fine. He 
was a very generous man. He sat 
back and beamed at me while I 
drank it. 

"What do you know about 
Borinquen?" he wanted to know. 

I told him all I could. Borinquen's a pretty nice place, what 
they call "four-nines Earth Normal" — which means that the cli


MR . COSTELLO. HERO 



63 



mate, gravity, atmosphere and 
ecology come within .9999 of 
being the same as Earth's. There 
are only about six known planets 
like that. I told him about the 
one city it had and the trapping 
that used to be the main industry. Coats made out of glunker fur last forever. They shine 

green in white light and a real 
warm ember-red in blue light, 
and you can take a full-sized 
coat and scrunch it up and hide 
it in your two hands, it's that 
light and fine. Being so light, the 
fur made ideal space- cargo. 

Of course, there was a lot more 
on Borinquen now — rare isotope 
ingots and foodstuffs and seeds 
for the drug business and all, and 
I suppose the glunker trade could 
dry right up and Borinquen could 
still carry its weight. But furs 
settled the planet, furs supported 
the city in the early days, and 
half the population still lived 
out in the bush and trapped. 

Mr. Costello listened to everything I said in a way I can only 
call respectful. 

I remember I finished up by 
saying, "I'm sorry you have to 
get off there, Mr. Costello. I'd 
like to see you some more. I'd 
like to come see you at Borinquen, whenever we put in, though 
I don't suppose a man like you 
would have much spare time." 

He put his big hand on my 
arm. "Purser, if I don't have time 



when you're in port, I'll make 
time. Hear?" Oh, he had a wonderful way of making a fellow 
feel good. 

"VTEXT thing you know, he in
' vited me right into his cabin. 
He sat me down and handed me 
a sucker full of a mild red wine 
with a late flavor of cinnamon, 
which was a new one on me, and 
he showed me some of his things. 

He was a great collector. He 
had one or two little bits of colored paper that he said were 
stamps they used before the 
Space Age, to prepay carrying 
charges on paper letters. He said 
no matter where he was, just one 
of those things could get him a 
fortune. Then he had some jewels, not rings or anything, just 
stones, and a fine story for every 
single one of them. 

"What you're holding in your 
hand," he said, "cost the life of 
a king and the loss of an empire 
half again as big as United 
Earth." And : "This one was once 
so well guarded that most people 
didn't know whether it existed or 
not. There was a whole religion 
based on it — and now it*s gone, 
and so is the religion." 

It gave you a queer feeling, 
being next to this man who had 
so much, and him just as warm 
and friendly as your favorite 
uncle. 

"If you can assure me these 



64 



GALAXY SC1ENCI FICTION 



bulkheads are soundproof, I'll 
show you something else I collect," he said. 

I assured him they were, and 
they were, too. "If ships' architects ever learned anything," I 
told him, "they learned that a 
man has just got to be by himself once in a while." 

He cocked his head to one 
side in that way he had. "How's 
that again?" 

"A man's just got to be by himself once in a while," I said. "So, 
mass or no, cost or no, a ship's 
bulkheads are built to give a man 
his privacy." 

"Good," he said. "Now let me 
show you." He unlocked a handcase and opened it, and from a 
little compartment inside he took 
out a thing about the size of the 
box a watch comes in. He handled it very gently as he put it 
down on his desk. It was square, 
and it had a fine grille on the top 
and two little silver studs on the 
side. He pressed one of them and 
turned to me, smiling. And let 
me tell you, I almost fell right 
off the bunk where I was sitting, 
because here was the Captain's 
voice as loud and as clear and 
natural as if he was right there 
in the room with us. And do 
you know what he said? 

He said, "My crew questions 
my sanity — yet you can be sure 
that if a single man aboard questions my authority, he will learn 



that I am master here, even if he 
must learn it at the point of a 
gun." 

"WJT7HAT surprised me so much 
" wasn't only the voice but 
the words — and what surprised 
me especially about the words 
was that I had heard the Skipper 
say them myself. It was the time 
he had had the argument with 
Mr. Costello. I remembered it 
well because I had walked into 
the dayroom just as the Captain 
started to yell. 

"Mr. Costello," he said in that 
big heavy voice of his, "in spite 
of your conviction that my crew 
questions my sanity . . " and all 
the rest of it, just like on this 
recording Mr. Costello had. And 
I remember he said, too, "even if 
he must learn it at the point of 
a gun. That, sir, applies to passengers — the crew has legal 
means of their own." 

I was going to mention this to 
Mr. Costello, but before I could 
open my mouth, he asked me, 
"Now tell me, Purser, is that the 
voice of the Captain of your 
ship?" 

And I said, "Well, if it isn't, 
I'm not the Purser here. Why, 
I heard him speak those words 
my very own self." 

Mr. Costello swatted me on 
the shoulder. "You have a good 
ear. Purser. And how do you like 
my little toy?"

Then he showed it to me, a 
little mechanism on the jeweled 
pin he wore on his tunic, a fine 
thread of wire to a pushbutton in 
his side pocket. 

"One of my favorite collections," he told me. "Voices. Anybody, anytime, anywhere." He 
took off the pin and slipped a 
tiny bead out of the setting. He 
slipped this into a groove in the 
box and pressed the stud. 

And I heard my own voice say, 
"I'm sorry you have to get off 
there, Mr. Costello. I'd like to see 
you some more." I laughed and 
laughed. That was one of the 
cleverest things I ever saw. And 
just think of my voice in his 
collection, along with the Captain and space only knows how 
many great and famous people! 

He even had the voice of the 
Third Officer, from just a few 
minutes before, saying, "A lunatic has taken over the bridge. 
Well, something has to be done 
about it." 

All in all, I had a wonderful 
visit with him, and then he asked 
me to do whatever I had to do 
about his clearance papers. So I 
went back to my office and got 
.them out. They are kept in the 
Purser's safe during a voyage. 
And I went through them with 
the okaysv There were a lot of 
them — he had more than most 
people. 

I found one from Earth Cen


tral that sort of made me mad. I 
guess it was a mistake. It was a 
Know All Ye that warned consular officials to report every six 
months, Earth time, on the activities of Mr. Costello. 

I took it to him, and it was a 
mistake, all right — he said, so 
himself. I tore it out of his passport book and adhesed an official 
note, reporting the accidental destruction of a used page of fully 
stamped visas. He gave me a 
beautiful blue gemstone for doing 
it. 

When I said, "I better not; I 
don't want you thinking I take 
bribes from passengers," he 
laughed and put one of those 
beads in his recorder, and it came 
out, in my voice, "I take bribes 
from passengers." He was a great 
joker. 

TF7E lay at Borinquen for four 
days. Nothing much happened except I was busy. That's 
what's tough about pursering. 
You got nothing to do for weeks 
in space, and then, when you're 
in spaceport, you have too much 
work to do even to go ashore 
much, unless it's a long layover. 

I never really minded much. 
I'm one of those mathematical 
geniuses, you know, even if I 
don't have too much sense otherwise, and I take pride in my work. 
Everybody has something he's 
good at, I guess. I couldn't tell 



66 




 



you how the gimmick works that 
makes the ship travel faster than 
light, but I'd hate to trust the 
Chief Engineer with one of my 
interplanetary cargo manifests, 
or a rate-of -exchange table, 
glunker pelts to U.E. dollars. 

Some hard - jawed character 
with Space Navy Investigator 
credentials came inboard with a 
portable voice recorder and made 
me and the Third Officer recite 
a lot of nonsense for some sort of 
test, I don't know what. The SNI 
is always doing a lot of useless 
and mysterious things. I had an 
argument with the Port Agent, 
and I went ashore with Cooky 
for a fast drink. The usual thing. 
Then I had to work overtime 
signing on a new Third — they 
transferred the old one to a corvette that was due in, they told 
me. 

Oh, yes, that was the trip the 
Skipper resigned. I guess it was 
high time. He'd been acting very 
nervous. He gave me the damnedest look when he went ashore 
that last time, like he didn't 
know whether to kill me or burst 
into tears. There was a rumor 
around that he'd gone beserk and 
threatened the crew with a gun, 
but I don't listen to rumors. And 
anyway, the Port Captain signs 
on new skippers. It didn't mean 
any extra work for me, so it 
didn't matter much. 

We upshipped again and made 

MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



the rounds, Bootes Sigma and 
Nightingale and Caranho and 
Earth — chemical glassware, 
blackprints, sho seed and glitter 
crystals ; perfume, music tape, 
glizzard skins and Aldebar — all 
the usual junk for all the usual 
months. And round we came 
again to Borinquen. 

Well, you wouldn't believe a 
place could change so much in 
so short a time. Borinquen used 
to be a pretty free-and-easy planet. There was just the one goodsized city, see, and then trapper 
camps all through the unsettled 
area. If you liked people, you 
settled in the city, and you could 
go to work in the processing 
plants or maintenance or some 
such. If you didn't, you could 
trap glunkers. There was always 
something for everybody on Borinquen. 

But things were way different 
this trip. First of all, a man 
with a Planetary Government 
badge came aboard, by God, to 
censor the music tapes consigned 
for the city, and he had the credentials for it, too. Next thing 
I find out. the municipal authorities have confiscated the warehouses — my warehouses — and 
they were being converted into 
barracks. 

And where were the goods — the 
pelts and ingots for export? 
Where was the space for our 
cargo? Why, in houses — in hun
67 



dreds of houses, all spread around 
every which way, all indexed up 
with a whole big new office full 
of conscripts and volunteers to 
mix up and keep mixed up! For 
the first time since" I went to 
space, I had to request layover 
so I could get things unwound. 

A NYWAY it gave me a chance 
to wander around the town, 
which I don't often get. 

You should have seen the 
place! Everybody seemed to be 
moving out of the houses. All the 
big buildings were being made 
over into hollow shells, filled 
with rows and rows of mattresses. 
There were banners strung across 
the streets: are you a man or 

ARE YOU ALONE? A SINGLE SHINGLE 
IS A SORRY SHELTER! THE DEVIL 
HATES A CROWD! 

All of which meant nothing to 
me. But it wasn't until I noticed 
a sign painted in whitewash on 
the glass front of a barroom, saying TRAPPERS STAY OUT? that I 

was aware of one of the biggest 
changes of all. 

There were no trappers on the 
streets — none at all. They used 
to be one of the tourist attractions of Borinquen, dressed in 
glunker fur, with the long tailwings afloat in the wind of their 
walking, and a kind of distance 
in their eyes that not even spacemen had. As soon as I missed 
them, I began to see the trappers 



stay out! signs just about everywhere—on the stores, the restaurants, the hotels and theaters. 

I stood on a street corner, 
looking around me and wondering what in hell was going on 
here, when a Borinquen cop yelled something at me from a monowheel prowl car. I didn't 
understand him, so I just shrugged. He made a U-turn and 
coasted up to me. 

"What's the matter, country 
boy? Lose your traps?" 

I said, "What?" 

He said, "If you want to go 
it alone, glunker, we got solitary 
cells over at the Hall that'll suit 
you fine." 

I just gawked at him. And, to 
my surprise, another cop poked 
his head up out of the prowler. 
A one-man prowler, mind. They 
were really jammed in there. 

This second one said, "Where's 
your trapline, jerker?" 

I said, "I don't have a trapline." I pointed to the mighty 
tower of my ship, looming over 
the spaceport. "I'm the Purser 
off that ship." 

"Oh, for God's sakes!" said the 
first cop. "I might have known. 
Look, Spacer, you'd better 
double up or you're liable to get 
yourself mobbed. This is no spot 
for a soloist." 

"I don't get you, Officer. I 
was just — " 

"I'M take him," said someone 



68 




 



I looked around and saw a tall 
Bonnqueria standing just inside 
the open doorway of one of the 
hundreds of empty houses. She 
said, "I came back here to pick 
up some of my things. When I 
got done in here, there was nobody on the sidewalks. I've been 
here an hour, waiting for somebody to go with." She sounded a 
little hysterical. 

"You know better than to go 
in there by yourself/' said one 
of the cops. 

"I know— I know. It was just 
to get my things. I wasn't going 
to stay." She hauled up a duffelbag and dangled it in front of her. 
"Just to get my things," she said 
again, frightened. 

The cops looked at each other. 
"Well, all right. But watch yourself. You go along with the Purser here. Better straighten him 
out — he don't seem to know 
what's right." 

"I will," she said thankfully. 

But by then the prowler had 
moaned off, weaving a little under its double load. 

T LOOKED at her She wasn't 
pretty. She was sort of heavy 
and stupid. 

She said, "You'll be all right 
now. Let's go." 

"Where?" 

"Well, . Central Barracks, I 
guess. That's where most everybody is." 



"I have to get back to the 
ship." 

"Oh, dear," she said, all distressed again. "Right away?" 

"No, not right away. I'll go 
in town with you, if you want." 
She picked up her duffetbag, but 
I took it from her and heaved 
it up on my shoulder. "Is everybody here crazy?" I asked her, 
scowling. 

"Crazy?" She began walking, 
and I went along. "I don't think 
so." 

"All this," I persisted. I pointed to a banner that said, no 

LADDER HAS A SINGLE RUNG. 

"What's that mean?" 

"Just what it says." 

"You have to put up a big 
thing like that just to tell me . . ." 

"Oh," she said. "You mean 
what does it mean.'" She looked 
at me strangely. "We've found 
out a new truth about humanity. 
Look, I'll try to tell it to you the 
way Lucilles said it last night." 

"Who's Lucille?" 

"The Lucilles," she said, in a 
mildly shocked tone. "Actually, 
I suppose there's really only one 
— though, of course, there'll be 
someone else in the studio at the 
time," she added quickly. "But 
on trideo it looks like four Lucilles, all speaking at once, sort 
of in chorus." 

"You just go on talking," I 
said when she paused. "I catch 
on slowly."

"Well, here's what they say. 
They say no one human being 
ever did anything. They say it 
takes a hundred pairs of hands 
to build a house, ten thousand 
pairs to build a ship." They say 
a single pair is not only useless — 
it's eVi7. All humanity is a thing 
made up of many parts. No part 
is good by itself. Any part that 
wants to go off by itself hurts the 
whole main thing — the thing that 
has become so great. So we're 
seeing to it that no part ever gets 
separated. What good would 
your hand be if a finger suddenly 
decided to go off by itself?" 

I said, "And you believe this — 
what's your name?" 

"Nola. Believe it? Well, it's 
true, isn't it? Can't you see it's 
true? Everybody knows it's true." 



"Well, it could be true," I said 
reluctantly. "What do you do 
with people who want to be by 
themselves?" 

"We help them." 

"Suppose they don't want 
help?" 

"Then they're trappers," she 
said immediately. "We push them 
back into the bush, where the 
evil soloists come from." 

"Well, what about the fur?" 

"iVobody uses furs any more!" 




70 




 



So that's what happened to our 
fur consignments ! And I was 
thinking those amateur red-tapers had just lost 'em somewhere, 

She said, as if to herself, "All 
sin starts in the lonesome dark," 
and when I looked up, I saw 
she'd read it approvingly off another banner. 

WE rounded a corner and I 
blinked at a blaze of light. 
It was one of the warehouses. 

"There's the Central," she said. 
"Would you like to see it?" 
"I guess so." 

I followed her down the street 
to the entrance. There was a man 
sitting at a table in the doorway. 
Nola gave him a card. He checked it against a list and handed it 
back. 



"A visitor," she said. "From 
the ship." 

I showed him my Purser's card 
and he said, "Okay. But if you 
want to stay, you'll have to register." 

"I won't want to stay," I told 
him. "I have to get back." 

I followed Nola inside. 

The place had been scraped 
out to the absolute maximum. 
Take away one splinter of vertical structure more and it 
wouldn't have held a roof. There 
wasn't a concealed corner, a shelf, 
a drape, an overhang. There must 
have been two thousand beds, 
cots and mattresses spread out, 
cheek by jowl, over the entire 
floor, in blocks of four, with only 
a hand's-breadth between them. 
The light was blinding — huge 




MR. COSTELLO, 



HERO 



floods and spots bathed every 
square inch in yellow-white fire. 

Nola said, "You'll get used to 
the light. After a few nights, you 
don't even notice it." 

"The lights never get turned 
off?" 

"Oh, dear, no!" 

Then I saw the plumbing — 
showers, tubs, sinks and everything else. It was all lined up 
against one wall. 

Nola followed my eyes. "You 
get used to that, too. Better to 
have everything out in the open 
than to let the devil in for one 
secret second. That's what the 
Lucilles say." 

I dropped her duffelbag and sat 
down on it. The only thing I 
could think of was, "Whose idea 
was all this? Where did it start?" 

"The Lucilles," she said vaguely. Then, "Before them, I don't 
know. People just started to realize. Somebody bought a warehouse—no, it was a hangar — I 
don't know," she said again, apparently trying hard to remember. She sat down next to me 
and said in a subdued voice, 
"Actually, some people didn't 
take to it so well at first," She 
looked around. "/ didn't. I mean 
it, I really didn't. But you believed, or you had to act as if 
you believed, and one way or 
another everybody just came to 
this." She waved a hand. 

"What happened to the ones 



who wouldn't come to Centrals?" 

"People made fun of them. 
They lost their jobs, the schools 
wouldn't take their children, the 
stores wouldn't honor their ration 
cards. Then the police started to 
pick up soloists — like they did 
you." She looked around again, 
a sort of contented familiarity 
in her gaze. "It didn't take long." 

I turned away from her, but 
found myself staring at all that 
plumbing again. I jumped up. 
"I have to go, Nola. Thanks for 
your help. Hey — how do I get 
back to the ship, if the cops are 
out to pick up any soloist they 
see?" 

"Oh, just tell the man at the 
gate. There'll be people waiting 
to go your way. There's always 
somebody waiting to go everywhere." 

SHE came along with me. I 
spoke to the man at the gate, 
and she shook hands with me. I 
stood by the little table and 
watched her hesitate, then step 
up to a woman who was entering. They went in together. The 
doorman nudged me over toward 
a group of what appeared to be 
loungers. 

"North!" he bawled. 
I drew a pudgy little man with 
bad teeth, who said not one single 
word. We escorted each other 
two-thirds of the way to the 
spaceport, and he disappeared 



72 




 



into a factory. I scuttled the rest 
of the way alone, feeling like a 
criminal, which I suppose I was. 
I swore I would never go into 
that crazy city again. 

And the next morning, who 
should come out for me, in an 
armored car with six two-man 
prowlers as escort, but Mr. Costello himself! 

It was pretty grand seeing him 
again. He was just like always, 
big and handsome and good-natured. He was not alone. All 
spread out in the back corner 
of the car was the most beautiful 
blonde woman that ever struck 
me speechless. She didn't say 
very much. She would just look 
at me every once in a while and 
sort of smile, and then she would 
look out of the car window and 
bite on her lower lip a little, and 
then look at Mr. Costello and 
not smile at all. 

Mr. Costello hadn't forgotten 
me. He had a bottle of that same 
red cinnamon wine, and he talked over old times the same as 
ever, like he was a special uncle. 
We got a sort of guided tour. I 
told him about last night, about 
the visit to the Central, and he 
was pleased as could be. He said 
he knew I'd like it. I didn't stop 
to think whether I liked it or not. 

"Think of it!" he said. "All 
humankind, a single unit. You 
know the principle of cooperation, Purser?" 



When I took too long to think 
it out, he said, "You know. Two 
men working together can produce more than two men working 
separately. Well, what happens 
when a thousand — a million — 
work, sleep, eat, think, breathe 
together?" The way he said it, 
it sounded fine. 

He looked out past my shoulder and his eyes widened just a 
little. He pressed a button and 
the chauffeur brought us to a 
sliding stop. 

"Get that one," Mr. Costello 
said into a microphone beside 
him. 

Two of the prowlers hurtled 
down the street and flanked a 
man. He dodged right, dodged 
left, and then a prowler hit him 
and knocked him down. 

"Poor chap," said Mr. Costello, 
pushing the Go button. "Some of 
'em just won't learn." 

I think he regretted it very 
much. I don't know if the blonde 
woman did. She didn't even look. 

"Are you the mayor?" I asked 
him. 

"Oh, no," he said. "I'm a sort 
of broker. A little of this, a little 
of that. I'm able to help out a 
bit." 

"Help out?" 

"Purser," he said confidentially, "I'm a citizen of Borinquen 
now. This is my adopted land 
and I love it. I mean to do everything in my power to help it. I 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



73 



don't care about the cost. This is 
a people that has found the truth, 
Purser. It awes me. It makes me 
humble." 

"Speak up, man. I'm your 
friend." 

"I appreciate that, Mr. Costello. Well, what I was going to 
say, I saw that Central and all. 
I just haven't made up my mind. 
I mean whether it's good or not." 

"Take your time, take your 
time," he said in the big soft 
voice. "Nobody has to make a 
man see a truth, am I right? A 
real truth? A man just sees it all 
by himseff." 

"Yeah," I agreed. "Yeah, I 
guess so." Sometimes it was hard 
to find an answer to give Mr. 
Costello. 

'¥^HE car pulled up beside a 
building. The blonde woman 
pulled herself together. Mr. Costello opened the door for her with 
his own hands. She got out. Mr. 
Costello rapped the trideo screen 
in front of him. 

He said, "Make it a real good 
one, Lucille, real good. I'll be 
watching." 

"She looked at him. She gave 
me a small smile. A man came 
down the steps and she went with 
him up into the building. 

We moved off. 

I said, "She's the prettiest woman I ever saw." 



He said, "She likes you fine, 
Purser." , 

I thought about that. It was 
too much. 

He asked, "How would you 
like to have her for your very 
own?" 

"Oh," I said, "she wouldn't." 

"Purser, I owe you a big favor. 
I'd like to pay it back." 

"You don't owe me a thing, 
Mr. Costello!" 

We drank some of the wine. 
The big car slid silently along. It 
went slowly now, headed back 
out to the spaceport. 

"I need some help," he said 
after a time. "I know you, Purser. You're just the kind of man 
I can use. They say you're a 
mathematical genius." 

"Not mathematics exactly, Mr. 
Costello. Just numbers — statistics — conversion tables and like 
that. I couldn't do astrogation or 
theoretical physics and such. I 
got the best job I could have 
right now." 

"No, you haven't. I'll be frank 
with you. I don't want any more 
responsibility on Borinquen than 
I've got, you understand, but the 
people are forcing it on me. They 
want order, peace and order — 
tidiness. They want to be as nice 
and tidy as one of your multiple 
manifests. Now I could organize 
them, all right, but I need a tidy 
brain like yours to keep them 
organized. I want full birth-and 



74 




 



death-rate statistics, and then I 
want them projected so we can 
get policy. I want calory-counts 
and rationing, so we can use the 
food supply the best way. I want 
— well, you see what I mean. Once 
the devil is routed — " 
"What devil?" 

"The trappers," he said grayly. 

"Are the trappers really harming the city people?" 

He looked at me, shocked. 
"They go out and spend weeks 
alone by themselves, with their 
own evil thoughts. They are wandering cells, wild cells in the body 
of humanity. They must be destroyed." 

¥ COULDN'T help but think 
of my consignments. "What 
about the fur trade, though?" 

He looked at me as if I had 
made a pretty grubby little mistake. "My dear Purser," he said 
patiently, "would you set the 
price of a few pelts above the 
immortal soul of a race?" 

I hadn't thought of it that way. 

He said urgently, "This is just 
the beginning. Purser. Borinquen 
is only a start. The unity of that 
great being. Humanity, will become known throughout the Universe." He closed his eyes. When 
he opened them, the organ tone 
was gone. He said in his old, 
friendly voice, "And you and I, 
we'll show 'em how to do it, hey, 
boy?" 



I leaned forward to look up to 
the top of the shining spire of the 
spaceship. "I sort of like the job 
I ' ve got. But — my contract is 
up four months from now . , ." 

The car turned into the spaceport and hummed across the slag 
area. 

"I think I 'can count on you," 
he said vibrantly. He laughed. 
"Remember this little joke, Purser?" 

He clicked a switch, and suddenly my own voice filled the 
tonneau. "/ fa/ce bribes from passengers." 

"Oh, that," I said, and let 
loose one ha of a ha-ha before I 
understood what he was driving 
at. "Mr. Costello, you wouldn't 
use that against me." 

"What do you take me for?" he 
demanded, in wonderment. 

Then we were at the ramp. He 
got out with me. He gave me his 
hand. It was warm and hearty. 

"If you change your mind 
about the Purser's job when your 
contract's up. son, just buzz me 
through the field phone. They'll 
connect me. Think it over until 
you get back here. Take your 
time." His hand clamped down 
on my biceps so hard I winced. 
"But you're not going to take 
any longer than that, are you, 
my boy?" 

"I guess not," I said. 

He got into the front, by the 
chauffeur, and zoomed away.

I stood looking after him and, 
when the car was just a dark 
spot on the slag area, I sort of 
came to myself. I was standing 
alone on the foot of the ramp. 
I felt very exposed. 

I turned and ran up to the airlock, hurrying, hurrying to get 
near people. 

rT^HAT was the trip \ye shipped 
the crazy man. His name was 
Hynes. He was United Earth 
Consul at Borinquen and he was 
going back to report. He was no 
trouble at first, because diplomatic passports are easy to process. He knocked on my door the 
fifth watch out from Borinquen. 
I was glad to see him. My room 
was making me uneasy and I appreciated his company. 

Not that he was really company. He was crazy. That first 
time, he came busting in and 
said, "I hope you don't mind, 
Purser, but if I don't talk to 
somebody about this, I'll go out 
of my mind." Then he sat down 
on the end of my bunk and put 
his head in his hands and rocked 
back and forth for a long time, 
without saying anything. Next 
thmg he said was, "Sorry," and 
out lie went. Crazy, I tell you. 

But he was back in again before long. And then you never 
heard such ravings. 

"Do you know what's happened to Borinquen?" he'd demand. 



But he didn't want any answers. 
He had the answers. "I'll tell 
you what's wrong with Borinquen — Borinquen's gone mad!" 
he'd say. 

I went on with my work, 
though there wasn't much of it 
in space, but that Hynes just 
couldn't get Borinquen out of his 
mind. 

He said, "You wouldn't believe 
it if you hadn't seen it done. 
First the little wedge, driven in 
the one place it might exist — between the urbans and the trappers. There was never any 
conflict between them — never! 
All of a sudden, the trapper was 
a menace. How it happened, why, 
God only knows. First, these 
laughable attempts to show that 
they were an unhealthy influence. 
Yes, laughable— how could you 
take it seriously? 

"And then the changes. You 
didn't have to prove that a trapper had done anything. You only 
had to prove he was a trapper. 
That was enough. And the next 
thing — how could you anticipate 
anything as mad as this?" — he 
almost screamed — "the next 
thing was to take anyone who 
wanted to be alone and lump 
him with the trappers. It all 
happened so fast — it happened 
in our sleep. And all of a sudden 
you were afraid to be alone in a 
room for a second. They left 
their homes. They built barracks.

Everyone afraid of everyone else, 
afraid, afraid . . . 

"Do you know what they did?" 
he roared. "They burned the 
paintings, every painting on Borinquen they could find that had 
been done by one artist. And the 
few artists who survived as artists — I've seen them. By twos and 
threes, they work together on the 
one canvas." 

He cried. He actually sat there 
and cried. 

He said, "There's food in the 
stores. The crops come in. Trucks 
run, planes fly, the schools are 
in session. Bellies get full, cars 
get washed, people get rich. I 
know a man called Costello, just 
in from Earth a few months, 
maybe a year or so, and already 
owns half the city." 

"Oh, I know Mr. Costello," I 
said. 

"Do you now! How's that?" 

I TOLD him about the trip out 
with Mr. Costello. He sort of 
backed off from me. "You're the 
one!" 

"The one what?" I asked in 
puzzlement. 

"Kou're the man who testified 
against your Captain, broke him, 
made him resign." 

"I did no such a thing." 

"I'm the Consul. It was my 
hearing, man! I was there.' A recording of the Captain's voice, 
admitting to insanity, declaring 



he'd take a gun to his crew if 
they overrode him. Then your recorded testimony that it was his 
voice, that you were present when 
he made the statement. And the 
Third Officer's recorded statement that all was not well on the 
bridge. The man denied it, but 
it was his voice." 

"Wait, wait," I said. "I don't 
believe it. That would need a 
trial. There was no trial. I wasn't 
called to any trial." 

"There would have been a 
trial, you idiot! But the Captain 
started raving about draw poker 
without a draw, about the crew 
fearing poisoning from the cook, 
about the men wanting witnesses 
even to change the bridge-watch. 
Maddest thing I ever heard. He 
realized it suddenly, the Captain 
did. He was old, sick, tired, beaten. He blamed the whole thing on 
Costello, and Costello said he got 
the recordings from you." 

"Mr. Costello wouldn't do such 
a thing!" I guess I got mad at 
Mr. Hynes then. I told him a 
whole lot about Mr. Costello, 
what a big man he was. He started to tell me how Mr. Costello 
was forced off the Triumverate 
for making trouble in the high 
court, but they were lies and I 
wouldn't listen. I told him about 
the poker, how Mr. Costello 
saved us from the cheaters, how 
he saved us from poisoning, how 
he made the ship safe for us all. 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



77 



I remember how he looked at 
me then. He sort of whispered, 
"What has happened to human 
beings? What have we done to 
ourselves with these centuries of 
peace, with confidence and cooperation and no conflict? Here's 
distrust by man for man, waiting 
under a thin skin to be punctured 
by just the right vampire, waiting 
to hate itself and kill itself all 
over again . . . 

"My Cod!" he suddenly 
screamed at me. "Do you know 
what I've been hanging onto? 
The idea that, for all its error, for 
all its stupidity, this One Humanity idea on Borinquen was a 
principle? I hated it, but because 
it was a principle, I could respect it. It's Costello — Costello, 
who doesn't gamble, but who 
uses fear to change the poker 
rules — Costello, who doesn't eat 
your food, but makes -you fear 
poison — Costello, who can see 
three hundred years of safe interstellar flight, but who through 
fear makes the watch officers 
doubt themselves without a witness — Costello, who runs things 
without being seen! 

"My God, Costello doesn't 
care! It isn't a principle at all. 
It's just Costello spreading fear 
anywhere, everywhere, to make 
himself strong!" 

He rushed out, crying with rage 
and hate. I have to admit I was 
sort of jolted. I guess I might 



even have thought about the 
things he said, only he killed 
himself before we reached Earth. 
He was crazy. 

YV/E made the rounds, same as 
™ ever, scheduled like an interurban line : Load, discharge, 
blastoff, fly and planetfall. Refuel, clearance, manifest. Eat, 
sleep, work. There was a hearing 
about Hynes. Mr. Costello sent 
a spacegram with his regrets 
when he heard the news. I didn't 
say anything at the hearing, just 
that Mr. Hynes was upset, that's 
all, and it was about as true as 
anything could be. We shipped a 
second engineer who played real 
good accordian. One of the inboard men got left on Caranho. 
All the usual things, except I 
wrote up my termination with 
no options, ready to file. 

So in its turn we made Borinquen again, and what do you 
know, there was the space fleet of 
United Earth. I never guessed 
they had that many ships. They 
sheered us off, real Navy : all 
orders and no information. Borinquen was buttoned up tight; 
there was some kind of fighting 
going on down there. We couldn't 
get or give a word of news 
through the quarantine. It made 
the skipper mad and he had to 
use part of the cargo for fuel, 
which messed up my records six 
ways from the middle. I stashed 



78 




 



my termination papers away for 
the time being. 

And in its turn, Sigma, where 
we lay over a couple of days to 
get back in the rut, and, same as 
always, Nightingale, right on 
schedule again. 

And who should be waiting for 
me at Nightingale but Barney 
Roteel, who was medic on my 
first ship, years back when I was 
fresh from the Academy. He had 
a pot belly now and looked real 
successful. We got the jollity out 
of the way and he settled down 
and looked me over, real sober. I 
said it's a small Universe — I'd 
known he had a big job on Nightingale, but imagine him showing 
up at the spaceport just when I 
blew in! 

"I showed up because you 
blew in, Purser," he answered. 

Then before I could take that 
apart, he started asking me questions. Like how was I doing, 
what did I plan to do. 

I said, "I've been a purser for 
years and years. What makes 
you think I want to do anything 
different?" 

"Just wondered." 

I wondered, too. "Well," I 
said, "I haven't exactly made up 
my mind, you might say — and a 
couple of things have got in the 
way — but I did have a kind of 
offer." I told him just in a general way about how big a man 
Mr. Costello was on Borinquen 



now, and how he wanted me to 
come in with him. "It'll have to 
wait, though. The whole damn 
Space Navy has a cordon around 
Borinquen. They wouldn't say 
why. But whatever it is, Mr. 
Costello'll come out on top. 
You'll see." 

Barney gave me a sort of puckered-up look. I never saw a man 
look so weird. Yes, I did, too. 
It was the old Iron Man, the 
day he got off the ship and resigned. 

"Barney, what's the matter?" 
I asked. 

He got up and pointed through 
the glass door-lights to a white 
monowheel that stood poised in 
front of the receiving station. 
"Come on," he said. 

"Aw, I can't. I got to — " 

"Come on/" 

I shrugged. Job or no, this was 
Barney's bailiwick, not mine. 
He'd cover me. 

He held the door open and 
said, like a mind reader, "I'll 
cover you." 

We went down the ramp and 
climbed in and skimmed off. 

"Where are we going?" 

But he wouldn't say. He just 
drove.

no local options, but none. Ifs a 
regular garden of a world and 
they keep it that way. 

We topped a rise and went 
down a curving road lined with 
honest-to-God Lombardy poplars from Earth. There was a 
little lake down there and a 
sandy beach. No people. 

The road curved and there 
was a yellow line across it and 
then a red one, and after it a 
shimmering curtain, almost transparent. It extended from side to 
side as far as I could see. 

"Force-fence," Barney said and 
pressed a button on the dash. 

The shimmer disappeared from 
the road ahead, though it stayed 
where it was at each side. We 
drove through and it formed behind us, and we went down the 
hill to the lake. 

Just this side of the beach was 
the coziest little Sigma cabana 
I've seen yet, built to hug the 
slope and open its arms to the 
sky. Maybe when I get old they'll 
-turn me out to pasture in one 
half as good. 

While I was goggling at it, 
Barney" said, "Go on." 

I looked at him and he was 
pointing. There was a man down 
near the water, big, very tanned, 
built like a space-tug. Barney 
waved me on and I walked down 
there. ( 

The man got up and turned to 
me. He had the same wide-spac


ed, warm deep eyes, the same 
full, gentle voice. "Why, it's the 
Purser! Hi, old friend. So you 
came, after all!" 

It was sort of rough for a moment. Then I got it out. "Hi, 
Mr. Costello." 

He banged me on the shoulder. 
Then he wrapped one big hand 
around my left biceps and pulled 
me a little closer. He looked uphill to where Barney leaned 
against the monowheel, minding 
his own business. Then he looked 
across the lake, and up in the 
sky. 

He dropped his voice. "Purser, 
you're just the man I need. But 
I told you that before, didn't I?" 
He looked around again. "We'll 
do it yet, Purser. You and me, 
we'll hit the top. Come with me. 
I want to show you something." 

He walked ahead of me toward 
the beach margin. He was wearing only a breech-ribbon, but he 
moved and spoke as if he still 
had the armored car and the six 
prowlers. I stumbled after him. 

He put a hand behind him and 
checked me, and then knelt. He 
said, "To look at them, you'd 
think they were all the same, 
wouldn't you? Well, son, you just 
let me show you something." 

I looked down. He had an anthill. They weren't like Earth ants. 
These were bigger, slower, blue, 
and they had eight legs. They 
built nests of sand tied together 



80 




 



with mucus, and tunneled under 
them so that the nests stood up 
an inch or two like on little 
pillars. 

"They look the same, they act 
the same, but you'll see," said 
Mr. Costeilo. 

He opened a synthine pouch 
that lay in the sand. He took out 
a dead bird and the thorax of 
what looked like a Caranho 
roach, the one that grows as long 
as your forearm. He put the bird 
down here and the roach down 
yonder. 

"Now," he said, "watch." 



rpHE ants swarmed to the bird, 
pulling and crawling. Busy. 
But one or two went to the roach 
and tumbled it and burrowed 
around. Mr. Costeilo picked an 
ant off the roach and dropped it 
on the bird. It weaved around 
and shouldered through the 
others and scrabbled across the 
sand and went back to the roach. 

"You see, you see?" he said, 
enthusiastic. "Look." 

He picked an ant off the dead 
bird and dropped it by the roach. 
The ant wasted no time or even 
curiosity on the piece of roach.

It turned around once to get its 
bearings, and then went straight 
back to the dead bird. 

I looked at the bird with its 
clothing of crawling blue, and I 
looked at the roach with its two 
or three voracious scavengers. I 
looked at Mr. Costello. 

He said raptly, "See what I 
mean? About one in thirty eats 
something different. And that's 
all we need. I tell you, Purser, 
wherever you look, if you look 
long enough, you can find a way 
to make most of a group turn 
on the rest." 

I watched the ants. "They're 
not fighting." 

"Now wait a minute," he said 
swiftly. "Wait a minute. All we 
have to do is let these bird-eaters 
know that the roach-eaters are 
dangerous." 

"They're not dangerous," I 
said. "They're just different." 

"What's the difference, when 
you come right down to it? So 
we'll get the bird-eaters scared 
and they'll kill all the roach-eaters." ( 

"Yes, but why, Mr. Costello?" 

He laughed. "I like you, boy. 
I do the thinking, you do the 
work. I'll explain it to you. They 
all look alike. So once we've 
made 'em drive out these- — " he 
pointed to the minority around 
the roach — "they'll never know 
which among, 'em might be a 
roach-eater. They'll get so wor


ried, they'll do anything to keep 
from being suspected of roacheating. When they get scared 
enough, we can make 'em do 
anything we want." 

He hunkered down to watch 
the ants. He picked up a roacheater and put it on the bird. I 
got up. 

"Well, I only just dropped in, 
Mr. Costello," I said. 

"I'm not an ant," said Mr. 
Costello. "As long as it makes no 
difference to me what they eat, I 
can make 'em do anything in the 
world I want." 

"I'll see you around," I said. 

He kept on talking quietly to 
himself as I walked away. He 
was watching -the ants, figuring, 
and paid no attention to me. 

I went back to Barney, I 
asked, sort of choked, "What is 
he doing, Barney?" 

"He's doing what he has to 
do," Barney said. 

1W/E went back to the mono*" wheel and up the hill and 
through the force-gate. After a 
while, I asked, "How long will 
he be here?" 

"As long as he wants to be." 
Barney was kind of short about 
it. 

"Nobody wants to be locked 
up." 

He had that odd look on his 
face again. "Nightingale's not a 
jail." 



82 




 



"He can't get out." 

"Look, chum, we could start 
him over. We could even make 
a purser out of him. But we stopped doing that kind of thing a 
long time ago. We let a man do 
what he wants to do." 

"He never wanted to be boss 
over an anthill." 

"He didn't?" 

I guess I looked as if I didn't 
understand that, so he said, "All 
his life he's pretended he's a 
man and the rest of us are ants. 
Now it's come true for him. He 
won't run human anthills any 
more because he will never again 
get near one." 

I looked through the windshield at the shining finger that 
was my distant ship. "What happened on Borinquen , Barney ?" 

"Some of his converts got loose 
around the System. That Humanity One idea had to be stopped." He drove a while, seeing 
badly out of a thinking face. 
"You won't take this hard, Purser, but you're a thick-witted 
ape. I can say that if no one else 
can." 

'All right," I said. "Why?" 

"We had to smash into Borinquen, which used to be so free 
and easy. We got into Costello's 
place. It was a regular fort. We 
got him and his files. We didn't 
get his girl. He killed her, but 
the files were enough." 

After a time I said, "He was 



always a good friend to me." 
"Was he?" 

I didn't say anything. He 
wheeled up to the receiving station and stopped the machine. 

He said, "He was all ready for 
you if you came to work for 
him. He had a voice recording of 
you large as life, saying 'Sometimes a man's just got to be by 
himself.' Once you went to work 
for him, all he needed to do to 
keep you in line was to threaten 
to put that on the air." 

I opened the door. "What did 
you have to show him to me for?" 

"Because we believe in letting 
a man do what he wants to do, as 
long as he doesn't hurt the rest 
of us. If you want to go back to 
the lake and work for Costello. 
for instance, I'll take you there." 

I closed the door carefully and 
went up the ramp to the ship. 

I did my work and when the 
time came, we blasted off. I was 
mad. I don't think it was about 
anything Barney told me. I 
wasn't especially mad about Mr. 
Costello or what happened to 
him, because Barney's the best 
Navy psych doc there is and 
Nightingale's the most beautiful 
hospital planet in the Universe. 

What made me mad was the 
thought that never again would 
a man as big as Mr. Costello give 
that big, warm, soft, strong 
friendship to a lunkhead like me.

CHILDREN OF THE ATOM 
by Wilmar H. Shiras. Gnome 
Press, New York, 1953. 216 
pages, $2.75. 

rjlHE theme of the mutant child 
conceived in the vicinity of an 
atomic explosion has been worked over almost to boredom since 
1945. Professional science fiction 
writers of all qualities have tried 
their hands at it, but it is not 
too much to say that none of 
them has approached, much less 
equaled, the sensitive charm and 
understanding that Wilmar Shiras, a heretofore unknown writer, 
here brings to her fictional ana


lysis of the problems of super genius children. 

Those of us who happened to 
read her first Astounding novelet 
"In Hiding" more than five years 
ago will never forget the delighted shock of finding someone writing with real tenderness and 
perception about a problem 
which, in some degree at least, 
comes close to every one of us. 

For those who missed "In Hiding" and its sequels, it should be 
mentioned that the story is based 
on the assumption that after a 
catastrophic atomic explosion in 
the U.S. in 1958, a number of 
mutant children are born near 



84 




 



the site of the tragedy. These 
super-genius kids hide their qualities until a psychiatrist named 
Peter Welles discovers one of 
them, a boy, and leads him to an 
understanding of his social problems, the problems of a truly intelligent being in a world of 
quasi- morons. 

The story develops as the two 
seek out the other mutants and 
bring them together in a special 
school for handling their own 
difficulties, which are primarily 
emotional rather than intellectual. For these children find it 
difficult to adjust to "life." 

It is a pleasure to report that 
Mrs. Shiras's finished novel, 
which contains nearly as much 
new material as reprint, measures 
up to the high standard set in "In 
Hiding." In one of the two new 
sections, the kids themselves begin solving their own social problems with a delightful mixture of 
mature scientific knowledge and 
of instinctive "peck order" psychology. In the second and last, 
they arrive at the only possible 
solution to their "differentness," 
following an attack upon them 
by a rabble-rousing radio 
preacher. 

The book now has a story line 
and a richness of character development that lift it out of the 
realm of the standard "supergenius" tale. Unreservedly recommended. 



LOST CIVILIZATION; 
THREE ADVENTURE NOVELS by H. Rider Haggard. Dover Publications, New York, 
1953, 776 pages, $3.95 

"IT IS pleasant to have these 
three historical novels back in 
print again. Haggard stands up 
amazingly well against the erosion of time. He is wordy and 
slow, it is true, but he is also 
vivid and satisfying. 

The book contains Montezuma's Daughter, a rich and brutal 
narrative of the fall of the Aztec 
Empire in Mexico; Eric Brighteyes, a retelling of one of the 
Icelandic sagas; and Cleopatra, 
a romantic version of the ancient 
tragedy of the Egyptian Queen. 

These ornately embroidered 
tapestries of imaginative adventure have rarely been surpassed 
for color, though they may have 
been for historical accuracy, in 
the half century since Haggard 
first set them down. Eminently 
readable.

starts out to write a suspense novel and gives it everything he's got, he's hard to

85 



ly one of the British experts. The 
Secret Masters, a suspense novel 
with science fiction aspects, provides one of Kersh's most continuously thrilling narratives and 
along with it a set of characters 
so three dimensional and individual that they seem to be living 
portraits. 

The story is not quite as convincing as the characters nor as 
effective as the style in which it 
is written. It concerns itself with 
the uncovering of an international plot by the most powerful men 
in the world to destroy five-sixths 
of the human race by means of a 
fantastic new type of atomic 
bomb and to use most of the remaining people in a "sciocratic" 
slavocracy. 

The story gradually collapses 
in a morass of unresolved and 
unfinished business in the last 
few chapters. But don't let this 
defect hinder you from reading 
the book. It is still, on the whole, 
a first rate science fiction goose 
pimpler. 

THE ATOM STORY by J. 
G. F einberg. Philosophical Library, New York, 1953. 243 
pages, $4.75 

T>Y now, there must be hundreds of books, in and out of 
print, that purport to tell "The 
Atom Story." Generally they are 
all pretty much alike: gee-whiz 



stuff on E--MCj atomic bombs, 
and the wonders of our atomic 
future — provided we don't commit suicide meanwhile on a global 
scale. 

Dr. Feinberg has written an 
entirely different sort of book. A 
historian of science and a student 
of one of Britain's most celebrated physicists, Sir Frederick Soddy, he has outlined in rich detail 
the whole story of Man's ideas 
about ultimate particles, the 
composition of matter, and similar affairs, and has done so with 
a liveliness that is in no way 
touched with sensationalism so 
dear to Sunday supplement editors apd authors alike. 

We learn what were the contributions to atomic theory (or 
its opposing theories) by everyone from Democritus on down. 
We read with new fascination 
the story of the momentous 
events of 1939-1945 as seen 
through British eyes; and are 
given a great deal of the basics 
of modern nuclear physics and 
chemistry in completely understandable language. 

The book gains velocity and 
charm from its shrewd and often 
controversial judgments of people, its almost conversational 
style, and the warmth of conviction with which its author approaches his momentous subject. 
Highly rewarding for the curiousminded layman.

THE ABYSS OF WONDERS 
by Perley Poore Sheehan. Polaris 
Press, Box 159. Reading, Pa., 
1953. 190 pages, $3.00 

T LOYD ESCHBACHS second 
item in his Polaris Fantasy 
Library of pre- 1920 reprints does 
not stack up as well for the general reader as did his first, The 
Heads of Cerberus by Francis 
Stevens. 

This new item is really a fairy 
tale for youngsters, about how a 
young American, John McGoff, 
finds a magic city, complete with 
dream people, at the site of Genghis Khan's tomb in the Gobi 
Desert. He does this with the 
supernatural assistance of a number of "stick-figures" such as an 
old Chinese laundryman and an 
eccentric Russian cobbler. 

There is an idealistic love 
story, and a self-sacrificing 
grandma, and various other mechanical devices, and the whole 
is written in a kindergarten style 
that is irritating to most modern 
readers. 

However, I am sure that the 
book will appeal to a generation 
with memories that reach back to 
its original appearance in Argosy in 1915. But surely there 
are old stories much worthier of 
reprint. I hope Mr. Eschbach 
finds them. 



WORLD OUT OF MIND by 
J. T. M'Intosh. Doubleday, New 
York, 1953. 222 pages, $2.75 

A NOTHER alien invasion 
story, with a hero who is 
supposed to be "advance agent" 
for the invaders, this is a slick 
job — one of those fast-paced 
melodramas of the "might-be" 
that are always intriguing no 
matter how trite the subject. 

The events take place in a 
society in which everyone 
achieves his true niche in life by 
Taking Tests. The smarter you 
are, the higher you climb, until 
you become a White Star, of 
which there may be fewer than 
a dozen in any one generation. 

Eldin Raigmore, a "man with 
no past," begins to take the tests 
soon after he has encountered 
beautiful Alison Hever, youngest 
living White Star. Before long, 
he is a White Star, too, and on 
the way to preparing the world 
to be taken over by the aliens. 

However, he changes his mind 
(love, ah, love!) and the invaders 
are finally beaten off in the last 
few pages of the book because 
(among other reasons) they are 
purely logical and do not know 
emotion. 

Why logic forces them to retreat is one of the high points of 
the book. — CROFF COINKLIIN

It is a tough decision to make

FOR an instant you think,

Then the nerves of your body 
tell you that you are standing,

were sitting comfortably, almost 
reclining, in a canvas chair. In 
the patio of a friend's house in 
Beverly Hills. Talking to Barbara, your fiancee. Looking at

You are naked. And standing. 

Whatever has happened to you 
is more than a change to sudden

You raise your hands gropingly before you. They touch a plain

TT is not large, but it is plea■■■ santly furnished — - although 
the furniture is of a style that is 
strange to you. Modesty makes 
you open the door cautiously the 
rest of the way. But the room is 
empty of people. 

You step into the room, turning to look behind you into the 
closet, which is now illuminated 
by light from the room. The closet is and is not a closet; it is the 
size and shape of one, but it 
contains nothing, not a single 
hook, no rod for hanging clothes, 
no shelf. It is an empty, blankwalled, four-by-four foot space. 

You close the door to it and 
stand looking around the room. 
It is about twelve by sixteen feet. 
There is one door, but it is closed. 
There are no windows. Five 
pieces of furniture. Four of them 
you recognize — more or less. One 
looks like a very functional desk. 
One is obviously a chair ... a 
comfortable-looking one. There 
is a table, although its top is on 
several levels instead of only one. 
Another is a bed, or couch. 
Something shimmering is' lying 



across it and you walk over and 
pick the shimmering something 
up and examine it. It is a garment. 

You are naked, so you put it 
on. Slippers are part way under 
the bed (or couch) and you slide 
your feet into them. They fit, 
and they feel warm and comfortable as nothing you have ever 
worn on your feet has felt. Like 
lamb's wool, but softer. 

You are dressed now. You 
look at the door — the only door 
of the room except that of the 
closet (closet?) from which you 
entered it. You walk to the door 
and before you try the knob, you 
see the small typewritten sign 
pasted just above it that reads: 

This door has a time lock set to 
open in one hour. For reasons you 
will soon understand, it is better 
that you do not leave this room before then. There is a letter for you 
on the desk. Please read it. 

It is not signed. You look at 
the desk and see that there is 
an envelope lying on it. 

You do not yet go to take that 
envelope from the desk and read 
the letter that must be in it. 

Why not? Because you are 
frightened. 

You see other things about the 
room. The lighting has no source 
that you can discover. It comes 
from nowhere. It is not indirect 
lighting; the ceiling and the walls 



HALL OF MIRRORS 



arc not reflecting it at all. 

They didn't have lighting like 
that, back where you came from. 
What did you mean by back 
where you came from? 

You close your eyes. You tell 
yourself: J am Norman Hastings, 
I am an associate professor of 
mathematics at the University of 
Southern California. I am twenty-five years old, and this is the 
year nineteen hundred and fiftyfour. 

You open your eyes and look 
again. 

rpHEY didn't use that "style of 
* furniture in Los Angeles — or 
anywhere else that you know of 
— in 1954. That thing over in the 
corner — you can't even guess 
what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked 
at a television set. 

You look down at yourself, at 
the shimmering garment that 
you found waiting for you. With 
thumb and forefinger you feel its 
texture. 

It's like nothing you've ever 
touched before. 

/ am Norman Hastings. This 
is nineteen hundred and fifty four. 

Suddenly you must know, and 
at once. 

You go to the desk and pick 
up the envelope that lies upon it. 
Your name is typed on the out 
side. Norman Hasting*-. 



Your hands shake a little as 
you open it. Do you blame them? 

There are several pages, typewritten. Dear Norman, it starts. 
You turn quickly to the end to 
look for the signature. It is unsigned. 

You turn back and start reading. 

"Do not be afraid. There is 
nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock 
opens that door. Much that you 
must accept and — obey. 

"You have already, guessed 
that you are in the future — in 
what, to you, seems to be the 
future. The clothes and the room 
must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock 
would not be too sudden, so you 
would realize it over the course 
of several minutes rather than 
read it here — and quite probably 
disbelieve what you read. 

"The 'closet' from which you 
have just stepped is, as you have 
by now realized, a time machine. 
From it you stepped into the 
world of 2004. The date is April 
7th, just fifty years from the time 
you last remember. 

"You cannot return. 

"I did this to you and you may 
hate me for it; I do not know. 
That is up to you to decide, but 
it does not matter. What does 
matter, and not to you alone, is 
another decision which you must 



HALL OF MIRRORS 



91 



make. I am incapable of making 
it. 

"Who is writing this to you? I 
would rather not tell you just 
yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is 
not signed (for I knew you would 
look first for a signature), I will 
not need to tell you who I am. 
You will know. 

*'I am seventy-five years of 
age. I have, in this year 2004, 
been studying 'time 1 for thirty 
of those years. I have completed 
the first time machine ever built 
— and thus far, its construction, 
even the fact that it has beenconstructed, is my own secret. 

"You have just participated in 
the first major experiment. It 
will be your responsibility to decide whether there shall ever be 
any more experiments with it, 
whether it should be given to the 
world, or whether it should be 
destroyed and never used again." 

END of- the first page. You 
look up for a moment, hesitating to turn the next page. Already you suspect what is coming. 

You turn the page. 

'*! constructed the first time 
machine a week ago. My calculations had told me that it would 
work, but not how it would work. 
I had expected it to send an ob- * 
ject back in time — it works backward in time only, not forward — 



physically unchanged and intact. 

"My first experiment showed 
me my error. I placed a cube of 
metal in the machine — it was a 
miniature of the one you just 
walked out of— and set the machine to go backward ten years. I 
flicked the switch and opened 
the door, expecting to find the 
cube vanished. Instead I found it 
had crumbled to powder. 

"I put in another cube and sent 
it two years back. The second 
cube came back unchanged, except that it was newer, shinier, 

"That gave me the answer. I 
had been expecting the cubes to 
go back in time, and they had 
done so, but not in the sense I 
had expected them to. Those 
metal cubes had been fabricated 
about three years previously. I 
had sent the first one back years 
before it had existed in its fabricated form. Ten years ago it had 
been ore. The machine returned it 
to that state. 

"Do you see how our previous 
theories of time travel have been 
wrong? We expected to be able 
to step into a time machine in, 
say, 2004, set it for fifty years 
back, and then step out in the 
year 1954 . . . but it does not 
work that way. The machine 
does not move in time. Only 
whatever is within the machine 
is affected, and then just with 
relation to itself and not to the 
rest of the Universe. 



92 




 



"I confirmed this with guinea 
pigs by sending one six weeks 
old five weeks back and it came 
out a baby. 

"I need not outline all my experiments here. You will find, a 
record of them in the desk and 
you can study it later. 

"Do you understand now what 
has happened to you, Norman?" 

"VT'OU begin to understand. And 
you begin to sweat. 

The / who wrote that letter 
you are now reading is you, 
yourself at the age of seventyfive, in this year of 2004. You 
are that seventy-five-year-old 
man, with your body returned to 
what it had been fifty years ago, 
with all the memories of fifty 
years of "living wiped out. 

You invented the time machine. 

And before you used it on 
yourself, you made these arrangements to help you orient yourself. You wrote yourself the letter 
which you are now reading. 

But if those fifty years are — to 
you — gone, what of all your 
friends, those you loved? What 
of your parents? What of the girl 
you are going — were going — to 
marry? 

You read on: 

"Yes, you will want to know 
what has happened. Mom died in 
1963, Dad in 1968. You married 
Barbara in 1956. I am sorry to 



tell you that she died only three 
years later, in a plane crash. You 
have one son. He is still living; 
his name is Walter; he is now 
forty-six years old and is an accountant in Kansas City." 

Tears come into your eyes and 
for .a moment you can no longer 
read. Barbara dead — dead for 
forty-five years. And only minutes ago, in subjective time, you 
were sitting next to her, sitting 
in the bright sun in a Beverly 
Hills patio . . . 

You force yourself to read 
again. 

"But back to the discovery. 
You begin to see some of its 
implications. You will need time 
to think to see all of them. 

"It does not permit time travel 
as we have thought of time travel, but it gives us immortality of 
a sort. Immortality of the kind 
I have temporarily given us. 

"Is it good? Is it worth while to 
lose the memory of fifty years of 
one's life in order to return one's 
body to relative youth? The only 
way I can find out is to try, as 
soon as I have finished writing 
this and made my other preparations. 

"You will know the answer. 

"But before you decide, remember that there is another 
problem, more important than 
the psychological one. I mean 
overpopulation. 

"If our discovery is given to 



HALL OF MIRRORS 



93 



the world, if all who are old or 
dying can make themselves 
young again, the population will 
almost double every generation. 
Nor would the world — not even 
our own relatively enlightened 
country — be willing to accept 
compulsory birth control as a 
solution. 

"Give this to the world, as the 
world is today in 2004, and within a generation there will be famine, suffering, war. Perhaps a 
complete collapse of civilization. 

"Yes, we have reached other 
planets, but they are not suitable 
for colonizing. The stars may 
be our answer, but we are a long 
way from reaching them. When 
we do, someday, the billions of 
habitable planets that must be 
out there will be our answer . . . 
our living room. But until then, 
what is the answer? 

"Destroy the machine? But 
think of the countless lives it can 
save, the suffering it can prevent. Think of what it would 
mean to a man dying of cancer. 
Think . . 




IH1NK. You finish the letter 
and put it down. 



You think of Barbara dead for 
forty-five years. And of the fact 
that you were married to her for 
three years and that those years 
are lost to you. 

Ffty years lost. You damn the 
old man of seventy -five whom 



you became and who has done 
this to you . . . who has given you 
this decision to make. 

Bitterly, you know what the 
decision must be. You think that 
he knew, too, and realize that he 
could safely leave it in your 
hands. Damn him, he should 
have known. 

Too valuable to destroy, too 
dangerous to give. 

The other answer is painfully 
obvious. 

You must be custodian of this 
discovery and keep it secret until 
it is safe to give, until mankind 
has expanded to the stars and 
has new worlds to populate, or 
until, even without that, he has 
reached a state of civilization 
where he can avoid overpopulation by rationing births to the 
number of accidental — or voluntary — deaths. 

If neither of those things has 
happened in another fifty years 
(and are they likely so soon?), 
then you, at seventy-five, will be 
writing another letter like this 
one. You will be undergoing another experience similar to the 
one you're going through now. 
And making the same decision, 
of course. 

Why not? You'll be the same 
person again. 

Time and again , to preserve 
this secret until Man is ready for 
it. 

How often will you again sit 



94 



GALAXY SCIf NCE FICTION 



at a desk like this one, thinking 
the thoughts you are thinking 
now, feeling the grief you now 
feel? 

There is a click at the door and 
you know that the time lock has 
opened, that you are now free 
to leave this room, free to start 
a new life for yourself in place of 
the one you have already lived 
and lost. 



But you are in no hurry now to 
walk directly through that door. 

You sit there, staring straight 
ahead of you blindly, seeing in 
your mind's eye the vista of a set 
of facing mirrors, like those in 
an old-fashioned barber shop, reflecting the same thing over and 
over again, diminishing into far 
distance.

WHO'S PREDICTING? 

Wrote G. K. Chesterton in The Napoleon of Notiing HilU "The human 
race, to which so many of my readers belong, has been playing at children's 
games from the beginning . . . and one of the games to which it is most 
attached is called . . . 'Cheat the Prophet.' The players listen very carefully 
and respectfully to all that the clever men have to say about what is to 
happen in the next generation. The players then wait until all the clever 
men are dead, and bury them nicely. They then go and do something else. 
That is all. For a race of simple tastes, however, it is great fun." 

Nobody is more whimsical than a supposedly practical man, and nobody 
is more adept at hanging millstones on progress; 

"What, ride a horse when I still have a pair of good legs?" "Fulton's 
Folly is right; wind is the only way to sail." "Get a horse!" J 'lt is mathematically demonstrable that a heavier-than-air craft cannot get off the 
ground." "Suicide ships, that's what planes are." "Rockets are all right for 
toys, but that's all." "Okay, so we can send an unmanned rocket 250 miles 
up, but who'd be crazy enough to get inside it?" 

That is where mankind is now, having dragged the millstone high above 
Earth. The next arguments ore predictable: "Sure, we can put an artificial 
satellite 1000 miles out In space, but we'll never reach the Moon." "All 
right, we got to the Moon, but the planets are a different matter." "Yes, but 
the planets are right in our own solar system; it would take centuries to 
reach even the nearest star . . ." 

Mankind will not run out of millstones or progress.

Suffer from De/um/nescence? 
Dementia Recap? Here's what 
to do till the doctor comes . . . 
many centuries from nowi 

Illustrated by STONE 



Dementia Reca pitulatica : 

atrophy of the cortex and of 
bilateral areas in the temporal 
and frontal lobes, characterized 
by overlapping of past and present thoughts. 

X^TIOLOGY: The rejuvenizing 
drug that the Egn'nootys of 
Botein III use to reverse the 
processes of growth causes de


mentia recapitulatica. Llaro Fsapilt (2906-2949) discovered the 
drug and was the first Egn'nooty 
to use it. His fear of aging impelled him to find a way of nullifying the process; and when at 
last he perfected the drug, he 
drank it eagerly. Unfortunately, 
he downed an overdose and regressed to an embryo before his 
assistant could help him. 



96 




 



Following users have shown 
more caution. At some point in 
their middle years they take the 
drug, regress to infancy, then once 
more proceed through childhood 
and adolescence. As the Egn'nootys re-approach maturity, 
however, there is the onset of 
cortical and lobar atrophy, and 
the symptoms of dementia recap 
manifest themselves. 

Symptoms and Signs; Past and 
present thoughts overlap, and the 
patient is unable to utilize recalled material in forming new 
concepts. One sufferer may become depressed, irritable, and 
suspicious, his previous personality acting as a shadowy hangover. 
Anothe r may become euphoric , 
happily exchanging childhood 
reminiscences with himself. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis: Like 
the Egn'nootys, the Ghlenopys 
of Klinebly VI are humanoid and 
suffer cortical and lobar atrophy. 
But they should present no diagnostic problem, for the etiology 
and symptomatology of their condition differ from those of dementia recap. In the case of the 
Ghlenopys, obstetricians deliver 
viable foetuses at varying periods 
before full term. This is because 
of the special qualities inhering in 
each stage as the foetus recapitulates the evolution of the race. 

The three months foetus has 
vibrissal feelers and strong pincers that equip it for tunneling. 




The four month foetus has ballast 
ports and snorkel tubes that fit it 
for diving. The five month foetus 
has a thick lanugo — an atavistic 
hairy coat — that enables it to 
withstand freezing temperatures. 
The six month foetus has adhesive digits that let it walk on 
the walls and ceiling of a room; 
this ability is invaluable in a 
spaceship during free flight, and 
many six month Ghlenopy foetuses grow to be crewmen. The 
seven month foetus becomes the 
humanoid type. 

Because the Ghlenopys have 
been practicing this form of birth 
control universally, no one has 
any idea what the full tei m 
Ghlenopy would be like. The 
Ghlenopy foetus readily adapts to 
its atrophied state and shows no 
symptoms beyond those common 
to immaturity.

The dementia recap sufferer, 
with proper treatment, may hope 
to live a relatively normal existence. 

Treatment: Occupational therapy best serves both society and 
the patient. The dementia recap 
sufferer finds his groove in teaching history, writing poetry, or 
ghost-writing political speeches. 



Tirudner Syndrome : thallophytic infection of the skin characterized by concurrent rashes, 
blisters, lesions, devil's pinches 
(purpura simplex), crusting, scaling and oozing, 

Tj 1 TIOLOGY : Responding to 
the needs of their Acropaani 
host, parasitic algae produce antigenic substances. These antigens 
cause various types of eruptions 
to appear on the sensitized skin 
of the host. 

Symptoms and Signs : The 
eruptions appear suddenly, coinciding with meeting a stranger. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis: The 
multiple symptoms, together with 
their instantaneous development, 
make the Tirudner syndrome 
easily distinguishable from other 
skin infections. The prognosis is 
excellent when there is understanding on the part of the observer. 

Treatment : The physician 




must not allow the symptoms to 
paralyze him. Viewing the patient 
with philosophic detachment, he 
must use cool kindness and frank 
friendliness to reassure the patient. This was the example Dr. 
Ernest L. Tirudner (3021-3150) 
set when he met an Acropaani. 

It happened in 3102, on the 
First Solar Expedition to Murzim VI. Dr. Tirudner was in the 
landing party when they encountered an Acropaani at the outskirts of a town. 

Upon seeing the strangers, the 
humanoid Acropaani's short fine 
hair encrusted with purple algae 
became almost invisible beneath 
a horrifying assortment of sores 
that blossomed before their eyes. 
Only strong indoctrination in contact methodology prevented the 
men from fleeing in fear or blasting the Acropaani down. 



98 




 



TAR. Tirudner ordered the crewman carrying the force-projector to throw up a protective 
screen, but it was too late. All 
.of the men began itching unbearably. Several threw up. Dr. 
Tirudner ignored his own discomfort to examine the others. 

Finding nothing somatically 
wrong with any of the party, he 
decided that the itching and vomiting were subjective responses to 
the symptomatic appearance of 
the Acropaani. He quickly administered a hypnotic booster of 
contact methodology. The itching and vomiting stopped. 

Dr. Tirudner ordered the party 
to return to the spaceship. He 
himself moved to a safe distance 
from the Acropaani and lowered 
the protective screen. Using remote controls he ran out the 
servo-mechanical diagnoser. 

The Acropaani didn't budge, 
but submitted to a thorough job 
of diagnosis. < 

Dr. Tirudner could recognize, 
from where he stood, the symptoms of measles, chickenpox. 
smallpox, mumps, scarlet fever, 
cellulitis, lymphadenitis, typhoid 
fever, cutaneous anthrax, bubonic 
plague, tularemia, tsutsugamushi 
disease, cutaneous leishmaniasis, 
leprosy, yaws, coccidioidomycosis, chromoblasto mycosis, rhinosporidiosis. 

But through the diagnoser he 
ruled out all those diseases. He 



found there was no basis for suspecting bacteria or viruses or 
fungi. He discovered the presence 
of the algae, and realized that 
the disorder was totally innocuous — that the syndrome was a 
protective device: The Acropaani 
was attempting to keep strangers 
from the town by displaying 
symptoms of most of the infectious diseases Dr. Tirudner had 
heard of. It was a scatter technique: one of the symptoms must 
suggest a disease that a stranger 
feared. 

It was analogous to the way 
the quadruple-jointed kresar of 
Rigel IX simulates liquescence 
and flows away from its nesting 
place to divert intruders from its 
young, and to the way the mineral metabolizers of Denebola VI 
become radioactive to render 
themselves unappetizing to creatures of prey. 

Dr. Tirudner convinced the 
Acropaani that the Solarians 
wished to be friends. The symptoms vanished when Dr. Tirudner doled out a placebo to the 
Acropaani and treated him to a 
creaky display of witch-doctor 
dancing as a face-saving expedient for the patient's ego. 



Periodic Deluminescence: a 

condition characterized by intermittent inability to light up. 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC MEDICINE 



99 



* ¥ji TIOLOGY: Periodic deluminescence is a form of conversion hysteria. The cause is a 
psychic disturbance. By its very 
nature, the condition is peculiar 
to the Ahimntuy race of humanoids on Fomalhaut III. The skin 
of an Ahimntuy has six different 
kinds of pigment cells. 

There are strawberry, raspberry, cherry, orange, lemon, and 
lime colors. 

The pigment cells have muscular walls that contract and expand. This shrinking and swelling enables the skin to take on a 
large variety of hues, tints, and 
shades, which are the Ahimntuy's 
means of communicating. The 
pigments are bioluminescent, so 
darkness does not bar conversation. 

The phenomenon of periodic 
deluminescence began in antiquity. 

A possible legendary wandering revivalist, an Ahimntuy by 
the name of Sesamhi, had appeared in the city of Ehlmos. It 
was the time of the Festival of 
the East Wind, and pilgrims 
thronged the streets. Sesamhi 
chose a busy crossroad and began to preach. 

The officer on the beat saw 
that the revivalist was blocking 
traffic, and flashed a loud plaid 
order to move on. 

But Sesamhi stood still', smiling 
sadly at the officer. The officer 



clashed his colors in rage. He 
broke through the crowd and 
grabbed Sesamhi. 

Sesamhi answered the officer's 
wrath softly, in pastels. Disregarding Sesamhi's remarks, the 
officer dragged him before the 
magistrates of Ehlmos. 

The magistrates asked Sesamhi 
his name. His pigment cells remained inert. They asked again. 
He gave no response beyond the 




pale smile. The inquisitors 
thought there was something 
fishy (apologies to ichthyoids) 
about his failure to respond, seeing his recalcitrant behavior as a 
threat to the whole structure of 
government. 

So they resorted to more forcible means of cross-questioning. 
While they tortured him they 
mocked him, dyeing parts of his 



100 




 



body in foul groupings of assorted colors. 

Sesamhi's heart gave out. At 
this crucial moment he flashed 
weakly what he had tried to tell 
the arresting officer — that he was 
color blind. Long fasting had 
caused a vitamin deficiency that 
atrophied his fovea. 

But because they had not 
known, he forgave them. Then he 
died. 

Sheepishly, they dumped his 
pastel body in an abandoned 
quarry. 

T>UT that was not the last of 
Sesamhi. Ahimntuy whispered to Ahimntuy in subdued 
colors, and what they whispered 
was that Sesamhi had not really 
died — that a faithful follower had 
seen life in the body and had 
spirited him from Fomalhaut III 
to another world. 

As the story grew it gathered 
momentum and became an irresistible force, rainbow-shouted. 
The following year, at the time of 
the Festival of the East Wind, the 
first cases of periodic deluminescence appeared. Since then, 
yearly attacks of periodic deluminescence have become an almost universal phenomenon on 
Fomalhaut III. 

Psychoanalysts theorize that it 
arises from unconscious conflict, 
which comes about when the Festival of the East Wind sharply 



reminds the Ahimntuy of Sesamhi. The Ahimntuy projects 
himself into Sesamhi's place and 
suffers the same frustration. And 
periodic deluminescence defends 
the ego from recognizing the infantile wishes, hostilities, and 
guilt feelings that are reawakened. 

Symptoms and Signs: Rising 
body temperature; inability to 
luminesce when conversing in 
darkness. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis: Periodic deluminescence is easy to 
differentiate from organic disorders, malingering, and schizophrenia. Body temperature soars, 
though not high enough to affect 
the enzyme which catalyzes bioluminescence. Bioluminescence 
would therefore still be under nervous control ; this .indicates that 
the breakdown is due to hysteria. 
The onset of the symptoms at the 
time of the Festival of the East 
Wind is highly significant. The 
attack lasts three days, clearing 
up afterward of its own accord. 

Treatment; The patient should 
rest his pigment cells and meditate rather than try to talk in 
darkness. 



Larritonia Fever: an acute 
disease of the central nervous 
system characterized by involuntary clapping. 

10! 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC "MEDICINE 



T?T10L0GY: Direct contact is 
the source of infection. Healthy carriers are often the cause 
of outbreaks. The larritonia virus 
enters the body through a break 
in the skin, invades .the blood 
stream by way of the lymphatic 
channels, and attacks the brain, 
cord, and peripheral nerves by 
causing thiamine deficiency. 

Symptoms and Signs : As degeneration progresses, the patient 
increasingly demonstrates irrational thought, marked impairment of perception and loss of 
muscular control. The last evidences itself in seeing double. The 
patient reaches out confusedly, 
seeking to press into register the 
external objects which he sees as 
double images. To observers, this 




appears to be a clapping gesture. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis: The 
peculiar clapping gesture differentiates larritonia fever from all 
other diseases of the central nervous system. The condition is 
slowly progressive but is compatible with long life. Incapacitation is gradual and increasing. 

Prevention: Identification and 
isolation of carriers are essential. 

Treatment: Thiamine, 20 to 50 
mg. or more, according to metabolic rate and physiological type, 
intramuscularly or intravenously 
daily. Lheet, 3,000 cc. daily. 
CAUTION: On Cottenda XII, 
special care is necessary when 
administering lheet. Cottendans 
are marsupialoids with a pouch 
high on the back. This pouch 
holds a plant and a solution of 
nutrient salts. The plant grows 
with its roots dipped in the solution. In return for the nutrient 
salts, the plant disposes of excess carbon dioxide and provides 
leafy shade. Lheet upsets the 
symbiotic balance by draining 
the solution. This withers the 
plant and asphyxiates the Cottendan. 

1%/JOST Cottendans have a tremendous craving for lheet, 
however. Too often in their history this craving has mastered 
their judgment. After a lheet orgy 
in 2610 threatened to wipe out 
the race, the surviving .Cotten


102 




 



dans banned the use of Iheet except for medicinal purposes. 
1 In 3090 a new outbreak of larritonia fever began to sweep 
around the planet. Dr. Grevan 
Tisoti (3051-3126), a Terran exchange doctor, soon pinpointed 
the source of infection. It was 
a larritonia - carrying individual 
peddling his infectious touch. 

Lheet-craving Cottendans willing to pay the price in credits 
and health were buying the disease to get the cure! 

Dr. Tisoti rushed to alert the 
civil authorities. They greeted 
him with applause. He told them 
of his discovery and gave them 
his advice. They applauded, and 
asked him to repeat his words. 
He repeated them over and over, 
each time to wilder applause. 
Then they asked him to submit 
his findings in writing — in Cottendan hieroglyphs. 

Dr. Tisoti realized the cost of 
delay. He also realized that the 
official bodies were suffering from 
larritonia fever, and that he could 
expect no cooperation. 

Without wasting further time 
and breath, he returned to his lab. 
There he prepared a large 
amount of a soporific. He loaded 
it on his copter and flew to the 
government warehouse containing all the lheet on Cottenda. He 
overpowered the guards (Cottendans are two feet high), 
entered the building and adult


erated the lheet with soporific. 

When word spread that patients were sleeping through their 
doses of lheet instead of enjoying the effect, the outbreak of 
larritonia fever ended quickly. 
And just as quickly Dr. Tisoti 
found himself on a Terra-bound 
spaceship, the irritated authorities of Cottenda having invoked 
the law which forbade the distribution of sleeping-medicine 
without prescriptions. 



Incomplete Plasticizingi a 

malfunction of body covering, 
characterized by fluid condition 
of new-forming skin. 

XfTIOLOGY: This disorder 
-i-J affects the natives of Affhiltu 
IX, a treeless, grassy, muggy and 
very small planet. Faithfully, 
every three of their years, the 
igneous rock underlying the crust 
of their planet had superheated 
the ground water into steam, activating a belt of geysers. The 
body chemistry of the natives had 
adapted to the cycle. Every three 
years their thermoplastic skin 
was ready to shed. Their body 
exuded a colloidal liquid which 
was the basis of their new skin. 
With perfect timing the geysers 
jetted steam. The natives paraded 
through the steam and the colloidal coating coagulated, form

ing a gel. This gave them a 
spanking new weatherproof, waterproof skin. 

But in 3030 the cycle broke 
down. The belt of geysers encircling the globe failed to spout 
on schedule. The natives tried to 
keep their old skin from sloughing off, but soon found that 
patching up was a losing struggle. 
They begged their gods for help. 

A crippled Terran spaceship 
made a landing, its crew hoping 
to find materials for the repairs 
the ship needed. 

The natives rejoiced, believing 
that the spacemen were heavenly 
messengers. The natives had 
prayed to their gods, and now 
everything would be made right 
again. 

The heavenly messengers tried 
to keep from looking dismayed. 
They were willing to help, if they 
could, in return for the materials they needed. But they 
lacked facilities for processing ten 
billion beings. Yet if they failed 
to solve the problem, they would 
be revealed as false gods, and 
would find the natives raging 
against them. Then they might 
not get what they needed, or 
live to use it if they got it. 

Symptoms and Signs: The patient exhibits a reticulating outer 
skin that floats uneasily over the 
unplasticized inner skin. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis: The 
reticulating and sliding of outer 



skin simplify diagnosis. Incomplete plasticizing responds readily to proper treatment. * 
Treatment: Dr. Mike Nagel 
(2996-3098) was the surgeon of 
the Terran spaceship. He picked 
a random sampling of natives for 
studying. He tested them and 
found that their body temperature was much higher than the 
Terrans*, and that they were allergic to certain Terran sub



¥~kR. Nagel sweated to find the 
solution. But he didn't know 
he had come up with it until a 
native, in a frenzy of devotion, 
pressed lips to the doctor's palm. 
The heavenly messenger looked 
on bug-eyed at what followed. 

The native writhed, fainted, 
and fell to the floor of the sick 
bay. His outer skin sloughed off. 



104 




 



The new skin began to firm up. 
Dr. Nagel quickly took the native's temperature. It had risen 
25° F. above normal. 

The doctor scraped the sweaty 
palm the native had kissed and 
analyzed the scrapings. His findings: the sweat had caused the 
native to run the high fever, the 
fever heat had caused the colloidal coating to coagulate. 

Meanwhile the native came to, 
got up, saw his new skin, danced 
out. Dr. Nagel knew he would 
spread the news, and got busy. 
The crew turned a compartment 
into a turkish bath. At the end of 
three months they had collected 
enough sweat for global distribution. 

The grateful natives heaped 
upon the spacemen the materials 
they needed, many times over. 
Soon the spaceship was in shape 
to go. 

The shock of its take-off jolted 
every geyser on the tiny planet 
into action. 

The natives stretched their 
new skins in frantic dance at this 
parting gift. 



Infectious Keratolysis: a communicable disease characterized 
by a moth-eaten appearance. 

TJTIOLOGY: Salicylic acidforming bacilli cause infec



tious keratolysis. The acid attacks the carapace of chelonoids, 
the cell walls of fungoids, the hair 
and nails of humanoids. 

Symptoms and Signs: The 
onset is insidious, the typical 
moth-eaten appearance becoming 
evident only in the latter stages 
of the disease. 

Diagnosis and Prognosis : A 
moth-eaten appearance may be 
misleading without the supporting evidence of the salicylic acid 
and the bacilli. The classical example is the mistaken diagnosis 
of Dr. O. Redmeld (3616-3666). 

Dr. Redmeld was a Ganymedan 
medical missionary to Ganap III. 
He found it a paradise of untouched splendor. The dominant 
form of life was a primitive society of beautiful winged creatures who spent their days flourishing their bright colors in the 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC MEDICINE 



105 



gold-moted air. Dr. Redmeld arrived at a Ganap settlement in 
3640. The Ganapi smilingly welcomed him, then continued weaving their kaleidoscopic patterns 
in the sky. 

Determining to get the lie of 
the land, Redmeld boldly struck 
into the surrounding forest. Before he had gone very far, a loud 
crashing stopped him. The cause 
of the noise followed it shortly. 

The creature was vegetarian, 
but the doctor didn't know that 
at the time. He saw the long 
armored body, the huge jaws, the 
waving antennae, the three pairs 
of propelling legs, the several 
pairs of prolegs armed with hooks 
— and he drew his gun and fired. 

The creature heaved a bit, then 
lay still. The shot had split off 
a section of armor. Dr. Redmeld 
could see that something had 
been eating away at the inner 
surface of the armor. Its motheaten appearance immediately 
suggested infectious keratolysis 
to him. Without analyzing the 
fluid that saturated the inner portion of the armor, he felt sure 
that it was salicylic acid, teeming with bacilli. 

' I iHE thought of disease in this 
paradise appalled him. Another loud crashing broke through 
this thought. Another huge creature appeared. Seeing its dead 
fellow, it threw itself across the 



body and clicked its enormous 
jaws in mourning. Redmeld shivered and fired again. 

This creature's armor showed 
the menacing moth-eaten appearance too. 

Burning with zeal, Redmeld 
pushed through the forest. Singlehandedly he would root out the 
evil! He gripped his gun tightly, 
alert for his next encounter. 

But the next encounter took 
him by surprise. 

Three of the beautiful winged 
Ganapi came silently down and 
seized him. They flew him to a 
clearing where their tribunal sat 
in judgment. 

It was at his trial that he 
learned that the creatures he had 
killed were not carriers of infectious keratolysis. The moth-eaten 
appearance was due to molting 
fluid that had been busily digesting the chitin of the giant 
larvae, enabling the imago— the 
winged creature — to break out. 

The tribunal ruled that Redmeld might remain on Ganap III 
only if he agreed to limit his 
work to doctoring the superficial 
cuts and bruises of infant larvae. 
This he did. 

Prognosis is good; the mortality in infectious keratolysis is less 
than 1%." 

Treatment: The physician 
must first draw off the salicylic 
acid and neutralize affected areas 
with an alkaline solution. Then 



106 




 



he should administer an antibiotic. Ballpointin has been 
responsible for dramatic improvement. The initial basic dosage is 
4 grams daily, with decreasing 
doses as improvement becomes 
manifest. Some authorities recommend using lobdomycetin as a 
prophylactic against secondary 
invaders. The basic dosage is 
300,000 units given intravenously daily. 



Cosmetic or structural considerations may call for the use 
of plastic spray to fill in and 
smooth over the ravaged areas. 
As to color, the plastic spray may 
be in matching or contrasting 
hues. Many patients prefer the 
latter: a striking polka-dot "scar" 
provides a gambit for wedging 
one's operation into a conversation.

Forecast 

From the sparkling, immeasurably beautiful and efficient city of the future, 
an apprehensive hero goes forth to sell civilization to the hostile countryside. 
He is not a coward. Any man has a right to feel the touch of fear when he 
is given a suicidal assignment. For the cities vitally need the countryside . . . 
and the countryside has blockaded the cities for many bitterly antagonistic 
years. Nor is it a matter of cutting off noses to spite faces, as the hero incredulously finds out in next month's novella, NATURAL STATE, by Damon 
Knight. If you forget this acid-sharp obelisk of literary ingenuity in less than 
half a dozen years, your memory needs honing. But you won't forget it! 

Winston Marks' novelet, BACKLASH, is named after the infuriating tangle 
that a fishing line gets into when it spins back on the reel. It's a fishing expedition he writes about, in a way, but there's no doubt that it leaves mankind reeling! 

What with NATURAL STATE running long (and reading short), this looks 
like a packed issue, but we'll try to add another novelet— LULUNGOMEENA 
by Gordon R. Dickson. Don't let the exotic title mislead you. This far-distant 
station out in space is no home away from home! On the other hand, "home" 
has a lot to do with the adrenal-tense conflict and the explosive ending.

Conclusion of a 3-part serial 



The caves of steel 




The colonization of the Galaxy 
has come to a halt. Earth's eight 
billions live in huge enclosed 
Cities, in a culture so specialized 
and artificial that they can no 
longer break loose to establish 
colonies on new raw worlds. On 
the other hand, the fifty "Outer 



Worlds" — (Galactic colonies established tenturies earlier by an 
Earth that had not yet hardened 
entirely into its mold) — had developed into underpopulated societies of long-lived humans who 
made extensive use of robots in 
their economy. 

To restore humanity to a policy of expansion and growth, a

Baley no longer had to save Earth . 
in fact, was told not to. 

But when a man thinks he can, 
he'll try, no matter whatl 




small group of idealistic "Spacers" — (men of the Outer 
Worlds) — have established a mission in "Spacetown" just outside 
New York City and are attempting to introduce robots into 
Earth's Cities. In doing so, they 
hope to create a class of jobless 
men who will be willing to leave 
Earth tor other planets. 



This plan is not working. What 
is actually happening is that 
Earthmen are forming Medievalist organizations, groups dedicated to an anti-robot, anti-Spacer 
philosophy and to the belief that 
Earth's salvation is to be found 
in her primitive pre-City way of 
life. The philosophy is an attractive one. Even Julius Enderby, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



109 



New York City's Commissioner 
of Police, wears old-fashioned 
spectacles and has a genuine 
window in his private office. 

The conflict between Earthmen 
and Spacers is brought to a head 
by the murder of Dr. Roj Nemmenuh Sarton, a prominent Spacer, presumably by a Medievalist. 

Plainclothesman Elijah Baley 
is in charge of the investigation 
and is forced to take a Spacer 
partner named R. Daneel Olivaw, 
the R. standing for robot. So well 
designed is R. Daneel, however, 
that it is almost impossible to 
discover he is not human. 

Commissioner Enderby impresses upon Baley the fact that 
failure to solve the crime may not 
only result in an interstellar crisis, but may have the more immediate effect of hastening the 
gradual replacement of the human members of the Police Department by appropriate robots. 
Already, simple robots such as 
R. Sammy are serving as office 
boys. 

This would mean "declassification" for men like Baley. Declassification involves the loss of 
all special privileges above that 
of bare existence. Baley fears 
such a situation desperately since 
his father was declassified in 
Baley's infancy with tragic results for the entire family. 

Baley takes R. Daneel to his 
apartment and on the way the 



robot, by quick action, prevents 
an anti-robot riot at a shoe store. 
Baley's wife, Jessie — (/ier full 
name is Jezebel, but after a 
quarrel with her husband over 
the personality and character of 
the Biblical Jezebel, she no 
longer uses if) — learns of R. 
Daneel's robotic nature through 
some unspecified outside source. 
Jessie urges Baley to drop the 
case, even to resign from the 
Department if he has to. 

Instead, Baley travels to 
Spacetown and there accuses the 
Spacers of having set up a false 
crime for their own devious motives. He accuses them of having 
presented Police Commissioner 
Enderby, who happened to be in 
Spacetown at about the time of 
the crime, with a "corpse" that 
was actually the remains of a 
humanoid robot. Meanwhile, he 
claims, the real Dr. Sarton, the 
supposed murdered man, masqueraded about as the "robot," 
R. Daneel Olivaw. 

This theory is disproved by R. 
Daneel himself, who can open 
parts of his body to show his 
mechanical interior. Baley is 
forced to seek another solution. 

Later in the day, he and R. 
Daneel are pursued by a group of 
Medievalist zealots, whom they 
escape by making use of New 
York's rapid transit system and 
by passing through one of the 
nuclear power plants of the City. 



no 




 



In a last attempt to show that 
Earthmen were not involved in 
the murder, Baley consults Dr. 
Cerrigel, a roboticist, to see 
whether R. Daneel might be a 
robot designed without the First 
Law of Robotics — which states 
that a robot cannot hurt a human 
being. It is his theory that perhaps R. Daneet himself killed 
Dr. Sarton and hid the missing 
murder weapon in the only place 
no one had looked, i.e. in the 
interior of the robot's own body. 
Dr. Gerrigel assures Baley this 
is impossible. 

In the privacy of the Commissioner's office — Enderby himself 
being away at the time — R. 
Daneel then turns the tables by 
inquiring into the activity of 
Baley's wife, Jessie. How did 
Jessie learn that R. Daneel is a 
robot? Me accuses her of being 
a member of an underground 
M edievalist organization. Baley 
fights this bitterly since, if it were 
true, it could mean declassification for both of them. Even as 
he does so, R. Sammy, the robot 
office boy, announces that Jessie, 
in a great state of agitation, 
wishes to see her husband. 

XIV 

BALEY remained standing, 
in a tetany of shock, as 
Jessie ran to him, seized 
his shoulders, huddled close. 



His pale lips formed the word, 
"Bentley?" 

She looked at him and shook 
her head. "He's all right." 

"Well, then?" 

Jessie said through a sudden 
torrent of sobs, in a low voice 
that could scarcely be made out, 
"I can't go on, Lije. I can't sleep 
or eat. I've got to tell you!" 

"Don't say anything," Baley 
said in anguish. "For God's sake, 
Jessie, not now!" 

"I must. I've done a terrible 
thing — " 

Baley said hopelessly, "We're 
not alone, Jessie." 

She looked up and stared at 
R. Daneel with no sign of recognition. The tears in which her 
eyes were swimming were evidently refracting the robot into 
a featureless blur. 

R. Daneel said, "Good afternoon, Jessie." 

She gasped. "Is it the — the 
robot?" She dashed the back of 
her hand across her eyes and 
stepped out of Baley's encircling 
right arm. She breathed deeply 
and, for a moment, a tremulous 
smile wavered on her lips. "It is 
you, isn't it?" 

"Yes, Jessie." 

"You don't mind being called 
a robot. " 

"No, Jessie. That is what I 

am." 

"And I don't mind being called 
a fool and an idiot and a — a sub


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



111 



versive agent, because that's what 
/ am." 

"Jessie!*' groaned Baley. 

"It's no use, Lije," she said. 
"He might as well know — he's 
your partner. I don't care if I go 
to jail. I don't care if they send 
me down to the lowest levels and 
make me live on raw yeast and 
water. I don't care if — You wop't 
let them, will you, Lije? Don't 
let them do anything to me! I'm 
frightened!" 

Baley patted her shoulder and 
let her cry. He said to R. Daneel. 
"She isn't well. We can't keep 
her here. What time is it?" 

R. Daneel replied without visibly consulting a timepiece, 
"Fourteen-forty-five." 

"The Commissioner may be 
back any minute. We'd better 
commandeer a squad-car. We can 
talk this over in the Motorway." 

Jessie's head jerked upright. 
"The Motorway? Oh, no, Lije." 

He said, in as soothing a tone 
as he could manage, "Now, Jessie, 
don't be superstitious. You can't 
go on the Expressway the way 
you are. Be a good girl and calm 
down or we won't even be able 
to go through the office." 

CHE wiped her face with a 
^ damp handkerchief and said 
drearily, "Oh, look at my makeup." 

"Don't worry about your 
makeup," said Baley. "Daneel, 



what about the squad-car?" 

"It's waiting for us now, partner Elijah." 

"Come on, Jessie." 

"Wait — just a minute, Lije. 
I've got to do something to my 
face." 

"It doesn't matter now." 

But she twisted away. "Please! 
I can't go through the Common 
Room like this. I won't take a 
second." 

The man and the robot waited 
— the man impatiently, the robot 
impassively. 

Jessie rummaged through her 
purse for the necessary equipment. If there was one thing, 
Baley thought resignedly, that 
had resisted mechanical improvement since Medieval times, it 
was a woman's purse. Even the 
substitution of magnetic clotures 
for metal clasps had not proven 
successful. Jessie pulled out a 
small mirror and the silver-cased cosmeto-kit that Baley had 
bought her three birthdays before. 

The cosmeto-kit had several 
orifices and she used each in turn. 
All but the last spray were invisible. She used them with that 
fineness of touch and delicacy 
of control that seems to be the 
birthright of women from Sumerian to Galactic eras. 

The base went on first, in a 
smooth, even layer that removed 
all shininess and roughness from 



112 




 



the skin and gave it the light 
golden glow which long experience had taught Jessie was the 
shade best suited to the natural 
coloring of her hair and eyes. 
Then a touch of tan along the 
forehead and chin — a gentle 
brush of color on either cheek, 
tracing back to the angle of the 
jaw — a delicate drift of blue on 
the upper eyelids and along the 
earlobes F nally came the application of smooth carmine to the 
lips This involved the one visible spray, a delicate pink mist 
that glistened liquidly in air, but 
dried and deepened richly on contact with the lips. 

"There," said Jessie, with several swift pats at her hair and a 
look of deep dissatisfaction. "I 
suppose that will have to do." 

The process had taken more 
than the promised second, but 
less than fifteen. Nevertheless, it 
had seemed interminable to 
Baley. 

"Come on," he said. 

She barely had time to return 
the cosmeto-kit to the purse before he pushed her through the 
door. 

T^HE eerie silence of the Motorway lay thick on either side. 
Baley said, "AH right, Jessie. 
What did you do?" 

The impassivity that had 
masked Jessie's face since they 
left the Commissioner's office 



showed signs of cracking. She 
looked at her husband, then at 
Daneel in helpless silence. 

Baley said, "Get it over with, 
Jessie — please! Have you committed an actual crime?" 

"A crime?" She shook her head 
uncertainly. 

"No hysterics. Just say yes or 
no, Jessie. Have you — " he hesitated briefly — "killed anyone?" 

The look on Jessie's face was 
promptly changed to indignation. 
"Why, Lije Baley!" 
"Yes or no, Jessie." 
"No — of course not." 
The hard knot in Baley's 
stomach softened perceptibly. 
"Have you stolen anything? Falsified ration data? Assaulted anyone? Destroyed property? Speak 
up, Jessie." 

"I didn't mean anything like 
that." She looked over her shoulder. "Lije, do we have to stay 
down here?" 

"Until this is over.. Now start 
at the beginning. What did you 
come to tell us?" 

Jessie spoke in a soft voice. 
"It's these people, these Medievalists. You know, Lije — they're 
always around, always talking. 
Even in the old days, when I was 
an assistant dietician, it was 
like that. Remember Elizabeth 
Thornbowe?, She was a Medievalist. She was always talking 
about how all our troubles came 
from the City and how things 



THE CAVES OF 5TEEL 



113 



were better before the Cities 
started. 

"I used to asg her how she 
was so sure, especially after you 
and I met. Lije — remember the 
talks we used to have? — and 
then she'd quote Trom those small 
book-reels that are always floating around. You know, like 
Shame of the Cities that the fellow wrote. I don't remember his 
name." 

Baley said absently, "Ogrinsky 
and Lincoln Steffms. Centuries 
ago." 

"Yes, only most of the bookreels were lots worse. Then, when 
I married you, she was really 
sarcastic. She said, 'I suppose 
you're going to be a real City 
woman, now that you've married 
a policeman.' After that, she 
didn't talk to rne much and then 
I quit the job and that was that. 
Lots of things she used to say 
were just to shock me, I think, or 
to make herself look mysterious 
and glamorous. 

"She was an old maid, you 
know — never got married till the 
day she died. Lots of those Medievalists don't fit in, one way or 
another. Remember you once 
said, Lije, that people sometimes 
mistake their own shortcomings 
for those of society and want to 
fix the Cities because they don't 
know how to fix themselves." 

Baley remembered and his 
words now sounded flip and su


perficial in his own ears. He said 
gently, "Keep to the point, 
Jessie." 

SHE went on, "Anyway, Lizzy 
was always talking about how 
there'd come a day and people 
had to get together. She said it 
was all the fault of the Spacers 
because they wanted to keep 
Earth weak and decadent. That 
was one of her favorite words, 
'decadent.' She'd look at the 
menus I'd prepare for the next 
week and sniff and say, 'Decadent — decadent.' Jane Myers 
used to imitate her in the cookroom and we'd die laughing. 

"She said, Elizabeth did, that 
someday we were going to break 
up the Cities and go back to the 
soil and have an accounting with 
the Spacers, who were trying to 
tie us forever to the Cities by 
forcing robots on us. Only she 
never called them robots. She 
used to say 'soulless monster-machines' — if you'll excuse the expression, Daneel." 

The robot said, "I am not 
aware of the significance of the 
adjective used. Jessie, but in any 
case I am not offended. Please 
go on." 

Baley stirred restlessly. It was 
that way with Jessie. No emergency, no crisis, could make her 
tell a story in any but her own 
circuitous way. 

She said, "Elizabeth always 




 



tried to talk as though there were 
lots of people in it with her. She'd 
say, 'At the last meeting,' and 
then stop and look at me, sort of 
half -proud and half -scared, as 
though she wanted me to ask 
about it so she could look important, yet scared I might get 
her in trouble. Of course, I never 
asked her. I wouldn't give her 
the satisfaction. Anyway, after I 
married you, Lije, it was all over 
until . . ." 
She stopped. 

"Go on, Jessie," said Baley. 

"You remember that argument 
we had? About Jezebel, I mean?" 

It took a second or two for 
Baley to recall that was Jessie's 
own name and not a reference 
to another woman. 

He turned to R. Daneel in an 
automatically defensive explanation. "Jessie's full name is Jezebel. She is not fond of it and 
doesn't use it." 

R. Daneel nodded gravely and 
Baley thought: Jehosophat, why 
waste an explanation on him? 

"It bothered me a lot, Lije," 
Jessie said. "It really did. I guess 
it was silly, but I kept thinking 
and thinking about what you 
said. I mean about your saying 
that Jezebel was only a conservative who fought for the customs of her ancestors against 
the strange ones the newcomers 
had brought. After all, / was 
Jezebel and I always. . ." 



She groped for a word and 
Baley supplied it. "Identified 
yourself?" 

JESSIE shook her head and 
looked away. "Not really, of 
course — not literally — not the 
way I thought she was. I wasn't 
like that." 

"I know, Jessie. Don't be foolish." 

"But still I thought of her a lot 
and somehow I got to thinking 
that it's just the same now as it 
was then. I mean we Earth people had our old ways and here 
were the Spacers coming in with 
a lot of new ways and trying to 
encourage the new ways we had 
stumbled into ourselves, and 
maybe the Medievalists were 
right. Maybe we should go back 
to our good old ways. So I went 
and found Elizabeth." 

"Yes. Go on." 

"She said she didn't know what 
I was talking about, and besides 
I was a cop's wife. I said that had 
nothing to do with it and finally 
she said, well, she'd speak to 
somebody and then, about a 
month later, she came to me and 
said it was all right and I joined 
and I've been going to meetings 
ever since." 

Baley looked at her sadly. 
"And you never told me?" 

Jessie's voice trembled. "I'm 
sorry, Lije." 

"Well, that won't help — being 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



115 



sorry, I mean. I want to know 
about the meetings. In the first 
place, where were these klatsches 
held?" 

A sense of detachment was 
creeping over him, a numbing of 
emotions. What he had tried not 
to believe Vas so, unmistakably 
so. In a sense, it was a relief to 
know the truth, to have the uncertainty over. 

She said, "Down here." 

"Down here? You mean on this 
spot?" 

"Right in the Motorway. 
That's why I didn't want to come 
down here. It was a wonderful 
place to meet, though. We'd get 
together — " 

"How many?" 

"I'm not sure. Maybe sixty or 
seventy. It was just a sort of 
local branch- There'd be folding 
chairs and some refreshments and 
someone would make a speech. 
They were mostly about how 
wonderful life was in the old days 
and how someday we'd do away 
with the inonsters — the robots, 
that is — and the Spacers, too. 
The speeches were sort of dull, 
really, because they were all the 
same. We just endured them. 
Mostly it vas the fun of getting 
together arid feeling important. 
We would pledge ourselves to 
oaths and there'd be secret ways 
we could greet each other on the 
outside." 

"Weren't you ever interrupted? 



No squad-cars or fire-engines 

passed?" 

"No — never." 

T> DANEEL interrupted, "Is 
that unusual, Elijah?" 

"Maybe not," Baley answered 
thoughtfully. "There are some 
side-passages that are practically 
never used. It's quite a trick, 
knowing which they are, though. 
Is that all you did at the meetings, Jessie — make speeches and 
play at conspiracy?" 

"It's about all. We'd sing songs, 
sometimes. And, of course, we 
had refreshments. Nothing fancy 
— just sandwiches and juice." 

"In that case," he said almost 
brutally, "what's bothering you?" 

Jessie winced. "You're angry." 

"Please!" said Baley, with iron 
patience. "Answer my question. 
If it's as harmless as that, why 
have you been in such a panic 
for the last day and a half?" 

"I thought they would hurt 
you, Lije. For heaven's sake, why 
do you act as though you don't 
understand? I've explained it to 
you." 

"No, you haven't — not yet. 
You've told me about a harmless 
little kaffee-klatsch you belonged 
to. Did they ever hold open demonstrations? Did they ever destroy robots — start riots — kill 
people?" 

"Never! Lije, I wouldn't do any 
of those things. I wouldn't stay 



116 




 



a member if they tried it." 

"Well, then, why do you say 
youVe done a terrible thing? Why 
do you expect to be sent to jail?" 

"They used to talk about someday when they'd put pressure on 
the government. We were supposed to get organized and then 
afterward there would be strikes 
and work stoppages. We could 
force the government to ban all 
robots and make the Spacers go 
back where they came from. I 
thought it was just talk and then 
this thing started — -about you and 
Daneel, I mean. 

"Then they said, 'Now we'll see 
action,' and, 'We're going to make 
an example of them and put a 
stop to the robot invasion right 
now.' Right there in Personal, 
they said it, not knowing it was 
you they were talking about. But 
/ knew — right away." 

Her voice broke. 

Baley softened. "Come on, 
Jessie. It was just talk. You can 
see for yourself that nothing has 
happened." 

"I was so — so scared. And I 
thought, I'm part of it. If there 
was going to be killing and destruction, you might be killed, 
and Bentley, and somehow it 
would be all — my fault for taking 
part in it, and I ought to be sent 
to jail." 

Baley let her sob herself out. 
He put his arm about her shoulder and stared tight-lipped at R. 



Daneel, who gazed calmly back. 

He said, "Who was the head 
of your group?" 

^HE was quieter now, patting 
^ the corners of her eyes with a 
handkerchief. "A man called Joseph Klemin was the leader, but 
he wasn't really anybody. He 
wasn't more than five feet four 
inches tall and I think he was 
terribly henpecked at home. I 
don't think there's any harm in 
him. You aren't going to arrest 
him, are you, Lije — not on my 
say-so?" She looked guiltily troubled. 

"I'm not arresting anyone just 
yet. How did Klemin get his 
instructions?" 

"I don't know." 

"Did any strangers come to 
the meetings? You know what I 
mean — big shots from Central 
Headquarters?" 

"Sometimes people would come 
to make speeches. That wasn't 
very often — maybe twice a year 
or so." 

"Can you name them?" 

"No. They were always just 
introduced as 'one of us* or 'a 
friend from Jackson Heights' or 
wherever." 

"I see. Daneel!" 

"Yes, Elijah." 

"Describe the men you think 
you've tabbed. We'll see if Jessie 
can recognize them." 

R, Daneel went through the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



117 



list with clinical exactness. Jessie 
listened with an expression of 
dismay. As the categories of 
physical measurements lengthened, she shook her head with increasing firmness. 

"It's no use, no use at all," she 
cried. "How can I remember how 
any of them looked? I can't . . ." 
She stopped and seemed to consider. "Did you say one of them 
was a yeast farmer?" 

"Francis Clousarr," said R. 
Daneel, "is an employee at New 
York Yeast." 

"Well, once a man was making a speech and I happened to 
be sitting in the first row and I 
kept getting a whiff — just a whiff 
really — of raw yeast. You know 
what I mean, The only reason I 
remember is that I had an upset 
stomach that day and the smell 
kept making me sick. I had to 
stand up and move to the back 
and of course I couldn't explain 
what was wrong. It was so embarrassing. Maybe that's the man 
you're speaking of. After all, 
when you work with yeast all 
the time, the odor gets to stick 
to your clothes." 

"You don't remember what he 
looked like?" asked Baley. 

"No," she replied with decision. 

"All right, then. Look, Jessie, 
I'm going to take you to your 
mother's. Bentley will stay with 
you and none of you will leave 
the Section. Ben can stay home 



from school and I'll arrange to 
have meals sent in and the corriridors around the apartment 
watched by the police." 

"What about you?" quavered 
Jessie. . 

"I'll be in no danger." 

"But how long will we have to 
stay?" 

"I don't know. Maybe just a 
day or two." The words sounded 
hollow "even to himself. 

HpHEY were back in the Motor -■- way, Baley and R. Daneel — 
alone now. Baley's expression was 
dark. 

"It looks to me," he said, "as 
if we're up against an organization built up on two levels. First, 
a ground level with no specific 
program, designed only to supply 
mass support for an eventual 
coup. Secondly, a much smaller 
elite dedicated to a well -planned 
program of action. It is this elite 
we must find. The comic-opera 
groups Jessie spoke of can be 
ignored." 

"All this," said R. Daneel, "follows if we can take Jessie's story 
at face value." 

"I think we can," Baley said 
stiffly. 

"So it would/'' seem," said R. 
Daneel. "There is nothing about 
her cerebro-impulses that would 
indicate a pathological addiction 
to lying." 

Baley turned an offended look 



118 




 



upon the robot. "I should say 
not! And there will be no necessity to mention her name in our 
reports. Do you understand 
that?" 

"If you wish it so, partner 
Elijah," said R. Daneel calmly, 
"but our report will then be 
neither complete nor accurate." 

Baley said, "Maybe not K but 
no real harm will be done. She 
came to us with whatever information she had and mentioning her name will only put her 
in the police records. I don't want 
that to happen." 

"In that case, certainly not — 
provided we are certain nothing 
more remains to be found- out." 

"Nothing as far as she's concerned. My guarantee." 

"Could you then explain why 
the word Jezebel, the mere sound 
of a name, should lead her to 
abandon previous convictions and 
assume a new set? The motivation seems obscure." 

They were traveling- slowly 
through the curving empty tunnel. 

Baley said. "Jezebel is a rare 
name. It once belonged to a woman of very bad reputation. My 
wife treasured that fact. It gave 
her a vicarious feeling of wickedness and compensated for a completely proper life." 

"Why should a law-abiding 
woman wish to feel wicked?" 

Baley almost smiled. "Because 



she is law-abiding. Anyway, I did 
a very foolish thing. In a moment 
of irritation, I insisted that the 
historic Jezebel was in reality a 
good wife. I've regretted explaining that ever since. It made Jessie 
bitterly unhappy. I had spoiled 
something for her that couldn't 
be replaced. I imagine she wished 
to punish me by engaging in 
activity she knew I wouldn't approve of. I would say the wish 
was not a conscious one." 

"Can a wish be anything but 
conscious? Is that not a contradiction in terms?" 

T> ALEY stared at R. Daneel 
and despaired at attempting 
to explain the unconscious mind. 
He said instead, "Besides that, 
the Bible has a great influence 
on human thought and emotion." 

"What is the Bible?" 

For a moment Baley was surprised, and then was surprised at 
himself for being surprised. The 
Spacers, he knew, lived under a 
thoroughly mechanistic personal 
philosophy. R. Daneel could 
know only what the Spacers 
knew and no more. 

He said curtly, "It is the sacred 
book of about half of Earth's 
population." 

"I db not grasp the meaning 
of the adjective." 

"I mean that it is highly regarded. Various portions of it, 
when properly interpreted, con


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



119 



tain a code, of behavior which 
many, men consider best suited to 
the ultimate happiness of mankind." 

R. Daneel seemed to consider 
that. "Is this code incorporated 
into your laws?" 

"I'm afraid not. The code 
doesn't lend itself to legal enforcement. It must be obeyed by 
each individual out of a desire 
to do so. It is, in a sense, higher 
than any law can be." 

"Higher than law? Nothing can 
be!" 

Baley smiled wryly. "Shall I 
quote a portion of the Bible for 
you?" 

"Please do." 

Baley let the car slow to a halt 
and for a few moments sat with 
his eyes closed, remembering. He 
would have liked to use the 
sonorous Middle English of the 
Medieval Bible — but, to R. 
Daneel, Middle English would 
be gibberish. 

He began, speaking almost casually, in the words of the Modern 
Revision, as though he were telling a story of contemporary life 
instead of dredging a tale out of 
Man's remote past. 

" 'Jesus went to the mount of 
Olives, and at dawn returned to 
the temple. All the people came 
to Him, and He sat down and 
preached to them. And the 
scribes and Pharisees brought to 
Him a woman caught in adultery, 



and when they had placed her 
before Him, they said to Him, 
"Master, this woman was caught 
in adultery, in the very act. Now 
Moses, in the law, commanded 
us to stone such offenders. What 
do you say?" 

" 'They said this, hoping to 
trap Him, that they might have 
grounds for accusations against 
Him. But Jesus stooped down, 
and with His finger wrote on the 
ground, as though He had not 
heard them. But when they continued asking Him, He stood up 
and said to them, "He that is 
without sin among you, let him 
first cast a stone at her." 

" 'And again He stooped down 
and wrote on the ground. And 
those that heard this, being convicted by their own conscience, 
went away one by one, beginning 
with the oldest, down to the last : 
and Jesus was left alone, with 
the woman standing before Him. 
When Jesus stood up and saw no 
one but, the woman, He said to 
her, "Woman, where are your 
accusers? Has no one condemned 
you?" 

" 'She said, "No one, Lord." 

" 'And Jesus said to her, "Nor 
do I condemn you. Go, and sin 
no more." ' " 

R DANEEL listened attentive• ly. He said, "What is adultery?" 

"That doesn't matter. It was a 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



crime for which the accepted punishment was stoning — that is, 
stones were thrown until the guilty one was killed." 

"And the woman was guilty?" 

"She was." 

"Then why was she not 
stoned ?" 

"None of the accusers felt he 
could after Jesus' statement. The 
story is meant to show that there 
is something even higher than 
the justice which you have been 
filled with. There is a human impulse known as mercy, a human 
act known as forgiveness." 

"I am not acquainted with 
those words, partner Elijah." 

"I know," muttered Baley. "I 
know." 

He started the squad-car with 
a jerk and let it tear forward 
savagely. He was pressed back 
against the cushions of the seat. 

"Where are we going?" asked 
R. Daneel. 

"To Yeast Town," said Baley, 
"to get the truth out of Francis 
Clousarr, conspirator." 

"You have a method for doing 
this, Elijah?" 

"Not I, exactly. But you have, 
Daneel — a simple one." 

They sped onward. 

CHAPTER XV 

"DALEY could feel the vague 
aroma of Yeast Town growing stronger. He did not find it 



as unpleasant as some did — Jes 
sie, for instance. Actually, he 
rather liked it. It had pleasant 
connotations. 

Every time he smelled raw 
yeast, the alchemy of sense-per 
ception carried him more than 
three decades into the past. He 
was a ten-year-old again, visiting 
his uncle Boris, who was a yeast 
farmer. Uncle Boris always had 
a little supply of yeast-delectables — small cookies, chocolaty 
things filled with sweet liquid, 
hard confections in the shape of 
cats and dogs. Young as he was, 
he knew that uncle Boris 
shouldn't really have had them to 
give away and he always ate 
them very quietly, sitting in a 
corner with his back to the center 
of the room. He would eat them 
quickly for fear of being caught. 

They tasted all the better for 
that. 

Poor uncle Boris! He had had 
an accident and died. They had 
never told him exactly how, and 
he had cried bitterly, because he 
thought" uncle Boris had been arrested for smuggling yeast out of 
the plant. He expected to be arrested and executed himself. 
Years later, he had poked carefully through police files and 
learned the truth. Uncle Boris 
had fallen beneath the treads of 
a transport. It was a disillusioning ending to a romantic myth. 

Yet the myth would always 



e 
t 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



121 



arise in his mind, at least momentarily, whenever his nostrils 
caught a whiff of raw yeast. 

Yeast Town was not the official 
name of any part of New York 
City. It could be found in no 
gazetteer and on no official map. 
What was called Yeast Town in 
popular speech was, to the Post 
Office, merely the boroughs of 
Newark, New Brunswick and 
Trenton. It was a broad strip 
across what had once been Medieval New Jersey, dotted with residential areas, particularly in 
Newark Center and Trenton Center, but given over mostly to the 
many-layered farms in which a 
thousand varieties of yeast grew 
and multiplied. 

One -fifth of the City's productive population worked in the 
yeast farms — another fifth worked in the subsidiary industries. 
Beginning with the mountains of 
wood and coarse cellulose that 
were dragged into the City from 
the tangled forests of the Alleghenies — through the vats of acid 
that hydrolized it to glucose — 
the carloads of niter and phosphate rock that were the most 
important additives— down, to the 
jars. of organics supplied by the 
chemical laboratories — it all came 
to only one thing : yeast and 
more yeast. 

Without yeast, six of Earth's 
eight billions would starve in a 
year. 



Baley felt cold at the thought. 
Three days before, the possibility had existed as deeply as it did 
now. But, three days before, it 
would never have occurred to 
him. 

fTTHEY whizzed out of the Motorway through an exit on 
the Newark outskirts. The thinly 
populated avenues, flanked on 
either side by the featureless 
blocks that were the farms, offered little to check their speed. 

"What time is it, Daneel?" 
asked Baley. 

"Sixteen- oh -five,'* replied R. 
Daneel. 

"Then he'll be at work, if he's 
on day-shift." 

Baley parked the squad-car in 
a delivery recess and froze the 
controls. 

"This is New York Yeast, Elijah?" asked the robot. 

"Part of it," said Baley. 

They entered a corridor flanked 
by a double row of offices. A receptionist at a bend in the corridor gave them an automatic 
smile. "Whom do you wish to 
see?" 

Baley opened his wallet. "Police. Is there a Francis Clousarr 
working for New York Yeast?" 

The girl looked perturbed. "I 
can check." 

She connected her switchboard 
through a line plainly marked 
Personnel and her lips moved 



\22 




 



slightly, though no sound could 
be heard, 

Baley was no stranger to the 
throat-phones that translated the 
sub-vocalization of the larynx into words. He said, "Speak up, 
please. Let me hear you." 

Her words became audible, but 
consisted only of, ". . . he says 
he's a policeman, sir." 

A dark, well-dressed man came 
out through a door. He had a 
thin mustache and his hairline 
was beginning to retreat. He 
smiled mirthlessly and said, "I'm 
Prescott of Personnel. What's the 
trouble, Officer ?" 

Baley stared at him coldly and 
Prescott's smile grew strained. He 
added, "I just don't want to upset 
the workers. They're touchy 
about the police." 

Baley said, "Tough, isn't it? 
Is Clousarr in the building now?" 

"Yes, Officer." 

"Let's have a rod then. If he's 
gone when we get there, I'll be 
speaking to you again." 

The other's smile was quite 
dead. He muttered, "I'll get you 
a rod, Officer." 

'PHE guide-rod was set for Department CG, Section 2. 
What that meant in factory 
terminology, Baley didn't know. 
He didn't have to. The rod was 
an inconspicuous thing which 
could be palmed in the hand. Its 
tip warmed gently when lined up 



in the direction for which it was 
set, cooled quickly when turned 
away. The warmth increased as 
the final goal was approached. 

To an amateur, the guide-rod 
was almost useless, with its quick 
little differences of heat content. 
But few City-dwellers were amateurs at this particular game. One 
of the most popular and perennial of the games of childhood 
was hide-and -seek through the 
school-level corridors with the 
use of toy guide-rods— "Hot or 
Not, let Hot-Spot Spot. Hot-Spot 
Guide-Rods Are Keen." 
. Baley had found his way 
through hundreds of massive piles 
by guide-rod, and he could follow the shortest course with one 
of them in his hand as though it 
had been mapped out for him. 

When he stepped into a large 
and brilliantly lit room after ten 
minutes, the guide-rod's tip was 
almost hot. 

Baley said to the worker nearest the door, "Francis Clousarr 
here?" 

The worker jerked his head. 
Baley walked in the indicated direction. The odor of yeast was 
sharp, despite the laboring airpumps whose humming made a 
steady background noise. 

A man had risen at the other 
end of the room and was taking 
off an apron. He was of moderate height, his face deeply lined, though he was comparatively 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



123 



youthful, and his hair just beginning to grizzle. He had large 
knobby hands, which he wiped 
slowly on a celltex towel. 

"I'm Francis Clousarr," he 
said. 

Baley looked briefly at R. Dane el. 

The robot nodded. 

"Okay," said Baley. "Anywhere we can talk?" 

"Maybe," said Clousarr slowly. "But its just about the end of 
my shift. How about tomorrow?" 

"Lots of hours between now 
and tomorrow. Let's make it 
now." Baley opened his wallet 
and displayed it to the yeast 
farmer. 

But Clousarr' s hands did not 
waver in their somber wiping 
motions. He said coolly, "I don't 
know the system in the Police 
Department, but around here you 
get tight eating hours with no 
leeway. I eat at 1700 to 1745 or 
I don't eat." 

"It's all right," said Baley. "I'll 
arrange to have your supper 
brought to you." 

"Well, well," said Clousarr 
joylessly. "Just like an aristocrat or a C-class copper. What's 
next — private bath?" 

"You just answer questions, 
Clousarr," said Baley, "and save 
your big jokes for your girlfriend. Where can we talk?" 

"If you want to talk, how 
about the balance room? Suit 



yourself about that. Me, I've got 
nothing to say — nothing at all." 

"DALEY thumbed Clousarr into the balance room. It was 
square and antiseptic ally white, 
air-conditioned independently of 
the" larger room — and more efficiently. Its walls were lined with 
delicate electronic balances, glassed off and manipulated by fieldforces only. Baley had used 
cheaper models in his college 
days. One make, which he recognized, weighed a mere billion 
atoms. 

Clousarr said, "I don't think 
anyone will come in here." 

Baley grunted, then turned to 
Daneel and said, "Would you 
step out and have a meal sent up 
here? And, if you don't mind, 
wait outside for it." 

He watched R. Daneel leave, 
then said to Clousarr, "You're a 
chemist?" 

"I'm a zymologist, if you don't 
mind." 

"What's the difference?" 

Clousarr looked lofty. "A 
chemist is a soup-pusher, a stinkoperator. A zymologist is a man 
who helps keep a few .billion people alive. I'm a yeast-culture specialist." 

"All right," said Baley. "Continue talking." 

But Clousarr was not to be diverted. "This laboratory keeps 
New York Yeast going. There 



124 




 



isn't a day, not one hour, that we 
haven't got cultures of every 
strain of yeast in the Company 
growing in our kettles. We check 
and adjust the food-factor requirements. We make sure it's 
breeding true. We twist the genetics, start the new strains and 
weed them out, sort their properties and mold them again. 

"When New Yorkers started 
getting strawberries out of season 
a couple of years back, those 
weren't strawberries, fella. Those 
were a special high-sugar yeast 
culture with a true-bred color 
and just a dash of flavor additive. It was developed right here 
in this room. 

"Twenty years ago, Saccharomyces olei Benedictae was just 
a scrub strain with a lousy taste 
of tallow and good for nothing. 
It still tastes of tallow, but its 
fat content has been pushed up 
from fifteen per cent to eightyseven. 1 If you used the Expressway today, just remember that 
it's greased strictly with S. O. 
Benedictae, Strain AG-7 '. Developed right here in this room. 

"So don't call me chemist. I'm 
a zymologist." 

Despite himself, Baley was impressed by the fierce pride of the 
other. 

He said abruptly, "Where were 
you last night between the hours 
of 18 and 20?" 

Clousarr shrugged. "Walking. 



I like to take a little walk after 
dinner." 

"You visited friends? Or a 
sub-etheric?" 

"No. Just walked." 

T IJE Baley's lips tightened. A 
*~* visit to the sub-etherics would 
have involved a notch in Clousarr* s ration plack. A meeting 
with a friend would have involved naming a man or woman and 
offered a cross-check. 

"No one saw you then?" 

"Maybe someone did. I don't 
know. Not that I know of, 
though." 

"What about the night before 
last?" 

"Same thing." 

"You have no alibi then for 
either night?" 

"If I had done anything criminal, I'd have one. What do I 
need an alibi for?" 

Baley didn't answer. He consulted his little book. "You were 
up before the magistrate once. 
Inciting to riot." 

"All right. One of the R-things 
pushed past me and I tripped 
him up. Is that inciting to riot?" 

"The court thought so. You 
were convicted and fined." 

"That ends it, doesn't it? Or 
do you want to fine me again?" 

"Night before last, there was a 
near-riot at a shoe department 
in the Bronx. You were seen 
there." 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



"By whom?" 

Baley said, "It was at mealtime for you here. Did you eat 
the evening meal night before 
last?" 

Clousarr hesitated, then shook 
his head- "Upset stomach. Yeast 
gets you that way sometimes. 
Even an old-timer like me." 

"Last night, there was a nearriot in Williamsburg and you 
were seen there." 

"By whom?" 

"Do you deny you were present on both occasions?" 

"You're not giving me anything to deny. Where did these 
things happen and who says he 
saw me?" 

Baley stared at the zymologist 
Ievelly. "I think you know exactly what I'm talking about. I 
think you're an important man 
in an unregistered Medievalist 
organization." 

"I can't stop you from thinking. Officer, but thinking isn't 
evidence. Maybe you know that." 
Clousarr was grinning. 

"Maybe," said Baley, his long 
face stony, "I can get a little 
truth out of you right now." 

Baley stepped to the door of 
the balance room and opened it. 
•He said to R. Daneel, who was 
waiting stolidly outside, "Has 
Clousarr's evening meal arrived?" 

"It is coming now, Elijah." 
"Bring it in, will you, Daneel?" 



"TVANEEL entered a moment 
'-'later with a compartmented 
metal tray. 

"Put it in front of Mr. Clousarr, Daneel," said Baley. He sat 
down on one of the stools that 
lined the balance wall with his 
legs crossed and one shoe swinging rhythmically. He watched 
Clousarr edge stiffly away as R. 
Daneel placed the tray on a stool 
near the zymologist. 

"Francis Clousarr," said Baley, 
"I want to introduce you to my 
partner, Daneel Olivaw." 

Daneel put out his hand and 
said, "How do you do, Francis." 

Clousarr said nothing. He made 
no move to grasp Daneel's extended hand. Daneel maintained 
his position and Clousarr began 
to redden. 

Baley said softly, "You are being rude, Mr. Clousarr. Are you 
too proud to shake hands with 
a policeman?" 

Clousarr muttered, "If you 
don't mind, I'm hungry." He unfolded a pocket-fork out of a 
clasp-knife he took from his 
pocket and sat down, his eyes on 
his meal. 

Baley said, "Daneel, I think 
our friend is offended by your 
official attitude. You are not angry with him, are you?" 

"Not at all, Elijah," said R. 
Daneel. 

"Then show that there are no 
hard feelings. Put your arm 



126 




 




about his shoulder." 

"I will be glad to," said R. Daneel. He stepped forward. 

Clousarr put down his fork. 
"What is this? What's going on?" 

R. Daneel. unruffled, put out 
his arm. 

Clousarr swung back-handed 
wildly, knocking R. Daneel's arm 
to one side. "Damn it, don't 
touch me!" 

He jumped up and away, the 
tray of food tipping and hitting 
the floor in a messy clatter. 

Baley, hard-eyed, nodded curtly to R. Daneel, who continued 



a stolid advance toward the retreating zymologist. Baley stepped in front of the door. 

Clousarr yelled, "Keep that 
thing away from me!" 

"That's no way to speak." said 
Baley with equanimity. "The 
man's my partner." 

"You mean he's a damned robot!" 

"All right, let him alone. Daneel," said Baley promptly. 

R. Daneel stepped back and 
stood quietly against the door 
just behind Baley. Clousarr, 
panting harshly, his fists clench


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



127 



ed, his face White, faced Baley. 

Baley said, "All right, smart 
boy. What makes you think Daneel's a robot?" 

"Anyone can tell!" 

"We'll leave that to a judge. 
Meanwhile, we want "you at headquarters, Clousarr. We'd like to 
have you explain exactly how you 
knew Daneel was a robot. And 
lots more, mister, lots more. Daneel, step outside and get through 
to the Commissioner. He'll be at 
his home by now. Ask him to 
come down to the office. Tell him 
I have a fellow who can't wait to 
be questioned." 

R. Daneel stepped out of the 
room. 

T) ALEY said, "What makes 
your wheels go round, Clousarr?" 

"I want a lawyer." 

"You'll get one. Meanwhile, 
suppose you tell me what makes 
you Medievalists tick." 

Clousarr looked away in a determined silence. 

Baley said, "We know all about 
you and your organization. I'm 
not bluffing. Just tell me for 
my own curiosity — what do you 
Medievalists warir?" 
' "Back to the soil," said Clousarr in a stifled voice. "That's 
simple, isn't it?" 

"It's simple to say, but isn't 
simple to do. How's the soil going to feed eight billions?" 



"Did I say back to the soil overnight? Or in a year? Or in a 
hundred years? Step by step. It 
doesn't matter how long it takes, 
but let's get started out of these 
caves we live in. Let's get out into the fresh air." 

"Have you ever been out in 
the fresh air?" 

Clousarr squirmed. "All right, 
so I'm ruined, too. But the children aren't ruined yet. Get them 
out, for God's sake. Let them 
have space and open air and sun. 
If we've got to, we can cut our 
population little by little." 

"Backward to an impossible 
past." Baley did not really know 
why he was arguing, except for 
the strange fever that was burning in his own veins. "Back to the 
seed, to the egg, to the womb. 
Why not move forward instead? 
Don't cut Earth's population. Use 
it for export. Go back to the soil, 
but go back to the soil of other 
planets. Colonize !" 

Clousarr laughed harshly. 
"And make more Outer Worlds? 
More Spacers?" 

"We won't. The Outer Worlds 
were settled by Earthmen who 
came from a planet that did not 
have Cities — by Earthmen who 
were individualists and materialists. Those qualities were carried to an unhealthy extreme. We 
can now colonize out of a society 
that has carried cooperation, if 
anything, too far. Now environ


126 




 



merit and tradition can interact 
to form a new middle way, distinct from either old Earth or 
the Outer Worlds. Something 
newer and better." 

He was parroting Dr. Fastolfe, 
he knew, but it was coming out 
as though he himself had been 
thinking of it for years. 

Clousarr said, "Yeast ! Colonize desert worlds instead of developing our own? What fools 
would try?" 

"Many — and they wouldn't be 
fools. There'd be robots to help." 

"No," said Clousarr fiercely. 
"Never! No robots!" 

"Why not, for God's sake? 
What are we afraid of in robots? 
If you want my guess, we all feel 
inferior to the Spacers and hate 
it. We've got to feel superior 
somehow, somewhere, to make up 
for it. It kills us that we can't at 
least feel superior to robots. They 
seem to be better than us — only 
they're nor. That's the irony of 
it." 

J IJE Baley felt his blood heating as he spoke. "Look at 
Daneel. I've been with him for 
over two days. He's taller than 
I am, stronger, handsomer. He 
looks like a Spacer, in fact. He's 
got a better memory and knows 
more facts. He doesn't have to 
sleep or eat. He's not troubled by 
sickness or panic or love or guilt. 
"But he's a machine. I can do 



anything I want to him, the way 
I can to that micro-balance right 
there. If I slam the micro-balance, it wcyi't hit me back. Neither will Daneel. I can order him 
to use a blaster on himself and 
he'll do it. 

"We can't ever build a robot 
that will be as good as a human 
being in anything that counts. 
We can't create a robot with a 
sense of beauty or a sense of ethics or a sense of religion. There's 
no way we can raise a positronic 
brain one inch above the level 
of absolute materialism. 

"We can't, damn it — not as 
long as we don't understand what 
makes our own brains tick. Not 
as long as things exist that science can't measure. What is 
beauty, or goodness, or art, or 
love, or God? We're forever teetering on the brink of the unknowable, trying to understand what 
can't be understood. It's what 
makes us men. 

"A robot's brain must be finite 
or it can't be built. It must 
be calculated to the final decimal 
place, so that it has an end. Jehoshaphat, what are you afraid 
of? A robot can look like Daneel, 
he can look like a god, and yet 
be no more human than a blob 
of yeast. Can't you see that?" 

Clousarr had tried to interrupt several times and failed 
against Baley's furious torrent. 
Now, when Baley paused in sheer 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



729 



emotional exhaustion, he said 
weakly, "Copper turned philosopher. Well, what do you know?" 




DANEEL re-entered. Baley looked .at him and 



frowned, partly with the anger 
that had not yet left him, partly 
with new annoyance. 

"What kept you?" he demanded. 

R. Daneel said, "I had trouble 
reaching Commissioner Enderby, 
Elijah. It turned out that he was 
still at his office." 

Baley looked at his watch. 
"Now? What for?" 

"There is a certain confusion 
at the moment. A corpse has 
been discovered in the Department." 

"What! For God's sake, who?" 

"The errand boy — R. Sammy." 

Baley gulped. He stared at the 
robot and stated in an outraged 
voice, "I thought you said a 
corpse." 

R. Daneel amended smoothly, 
"A robot with a completely deactivated brain, if you prefer." 

Clousarr laughed suddenly and 
Baley turned on him, saying 
savagely, "Nothing out of you!> 
Understand?" Deliberately, he 
unlimbered his blaster. Clousarr 
fell silent. 

Baley said. "Well, what of it? 
R. Sammy blew a fuse. So what?" 

"Commissioner Enderby was 
evasive. Elijah, but while he did 



not say so outright, my impression is that he believes R. Sammy was deliberately deactivated." 

Then, as Baley absorbed that 
silently, R. Daneel added" gravely, "Or if you prefer the phrase — 
murdered." 

CHAPTER XVI 

T>ALEY replaced his blaster, 
but kept his hand unobtrusively upon its butt. He said, 
"Walk ahead of us, Clousarr, to 
17th Street Exit B." 

Clousarr said, "I haven't eaten." 

"There's your meal on the floor, 
where you dumped it." 

"I have a right to eat." 

1 'You'll eat in Detention or 
you'll miss a meal. You won't 
starve. Get going." 

All three were silent as they 
threaded the maze of New York 
Yeast — Clousarr moving stonily 
in advance, Baley right behind 
him, R. Daneel in the rear. 

It was after Baley and R. Daneel had checked out at the receptionist's desk, after Clousarr 
had drawn a leave of absence, after they were out in the open 
alongside the parked squad-car, 
that Clousarr said, "Just a minute." 

He hung back, turned toward 
R. Daneel and, before Baley 
could make a move to stop him, 
stepped forward and swung his 



130 




 



open hand full against the robot's 
cheek. 

"What the devil!" cried Baley, 
grabbing violently at Clousarr. 

Clousarr did not resist the 
plainclothesman's grasp. "It's all 
right. I'll go along with you. I 
just wanted to see for myself." 
He was grinning. 

R. Daneel, having rolled with 
the slap, but not having escaped 
it entirely, gazed quietly at Clousarr. There was no reddening of 
his cheek, no mark of any blow, 
at all. 

He said, "That was a dangerous 
action, Francis. Had I not moved 
backward, you might easily have 
damaged your hand. As it is, I 
regret that I must have caused 
you pain." 

Clousarr laughed. 

Baley said, "Get in, Clousarr. 
You too, Daneel — right in the 
back seat with him. And make 
sure he doesn't move. I don't care 
if it means breaking his arm. 
That's an order." 

"What about the First Law?" 
mocked Clousarr. 

"I think Daneel is strong 
enough and fast enough to stop 
you without hurting you. But it 
might do you good to have an 
arm or two broken, at that." 

Baley got behind the wheel and 
the squad-car gathered speed. 
The empty wind ruffled his hair 
and Clousarr's, but R. Daneel's 
remained smoothly in place. 



R DANEEL said quietly to 
• Clousarr, "Do you fear 
robots for the sake of your job, 
Mr. Clousarr?" 

Baley could not turn to see 
Clousarr's expression, but he was 
certain it would be hard and rigid with detestation. 

Clousarr's voice replied, "And 
my kids* jobs. And everyone's 
kids." 

"Surely adjustments are possible," said the robot. "If your 
children, for instance, were to accept training for emigration — " 

Clousarr broke in. "You, too? 
The policeman talked about emigration. He's got good robot 
training. Maybe he is a robot." 

Baley growled, "That's enough, 
you!" 

R. Daneel said evenly, "A 
training school for emigrants 
would bring about security, guaranteed classification, an assured 
career. If you are concerned over 
your children, that is something 
to consider." 

"I wouldn't take anything from 
a robot, or a Spacer, or any of 
the trained hyenas in the Government." 

That was all. The silence of 
the Motorway engulfed them and 
there was only the soft whirr of 
the squad-car motor and the hiss 
of its wheels on the pavement until they reached the Department. 

Baley signed a detention certificate for Clousarr and left him 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



131 



in appropriate hands. Following 
that, he and R. Daneel took the 
Motospiral up the levels to 
Headquarters. 

R. Daneel showed no surprise 
that they had not taken the elevators, nor did Baley expect him 
to. He was becoming used to the 
robot's queer mixture of initiative and compliance and tended 
to leave him out of his calculations. The elevator was the logical method of leaping the vertical 
gap between Detention and Headquarters. The long moving stairway that was the Motospiral was 
useful only for short climbs or 
drops of two or three levels at 
most. People of all sorts and varieties of administrative occupation stepped on and then off in 
less than a minute. Only Baley 
and R. Daneel remained on continuously, moving upward in a 
slow and stolid measure. 

Baley felt he needed the time. 
It was only minutes at best, but 
up in Headquarters he would be 
thrown violently against another 
phase of the problem and he 
wanted a rest. He wanted time to 
think, to orient himself. Slowly 
as it moved, the Motospiral went 
too quickly to satisfy him. 

|~|ANEEL said, "It seems then 
we will not be questioning 
Clousarr just yet." 

"He'll keep," said Baley irritably. 



"It is a pity. His cerebric qualities — " 

"What about them?" 

"They have changed in a 
strange way. What took place 
between the two of you in the 
balance room while I was not 
present?" 

Baley said absently, "I passed 
along the Gospel according to St. 
Fastolfe." 

"I do not understand you, 
Elijah." 

Baley sighed. "I preached emigration, just as he told you in 
the squad-car." 

"I see. And what did you tell 
him about robots?" 

"You really want to know? I 
told him robots were simply machines. That was the Gospel according to St. Gerrigel. There are 
any number of gospels, I think-" 

"Did you by any chance tell 
him that one could strike a robot 
without fear of a return blow, 
much as one could strike any 
other mechanical object?" 

"Except a punching bag. I suppose. Yes — but what made you 
guess that?" Baley looked curiously at the robot. 

"It fits the cerebric changes," 
said R. Daneel, "and it explains 
his blow to my face just after we 
left the factory. He must have 
been thinking of what you said, 
so he simultaneously tested your 
statement, worked off his aggressive feelings and had the pleasure 



132 




 



of seeing me placed in. what 
seemed to him a position of inferiority. In order to be so motivated and allowing for the delta 
variations in his quintic . . ." 

He paused a long moment. 
"Yes, it is quite interesting. I 
believe I can form a self-consistent whole of the data." 

Headquarters level was approaching. Baley said, "What 
time is it?" 

He thought pettishly: Yeast! 
I could look at my watch. It's 
faster. 

But he knew why he asked. 
His motive was not so different 
from Clousarr's in punching R. 
Daneel. By giving the robot a 
trivial order that he must fulfill, 
he emphasized R. Daneel's mechanical nature and,' contrariwise, his own humanity. 

Baley thought: We're all 
brothers. Under the skin, over it, 
everywhere. Jeshoshaphat! 

R. Daneel said, "Twenty-ten." 

They stepped off the Motospiral and, for a few seconds, 
Baley had the usual queer sensation that went with adjustment 
to non-motion. 

He said, "And I haven't eaten. 
Damn this job, anyway." 

T?LIJAH saw and heard Commissioner Enderby through 
the open door of his office. The 
Common Room was empty and 
Enderby's voice rang through it. 



His round face looked bare and 
weak without its glasses, which 
he held in his hand while he 
mopped his smooth forehead 
with a paper tissue. 

His eyes caught Baley just as 
the latter reached the door, his 
voice rose in a petulant tenor. 
"Good God, Baley, where the 
devil were you?" 

Baley shrugged off the complaint and said, "What's doing? 
Where's the night-shift?" And 
then he caught sight of the second person in the office with the 
Commissioner. He added blankly, "Dr. Gerrigel!" 

The gray-haired roboticist returned the involuntary greeting 
by nodding briefly. "Glad to see 
you again, Mr. Baley." 

The Commissioner readjusted 
his glasses and stared at Baley 
through them. "The entire staff 
is being questioned downstairs. 
Signing statements. I was going 
mad trying to find you. It looked queer, your being away." 

"My being away!" 

"Anybody's being away. Someone in the Department did it 
and there's going to be hell to 
pay. What an unholy mess! What 
an unholy rotten mess!" 

He raised his hands as though 
in expostulation to heaven and, 
as he did so, his eyes fell on R. 
Daneel. 

Baley thought sardonically : 
First time you've looked Daneel 



THE CAVES Of STEEL 



133 



in the face. Take a good look, 
Julius ! 

The Commissioner said in a 
subdued voice, "He'll have to 
sign a statement. Even I've had 
to do it. Me!" 

Baley said, "Look, " Commissioner, what makes you so sure 
that R. Sammy didn't blow a 
gasket all by himself? How do 
you know it was deliberate destruction?" 

The Commissioner sat down 
heavily. "Ask him," he said and 
pointed to Dr. Gerrigel. 

Dr. Gerrigel cleared his throat. 
"I scarcely know how to go about 
this, Mr. Baley. I take it from 
your expression that you are surprised to see me." 

"Moderately," admitted Baley. 

"Well, I was in no real hurry 
to return to Washington, and my 
visits to New York are few 
enough to make me wish to linger. More important, I felt it 
would be criminal for me to 
leave the City without at least 
one more effort to be allowed to 
analyze your fascinating robot, 
whom, by the way — " he looked 
very eager — "I see you have 
with you." 

"Impossible. He's Spacer property." 

The roboticist looked disappointed. "Perhaps you might ask 
them for permission." 

Baley's long face remained 
woodenly unresponsive. 



TAR. GERRIGEL went on. "t 
called you, but you weren't 
in. No one knew where you could 
be located. I asked for the Commissioner and he asked me to 
come to headquarters and wait 
for you." 

The Commissioner interposed 
quickly, "I thought it might be 
important. I knew you wanted 
to see the man." 

Baley nodded. "Thanks." 

Dr. Gerrigel said, "Unfortunately, my guide-rod was somewhat off, or, perhaps in my 
over-anxiety, I misjudged its 
temperature. In either case, I 
took a wrong turning and found 
myself in a small room — " 

The Commissioner interrupted 
again. "One of the photographic 
supply rooms, Lije." 

"Yes," said Dr. Gerrigel. "And 
in it was the prone figure of 
what was obviously a robot. It 
was quite clear to me after a 
brief examination that he was 
irreversibly deactivated. Dead, 
you might say. Nor was it very 
difficult to determine the cause 
of the deactivation." 

"What was it?" asked Baley. 

"In the robot's partly clenched 
right fist," said Dr. Gerrigel, "was 
a shiny ovoid about two inches 
long and half an inch wide, with 
a mica window at one end. The 
fist was in contact with his skull 
as though the robot's last act 
had been to touch his head. The 



134 




 



thing he was holding was an 
alpha -sprayer. You know what 
they are, I suppose?" 

Baley nodded. He had handled 
several in his lab courses in 
physics. An alpha -sprayer was 
a lead-alloy casing with a narrow pit dug into it longitudinally, 
at the bottom of which was a 
fragment of a plutonium salt. 
The pit was capped with a sliver 
of mica, which was transparent 
to alpha particles. In that one 
direction, hard radiation sprayed 
out. 

An alpha-sprayer had many 
uses, but killing robots was not 
one of them— not a legal one, at 
least. 

Baley said, "He held it to his 
head mica-first?" 



"Yes, and his positronic brainpaths were immediately randomized. Instant death, so to 
speak." 

Baley turned to the pale Commissioner. "No mistake? It really 
was an alpha -sprayer?" 

The Commissioner nodded, his 
lips pursed. "Absolutely. The 
counters could spot it ten feet 
away. Photographic film in the 
storeroom was fogged. Open and 
shut." 

He seemed to brood about it 
a moment or two, then said 
abruptly, "Dr. Gerrigel, I'm 
afraid you'll have to stay in the 
City until we get your evidence 
down on wire-film. I'll have you 
escorted to a room. You won't 
mind being under guard, I hope?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



135 



Dr. Gerrigel asked nervously, 
"Do you think it's necessary?" 
"It's safer." 

Dr. Gerrigel, seemingly quite 
abstracted, shook hands all 
around, even with R. Daneel. He 
left. 

The Commissioner heaved a 
sigh. "It's one of us, Lije. That's 
what bothers me. No outsider 
would come into the Department 
just to knock off a robot. Plenty 
of them outside where it's safer. 
And it had to be somebody who 
could pick up an alpha- sprayer. 
They're hard to get hold of." 

R DANEEL spoke, his cool, 
• even voice in contrast with 
the agitated tone of the Commissioner. He said, "But what is the 
motive for this murder?" 

The Commissioner glanced at 
R. Daneel with obvious distaste, 
then looked away. "We're human, too, unfortunately. I suppose policemen can't get to like 
robots any more than anyone 
else can. He's gone now, and 
maybe it's a relief to somebody. 
He used to annoy you considerably, Lije, remember." 

"That is scarcely a murder 
motive," said R. Daneel. 

"No," agreed Baley with decision. 

"It isn't murder," said the 
Commissioner. "It's property 
damage. Let's keep our legal 
terms straight. It's just that it 



was done inside the Department. 
Anywhere else, it would be nothing. Here it could be a first-class 
scandal. Lije!" 
"Yes?" 

"When did you last see R. 
Sammy?" 

Baley said, "R. Daneel spoke 
to R. Sammy after lunch. 1 
should judge it was about 13:30. 
He arranged to have us use your 
office, Commissioner." 

"My office? What for?" 

"I wanted to talk over the case 
with R. Daneel in moderate privacy. You weren't in, so your 
office was an obvious choice." 

"I see," the Commissioner 
looked dubious, but let the matter ride. "You didn't see him 
yourself?" 

"No, but I heard his voice, 
perhaps an hour afterward." 

"That would be about 14:30?" 

"Or a little sooner." 

The Commissioner bit his lower lip thoughtfully-. "Well, that 
settles one thing. The boy — Vincent Barrett — was here today." 

"I know. But he wouldn't do 
this." 

'T^HE Commissioner lifted his 
eyes to Baley's face. "Why 
not? R. Sammy took his job 
away. I can understand how he 
feels. There would be a tremendous sense of injustice. He'd want 
revenge. Wouldn't you? But the 
fact is that he left the building 



136 




 



at 14:00 and you heard R. Sammy alive at 14:30. Of course, he 
might have given the alphasprayer to R. Sammy before he 
left, with instructions not to use 
it for an hour. But where could 
he have gotten an alpha-sprayer? 
No, it doesn't hold up. Let's get 
back to R. Sammy. When you 
spoke to him at 14:30, what did 
he say?" 

Baley hesitated a perceptible 
moment, then replied carefully, 
"I don't remember. We left shortly afterward." 

"Where did you go?" 

"Yeast Town, eventually." 

The Commissioner rubbed his 
chin. "Jessie was in today. We 
checked on all visitors, of course. 
Why did she come here?" 

"Family matters." 

"I'm afraid she'll have to be 
questioned." 

"I understand police routine, 
Commissioner. Incidentally, what 
about the alpha-spray itself? Has 
it been traced?" 

"Oh, yes. It came from one of 
the power plants." 

"How do they account for having lost it?" 

"They don't. They have no 
idea. But look, Lije, except for 
routine statements, this has nothing to do with you. You stick to 
your case. It's just that . . . Well, 
you stick to the Spacetown investigation." 

Baley said, "May I give my 



routine statements later, Commissioner? I haven't eaten yet." 

Commissioner Enderby blinked. "By all means, get something 
to eat. But stay inside the Department, will you? Your partner's right, though, Lije — " he 
seemed to avoid addressing R. 
Daneel or using his name — "It's 
the motive we need." 

Baley felt suddenly frozen. 
Something outside himself, something completely alien, took up 
the events of this day and the 
day before and the day before 
that and juggled them. A pattern 
began to form. 

He said, "Which power plant 
did the alpha-sprayer come 
from, Commissioner?" 

"The Williamsburg plant. 
Why?" 

"Nothing — noth ing." 

The last word Baley heard the 
Commissioner mutter as he 
strode out of the office, with R. 
Daneel immediately behind him, 
was, "Motive. Motive." 

¥>ALEY ate a sparse meal in 
the small and infrequently 
used Department lunch room. He 
devoured a stuffed tomato on 
lettuce without noticing what he 
was eating. For a second or so, 
after he had gulped down the 
last mouthful, his fork still 
slithered aimlessly over the slick 
disposable plate, searching automatically for something that was 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



137 



no longer there. 

He became aware of it and put 
down his fork with a muffled, 
"Jehoshaphat!" He said, "Daneel!" 

R. Daneel had been sitting at 
another table, as though he wished to leave the obviously preoccupied Baley in peace, or as 
though he required privacy himself. Baley was past caring which. 

Daneel stood up, moved to 
Baley's table and sat down again. 
"Yes, partner Elijah?" 

Baley did not look at him. 
"Daneel, they'll question Jessie 
and myself. Let me answer the 
questions in my own way, understand ?" 

"What if I am asked a direct 
question? It is not possible for 
me to saying anything but what 
is so." 

"I f you are asked a direct 
question, very well. Just don't 
volunteer information. You can 
do that, can't you?" 

"I believe so, Elijah, provided 
it does not mean that I am hurting a human being by remaining 
silent." 

Baley said grimly, "You'll hurt 
me if you don't. I assure you of 
that." 

* "I do not quite comprehend 
your point of view, partner Elijah. Surely the matter of R. 
Sammy cannot concern you." 

"No? It all centers about 
motive, doesn't? You've ques


tioned the motive. The Commissioner questioned it. I question 
it myself, for that matter. Why 
should anyone want to kill R. 
Sanimy? Mind you, it's not just 
a question of who would want to 
smash up robots in general. 
Practically any Earthman would 
want to do that. 

"The question is, who would 
want to single out R. Sammy? 
Vincent Barrett might, but the 
Commissioner said he couldn't 
get hold of an alpha -sprayer, 
and he's right. We have to look 
somewhere else and it so happens 
that one other person has a motive. It glares out. It yells. It 
stinks to top level." 

"Who is the person, Elijah?" 

Baley said softly, "I am, 
Daneel." 

RDANEEL'S expressionless 
• face did not change under 
the impact of the statement. He 
merely shook his head. 

Baley said, "You don't agree? 
My wife came to the office today. They know that already. 
Even the Commissioner is curious. If I weren't a personal friend, 
he wouldn't have stopped his 
questioning so soon. Now they'll 
find out why. That's certain. She 
was part of a conspiracy — a foolish and harmless one, but a conspiracy just the same. And a 
policeman can't afford to have 
his wife mixed up with anything 



138 




 



like that. It would be to my obvious interest to see that the matter was hushed up. 

"Well, who knew about it?" 
he added. "You and I, of course, 
and Jessie — -and R. Sammy. He 
saw her in a state of panic. When 
he told her that we had left orders not to be disturbed, she 
must have lost control. You saw 
how she was when she came in." 

R, Daneel said, "It is unlikely 
that she said anything incriminating to him." 

"That may be so. But I'm reconstructing the case the way 
they will. They'll say she did. 
There's my motive, I killed him 
to keep him quiet." 

"They will not think so." 

"They will think so. The murder was arranged deliberately in 
order to throw suspicion on me. 
Why use an alpha-sprayer? It's 
a rather risky weapon. It's hard 
to get and it can be traced. I believe those were the very reasons 
it was used. The murderer even 
ordered R. Sammy to go into the 
photographic supply room and 
kill himself there. It seems obvious to me that the reason for that 
was to have the method of murder unmistakable. Even if everyone was infantile enough not to 
recognize the alpha-sprayer immediately, someone would be 
bound to notice fogged photographic film in fairly short 
order." 

THE CAVES OF STEEl 



"How does all this relate to 
you, Elijah?" 

Baley grinned nervously, his 
long face completely devoid of 
humor. "Very neatly. The alphasprayer was taken from the Williamsburg power plant. You and 
I passed through the Williamsburg power plant yesterday. We 
were seen and that fact will come 
out. That gives me opportunity 
to get the weapon as well as motive for the crime. And it may 
turn out that we were the last 
ones to see or hear R. Sammy 
alive — except for the real murderer, of course." 

"I was with you in the power 
plant. I can testify that you did 
not have the opportunity to steal 
an alpha-sprayer." 

"Thanks," said Baley sadly, 
"but you're a robot. Your testimony will be invalid." 

"The Commissioner is your 
friend. He will listen. He will 
have to listen." 

"The Commissioner has a job 
to keep, and he's already a bit 
uneasy about me. There's only 
one chance of saving myself from 
this very nasty situation." 

"Yes?" 

"T ASK myself, why am I being framed? Obviously, to 
get rid of me. But why? Again, 
obviously, because I am dangerous to someone. I am doing my 
best to be dangerous to whoever 

139 



killed Dr. Sarton in Spacetown. 
That might mean the Medievalists, of course, or at least the 
inner group among them. It 
would be this inner group that 
would know I passed through 
the power plant. One or more of 
them might have followed us 
along the strips that far, even 
though you thought we had lost 
them. 

"So the chances are that, if I 
find the murderer of Dr. Sarton, 
I find the man or men trying to 
get me out of the way. If I 
think it through — if I crack the 
case — I'll be safe. And Jessie. I 
couldn't stand to have her . . . 
But I don't have much time." 

Baley looked at R. Daneel 
with sudden burning hope. Whatever the creature was, he was 
strong and faithful, inspired by 
no selfishness. What more could 
you ask of any friend? Baley 
needed a friend, and he was in 
no mood to cavil at the fact that 
a gear replaced a blood-vessel 
in this particular one. 

"You and I," he said. "You 
and I, Daneel. We'll get it out of 
Clousarr. You can use your cerebroanalysis, squeeze the most out 
of it, make it . . ." 

He stopped in astonishment. 
R. Daneel was shaking his head. 

The robot said, "I am sorry, 
Elijah — " there was no trace of 
sorrow on his face, of course — 
"but I anticipated none of this. 



Perhaps my action was to your 
harm. I am sorry if the general 
good requires that." 

"What general good?" stammered Baley. 

"I have been in communication 
with Dr. Fastolfe." 

"Jehoshaphat! When?" 

"While you were eating. I possess the capacity for sub-etheric 
communication with Spacetown. 
It was thought wise to install a 
self-contained circuit for the purpose within me. I've used it before." 

Baley's Hps tightened. Was he 
never to finish learning of new 
potentialities within the lump of 
metal and plastic that faced him 
now? 

"Well?" he managed to say. 
"What happened?" 

"You will have to clear yourself of suspicion of the murder of 
R. Sammy through some means 
other than the investigation of 
the murder of my designer, Dr. 
Sarton. Our people at Spacetown, 
as a result of my information, 
have decided to bring that investigation to an end, as of today, 
and to begin plans for leaving 
Spacetown and Earth." 

CHAPTER XVII 

TJALEY looked at his watch 
with something close to detachment. It was 21:45. In two 
and a quarter hours, it would be 



MO 




 



midnight. He had been awake 
since before six and had been 
under tension now for more than 
two days. 

"What's it all about, Daneel?" 
he asked. 

R. Daneel said, "Is it not obvious?" 

"It is not a damn bit obvious." 

"We are here," said the robot, 
"to break down the isolationism 
of Earth and force its people into 
new expansion and colonization." 

"I know that." 

"If we were anxious to exact 
punishment for the murder of 
Dr. Sarton, it was not that in doing so we expected to bring Dr. 
Sarton back to life. It was only 
that failure to do so would 
strengthen the position of our 
home-planet politicians, who are 
against the very idea of Spacetown." 

"But now," said Baley, with 
sudden violence, "you say you're 
getting ready to go home of your 
own accord. Why? The answer to 
the Sarton case is close. It must 
be close or they wouldn't be trying so hard to blast me out of 
the investigation. I have a feeling I have all the facts I need to 
work out the answer." 

Baley drew a shuddering 
breath. He was making a spectacle of himself before a machine 
that could only stare at him silently. 

He said harshly, "Well, never 



mind that. Why are the Spacers 
breaking off?" 

"Our project is concluded. We 
are satisfied that Earth will colonize." 

"You've switched to optimism?" 

"For a long time now, we of 
Spacetown have tried to change 
Earth by changing its economy. 
We have tried to introduce our 
own C/Fe culture — the carbon 
and iron of a human-plus-robot 
society. Your planetary and various City government cooperated 
with us because it was expedient 
to do so. Still, for twenty-five 
years, we had consistently failed. 
The harder we tried, the stronger i 
the opposing party of the Medievalists grew." 

"I know all this," said Baley. 
"Get to the point." 

F> DANEEL went on, "It was 
Dr. Sarton who argued that 
we must reverse our tactics. We 
must first find a segment of 
Earth's population that desired 
what we desired or could be persuaded to do so. By encouraging 
and helping them, we could make 
the movement a native rather 
than an alien one. The difficulty 
was in finding the native element 
best suited for our purposes. You 
yourself, Elijah, were an interesting experiment." 

"I? What do you mean?" demanded Baley. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



141 



"We were glad your Commissioner recommended you. From 
your psychic profile, we judged 
you to be a useful specimen. Cerebroanalysis confirmed our judgment. You are a practical man, 
Elijah. You do not moon romantically over Earth's past, despite your healthy interest in it. 
Nor do you blindly accept the 
City culture of the present. We 
felt that it was people such as 
yourself who could lead Earthmen to the stars once more. It 
was one reason Dr. Fastolfe was 
anxious to see you yesterday 
morning. 

"To be sure, your practical 
nature was embarrassingly intense. You refused to understand 
that the fanatical service of an 
ideal, even a mistaken ideal, may 
make a man do things quite beyond his ordinary capacity, as, 
for instance, crossing open country at night to destroy someone 
he considers an arch-enemy of 
his cause. We were not overly surprised, therefore, that you were 
stubborn and daring enough to 
attempt to prove the murder a 
fraud. In a way, it showed you 
were the man we wanted for our 
experiment." 

"For God's sake, what experiment?" 

"The experiment of persuading you that colonization was the 
answer to Earth's problems." R. 
Daneel spoke quietly. 



"Well, I was persuaded." 

"Yes, under the influence of 
the appropriate drug." 

Baley almost dropped the pipe 
he was carefully filling with precious rationed tobacco. Once 
again, he was seeing that scene 
in the Spacetown dome — himself 
swimming back to awareness 
after the shock of learning that 
R. Daneel was a robot, after all 
— R. Daneel' s smooth fingers 
pinching up the flesh of his arm 
— a hypo-sliver standing out 
darkly under his skin and then 
fading away. 

He said chokingly, "What was 
in the hypo-sliver?" 

"Nothing that need alarm you, 
Elijah. It was a mild drug intended only to make your mind 
more receptive." 

"And so I believed whatever 
was told me. Is that it?" He asked 
unevenly. 

"Not quite. You would not believe anything that was foreign 
to your basic thought pattern. In 
fact, the results of the experiment 
were disappointing. Dr. Fastolfe 
had hoped you would become 
fanatical on the subject. Instead, 
you became rather distantly approving and no more. Your practical nature stood in the way. It 
made us realize that our only 
hope was the romantics. And the 
romantics, unfortunately, were 
all Medievalists, actual or potential." 



142 




 



T> ALEY felt irrationally proud 
of himself, glad of his stubbornness and happy that he had 
disappointed them. Let them experiment with someone else. 

He grinned. "So now you've 
given up. You're going home." 

"No," R. Daneel answered. "I 
said a few moments ago that we 
were satisfied Earth would colonize. It was you who gave us the 
answer." 

"/ gave it to you? How?" 

"You spoke to Francis Clousarr concerning colonization. At 
least our experiment on you had 
that result. And Clousarr's aura 
changed." 

"You mean I convinced him I 
was right. Nonsense!" 

"Conviction does not come 
that easily. But the cerebric 
changes demonstrated conclusively that the Medievalist mind 
is open to that sort of conviction. 
The phenomenon called Medievalism is a frustrated wish to 
pioneer. To be sure, the direction 
in which that wish is directed at 
present is toward Earth. But the 
vision of distant worlds is a similar magnet and the romantic can 
turn to it easily. Clousarr felt the 
attraction as a result of a single 
lecture from you. 

"So, you see, we of Spacetown 
had already succeeded without 
knowing it. We ourselves, rather 
than anything we tried to introduce, were the unsettling factor. 



We crystallized the romantic impulses on Earth into Medievalism, 
and induced an organization. 
After all, it is the Medievalist 
who wishes to break the chains 
of custom, not the City officials 
who have most to gain from preserving the status quo. 

"If we leave behind a few obscure individuals or robots such 
as myself, who, together with 
sympathetic Earthmen such as 
yourself, can establish the training schools for emigrants that I 
spoke of, the Medievalist will 
eventually turn away from Earth. 
He will need robots and either 
get them from us or build his 
own. He will develop a C/Fe 
culture to suit himself." 

It was a long speech for R. 
Daneel. He must have realized 
that himself, for he added, * "I 
tell you all this to explain why it 
is necessary to do something that 
may hurt you." 

T IJE BALKY said, "Just a 
minute. Let me introduce a 
practical note. You'll go back to 
your worlds and say that an 
Earthman killed a Spacer and 
went unpunished. The Outer 
Worlds will demand an indemnity from Earth and Earth is no 
longer in a mood to give in to 
Spacer threats. There will be 
trouble." 

"I am sure that will not happen, Elijah. The elements on our 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



143 



planet most interested in pressing 
for an indemnity would also be 
most interested in forcing an end 
to Spacetown. We can easily 
offer the latter as an inducement 
to abandon the former. It is 
what we plan to do. Earth will be 
left in peace." 

Baley broke out, his voice 
hoarse with sudden despair, "And 
where does that leave me? The 
Commissioner will drop the Sarton investigation at once if 
Spacetown is willing, but the R. 
Sammy thing will have to continue hecause it points to conspiracy inside the Department. 
He'll be in any minute with a 
ream of evidence against me. I 
know that. It's been arranged. 
I'll be declassified, Daneel. 
There's Jessie to consider. 
There's Bentley — " 

R. Daneel said, "In the service 
of humanity's good, minor wrongs 
to individuals must be tolerated. 
Dr. Sarton has a surviving wife, 
two children, parents, a sister, 
many friends. All must grieve at 
his death and be saddened at the 
thought that his murderer has 
not been found and punished." 

"Then why not stay and find 
him?" 

"It is no longer necessary." 

Baley said bitterly, "Why not 
admit that the entire investigation was an excuse to study us 
under field conditions? You never 
cared who killed Dr. Sarton." 



"We would have liked to 
know," said R. Daneel coolly, 
"but we were never under any 
delusions as to which was more 
important, an individual or 
humanity. To continue the investigation would involve interfering with a situation which we 
now find satisfactory." 

"You mean the murderer might 
turn out to be a prominent Medievalist, and right now the 
Spacers don't want to do anything to antagonize their new 
friends." 

"It is not as I would say it. 
but there is truth in" your words." 
Daneel sounded faintly troubled. 

"Where's your justice circuit, 
Daneel? Is this justice?" 

"There are degrees of justice, 
Elijah. When the lesser is incompatible with the greater, the lesser must give way." 

It was as though Baley's mind 
were circling the impregnable 
logic of R. Daneel's positronic 
brain, searching for a loophole, a 
weakness. 

ITE said, "Have you no personal curiosity, Daneel? 
You've called yourself a detective. Do you know what that implies?" 

Baley's hopes, not strong in 
the first place, weakened as he 
spoke. The word "curiosity" 
brought back his own remarks to 
Francis Clousarr four hours be


144 




 



fore. He had known well enough 
then the qualities that marked off 
a man from a machine. Curiosity 
had to be one of them. 

R. Daneel echoed his thoughts 
by asking, "What do you mean 
by curiosity?" 

Baley sighed. "Curiosity is the 
name we give to a desire to extend one's knowledge." 

"Such a desire exists within 
me, when the extension of knowledge is necessary for the performance of an assigned task." 

"Yes," said Baley sarcastically, 
"like when you ask questions 
about Bentley's contact lenses 
in order to learn more of Earth's 
customs." 

"Precisely," R. Daneel agreed, 
with no sign of any awareness of 
sarcasm. "Aimless extension of 
knowledge, however, which is 
what I think you really mean by 
the term curiosity, is merely inefficiency. I am designed to avoid 
inefficiency." 

While R. Daneel spoke. Baley's 
mouth opened and stayed so. 
Somewhere, deep inside his unconscious, he had built a case, 
built it carefully and in detail, but 
had been brought up short by a 
single impossibility. One impossibility that could be neither 
jumped over, burrowed under 
nor shunted aside. 

But the inconsistency had vanished — the case was all in his 
hands — at last. 



T'HE glare of mental light appeared to have stimulated 
Baley mightily. At least, he suddenly knew what R. Daneel's 
weakness must be, the weakness 
of any thinking machine. The 
thing must be literal-minded. 

He said, "Then Project Spacetown is concluded as of today 
and with it the Sarton investigation. Is that it?" 

"That is the decision of our 
people at Spacetown," agreed R. 
Daneel. 

"But today is not , yet over." 
Baley looked at his watch. "There 
is an hour and a half until midnight Let's go on as before. It 
will do your people no harm. In 
fact, it will do them great good. 
My word upon it. It is only an 
hour and a half I ask." 

R. Daneel said, "What you say 
is correct. Today is not over. I 
had not thought of that, partner 
Elijah." 

Baley was "partner Elijah" 
again. He felt his muscles relax. 

He said, "Dr. Fastolfe spoke 
of a film of the scene of the murder when I was in Spacetown 
yesterday." 

"Yes. At the time, you were not 
interested." 

"At the time, I wasn't myself. 
It's different now. Can you get 
a copy of the film?" 

"Yes, partner Elijah." 

"I mean now — instantly!" 

"In ten minutes, if I can use 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



145 



the Department transmitter." 

The process took less than that. 
Baley stared at the small aluminum block he held in his trembling hands. Within it, the subtle 
forces transmitted from Spacetown had strongly fixed a certain 
atomic pattern. 

And at that moment, Commissioner Julius Enderby stood in 
the doorway. He saw Baley and 
anxiety passed from his round 
face, leaving behind it a look of 
growing thunder. 

He said, "Look here, Lije, 
you're taking a devil of a time 
eating." 

"I was bone-tired, Commissioner. Sorry if I've delayed you." 

"I wouldn't mind, only — you'd 
better come to my office.' 

Baley's eyes flicked toward R. 
Daneel, but met no answering 
look. He followed Enderby out. 

JULIUS ENDERBY nervously, 
tramped the floor before his 
desk. Baley watched him, himself far from composed. Occasionally, he glanced at his watch. 
It was 22:45. 

The Commissioner moved his 
glasses up onto his forehead and 
rubbed his eyes with thumb and 
forefinger. "Lije," he said suddenly, "when were you last in 
the Williamsburg power plant?" 

Baley said, "Yesterday, after 
I left the office. About 1800 or 
shortly thereafter/' 



The Commissioner shook his 
head. "Why didn't you say so 
sooner, Lije?" 

"I was going to. I haven't 
given an official statement yet." 

"What were you doing there?" 

"Just passing through, on our 
way to my temporary sleeping 
quarters." 

The Commissioner stopped 
short, stood before Baley and 
said, "That's no good, Lije. No 
one just passes through a power 
plant to get somewhere else." 

Baley shrugged. There was no 
point in going through the story 
of the pursuing Medievalists, of 
the dash along the strips. Not 
now. 

He said, "If you're trying to 
hint that I had an opportunity 
to get the alpha-sprayer that 
knocked out R. Sammy, Daneel 
was with me and will testify I 
went right through the plant 
without stopping." 

Slowly, the Commissioner sat 
down. He did not look in R. 
Daneel's direction or offer - to 
speak to him. "Lije, I don't know 
what to say or what to think. 
And it's no use having your — 
your partner as alibi. He can't 
give evidence." 

"I still deny that I took an 
alpha-sprayer." 

The Commissioner's fingers 
intertwined. He said, "Why did 
Jessie come to see you here this 
afternoon?" 



146 




 



"You asked me that before 
Commissioner. Same answer. 
Family matters." 

"I've got information from 
Francis Clousarr, Lije." 

"What kind of information?" 

"He claims that a Jezebel 
Baley is a member of a Medievalist society dedicated to the 
overthrow of the government by 
force." 

"Are you sure he has the right 
person? There are many Baleys." 

"There aren't many Jezebel 
Baleys." 

"He said Jezebel?" 

"I heard him, Lije." 

" A LL right," Baley said. "Jessie was a member of a 
harmless lunatic-fringe organization. She never did anything but 
attend meetings and feel devilish 
about it." 

"It won't look that way to a 
board of review, Lije." 

"You mean I'm going to be 
suspended and held on suspicion 
of destroying government property in the form of R. Sammy?" 

"I hope not, Lije, but it looks 
bad. Everyone knows you didn't 
like R. Sammy. Your wife was 
seen talking to him this afternoon. She was in tears and some 
of her words were heard. They 
were harmless in themselves, but 
two and two can be added up, 
Lije. And you had an opportunity to obtain the weapon." 



Baley interrupted. "If I were 
wiping out all evidence against 
Jessie, would I arrest Francis 
Clousarr? He seems to know a 
lot more about her than R. Sammy could have. Another thing. 
I passed through the power plant 
eighteen hours before R. Sammy 
spoke to Jessie. Did I know, that 
long in advance, I would have to 
destroy him, and pick up an 
alpha-sprayer by pure clairvoyance?" 

The Commissioner said, "Those 
are good objections. I'll do my 
best." 

"Yes? Do you really believe I 
didn't do it, Commissioner?" 

Enderby said slowly, "I don't 
know what to think." 

"Then I'll tell you. Commissioner, this is all a careful and 
elaborate frame." 

"Now wait, Lije! Don't strike 
out blindly. You won't get any 
sympathy with that line of defense." 

"I'm not after sympathy. I'm 
just telling the truth. I'm being 
taken out of circulation to prevent me from learning the facts 
about the Sarton murder. Unfortunately for my framing pal, 
it's too late for that." 

"What!" 

Baley looked at his watch. It 
was 23:00. 

He said, "I know who is framing me and I know how Dr. Sarton was killed and by whom, and 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



147 



I have one hour to tell you about 
it, catch the man and end the 
investigation." 

CHAPTER XVIII 

^COMMISSIONER * Enderby's 
eyes narrowed and he glared 
at Baley. "You tried something 
like this in Spacetown yesterday morning. Not again." 

Baley nodded. "I know. I was 
wrong the first time." 

He thought fiercely: Also the 
second time. But not now! 

He said, "Judge for yourself, 
Commissioner. Grant that the 
evidence against me has been 
planted. Go that far with me and 
see where it takes you. Ask yourself who could have planted that 
evidence. Obviously, only someone who knew I was in the 
Williamsburg plant yesterday 
evening." 

"All right — who?" asked 
Enderby. 

"I was followed out of the 
kitchen by a .Medievalist group. 
I lost them, or I thought I did, 
but obviously at least one of them 
saw me pass through the plant. 
My only purpose in going 
through was to lose them." 

The Commissioner considered. 
"Clousarr? Was he with them?" 

Baley nodded. 

Enderby said, "All right, we'll 
question him." 

"Don't stop there, Commis


sioner. Ke.ep thinking." 

"Clousarr saw you go into the 
Williamsburg power plant, or 
else someone in his group did 
and passed the information along 
to him. He decided to utilize that 
fact to get you into trouble and 
off the investigation. Is that what 
you're saying?" 

"It's close." 

"Good." The Commissioner 
seemed to warm to the task. "He 
knew your wife was a member of 
his organization, naturally, and 
so he knew you wouldn't face a 
really close probe into your private life. He thought you would 
resign rather than fight circumstantial evidence. By the way, 
Lije, what about a resignation?" 

"Not in a million years, Commissioner." 

Enderby shrugged. "Well, so 
he got an alpha-sprayer, presumably through a confederate 
in the plant, and had another 
confederate arrange the destruction of R. Sammy." His fingers 
drummed lightly on the desk. 
"No good, Lije." 

"Why not?" 

' "Too far-fetched. Too many 
confederates. And he has a castiron alibi for the night and morning of the Spacetown murder. We 
checked that almost right away." 

"I never said it was Clousarr, 
Commissioner. You did. It could 
be anyone in the Medievalist organisation. Clousarr is just the 




 



owner of a face that Daneel happened to recognize. Though there 
is one queer thing about him." 

"What?" . asked Enderby. 

"He did know Jessie was a 
member. Does he know every 
member in the organization, do 
you suppose?" 

"I have no idea. He knew about 
Jessie, anyway. Maybe she was 
important because she was the 
wife of a policeman." 

"He came right out and said 
Jezebel Baley was a member — 
just like that? Jezebel Baley?" 

piNDERBY nodded. "I heard 
■"-^ him myself, Lije." 

"That's the funny thing. Commissioner," said Baley. "Jessie 
hasn't used her full first name 
since before Bentley was born. 
Not once. I know that for a fact. 
She joined the Medievalists after 
she dropped her full name. How 
would Clousarr know her as Jezebel then?" 

The Commissioner said, "Oh? 
Well, he probably said Jessie. I 
guess I just filled it in automatically — " 

"Until now you were quite 
sure he said Jezebel. I asked several times." 

The Commissioner's voice rose. 
"You're not saying I'm a liar, are 
you?" 

"I'm just wondering if Clousarr said nothing at all. You've 
known Jessie for twenty years 



and you knew her name was 
Jezebel." 

"You're off your head, man." 

"Am I? Where were you after 
lunch today? You were out of 
your office for two hours, at 
least." 

"Are you questioning me?" 

"I'll answer for you, too. You 
were in the Williamsburg power 
plant." 

The Commissioner jumped up 
from his seat. His forehead glistened. "What the hell are you 
trying to say?" 

"Weren't you?" 

"Baley, you're suspended. Hand 
me your credentials." 

"Not till you hear me out." 

"I don't intend to. You're 
guilty. What gets me is your 
cheap attempt to make me. look 
as though I were conspiring 
against you. In fact, you're under arrest." 

"No," said Baley. "Not yet. 
Commissioner. I've got a blaster 
on you. Don't fool with me. 
please, because I intend to have 
my say. Afterward, you can do 
what you please." 

With widening eyes, Julius Enderby stammered, "Twenty years 
for this, Baley, in the deepest 
prison level in the City." 

For the first time since R. 
Daneel had entered the City, the 
Commissioner spoke directly to 
the robot. "Hold him, you. First 
Law!" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL

RDANEEL moved sudden• ly. His hand clamped down 
on Baley's wrist. He said quietly,, 
"I cannot permit this, partner 
Elijah. You must do no harm to 
the Commissioner." 

"I have no intention of hurting him, Daneel. You said you 
would help me clear this up. I 
have 45 minutes." 

R. Daneel, without releasing 
Baley's wrist, said, "Commissioner, I believe Elijah should be 
allowed to speak. I am in communication with Dr. Fastolfe at 
this moment." 

"How? How?" demanded the 
Commissioner wildly. 

"Self-contained sub-etheric 
unit," explained Baley. "He's a 
great little model of a robot, 
Commissioner." 

"I am in communication with 
Dr. Fastolfe," the robot went on 
inexorably, "and it would make 
a bad impression, Commissioner, 
if you were to refuse to listen to 
Elijah. Damaging inferences 
might be drawn." 

The Commissioner fell back 
in his chair. 

"I say you were in the Williamsburg power plant today, 
Commissioner," Baley said. "You 
got the alpha-sprayer and gave 
it to R. Sammy. You deliberately chose the Williamsburg power 
plant in order to incriminate me. 
You even seized on Dr. Gerrigel's 
reappearance to invite him down 



to the Department and give him 
a deliberately maladjusted guiderod to lead him to the photographic supply room and. allow 
him to find R. Sammy's remains. 
You counted on him to make a 
correct diagnosis." 

Baley put away his blaster. "If 
you want to have me arrested 
now, go ahead, but Spacetown 
won't take that for an answer." 

"Motive," spluttered Enderby 
breathlessly. His glasses were 
fogged and he removed them, 
looking once again curiously 
vague and helpless in their absence. "What motive could I have 
for this?" 

"You got me into trouble, 
didn't you? It will put a spoke 
in the Sarton investigation, won't 
it? And all that aside, R. Sammy 
knew too much." 

"About what, in Heaven's 
name?" 

"About the way in which a 
Spacer was murdered five and a 
half days ago. You see, Commissioner, you murdered Dr. Sarton 
of Spacetown." 




'OMMISSIONER Enderby 
1 shook his head violently. 



R. Daneel said, "Partner Elijah, you know it is impossible 
for Commissioner Enderby to 
have murdered Dr. Sarton." 

"Listen. Enderby begged me to 
take the case. Why? In the first 
place, we were college friends and 



150 




 



he thought he could count on my 
loyalty-index. Secondly, he knew 
Jessie was a member of an underground organization and he 
counted on blackmailing me into 
silence if I g<^ too close to the 
truth. But he wasn't really worried about that. At the very beginning, he did his best to arouse 
my distrust of you, Daneel, to 
make certain the two of us worked at cross -purposes. He knew 
about my father's declassification. He could guess how I would 
react." 

The Commissioner said weakly, "How could I know about 
Jessie?" He turned to* the robot. 
"You — if you're transmitting this 
to Spacetown — tell them it's a 
lie!" 

Baley broke in, "Certainly you 
would know about Jessie. You're 
a Medievalist and part of the 
organization. Your old-fashioned 
spectacles! Your windows! It's 
obvious. 

"And there's better evidence. 
How did Jessie find out Daneel 
was a robot? Through her Medievalist organization, of course. 
But that just shoves the problem 
one step backward. How did 
they know? 

"You, Commissioner, dismissed it with a theory that Daneel 
was recognized as a robot during 
the incident at the shoe counter. 
I couldn't believe that. I took 
him for human when I first saw 

THE CAVES OF STEEL 



him, and there's nothing wrong 
with my eyes. 

"Yesterday, I asked Dr. Gerrigel to come in from Washington. At the time, my only 
purpose was to see if he would 
recognize Daneel for what he was, 
with no prompting on my part. 
Commissioner, he didn't! I introduced him to Daneel, he shook 
hands with him, we all talked 
together and it was only after 
the subject got around to humanoid robots that he suddenly 
caught on. Now that was Dr. Gerrigel, Earth's greatest expert on 
robots. Do you mean to say a few 
Medievalist rioters could do better? 

"It's obvious now that the 
Medievalists must have known 
Daneel was a robot to begin with. 
The incident at the shoe counter 
was deliberately arranged to show 
Daneel and, through him, Spacetown, the extent of anti- robot 
feeling in the City. It was meant 
to confuse the issue. 

"Now if they knew the truth 
about Daneel to begin with, who 
told them? I didn't. I once 
thought it was Daneel himself, 
but that's out. The only other 
Earthman who knew about it was 
you, Commissioner." 

"I^NDERBY said, "There could 
be spies in the Department, 
too. The Medievalists could have 
us riddled with them. Your wife 

151 



was one, and if you don't find it 
impossible that I should be one, 
why not others in the Department?" 

Baley shook his head. "Let's 
not bring up mysterious spies 
until we see where the straightforward solution leads us. 

"It's interesting, now that I 
look back on it, Commissioner, 
to see how your spirits rose and 
fell in direct ratio with my nearness to the solution. When I 
wanted to visit Spacetown yesterday morning and wouldn't tell 
you the reason, you were in a 
state of agitation. Did you think 
I had you pinned, Commissioner? 

"Then when I came out with 
my completely wrong solution 
and you saw how immensely far 
from the truth I was, you were 
confident again, you even argued 
with me — defended the Spacers. 
After that, you were master of 
yourself for a while — quite confident. 

"Then I put in my call for Dr. 
Gerrigel, and you wanted to know 
why, and I wouldn't tell you. 
That plunged you into the abyss 
again, because you feared — " 

R. Daneel suddenly raised his 
hand. "Partner Elijah!" 

• Baley looked at his watch — 
23:42! He said, "What is it?" 

R. Daneel said, "He might have 
been disturbed at thinking you 
would find out his Medievalist 
connections, if we grant their ex
152 



istence. There is nothing, though, 
to connect him with the murder." 

Baley said, "You're wrong, Daneel. He didn't know what I 
wanted Dr. Gerrigel for, but it 
was safe to assume that it was 
for information about robots. 
This frightened the Commissioner, because a robot had an intimate connection with his greater 
crime. Isn't that so, Commissioner?" 

Enderby raised his head and 
glowered. "When this is over — " 
he began. 

"How was the murder committed?" interrupted Baley with 
a suppressed fury. "C/Fe! I use 
your own term, Daneel. You're 
so full of the benefits of a C/Fe 
culture, yet you don't see where 
an Earthman might have used it 
for at least a temporary advantage. Let me sketch it in for you. 

"There is no inconsistency in 
the notion of a robot crossing 
open country. Even at night. 
Even alone. The Commissioner 
put a blaster into R. Sammy's 
hand, told him where to go and 
when. He himself entered Spacetown through the Personal and 
was relieved of his own blaster. 
He t received the other from R. 
Sammy's hands, killed Dr. Sarton, returned the blaster to R. 
Sammy, who took it back across 
the fields to New York City. And 
today he destroyed R. Sammy, 
who had become dangerous. 


 



l 



"That explains the whole thing. 
The presence of the Commissioner, the absence of a weapon. 
And it makes it unnecessary to 
suppose any human New Yorker 
had walked a mile under the 
open sky alone at night." 

A T the end of Baley's accusation, R. Daneel said, "I am 
sorry, partner Elijah, though 
happy for the Commissioner, that 
your story explains nothing. 1 
have told you that the cerebroanalysis of the Commissioner 
proves that it is impossible for 
him to have committed deliberate murder." 

"Thank you," muttered Enderby. His voice gained strength 
and confidence. "I don't know 
what your motives are, Baley, 
or why you should try to ruin me 
this way, but — " 

"Wait," said Baley. "I'm not 
through. I've got this." 

He slammed the aluminum 
cube on Enderby's desk, tried to 
feel the confidence he hoped he 
was radiating. For half an hour, 
he had been hiding from himself 
one disturbing fact — that he did 
not know what the picture showed. He was gambling, but it was 
all he could do now. 

Enderby shrank away from the 
small object. "What is it?" 

"It isn't a bomb," said Baley 
sardonically. "Just an ordinary 
micro-projector." 



"Well? What will it prove?" 
the Commissioner asked. 

"Suppose We see." His fingernail probed at one of the slits in 
the cube, and a corner of the 
Commissioner's office blanked 
out, then lit up in an alien scene 
in three dimensions. It reached 
from floor to ceiling and extended out past the walls of the room. 
It was awash with a gray light 
of a sort the City's utilities never 
provided. 

Baley thought, with a pang of 
mingled distaste and perverse 
attraction: It must be this "dawn" 
they talk about. 

The pictured scene was of Dr. 
Sarton's dome. Dr. Sarton's dead 
body, a horrible, broken remnant, 
filled its center. Enderby's eyes 
bulged as he stared. 

Baley said, "I know the Commissioner isn't a killer. I don't 
need you to tell me that, Daneel. 
If I could have gotten around 
that one fact earlier, I would 
have had the solution earlier. Actually, I didn't see a way out of 
it until an hour ago, when I angrily reminded you that you had 
once been curious about Bentley's contact lenses. 

"That was it, Commissioner. It 
occurred to me then that your 
near-sightedness and your glasses were the key. They don't have 
near-sightedness on the Outer 
Worlds, I suppose, or they might 
have reached the true solution of 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



153 



the murder almost at once. Commissioner, when did you break 
your glasses?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"When I first saw you about 
this case," Baley said, "you told 
me you had broken your glasses 
in Spacetown. I assumed that 
you broke them in your agitation 
on hearing the news of the murder, but you never said so. Actually, if you were entering Spacetown with crime on your mind, 
you were already agitated enough 
to drop and break your glasses 
before the murder. Isn't that so?" 

R. Daneel said, "I do not see 
the point, partner Elijah." 

T> ALEY was manipulating Sarton's dome-image as he was 
speaking. Clumsily, he expanded 
it, his fingernails unsure in the 
tension that was overwhelming 
him. Slowly, the corpse widened, broadened, heightened, came 
closer. Baley could almost smell 
the stench of scorched flesh. 

Baley cast a side-glance at the 
Commissioner. Enderby had closed his eyes. He looked sick. Baley felt sick, too, but he had" to 
look. Slowly he circled the trimensional image by means of the 
transmitter controls — rotating it, 
bringing the ground about the 
corpse into view in successive 
quadrants. 

He was still talking. He had to. 
He couldn't stop till he found 



what he was looking for. He said, 
"The Commissioner can't commit deliberate murder. True! But 
any man can kill by accidenr. 
The Commissioner didn't enter 
Spacetown to kill Dr. Sarton. He 
came in to kill you, Daneel. You! 

"He is a Medievalist, an earnest one. He cooperated with Dr. 
Sarton and knew the purpose for 
which you were designed, Daneel. 
He feared that purpose might be 
achieved, that Earthmen would 
eventually be weaned away from 
Earth. So he decided to destroy 
you, Daneel. You were the only 
one of your type manufactured 
as yet, and he had good reason to 
think that, by demonstrating the 
extent and determination of Medievalism on Earth, he would discourage the Spacers. 

"I don't say even the thought 
of killing you, Daneel, was a 
pleasant one. He would have had 
R. Sammy do it, I imagine, if 
you didn't look so human that a 
primitive rpbot like Sammy could 
not have told the difference, or 
understood it. First Law would 
stop him. Or the Commissioner 
would have had another human 
do it if he himself were not the 
only one who had ready access 
to Spacetown at all times. 

"Let me reconstruct what the 
Commissioner's plan might have 
been. He made the appointment 
with Dr. Sarton, but deliberately 
came early — at dawn, in fact. Dr. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



155 



Sarton would be sleeping, but 
you, Daneel, would be awake. I 
assume, by the way, you were 
living with Dr. Sarton, Daneel?" 

rTlHE robot nodded. "You are 
quite right, partner Elijah." 

Baley said, "You would come 
to the Dome door, Daneel, receive 
a blaster charge in the chest or 
head and be done with. The 
Commissioner would leave quickly, through the deserted streets of 
Spacetown's dawn, and back to 
where R. Sammy waited. He 
would give the robot back the 
blaster, then slowly walk again 
to Dr. Sarton's Dome. If necessary, he would 'discover' the body 
himself. How close am I,' Commissioner?" 

Enderby writhed. "I didn't — " 

"No," said Baley, "you didn't 
kill Daneel. He's here, and in all 
the time he's been in the City, 
you haven't been able to look 
him in the face or address him by 
name. Look at him now, Commissioner:*' 

Enderby couldn't. He covered 
his face with shaking hands. 

"I'll tell you what did happen," went on Baley inexorably. 
"You were at the Dome when 
you dropped your glasses. You 
must have been nervous. I've seen 
you when you're upset. You take 
the glasses off, wipe them — you 
did that then. But your hands 
were shaking and you dropped 



them. Perhaps you stepped on 
them. Anyway, they were broken 
and, just then, the door opened 
and a figure that looked like Daneel faced you. 

"You blasted him, scrabbled 
up the remains of your glasses 
and ran. They found the body, 
not you, and when they came to 
find you, you discovered that it 
was not Daneel but the earlyrising Dr. Sarton you had killed. 
Dr. Sarton had designed Daneel 
in his own image, to his great 
misfortune. If you want the tangible proof, it's there!" 

The image of Sarton's Dome 
quivered and Baley put the transmitter carefully upon the desk, 
his hand tightly upon it. 

Commissioner Enderby's face 
was distorted with terror and Baley's with tension. R. Daneel, as 
always, was emotionless. 

Baley's finger was pointing. 
"That glitter in the grooves of 
the door. What was it, Daneel?" 

"Two small slivers of glass," 
said the robot coolly. "It meant 
nothing to us." 

"It will now. They're bits of 
concave lenses. Measure them 
and compare the results with 
those of the glasses Enderby is 
wearing now. Don't smash them, 
Commissioner I" 

He lunged and wrenched them 
from the Commissioner's hand. 
He held them out to R. Daneel. 
"That's proof enough, I think,

that he was at the Dome earlier 
than he was thought to be." 

R. Daneel said, "I am quite 
convinced. I can see now that I 
was thrown completely off the 
scent by the Commissioner's cerebroanalysis. I congratulate you, 
partner Elijah." 

Baley's watch said 24:00. A 
new day was beginning. 

SLOWLY, the Commissioner's 
head sank down on his arms. 
His words were muffled wails. 
"It was a mistake. I never meant 
to kill him." Without warning, 
he slipped from the chair and lay 
crumpled on the floor. 

R. Daneel sprang to him, saying, "You have hurt him, Elijah!" 



"He isn't dead, is he?" 

"No. Unconscious." 

"He'll come to. It was too much 
for him, I suppose. I had to do 
it, Daneel. I had no evidence that 
would stand up in court — only 
inferences. I had to badger him 
and let it out little by little, hoping he would break down. He 
did, Daneel. You heard him confess, didn't you?" 

"Yes." 

"Now, then, I promised this 
would be to the benefit of Space town's project, so . . . Wait, he's 
coming to." 

The Commissioner groaned. 
He stared speechlessly at them. 

Baley said, "Commissioner, do 
you hear me?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



157 



The Commissioner nodded 
listlessly. 

"All right, then. The Spacers 
have more on their minds than 
your prosecution. If you cooperate with them — " 

"What? What?" There was a 
dawning flicker of hope in the 
Commissioner's eyes. 

"You must be a big wheel in 
New York's Medievalist organization, maybe even in the planetary setup. Maneuver them 
toward the colonization of space. 
You can see the propaganda line, 
can't you? We can go back to 
the soil, all right — but on other 
planets." 

"I don't understand," mumbled 
the Commissioner. 

R. Daneel said, "Elijah is quite 
correct. Help us, Commissioner, 
and we will forget the past. I am 
speaking for Dr. Fastolfe and our 
people generally in this. Of 
course, if you should agree to 
help and later betray us, we 
would always have the fact of 
your guilt to hold over your head. 
I hope you understand that, too. 
It pains me to have to mention it," 

"I won't be prosecuted?" asked 
the Commissioner. 

"Not if you help us." 

Tears filled his eyes. "I'll do it. 
It was an accident. Explain that 
— an accident. I did what I 
thought right." 

Baley said, "If you help us, 
you will be doing right. The col


onization of space is the only 
possible salvation of Earth. You'll 
realize that if you think about it 
without prejudice. If you find 
you cannot, have a short talk 
with Dr. Fastolfe. And now you 
can begin to help by quashing 
the R. Sammy business. Call this 
one an accident also. End it!" 

T>ALEY got to his feet. He 
added, "And remember, I'm 
not the only one who knows the 
truth, Commissioner. Getting rid 
of me will ruin you. All Spacetown knows. You see that, don't 
you?" 

R. Daneel said, "It is unnecessary to say more, Elijah. He is 
sincere. He will help. So much 
is obvious from his cerebroanalysis." 

"Then I can go home. I want 
to see Jessie and Bentley and 
take up a natural life again. And 
I want to sleep. Daneel, will you 
stay on Earth after the Spacers 
go?" 

R. Daneel said, "I may, along 
with others. It has not been decided. Why do you ask?" 

Baley bit his lip. "I didn't 
think I would ever say anything 
like this to anyone like you, Daneel, but I trust you. I even — 
admire you. I'm too old ever to 
leave Earth myself, but when 
schools for emigrants are finally 
established, there's Bentley. If 
someday Bentley and you, to


158 




 



gether might be able to . . ." 

"Perhaps." R. Daneel's face 
was emotionless. 

He turned to Julius Enderby, 
who was watching them with a 
flaccid face into which a certain 
vitality was only now beginning 
to* return. 

The robot said, "I have been 
trying, friend Julius, to understand some remarks Elijah made 
to me earlier. Perhaps I am beginning to, for it suddenly seems 
to me that the destruction of what 



should not be — that is, the destruction of what you people call 
evil — is less just and desirable 
than the conversion of this evil 
into what you call good." 

He hesitated. Then, almost as 
though he were surprised at his 
own words, he said, "Go, and sin 
no more!" 

Baley, smiling, took R. Daneel's elbow and they walked out 
the door, fleshly arm in robotic 
arm.
