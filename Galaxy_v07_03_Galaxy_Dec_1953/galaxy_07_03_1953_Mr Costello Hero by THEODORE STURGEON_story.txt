Mr. Costello, Hero by THEODORE STURGEON

"COME in - And 
shut the door." 

"I beg your pardon, 
sir?" The Skipper never invited 
anyone in — not to his quarters. 
His office, yes, but not here. 

He made an abrupt gesture, 
and I came in and closed the 
door. It was about as luxurious 
as a compartment on a spaceship 
can get. I tried not to goggle at 
it as if it was the first time I 
had ever seen it, just because it 
was the first time I had ever seen 
it. 

I sat down. 

He opened his mouth, closed 
it, forced the tip of his tongue 
through his thin lips. He licked 
them and glared at me. I'd never 
seen the Iron Man like this. I decided that the best thing to say 
would be nothing, which is what 
I said. 

He pulled a deck of cards out 



of the top-middle drawer and 
slid them across the desk. "Deal." 
I said, "I Id — " 

"And don't say you beg my 
pardon !" he exploded. 

Well, all right. If the skipper 
wanted a cozy game of gin rummy to while away the parsecs, far 
be it from me to. . . I shuffled. 
Six years under this cold-blooded, fish-eyed automatic computer 
with eyebrows, and this was the 
first time that he — 

"Deal," he said. I looked up at 
him. "Draw, five-card draw. You 
do play draw poker, don't you, 
Purser?" 

"Yes, sir." I dealt and put 
down the pack. I had three threes 
and a couple of court cards. The 
skipper scowled at his hand and 
threw down two. He glared at. 
me again. 

I said, "I got three of a kind, 
sir."

TTE let his cards go as if they 
no longer existed, slammed 
out of his chair and turned his 
back to me. He tilted his head 
back and stared up at the seeit-all, with its complex- of speed, 
time, position and distance-run 
coordinates. Borinquen, our destination planet, was at spitting 
distance — only a day or so off — 
and Earth was a long, long way 
behind. I heard a sound and 
dropped my eyes. The Skipper's 
hands were locked behind him, 
squeezed together so hard that 
they crackled. 

"Why didn't you draw?" he 
grated. 

"I beg your—'* 

"When I played poker — and I 
used to play a hell of a lot of 
poker — as I recall it, the dealer 
would find out how many cards 
each player wanted after the 
deal and give him as many as he 
discarded. Did you ever hear of 
that, Purser?" 

"Yes, sir, I did." 

"You did" He turned around. 
I imagine he had been scowling 
this same way at the see-it-all, 
and I wondered why it was he 
hadn't shattered the cover glass. 

M Why, then. Purser," he demanded, "did you show your 
three of a kind without discarding, without drawing — without, 
mister, asking me how many 
cards I might want?" 

I thought about it. "I — we — I 



mean, sir, we haven't been playing poker that way lately." 

"You've been playing poker 
without drawing!" He sat down 
again and beamed that glare at 
me again. "And who changed the 
rules?" 

"I don't know, sir. We just — 
that's the way we've been playing." 

He nodded thoughtfully. "Now 
tell me something, Purser. How 
much time did you spend in the 
galley during the last watch?" 

"About an hour, sir." 

"About an hour." 

"Well, sir," I explained hurriedly, "it was my turn." 

He said nothing, and it suddenly occurred to me that these 
galley -watches weren't in the 
ship's orders. 

I said quickly, "It isn't against 
your orders to stand such a 
watch, is it, sir?" 

"No," he said, "it isn't." His 
voice was so gentle, it was ugly. 
■"Tell me, Purser, doesn't Cooky 
mind these galley-watches?" 

"Oh, no, sir! He's real pleased 
about it." I knew he was thinking 
about the size of the galley. It 
was true that two men made 
quite a crowd in a place like that. 
I said, "That way, he knows everybody can trust him." 

"You mean that way you know 
he won't poison you." 

"Well — yes, sir." 

"And tell me," he said, his 



60 




 



voice even gentler, "who suggested he might poison you?" 

"I really couldn't say, Captain. 
It's just sort of something that 
came up. Cooky doesn't mind," 
I added. "If he's watched all the 
time, he knows nobody's going to 
suspect him. It's all right." 

A GAIN he repeated my words. 

"It's all right." I wished he 
wouldn't, I wished he'd stop 
looking at me like that. "How 
long," he asked, "has it been 
customary for the deck officer to 
bring a witness with him when he 
takes over the watch?" 

"I really couldn't say, sir. 
That's out of my department." 

"You couldn't say. Now think 
hard, Purser. Did you ever stand 
galley -watches, or see deck-officers bring witnesses with them 
when they relieve the bridge, or 
see draw poker played without 
drawing — before this trip?" 

"Well, no, sir. I don't think I 
have. I suppose we just never 
thought of it before." 

"We never had Mr. Costello as 
a passenger before, did we?" 

"No, sir." 

I thought for a moment he 
was going to say something else, 
but he didn't, just: "Very well, 
Purser. That will be alL" 

I went out and started back 
aft, feeling puzzled and sort of 
upset. The Skipper didn't have 
to hint things like that about Mr. 



Costello. Mr. Costello was a very 
nice man. Once, the Skipper had 
picked a fight with Mr. Costello. 
They'd shouted at each other 
in the dayroom. That is, the 
Skipper had shouted — Mr. Costello never did. Mr. Costello was 
as good-natured as they come. 
A big good-natured soft-spoken 
man, with the kind of face they 
call open. Open and honest. He'd 
once been a Triumver back on 
Earth — the youngest ever appointed, they said. 

You wouldn't think such an 
easygoing man was as smart as 
that. Triumvers are usually lifetime appointees, but Mr. Costello wasn't satisfied. Had to keep 
moving, you know. Learning all 
the time, shaking hands all 
around, staying close to the people. He loved people. 

I don't know why the Skipper 
couldn't get along with him. 
Everybody else did. And besides 
— Mr. Costello didn't play poker; 
why should he care one way or 
the other how we played it? He 
didn't eat the galley food — he 
had his own stock in his cabin — 
so what difference would it make 
to him if the cook poisoned anyone? Except, of course, that he 
cared about us. People — he liked 
people. 

Anyway, it's better to play 
poker without the draw. Poker's 
a good game with a bad reputation. And where do you suppose 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



61 



it gets the bad reputation? From 
cheaters. And how do people 
cheat at poker? Almost never 
when they deal. It's when they 
pass out cards after the discard. 
That's when a shady dealer 
knows what he holds, and he 
knows what to give the others so 
he can win. All right, remove the 
discard and you remove ninetenths of the cheaters. Remove 
the cheaters and the honest men 
can trust each other. 

That's what Mr. Costello used 
to say, anyhow. Not that he cared 
one way or the other for himself. He wasn't a gambling man. 

T WENT into the dayroom and 
there was Mr. Costello with 
the Third Officer. He gave me a 
big smile and a wave, so I went 
over. 

"Come on, sit down, Purser," 
he said. "I'm landing tomorrow. 
Won't have much more chance to 
talk to you." 

I sat down. The Third snapped 
shut a book he'd been holding 
open on the table and sort of got 
it out of sight. 

Mr. Costello laughed at him. 
"Go ahead. Third, show the Purser. You can trust him — he's a 
good man. I'd be proud to be 
shipmates with the Purser." 

The Third hesitated and then 
raised the book from his lap. It 
was the Space Code and expanded Rules of the Road. Every li


censed officer has to bone up on 
it a lot, to get his license. But it's 
not the kind of book you ordinarily kill time with. 

"The Third here was showing 
me all about what a captain can 
and can't do," said Mr. Costello. 

"Well, you asked me to," the 
Third said. 

"Now just a minute," said Mr. 
Costello rapidly, "now just a 
minute." He had a way of doing 
that sometimes. It was part of 
him, like the thinning hair on 
top of his head and the big 
smile and the way he had of 
cocking his head to one side and 
asking you what it was you just 
said, as if he didn't hear so well. 
"Now just a minute, you wanted 
to show me this material, didn't 
you?" 

"Well, yes, Mr. Costello," the 
Third said. 

"You're going over the limitations of a spacemaster's power of 
your own free will, aren't you?" 

"Well," said the Third, "I 
guess so. Sure." 

"Sure," Mr. Costello repeated 
happily. "Tell the Purser the 
part you just read to me." 

"The one you found in the 
book?" 

"You know the one. You read 
it out your own self, didn't you?" 

"Oh," said the Third. He looked at me — sort of uneasily, I 
thought — and reached for the 
book. 



62 




 



Mr. Costello put his hand on 
it. "Oh, don't bother looking it 
up," he said. "You can remember 
it." 

"Yeah,. I guess I do," the Third 
admitted. "It's a sort of safeguard against letting a skipper's 
power go to his head, in case it 
ever does. Suppose a time comes 
when a captain begins to act up, 
and the crew gets the idea that 
a lunatic has taken over the 
bridge. Well, something has to 
be done about it. The crew has 
the power to appoint one officer 
and send him up to the Captain 
for an accounting. If the Skipper 
refuses, or if the crew doesn't like 
his accounting, then they have 
the right to confine him to his 
quarters and take over the ship." 

"I think I heard about that," 
I said. "But the Skipper has 
rights, too. I mean the crew has 
to report everything by spaceradio the second it happens, and 
then the Captain has a full hearing along with the crew at the 
next port." 

T1MR. Costello looked at us and 
-J-*-*- shook his big head, full of 
admiration. When Mr. Costello 
thought you were good, it made 
you feel good all over. 

The Third looked at his watch 
and got up. "I got to relieve the 
bridge. Want to come along; Purser?" 

"I'd like to talk to him for a 



while," Mr. Costello said. "Do 
you suppose you could get somebody else for a witness?" 

"Oh, sure, if you say so," said 
the Third. 

"But you're going to get someone." 

"Absolutely," said the Third. 

"Safest ship I was ever on," 
said Mr. Costello. "Gives a fellow a nice feeling to know that 
the watch is never going to get 
the orders wrong." 

I thought so myself and wondered why we never used to do it 
before. I watched the Third leave 
and stayed where I was, feeling 
good, feeling safe, feeling glad 
that Mr. Costello wanted to talk 
to me. And me just a Purser, him 
an ex-Triumver. 

Mr. Costello gave me the big 
smile. He nodded toward the 
door. "That young .fellow's going 
far. A good man. You're all good 
men here." He stuck a suckercup in the heater and passed it 
over to me with his own hands. 
"Coffee," he said. "My own 
brand. All I ever use." 

I tasted it and it was fine. He 
was a very generous man. He sat 
back and beamed at me while I 
drank it. 

"What do you know about 
Borinquen?" he wanted to know. 

I told him all I could. Borinquen's a pretty nice place, what 
they call "four-nines Earth Normal" — which means that the cli


MR . COSTELLO. HERO 



63 



mate, gravity, atmosphere and 
ecology come within .9999 of 
being the same as Earth's. There 
are only about six known planets 
like that. I told him about the 
one city it had and the trapping 
that used to be the main industry. Coats made out of glunker fur last forever. They shine 

green in white light and a real 
warm ember-red in blue light, 
and you can take a full-sized 
coat and scrunch it up and hide 
it in your two hands, it's that 
light and fine. Being so light, the 
fur made ideal space- cargo. 

Of course, there was a lot more 
on Borinquen now — rare isotope 
ingots and foodstuffs and seeds 
for the drug business and all, and 
I suppose the glunker trade could 
dry right up and Borinquen could 
still carry its weight. But furs 
settled the planet, furs supported 
the city in the early days, and 
half the population still lived 
out in the bush and trapped. 

Mr. Costello listened to everything I said in a way I can only 
call respectful. 

I remember I finished up by 
saying, "I'm sorry you have to 
get off there, Mr. Costello. I'd 
like to see you some more. I'd 
like to come see you at Borinquen, whenever we put in, though 
I don't suppose a man like you 
would have much spare time." 

He put his big hand on my 
arm. "Purser, if I don't have time 



when you're in port, I'll make 
time. Hear?" Oh, he had a wonderful way of making a fellow 
feel good. 

"VTEXT thing you know, he in
' vited me right into his cabin. 
He sat me down and handed me 
a sucker full of a mild red wine 
with a late flavor of cinnamon, 
which was a new one on me, and 
he showed me some of his things. 

He was a great collector. He 
had one or two little bits of colored paper that he said were 
stamps they used before the 
Space Age, to prepay carrying 
charges on paper letters. He said 
no matter where he was, just one 
of those things could get him a 
fortune. Then he had some jewels, not rings or anything, just 
stones, and a fine story for every 
single one of them. 

"What you're holding in your 
hand," he said, "cost the life of 
a king and the loss of an empire 
half again as big as United 
Earth." And : "This one was once 
so well guarded that most people 
didn't know whether it existed or 
not. There was a whole religion 
based on it — and now it*s gone, 
and so is the religion." 

It gave you a queer feeling, 
being next to this man who had 
so much, and him just as warm 
and friendly as your favorite 
uncle. 

"If you can assure me these 



64 



GALAXY SC1ENCI FICTION 



bulkheads are soundproof, I'll 
show you something else I collect," he said. 

I assured him they were, and 
they were, too. "If ships' architects ever learned anything," I 
told him, "they learned that a 
man has just got to be by himself once in a while." 

He cocked his head to one 
side in that way he had. "How's 
that again?" 

"A man's just got to be by himself once in a while," I said. "So, 
mass or no, cost or no, a ship's 
bulkheads are built to give a man 
his privacy." 

"Good," he said. "Now let me 
show you." He unlocked a handcase and opened it, and from a 
little compartment inside he took 
out a thing about the size of the 
box a watch comes in. He handled it very gently as he put it 
down on his desk. It was square, 
and it had a fine grille on the top 
and two little silver studs on the 
side. He pressed one of them and 
turned to me, smiling. And let 
me tell you, I almost fell right 
off the bunk where I was sitting, 
because here was the Captain's 
voice as loud and as clear and 
natural as if he was right there 
in the room with us. And do 
you know what he said? 

He said, "My crew questions 
my sanity — yet you can be sure 
that if a single man aboard questions my authority, he will learn 



that I am master here, even if he 
must learn it at the point of a 
gun." 

"WJT7HAT surprised me so much 
" wasn't only the voice but 
the words — and what surprised 
me especially about the words 
was that I had heard the Skipper 
say them myself. It was the time 
he had had the argument with 
Mr. Costello. I remembered it 
well because I had walked into 
the dayroom just as the Captain 
started to yell. 

"Mr. Costello," he said in that 
big heavy voice of his, "in spite 
of your conviction that my crew 
questions my sanity . . " and all 
the rest of it, just like on this 
recording Mr. Costello had. And 
I remember he said, too, "even if 
he must learn it at the point of 
a gun. That, sir, applies to passengers — the crew has legal 
means of their own." 

I was going to mention this to 
Mr. Costello, but before I could 
open my mouth, he asked me, 
"Now tell me, Purser, is that the 
voice of the Captain of your 
ship?" 

And I said, "Well, if it isn't, 
I'm not the Purser here. Why, 
I heard him speak those words 
my very own self." 

Mr. Costello swatted me on 
the shoulder. "You have a good 
ear. Purser. And how do you like 
my little toy?" 



MR COSTELLO, HERO

Then he showed it to me, a 
little mechanism on the jeweled 
pin he wore on his tunic, a fine 
thread of wire to a pushbutton in 
his side pocket. 

"One of my favorite collections," he told me. "Voices. Anybody, anytime, anywhere." He 
took off the pin and slipped a 
tiny bead out of the setting. He 
slipped this into a groove in the 
box and pressed the stud. 

And I heard my own voice say, 
"I'm sorry you have to get off 
there, Mr. Costello. I'd like to see 
you some more." I laughed and 
laughed. That was one of the 
cleverest things I ever saw. And 
just think of my voice in his 
collection, along with the Captain and space only knows how 
many great and famous people! 

He even had the voice of the 
Third Officer, from just a few 
minutes before, saying, "A lunatic has taken over the bridge. 
Well, something has to be done 
about it." 

All in all, I had a wonderful 
visit with him, and then he asked 
me to do whatever I had to do 
about his clearance papers. So I 
went back to my office and got 
.them out. They are kept in the 
Purser's safe during a voyage. 
And I went through them with 
the okaysv There were a lot of 
them — he had more than most 
people. 

I found one from Earth Cen


tral that sort of made me mad. I 
guess it was a mistake. It was a 
Know All Ye that warned consular officials to report every six 
months, Earth time, on the activities of Mr. Costello. 

I took it to him, and it was a 
mistake, all right — he said, so 
himself. I tore it out of his passport book and adhesed an official 
note, reporting the accidental destruction of a used page of fully 
stamped visas. He gave me a 
beautiful blue gemstone for doing 
it. 

When I said, "I better not; I 
don't want you thinking I take 
bribes from passengers," he 
laughed and put one of those 
beads in his recorder, and it came 
out, in my voice, "I take bribes 
from passengers." He was a great 
joker. 

TF7E lay at Borinquen for four 
days. Nothing much happened except I was busy. That's 
what's tough about pursering. 
You got nothing to do for weeks 
in space, and then, when you're 
in spaceport, you have too much 
work to do even to go ashore 
much, unless it's a long layover. 

I never really minded much. 
I'm one of those mathematical 
geniuses, you know, even if I 
don't have too much sense otherwise, and I take pride in my work. 
Everybody has something he's 
good at, I guess. I couldn't tell 



66 




 



you how the gimmick works that 
makes the ship travel faster than 
light, but I'd hate to trust the 
Chief Engineer with one of my 
interplanetary cargo manifests, 
or a rate-of -exchange table, 
glunker pelts to U.E. dollars. 

Some hard - jawed character 
with Space Navy Investigator 
credentials came inboard with a 
portable voice recorder and made 
me and the Third Officer recite 
a lot of nonsense for some sort of 
test, I don't know what. The SNI 
is always doing a lot of useless 
and mysterious things. I had an 
argument with the Port Agent, 
and I went ashore with Cooky 
for a fast drink. The usual thing. 
Then I had to work overtime 
signing on a new Third — they 
transferred the old one to a corvette that was due in, they told 
me. 

Oh, yes, that was the trip the 
Skipper resigned. I guess it was 
high time. He'd been acting very 
nervous. He gave me the damnedest look when he went ashore 
that last time, like he didn't 
know whether to kill me or burst 
into tears. There was a rumor 
around that he'd gone beserk and 
threatened the crew with a gun, 
but I don't listen to rumors. And 
anyway, the Port Captain signs 
on new skippers. It didn't mean 
any extra work for me, so it 
didn't matter much. 

We upshipped again and made 

MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



the rounds, Bootes Sigma and 
Nightingale and Caranho and 
Earth — chemical glassware, 
blackprints, sho seed and glitter 
crystals ; perfume, music tape, 
glizzard skins and Aldebar — all 
the usual junk for all the usual 
months. And round we came 
again to Borinquen. 

Well, you wouldn't believe a 
place could change so much in 
so short a time. Borinquen used 
to be a pretty free-and-easy planet. There was just the one goodsized city, see, and then trapper 
camps all through the unsettled 
area. If you liked people, you 
settled in the city, and you could 
go to work in the processing 
plants or maintenance or some 
such. If you didn't, you could 
trap glunkers. There was always 
something for everybody on Borinquen. 

But things were way different 
this trip. First of all, a man 
with a Planetary Government 
badge came aboard, by God, to 
censor the music tapes consigned 
for the city, and he had the credentials for it, too. Next thing 
I find out. the municipal authorities have confiscated the warehouses — my warehouses — and 
they were being converted into 
barracks. 

And where were the goods — the 
pelts and ingots for export? 
Where was the space for our 
cargo? Why, in houses — in hun
67 



dreds of houses, all spread around 
every which way, all indexed up 
with a whole big new office full 
of conscripts and volunteers to 
mix up and keep mixed up! For 
the first time since" I went to 
space, I had to request layover 
so I could get things unwound. 

A NYWAY it gave me a chance 
to wander around the town, 
which I don't often get. 

You should have seen the 
place! Everybody seemed to be 
moving out of the houses. All the 
big buildings were being made 
over into hollow shells, filled 
with rows and rows of mattresses. 
There were banners strung across 
the streets: are you a man or 

ARE YOU ALONE? A SINGLE SHINGLE 
IS A SORRY SHELTER! THE DEVIL 
HATES A CROWD! 

All of which meant nothing to 
me. But it wasn't until I noticed 
a sign painted in whitewash on 
the glass front of a barroom, saying TRAPPERS STAY OUT? that I 

was aware of one of the biggest 
changes of all. 

There were no trappers on the 
streets — none at all. They used 
to be one of the tourist attractions of Borinquen, dressed in 
glunker fur, with the long tailwings afloat in the wind of their 
walking, and a kind of distance 
in their eyes that not even spacemen had. As soon as I missed 
them, I began to see the trappers 



stay out! signs just about everywhere—on the stores, the restaurants, the hotels and theaters. 

I stood on a street corner, 
looking around me and wondering what in hell was going on 
here, when a Borinquen cop yelled something at me from a monowheel prowl car. I didn't 
understand him, so I just shrugged. He made a U-turn and 
coasted up to me. 

"What's the matter, country 
boy? Lose your traps?" 

I said, "What?" 

He said, "If you want to go 
it alone, glunker, we got solitary 
cells over at the Hall that'll suit 
you fine." 

I just gawked at him. And, to 
my surprise, another cop poked 
his head up out of the prowler. 
A one-man prowler, mind. They 
were really jammed in there. 

This second one said, "Where's 
your trapline, jerker?" 

I said, "I don't have a trapline." I pointed to the mighty 
tower of my ship, looming over 
the spaceport. "I'm the Purser 
off that ship." 

"Oh, for God's sakes!" said the 
first cop. "I might have known. 
Look, Spacer, you'd better 
double up or you're liable to get 
yourself mobbed. This is no spot 
for a soloist." 

"I don't get you, Officer. I 
was just — " 

"I'M take him," said someone 



68 




 



I looked around and saw a tall 
Bonnqueria standing just inside 
the open doorway of one of the 
hundreds of empty houses. She 
said, "I came back here to pick 
up some of my things. When I 
got done in here, there was nobody on the sidewalks. I've been 
here an hour, waiting for somebody to go with." She sounded a 
little hysterical. 

"You know better than to go 
in there by yourself/' said one 
of the cops. 

"I know— I know. It was just 
to get my things. I wasn't going 
to stay." She hauled up a duffelbag and dangled it in front of her. 
"Just to get my things," she said 
again, frightened. 

The cops looked at each other. 
"Well, all right. But watch yourself. You go along with the Purser here. Better straighten him 
out — he don't seem to know 
what's right." 

"I will," she said thankfully. 

But by then the prowler had 
moaned off, weaving a little under its double load. 

T LOOKED at her She wasn't 
pretty. She was sort of heavy 
and stupid. 

She said, "You'll be all right 
now. Let's go." 

"Where?" 

"Well, . Central Barracks, I 
guess. That's where most everybody is." 



"I have to get back to the 
ship." 

"Oh, dear," she said, all distressed again. "Right away?" 

"No, not right away. I'll go 
in town with you, if you want." 
She picked up her duffetbag, but 
I took it from her and heaved 
it up on my shoulder. "Is everybody here crazy?" I asked her, 
scowling. 

"Crazy?" She began walking, 
and I went along. "I don't think 
so." 

"All this," I persisted. I pointed to a banner that said, no 

LADDER HAS A SINGLE RUNG. 

"What's that mean?" 

"Just what it says." 

"You have to put up a big 
thing like that just to tell me . . ." 

"Oh," she said. "You mean 
what does it mean.'" She looked 
at me strangely. "We've found 
out a new truth about humanity. 
Look, I'll try to tell it to you the 
way Lucilles said it last night." 

"Who's Lucille?" 

"The Lucilles," she said, in a 
mildly shocked tone. "Actually, 
I suppose there's really only one 
— though, of course, there'll be 
someone else in the studio at the 
time," she added quickly. "But 
on trideo it looks like four Lucilles, all speaking at once, sort 
of in chorus." 

"You just go on talking," I 
said when she paused. "I catch 
on slowly."

"Well, here's what they say. 
They say no one human being 
ever did anything. They say it 
takes a hundred pairs of hands 
to build a house, ten thousand 
pairs to build a ship." They say 
a single pair is not only useless — 
it's eVi7. All humanity is a thing 
made up of many parts. No part 
is good by itself. Any part that 
wants to go off by itself hurts the 
whole main thing — the thing that 
has become so great. So we're 
seeing to it that no part ever gets 
separated. What good would 
your hand be if a finger suddenly 
decided to go off by itself?" 

I said, "And you believe this — 
what's your name?" 

"Nola. Believe it? Well, it's 
true, isn't it? Can't you see it's 
true? Everybody knows it's true." 



"Well, it could be true," I said 
reluctantly. "What do you do 
with people who want to be by 
themselves?" 

"We help them." 

"Suppose they don't want 
help?" 

"Then they're trappers," she 
said immediately. "We push them 
back into the bush, where the 
evil soloists come from." 

"Well, what about the fur?" 

"iVobody uses furs any more!" 




70 




 



So that's what happened to our 
fur consignments ! And I was 
thinking those amateur red-tapers had just lost 'em somewhere, 

She said, as if to herself, "All 
sin starts in the lonesome dark," 
and when I looked up, I saw 
she'd read it approvingly off another banner. 

WE rounded a corner and I 
blinked at a blaze of light. 
It was one of the warehouses. 

"There's the Central," she said. 
"Would you like to see it?" 
"I guess so." 

I followed her down the street 
to the entrance. There was a man 
sitting at a table in the doorway. 
Nola gave him a card. He checked it against a list and handed it 
back. 



"A visitor," she said. "From 
the ship." 

I showed him my Purser's card 
and he said, "Okay. But if you 
want to stay, you'll have to register." 

"I won't want to stay," I told 
him. "I have to get back." 

I followed Nola inside. 

The place had been scraped 
out to the absolute maximum. 
Take away one splinter of vertical structure more and it 
wouldn't have held a roof. There 
wasn't a concealed corner, a shelf, 
a drape, an overhang. There must 
have been two thousand beds, 
cots and mattresses spread out, 
cheek by jowl, over the entire 
floor, in blocks of four, with only 
a hand's-breadth between them. 
The light was blinding — huge 




MR. COSTELLO, 



HERO 



floods and spots bathed every 
square inch in yellow-white fire. 

Nola said, "You'll get used to 
the light. After a few nights, you 
don't even notice it." 

"The lights never get turned 
off?" 

"Oh, dear, no!" 

Then I saw the plumbing — 
showers, tubs, sinks and everything else. It was all lined up 
against one wall. 

Nola followed my eyes. "You 
get used to that, too. Better to 
have everything out in the open 
than to let the devil in for one 
secret second. That's what the 
Lucilles say." 

I dropped her duffelbag and sat 
down on it. The only thing I 
could think of was, "Whose idea 
was all this? Where did it start?" 

"The Lucilles," she said vaguely. Then, "Before them, I don't 
know. People just started to realize. Somebody bought a warehouse—no, it was a hangar — I 
don't know," she said again, apparently trying hard to remember. She sat down next to me 
and said in a subdued voice, 
"Actually, some people didn't 
take to it so well at first," She 
looked around. "/ didn't. I mean 
it, I really didn't. But you believed, or you had to act as if 
you believed, and one way or 
another everybody just came to 
this." She waved a hand. 

"What happened to the ones 



who wouldn't come to Centrals?" 

"People made fun of them. 
They lost their jobs, the schools 
wouldn't take their children, the 
stores wouldn't honor their ration 
cards. Then the police started to 
pick up soloists — like they did 
you." She looked around again, 
a sort of contented familiarity 
in her gaze. "It didn't take long." 

I turned away from her, but 
found myself staring at all that 
plumbing again. I jumped up. 
"I have to go, Nola. Thanks for 
your help. Hey — how do I get 
back to the ship, if the cops are 
out to pick up any soloist they 
see?" 

"Oh, just tell the man at the 
gate. There'll be people waiting 
to go your way. There's always 
somebody waiting to go everywhere." 

SHE came along with me. I 
spoke to the man at the gate, 
and she shook hands with me. I 
stood by the little table and 
watched her hesitate, then step 
up to a woman who was entering. They went in together. The 
doorman nudged me over toward 
a group of what appeared to be 
loungers. 

"North!" he bawled. 
I drew a pudgy little man with 
bad teeth, who said not one single 
word. We escorted each other 
two-thirds of the way to the 
spaceport, and he disappeared 



72 




 



into a factory. I scuttled the rest 
of the way alone, feeling like a 
criminal, which I suppose I was. 
I swore I would never go into 
that crazy city again. 

And the next morning, who 
should come out for me, in an 
armored car with six two-man 
prowlers as escort, but Mr. Costello himself! 

It was pretty grand seeing him 
again. He was just like always, 
big and handsome and good-natured. He was not alone. All 
spread out in the back corner 
of the car was the most beautiful 
blonde woman that ever struck 
me speechless. She didn't say 
very much. She would just look 
at me every once in a while and 
sort of smile, and then she would 
look out of the car window and 
bite on her lower lip a little, and 
then look at Mr. Costello and 
not smile at all. 

Mr. Costello hadn't forgotten 
me. He had a bottle of that same 
red cinnamon wine, and he talked over old times the same as 
ever, like he was a special uncle. 
We got a sort of guided tour. I 
told him about last night, about 
the visit to the Central, and he 
was pleased as could be. He said 
he knew I'd like it. I didn't stop 
to think whether I liked it or not. 

"Think of it!" he said. "All 
humankind, a single unit. You 
know the principle of cooperation, Purser?" 



When I took too long to think 
it out, he said, "You know. Two 
men working together can produce more than two men working 
separately. Well, what happens 
when a thousand — a million — 
work, sleep, eat, think, breathe 
together?" The way he said it, 
it sounded fine. 

He looked out past my shoulder and his eyes widened just a 
little. He pressed a button and 
the chauffeur brought us to a 
sliding stop. 

"Get that one," Mr. Costello 
said into a microphone beside 
him. 

Two of the prowlers hurtled 
down the street and flanked a 
man. He dodged right, dodged 
left, and then a prowler hit him 
and knocked him down. 

"Poor chap," said Mr. Costello, 
pushing the Go button. "Some of 
'em just won't learn." 

I think he regretted it very 
much. I don't know if the blonde 
woman did. She didn't even look. 

"Are you the mayor?" I asked 
him. 

"Oh, no," he said. "I'm a sort 
of broker. A little of this, a little 
of that. I'm able to help out a 
bit." 

"Help out?" 

"Purser," he said confidentially, "I'm a citizen of Borinquen 
now. This is my adopted land 
and I love it. I mean to do everything in my power to help it. I 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



73 



don't care about the cost. This is 
a people that has found the truth, 
Purser. It awes me. It makes me 
humble." 

"Speak up, man. I'm your 
friend." 

"I appreciate that, Mr. Costello. Well, what I was going to 
say, I saw that Central and all. 
I just haven't made up my mind. 
I mean whether it's good or not." 

"Take your time, take your 
time," he said in the big soft 
voice. "Nobody has to make a 
man see a truth, am I right? A 
real truth? A man just sees it all 
by himseff." 

"Yeah," I agreed. "Yeah, I 
guess so." Sometimes it was hard 
to find an answer to give Mr. 
Costello. 

'¥^HE car pulled up beside a 
building. The blonde woman 
pulled herself together. Mr. Costello opened the door for her with 
his own hands. She got out. Mr. 
Costello rapped the trideo screen 
in front of him. 

He said, "Make it a real good 
one, Lucille, real good. I'll be 
watching." 

"She looked at him. She gave 
me a small smile. A man came 
down the steps and she went with 
him up into the building. 

We moved off. 

I said, "She's the prettiest woman I ever saw." 



He said, "She likes you fine, 
Purser." , 

I thought about that. It was 
too much. 

He asked, "How would you 
like to have her for your very 
own?" 

"Oh," I said, "she wouldn't." 

"Purser, I owe you a big favor. 
I'd like to pay it back." 

"You don't owe me a thing, 
Mr. Costello!" 

We drank some of the wine. 
The big car slid silently along. It 
went slowly now, headed back 
out to the spaceport. 

"I need some help," he said 
after a time. "I know you, Purser. You're just the kind of man 
I can use. They say you're a 
mathematical genius." 

"Not mathematics exactly, Mr. 
Costello. Just numbers — statistics — conversion tables and like 
that. I couldn't do astrogation or 
theoretical physics and such. I 
got the best job I could have 
right now." 

"No, you haven't. I'll be frank 
with you. I don't want any more 
responsibility on Borinquen than 
I've got, you understand, but the 
people are forcing it on me. They 
want order, peace and order — 
tidiness. They want to be as nice 
and tidy as one of your multiple 
manifests. Now I could organize 
them, all right, but I need a tidy 
brain like yours to keep them 
organized. I want full birth-and 



74 




 



death-rate statistics, and then I 
want them projected so we can 
get policy. I want calory-counts 
and rationing, so we can use the 
food supply the best way. I want 
— well, you see what I mean. Once 
the devil is routed — " 
"What devil?" 

"The trappers," he said grayly. 

"Are the trappers really harming the city people?" 

He looked at me, shocked. 
"They go out and spend weeks 
alone by themselves, with their 
own evil thoughts. They are wandering cells, wild cells in the body 
of humanity. They must be destroyed." 

¥ COULDN'T help but think 
of my consignments. "What 
about the fur trade, though?" 

He looked at me as if I had 
made a pretty grubby little mistake. "My dear Purser," he said 
patiently, "would you set the 
price of a few pelts above the 
immortal soul of a race?" 

I hadn't thought of it that way. 

He said urgently, "This is just 
the beginning. Purser. Borinquen 
is only a start. The unity of that 
great being. Humanity, will become known throughout the Universe." He closed his eyes. When 
he opened them, the organ tone 
was gone. He said in his old, 
friendly voice, "And you and I, 
we'll show 'em how to do it, hey, 
boy?" 



I leaned forward to look up to 
the top of the shining spire of the 
spaceship. "I sort of like the job 
I ' ve got. But — my contract is 
up four months from now . , ." 

The car turned into the spaceport and hummed across the slag 
area. 

"I think I 'can count on you," 
he said vibrantly. He laughed. 
"Remember this little joke, Purser?" 

He clicked a switch, and suddenly my own voice filled the 
tonneau. "/ fa/ce bribes from passengers." 

"Oh, that," I said, and let 
loose one ha of a ha-ha before I 
understood what he was driving 
at. "Mr. Costello, you wouldn't 
use that against me." 

"What do you take me for?" he 
demanded, in wonderment. 

Then we were at the ramp. He 
got out with me. He gave me his 
hand. It was warm and hearty. 

"If you change your mind 
about the Purser's job when your 
contract's up. son, just buzz me 
through the field phone. They'll 
connect me. Think it over until 
you get back here. Take your 
time." His hand clamped down 
on my biceps so hard I winced. 
"But you're not going to take 
any longer than that, are you, 
my boy?" 

"I guess not," I said. 

He got into the front, by the 
chauffeur, and zoomed away.

I stood looking after him and, 
when the car was just a dark 
spot on the slag area, I sort of 
came to myself. I was standing 
alone on the foot of the ramp. 
I felt very exposed. 

I turned and ran up to the airlock, hurrying, hurrying to get 
near people. 

rT^HAT was the trip \ye shipped 
the crazy man. His name was 
Hynes. He was United Earth 
Consul at Borinquen and he was 
going back to report. He was no 
trouble at first, because diplomatic passports are easy to process. He knocked on my door the 
fifth watch out from Borinquen. 
I was glad to see him. My room 
was making me uneasy and I appreciated his company. 

Not that he was really company. He was crazy. That first 
time, he came busting in and 
said, "I hope you don't mind, 
Purser, but if I don't talk to 
somebody about this, I'll go out 
of my mind." Then he sat down 
on the end of my bunk and put 
his head in his hands and rocked 
back and forth for a long time, 
without saying anything. Next 
thmg he said was, "Sorry," and 
out lie went. Crazy, I tell you. 

But he was back in again before long. And then you never 
heard such ravings. 

"Do you know what's happened to Borinquen?" he'd demand. 



But he didn't want any answers. 
He had the answers. "I'll tell 
you what's wrong with Borinquen — Borinquen's gone mad!" 
he'd say. 

I went on with my work, 
though there wasn't much of it 
in space, but that Hynes just 
couldn't get Borinquen out of his 
mind. 

He said, "You wouldn't believe 
it if you hadn't seen it done. 
First the little wedge, driven in 
the one place it might exist — between the urbans and the trappers. There was never any 
conflict between them — never! 
All of a sudden, the trapper was 
a menace. How it happened, why, 
God only knows. First, these 
laughable attempts to show that 
they were an unhealthy influence. 
Yes, laughable— how could you 
take it seriously? 

"And then the changes. You 
didn't have to prove that a trapper had done anything. You only 
had to prove he was a trapper. 
That was enough. And the next 
thing — how could you anticipate 
anything as mad as this?" — he 
almost screamed — "the next 
thing was to take anyone who 
wanted to be alone and lump 
him with the trappers. It all 
happened so fast — it happened 
in our sleep. And all of a sudden 
you were afraid to be alone in a 
room for a second. They left 
their homes. They built barracks. 



76 




 



Everyone afraid of everyone else, 
afraid, afraid . . . 

"Do you know what they did?" 
he roared. "They burned the 
paintings, every painting on Borinquen they could find that had 
been done by one artist. And the 
few artists who survived as artists — I've seen them. By twos and 
threes, they work together on the 
one canvas." 

He cried. He actually sat there 
and cried. 

He said, "There's food in the 
stores. The crops come in. Trucks 
run, planes fly, the schools are 
in session. Bellies get full, cars 
get washed, people get rich. I 
know a man called Costello, just 
in from Earth a few months, 
maybe a year or so, and already 
owns half the city." 

"Oh, I know Mr. Costello," I 
said. 

"Do you now! How's that?" 

I TOLD him about the trip out 
with Mr. Costello. He sort of 
backed off from me. "You're the 
one!" 

"The one what?" I asked in 
puzzlement. 

"Kou're the man who testified 
against your Captain, broke him, 
made him resign." 

"I did no such a thing." 

"I'm the Consul. It was my 
hearing, man! I was there.' A recording of the Captain's voice, 
admitting to insanity, declaring 



he'd take a gun to his crew if 
they overrode him. Then your recorded testimony that it was his 
voice, that you were present when 
he made the statement. And the 
Third Officer's recorded statement that all was not well on the 
bridge. The man denied it, but 
it was his voice." 

"Wait, wait," I said. "I don't 
believe it. That would need a 
trial. There was no trial. I wasn't 
called to any trial." 

"There would have been a 
trial, you idiot! But the Captain 
started raving about draw poker 
without a draw, about the crew 
fearing poisoning from the cook, 
about the men wanting witnesses 
even to change the bridge-watch. 
Maddest thing I ever heard. He 
realized it suddenly, the Captain 
did. He was old, sick, tired, beaten. He blamed the whole thing on 
Costello, and Costello said he got 
the recordings from you." 

"Mr. Costello wouldn't do such 
a thing!" I guess I got mad at 
Mr. Hynes then. I told him a 
whole lot about Mr. Costello, 
what a big man he was. He started to tell me how Mr. Costello 
was forced off the Triumverate 
for making trouble in the high 
court, but they were lies and I 
wouldn't listen. I told him about 
the poker, how Mr. Costello 
saved us from the cheaters, how 
he saved us from poisoning, how 
he made the ship safe for us all. 



MR. COSTELLO, HERO 



77 



I remember how he looked at 
me then. He sort of whispered, 
"What has happened to human 
beings? What have we done to 
ourselves with these centuries of 
peace, with confidence and cooperation and no conflict? Here's 
distrust by man for man, waiting 
under a thin skin to be punctured 
by just the right vampire, waiting 
to hate itself and kill itself all 
over again . . . 

"My Cod!" he suddenly 
screamed at me. "Do you know 
what I've been hanging onto? 
The idea that, for all its error, for 
all its stupidity, this One Humanity idea on Borinquen was a 
principle? I hated it, but because 
it was a principle, I could respect it. It's Costello — Costello, 
who doesn't gamble, but who 
uses fear to change the poker 
rules — Costello, who doesn't eat 
your food, but makes -you fear 
poison — Costello, who can see 
three hundred years of safe interstellar flight, but who through 
fear makes the watch officers 
doubt themselves without a witness — Costello, who runs things 
without being seen! 

"My God, Costello doesn't 
care! It isn't a principle at all. 
It's just Costello spreading fear 
anywhere, everywhere, to make 
himself strong!" 

He rushed out, crying with rage 
and hate. I have to admit I was 
sort of jolted. I guess I might 



even have thought about the 
things he said, only he killed 
himself before we reached Earth. 
He was crazy. 

YV/E made the rounds, same as 
™ ever, scheduled like an interurban line : Load, discharge, 
blastoff, fly and planetfall. Refuel, clearance, manifest. Eat, 
sleep, work. There was a hearing 
about Hynes. Mr. Costello sent 
a spacegram with his regrets 
when he heard the news. I didn't 
say anything at the hearing, just 
that Mr. Hynes was upset, that's 
all, and it was about as true as 
anything could be. We shipped a 
second engineer who played real 
good accordian. One of the inboard men got left on Caranho. 
All the usual things, except I 
wrote up my termination with 
no options, ready to file. 

So in its turn we made Borinquen again, and what do you 
know, there was the space fleet of 
United Earth. I never guessed 
they had that many ships. They 
sheered us off, real Navy : all 
orders and no information. Borinquen was buttoned up tight; 
there was some kind of fighting 
going on down there. We couldn't 
get or give a word of news 
through the quarantine. It made 
the skipper mad and he had to 
use part of the cargo for fuel, 
which messed up my records six 
ways from the middle. I stashed 



78 




 



my termination papers away for 
the time being. 

And in its turn, Sigma, where 
we lay over a couple of days to 
get back in the rut, and, same as 
always, Nightingale, right on 
schedule again. 

And who should be waiting for 
me at Nightingale but Barney 
Roteel, who was medic on my 
first ship, years back when I was 
fresh from the Academy. He had 
a pot belly now and looked real 
successful. We got the jollity out 
of the way and he settled down 
and looked me over, real sober. I 
said it's a small Universe — I'd 
known he had a big job on Nightingale, but imagine him showing 
up at the spaceport just when I 
blew in! 

"I showed up because you 
blew in, Purser," he answered. 

Then before I could take that 
apart, he started asking me questions. Like how was I doing, 
what did I plan to do. 

I said, "I've been a purser for 
years and years. What makes 
you think I want to do anything 
different?" 

"Just wondered." 

I wondered, too. "Well," I 
said, "I haven't exactly made up 
my mind, you might say — and a 
couple of things have got in the 
way — but I did have a kind of 
offer." I told him just in a general way about how big a man 
Mr. Costello was on Borinquen 



now, and how he wanted me to 
come in with him. "It'll have to 
wait, though. The whole damn 
Space Navy has a cordon around 
Borinquen. They wouldn't say 
why. But whatever it is, Mr. 
Costello'll come out on top. 
You'll see." 

Barney gave me a sort of puckered-up look. I never saw a man 
look so weird. Yes, I did, too. 
It was the old Iron Man, the 
day he got off the ship and resigned. 

"Barney, what's the matter?" 
I asked. 

He got up and pointed through 
the glass door-lights to a white 
monowheel that stood poised in 
front of the receiving station. 
"Come on," he said. 

"Aw, I can't. I got to — " 

"Come on/" 

I shrugged. Job or no, this was 
Barney's bailiwick, not mine. 
He'd cover me. 

He held the door open and 
said, like a mind reader, "I'll 
cover you." 

We went down the ramp and 
climbed in and skimmed off. 

"Where are we going?" 

But he wouldn't say. He just 
drove. 

TVTGHTINGALE'S a beautiful

no local options, but none. Ifs a 
regular garden of a world and 
they keep it that way. 

We topped a rise and went 
down a curving road lined with 
honest-to-God Lombardy poplars from Earth. There was a 
little lake down there and a 
sandy beach. No people. 

The road curved and there 
was a yellow line across it and 
then a red one, and after it a 
shimmering curtain, almost transparent. It extended from side to 
side as far as I could see. 

"Force-fence," Barney said and 
pressed a button on the dash. 

The shimmer disappeared from 
the road ahead, though it stayed 
where it was at each side. We 
drove through and it formed behind us, and we went down the 
hill to the lake. 

Just this side of the beach was 
the coziest little Sigma cabana 
I've seen yet, built to hug the 
slope and open its arms to the 
sky. Maybe when I get old they'll 
-turn me out to pasture in one 
half as good. 

While I was goggling at it, 
Barney" said, "Go on." 

I looked at him and he was 
pointing. There was a man down 
near the water, big, very tanned, 
built like a space-tug. Barney 
waved me on and I walked down 
there. ( 

The man got up and turned to 
me. He had the same wide-spac


ed, warm deep eyes, the same 
full, gentle voice. "Why, it's the 
Purser! Hi, old friend. So you 
came, after all!" 

It was sort of rough for a moment. Then I got it out. "Hi, 
Mr. Costello." 

He banged me on the shoulder. 
Then he wrapped one big hand 
around my left biceps and pulled 
me a little closer. He looked uphill to where Barney leaned 
against the monowheel, minding 
his own business. Then he looked 
across the lake, and up in the 
sky. 

He dropped his voice. "Purser, 
you're just the man I need. But 
I told you that before, didn't I?" 
He looked around again. "We'll 
do it yet, Purser. You and me, 
we'll hit the top. Come with me. 
I want to show you something." 

He walked ahead of me toward 
the beach margin. He was wearing only a breech-ribbon, but he 
moved and spoke as if he still 
had the armored car and the six 
prowlers. I stumbled after him. 

He put a hand behind him and 
checked me, and then knelt. He 
said, "To look at them, you'd 
think they were all the same, 
wouldn't you? Well, son, you just 
let me show you something." 

I looked down. He had an anthill. They weren't like Earth ants. 
These were bigger, slower, blue, 
and they had eight legs. They 
built nests of sand tied together

with mucus, and tunneled under 
them so that the nests stood up 
an inch or two like on little 
pillars. 

"They look the same, they act 
the same, but you'll see," said 
Mr. Costeilo. 

He opened a synthine pouch 
that lay in the sand. He took out 
a dead bird and the thorax of 
what looked like a Caranho 
roach, the one that grows as long 
as your forearm. He put the bird 
down here and the roach down 
yonder. 

"Now," he said, "watch." 



rpHE ants swarmed to the bird, 
pulling and crawling. Busy. 
But one or two went to the roach 
and tumbled it and burrowed 
around. Mr. Costeilo picked an 
ant off the roach and dropped it 
on the bird. It weaved around 
and shouldered through the 
others and scrabbled across the 
sand and went back to the roach. 

"You see, you see?" he said, 
enthusiastic. "Look." 

He picked an ant off the dead 
bird and dropped it by the roach. 
The ant wasted no time or even 
curiosity on the piece of roach.

It turned around once to get its 
bearings, and then went straight 
back to the dead bird. 

I looked at the bird with its 
clothing of crawling blue, and I 
looked at the roach with its two 
or three voracious scavengers. I 
looked at Mr. Costello. 

He said raptly, "See what I 
mean? About one in thirty eats 
something different. And that's 
all we need. I tell you, Purser, 
wherever you look, if you look 
long enough, you can find a way 
to make most of a group turn 
on the rest." 

I watched the ants. "They're 
not fighting." 

"Now wait a minute," he said 
swiftly. "Wait a minute. All we 
have to do is let these bird-eaters 
know that the roach-eaters are 
dangerous." 

"They're not dangerous," I 
said. "They're just different." 

"What's the difference, when 
you come right down to it? So 
we'll get the bird-eaters scared 
and they'll kill all the roach-eaters." ( 

"Yes, but why, Mr. Costello?" 

He laughed. "I like you, boy. 
I do the thinking, you do the 
work. I'll explain it to you. They 
all look alike. So once we've 
made 'em drive out these- — " he 
pointed to the minority around 
the roach — "they'll never know 
which among, 'em might be a 
roach-eater. They'll get so wor


ried, they'll do anything to keep 
from being suspected of roacheating. When they get scared 
enough, we can make 'em do 
anything we want." 

He hunkered down to watch 
the ants. He picked up a roacheater and put it on the bird. I 
got up. 

"Well, I only just dropped in, 
Mr. Costello," I said. 

"I'm not an ant," said Mr. 
Costello. "As long as it makes no 
difference to me what they eat, I 
can make 'em do anything in the 
world I want." 

"I'll see you around," I said. 

He kept on talking quietly to 
himself as I walked away. He 
was watching -the ants, figuring, 
and paid no attention to me. 

I went back to Barney, I 
asked, sort of choked, "What is 
he doing, Barney?" 

"He's doing what he has to 
do," Barney said. 

1W/E went back to the mono*" wheel and up the hill and 
through the force-gate. After a 
while, I asked, "How long will 
he be here?" 

"As long as he wants to be." 
Barney was kind of short about 
it. 

"Nobody wants to be locked 
up." 

He had that odd look on his 
face again. "Nightingale's not a 
jail."

"He can't get out." 

"Look, chum, we could start 
him over. We could even make 
a purser out of him. But we stopped doing that kind of thing a 
long time ago. We let a man do 
what he wants to do." 

"He never wanted to be boss 
over an anthill." 

"He didn't?" 

I guess I looked as if I didn't 
understand that, so he said, "All 
his life he's pretended he's a 
man and the rest of us are ants. 
Now it's come true for him. He 
won't run human anthills any 
more because he will never again 
get near one." 

I looked through the windshield at the shining finger that 
was my distant ship. "What happened on Borinquen , Barney ?" 

"Some of his converts got loose 
around the System. That Humanity One idea had to be stopped." He drove a while, seeing 
badly out of a thinking face. 
"You won't take this hard, Purser, but you're a thick-witted 
ape. I can say that if no one else 
can." 

'All right," I said. "Why?" 

"We had to smash into Borinquen, which used to be so free 
and easy. We got into Costello's 
place. It was a regular fort. We 
got him and his files. We didn't 
get his girl. He killed her, but 
the files were enough." 

After a time I said, "He was 



always a good friend to me." 
"Was he?" 

I didn't say anything. He 
wheeled up to the receiving station and stopped the machine. 

He said, "He was all ready for 
you if you came to work for 
him. He had a voice recording of 
you large as life, saying 'Sometimes a man's just got to be by 
himself.' Once you went to work 
for him, all he needed to do to 
keep you in line was to threaten 
to put that on the air." 

I opened the door. "What did 
you have to show him to me for?" 

"Because we believe in letting 
a man do what he wants to do, as 
long as he doesn't hurt the rest 
of us. If you want to go back to 
the lake and work for Costello. 
for instance, I'll take you there." 

I closed the door carefully and 
went up the ramp to the ship. 

I did my work and when the 
time came, we blasted off. I was 
mad. I don't think it was about 
anything Barney told me. I 
wasn't especially mad about Mr. 
Costello or what happened to 
him, because Barney's the best 
Navy psych doc there is and 
Nightingale's the most beautiful 
hospital planet in the Universe. 

What made me mad was the 
thought that never again would 
a man as big as Mr. Costello give 
that big, warm, soft, strong 
friendship to a lunkhead like me.
