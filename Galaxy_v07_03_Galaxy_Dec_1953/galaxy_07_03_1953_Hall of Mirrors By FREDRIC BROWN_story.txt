Hall of Mirrors By FREDRIC BROWN 

FOR an instant you think, 
it is temporary blindness, 
this sudden dark that 
comes in the middle of a bright 
afternoon. 

It muse be blindness, you 
think ; could the sun that was 
tanning you have gone out instantaneously, leaving you in utter blackness? 

Then the nerves of your body 
tell you that you are standing, 
whereas only a second ago you 
were sitting comfortably, almost 
reclining, in a canvas chair. In 
the patio of a friend's house in 
Beverly Hills. Talking to Barbara, your fiancee. Looking at 

Barbara — Barbara in a swim suit 
— her skin golden tan in the brilliant sunshine, beautiful. 

You wore swimming trunks. 
Now you do not feel them on 
you; the slight pressure of the 
elastic waistband is no longer 
there against your waist. You 
touch your hands to your hips. 
You are naked. And standing. 

Whatever has happened to you 
is more than a change to sudden 
darkness or to sudden blindness. 

You raise your hands gropingly before you. They touch a plain 
smooth surface, a wall. You 
spread them apart and each hand 
reaches a corner. You pivot slowly. A second wall, then a third, 
then a door. You are in a closet

about four feet square. 

Your hand finds the knob of 
the door. It turns and you push 
the door open. 

There is light now. The door 
has opened to a lighted room . , . 
a room that you have never seen 
before. 

TT is not large, but it is plea■■■ santly furnished — - although 
the furniture is of a style that is 
strange to you. Modesty makes 
you open the door cautiously the 
rest of the way. But the room is 
empty of people. 

You step into the room, turning to look behind you into the 
closet, which is now illuminated 
by light from the room. The closet is and is not a closet; it is the 
size and shape of one, but it 
contains nothing, not a single 
hook, no rod for hanging clothes, 
no shelf. It is an empty, blankwalled, four-by-four foot space. 

You close the door to it and 
stand looking around the room. 
It is about twelve by sixteen feet. 
There is one door, but it is closed. 
There are no windows. Five 
pieces of furniture. Four of them 
you recognize — more or less. One 
looks like a very functional desk. 
One is obviously a chair ... a 
comfortable-looking one. There 
is a table, although its top is on 
several levels instead of only one. 
Another is a bed, or couch. 
Something shimmering is' lying 



across it and you walk over and 
pick the shimmering something 
up and examine it. It is a garment. 

You are naked, so you put it 
on. Slippers are part way under 
the bed (or couch) and you slide 
your feet into them. They fit, 
and they feel warm and comfortable as nothing you have ever 
worn on your feet has felt. Like 
lamb's wool, but softer. 

You are dressed now. You 
look at the door — the only door 
of the room except that of the 
closet (closet?) from which you 
entered it. You walk to the door 
and before you try the knob, you 
see the small typewritten sign 
pasted just above it that reads: 

This door has a time lock set to 
open in one hour. For reasons you 
will soon understand, it is better 
that you do not leave this room before then. There is a letter for you 
on the desk. Please read it. 

It is not signed. You look at 
the desk and see that there is 
an envelope lying on it. 

You do not yet go to take that 
envelope from the desk and read 
the letter that must be in it. 

Why not? Because you are 
frightened. 

You see other things about the 
room. The lighting has no source 
that you can discover. It comes 
from nowhere. It is not indirect 
lighting; the ceiling and the walls 



HALL OF MIRRORS 



arc not reflecting it at all. 

They didn't have lighting like 
that, back where you came from. 
What did you mean by back 
where you came from? 

You close your eyes. You tell 
yourself: J am Norman Hastings, 
I am an associate professor of 
mathematics at the University of 
Southern California. I am twenty-five years old, and this is the 
year nineteen hundred and fiftyfour. 

You open your eyes and look 
again. 

rpHEY didn't use that "style of 
* furniture in Los Angeles — or 
anywhere else that you know of 
— in 1954. That thing over in the 
corner — you can't even guess 
what it is. So might your grandfather, at your age, have looked 
at a television set. 

You look down at yourself, at 
the shimmering garment that 
you found waiting for you. With 
thumb and forefinger you feel its 
texture. 

It's like nothing you've ever 
touched before. 

/ am Norman Hastings. This 
is nineteen hundred and fifty four. 

Suddenly you must know, and 
at once. 

You go to the desk and pick 
up the envelope that lies upon it. 
Your name is typed on the out 
side. Norman Hasting*-. 



Your hands shake a little as 
you open it. Do you blame them? 

There are several pages, typewritten. Dear Norman, it starts. 
You turn quickly to the end to 
look for the signature. It is unsigned. 

You turn back and start reading. 

"Do not be afraid. There is 
nothing to fear, but much to explain. Much that you must understand before the time lock 
opens that door. Much that you 
must accept and — obey. 

"You have already, guessed 
that you are in the future — in 
what, to you, seems to be the 
future. The clothes and the room 
must have told you that. I planned it that way so the shock 
would not be too sudden, so you 
would realize it over the course 
of several minutes rather than 
read it here — and quite probably 
disbelieve what you read. 

"The 'closet' from which you 
have just stepped is, as you have 
by now realized, a time machine. 
From it you stepped into the 
world of 2004. The date is April 
7th, just fifty years from the time 
you last remember. 

"You cannot return. 

"I did this to you and you may 
hate me for it; I do not know. 
That is up to you to decide, but 
it does not matter. What does 
matter, and not to you alone, is 
another decision which you must 



HALL OF MIRRORS

make. I am incapable of making 
it. 

"Who is writing this to you? I 
would rather not tell you just 
yet. By the time you have finished reading this, even though it is 
not signed (for I knew you would 
look first for a signature), I will 
not need to tell you who I am. 
You will know. 

*'I am seventy-five years of 
age. I have, in this year 2004, 
been studying 'time 1 for thirty 
of those years. I have completed 
the first time machine ever built 
— and thus far, its construction, 
even the fact that it has beenconstructed, is my own secret. 

"You have just participated in 
the first major experiment. It 
will be your responsibility to decide whether there shall ever be 
any more experiments with it, 
whether it should be given to the 
world, or whether it should be 
destroyed and never used again." 

END of- the first page. You 
look up for a moment, hesitating to turn the next page. Already you suspect what is coming. 

You turn the page. 

'*! constructed the first time 
machine a week ago. My calculations had told me that it would 
work, but not how it would work. 
I had expected it to send an ob- * 
ject back in time — it works backward in time only, not forward — 



physically unchanged and intact. 

"My first experiment showed 
me my error. I placed a cube of 
metal in the machine — it was a 
miniature of the one you just 
walked out of— and set the machine to go backward ten years. I 
flicked the switch and opened 
the door, expecting to find the 
cube vanished. Instead I found it 
had crumbled to powder. 

"I put in another cube and sent 
it two years back. The second 
cube came back unchanged, except that it was newer, shinier, 

"That gave me the answer. I 
had been expecting the cubes to 
go back in time, and they had 
done so, but not in the sense I 
had expected them to. Those 
metal cubes had been fabricated 
about three years previously. I 
had sent the first one back years 
before it had existed in its fabricated form. Ten years ago it had 
been ore. The machine returned it 
to that state. 

"Do you see how our previous 
theories of time travel have been 
wrong? We expected to be able 
to step into a time machine in, 
say, 2004, set it for fifty years 
back, and then step out in the 
year 1954 . . . but it does not 
work that way. The machine 
does not move in time. Only 
whatever is within the machine 
is affected, and then just with 
relation to itself and not to the 
rest of the Universe.

"I confirmed this with guinea 
pigs by sending one six weeks 
old five weeks back and it came 
out a baby. 

"I need not outline all my experiments here. You will find, a 
record of them in the desk and 
you can study it later. 

"Do you understand now what 
has happened to you, Norman?" 

"VT'OU begin to understand. And 
you begin to sweat. 

The / who wrote that letter 
you are now reading is you, 
yourself at the age of seventyfive, in this year of 2004. You 
are that seventy-five-year-old 
man, with your body returned to 
what it had been fifty years ago, 
with all the memories of fifty 
years of "living wiped out. 

You invented the time machine. 

And before you used it on 
yourself, you made these arrangements to help you orient yourself. You wrote yourself the letter 
which you are now reading. 

But if those fifty years are — to 
you — gone, what of all your 
friends, those you loved? What 
of your parents? What of the girl 
you are going — were going — to 
marry? 

You read on: 

"Yes, you will want to know 
what has happened. Mom died in 
1963, Dad in 1968. You married 
Barbara in 1956. I am sorry to 



tell you that she died only three 
years later, in a plane crash. You 
have one son. He is still living; 
his name is Walter; he is now 
forty-six years old and is an accountant in Kansas City." 

Tears come into your eyes and 
for .a moment you can no longer 
read. Barbara dead — dead for 
forty-five years. And only minutes ago, in subjective time, you 
were sitting next to her, sitting 
in the bright sun in a Beverly 
Hills patio . . . 

You force yourself to read 
again. 

"But back to the discovery. 
You begin to see some of its 
implications. You will need time 
to think to see all of them. 

"It does not permit time travel 
as we have thought of time travel, but it gives us immortality of 
a sort. Immortality of the kind 
I have temporarily given us. 

"Is it good? Is it worth while to 
lose the memory of fifty years of 
one's life in order to return one's 
body to relative youth? The only 
way I can find out is to try, as 
soon as I have finished writing 
this and made my other preparations. 

"You will know the answer. 

"But before you decide, remember that there is another 
problem, more important than 
the psychological one. I mean 
overpopulation. 

"If our discovery is given to 



HALL OF MIRRORS 



93 



the world, if all who are old or 
dying can make themselves 
young again, the population will 
almost double every generation. 
Nor would the world — not even 
our own relatively enlightened 
country — be willing to accept 
compulsory birth control as a 
solution. 

"Give this to the world, as the 
world is today in 2004, and within a generation there will be famine, suffering, war. Perhaps a 
complete collapse of civilization. 

"Yes, we have reached other 
planets, but they are not suitable 
for colonizing. The stars may 
be our answer, but we are a long 
way from reaching them. When 
we do, someday, the billions of 
habitable planets that must be 
out there will be our answer . . . 
our living room. But until then, 
what is the answer? 

"Destroy the machine? But 
think of the countless lives it can 
save, the suffering it can prevent. Think of what it would 
mean to a man dying of cancer. 
Think . . 




IH1NK. You finish the letter 
and put it down. 



You think of Barbara dead for 
forty-five years. And of the fact 
that you were married to her for 
three years and that those years 
are lost to you. 

Ffty years lost. You damn the 
old man of seventy -five whom 



you became and who has done 
this to you . . . who has given you 
this decision to make. 

Bitterly, you know what the 
decision must be. You think that 
he knew, too, and realize that he 
could safely leave it in your 
hands. Damn him, he should 
have known. 

Too valuable to destroy, too 
dangerous to give. 

The other answer is painfully 
obvious. 

You must be custodian of this 
discovery and keep it secret until 
it is safe to give, until mankind 
has expanded to the stars and 
has new worlds to populate, or 
until, even without that, he has 
reached a state of civilization 
where he can avoid overpopulation by rationing births to the 
number of accidental — or voluntary — deaths. 

If neither of those things has 
happened in another fifty years 
(and are they likely so soon?), 
then you, at seventy-five, will be 
writing another letter like this 
one. You will be undergoing another experience similar to the 
one you're going through now. 
And making the same decision, 
of course. 

Why not? You'll be the same 
person again. 

Time and again , to preserve 
this secret until Man is ready for 
it. 

How often will you again sit 



94 



GALAXY SCIf NCE FICTION 



at a desk like this one, thinking 
the thoughts you are thinking 
now, feeling the grief you now 
feel? 

There is a click at the door and 
you know that the time lock has 
opened, that you are now free 
to leave this room, free to start 
a new life for yourself in place of 
the one you have already lived 
and lost. 



But you are in no hurry now to 
walk directly through that door. 

You sit there, staring straight 
ahead of you blindly, seeing in 
your mind's eye the vista of a set 
of facing mirrors, like those in 
an old-fashioned barber shop, reflecting the same thing over and 
over again, diminishing into far 
distance.
