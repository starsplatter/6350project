"TELL him," said Commander Lowndes' voice, 
speaking from the great 
exploration ship stationed on the 
other side of the world, "that 
we're recording it officially as 
Hulman's Planet. I think that 
might please him." 

Marder hesitated with his reply. Through the viewport of the 
parked little scout flier, he looked 
out at the vast, shadowy valley 
before him, at green and scarlet 
swamps, at gleaming dark waters 
threaded through them. A huge, 
blue-wooded wave of mountains 
rose beyond, the setting sun just 
touching their crest. In a quarter 
of an hour, it would be completely dark. His glance turned, 
almost reluctantly, to the substantial but incongruous reality of 
Hulman's house nearby, its upper 
story and roof mirrored in the 
tiny swamp lake. 

"No, it wouldn't please him," 
he said. "Boyce suggested it during our first visit with Hulman 
today. He wants us to record it 
instead as — I'll spell it — C-r-e-sg-y-t-h. Cresgyth. That's his 
phonetic interpretation of the 



name given it by the people here." 

"Fair enough," Commander 
Lowndes agreed, "if that's how 
he wants it." He inquired whether 
Marder had anything to add to 
the present report. 

"Not now," Marder said. "I'll 
call you back after we've met 
his woman." 

"T¥IS wife," Lowndes corrected 
him carefully. "I'm glad it 
happened to be you and Boyce 
who found Hulman. You're reliable men; you in particular, 
Marder. I don't need to emphasize that Hulman's chance discovery of what appears to be the 
first genuine human race ever 
encountered outside of Earth is 
of primary importance . . ." He 
continued to emphasize that obvious fact at some length. "Boyce 
might be inclined to hurry 
through the — ah, diplomatic 
overtures," he concluded. "You'll 
be careful about that part of it, 
Marder?" 

"Very careful," Marder promised. 

"On the two continents we've 
scanned so far, we've found no

traces of human inhabitants, present or past. It's possible that 
Hulman's acquaintances are the 
sole survivors of humanity here. 
If we frighten the tribe into hiding, there may never be another 
contact — and within a hundred 
years or less, they may have become extinct." 

"I understand." 

"Fine. Now, then — what about 
these other creatures? What did 
Hulman have to say about 
them?" 

"In the twenty years he's been 
marooned in this valley, he's had 
only three or four actual encounters with them — rather violent encounters, on his side. 
Apparently, they learned to avoid 
him after that. He seems," Marder added thoughtfully, "to have 
an almost psychopathic hatred 
for them." 

"Not very surprising!" 
Lowndes' tone was reproving, reminding Marder that Hulman 
had been, for the past forty years, 
one of the great, legendary names 
of stellar exploration. "Deems' 
scout reports it bagged a couple 
of specimens a few hours ago and 
is bringing them in. The description checks with what Hulman 
gave you — a wormlike, blue body 
with a set of arms, legs, and a 
head. Out of water, they appear 
to wear some kind of clothes, 
presumably to conserve body 
moisture." 



Marder agreed that it checked. 

"We've found them remarkably elusive otherwise," Lowndes 
went on. "There seems to have 
been a widespread rudimentary 
civilization along the seas and 
major lake coasts — amphibious 
cave-builders is what they were 
originally. But all the caves we 
examined have been deserted for 
centuries, at least, which indicates 
major migratory movements of 
the species inland. The seas and 
lakes are almost completely barren of life above the plankton 
level." 

There had been, according to 
Hulman, some kind of planetary 
catastrophe, Marder said. Hunger 
had driven the "snakes," as he 
called them, out of the great lake 
chains of their origin, up into 
the valley swamp lands and along 
the river courses, forcing the 
remnants of the mysterious human race ahead of them in their 
slow migration and gradually reducing the human living area . 
Hulman had killed six of the 
bluish, wormlike creatures in this 
section of the valley, in the first 
few years after he had crashed on 
the planet; after that, they had 
ceased to show up here. But, until 
now, he had been unable to give 
the humans more effective help. 

A FTER Lowndes cut contact, 
Marder remained sitting in 
the scout for a time, gazing out at 



52 




 



the vast, darkening valley with 
troubled, puzzled eyes. For twenty-two years after the destruction 
of his ship, Hulman had lived 
here, separated from the humanity of his origin by an enormity of 
light-years, by the black abyss of 
space, but in the company of a 
woman who was of an alien, 
dying race. 

"My wife!" Hulman had said, 
not defiantly but proudly, in 
speaking of her. "I called her 
Celia from the start, and she 
liked the name," 

Hidden somewhere in the shadowed swamps, the woman he'd 
called Celia was watching Hulman's great log house until she 
could overcome her timidity of 
the visitors from space. 

"She'll show up some time during the night," Hulman had 
laughed. "I'm leaving the doors 
open for her. I'll talk to her a 
little first, to reassure her, and 
you can meet her then. Meanwhile, why don't you have a look 
at her picture." 

Years ago, as a boy, Marder 
had first seen Hulman's early 
paintings of the outer worlds and, 
like countless thousands of others 
before and since, he had felt his 
imagination swell and grow wide 
with the cosmic grandeur of Hulman's vision of universal life. 

In the fifty or so paintings he 
had seen in the log house that 
day, the great sweep of space had 



dwindled to something apparently much more commonplace. 
Hulman's imagination seemed to 
have shrunk to correspond to the 
physical limitations of the valley that confined him. However, 
he had retained a characteristic 
and extraordinary precision of 
lifelike detail, particularly in regard to the human beings he had 
found here. 

They were beautiful creatures; 
but the paintings aroused a revulsion in Marder, in which he 
recognized a vague flavoring of 
terror. In the one painting Hulman showed them of the woman 
Celia, that effect was particularly 
pronounced. Marder found it difficult to explain to himself. Boyce 
seemed insensitive to it, and there 
was nothing in Hulman's words 
or attitude to provide additional 
clues. 

Re-entering the house, Marder 
glanced back with more than a 
trace of uneasiness at the swamp 
from the doors Hulman had left 
open. After twenty years, Hulman should know whether danger 
threatened him from there; but 
for a visitor on a strange world, 
"it" and "they" were always 
present in the unknown dark outside — fears that usually were 
imaginary, but sometimes were 
not. 

Marder smiled a little grimly 
at his own present apprehensions 
and went in.

HE found Hulman and Boyce 
in a cavernous cellar level 
beneath the house itself. It was 
well lit and showed familiar and 
reassuring features; power plants, 
storage rooms, even a hydroponic 
garden. The two men stood beside 
the opening of a deep fresh-water 
well, twenty feet across, which 
took up the left side of the main 
cellar hall. 

"Sixty feet down, it's ten degrees Fahrenheit," Hulman was 
stating, with a disarming houseowner's pride. He was a big man, 
rather heavy now, with a squarecut brown beard that showed only 
a few traces of gray. "I got the 
idea from Celia's people. Swamp 
water's none too healthy here at 
various seasons, but the well taps 
an underground river that's as 
pure as you could wish — " He 
caught sight of Marder. "Any 
news?" His face had become suddenly anxious. 

"They're going to wait over 
there with the ship," Marder 
said, "a week or more, if required. 
We're to follow your judgment 
in every way in establishing contact with the Cresgythians." 

"Good!" Hulman was obviously relieved. "We can't do anything till Celia comes in — and 
we'll have to be very tactful then. 
But I'm sure it won't take a 
week." 

"What makes them so shy of 
us?" Boyce inquired. 



A shadow passed over Hulman's face. "It's not you," he 
said. "It's me ... Or it's an impression I gave them of the Earth 
kind of human beings." 

Back upstairs, with the three 
of them settled comfortably in 
the big living room, he explained. 
He'd given Boyce and Marder a 
room together on the top floor of 
the house, across a small hall 
from his own room and that of 
his wife. 

"I've never asked Celia much 
about her people," he said. 
"There's some kind of very strong 
taboo that keeps her from talking 
about them. When I tried to press 
her for details at first, it was almost as if I were committing some 
sort of gross indecency. But I do 
know they hate violence, insanity 
— anything unbeautiful! And, you 
see . . ." 

When his ship crashed into the 
valley, he was the only man left 
alive on her out of the original 
crew of four. "Banning went insane two days before that and 
killed Nichols and Dawson," he 
said, his face drawn and taut, remembering it again over a period 
of twenty-two years. He paused. 
"And so I killed Banning before 
he could wreck the ship completely." He looked from one to 
the other of them. "Jt was unavoidable. But they never understood that, these people of Celia's." 




 



"How did they find out?" Marder stirred uncomfortably. 

Hulman shrugged. "I was unconscious for about a month and 
completely blind for six months 
afterward. They got me out of 
the wreck and nursed me back to 
life, but as soon as I was out of 
danger, only Celia would stay 
with me. She and I were alone 
for weeks before I regained my 
sight. How did they find out? 
They're sensitive in a number of 
ways. And there were those bodies 
in the ship. They — withdrew from 
me," he said with a grimace, "as 
soon as I no longer needed their 
help." 

"Then in all this time," Marder 
said slowly, "you never were 
able to gain their confidence?" 

Hulman stared at him a moment, apparently weighing the 
words. "It's not a question of confidence," he said finally. "It's a 
question of — well, I'm trying to 
tell you! I didn't mind being 
alone with Celia." He grinned 
suddenly, almost boyishly. "The 
others stayed in a small lake village they had a couple of miles 
up the valley, across the swamps. 
Celia went up there every few 
days, but she never brought anyone back with her. I suspected it 
was simply because I was an 
alien. I thought they'd get over 
that in time. Celia seemed happy 
enough, so it wasn't a very acute 
problem — " 



He paused a few seconds, 
frowning. "One day, when she'd 
slipped away again, I remembered a pair of field glasses I'd taken 
off the ship, and I got them and 
trained them on the village. That 
was a very curious experience — 
I never have found a complete 
explanation for it. For just one 
instant, I had everything in the 
clearest possible focus. There 
were children playing on the platforms above the water ; a few 
adults standing in the doorway of 
a house. And, suddenly, everything blurred!" Hulman gave a 
short hacking laugh. "Can you 
imagine that? They didn't want 
me to look at them, so they just 
blurred my vision!" 

"Eh?" Boyce was frowning. 

Marder sat still, startled, feeling the uneasiness growing up in 
him again. 

Hulman smiled crookedly. 
"That's all I can tell you. The 
glasses had a four-mile range and 
they were functioning perfectly, 
but the instant I turned them on 
the village, the field blurred. I'd 
never felt so wholeheartedly — and 
successfully — snubbed before." 

TJOYCE laughed uncomfortably and glanced at Marder. 
He was still more than a little in 
awe of Hulman, of the shining 
legend miraculously resurrected 
from the black tomb of space; 
but he, too, Marder decided, had 



CARETAKER 



55 



the vague sense of something disturbing and out of order here. 
Well, so much the better. There 
would be two of them to look out 
for trouble, if trouble came. 

"1*11 admit the trick annoyed 
me," Hulman said, "as soon as 
I'd got over my first surprise at 
it. Next day, I announced to 
Celia that I was going over to the 
village. She made no objection, 
but she followed me at a distance 
— probably to make sure I didn't 
drown on the way. It's wet going 
around here. At last I came over 
a rise and found myself a hundred yards from the village, on 
the land side. Almost immediately, I realized they had abandoned 
it. I walked around it a while and 
found cooking fires still glowing; 
but nobody had waited to receive 
me. So I went home, insulted 
and very sulky — I wouldn't even 
talk to Celia until the next morning!" 

He laughed. "I got over that in 
a hurry. And then I settled down 
to building us a house of our 
own, much bigger and better than 
anything they had in the village; 
and. that took up all my time for 
several months. For that whole 
period, I ignored our neighbors 
quite as thoroughly as they had 
ignored me." 

He grinned at his guests a little 
shamefacedly. "But you know, 
I couldn't keep it up then'. There 
was something so curiously hap


py and peaceful about them, even 
if they were giving me the cold 
shoulder. And the one good look 
I'd had of them had showed me 
they were physically the most 
beautiful people I'd ever seen. 
One day, when Celia was gone, I 
made another trip to the village — 
with exactly the same results as 
the first one. So I decided to look 
around for a less exclusive neighborhood. 

"I'd got the little flier of my 
ship repaired enough to take it 
off the ground and set it down 
again; and I calculated I'd salvaged enough fuel for at least 
one twenty-four-hour trip. Celia 
watched me take off. I flew high 
over the village and could see 
them down there, ignoring me as 
usual. Then I flew down the valley for almost fifty miles before 
I came across the first colony of 
the other ones — the snakes!" 

TIMARDER remembered something Lowndes had said. 
"Do the snakes live in caves?" 

"No!" Hulman said distastefully. "That* s what fooled me. It 
was a village of stake houses set 
into the head of a little lake, almost like the one here. I set down 
on the lake, coasted up to the 
village, climbed up a ladder, and 
saw themt" 

He shuddered. "They just stood 
there, very quietly, watching me 
from the doors and windows. 



56 




 



What made it worse somehow was 
that they wore clothes — but the 
clothes didn't cover enough. 
Those weaving, soft, blue bodies 
and staring eyes! I backed off 
down the ladder, with my gun 
ready, in case they rushed me; 
but they never moved . . ." 

He had found eight more colonies of the snakes farther down 
the valley, but no trace of another 
tribe of his beautiful humanoids. 
He flew up the valley then, high 
up into the mountains, almost exhausting his fuel; and beside a 
glacier-fed mountain lake was a 
tiny stake village, built into the 
water. And they were snakes 
again. 

"At the time, I didn't know 
just what to make of it. There 
was the possibility that my village represented an advance 
troop of human beings into a land 
of snakes. But I suspected— I felt 
— even then, that it was the other 
way around; that it was the 
snakes that were encroaching on 
the humans. So I swore to myself 
that as long as I lived, at least, 
human beings were going to hold 
this section of the valley undisturbed "and in safety. 

"When I came back, I said to 
Celia — she was standing at the 
same spot I'd seen her last, as if 
she'd never left it — 'Celia, I must 
speak to your people. Go tell 
them I will come again tomorrow 
and that they must not run 

CARETAKER 



away.' She looked at me silently 
for a long time, and then she 
turned and left in the direction 
of the village. She came back 
late at night and crept into my 
arms and said, 'They have promised to wait for you.' 

"I set out next morning, full 
of great plans. The snakes lived 
in widely scattered settlements, 
after all. The villagers and I 
could wipe out those settlements 
one by one, until we'd cleared the 
land about us ! That was the natural solution, wasn't it? I didn't 
realize then how diff erent, in 
some ways, Celia's people were 
from us!" 

DOYCE asked uneasily, "What 
happened?" 

"What happened?" Hulman repeated. "Well, I came over that 
rise, and there the village was. 
This time I knew they'd stayed 
at home! Then, not twenty feet 
off my path, I saw two of the 
snakes standing in the bushes, 
one watching me, the other looking at the village. Each had a 
kind of chunky crossbow across 
his shoulders; and they couldn't 
be seen from the village . . ." 

He paused and shook his head. 
"So I shot them both down, before they got over their surprise. 
That was all." He looked from 
one to the other again. "It was 
the natural thing to .do, wasn't 
it?" 

57 



Boyce nodded uncertainly. 
Marder said nothing. 

Hulman leaned forward. "But 
apparently, from the point of 
vieyf of the villagers, it wasn't! 
Because when I was done with 
the snakes— one of them took 
three shots before it would lie 
still — the village was empty 
again. When I got back home, 
I was actually sick with disappointment. And then I discovered 
that Celia was gone! 

"That was a bad three days. 
But she came back then. And on 
the morning she came back, I 
discovered they'd broken up the 
village overnight and moved on. 
I think they're not more than ten 
or twenty miles distant from 
here, but I never tried to look 
them up again." 

Boyce said puzzled, "But I 
don't see — " 

"Neither did I," Hulman interrupted,, "until it was too late!" 
He gave his short bark of laughter again; there was, Marder realized, a sort of suppressed fury 
in it. "They won't kill their enemies — they're too polite for that! 
So their enemies are gradually 
squeezing them out of existence." 

The three men studied each 
other in silence for a moment. 
Then Marder asked slowly, "Captain Hulman, what do you expect 
us to do in this situation?" 

"Kill the snakes!" Hulman said 
promptly. "As many as we can 



find ! If the human beings of this 
world won't defend themselves, 
we'll have to defend them. As 
long as I've been here, no party 
of snakes has come past this 
point of the valley. A few of them 
have tried!" His eyes glittered 
with open hatred. "But I can't 
be on guard here forever. It's up 
to you and the other men on the 
ship to do the job right!" 

rpHOUGH Boyce was sleeping 
uneasily, Marder hadn't yet 
shut his eyes. The uneasiness was 
in him, too; and in him it was 
strong enough to offset the fatigue and excitement of the day. 
Vague night sounds came into 
the room they shared, a plaintive, 
thin calling like the distant cry 
of a bird. Not too different from 
the sounds on many other worlds 
he had known, and, as on all 
worlds that were new and strange, 
faintly tinged with the menace 
that was largely in the imagination. 

But it was Hulman himself who 
was the principal cause of Marder's uneasiness. 

The face of the old explorer, 
the rumbling, angry voice, his 
monomaniacal devotion to the 
strange humanoids kept recurring in his mind. Nothing Hulman had done previously to 
stimulate the imagination of 
Earthmen toward the laborious 
exploration of space could equal 



58 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this final accidental achievement: 
to have encountered the first 
other human beings Earthmen 
had yet discovered in the Universe. Men had looked out from 
their world like children staring 
into a great, dark forbidding 
room. They had found space to be 
peopled sparsely with intelligent 
life — life that was sometimes horrible, sometimes merely odd, 
sometimes beautiful in weird, incomprehensible ways. But never 
enough like Man to be acceptable! 

Hulman's fierce insistence on 
protecting what seemed to be the 
dying remnants of a human race 
against its own wishes was 
something Marder could understand well enough. He did not 
doubt that Boyce and the others 
would respond wholeheartedly to 
that insistence. Here was the 
proof that human life could rise 
spontaneously and endlessly 
throughout all the galaxies, that 
the Universe was not a darkened 
room, after all, but one lighted 
forever by the fires of humanity. 

They had to protect that 
proof . . . 

Strangely enough, though 
Boyce was asleep and he awake, 
it was Boyce who first seemed 
aware of motion in the house. 
Marder heard him breathe and 
stir unquietly, and then come 
awake and grow still, listening, 
waiting. He smiled faintly at the 




familiar signs, the tense alertness, 
the silent questioning of the 
strange world about them : "What 
is it? Who moves?" On many 
other strange, dark worlds, he had 
been among Earthmen as they 
came awake, asking that question. And he with them . . . 

He grew aware of it then: there 
was motion in the house now, beyond the walls. Gradually, it resolved itself into slow, heavy 
steps on the carpeted flooring; 
and the picture of Hulman leaving his room to peer down the 
stairs came so convincingly into 
his mind that at once he relaxed 
again. And he was aware that 
Boyce was relaxing too. 

Neither of them spoke. After 
a time, Hulman went back to his 
room, walking carefully so as not 
to disturb his guests; and the 
house was still. Presently, Boyce 
was sleeping again. Marder tried 
to pick up the train of thoughts 
he had been following before the 
disturbance; but they eluded him 
now. Fatigue grew up in him like 
waves of mental darkness, smothering the remnants of uneasiness; 
and reluctantly he let himself 
drift off. 

The blast that roused him 
seemed to have gone off almost 
beside his head. 

TTE found himself standing in 
the center of the room, gun 
in one hand, flashbeam in the 



CARETAKER 



59 



other. Boyce's wide back was 
just disappearing through the 
door into the dark hall beyond; 
and Boyce's shout was in his 
ears: 

"Hulman! They've got Hulman!" 

Marder halted a fraction of a 
second, checked by the ridiculous 
hesitation of a man who doesn't 
want to go out into a strange 
house undressed; then he was following Boyce. As he plunged 
down the broad staircase to the 
lower floor of Hulman's house, a 
memory flashed into his mind: 
the guns that Hulman, cut off 
from standard power sources, had 
manufactured for himself here 
and shown them earlier in the 
evening. It had been the report 
of a missile gun that had awakened him; one of Hulman's own. 

He lost Boyce's light for a moment when he reached the lower 
floor, and stood in indecision until 
he heard a muffled shouting to 
his left, and remembered the descent into the cellars. As he reached the door, there was another 
angry shout from Boyce, and a 
blaze of pink light from below. 
Boyce had cut loose with his gun, 
so he was in contact with the intruders; and things would have 
to be finished very quickly now 
— a thermion spray was not designed to be an indoor weapon! 

Marder reached the bottom of 
the cellar stairs seconds later. 



A hedge of flame to their right, 
steady, impenetrable and soundless, slanted from the wall half 
around the great well. It cut them 
off from further advance; presumably it had cornered their 
antagonists. 

Boyce, dressed in nightshorts, 
turned a furiously contorted face 
to him. 

"One of them ducked around 
the corner over there! It can't get 
out. It was carrying Hulman!" 

"Where is Hulman?" 

"Over there — dead!" 

"jlATARDER squinted against the 
reflected glare of the fire. 
Something dark lay hunched 
against the wall beyond the well; 
that was all he could make out. 

"Sure he's dead?" His voice 
carefully matter-of-fact. 

"Of course!" Boyce said beside 
him. The hand that held the gun 
was shaking. "When it dropped 
him — when I snapped a bolt at it 
— I saw he'd been shot through 
the head with his own gun!" 

"The natives?" Marder asked, 
still carefully. 

"No. Something— those snakes 
he was afraid of — some animal. 
It whipped around the corner before I saw it very clearly — " 

His voice had gone dull. Marder glanced at him quickly. Boyce 
was in a state of semi-shock, and 
they had only a few minutes before the fire ate far enough into 



60 




 



the walls to threaten their retreat 
upstairs and out of the house. He 
had no personal qualms about 
leaving Hulman's body and Hulman's slayers to roast together — 
the coincidence of murder on that 
particular night was something 
one could flgure out more conveniently later — but Boyce might 
present a problem. 

A voice addressed them from 
out of a passage beyond the well. 

"You who were his friends," it 
said, "will you listen to me?" 

Marder felt his scalp crawling. 
"Who are you?" he called back. 

"He called me his wife." 

Boyce started violently, but 
Marder waved him to silence. It 
was a rich, feminine voice, a trifle 
plaintive; it was not difficult to 
fit it mentally to the painting of 
Hulman's wife. 

"Why did you kill him?" 

There was a pause. 

"But I thought you understood," the voice said. "Your 
medical men would say that he 
had been insane for twenty years, 
as he counted time. They would 
have forced him back into sanity. 
I could not bear the thought that 
he should suffer that." 

Marder swallowed hard. "Suffer what?" 

"Are you all fools? He was a 
fool, though I loved him. He 
could not see behind the shape of 
things. So — here among us — he 
saw shapes he could bear to see. 



In those moments when sanity 
came to him and he really saw 
what was there — then he killed. 
Are you all like that?" 

DOYCE stared at Marder, his 
" mouth working. "What is 
she talking about?" he whispered 
hoarsely. "Is the snake with her?" 

"Go upstairs, Boyce! Wait for 
me outside!" 

"Are you going to kill the 
snake?" 

"Yes. I'll kill the snake." 

Boyce disappeared up the stairs. 

"The house is burning, but 
there is some time left," Marder 
told the voice then. "Is there any 
way you can save yourself?" 

"I can leave by the river that 
flows under the well," the voice 
said, "if you do not shoot' at me." 

"I won't shoot at you." 

"May I take his body?" 

Marder hesitated. "Yes." 

"And you will all leave with 
your ship? I loved him, though 
my people thought it strange almost beyond their tolerance. 
They are foolish, too, yet not as 
foolish as you are. They saw what 
was in his mind and not beyond 
that, and so they were afraid of 
him. But he is dead now and 
there is nothing that your people 
and mine could share. We are 
too different. Will you leave?" 

Marder moistened his lips. 
"We'll leave," he said, seeing it 
all now, and glad he had sent

Boyce upstairs. "What did you 
see beyond what was in his 
mind?" 

"A brave spirit, though very 
frightened," the voice said slowly. "He ventured far and far and 
far into the dark of which he was 
afraid. I loved him for that!" It 
paused. "I am coming now," it 
added, "and I think you had better look away." 

Marder did not intend to look 
away, but at the last moment, 
when there was movement at the 
corner of the passage, he did. He 
saw only a swift undulating 
shadow pass along the wall, pause 
and stoop quickly, rise again with 
a bulky burden clasped to it, 
glide on and vanish. 

He stood staring at the blank 
wall until there was a faint splash 
in the well far below him. 

^TlHE great ship was drifting 
slowly above the night side of 
the world it was leaving, when 
Commander Lowndes joined 
Marder at the observation port. 

"Boyce will make out all 
right," he said moodily. "He only 
guessed part of the truth, and 
that bit is being taken from his 
mind." He studied Marder 
thoughtfully. "If you'd looked 
squarely at the thing, we might 
have had to give you the same 
treatment. Our pickled specimens 
are pretty damned hideous." 

Marder shrugged. Lowndes sat 



on the edge of a table. 

"Selective hysterical blindness 
maintained for twenty-two years 
— with his own type of artistic 
hallucinations thrown in! I can't 
help wishing it hadn't happe'ned 
to Hulman." 

"He didn't maintain it through- ■ 
out," Marder said slowly. "And 
whenever he saw them clearly, he 
killed them . . ." 

"Who wouldn't? I almost feel," 
Lowndes said, "like getting out of 
space and staying out, for good!" 

Which was giving it the ultimate in emphasis. 

"What are you reporting?" 
Marder asked. 

"That Hulman died here, quite 
peacefully, about a year before 
we found him — leaving a diary of 
inspiring courage and devotion to 
space exploration behind him. 
We'll have time enough to work 
up the diary. That should keep 
everybody happy. Marder," he 
said suddenly, waving his hand 
at the observation port, "do you 
think there actually are — well, 
people out there. Somewhere?" 

Marder looked out at the vast, 
star-studded, shining black immensity. 

"I hope so," he said. 

"Do you think we'll ever find 
them?" 

"I don't know," Marder said 
thoughtfully. "They've never 
found us."
