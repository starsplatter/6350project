Home is the Hunter By C. L. MOORE and Henry Kuttner



THERE'S nobody I can 
talk to except myself. I 
stand here at the head of 
the great waterfall of marble steps 
dropping into the reception hall 
below, and all my wives in all 
their jewels are waiting, for this 
is a Hunter's Triumph — my Triumph, Honest Roger Bellamy, 
Hunter. The light glitters on the 
glass cases down there with the 
hundreds of dried heads that I 
have taken in fair combat, and 
I'm one of the most powerful men 
in New York. 




The heads make me powerful. 

But there's nobody I can talk 
to. Except myself? Inside me, listening, is there another Honest 
Roger Bellamy? I don't know. 
Maybe he's the only real part of 
me. I go along the best I can, 
and it doesn't do any good. Maybe the Bellamy inside of me 
doesn't like what I do. But I have 
to do it. I can't stop, for I was 
born a Hunter. It's a great heritage to be born to. Who doesn't 
envy me? Who wouldn't change 
with me, if they could? 




HOME IS THE HUNTER

But knowing that doesn't help 
at all. 

I'm no good. 

Listen to me, Bellamy, listen to 
me, if you're there at all, deep 
inside my head. You've got to 
listen — you've got to understand. 
You, there, inside the skull. You 
can turn up in a glass case in 
some other Hunter's reception 
hall any day now, any day, with 
the crowds of Populi outside 
pressing against the view-windows and the guests coming in to 
see and envy, and all the wives 
standing by in satin and jewels. 

Maybe you don't understand, 
Bellamy. You should feel fine 
now. It must be that you don't 
know this real world I have to go 
on living in. A hundred years ago, 
or a thousand, it might have been 
different. But this is the Twentyfirst Century. It's today, it's now, 
and there's no turning back. 

I don't think you understand. 

YOU see, there isn't any choice. 
Either you end up in another 
Hunter's glass case, along with 
your whole collection of heads, 
while your wives and children 
are turned out to be Populi, or 
else you die naturally (suicide is 
one way) and your eldest son 
inherits your collection, and you 
become immortal, in a plastic 
monument. You stand forever in 
transparent plastic on a pedestal 
along the edge of Central Park, 



like Renway and old Falconer 
and Brennan and all the others. 
Everyone remembers and admires and envies you. 

Will you keep on thinking then, 
Bellamy, inside the plastic? Will 
I? 

Falconer was a great Hunter. 
He never slowed down, and he 
lived to be fifty-two. For a 
Hunter, that is a great old age. 
There are stories that he killed 
himself. I don't know. The wonder is that he kept his head on 
his shoulders for fifty-two years. 
The competition is growing harder, and there are more and more 
younger men these days. 

Listen to me, Bellamy, the Bellamy within. Have you ever really 
understood? Do you still think 
this is the wonderful young time, 
the boyhood time, when life is 
easy? Were you ever with me in 
the long, merciless years while my 
body and mind learned to be a 
Hunter? I'm still young and 
strong. My training has never 
stopped. But the early years were 
the hardest. 

Before then, there was the wonderful time. It lasted for six years 
only, six years of happiness and 
warmth and love with my mother 
in the harem, and the fostermothers and the other children. 
My father was very kind then. 
But when I was six, it stopped. 
They shouldn't have taught us 
love at all, if it had to end so 



64 




 



soon. Is it that you remember, 
Bellamy within? If it is, it can 
never come back. You know that. 
Surely you know it. 

The roots of the training were 
obedience and discipline. My 
father was not kind any more. 
I did not see my mother often 
and, when I did, she was changed, 
too. Still, there was praise. There 
were the parades when, the Populi cheered me and my father. He 
and the trainers praised me when 
I showed I had special skill in 
the duel, or in marksmanship, or 
judo-stalking. 

It was forbidden, but my 
brothers and I sometimes tried 
to kill each other. The trainers 
watched us carefully. I was not 
the heir, then. But I became the 
heir when my elder brother's neck 
was broken in a judo- fall. It 
seemed an accident, but of course 
it wasn't, and then J had to be 
more careful than ever. I had to 
become very skillful. 

All that time, all that painful 
time, learning to kill. It was natural. They kept telling us how natural it was. We had to learn. And 
there could be only one heir . . . 

We lived under a cloud of fear 
even then. If my father's head 
h ad been taken, we would all 
have been turned out of the mansion. Oh, we wouldn't have gone 
hungry or unsheltered. Not in this 
age of science. But not to be a 
Hunter! Not to become immortal, 



in a plastic monument standing 
by Central Park! 

SOMETIMES I dream that I 
am one of the Populi. It seems 
strange, but in the dream I am 
hungry. And that is impossible. 
The great power plants supply 
all that the world needs. Machines synthesize food and build 
houses and give us all the necessities of life. I could never be one 
of the Populi, but if I were, I 
would go into a restaurant and 
take whatever food I wished out 
of the little glass-fronted compartments. I would eat well — far 
better than I eat now, as a matter 
of fact. And yet, in my dream, I 
am hungry. 

Perhaps the food I eat does not 
satisfy you, Bellamy within me. 
It does not satisfy me, but it is 
not meant to. It is nutritious. Its 
taste is unpleasant, but all the 
necessary proteins and minerals 
and vitamins are in it to keep 
my brain and body at their highest pitch. And it should not be 
pleasant. It is not pleasure that 
leads a man to immortality in 
plastic. Pleasure is a weakening 
and an evil thing. 

Bellamy within — do you hate 
me? 

My life has not been easy. It 
isn't easy now. The stubborn flesh 
fights against the immortal future, urging a man to be weak. 
But if you are weak, how long

can you hope to keep your head 
on your shoulders? 

The Populi sleep with their 
wives. I have never even kissed 
any of mine. (Is it you who have 
sent me those dreams?) My children? Yes, they are mine; artificial insemination is the answer. I 
sleep on a hard bed. Sometimes I 
wear a hair shirt. I drink only 
* water. My food is tasteless. With 
my trainers I exercise every day, 
until I am very tired. The life is 
hard — but in the end we shall 
stand forever in a plastic monument, you and I, while the world 
envies and admires. I shall die a 
Hunter and I shall be immortal. 

The proof is in the glass cases 
down there in my reception hall. 
The heads, the heads — look, Bellamy, so many heads! Stratton, 
my first. I killed him in Central 
Park with a machete. This is the 
scar on my temple that he gave 
me that night. I learned to be 
more deft. I had to. 

Each time I went into Central 
Park, fear and hate helped me. 
Often it is dreadful in the Park. 
We go there only at night, and 
sometimes we stalk for many 
nights before we take a head. The 
Park is forbidden, you know, to 
all but Hunters. 

It is our hunting ground. 

I have been shrewd and cunning and resourceful. I have 
shown great courage. I have stopped my fears and nursed my 



hate, there in the Park's shadows, 
listening, waiting, stalking, never 
knowing when I might feel sharp 
steel burning through my throat. 
There are no rules in the Park. 
Guns or clubs or knives — once I 
was caught in a man-trap, all 
steel and cables and sharp teeth. 
But I had moved in time, and 
fast enough, so I kept my right 
hand free and shot Miller between the eyes when he came to 
take me. There is Miller's head 
down in that case. You would 
never know a bullet had gone 
through his forehead, for the 
thanologists are clever. But usually we try not to spoil the heads. 

WHAT is it that troubles you 
so, Bellamy within? I am 
one of the greatest Hunters in 
New York. But a man must be 
cunning. He must lay traps and 
snares a long way in advance, 
and not only in Central Park. 
He must keep his spies active and 
his lines of contact taut in every 
mansion in the city. He must 
know who is powerful and who is 
not worth taking. What good 
would it do to win against a 
Hunter with only a dozen heads 
in his hall, while risking your own 
collection and your own head? 

I have hundreds. Until yesterday, I stood ahead of every man 
in my age-group. Until yesterday, I was the envy of all I knew, 
the idol of the Populi, the ac

knowledged master of half New. 
York. Half New York! Do you 
know how much that meant to 
me? That my rivals loathed me 
and acknowledged me their better? 

You do know, Bellamy. It was 
the breath of life that True Jonathan Hull and Good Ben Griswold ground their teeth when 
they thought of me, and that 
Black Bill Lindman and Whistler 
Cowles counted their trophies 
and then called me on the TV 
phone and begged me with tears 
of hate and fury in their eyes to 
meet them in the Park and give 
them the chance they craved. 

I laughed at them. I laughed 
Black Bill Lindman into a berserker rage and then almost envied him, because I have not been 
berserker myself for a long while 
now. I like that wild unloosening 
of all my awareness but one — the 
killing instinct, blind and without 
reason. I could forget even you 
then, Bellamy within. 

But that was yesterday. 

And yesterday night, Good Ben 
Griswold took a head. Do you 
remember how we felt when we 
learned of it, you and I? First I 
wanted to die, Bellamy. Then I 
hated Ben as I have never hated 
anyone before, and I have known 
much hate. I would not believe he 
had done it. I would not believe 
which head he took. 

I said it was a mistake, that he 



took a head from the Populi. But 
I knew I lied. No one takes a 
common head. They have no 
value. Then I said to myself, "It 
can't be the head of True Jonathan Hull. It can't be. It must not 
be!" For Hull was powerful. His 
hall held almost as many heads 
as mine. If Griswold were to have 
them all, he would be far more 
powerful than I. 

The thought was a torment I 
could not endure. 

I put on my Status Cap, with 
one bell on it for each head I 
have taken, and I went out to 
see. It was true, Bellamy. 

The mansion of Jonathan Hull 
was being emptied. The mob was 
surging in and out, while Hull's 
wives and children were leaving 
in little, quiet groups. The wives 
did not seem unhappy, but the 
boys did. (The girls had been 
sent to the Populi at birth, naturally ; they are worthless.) I 
watched the boys for a while. 
They were all wretched and angry. One was nearly sixteen, a big, 
agile lad who must have nearly 
finished his training. Someday I 
might meet him in the Park. 

The other boys were all too 
young. Now that their training 
had be*en interrupted, they would 
never dare enter the Park. That, 
of course, is why none of the 
Populi ever become Hunters. It 
takes long years of arduous training to turn a child from a rabbit

• to a tiger. In Central Park, only 
the tigers survive. 

1 LOOKED through True Jonathan's view- windows. I saw 
that the glass cases in his reception hall were empty. 

"So it is not a nightmare or a 
lie— Griswold does have them," 
I thought, "and True Jonathan's, 
besides." 

I went into a doorway and 
clenched my fists and beat them 
against the brownstone and 
groaned with self-contempt. 

I was no good at all. I hated 
myself, and I hated Griswold, 
too. Presently it was only that 
second hate that remained, so I 
knew what I had to do. 

"Today," I thought, "he stands 
where I stood yesterday. Desperate men will be talking to him, 
begging him, challenging him, 
trying every means they know to 
get him into the Park tonight. 
But I am crafty. I make my 
plans far ahead. I have networks 
that stretch into the mansions of 
every Hunter in the city, crossing their own webs." 

One of my wives, Nelda, was 
the key here. Long ago I realized 
that she was beginning to dislike 
me. I never knew why, but I fostered that dislike until it became 
hate. I saw to it that Griswold 
would learn the story. It is by 
strategems like this that I became as powerful as I was then — 



and will be again, will surely be 
again. 

I put on a glove, with hair and 
knuckle-lines and nails painted 
on to look like a hand, and I 
went to my TV phone and called 
Good Ben Griswold. He came 
grinning to the screen. 

"I challenge you, Ben," I said. 
"Tonight at nine, in the Park, by 
the carousel site." 

He laughed at me. He was a 
tall, heavily muscled man with a 
thick neck. 

I looked at his throat. 

"Tonight at nine," I repeated. 

He laughed again. "Oh, no, 
Roger," he said. "Why should I 
risk my head?" 

"You're a coward." 

"Certainly I'm a coward," he 
agreed, still grinning, "when 
there's nothing to gain and everything to lose. Was I a coward last 
night, when I took Hull's head? 
I've had my eye on him a long 
time, Roger. I'll admit I was 
afraid you'd get him first. Why 
didn't you, anyway?" 

"It's your head I'm after, Ben." 

"Not tonight," he said. ."Not 
for quite a while. I'm not going 
back to the Park for a long time; 
I'll be too busy. You're out of the 
running, anyhow, Roger. How 
many heads have you?" 

He knew, damn him, how far 
ahead of me he was — now. I let 
the hate show in my face. 

"The Park at nine tonight," I 



HOME IS, THE HUNTER 



yelled. "The carousel site. Or else 
I'll know you're afraid." 

"Eat your heart out, Roger," 
he mocked me. "Tonight I lead 
a parade. Watch me. Or don't — 
but you'll be thinking about me. 
You can't help that." 

"You swine! You rotten, cowardly swine!" 

HE laughed; he derided me, he 
goaded me, as I had done so 
many times to others. I did not 
have to pretend anger. I wanted 
to reach into the screen and sink 
my fingers in his throat. The furious rage was good to feel. It 
was very good. I let it build until 
it seemed high enough. I let him 
laugh and enjoy it. 

Then at last I did what I had 
been planning. At the right momerit, when it looked convincing, 
I let myself lose all control and 
I smashed my fist into the TV 
screen. It shattered. Griswold's 
face flew apart; I liked that. It 
was very satisfying. 

The connection was broken, of 
course. But 1 knew he would 
check quickly back. I slipped the 
protective glove from my right 
hand and called a servant I knew 
I could trust. (He is a criminal; 
I protect him. If I die, he will 
die and he knows it.) He bandaged my unharmed right hand 
and I told him what to say to 
the other servants. I knew the 
word would reach Nelda quick


ly, in the harem, and I knew that 
Griswold would hear within an 
hour. 

I fed my anger. All day, in the 
gymnasium, I practiced with my 
trainers, m achete and pistol in 
my left hand only. I made it 
seem that I was approaching the 
berserker stage, the killing madness that overcomes us when we 
feel we have completely failed. 

That kind of failure can have 
one of two results only. Suicide 
is the other. You risk nothing 
then, and you know your body 
will stand by the Park in its plastic monument. But sometimes the 
hate turns outward and there is 
no fear left. Then the Hunter is 
berserker, and while this makes 
him very dangerous, he is also 
good quarry then — he forgets his 
cunning. 

It was dangerous to me, too, 
for that kind of forgetfulness is 
very tempting, the next best thing 
to oblivion itself. 

Well, I had set the lure for 
Griswold. But it would take more 
than a lure to bring him out when 
he thought he had nothing to gain 
by such a risk. So I set rumors 
loose. They were very plausible 
rumors. I let it be whispered that 
Black Bill Lindman and Whistler 
Cowles, as desperate as I at Grisworld's triumph over us all, had 
challenged each other to a meeting in the Park that, night. Only 
one could come out alive, and

that one would be master of New 
York so far as our age-group 
counted power. (There was, of 
course, old Murdoch with his 
fabulous collection accumulated 
over a lifetime, but it was only 
among ourselves that the rivalry 
ran so high.) 

WITH that rumor abroad, I 
thought Griswold would 
act. There is no way to check 
such news. A man seldom announces openly that he is going 
into the Park. It could even be 
the truth, for all I knew. And for 
all Griswold knew, his supremacy 
was in deadly peril before he had 
even enjoyed his Triumph. There 
would be danger, of course, if he 
went out to defend his victory. 
Lindman and Cowles are both 
good Hunters. But Griswold, if 
he did not suspect my trap, had 
a chance at one sure victory — 
myself, Honest Roger Bellamy, 
waiting in berserker fury at a 
known rendezvous and with a 
right hand useless for fighting. 
Did it seem too obvious? Ah, but 
you don't know Griswold. 

When it was dark, I put on 
my hunting clothes. They are 
bulletproof, black, close-fitting, 
but very easy with every motion. 
I blacked my face and hands. I 
took gun, knife and machete with 
me, the metal treated so that it 
would not catch or reflect the 
light. I like a machete especially 



— I have strong arms. I was careful not to use my bandaged hand 
at all, even when I thought no 
one watched me. And I remembered that I must seem on the 
verge of berserker rage, because 
I knew Griswold's spies would be 
reporting every motion I made. 

I went toward Central Park, 
the entrance nearest the carousel 
site. That far Griswold's men 
could track me, but no farther. 

At the gate I lingered for a moment — do you remember this, 
Bellamy within me? Do you remember the plastic monuments 
we passed on the edge of the 
Park? Falconer and Brennan and 
the others, forever immortal, 
standing proud and godlike in the 
clear, eternal blocks. All passion 
spent, all fighting done, their 
glory assured forever. Did you 
envy them, too, Bellamy? 

I remember how old Falconer's 
eyes seemed to look through me 
contemptuously. The number of 
heads he had taken is engraved 
on the base of his monument, and 
he was a very great man. 

"Wait," I thought. "I'll stand 
in plastic, too. I'll take more 
heads than even you. Falconer, 
and the day that I do, it will be 
the day I can lay this burden 
down ..." 

Just inside the gate, in the 
deep shadows, I slipped the bandage from my right hand. I drew 
my black knife and, close against 



HOME IS THE HUNTER 



the wall, I began to work my way 
rapidly toward the little gate 
which is nearest Griswold's mansion. I had, of course, no intention 
of going anywhere near the carousel site. Griswold would be in a 
hurry to get to me and out again, 
and he might not stop to think. 
Griswold was not a thinker. I 
gambled on his taking the closest 
route. 

I waited, feeling very solitary 
and liking the solitude. It was 
hard to stay angry. The trees 
whispered in the darkness. The 
moon was rising from the Atlantic beyond Long Island. I thought 
of it shining on the Sound and on 
the city. It would rise like this 
long after I was dead. It would 
glitter on the plastic of my monument and bathe my face with cold 
light long after you and I, Bellamy, are at peace, our long war 
with each other ended. 

rpHEN I heard Griswold coming. I tried to empty my mind 
of everything except killing. It 
was for this that my body and 
mind had been trained so painfully ever since I was six years 
old. I breathed deeply a few 
times. As always, the deep, 
shrinking fear tried to rise in me. 
fear, and something more. Something within me — is it you, Bellamy? — that says I do not really 
want to kill. 

Then Griswold came into sight, 



and the familiar, hungry hatred 
made everything all right again. 

I do not remember very much 
about the fight. It all seemed to 
happen within a single timeless 
interval, though I suppose it went 
on for quite a long while. It 
was a hard, fast, skillful fight. 
We both wore bulletproof clothing, but we were both wounded 
before we got close enough to try 
for each other's heads with steel. 
He favored a saber, which was 
longer than my machete. Still, it 
was an even battle. We had to 
fight fast, because the noise might 
draw other Hunters, if there were 
any in the Park tonight. 

But in the end I killed him. 

I took his head. The Moon was 
not yet clear of the high buildings 
on the other side of the Park and 
the night was young. 

I summoned a taxi. Within 
minutes, I was back in my mansion, with my trophy. Before I 
would let the surgeons treat me, 
I saw to it that the head was 
taken to the laboratory for a 
quick treatment, a very quick 
preparation. And I sent out orders for a midnight Triumph. 

While I lay on the table and 
the surgeons washed and dressed 
my wounds, the news was flashing through the city already. My 
servants were in Griswold's mansion, transferring his collections 
to my reception hall, setting up 
extra cases that would hold all

my trophies, all True Jonathan 
Hull's and all of Griswold's, too. 
I would be the most powerful 
man in New York, under such 
masters as old Murdoch and one 
or two more. All my age-group 
and the one above it would be 
wild with envy and hate. I 
thought of Lindman and Cowles 
and laughed with triumph. 

I thought it was triumph — 
then. 

T STAND now at the head of 
the staircase, looking down at 
the lights and the brilliance, the 
row upon row of trophies, my 
wives in all their jewels. Servants 
are moving to the great bronze 
doors to swing them ponderously 
open. What will be revealed? The 
throng of guests, the great Hunters coming to give homage to a 
greater Hunter? Or — suppose no 
one has come to my Triumph, 
after all? 

The bronze doors are beginning 
to open. And I'm afraid. The 
fear that never leaves a Hunter, 
except in his last and greatest 
Triumph, is with me now. Suppose, while I stalked Griswold 
tonight, some other Hunter ambushed even bigger game — what 
if, for example, someone has 
taken old Murdoch's head? Then 
someone else would be having a 
Triumph in New York tonight, a 
greater Triumph than mine! 

The fear is choking me. I've 



failed. Some other Hunter has 
beaten me. I'm no good . . . 

No. Listen. Listen to them 
shouting my name! Look, look at 
them pouring in through the 
opened doors, all the great Hunters and their jewel -flashing women, thronging in to fill the 
bright hall beneath me. I feared 
too soon. I was the only Hunter 
in the Park tonight, after all. So 
I have won, and this is my Triumph. 

There's Lindman. There's 
Cowles. I can read their expressions very, very easily. They can't 
wait to get me alone tonight and 
challenge me to a duel in the 
Park. 

They all raise their arms toward me in salute. They shout 
my name. 

I beckon to a servant. He hands 
me the filled glass that is ready. 
Now I look down at the Hunters 
of New York — I look down from 
the height of my Triumph — and 
I raise my glass to them. 

I drink. 

Hunters, you cannot rob me 
now. 

I shall stand proud in plastic, 
godlike in the eternal block that 
holds me, all passion spent, all 
fighting done, my glory assured 
forever. 

The poison works quickly. 
This is the real Triumph !
