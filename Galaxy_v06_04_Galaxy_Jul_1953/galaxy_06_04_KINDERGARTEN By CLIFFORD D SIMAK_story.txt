KINDERGARTEN By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

HE went walking in the 
morning before the Sun 
was up, down past the 
old, dilapidated barn that was 
falling in upon itself, across the 
stream and up the slope of pasture ankle-deep with grass and 
summer flowers, when the world 
was wet with dew and the chill 
edge of night still lingered in the 
air. 

He went walking in the morning because he knew he might not 
have too many mornings left; 
any day, the pain might close 
down for good and he was ready 
for it — he'd been ready for it for 
a long time now. 



He was in no hurry. He took 
each walk as if it were his last 
and he did not want to miss a 
single thing on any of the walks 
— the turned-up faces of the pasture roses with the tears of dew 
running down their cheeks or the 
matins of the birds in the thickets 
that ran along the ditches. 

He found the machine alongside the path that ran through 
a thicket at the head of a ravine. 
At first glance, he was irritated 
by it, for it was not only unfamiliar, but an incongruous thing 
as well, and he had no room in 
heart or mind for anything but 
the commonplace. It had been 
the commonplace, the expected, the basic reality of Earth and 
the life one lived on it which he 
had sought in coming to this 
abandoned farm, seeking out a 
place where he might stand on 
ground of his own choosing to 
meet the final day. 

He stopped in the path and 
stood there, looking at this 
strange machine, feeling the roses 
and the dew and the early morning bird song slip away from him, 
leaving him alone with this thing 
beside the path which looked for 
all the world like some fugitive 
from a home appliance shop. But 
as he looked at it, he began to see 
the little differences and he knew 
that here was nothing he'd, ever 
seen before or heard of — that it 
most certainly was not a wander

ing automatic washer or a delinquent dehumidifier. 

FOR one thing, it shone — not 
with surface metallic luster or 
the gleam of sprayed-on porcelain, but with a shine that was 
all the way through whatever it 
was made of. If you looked at it 
just right, you got the impression 
that you were seeing into it, 
though not clearly enough to be 
able to make out the shape of 
any of its innards. It was rectangular, at a rough guess three 
feet by four by two, and it was 
without knobs for one to turn or 
switches to snap on or dials to 
set — which suggested that it was 
not something one was meant to 
operate. 

He walked over to it and bent 
down and ran his hand along its 
top, without thinking why he 
should reach out and touch it, 
knowing when it was too late 
that probably he should have 
left it alone. But it seemed to be 
all right to touch it, for nothing 
happened — not right away, at 
least. The metal, or whatever it 
was made of, was smooth to the 
hand -and beneath the sleekness 
of its surface he seemed to sense 
a terrible hardness and a frightening strength. 

He took his hand away and 
straightened up, stepped back. 

The machine clicked, just once, 
and he had the distinct impres


sion that it clicked not because 
it had to click to operate, not because it wa s turning itself on , 
but to attract attention, to let 
him know that it was an operating machine and that it had a 
function and was ready to perform it. And he got the impression that for whatever purpose it 
might operate, it would do so 
with high efficiency and a minimum of noise. 

Then it laid an egg. 

Why he thought of it in just 
that way, he never was able to 
explain, even later when he had 
thought about it. 

But, anyhow, it laid an egg, 
and the egg was a piece of jade, 
green with milky whiteness running through it, and exquisitely 
carved with what appeared to be 
outre symbolism. 

He stood there in the path, 
looking at the jade, for a moment 
forgetting in his excitement how 
it had materialized, caught up 
by the beauty of the jade itself 
and the superb workmanship 
that had wrought it into shape. 
It was, he told himself, the finest 
piece that he had ever seen and 
he knew exactly how its texture 
would feel beneath his fingers 
and just how expertly, upon close 
examination, he would find the 
carving had been done. 

He bent and picked it up and 
held it lovingly between his 
hands, comparing it with the 



6 




 



pieces he had known and handled for years in the museum. 
But now, even with the jade between his hands, the museum was 
a misty place, far back along the 
corridors of time, although it had 
been less than three months 
since he had walked away from 
it. 

"Thank you," he said to the 
machine and an instant later 
thought what a silly thing to do, 
talking to a machine as if it were 
a person. 

The machine just sat there. It 
did not click again and it did not 
move. 

So finally he left, walking back 
to the old farmhouse on the slope 
above the barn. 

¥N the kitchen, he placed the 
jade in the center of the table, 
where he could see it while he 
worked. He kindled a fire in the 
stove and fed in split sticks of 
wood, not too large, to make 
quick heat. He put the kettle on 
to warm and got dishes from the 
pantry and set his place. He fried 
bacon and drained it on paper 
toweling and cracked the last of 
the eggs into the skillet. 

He ate, staring at the jade that 
stood in front of him, admiring 
once again its texture, trying to 
puzzle out the symbolism of its 
carving and finally wondering 
what it might be worth. Plenty, 
he thought— although, of all con


siderations, that was the least 
important. 

The carving puzzled him. It 
was in no tradition that he had 
ever seen or of which he had ever 
read. What it was meant to represent, he could not imagine. And 
yet it had a beauty and a force, a 
certain character, that tagged it 
as no haphazard doodling, but as 
the product of a highly developed 
culture. 

He did not hear the young 
woman come up the steps and 
walk across the porch, but first 
knew that she was there when 
she rapped upon the door frame. 
He looked up from the jade and 
saw her standing in the open 
kitchen doorway and at first sight 
of her he found himself, ridicu' lously, thinking of her in the 
same terms he had been thinking 
of the jade. 

The jade was cool and green 
and she was crisp and white, but 
her eyes, he thought, had the soft 
look of this wondrous piece of 
jade about them, except that 
they were blue. 

"Hello, Mr. Chaye," she said. 

"Good morning," he replied. 

She was Mary Mallet, Johnny's 
sister. 

"Johnny wanted to go fishing," 
Mary told him. "He and the little 
Smith boy. So I brought the milk 
and eggs." 

"I am pleased you did," said 
Peter, "although you should not

have bothered. I could have 
walked over later. It would have 
done me good." 

He immediately regretted that 
last sentence, for it was something he was thinking too much 
lately — that such and such an act 
or the refraining from an act 
would do him good when, as a 
matter of plain fact, there was 
nothing that would help him at 
all. The doctors had made at 
least that much clear to him. 

TIE took the eggs and milk and 
asked her in and went to 
place the milk in the cooler, for 
he had no electricity for a refrigerator. 

"Have you had breakfast?" he 
asked. 

Mary said she had. 

"It's just as well," he said wryly. "My cooking's pretty bad. 
I'm just camping out, you know." 

And regretted that one, too. 

Chaye, he told himself, quit 
being so damn maudlin. 

' 'What a pretty thing ! " exclaimed Mary. "Wherever did 
you get it?" 

"The jade? Now, that's a funny thing. I found it." 

She reached, a hand out for it. 

"May I?" 

"Certainly," said Peter. 

He watched her face as she 
picked it up and held it in both 
hands, carefully, as he had held 

it . 



"You found this?" 

"Well, I didn't exactly find it, 
Mary. It was given to me." 

"A friend?" 

"I don't know." 

"That's a funny thing to say." 

"Not so funny. I'd like to 
show you the — well, the character 
who gave it to me. Have you got 
a minute?" 

"Of course X have," said Mary, 
"although I '11 have to hurry . 
Mother's canning peaches." 

They went down the slope 
together, past the barn, and crossed the creek to come into the pasture. As they walked up the 
pasture, he wondered if they 
would find it there, if it still was 
there — or ever had been there. 

It was. 

"What an outlandish thing !" 
said Mary. 

"That's the word exactly," 
Peter agreed. 

"What is it, Mr. Chaye?" 

"I don't know." 

"You said you were given the 
jade. You don't mean . . ." 

"But I do," said Peter. 

They moved closer to the machine and stood watching it. Peter 
noticed once again the shine of it 
and the queer sensation of being 
able to see into it — not very far, 
just part way, and not very well 
at that. But still the metal or 
whatever it was could be seen 
into, and that was somehow uncomfortable.

Mary bent over and ran her 
fingers along its top. 

"It feels all right," she said. 
"Just like porcelain or — " 

The machine clicked and a 
flagon lay upon the grass. 

"For you," said Peter. 

"For me?" 

OETER picked up the tiny bottie and handed it to her. It 
was a triumph of glassblower's 
skill and it shone with sparkling 
prismatic color in the summer 
sunlight. 

"Perfume would be my guess," 
he said. 

She worked the stopper loose. 

"Lovely," she breathed and 
held it out to him to smell. 

It was all of lovely. 

She corked it up again. 

"But, Mr. Chaye . . .*' 

"I don't know," said Peter. "I 
simply do not know." 

"Not even a guess?" 

He shook his head. 

"You just found it here." 

"I was out for a walk — " 

"And it was waiting for you." 

"Well, now . . ." Peter began 
to object, but now that he 
thought about it, that seemed exactly right — he had not found the 
machine: it had been waiting for 
him. 

"It was, wasn't it?" 

"Now that you mention it," 
said Peter, "yes, I guess it was 
waiting for me." 



Not for him specifically, perhaps, but for anyone who might 
come along the path. It had been 
waiting to be found, waiting for 
a chance to go into its act, to do 
whatever it was supposed to do. 

For now it appeared, as plain 
as day, that someone had left it 
there. 

He stood in the pasture with 
Mary Mallet, farmer's daughter, 
standing by his side — with the 
familiar grasses and the undergrowth and trees, with the shrill 
of locust screeching across the 
rising heat of day, with the faroff tinkle of a cowbell — and felt 
the chill of the thought within 
his brain, the cold and terrible 
thought backgrounded by the 
black of space and the dim endlessness of time. And he felt, as 
well, a reaching out of something, 
of a chilly alien thing, toward the 
warmth of humanity and Earth. 

"Let's go back," he said. 

rTiHEY returned across the pasture to the house and stood 
for a moment at the gate. 

"Isn't there something we 
should do?" asked Mary. "Someone we should tell about it?" 

He shook his. head. "I want to 
think about it first." 

"And do something about it?" 

"There may be nothing that 
anyone can or should do." 

He watched her go walking 
down the road, then turned away

and went back to the house. 

He got out the lawn mower and 
cut the grass. After the lawn was 
mowed, he puttered in the flowerbed. The zinnias were coming 
along fine, but something had 
gotten into the asters and they 
weren't doing well. And the grass 
kept creeping in, he thought. No 
matter what he did, the grass 
kept creeping into the bed to 
strangle out the plants. 

After lunch, he thought, maybe I'll go fishing. Maybe going 
fishing will do me — 

He caught the thought before 
he finished it. 

He squatted by the flowerbed, 
dabbing at the ground with the 
point of his gardening trowel, 
and thought about the machine 
out in the pasture. 

I want to think about it, he'd 
told Mary, but what was there to 
think about? 

Something that someone had 
left in his pasture — a machine 
that clicked and laid a gift like 
an egg when you patted it. 

What did that mean? 

Why was it here? 

Why did it click and hand out 
a gift when you patted it? 

Response? The way a dog 
would wag its tail? 

Gratitude? For being noticed 
by a human? 

Negotiation? 

Friendly gesture? 

Booby trap? 



And how had it known he 
would have sold his soul for a 
piece of jade one-half as fine as 
the piece it had given him? 

How had it known a girl would 
like perfume? 

He heard the running footsteps behind him and swung 
around and there was Mary, running across the lawn. 

SHE reached him and went 
down on her knees beside him 
and her hands clutched his arm. 

"Johnny found it, too," she 
panted. "I ran all the way. Johnny and that Smith boy found it. 
They cut across the pasture corning home from fishing . . ." 

"Maybe we should have reported it," said Peter. 

"It gave them something, too. 
A rod and reel to Johnny and a 
baseball bat and mitt to. little 
Augie Smith." 

"Oh. good Lord!" 
"And now they're telling everyone." 

"It doesn't matter," Peter said. 
"At least, I don't suppose it matters." 

"What is that thing out there? 
You said you didn't know. But 
you have some idea. Peter, you 
must have some idea." 

"I think it's alien," Peter reluctantly and embarrassedly 
told her. "It has a funny look 
about it, like nothing I've ever 
seen or read about, and Earth ma

chines don't give away things 
when you lay a hand on them. 
You have to feed them coins first. 
This isn't — isn't from Earth." 

"From Mars, you mean?" 

"Not from Mars," said Peter. 
"Not from this solar system. We 
have no reason to think another 
race of high intelligence exists in 
this solar system and whoever 
dreamed up that machine had 
plenty of intelligence." 

"But . . . not from this solar 
system ..." 

"From some other star." 

"The stars are so far away!" 
she protested. 

So far away, thought Peter. So 
far out of the reach of the human 
race. Within the reach of dreams, 
but not the reach of hands. So far 
away and so callous and uncaring. And the machine — 

"Like a slot machine," he said, 
"except it always pays in jackpots and you don't even need a 
coin. That is crazy, Mary. That's 
one reason it isn't of this Earth. 
No Earth machine, no Earth inventor, would do that." 

"The neighbors will be coming," Mary said. 

"I know they will. They'll be 
coming for their handouts." 

"But it isn't very big. It could 
not carry enough inside it for 
the entire neighborhood. It does 
not have much more than room 
enough for the gifts it's already 
handed out." 



"Mary, did Johnny want a rod 
and reel?" 

"He'd talked of practically 
nothing else." 

"And you like perfume?" 

"I'd never had any good perfume. Just cheap stuff." She 
laughed a little nervously. "And 
you? Do you like jade?" 

"I'm what you might call a 
minor expert on it. It's a passion 
with me." 

"Then that machine . . 

"Gives each one the thing he 
wants," Peter finished for her. 

"It's frightening," said Mary. 

And it seemed strange that 
anything at all could be frightening on such a day as this — a 
burnished summer day, with 
white clouds rimming the western 
horizon and the sky the color of 
pale blue silk, a day that had no 
moods, but was as commonplace 
as the cornfield earth. 

A FTER Mary had left, Peter 
went in the house and made 
his lunch. He sat by the window, 
eating it, and watched the neighbors come. They came by twos 
and threes, tramping across the 
pasture from all directions, coming to his pasture from their own 
farms, leaving the haying rigs 
and the cultivators, abandoning 
their work in the middle of the 
day to see the strange machine. 
They stood around and talked, 
tramping down the thicket where

he had found the machine, and 
at times their high, shrill voices 
drifted across to him, but he 
could not make out what they 
said, for the words were flattened 
and distorted by the distance. 

From the stars, he'd said. From 
some place among the stars. 

And if that be fantasy, he said, 
I have a right to it. 

First contact, he thought. 

And clever! 

Let an alien being arrive on 
Earth and the women would run 
screaming for their homes and the 
men would grab their rifles and 
there'd be hell to pay. 

But a machine — that was a 
different matter. What if it was 
a little different? What if it acted 
a little strangely? After all, it 
was only a machine. It was something that could be understood. 

And if it handed out free gifts, 
that was all the better. 

After lunch, he went out and 
sat on the steps and some of the 
neighbors came and showed him 
what the machine had given 
them. They sat around and talked, all of them excited and mystified, but not a single one of them 
was scared. 

Among the gifts were wrist watches and floor lamps, typewriters and fruit juicers, sets of 
dishes, chests of silver, bolts of 
drapery materials, shoes, shotguns, carving sets, book ends, 
neckties, and many other items. 



One youngster had a dozen 
skunk traps and another had a 
bicycle. 

A modern Pandora's box, 
thought Peter, made by an alien 
intelligence and set down upon 
the Earth. 

Apparently the word was 
spreading, for now the people 
came in cars. Some of them parked by the road and walked down 
to the pasture and others came 
into the barnyard and parked 
there, not bothering to ask for 
permission. 

After a time, they would come 
back loaded with their loot and 
drive away. Out in the pasture 
was a milling throng of people. 
Peter, watching it, was reminded 
of a county fair or a village carnival. 

BY chore-time, the last of them 
had gone, even the neighbors 
who had come to say a few words 
with him and to show him what 
they'd gotten, so he left the house 
and walked up the pasture slope. 

The machine still was there 
and it was starting to build something. It had laid out around it 
a sort of platform of a stone that 
looked like marble, as if it were 
laying a foundation for a building. The foundation was about 
ten feet by twelve' and was set 
level against the pasture's slope, 
with footings of the same sort of 
stone going down into the ground.

He sat down on a stump a little 
distance away and looked out 
over the peace of the countryside. 
It seemed more beautiful, more 
quiet and peaceful than it had 
ever seemed before, and he sat 
there contentedly, letting the 
evening soak into his soul. 

rriHE Sun had set not more than 
half an hour ago. The western sky was a delicate lemon 
fading into green, with here and 
there the pink of wandering 
cloud, while beneath the horizon 
the land lay in the haze of a blue 
twilight, deepening at the edges. 
The liquid evensong of birds ran 
along the hedges and the thickets 
and the whisper of swallows' 
wings came down from overhead. 

This is Earth, he thought, the 
peaceful, human Earth, a landscape shaped by an agricultural 
people. This is the Earth of plum 
blossom and of proud red barns 
and of corn rows as straight as 
rifle barrels. 

For millions of years, the Earth 
had lain thus, without interference; a land of soil and life, a 
local corner of the Galaxy engaged in its own small strivings. 

And now? 

Now, finally, there was interference. 

Now, finally, someone or something had come into this local 
corner of the Galaxy and Earth 
was alone no longer. 



To himself, he knew, it did not 
matter. Physically, there was no 
longer anything that possibly 
could matter to him. All that was 
left was the morning brightness 
and the evening peace and from 
each of these, from every hour of 
each day that was left to him, it 
was his purpose to extract the 
last bit of joy in being alive. 

But to the others it would matter — to Mary Mallet and her 
brother Johnny, to the little 
Smith boy who had gotten the 
baseball bat and mitt, to all the 
people who had visited this pasture, and to all the millions who 
had not visited or even heard 
of it. 

Here, in this lonely place in 
the midst of the great cornlands, 
had come, undramatically, a 
greater drama than the Earth 
had yet known. Here was the 
pivot point. 

He said to the machine : "What 
do you intend with us?" 

There was no answer. 

He had not expected one. 

He sat and watched the shadows deepen and the lights spring 
up in the farm houses that were 
sprinkled on the land. Dogs barked from far away and others answered them and the cowbells 
rang across the hills like tiny 
vesper notes. 

At last, when he could see no 
longer, he walked slowly back to 
the house.

TN the kitchen, he found a lamp 
*- and lit it. He saw by the 

kitchen clock that it was almost 
nine o'clock — time for the evening news. 

He went into the living room 
and turned on the radio. Sitting 
in the dark, he listened to it. 

There was good news. 

There had been no polio deaths 
in the state that day and only 
one new case had been reported. 

"It is too soon to hope, of 
course," the newscaster said, "but 
it definitely is the first break in 



the epidemic. Up to the time of 
broadcast, there have been no 
new cases for more than twenty 
hours. The state health director 
said . . ." 

He went on to read what the 
health director said, which wasn't 
much of anything, just one of 
those public statements which 
pretty generally add up to nothing tangible. 

It was the first day in almost 
three weeks, the newscaster had 
said, during which no polio 
deaths had been reported. But 




Emmett murder trial had been 
postponed another month. 

Then he said: "Someone has 
just handed me a bulletin. Now 
let me see . . ." 

You could hear the paper rustling as he held it to read it 
through, could hear him gasp a 
little. 

"It says here," he said, "that 
Sheriff Joe Burns has just now 
been notified that a Flying Saucer 
has landed on the Peter Chaye 
farm out near Mallet Corners. 
No one seems to know too much 
about it. One report is that it was 
found this morning, but no one 
thought to notify the sheriff. Let 
me repeat — this is just a report. 
We don't know any more than 
what we've told you. We don't 
know if it is true or not. The 
sheriff is on his way there now. 
We'll let you know as soon as 
we learn anything. Keep tuned 
to this . . ." 

Peter got up and turned off the 
radio. Then he went into the 
kitchen to bring in the lamp. He 
set the lamp on a table and sat 
down again to wait for Sheriff 
Burns. 

He didn't have long to wait. 

"p^OLKS tell me," said the sheriff, "this here Flying Saucer 
landed on your farm." 

"I don't know if it's a Flying 
Saucer, Sheriff." 

"Well, what is it, then?" 



"I wouldn't know," said Peter. 

"Folks tell me it was giving 
away things." 

"It was doing that, all right." 

"If this is some cockeyed advertising stunt," the sheriff said, 
"I'll have someone's neck for it." 

"I'm sure it's not an advertising stunt." 

"Why didn't you notify me 
right off? What you mean by 
holding out on a thing like this?" 

"I didn't think of notifying 
you," Peter told him. "I wasn't 
trying to hold out on anything." 

"You new around here, ain't 
you?" asked the sheriff. "I don't 
recollect seeing you before. 
Thought I knew everyone." 

"I've been here three months." 

"Folks tell me you ain't farming the place. Tell me you ain't 
got no family. Live here all by 
yourself, just doing nothing." 

"That's correct," said Peter. 

The sheriff waited for the explanation, but Peter offered none. 
The sheriff looked at him suspiciously in the smOky lamplight. 

"Can you show us this here 
Flying Saucer?" 

By now Peter was a little weary 
of the sheriff, so he said, "I can 
tell you how to find it. You go 
down past the barn and cross the 
brook . . ." 

"Why don't you come with us, 
Chaye?" 

"Look, Sheriff, I was telling 
you how to find it. Do you want

me to continue?" 

"Why, sure," the sheriff said. 
"Of course I do. But why can't 
you . . ,** 

"I've seen it twice," said Peter. 
"I've been overrun by people all 
the afternoon." 

"All right, all right," the sheriff said. "Tell me how to find it." 

He told him and the sheriff 
left, followed by his two deputies. 

The telephone rang. 

Peter answered it. It was the 
radio station he'd been listening 
to. 

"Say," asked the radio reporter, "you got a Saucer out there?" 

"I don't think so," Peter said. 
"I do have something out here, 
though. The sheriff is going out 
to take a look at it." 

"We want to send out our mobile TV unit, but we wanted to 
be sure there was something 
there. It be all right with you if 
we send it out?" 

"No objections. Send it along." 

"You sure you got something 
there?" 

"I told you that I had." 

"Well, then, suppose you tell 
me . . ." 

Fifteen minutes later, he hung 
up. 

The phone rang again. 

TT was the Associated Press. 

The man at the other end of 
the wire was wary and skeptical. 
"What's this I hear about a 



Saucer out there?" 

Ten minutes later, Peter hung 
up. 

The phone rang almost immediately. 

"McClelland of the Tribune," 
said a bored voice. "I heard a 
screwball story . . ." 

Five minutes. 

The phone rang again. 

It was the United Press. 

"Hear you got a Saucer. Any 
little men in it?" 

Fifteen minutes. 

The phone rang. 

It was an irate citizen. 

"I just heard on the radio you 
got a Flying Saucer. What kind 
of gag you trying to pull? You 
know there ain't any Flying 
Saucers . . ." 

"Just a moment, sir," said 
Peter. 

He let the receiver hang by its 
cord and went out to the kitchen. 
He found a pair of clips and 
came back. He could hear the 
irate citizen still chewing him 
out, the voice coming ghostlike 
out of the dangling receiver. 

He went outside and found the 
wire and clipped it. When he 
came back in again, the receiver 
was silent. He hung it carefully 
on the hook. 

Then he locked the doors and 
went to bed. 

To bed, but not immediately to 
sleep. He lay beneath the covers, 
staring up into the darkness and

trying to quiet the turmoil of 
speculation that surged within his 
brain. 

He had gone walking in the 
morning and found a machine. 
He had put his hand upon it 
and it had given him a gift. 
Later on, it had given other gifts. 

"A machine came, bearing 
gifts," he said into the darkness. 

A clever, calculated, wellworked-out first contact. 

Contact them with something 
they will know and recognize and 
need not be afraid of, something 
to which they can feel superior. 

Make it friendly— and what is 
more friendly than handing out 
a gift? 

What is it? 

Missionary? 

Trader? 

Diplomat? 

Or just a mere machine and 
nothing more? 

Spy? Adventurer? Investigator? Surveyor? 

Doctor? Lawyer? Indian chief? 
■ And why, of all places, had it 
landed here, in this forsaken 
farmland, in this pasture on his 
farm? 

And its purpose? 

WHAT had been the purpose, 
the almost inevitable motive, of those fictional alien beings who, in tales of fantasy, had 
landed on Earth? 

To take over, of course. If 



not by force, then by infiltration 
or by friendly persuasion and 
compulsion; to take over not 
only Earth, but the human race 
as well. 

The man from the radio station had been excited, the Associated Press man had been 
indignant that anyone should so 
insult his intelligence, the Tribune 
man had been bored and the 
United Press man flippant. But 
the citizen had been angry. He 
was being taken in by another 
Flying Saucer story and it was 
just too much. 

The citizen was angry because 
he didn't want his little world 
disturbed. He wanted no interference. He had trouble enough 
of his own without things being 
messed up by a Saucer's landing. 
He had problems of his own — 
earning a living, getting along 
with his neighbors, planning his 
work, worrying about the polio 
epidemic. 

Although the newscaster had 
said the polio situation seemed a 
little brighter — no new cases and 
no deaths. And that was a fine 
thing, for polio was pain and 
death and a terror on the land. 

Pain, he thought. 

I've had no pain today. 

For the first time in many 
days, there has been no pain. 

He lay stiff and still beneath 
the covers, examining himself 
for pain. He knew just where it

lurked, the exact spot in his 
anatomy where it lurked hidden 
out of sight. He lay and waited 
for it, fearful, now that he had 
thought of it, that he would find 
it there. • 

But it was not there. 

He lay and waited for it, afraid 
that the very thought of it would 
conjure it up from its hiding 
place. It did not come. He dared 
it to come, he invited it to show 
itself, he hurled mental jibes at 
it to lure it out. It refused to be 
lured. 

He relaxed and knew that for 
the moment he was safe. But 
safe only temporarily, for the 
pain still was there. It bided its 
time , wa ited for its moment, 
would come when the time was 
right. 

With careless abandon, trying 
to wipe out the future and its 
threat, he luxuriated in life without the pain. He listened to the 
house — the slightly settling joists 
that made the floor boards creak, 
the thrum of the light summer 
wind against the weathered siding, the scraping of the elm 
branch against the kitchen roof. 

Another sound. A knocking at 
the door. "Chaye! Chaye, where 
are you?" 

"Coming," he called. 

TTE found slippers and went 
to the door. It was the sheriff 
and his men. 



"Light the lamp," the sheriff 
said. 

"You got a match?" Peter 
asked. 

"Yeah, here are some." 

Groping in the dark, Peter 
found the sheriff's hand and the 
book of matches. 

He located the table, slid his 
hand across the top and felt the 
lamp. He lit it and looked at 
the sheriff from across the table. 

"Chaye," the sheriff said, "that 
thing is building something." 

"I know it is." 

"What's the gag?" 

"There's no gag." 

"It gave me this," the sheriff 
said. 

He threw the object on the 
table. 

"A gun," said Peter. 

"You ever see one like it?" 

It was a gun, all right, about 
the size of a .45. But it had no 
trigger and the muzzle flared and 
the whole thing was made of 
some white, translucent substance. 

Peter picked it up and found it 
weighed no more than half a 
pound or so. 

"No,'* said Peter. "No, I've 
never seen one like it." He put 
it back on the table, gingerly. 
"Does it work?" 

"It does," the sheriff said. "I 
tried it on your barn." 

"There ain't no barn no more," 
said one of the deputies. 



KINDERGARTEN 



19 



"No report, no flash, no nothing," the sheriff added. 

"Just no barn," repeated the 
deputy, obsessed with the idea. 

A car drove into the yard. 

"Go out and see who's there," 
said the sheriff. 

One of the deputies went out. 

"I don't get it," complained the 
sheriff. "They said Flying Saucer, 
but I don't think it's any Saucer. 
A box is all it is." 

"It's a machine," said Peter. 

Feet stamped across the porch 
and men came through the door. 

"Newspapermen," said the deputy who had gone out to see. 

"I ain't got no statement, 
boys," the sheriff said. 

One of them said to Peter : 
"You Chaye?" 

Peter nodded. 

"I'm Hoskins from the Tribune. This is Johnson from the 
AP. That guy over there with the 
sappy look is a photographer, 
name of Langly. Disregard him." 

He pounded Peter on the back. 
"How does it feel to be sitting in 
the middle of the century's biggest news break? Great stuff, 
hey, boy?" 

Langly said: "Hold it." 

A flash bulb popped. 

"I got to use the phone," said 
Johnson. "Where is it?" 

"Over there," said Peter. "It's 
not working," 

"How come at a time like 
this?" 



"I cut the wire." 

"Cut the wire ! You crazy , 
Chaye?" 

"There were too many people 
calling." 

"Now," said -Hoskins, "wasn't 
that a hell of a thing to do?" 

"I'll fix her up," Langly offered. 
"Anyone got a pair of pliers?" 




iHE^ sheriff said, "You boys 
hold on a minute." 



"Hurry up and get into a pair 
of pants," Hoskins said to Peter. 
"We'll want your picture on the 
scene. Standing with your foot 
on it, like the guy that's just 
killed an elephant." 

"You listen here," the sheriff 
said. . 

"What is it, Sheriff?" 

"This here's important. Get it 
straight. You guys can't go messing around with it." 

"Sure it's important," said Hoskins. "That is why we're here. 
Millions of people standing 
around with their tongues hanging out for news." 

"Here are some pliers," someone remarked. 

"Leave me at that phone," said 
Langly. 

"What are we horsing around 
for?" asked Hoskins. "Let's go 
out and see it." 

"I gotta make a call," said 
Johnson. 

"Look here, boys," the sheriff 
insisted in confusion. "Wait — "

"What's it like, Sheriff? Figure 
it's a Saucer? How big is it? 
Does it make a clicking noise 
or something? Hey, Langly, take 
the sheriff's picture." 

"Just a minute," Langly shouted from outside. "I'm fixing up 
this wire." 

More feet came across the 
porch. A head was thrust into the 
door. 

"TV truck," the head said. 
"This the place? How do we get 
out to the thing?" 

The phone rang. 

Johnson answered it. 

"It's for you, Sheriff." 

The sheriff lumbered across the 
room. They waited, listening. 

"Sure, this is Sheriff Burns . . . 
Yeah, it's out there, all right . . . 
Sure, I know. I've seen it . . . No, 
of course, I don't know what it 
is . . . Yes, I understand . . . Yes, 
sir. . . . Yes, sir. I'll see to it, sir." 

He hung up the receiver and 
turned around to face them. 

"That was military intelligence," he said. "No one is going 
out there. No one's moving from 
this house. This place is restricted 
as of this minute." 

He looked from one to another 
of them ferociously. 

"Them's orders," he told them. 

"Oh, hell," said Hoskins. 

"I came all the way out here," 
bawled the TV man. "I'm not 
going to come out here and 
not . . 



"It isn't me that's doing the 
ordering," said the sheriff. "It's 
Uncle Sam. You boys take things 
easy." 

Peter went out into the kitchen 
and poked up the fire and set on 
the kettle. 

"The coffee's there," he said to 
Langly. "I'll put on some clothes." 

CLOWLY, the night wore on. 
^ Hoskins and Johnson phoned 
in the information they had 
jotted down on folded copy paper, their pencils stabbing cryptic 
signs as they talked to Peter and 
the sheriff. After some argument 
with the sheriff about letting him 
go, Langly left with his pictures. 
The sheriff paced up and down 
the room. 

The radio blared. The phone 
banged constantly. 

They drank coffee and smoked 
cigarettes, littering the floor with 
ground-out stubs. More newsmen 
pulled in, were duly warned by 
the sheriff, and settled down to 
wait. 

Someone brought out a bottle 
and passed it around. Someone 
else tried to start a poker game, 
but nobody was interested. 

Peter went out to get an armload of wood. The night was 
quiet, with stars. 

He glanced toward the pasture, 
but there was nothing there to see. 
He tried to make out the empty 
place where the barn had dis

appeared. It was too dark to tell 
whether the barn was there or 
not. 

Death watch or the last dark 
hour before the dawn — the brightest, most wonderful dawn that 
Man had ever seen in all his 
years of striving? 

The machine was building 
something out there, building 
something in the night. 

And what was it building? 

Shrine? 

Trading post? 

Mission house? 

Embassy? 

Fort? 

There was no way of knowing, 
no way that one could tell. 

Whatever it was building, it 
was the first known outpost ever 
built by an alien race on the 
planet Earth. 

He went back into the house 
with the load of wood. 

"They're sending troops," the 
sheriff told him. 

"Tramp, tramp, tramp," said 
Hoskins, dead - pan, cigarette 
hanging negligently to his under
up. 

"The radio just said so,*' the 
sheriff said. "They called out the 
guard." 

Hoskins and Johnson did some 
more tramp-tramping. 

"You guys better not horse 
around with them soldier boys," 
the sheriff warned. "They'll shove 
a bayonet . . ." 



Hoskins made a noise like a 
bugle blowing the charge. Johnson grabbed two spoons and beat 
out galloping hoofs. 

"The calvary!" shouted Hoskins. "By God, boys, we're 
saved!" 

Someone said wearily: "Can't 
you guys be your age?" 

They sat around, as the night 
wore on, drinking coffee and 
smoking. They didn't do much 
talking. 

The radio station finally signed 
off. Someone fooled around, trying to get another station, but 
the batteries were too weak to 
pull in anything. He shut the 
radio off. It had been some time 
now since the phone had rung. 

DAWN was still an hour away 
when the guardsmen arrived, 
not marching, nor riding horses, 
but in five canvas-covered trucks. 

The captain came in for just a 
moment to find out where this 
goddam obscenity Saucer was. 
He was the fidgety type. He 
wouldn't even stay for a cup 
of coffee. He went out yelling 
orders at the drivers. 

Inside the house, the others 
waited and heard the five trucks 
growl away. 

Dawn came and a building 
stood in the pasture, and it was 
a bit confusing, for you could see 
that it was being built in a way 
that was highly unorthodox. 



22 




 



Whoever or whatever was building it had started on the inside 
and was building outward, so that 
you saw the core of the building, 
as if it were a building that was 
being torn down and some one 
already had ripped off the entire 
exterior. 

It covered half an acre and 
was five stories high. It gleamed 
pink in the first light of the 
morning, a beautiful misty pink 
that made you choke up a little, 
remembering the color of the dress 
the little girl next door had worn 
for her seventh birthday party. 

The guardsmen were ringed 
around it, the morning light spattering off their bayonets as they 
stood the guard. 

Peter made breakfast — huge 
stacks of flapjacks, all the bacon 
he had left, every egg he could 
find, a gallon or two of oatmeal, 
more coffee. 

"We'll send out and get some 
grub," said Hoskins. "We'll make 
this right with you." 

After breakfast, the sheriff and 
the deputies drove back to the 
county seat. Hoskins took up a 
collection and went to town to 
buy groceries. The other newsmen stayed on. The TV truck 
got squared off for some wideangle distance shots. 

The telephone started jangling 
again. The newsmen took turns 
answering it. 

Peter walked down the road 



to the Mallet farm to get eggs 
and milk. 

Mary ran out to the gate to 
meet him. "The neighbors are 
getting scared," she said. 

"They weren't scared yesterday," said Peter. "They walked 
right up and got their gifts." 

" 'But this is diff erent, Peter. 
This is getting out of hand. The 
building . . ." 

And that was it, of course. 
The building. 

No one had been frightened of 
an innocent-appearing machine 
because it was small and friendly. 
It shone so prettily and it clicked 
so nicely and it handed out gifts. 
It was something that could be 
superficially recognized and it 
had a purpose that was understandable if one didn't look too 
far. 

But the building was big and 
might get bigger still and it was 
being erected inside out. And who 
in all the world had ever seen a 
structure built as fast as that one 
— five stories in one single night? 

"TJOW do they do it, Peter?" 

Mary asked in a hushed 
little voice. 

"I don't know," he said. "Some 
principle that is entirely alien to 
us, some process that men have 
never even thought of, a way of 
doing things, perhaps, that starts 
on an entirely different premise 
than the human way." 



KINDERGARTEN

"But it's just the kind of building that men themselves would 
build," she objected. "Not that 
kind of stone, perhaps — maybe 
there isn't any stone like that in 
the entire world — but in every 
other way there's nothing strange 
about it. It looks like a big high 
school or a department store." 

"My jade was jade," said Peter, 
"and your perfume was perfume 
and the rod and reel that Johnny 
got was a regular rod and reel." 

"That means they know about 
us. They know all there is to 
know. Peter, they've been watching us!" 

"I have no doubt of it." 

He saw the terror in her eyes 
and reached out a hand to draw 
her close and she came into his 
arms and he held her tightly and 
thought, even as he did so, how 
strange that he should be the 
one to extend comfort and assurance. 

"I'm foolish, Peter." 
"You're wonderful," he assured 
her. 

"I'm not really scared." 

"Of course you're not." He 
■wanted to say, "I love you," but 
he knew that those were words he 
could never say. Although the 
pain, he thought — the pain had 
not come this morning. 

"I'll get the milk and eggs," 
said Mary. 

"Give me all you can spare. 
I have quite a crowd to feed." 

24 



Walking back, he thought 
about the neighbors being frightened now and wondered how long 
it would be before the world got 
frightened, too — how long before 
artillery would be wheeling into 
line, how long before an atom 
bomb would fall. 

He stopped on the rise of the 
hill above the house and for the 
first time noticed that the barn 
was gone.. It had been sheared off 
as cleanly as if cut with a knife, 
with the stump of the foundation 
sliced away at an angle. 

He wondered if the sheriff still 
had the gun and supposed he had. 
And he wondered what the sheriff 
would do with it and why it had 
been given him. For, of all the 
gifts that he had seen, it was the 
only one that was not familiar to 
Earth. 

In the pasture that had been 
empty yesterday, that had been 
only trees and grass and old, 
grassed-over ditches, bordered by 
the wild plum thickets and the 
hazel brush and blackberry vine, 
rose the building. It seemed to 
him that it was bigger than when 
he had seen it less than an hour 
before. 

TJACK at the house, the newspapfermen were sitting in the 
yard, looking at the building. 

One of them said to him, "The 
brass arrived. They're waiting in 
there for you." 


 



"Intelligence?" asked Peter. 

The newsman nodded. "A 
chicken colonel and a major." 

They were waiting in the living 
room. The colonel was a young 
man with gray hair. The major 
wore a mustache, very military. 

The colonel introduced himself. "I'm Colonel Whitman. This 
is Major Rockwell." 

Peter put down his eggs and 
milk and nodded acknowledgment. 

"You found this machine," 
said the colonel. 
"That is right." 

"Tell us about it," said the 
colonel, so Peter told them about 
it. 

"This jade," the colonel said. 
"Could we have a look at it?" 

Peter went to the kitchen and 
got the jade. They passed it from 
one to the other, examining it 
closely, turning it over and over 
in their hands, a bit suspicious 
of it, but admiring it, although 
Peter could see they knew nothing about jade. 

Almost as if he might have 
known what was in Peter's mind, 
the colonel lifted his eyes from 
the jade and looked at him. 

"You know jade," the colonel 
said. 

"Very well," said Peter. 
"You've worked with it before?" 

"In a museum." 

"Tell me about yourself." * 



Peter hesitated — then told 
about himself. 

"But why are you here?" the 
colonel asked. 

"Have you ever been in a 
hospital. Colonel? Have you ever 
thought what it would be like 
to die there?" 

The colonel nodded. "I can see 
your point. But here you'll have 
no — " 

"I won't wait that long." 

"Yes, yes," the colonel said. "I 
see." — 

"Colonel," said, the major. 
"Look at this, sir, if you will. 
This symbolism is the same . . ." 

The colonel snatched it from 
his hands and looked. 

"The same as on the letterhead!" he shouted. 

The colonel lifted his head and 
stared at Peter, as if it had been 
the first time he had seen him, 
as if he were surprised at seeing 
him. 

There was, suddenly, a gun in 
the major's hand, pointing at 
Peter, its mu22le a cold and 
steady eye. 

Peter tried to throw himself 
aside. 

He was too late. 

The major shot him down. 

OETER fell for a million years 
through a wool-gray nothingness that screamed and he 
knew it must be a dream, an 
endless atavistic dream of falling, 



KINDERGARTEN 



25 



brought down through all the 
years from incredibly remote 
forebears who had dwelt in trees 
and had lived in fear of falling. 
He tried to pinch himself to 
awaken from the dream, but he 
couldn't do it, since he had no 
hands to pinch with, and, after a 
time, it became apparent that 
he had no body to pinch. He 
was a disembodied consciousness 
hurtling through a gulf which 
seemed to have no boundaries. 

He fell for a million years 
through the void that seemed to 
scream at him. At first the 
screaming soaked into him and 
filled his soul, since he had no 
body, with a terrible agony that 
went on and on, never quite 
reaching the breaking point that 
would send him into the release 
of insanity. But he got used to 
it after a time and as soon as 
he did, the screaming stopped 
and he plunged down through 
space in a silence that was more 
dreadful than the screaming. 

He fell forever and forever and 
then it seemed that forever ended, 
for he was at rest and no longer 
falling. 

He saw a face. It was a face 
from incredibly long ago, a face 
that he once had seen and had 
long forgotten, and he searched 
back along his memory to try to 
identify it. 

He couldn't see it too clearly, 
for it seemed to keep bobbing 



around so he couldn't pin it down. 
He tried and tried and couldn't 
and he closed his eyes to shut the 
face away. 

"Chaye," a voice said. "Peter 
Chaye." 

"Go away," said Peter. 

The voice went away. 

He opened his eyes again and 
the face was there, clearer now 
and no longer bobbing. 

It was the colonel's face. 

HE shut his eyes again, remembering the steady eye of 
the gun the major had held. He'd 
jumped aside, or tried to, and 
he had been too slow. Something 
had happened and he'd fallen for 
a million years and here he was, 
with the colonel looking at him. 

He'd been shot. That was the 
answer, of course. The major had 
shot him and he was in a hospital. But where had he been 
hit? Arm? Both arms seemed to 
be all right. Leg? Both legs 
were all right, too. No pain. No 
bandages. No casts. 

The colonel said: "He came to 
for just a minute, Doc, and now 
he's off again." 

"He'll be all right," said Doc. 
"Just give him time. You gave 
him too big a charge, that's all. 
It'll take a little time." 
"We must talk to him." 
"You'll have to wait." 
There was silence for a moment. 



26 




 



Then: "You're absolutely sure 
he's human?" 

"We've gone over every inch 
of him," said Doc. "If he isn't 
human, he's too good an imitation for us ever to find out." 

"He told me he had cancer,** 
the colonel said. "Claimed he was 
dying of cancer. Don't you see, 
if he wasn't human, if there was 
something wrong, he could always try to make it look . . ." 

"He hasn't any cancer. Not a 
sign of it. No sign he ever had it. 
No sign he ever will." 

"C^VEN with his eyes shut, Peter 
felt that he was agape with 
disbelief and amazement. He 
forced his eyes to stay closed, 
afraid that this was a trick. 

"That other doctor," the colonel said, "told Peter Chaye four 
months ago he had six more 
months to live. He told him . . ." 

Doc said, "Colonel, I won't 
even try to explain it. All I can 
tell you is that the man lying 
on that bed hasn't got cancer. 
He's as healthy a man as you 
would wish to find." 

"It isn't Peter Chaye, then," 
the colonel stated in a dogged 
voice. "It's something that took 
over. Peter Chaye or duplicated 
Peter Chaye or . . 

Doc said, "Now, now, Colonel. 
Let's stick to what we know." 

"You're sure he's a man, Doc?" 

"I'm sure he's a human being, 



if that is what you mean." 

"No little differences? Just one 
seemingly unimportant deviation 
from the human norm?" 

"None," Doc said, "and even if 
there were, it wouldn't prove what 
you are after. There could be 
minor mutational difference in 
anyone. The human body doesn't 
always run according to a blueprint." 

"There were differences in all 
that stuff the machine gave away. 
Little differences that came to 
light only on close examination — 
but differences that spelled out a 
margin between human and alien 
manufacture.** 

"All right, then, so there were 
differences. So those things were 
made by aliens. I still tell you 
this man is a human being." 

"It all ties in so neatly,'* the 
colonel declared. "Chaye goes out 
and buys this . place — this old, 
abandoned farm. He's eccentric 
as hell by the standards of that 
neighborhood. By the very fact 
of his eccentricity, he invites attention, which might be undesirable, but at the same time his 
eccentricity might be used to 
cover up and smooth over anything he did out of the ordinary. 
It would be just somebody like 
him who'd supposedly find a 
strange machine. It would be . . , M 

"You're building up a case,*' 
said Doc, "without anything to 
go on. You asked for one little 



KINDERGARTEN 



difference in him to base your 
cockeyed theory on — no offense, 
but that's how I, as a doctor, see 
it. Well, now let's have one little 
fact — fact, mind you, not guess — 
to support this idea of yours." 

"What was in that barn?" demanded the colonel. "That's 
what I want to know. Did Chaye 
build that machine in there? Was 
that why it was destroyed?" 

"The sheriff destroyed the 
barn," the doctor said. "Chaye 
had nothing to do with it." 

"But who gave the gun to the 
sheriff? Chaye's machine, that's 
who. And it would be an easy 
matter of suggestion, mind control, hypnotism, whatever you 
want to call it . . ." 

"Let's get back to facts. You 
used an anesthetic gun on this 
man. You've held him prisoner. 
By your orders, he has been subjected to intensive examination, 
a clear invasion of his privacy. 
I hope to God he never brings 
you into court. He could throw 
the book at you." 
v "I know," the colonel admitted 
reluctantly. "But we have to bust 
this thing. We must find out what 
it is. We have got to get that 
bomb back!" 

"The bomb's what worries 
you." 

"Hanging up there," the colonel said, sounding as if he'd 
shuddered. "Just hanging up 
there!" 



"I have to get along," replied 
the doctor. "Take it easy, Colonel." 

rriHE doctor's footsteps went 
out the door and down the 
corridor, fading away. The colonel paced up and down a while 
and then sat down heavily in a 
chair. 

Peter lay in bed, and one 
thought crashed through his 
brain, one thought again and 
again: 

Vm going to live! 

But he hadn't been. 

He had been ready for the day 
when the pain finally became too 
great to bear. 

He had picked his ground to 
spend his final days, to make his 
final stand. 

And now he had been reprieved. Now, somehow, he had 
been given back his life. 

He lay in the bed, fighting 
against excitement, against a 
growing tenseness, trying to 
maintain the pretense that he still 
was under the influence of whatever he'd been shot with. 

An anesthetic gun, the doctor 
had said. Something new, something he had never heard of. 
And yet somewhere there was a 
hint of it. Something, he remembered, about dentistry — a new 
technique that dentists used to 
desensitize the gums, a fine stream 
of anesthetic sprayed against the 



26 




 



gums. Something like that, only 
hundreds or thousands of times 
stronger? 

Shot and brought here and examined because of some wild 
fantasy lurking in the mind of a 
G-2 colonel. 

Fantasy? He wondered. Unwitting, unsuspecting, could he 
have played a part? It was ridiculous, of course. For he remembered nothing he had done or 
said or even thought which gave 
him a clue to any part he might 
have played in the machine*s 
coming to the Earth. 

Could cancer be something 
other than disease? Some uninvited guest, perhaps, that came 
and lived within a human body? 
A clever alien guest who came 
from far away, across the unguessed light-years? 

And that, he knew, was fantasy to match the colonel's 
fantasy, a malignant nightmare 
of distrust that dwelt within the 
human mind, an instinctive defense mechanism that conditioned 
the race to expect the worst and 
to arm against it. 

There was nothing feared so 
much as the unknown factor, 
nothing which one must guard 
against so much as the unexplained. 

We have to bust this thing, the 
colonel had said. We must find 
out what it is. 

And, that, of course, was the 



terror of it— that they had no 
way of knowing what it was. 

HE stirred at last, very deliberately, and the colonel 
spoke. 

"Peter Chaye," he said. 

"Yes, what is it, Colonel?" 

"I have to talk to you." 

"All right, talk to me." 

He sat up in the bed and saw 
that he was in a hospital room. 
It had the stark, antiseptic quality, the tile floor, the colorless 
walls, the utilitarian look — and 
the bed on which he lay was a 
hospital bed. 

"How do you feel?" the colonel 
asked. 

"Not so hot," confessed Peter. 

"We were a little rough on you, 
but we couldn't take a chance. 
There was the letter, you see, and 
the slot machines and the stamp 
machines and all the other things 
and . . ." 

"You said something about a letterhead." 

"What do you know about 
that, Chaye?" 

"I don't know a thing." 

"It ' came to the President," 
said the colonel. "A month or so 
ago. And a similar one went to 
every other administrative head 
on the entire Earth." 
"Saying?" 

"That's the hell of it. It was 
written in no language known 
anywhere on Earth. But there 



KINDERGARTEN 



29 



was one line — one line on all the 
letters — that you could read. It 
said : 'By the time you have this 
deciphered, you'll be ready to act 
logically.' And that was all anybody could read — one line in the 
native language of every country 
that got a copy of the letter. 
The rest was in gibberish, for all 
we could make of it." 

"You haven't deciphered it?" 

He could see the colonel sweating. "Not even a single character, 
much less a word." 

Peter reached out a hand to 
the bedside table and lifted the 
carafe, tipped it above the glass. 
There was nothing in it. 


 




The colonel heaved himself 
out of his chair. "I'll get you a 
drink of water." 

He picked up the glass and 
opened the bathroom door. 

"I'll let it run a while and get 
it cold," he said. 

But Peter scarcely heard -him, 
for he was staring at the door. 
There was a bolt on it and if — 

The water started running and 
the colonel raised his voice to be 
heard above it. 

"That's about the time we 
started finding the machines," 
he said. "Can you imagine it? 
A cigarette-vending machine and 
you could buy cigarettes from it, 



but it was more than that. It was 
something watching you. Something that studied the people and 
the way they lived. And the 
stamp machines and the slot machines and all the other mechanical contrivances that we have 
set up. Not machines, but watchers. Watching all the time. 
Watching and learning . . ." 

PETER swung his legs out of 
bed and touched the floor. He 
approached swiftly and silently 
on bare feet and slammed the 
door, then reached up and slid 
the bolt. It snicked neatly into 
place. 

"Hey!" the colonel shouted. 
Clothes? 

They might be in the closet. 

Peter leaped at it and wrenched 
the door open and there they 
were, hung upon the hangers. 

He ripped off the hospital 
gown, snatched at his trousers and 
pulled them on. 

Shirt, now! In a drawer. 

And shoes? There on the closet 
floor. Don't take time to tie them. 

The colonel was pushing and 
hammering at the door, not yelling yet. Later he would, but right 
now he was intent on saving all 
the face he could. He wouldn't 
want to advertise immediately 
the fact that he'd been tricked. 

Peter felt through his pockets. 
His wallet was gone. So was 
everything else — his knife, his 



KINDERGARTEN 



31 



watch, his keys. More than likely 
they'd taken all of it and put it 
in the office safe when he'd been 
brought in. 

No time to worry about any of 
them. The thing now was to get 
away. 

He went out the door and down 
the corridor, carefully not going 
too fast. He passed a nurse, but 
she scarcely glanced at him. 

He found a stairway door and 
opened it. Now he could hurry 
just a little more. He went down 
the stairs three at a time, shoelaces clattering. 

The stairs, he told himself, 
were fairly safe. Almost no one 
would use them when there were 
the elevators. He stopped and 
bent over for a moment and tied 
the laces. 

The floor numbers were painted 
above each of the doors, so he 
knew where he was. At the 
ground floor, he entered the corridor again. So far, there seemed 
to be no alarms, although any 
minute now the colonel would 
start to raise a ruckus. 

Would they try to stop him at 
the door? Would there be someone to question him? Would — 

A basket of flowers stood beside a door. He glanced up and 
down the corridor. There were 
several people, but they weren't 
looking at him. He scooped up 
the flowers. 

At the door, he said to the at


tendant who sat behind the desk: 
"Mistake. Wrong flowers." 

She smiled sourly, but made 
no move to stop him. 

Outside, he put the flowers 
down on the steps and walked 
rapidly away. 

An hour later, he knew that he 
was safe. He knew also that he 
was in a city thirty miles away 
from where he wanted to go and 
that he had no money and that 
he was hungry and his feet were 
sore from walking on the hard 
and unyielding concrete of the 
sidewalks. 

He found a park and sat down 
on a bench. A little distance 
away, a group of old men were 
playing checkers at a table. A 
mother wheeled her baby. A 
young man sat on a nearby 
bench, listening to a tiny radio. 

'"pHE radio said: ", . . apparently the building is completed. 
There has been no sign of it 
growing for the last eighteen 
hours. At the moment, it measures a thousand stories high and 
covers more than a hundred 
acres. The bomb, which was 
dropped two days ago, still floats 
there above it, held in suspension 
by some strange force. Artillery 
is standing by, waiting for the 
word to fire, but the word has 
not come through. Many think 
that since the bomb could not 
get through, shells will have no 



32 




 



better chance, if any at all. 

"A military spokesman, in fact, 
has said that the big guns are 
mere precautionary measures, 
which may be all right, but it 
certainly doesn't explain why the 
bomb was dropped. There is a 
rising clamor, not only in Congress, but throughout the world, 
to determine why an attempt was 
made at bombing. There has as 
yet been no hostile move directed 
from the building. The only damage so far reported has been the 
engulf ment by the building of 
the farm home of Peter Chaye, 
the man who found the machine. 

"All trace has been lost of 
Chaye since three days ago, when 
he suffered an attack of some sort 
and was taken from his home. It 
is believed that he may be in 
military custody. There is wide 
speculation on what Chaye may 
or may not know. It is entirely 
likely that he is the only man 
on Earth who can shed any light 
on what has happened on his 
farm. 

"Meanwhile, the military guard 
has been tightened around the 
scene and a corridor of some 
eighteen miles in depth around 
it has been evacuated. It is known 
that two delegations of scientists 
have been escorted through the 
lines. While no official announcement has been made, there is 
good reason to believe they 
learned little from their visits. 



What the building is, who or 
what has engineered its construction, if you can call the insideout process by which it grew construction, or what may be expected next are all fields of 
groundless speculation. There is 
plenty of that, naturally, but no 
one has yet come up with what 
might be called an explanation. 

"The world's press wires are 
continuing to pile up reams of 
copy, but even so there is little 
actual, concrete knowledge — few 
facts that can be listed one, two, 
three right down the line. 

"There is little other news of 
any sort and perhaps it's just as 
well, since there is no room at 
the moment in the public interest for anything else but this 
mysterious building. Strangely , 
however, there is little other news. 
As so often happens when big 
news breaks, all other events 
seem to wait for some other 
time to happen. The polio epidemic is rapidly subsiding; there 
is no major crime news. In the 
world's capitals, of course, all 
legislative action is /at a complete standstill, with the governments watching closely the 
developments at the building. 

"There is a rising feeling at 
many of these capitals that the 
building is not of mere national 
concern, that decisions regarding it must be made at an international level. The attempted 



KINDERGARTEN 



tombing has resulted in some 
argument that we, as the nation 
most concerned, cannot be trusted 
to act in a calm, dispassionate 
way, and that an objective world 
viewpoint is necessary for an intelligent handling of the situation." 

PETER got up from his bench 
and walked away. He'd been 
taken from his home three days 
ago, the radio had said. No 
wonder he was starved. 

Three days — and in that time 
the building had grown a thousand stories high and now covered a hundred acres. 

He went along, not hurrying 
too much now, his feet a heavy 
ache, his belly pinched with 
hunger. 

He had to get back to the 
building — somehow he had to get 
back there. It was a sudden need, 
realized and admitted now, but 
the reason for it, the source of it, 
was not yet apparent. It was as 
if there had been something he 
had left behind and he had to go 
and find it* Something I left behind, he thought. What could he 
have left behind ? Nothing but 
the pain and the knowledge that 
he walked with a dark companion 
and the little capsule that he 
carried in his pocket for the time 
when the pain grew too great. 

He felt in his pocket and the 
capsule was no longer there. It 



had disappeared along with his 
wallet and his pocket knife and 
watch. No matter now, he 
thought. I no longer need the 
capsule. 

He heard the hurrying footsteps behind him and there was 
an urgency about them that 
made him swing around. 

"Peter!" Mary cried out. 
"Peter, I thought I recognized 
you. I was hurrying to catch 
you." 

He stood and looked at her as 
if he did not quite believe it was 
she whom he saw. 

"Where have you been?" she 
asked. 

"Hospital," Peter said. "I ran 
away from them. But you . . ." 

"We were evacuated, Peter. 
They came and told us that we 
had to leave. Some of us are 
at a camp down at the other end 
of the park. Pa is carrying on 
something awful and I can't 
blame him — having to leave right 
in the middle of haying and with 
the small grain almost ready to 
be cut." 

She tilted back her head and 
looked into his face. 

"You look all worn out," she 
said. "Is it worse again?" 

"It?" he asked, then realized 
that the neighbors must have 
known — that the reason for his 
coming to the farm must have 
been general knowledge, for there 
were no such things as secrets in 




 



a farming neighborhood. 

"I'm sorry, Peter," Mary said. 
"Terribly sorry. I shouldn't 
have . . .*' 

"It's all "right," said Peter. 
"Because it's gone now, Mary. I 
haven't got it any more. I don't 
know how or why, but I've gotten rid of it in some way." 

"The hospital?" she suggested. 

"The hospital had nothing to 
do with it. It had cleared up before I went there. They just 
found out at the hospital, that is 
all." 

"Maybe the diagnosis was 
wrong." 

He shook his head. "It wasn't 
wrong, Mary." 

STILL, how could he be sure? 
How could he, or the medical 
world, say positively that it had 
been malignant cells and not 
something else — some strange 
parasite to which he had played 
the unsuspecting host? 

"You said you ran away," she 
reminded him. 

"They'll be looking for me, 
Mary. The colonel and the major. 
They think I had something to 
do with the machine I found. 
They think I might have made 
it. They took me to the hospital 
to find out if I was human." 
"Of all the silly things!" 
"I've got to get back to the 
farm,'* he said. "I simply have to 
get back there." 



"You can't," she told him. 
"There are soldiers everywhere." 

"I'll crawl on my belly in the 
ditches, if I have to. Travel at 
night. Sneak through the lines. 
Fight if I'm discovered and they 
try to prevent me. There is no 
alternative. I have to make a 
try." 

"You're ill," she said, anxiously staring at his face. 

He grinned at her. "Not ill. 
Just hungry." 

"Come On then." She took his 
arm. 

He held back. "Not to the 
camp. I can't have someone seeing me. In just a little while, I'll 
be a hunted man — if I'm not one 
already." 

"A restaurant, of course." 

"They took my wallet, Mary. 
I haven't any money." 

"I have shopping money." 

"No," he said. "I'll get along. 
There's nothing that can beat 
me now." 

"You really mean that, don't 
you?" 

"It just occurred to me," Peter 
admitted, confused and yet somehow sure that what he had said 
was not reckless bravado, but a 
blunt fact. 

"You're going back?" 

"I have to, Mary." 

"And you think you have a 
chance?" 

He nodded. 

"Peter," she began hesitantly. 



KINDERGARTEN 



"Yes?" 

"How much bother would I 

be?" 

"You ? How do you mean ? 
A bother in what way?" 

"If I went along." 

"But you can't. There's no 
reason for you to." 

She lifted her chin just a 
little. "There is a reason, Peter. 
Almost as if I were being called 
there. Like a bell ringing in my 
head — a school bell calling in the 
children . . ." 

"Mary," he said, "that perfume 
bottle — there was a certain symbol on it, wasn't there?" 

"Carved in the glass," she told 
him. "The same symbol, Peter, 
that was carved into the jade." 

And the same symbol, he 
thought, that had been on the 
letterheads. 

"Come on," he decided suddenly. "You won't be any bother." 

"We'll eat first," she said. "We 
can use the shopping money." 

npHEY walked down the path, 
hand in hand, like two teenage sweethearts. 

"We have lots of time," said 
Peter. "We can't start for home 
till dark." 

They ate at a small restaurant 
on an obscure street and after 
that went grocery shopping. They 
bought a loaf of bread and two 
rings of bologna and a slab of 
cheese, which took all of Mary's 

36 



money, and for the change the 
grocer sold them an empty bottle 
in which to carry water. It would 
serve as a canteen. 

They walked to the edge of the 
city and out through the suburbs 
and into the open country, not 
traveling fast, for there was no 
point in trying to go too far 
before night set in. 

They found a stream and sat 
beside it, for all the world like 
a couple on a picnic. Mary took 
off her shoes and dabbled her feet 
in the water and the two of them 
felt disproportionately happy. 

Night came and they Started 
out. There was no Moon, but the 
sky was ablaze with stars. Although they took some tumbles 
and at other times wondered 
where they were, they kept moving on, staying off the roads, 
walking through the fields and 
pastures, skirting the farm houses 
to avoid barking dogs. 

It was shortly after midnight 
that they saw the first of the 
campfires and swung wide around 
them. From the top of a ridge, 
they looked down upon the camp 
and saw the outlines of tents and 
the dull shapes of the canvascovered trucks. And, later on, 
they almost stumbled into an 
artillery outfit, but got safely 
away without encountering the 
sentries who were certain to be 
stationed around the perimeter 
of the bivouac. 


 



Now they knew that they were 
inside the evacuated area, that 
they were moving through the 
outer ring of soldiers and guns 
which hemmed in the building. 

They moved more cautiously 
and made slower time. When the 
first false light of dawn came into 
the east, they holed up in a 
dense plum thicket in the corner 
of a pasture. 

"I'm tired," sighed Mary. "I 
wasn't tired all night or, if I 
was, I didn't know it — but now 
that we've stopped, I feel exhausted." 

"We'll eat and sleep," Peter 
said. 

"Sleep comes first. I'm too 
tired to eat." 

Peter left her and crawled 
through the thicket to its edge. 

IN the growing light of morning stood the Building, a great 
blue -misted mass that reared 
above the horizon like a blunted 
finger pointing at the sky. 

"Mary!" Peter whispered. 
"Mary, there it is!" 

He heard her crawling through 
the thicket to his side. 

"Peter, it's a long way off." 

"Yes, I know it is. But we are 
going there," 

They crouched there watching 

it. 

"I can't see the bomb," said 
Mary. "The bomb that's hanging over it." 



"It's too far off to see." 

"Why is it us? Why are we the 
ones who are going back? Why 
are we the only ones who are not 
afraid?" 

"I don't know," said Peter, 
frowning puzzledly. "No actual 
reason, that is. I'm going back 
because I want to — no, because 
I have to. You see, it was the 
place I chose. The dying place. 
Like the elephants crawling off 
to die where all other elephants 
die." 

"But you're all right now, 
Peter." 

"That makes no difference — 
or it doesn't seem to. It was 
where I found peace and an understanding." 

"And there were the symbols, 
Peter. The symbols on the bottle 
and the jade." 

"Let's go back," he said. 
"Someone will spot us here." 

"Our gifts were the only ones 
that had the symbols," Mary persisted. "None of the others had 
any of them. I asked around. 
There were no symbols at all on 
the other gifts." 

"There's no time to wonder 
about that. Come on." 

They crawled back to the center of the thicket. 

The Sun had risen above the 
horizon now and sent level shafts 
of light into the thicket and 
the early morning silence hung 
over them like a benediction.

"Peter," said Mary, "I just 
can't stay awake any longer. Kiss 
me before I go to sleep." 

He kissed her and they clung 
together, shut from the world by 
the .jagged, twisted, low-growing 
branches of the plum trees. 

"I hear the bells," she breathed. 
"Do you hear them, too?" 

Peter shook his head. 

"Like school bells," she said. 
"Like bells on the first day of 
.school — the first day you ever 
went." 

"You're tired," he told her. 

"I've heard them before. This 
is not the first time." 

He kissed her again. "Go to 
sleep," he said and she did, almost as soon as she lay down 
and closed her eyes. 

He sat quietly beside her and 
his mind retreated to his own 
hidden depths, searching for the 
pain within him. But there was 
no pain. It was gone forever. 

The pain was gone and the incidence of polio was down and 
it was a crazy thing to think, 
but he thought it, anyhow: v 

Missionary! 

7" HEN human missionaries 
went out to heathen lands, 
what were the first things that 
they did? 

They preached, of course, but 
there were other things as well. 
They fought disease and they 
worked for sanitation and labored 

38 



to improve the welfare of the 
people and tried to educate them 
to a better way of life. And in 
this way they not only carried 
out their religious precepts, but 
gained the confidence of the 
heathen folk as well. 

And if an alien missionary 
came to Earth, what would be 
among the first things that he 
was sure to do? Would it not be 
reasonable that he, too, would 
fight disease and try to improve 
the welfare of his chosen charges? 
Thus he would gain their confidence. Although he could not 
expect to gain too much at first. 
He could expect hostility and 
suspicion. Only a pitiful handful 
would not resent him or be 
afraid of him. 

And if the missionary — 

And if THIS missionary — 

Peter fell asleep. 

The roar awakened him and 
he sat upright, sleep entirely 
wiped from his mind. 

The roar still was there, somewhere outside the thicket, but it 
was receding. 

"Peter! Peter!" 

"Quiet, Mary! There is something out there!" 

The roar turned around and 
came back again, growing until 
it was the sound of clanking 
thunder and the Earth shook with 
the sound. It receded again. 

The midday sunlight came 
down through the branches and 



made of their hiding place a 
freckled spot of Sun and shade. 
Peter could smell the musky 
odor of warm soil and wilted leaf. 

They crept cautiously through 
the thicket and when they gained 
its edge, where the leaves thinned 
out, they saw the racing tank far 
down the field. Its roar came to 
them as it tore along, bouncing 
and swaying to the ground's 
unevenness, the great snout of 
its cannon pugnaciously thrust 
out before it, like a stiff -arming 
football player. 

A road ran clear down the field 
— a road that Peter was sure had 
not been there the night before. 
It was a straight road, absolutely 
straight, running toward the 
building, and it was of some 
metallic stuff that shimmered in 
the Sun. 

And far off to the left was another road and to the right another, and in the distance the 
three roads seemed to draw together, as the rails seem to converge when one looks down a 
railroad track. 

Other roads running at right 
angles cut across the three roads, 
intersecting them so that one 
gained the impression of three 
far-reaching ladders set tightly 
side by side. 

*TpHE tank raced toward one of 
the intersecting roads, a tank 
made midget by the distance, 



and its roar came back to them 
no louder than the humming of 
an angry bee. 

It reached the road and skidded 
off, whipping around sidewise and 
slewing along, as if it had hit 
something smooth and solid that 
it could not get through, as if 
it might have struck a soaped 
metallic wall. There was a moment when it tipped and almost 
went over, but it stayed upright 
and finally backed away, then 
swung around to come lumbering 
down the field, returning toward 
the thicket. 

Halfway down the field, it 
pivoted around and halted, so 
that the gun pointed back toward 
the intersecting road. 

The gun's muzzle moved downward and flashed and, at the intersecting road, the shell exploded 
with a burst of light and a puff 
of smoke. The concussion of the 
shot slapped hard against the 
ear. 

Again and again the gun 
belched out its shells pointblank. 
A haze of smoke hung above the 
tank and road — and the shells 
still exploded at the road — this 
side of the road and not beyond 
it. 

The tank clanked forward once 
more until it reached the road. 
It approached carefully this time 
and nudged itself along, as if 
it might be looking for a way to 
cross.

From somewhere a long distance off came the crunching 
sound of artillery. An entire battery of guns seemed to be firing. 
They fired for a while, then 
grudgingly quit. 

The tank still nosed along the 
road like a dog sniffing beneath 
a fallen tree for a hidden rabbit. 

"There's something there that's 
stopping them," said Peter. 

"A wall," Mary guessed. "An 
invisible wall of some sort, but 
one they can't get through." 

"Or shoot through, either. They 
tried to break through with gunfire and they didn't even dent it." 

He crouched there, watching as 
the tank nosed along the road. It 
reached the point where the road 
to the left came down to intersect 
the crossroad. The tank sheered 
off to follow the left-hand one, 
bumping along with its forward 
armor shoved against the unseen 
wall. 

Boxed in, thought Peter — those 
roads have broken up and boxed 
in all the military units. A tank 
in one pen and a dozen tanks in 
another, a battery of artillery 
in another, the motor pool in yet 
another. Boxed in and trapped; 
penned up and useless. 

And we, he wondered — are we 
boxed in as well? 

A group of soldiers came 
tramping down the right-hand 
road. Peter spotted them from 
far off, black dots moving down 



the road, heading east, away 
from the building. When they 
came closer, he saw that they 
carried no guns and slogged along 
without the slightest semblance 
of formation and he could see 
from the way they walked that 
they were dog-tired. 

TTE had not been aware that 
Mary had left his side until 
she came creeping back again, 
ducking her head to keep her 
hair from being caught in the lowhanging branches. 

She sat down beside him and 
handed him a thick slice of bread 
and a chunk of bologna. She set 
the bottle of water down between 
them. 

"It was the building," she said, 
"that built the roads." 

Peter nodded, his mouth full 
of bread and meat. 

"They want to make it easy 
to get to the building," Mary 
said. "The building wants to 
make it easy for people to come 
and visit it." 

"The bells again?" he asked. 

She smiled and said, "The 
bells." 

The soldiers now had come 
close enough to see the tank. 
They stopped and stood in the 
road, looking at it. 

Then four of them turned off 
the road and walked out into the 
field, heading for the tank. The 
others sat down and waited.

"The wall only works one 
way," said Mary. 

"More likely," Peter told her, 
"it works for tanks, but doesn't 
work for people." 

"The building doesn't want to 
keep the people out.'* 

The soldiers crossed the Seld 
and the tank came out to meet 
them. It stopped and the crew 
crawled out of it and climbed 
down. The soldiers and the crew 
stood talking and one of the 
soldiers kept swinging his arms in 
gestures, pointing here and there. 

From far away came the sound 
of heavy guns again. 

"Some of them," said Peter, 
"still are trying to blast down the 
walls." 

Finally the soldiers and the 
tank crew walked back to the 
road, leaving the tank deserted in 
the field. 

And that must be the way it 
was with the entire military force 
which had hemmed in the building, Peter told himself. The roads 
and walls had cut it into bits, 
had screened it off — and now the 
tanks and the big guns and the 
planes were just so many ineffective toys of an infant race, 
lying scattered in a thousand 
playpens. 

Out on the road, the foot 
soldiers and the tank crew slogged 
eastward, retreating from the 
siege which had failed so ingloriously. 



IN their thicket, Mary and Peter 
sat and watched the Building. 

"You said they came from the 
stars," said Mary. "But why did 
they come here? Why did they 
bother with us? Why did they 
come at all?" 

"To save us," Peter offered 
slowly. "To save us from ourselves. Or to exploit and enslave 
us. Or to use our planet as a 
military base. For any one of 
a hundred reasons. Maybe for a 
reason we couldn't understand 
even if they told us." 

"You don't believe those other 
reasons, the ones about enslaving 
us or using Earth as a military 
base. If you believed that, we 
wouldn't be going to the building." 

"No, I don't believe them. I 
don't because I had cancer and 
I haven't any longer. I don't because the polio began clearing 
up on the same day that they arrived. They're doing good for us, 
exactly the same as the missionaries did good among the primitive, disease-ridden people to 
whom they were assigned. I 
hope — " 

He sat and stared across the 
field, at the trapped and deserted 
tank, at the shining ladder of the 
roads. 

"I hope," he said, "they don't 
do what some of the missionaries 
did. I hope they don't destroy 
our self-respect with alien Mother

Hubbards. I hope they don't 
save us from ringworm and condemn us to a feeling of racial 
inferiority. I hope they don't chop 
down the coconuts and hand 
us — " 

But they know about us, he 
told himself. They know all there 
is to know. They've studied us 
for — -how long? Squatting in a 
drugstore corner, masquerading 
as a Cigarette machine. Watching us from the counter in the 
guise of stamp machine. 

And they wrote letters — letters 
to every head of state in all the 
world. Letters that might, when 
finally deciphered, explain what 
they were about. Or that might 
make certain demands. Or that 
might, just possibly, be no more 
than applications for permits to 
build a mission or a church or a 
hospital or a school. 

They know us, he thought. 
They know, for example, that 
we're suckers for anything that's 
free, so they handed out free 
gifts — just like the quiz shows 
and contests run by radio and 
television and Chambers of Commerce, except that there was no 
competition and everybody won. 

Throughout the afternoon, 
Peter and Mary watched the road 
and during that time small groups 
of soldiers had come limping 
down it. But now, for an hour or 
more, there had been no one on 
the road. 



THEY started out just before 
dark, walking across the field, 
passing through the wall-thatwasn't-there to reach the road. 
And they headed west along the 
road, going toward the purple 
cloud of the building that reared 
against the redness of the sunset. 

They traveled through the 
night and they did not have to 
dodge and hide, as they had that 
first night, for there was no one 
on the road except the one lone 
soldier they met. 

By the time they saw him, they 
had come far enough so that the 
great shaft of the building loomed halfway up the sky, a smudge 
of misty brightness in the bright 
starlight. 

The soldier was sitting in the 
middle of the road and he'd 
taken off his shoes and set them 
neatly beside him. 

"My feet are killing me," he 
said by way of greeting. 

So they sat down with him to 
keep him company and Peter 
took out the water bottle and the 
loaf of bread and the cheese and 
bologna and spread them on the 
pavement with wrapping paper 
as a picnic cloth. 

They ate in silence for a while 
and finally the soldier said, "Well, 
this is the end of it." 

They did not ask the question, 
but waited patiently, eating 
bread and cheese. 

"This is the end of soldiering," 



42 




 



the soldier told them. "This is 
the end of war." 

He gestured out toward the 
pens fashioned by the roads and 
in one nearby pen were three 
self - propelled artillery pieces 
and in another was an ammunition dump and another pen held 
military vehicles. 

"How are you going to fight a 
war," the soldier asked, "if the 
things back there can chop up 
your armies into checkerboards? 
A tank ain't worth a damn guarding ten acres, not when it isn't 
able to get out of those ten acres. 
A big gun ain't any good to you 
if you can't fire but half a mile." 

"You think they would?" asked Mary. "Anywhere, I mean?" 

"They done it here. Why not 
somewhere else? Why not any 
place that they wanted to? They 
stopped us. They stopped us cold 
and they never shed a single drop 
of blood. Not a casualty among 
us." 

He swallowed the bit of bread 
and cheese that was in his mouth 
and reached for the water bottle. 
He drank, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down. 

"I'm coming back," he said. 
"I'm going out and get my girl 
and we both are coming back. 
The things in that building maybe need some help and I'm going 
to help them if there's a way of 
doing it. And if they don't need 
no help, why, then I'm going to 



figure out some way to let them 
know I'm thankful that they 
came." 

"Things? You saw some 
things?" 

The soldier stared at Peter. 
"No, I never saw anything at all." 

"But this business of going out 
to get your girl and both of you 
coming back? How did you get 
that idea? Why not go back right 
now with us?" 

"It wouldn't be right," the soldier protested. "Or it doesn't 
seem just right. I got to see her 
first and tell her how I feel. Besides, I got a present for her." 

"She'll be glad to see you," 
Mary told him softly. "She'll like 
the present." 

"She sure will." The soldier 
grinned proudly. "It was something that she wanted." 

TTE reached in his pocket and 
took out a leather box. Fumbling with the catch, he snapped 
it open. The starlight blazed softly on the necklace that lay inside the box. 

Mary reached out her hand. 
"May I?" she asked. 

"Sure," the soldier said. "I 
want you to take a look at it. 
You'd know if a girl would like 
it." 

Mary lifted it from the box 
and held it in her hand, a stream 
of starlit fire. 

"Diamonds?" asked Peter.

"i don't know," the soldier 
said. "Might be. It looks real expensive. There's a pendant, sort 
of, at the bottom of it, of green 
stone that doesn't sparkle much, 
but — " 

"Pete r," Mary interrupted, 
"have you got a match?" 

The soldier dipped his hand 
into a pocket. "I got a lighter, 
miss. That thing gave me a lighter. A beaut!" 

He snapped it open and the 
blaze flamed out. Mary held the 
pendant close. 

"It's the symbol," she said. 
"Just like on my bottle of perfume." 

"That carving?" asked the soldier, pointing. "It's on the lighter, 
too." 

"Something gave you this?" 
Peter urgently wanted to know. 

"A box. Except that it really 
was more than a box. I reached 
down to put my hand on it and 
it coughed up a lighter and when 
it did, I thought of Louise and 
the lighter she had given me. I'd 






lost it and I felt bad about it, 
and here was one just like it except for the carving on the side. 
And when I thought of Louise, 
the box made a funny noise and 
out popped the box with the 
necklace in it." 

The soldier leaned forward, his 
young 'face solemn in the glow 
from the lighter's flame. 

"You know what I think?" he 
said. "I think that box was one 
of them. There are stories, but 
you can't believe everything you 
hear . . 

He looked from one to the 
other of them. "You don't laugh 
at me," he remarked wonderingly. 

Peter shook his head. "That's 
about the last thing we'd do, Soldier." 

Mary handed back the necklace and the lighter. The soldier 
put them in his pocket and began putting on his shoes. 

"I got to get on," he said. 
"Thanks for the chow." 

"We'll be seeing you," said 
Peter.

"I hope so." 

"I know we will," Mary stated 
positively. 

They watched him trudge 
away, then walked on in the 
other direction. 

jifARY said to Peter, "The 
symbol is the mark of them. 
The ones who get the symbol are 
the ones who will go back. It's a 
passport, a seal of approval." 

"Or," Peter amended, "the 
brand of ownership." 

"They'd be looking for certain 
kinds of people. They wouldn*t 
want anybody who was afraid of 
them. They'd want people who 
had some faith in them." 

"What do they want us for?" 
Peter fretted. "That's what bothers me. What use can we be to 
them? The soldier wants to help 
them, but they don't need 
help from us. They don't need 
help from anyone." 

"We've never seen one of 
them," said Mary. "Unless the 
box was one of them." 

And the cigarette machines, 
thought Peter. The cigarette machines and God knows what else. 

"And yet," said Mary, "they 
know about us. They've watched 
us and studied us. They know us 
inside out. They can reach deep 
within us and know what each of 
might want and then give it to 
us. A rod and reel for Johnny 
and a piece of jade for you. And 

46 l 



the rod and reel were a human 
rod and reel and the jade was 
Earth jade. They even know 
about the soldier's girl. They 
knew she would like a shiny 
necklace and they knew she was 
the kind of person that they 
wanted to come back again and 

"The Saucers," Peter said. "I 
wonder if it was the Saucers, 
after all, watching us for years, 
learning all about us." 

How many years would it take, 
he wondered, from a standing 
start, to learn all there was to 
know about the human race? For 
it would be from a standing start ; 
to them, all of humanity would 
have been a complex alien race 
and they would have had to feel 
their way along, learning one fact 
here and another there. And they 
would make mistakes; at times 
their deductions would be wrong, 
and that would set them back. 

"I don't know," said Peter. "I 
can't figure it out at all." 

They walked down the shiny 
metal road that glimmered in 
the starlight, with the building 
growing from a misty phantom 
to a gigantic wall that rose against 
the sky to blot out the stars. A 
thousand stories high and coveri ing more than a hundred acres, 
it was a structure that craned 
i your head and set your neck to 
aching and made your brain spin 
I with its glory and its majesty. 


 



And even when you drew near 
it, you could not see the dropped 
and cradled bomb, resting in the 
emptiness above it, for the bomb 
was too far away for seeing. 

But you could see the little 
cubicles sliced off by the roads 
and, within the cubicles, the destructive toys of a violent race, 
deserted now, just idle hunks of 
fashioned metal. 

*T*HEY came at last, just before 
dawn, to the great stairs that 
ran up to the central door. As 
they moved across the flat stone 
approach to the stairs, they felt 
the hush and the deepness of the 
peace that lay in the building's 
shadow. 

Hand in hand, they went up 
the stairs and came to the great 
bronze door and there they stopped. Turning around, they looked back in silence. 

The roads spun out like wheel 
spokes from the building's hub 
as far as they could see, and the 
crossing roads ran in concentric 
circles so that it seemed they 
stood in the center of a spider's 
web. 

Deserted farm houses, with 
their groups of buildings — barns, 
granaries, garages, silos, hog pens, 
machine sheds — stood in the sectors marked off by the roads, and 
in other sectors lay the machines 
of war, fit now for little more 
than birds' nests or a hiding 



place for rabbits. Bird songs came 
trilling up from the pastures and 
the fields and you could smell 
the freshness and the coolness 
of the countryside. 

"It's good," said Mary. "Ifs 
our country, Peter." 

"It was our country," Peter 
corrected her. "Nothing will ever 
be quite the same again." 

"You aren't afraid, Peter?" 

"Not a bit. Just baffled." 

"But you seemed so sure before." 

"I still am sure," he said. 
"Emotionally, I am as sure as 
ever that everything's all right." 

"Of course everything's all 
right. There was a polio epidemic 
and now it has died out. An army 
has been routed without a single 
death. An atomic bomb was 
caught and halted before it could 
go off. Can't you see, Peter, 
they're already making this a 
better world. Cancer and polio 
gone — two things that Man had 
fought for years and was far 
from conquering. War stopped, 
disease stopped, atomic bombs 
stopped — things we couldn't solve 
for ourselves that were solved for 
us." 

"I know all that," said Peter. 
"They'll undoubtedly also put an 
end to crime and graft and violence and everything else that has 
been tormenting and degrading 
mankind since it climbed down 
out of the trees."

"What more do you want?" 

"Nothing more, I guess — it's 
just that it's circumstantial. 
It's not real evidence. All that we 
know, or think we know, we've 
learned from inference. We have 
no proof — no actual, solid proof." 

"We have faith. We must have 
faith. If you can't believe in 
someone or something that wipes 
out disease and war, what can 
you believe in?" 

"That's what bothers me." 

"The world is built on faith," 
said Mary. "Faith in God and in 
ourselves and in the decency of 
mankind." 

"You're wonderful," exclaimed 
Peter. 

He caught her tight and kissed 
her and she clung against him 
and when finally they let each 
other go, the great bronze door 
was opening. 

SILENTLY, they walked across 
the threshold with arms 
around each other, into a foyer 
that arched high overhead. There 
were murals on the high arched 
ceiling, and others paneled in 
the walls, and four great flights 
of stairs led upward. 

But the stairways were roped 
off by heavy velvet cords. Another cord, hooked into gleaming 
standards, and signs with pointing arrows showed them which 
way to go. 

Obediently, walking in the hush 



that came close to reverence, they 
went across the foyer to the single open door. 

They stepped into a large 
room, with great, tall, slender 
windows that let in the morning 
sunlight, and it fell across the 
satiny newness of the blackboards, the big-armed class 
chairs, the heavy reading tables, 
case after case of books, and the 
lectern on the lecture platform. 

They stood and looked at it 
and Mary said to Peter: "I was 
right. They were school bells, 
after all. We've come to school, 
Peter. The first day we ever went 
to school." 

"Kindergarten," Peter said, and 
his voice choked as he pronounced the word. 

It was just right, he thought, 
so humanly right: The sunlight 
and the shadow, the rich bindings of the books, the dark patina 
of the wood, the heavy silence 
over everything. It was an 
Earthly classroom in the most 
scholarly tradition. It was Cambridge and Oxford and the Sorbonne and an Eastern ivy college 
all rolled into one. 

The aliens hadn't missed a bet 
— not a single bet. 

"I have to go ," sai d Mary . 
"You wait right here for me." 

"I'll wait right here," he promised. 

He watched her cross the room 
and open a door. Through it, he 



48 




 



saw a corridor that went on for 
what seemed miles and miles. 
Then she shut the door and he 
was alone. 

He stood there for a moment, 
then swung swiftly around. Almost running across the foyer, 
he reached the great bronze door. 
But there was no door, or none 
that he could see. There was not 
even a crack where a door should 
be. He went over the wall inch 
by inch and he found no door. 

He turned away from the wall 
and stood in the foyer, naked of 
soul, and felt the vast emptiness 
of the building thunder in his 
brain. 

Up there, he thought, up there 
for a thousand stories, the building stretched into the sky. And 
down here was kindergarten and 
up on the second floor, no doubt, 
first grade, and you'd go up and 
up and what would be the end 
— and the purpose of that end? 

When did you graduate? 

Or did you ever graduate? 

And when you graduated, what 
would you be? 

What would you be? he asked. 

Would you be human still? 

HpHEY would be coming to 
school for days, the ones who 
had been picked, the ones who 
had passed the strange entrance 
examination that was necessary 
to attend this school. They'd 
come down the metal roads and 



climb the steps and the great 
bronze door would open and they 
would enter. And others would 
come, too, out of curiosity, but if 
they did not have the symbol, 
the doors would not open for 
them. 

And those who did come in, 
when and if they felt the urge to 
flee, would find there were no 
doors. 

He went back into the classroom and stood where he had 
stood before. 

Those books, he wondered. 
What was in them? In just a little 
while, he'd have the courage to 
pick one out and see. And the 
lectern? What would stand behind the lectern? 

What, not who. 

The door opened and Mary 
came across the room to him. 

"There are apartments out 
there," she said. "The cutest 
apartments you have ever seen. 
And one of them has our names 
on it and there are others that 
have other names and some that 
have no names at all. There are 
other people coming, Peter. We 
were just a little early. We were 
the ones who started first. We 
got here before the school bell 
rang." 

Peter nodded. "Let's sit down 
and wait," he said. 

Side by side, they sat down, 
waiting for the Teacher.
