OLD LAWS- NEW USES 



"IVTOT long ago, I stated in an 
editorial that every social 
action produces an equal and opposite reaction. That, of course, 
was Newton's third law of motion 
applied to sociology, and it was 
offered as a useful tool for probing the future. 

A tool, please note, not a key — 
if there is one, I haven't encountered it. 

As a formula, the application of 
Newton's law is far less sterile 
and much more realistic than the 
linear theory of history, which 
claims that the future will be very 
much like the present, only more 
so. One example of linear thinking is the belief that the recent 
trend toward less and lighter 
clothing will result in universal 
nudism. Actually, a trend in the 
opposite direction is visibly gathering momentum. I have no idea 
where it will end, but perhaps you 
remember my pointing out that 
the exhibitionism of the early 19th 
Century resulted in Victorianism. 

There's another old law on the 
books, this time in economics — 
Gresham's law : "Bad money 
drives out good money" — that I 
have found richly helpful in extrapolation. 

Here are some extensions of 
Gresham's law: 



• Bad politics drives out the 
good. This has at least two barrels—both good politics and good 
people are driven out. Such political truncations as underground 
movements and exile governments are evidence of the first. 
The hundreds of thousands of 
refugees from Nazism and now 
Communism tragically prove the 
second; less drastic examples are 
those citizens who move away 
from corrupt communities. 

• Bad culture drives out good. 
Never in history has hackwork 
supported so many artists, writers, composers, actors and dancers so bountifully. Would they 
have become great if they hadn't 
commercialized their ability? 
Certainly not all, but there's no 
doubt that some major talents 
were lost. 

• Bad science drives out good. 
When Lysenkoism became the 
official theory, Soviet biology 
withered to mere dogma. Their 
psychiatry, shunning Freud, has 
long been mechanistic, and Lord 
knows what will happen to medicine there, now that it's been put 
under racist attack. 

• Slang drives out good language. 

This extension of Gresham's 
law really interests me, for the 



2 




 



future of language is a big, challenging puzzle to every science 
fiction author. 

The Story of English by Mario 
Pei, published by Lippincott, is 
the most stimulating book I've 
found on the subject. It has special value for writers, but readers 
will find it no less fascinating, for 
it dramatically examines the past 
and present and shrewdly speculates on the future of the language. 

Considering the travail of English recorded by Mr. Pei, it seems 
foolhardy to guess at the tongue 
or tongues our far descendants 
will speak. In less than a millenium, English has changed so vastly that a modern German or 
Scandinavian, sent back in time 
to the days of Chaucer, would 
understand more than a monolingual Britisher or American. 

As noted before, slang drives 
out good language. But, says Mr. 
Pei, slang also drives out slang — 
who today uses "23 skiddoo," 
"cat's whiskers," "lounge lizard," 
"flapper," and other relics of only 
a few decades ago? In the same 
way, current jargon is mostly 
bound to be evicted by newer and 
perhaps as ephemeral terms. 
Mostly, not all, for "One insidious quality of slang," writes the 
author, "is its tendency to seep 
into the standard language until 
it becomes the standard language 
itself." 



As examples, he offers methinks, encroach, purport, until, 
devoid, nowadays, furthermore 
and wherewithal, which once 
were attacked as slang. 

Near Plymouth in England is 
Torpenhow Hill: tor, Saxon; pen, 
Celtic; how, Scandinavian haugr; 
hill, Middle English-^-translating 
to Hillhillhill Hill! 

After being invaded from, every 
side, English is now invading 
other languages. Tegedizt is the 
Italian version of "Take it easy ;" 
Japan has adopted O Kei, kokakora and its competitor, pepusikora, and the very insulting 
basadti and sutinka; the Chinese 
call "humor" yuh meh, play p'u 
k'e with chips, and use the re lu 
feng to call up their friends. 

i^iRESHAM'S law is only half 
^-^ right; it doesn't help a bit in 
foretelling the point at which the 
good eventually turns and drives 
out the bad. That inevitably happens, as history verifies. It applies to money and language, at 
any rate, and we can see improvement in TV, movies and publishing as a result of public surfeit 
with junk and nonsense. Every 
tyranny commits a final outrage 
that brings about its ruin. 

What is the other half of 
Gresham's law? Why, old Sir 
Isaac's third law of motion, of 
course.

KINDERGARTEN 

Why should anyone fear an object meant only 





HE went walking in the 
morning before the Sun 
was up, down past the 
old, dilapidated barn that was 
falling in upon itself, across the 
stream and up the slope of pasture ankle-deep with grass and 
summer flowers, when the world 
was wet with dew and the chill 
edge of night still lingered in the 
air. 

He went walking in the morning because he knew he might not 
have too many mornings left; 
any day, the pain might close 
down for good and he was ready 
for it — he'd been ready for it for 
a long time now. 



He was in no hurry. He took 
each walk as if it were his last 
and he did not want to miss a 
single thing on any of the walks 
— the turned-up faces of the pasture roses with the tears of dew 
running down their cheeks or the 
matins of the birds in the thickets 
that ran along the ditches. 

He found the machine alongside the path that ran through 
a thicket at the head of a ravine. 
At first glance, he was irritated 
by it, for it was not only unfamiliar, but an incongruous thing 
as well, and he had no room in 
heart or mind for anything but 
the commonplace. It had been 
the commonplace, the expected, the basic reality of Earth and 
the life one lived on it which he 
had sought in coming to this 
abandoned farm, seeking out a 
place where he might stand on 
ground of his own choosing to 
meet the final day. 

He stopped in the path and 
stood there, looking at this 
strange machine, feeling the roses 
and the dew and the early morning bird song slip away from him, 
leaving him alone with this thing 
beside the path which looked for 
all the world like some fugitive 
from a home appliance shop. But 
as he looked at it, he began to see 
the little differences and he knew 
that here was nothing he'd, ever 
seen before or heard of — that it 
most certainly was not a wander

ing automatic washer or a delinquent dehumidifier. 

FOR one thing, it shone — not 
with surface metallic luster or 
the gleam of sprayed-on porcelain, but with a shine that was 
all the way through whatever it 
was made of. If you looked at it 
just right, you got the impression 
that you were seeing into it, 
though not clearly enough to be 
able to make out the shape of 
any of its innards. It was rectangular, at a rough guess three 
feet by four by two, and it was 
without knobs for one to turn or 
switches to snap on or dials to 
set — which suggested that it was 
not something one was meant to 
operate. 

He walked over to it and bent 
down and ran his hand along its 
top, without thinking why he 
should reach out and touch it, 
knowing when it was too late 
that probably he should have 
left it alone. But it seemed to be 
all right to touch it, for nothing 
happened — not right away, at 
least. The metal, or whatever it 
was made of, was smooth to the 
hand -and beneath the sleekness 
of its surface he seemed to sense 
a terrible hardness and a frightening strength. 

He took his hand away and 
straightened up, stepped back. 

The machine clicked, just once, 
and he had the distinct impres


sion that it clicked not because 
it had to click to operate, not because it wa s turning itself on , 
but to attract attention, to let 
him know that it was an operating machine and that it had a 
function and was ready to perform it. And he got the impression that for whatever purpose it 
might operate, it would do so 
with high efficiency and a minimum of noise. 

Then it laid an egg. 

Why he thought of it in just 
that way, he never was able to 
explain, even later when he had 
thought about it. 

But, anyhow, it laid an egg, 
and the egg was a piece of jade, 
green with milky whiteness running through it, and exquisitely 
carved with what appeared to be 
outre symbolism. 

He stood there in the path, 
looking at the jade, for a moment 
forgetting in his excitement how 
it had materialized, caught up 
by the beauty of the jade itself 
and the superb workmanship 
that had wrought it into shape. 
It was, he told himself, the finest 
piece that he had ever seen and 
he knew exactly how its texture 
would feel beneath his fingers 
and just how expertly, upon close 
examination, he would find the 
carving had been done. 

He bent and picked it up and 
held it lovingly between his 
hands, comparing it with the 



6 




 



pieces he had known and handled for years in the museum. 
But now, even with the jade between his hands, the museum was 
a misty place, far back along the 
corridors of time, although it had 
been less than three months 
since he had walked away from 
it. 

"Thank you," he said to the 
machine and an instant later 
thought what a silly thing to do, 
talking to a machine as if it were 
a person. 

The machine just sat there. It 
did not click again and it did not 
move. 

So finally he left, walking back 
to the old farmhouse on the slope 
above the barn. 

¥N the kitchen, he placed the 
jade in the center of the table, 
where he could see it while he 
worked. He kindled a fire in the 
stove and fed in split sticks of 
wood, not too large, to make 
quick heat. He put the kettle on 
to warm and got dishes from the 
pantry and set his place. He fried 
bacon and drained it on paper 
toweling and cracked the last of 
the eggs into the skillet. 

He ate, staring at the jade that 
stood in front of him, admiring 
once again its texture, trying to 
puzzle out the symbolism of its 
carving and finally wondering 
what it might be worth. Plenty, 
he thought— although, of all con


siderations, that was the least 
important. 

The carving puzzled him. It 
was in no tradition that he had 
ever seen or of which he had ever 
read. What it was meant to represent, he could not imagine. And 
yet it had a beauty and a force, a 
certain character, that tagged it 
as no haphazard doodling, but as 
the product of a highly developed 
culture. 

He did not hear the young 
woman come up the steps and 
walk across the porch, but first 
knew that she was there when 
she rapped upon the door frame. 
He looked up from the jade and 
saw her standing in the open 
kitchen doorway and at first sight 
of her he found himself, ridicu' lously, thinking of her in the 
same terms he had been thinking 
of the jade. 

The jade was cool and green 
and she was crisp and white, but 
her eyes, he thought, had the soft 
look of this wondrous piece of 
jade about them, except that 
they were blue. 

"Hello, Mr. Chaye," she said. 

"Good morning," he replied. 

She was Mary Mallet, Johnny's 
sister. 

"Johnny wanted to go fishing," 
Mary told him. "He and the little 
Smith boy. So I brought the milk 
and eggs." 

"I am pleased you did," said 
Peter, "although you should not

have bothered. I could have 
walked over later. It would have 
done me good." 

He immediately regretted that 
last sentence, for it was something he was thinking too much 
lately — that such and such an act 
or the refraining from an act 
would do him good when, as a 
matter of plain fact, there was 
nothing that would help him at 
all. The doctors had made at 
least that much clear to him. 

TIE took the eggs and milk and 
asked her in and went to 
place the milk in the cooler, for 
he had no electricity for a refrigerator. 

"Have you had breakfast?" he 
asked. 

Mary said she had. 

"It's just as well," he said wryly. "My cooking's pretty bad. 
I'm just camping out, you know." 

And regretted that one, too. 

Chaye, he told himself, quit 
being so damn maudlin. 

' 'What a pretty thing ! " exclaimed Mary. "Wherever did 
you get it?" 

"The jade? Now, that's a funny thing. I found it." 

She reached, a hand out for it. 

"May I?" 

"Certainly," said Peter. 

He watched her face as she 
picked it up and held it in both 
hands, carefully, as he had held 

it . 



"You found this?" 

"Well, I didn't exactly find it, 
Mary. It was given to me." 

"A friend?" 

"I don't know." 

"That's a funny thing to say." 

"Not so funny. I'd like to 
show you the — well, the character 
who gave it to me. Have you got 
a minute?" 

"Of course X have," said Mary, 
"although I '11 have to hurry . 
Mother's canning peaches." 

They went down the slope 
together, past the barn, and crossed the creek to come into the pasture. As they walked up the 
pasture, he wondered if they 
would find it there, if it still was 
there — or ever had been there. 

It was. 

"What an outlandish thing !" 
said Mary. 

"That's the word exactly," 
Peter agreed. 

"What is it, Mr. Chaye?" 

"I don't know." 

"You said you were given the 
jade. You don't mean . . ." 

"But I do," said Peter. 

They moved closer to the machine and stood watching it. Peter 
noticed once again the shine of it 
and the queer sensation of being 
able to see into it — not very far, 
just part way, and not very well 
at that. But still the metal or 
whatever it was could be seen 
into, and that was somehow uncomfortable.

Mary bent over and ran her 
fingers along its top. 

"It feels all right," she said. 
"Just like porcelain or — " 

The machine clicked and a 
flagon lay upon the grass. 

"For you," said Peter. 

"For me?" 

OETER picked up the tiny bottie and handed it to her. It 
was a triumph of glassblower's 
skill and it shone with sparkling 
prismatic color in the summer 
sunlight. 

"Perfume would be my guess," 
he said. 

She worked the stopper loose. 

"Lovely," she breathed and 
held it out to him to smell. 

It was all of lovely. 

She corked it up again. 

"But, Mr. Chaye . . .*' 

"I don't know," said Peter. "I 
simply do not know." 

"Not even a guess?" 

He shook his head. 

"You just found it here." 

"I was out for a walk — " 

"And it was waiting for you." 

"Well, now . . ." Peter began 
to object, but now that he 
thought about it, that seemed exactly right — he had not found the 
machine: it had been waiting for 
him. 

"It was, wasn't it?" 

"Now that you mention it," 
said Peter, "yes, I guess it was 
waiting for me." 



Not for him specifically, perhaps, but for anyone who might 
come along the path. It had been 
waiting to be found, waiting for 
a chance to go into its act, to do 
whatever it was supposed to do. 

For now it appeared, as plain 
as day, that someone had left it 
there. 

He stood in the pasture with 
Mary Mallet, farmer's daughter, 
standing by his side — with the 
familiar grasses and the undergrowth and trees, with the shrill 
of locust screeching across the 
rising heat of day, with the faroff tinkle of a cowbell — and felt 
the chill of the thought within 
his brain, the cold and terrible 
thought backgrounded by the 
black of space and the dim endlessness of time. And he felt, as 
well, a reaching out of something, 
of a chilly alien thing, toward the 
warmth of humanity and Earth. 

"Let's go back," he said. 

rTiHEY returned across the pasture to the house and stood 
for a moment at the gate. 

"Isn't there something we 
should do?" asked Mary. "Someone we should tell about it?" 

He shook his. head. "I want to 
think about it first." 

"And do something about it?" 

"There may be nothing that 
anyone can or should do." 

He watched her go walking 
down the road, then turned away 



KINDERGARTEN

and went back to the house. 

He got out the lawn mower and 
cut the grass. After the lawn was 
mowed, he puttered in the flowerbed. The zinnias were coming 
along fine, but something had 
gotten into the asters and they 
weren't doing well. And the grass 
kept creeping in, he thought. No 
matter what he did, the grass 
kept creeping into the bed to 
strangle out the plants. 

After lunch, he thought, maybe I'll go fishing. Maybe going 
fishing will do me — 

He caught the thought before 
he finished it. 

He squatted by the flowerbed, 
dabbing at the ground with the 
point of his gardening trowel, 
and thought about the machine 
out in the pasture. 

I want to think about it, he'd 
told Mary, but what was there to 
think about? 

Something that someone had 
left in his pasture — a machine 
that clicked and laid a gift like 
an egg when you patted it. 

What did that mean? 

Why was it here? 

Why did it click and hand out 
a gift when you patted it? 

Response? The way a dog 
would wag its tail? 

Gratitude? For being noticed 
by a human? 

Negotiation? 

Friendly gesture? 

Booby trap? 



And how had it known he 
would have sold his soul for a 
piece of jade one-half as fine as 
the piece it had given him? 

How had it known a girl would 
like perfume? 

He heard the running footsteps behind him and swung 
around and there was Mary, running across the lawn. 

SHE reached him and went 
down on her knees beside him 
and her hands clutched his arm. 

"Johnny found it, too," she 
panted. "I ran all the way. Johnny and that Smith boy found it. 
They cut across the pasture corning home from fishing . . ." 

"Maybe we should have reported it," said Peter. 

"It gave them something, too. 
A rod and reel to Johnny and a 
baseball bat and mitt to. little 
Augie Smith." 

"Oh. good Lord!" 
"And now they're telling everyone." 

"It doesn't matter," Peter said. 
"At least, I don't suppose it matters." 

"What is that thing out there? 
You said you didn't know. But 
you have some idea. Peter, you 
must have some idea." 

"I think it's alien," Peter reluctantly and embarrassedly 
told her. "It has a funny look 
about it, like nothing I've ever 
seen or read about, and Earth ma

chines don't give away things 
when you lay a hand on them. 
You have to feed them coins first. 
This isn't — isn't from Earth." 

"From Mars, you mean?" 

"Not from Mars," said Peter. 
"Not from this solar system. We 
have no reason to think another 
race of high intelligence exists in 
this solar system and whoever 
dreamed up that machine had 
plenty of intelligence." 

"But . . . not from this solar 
system ..." 

"From some other star." 

"The stars are so far away!" 
she protested. 

So far away, thought Peter. So 
far out of the reach of the human 
race. Within the reach of dreams, 
but not the reach of hands. So far 
away and so callous and uncaring. And the machine — 

"Like a slot machine," he said, 
"except it always pays in jackpots and you don't even need a 
coin. That is crazy, Mary. That's 
one reason it isn't of this Earth. 
No Earth machine, no Earth inventor, would do that." 

"The neighbors will be coming," Mary said. 

"I know they will. They'll be 
coming for their handouts." 

"But it isn't very big. It could 
not carry enough inside it for 
the entire neighborhood. It does 
not have much more than room 
enough for the gifts it's already 
handed out." 



"Mary, did Johnny want a rod 
and reel?" 

"He'd talked of practically 
nothing else." 

"And you like perfume?" 

"I'd never had any good perfume. Just cheap stuff." She 
laughed a little nervously. "And 
you? Do you like jade?" 

"I'm what you might call a 
minor expert on it. It's a passion 
with me." 

"Then that machine . . 

"Gives each one the thing he 
wants," Peter finished for her. 

"It's frightening," said Mary. 

And it seemed strange that 
anything at all could be frightening on such a day as this — a 
burnished summer day, with 
white clouds rimming the western 
horizon and the sky the color of 
pale blue silk, a day that had no 
moods, but was as commonplace 
as the cornfield earth. 

A FTER Mary had left, Peter 
went in the house and made 
his lunch. He sat by the window, 
eating it, and watched the neighbors come. They came by twos 
and threes, tramping across the 
pasture from all directions, coming to his pasture from their own 
farms, leaving the haying rigs 
and the cultivators, abandoning 
their work in the middle of the 
day to see the strange machine. 
They stood around and talked, 
tramping down the thicket where

11 



he had found the machine, and 
at times their high, shrill voices 
drifted across to him, but he 
could not make out what they 
said, for the words were flattened 
and distorted by the distance. 

From the stars, he'd said. From 
some place among the stars. 

And if that be fantasy, he said, 
I have a right to it. 

First contact, he thought. 

And clever! 

Let an alien being arrive on 
Earth and the women would run 
screaming for their homes and the 
men would grab their rifles and 
there'd be hell to pay. 

But a machine — that was a 
different matter. What if it was 
a little different? What if it acted 
a little strangely? After all, it 
was only a machine. It was something that could be understood. 

And if it handed out free gifts, 
that was all the better. 

After lunch, he went out and 
sat on the steps and some of the 
neighbors came and showed him 
what the machine had given 
them. They sat around and talked, all of them excited and mystified, but not a single one of them 
was scared. 

Among the gifts were wrist watches and floor lamps, typewriters and fruit juicers, sets of 
dishes, chests of silver, bolts of 
drapery materials, shoes, shotguns, carving sets, book ends, 
neckties, and many other items. 



One youngster had a dozen 
skunk traps and another had a 
bicycle. 

A modern Pandora's box, 
thought Peter, made by an alien 
intelligence and set down upon 
the Earth. 

Apparently the word was 
spreading, for now the people 
came in cars. Some of them parked by the road and walked down 
to the pasture and others came 
into the barnyard and parked 
there, not bothering to ask for 
permission. 

After a time, they would come 
back loaded with their loot and 
drive away. Out in the pasture 
was a milling throng of people. 
Peter, watching it, was reminded 
of a county fair or a village carnival. 

BY chore-time, the last of them 
had gone, even the neighbors 
who had come to say a few words 
with him and to show him what 
they'd gotten, so he left the house 
and walked up the pasture slope. 

The machine still was there 
and it was starting to build something. It had laid out around it 
a sort of platform of a stone that 
looked like marble, as if it were 
laying a foundation for a building. The foundation was about 
ten feet by twelve' and was set 
level against the pasture's slope, 
with footings of the same sort of 
stone going down into the ground.

He sat down on a stump a little 
distance away and looked out 
over the peace of the countryside. 
It seemed more beautiful, more 
quiet and peaceful than it had 
ever seemed before, and he sat 
there contentedly, letting the 
evening soak into his soul. 

rriHE Sun had set not more than 
half an hour ago. The western sky was a delicate lemon 
fading into green, with here and 
there the pink of wandering 
cloud, while beneath the horizon 
the land lay in the haze of a blue 
twilight, deepening at the edges. 
The liquid evensong of birds ran 
along the hedges and the thickets 
and the whisper of swallows' 
wings came down from overhead. 

This is Earth, he thought, the 
peaceful, human Earth, a landscape shaped by an agricultural 
people. This is the Earth of plum 
blossom and of proud red barns 
and of corn rows as straight as 
rifle barrels. 

For millions of years, the Earth 
had lain thus, without interference; a land of soil and life, a 
local corner of the Galaxy engaged in its own small strivings. 

And now? 

Now, finally, there was interference. 

Now, finally, someone or something had come into this local 
corner of the Galaxy and Earth 
was alone no longer. 



To himself, he knew, it did not 
matter. Physically, there was no 
longer anything that possibly 
could matter to him. All that was 
left was the morning brightness 
and the evening peace and from 
each of these, from every hour of 
each day that was left to him, it 
was his purpose to extract the 
last bit of joy in being alive. 

But to the others it would matter — to Mary Mallet and her 
brother Johnny, to the little 
Smith boy who had gotten the 
baseball bat and mitt, to all the 
people who had visited this pasture, and to all the millions who 
had not visited or even heard 
of it. 

Here, in this lonely place in 
the midst of the great cornlands, 
had come, undramatically, a 
greater drama than the Earth 
had yet known. Here was the 
pivot point. 

He said to the machine : "What 
do you intend with us?" 

There was no answer. 

He had not expected one. 

He sat and watched the shadows deepen and the lights spring 
up in the farm houses that were 
sprinkled on the land. Dogs barked from far away and others answered them and the cowbells 
rang across the hills like tiny 
vesper notes. 

At last, when he could see no 
longer, he walked slowly back to 
the house.

TN the kitchen, he found a lamp 
*- and lit it. He saw by the 

kitchen clock that it was almost 
nine o'clock — time for the evening news. 

He went into the living room 
and turned on the radio. Sitting 
in the dark, he listened to it. 

There was good news. 

There had been no polio deaths 
in the state that day and only 
one new case had been reported. 

"It is too soon to hope, of 
course," the newscaster said, "but 
it definitely is the first break in 



the epidemic. Up to the time of 
broadcast, there have been no 
new cases for more than twenty 
hours. The state health director 
said . . ." 

He went on to read what the 
health director said, which wasn't 
much of anything, just one of 
those public statements which 
pretty generally add up to nothing tangible. 

It was the first day in almost 
three weeks, the newscaster had 
said, during which no polio 
deaths had been reported. But 




Emmett murder trial had been 
postponed another month. 

Then he said: "Someone has 
just handed me a bulletin. Now 
let me see . . ." 

You could hear the paper rustling as he held it to read it 
through, could hear him gasp a 
little. 

"It says here," he said, "that 
Sheriff Joe Burns has just now 
been notified that a Flying Saucer 
has landed on the Peter Chaye 
farm out near Mallet Corners. 
No one seems to know too much 
about it. One report is that it was 
found this morning, but no one 
thought to notify the sheriff. Let 
me repeat — this is just a report. 
We don't know any more than 
what we've told you. We don't 
know if it is true or not. The 
sheriff is on his way there now. 
We'll let you know as soon as 
we learn anything. Keep tuned 
to this . . ." 

Peter got up and turned off the 
radio. Then he went into the 
kitchen to bring in the lamp. He 
set the lamp on a table and sat 
down again to wait for Sheriff 
Burns. 

He didn't have long to wait. 

"p^OLKS tell me," said the sheriff, "this here Flying Saucer 
landed on your farm." 

"I don't know if it's a Flying 
Saucer, Sheriff." 

"Well, what is it, then?" 



"I wouldn't know," said Peter. 

"Folks tell me it was giving 
away things." 

"It was doing that, all right." 

"If this is some cockeyed advertising stunt," the sheriff said, 
"I'll have someone's neck for it." 

"I'm sure it's not an advertising stunt." 

"Why didn't you notify me 
right off? What you mean by 
holding out on a thing like this?" 

"I didn't think of notifying 
you," Peter told him. "I wasn't 
trying to hold out on anything." 

"You new around here, ain't 
you?" asked the sheriff. "I don't 
recollect seeing you before. 
Thought I knew everyone." 

"I've been here three months." 

"Folks tell me you ain't farming the place. Tell me you ain't 
got no family. Live here all by 
yourself, just doing nothing." 

"That's correct," said Peter. 

The sheriff waited for the explanation, but Peter offered none. 
The sheriff looked at him suspiciously in the smOky lamplight. 

"Can you show us this here 
Flying Saucer?" 

By now Peter was a little weary 
of the sheriff, so he said, "I can 
tell you how to find it. You go 
down past the barn and cross the 
brook . . ." 

"Why don't you come with us, 
Chaye?" 

"Look, Sheriff, I was telling 
you how to find it. Do you want 



16 




 



me to continue?" 

"Why, sure," the sheriff said. 
"Of course I do. But why can't 
you . . ,** 

"I've seen it twice," said Peter. 
"I've been overrun by people all 
the afternoon." 

"All right, all right," the sheriff said. "Tell me how to find it." 

He told him and the sheriff 
left, followed by his two deputies. 

The telephone rang. 

Peter answered it. It was the 
radio station he'd been listening 
to. 

"Say," asked the radio reporter, "you got a Saucer out there?" 

"I don't think so," Peter said. 
"I do have something out here, 
though. The sheriff is going out 
to take a look at it." 

"We want to send out our mobile TV unit, but we wanted to 
be sure there was something 
there. It be all right with you if 
we send it out?" 

"No objections. Send it along." 

"You sure you got something 
there?" 

"I told you that I had." 

"Well, then, suppose you tell 
me . . ." 

Fifteen minutes later, he hung 
up. 

The phone rang again. 

TT was the Associated Press. 

The man at the other end of 
the wire was wary and skeptical. 
"What's this I hear about a 



Saucer out there?" 

Ten minutes later, Peter hung 
up. 

The phone rang almost immediately. 

"McClelland of the Tribune," 
said a bored voice. "I heard a 
screwball story . . ." 

Five minutes. 

The phone rang again. 

It was the United Press. 

"Hear you got a Saucer. Any 
little men in it?" 

Fifteen minutes. 

The phone rang. 

It was an irate citizen. 

"I just heard on the radio you 
got a Flying Saucer. What kind 
of gag you trying to pull? You 
know there ain't any Flying 
Saucers . . ." 

"Just a moment, sir," said 
Peter. 

He let the receiver hang by its 
cord and went out to the kitchen. 
He found a pair of clips and 
came back. He could hear the 
irate citizen still chewing him 
out, the voice coming ghostlike 
out of the dangling receiver. 

He went outside and found the 
wire and clipped it. When he 
came back in again, the receiver 
was silent. He hung it carefully 
on the hook. 

Then he locked the doors and 
went to bed. 

To bed, but not immediately to 
sleep. He lay beneath the covers, 
staring up into the darkness and

trying to quiet the turmoil of 
speculation that surged within his 
brain. 

He had gone walking in the 
morning and found a machine. 
He had put his hand upon it 
and it had given him a gift. 
Later on, it had given other gifts. 

"A machine came, bearing 
gifts," he said into the darkness. 

A clever, calculated, wellworked-out first contact. 

Contact them with something 
they will know and recognize and 
need not be afraid of, something 
to which they can feel superior. 

Make it friendly— and what is 
more friendly than handing out 
a gift? 

What is it? 

Missionary? 

Trader? 

Diplomat? 

Or just a mere machine and 
nothing more? 

Spy? Adventurer? Investigator? Surveyor? 

Doctor? Lawyer? Indian chief? 
■ And why, of all places, had it 
landed here, in this forsaken 
farmland, in this pasture on his 
farm? 

And its purpose? 

WHAT had been the purpose, 
the almost inevitable motive, of those fictional alien beings who, in tales of fantasy, had 
landed on Earth? 

To take over, of course. If 



not by force, then by infiltration 
or by friendly persuasion and 
compulsion; to take over not 
only Earth, but the human race 
as well. 

The man from the radio station had been excited, the Associated Press man had been 
indignant that anyone should so 
insult his intelligence, the Tribune 
man had been bored and the 
United Press man flippant. But 
the citizen had been angry. He 
was being taken in by another 
Flying Saucer story and it was 
just too much. 

The citizen was angry because 
he didn't want his little world 
disturbed. He wanted no interference. He had trouble enough 
of his own without things being 
messed up by a Saucer's landing. 
He had problems of his own — 
earning a living, getting along 
with his neighbors, planning his 
work, worrying about the polio 
epidemic. 

Although the newscaster had 
said the polio situation seemed a 
little brighter — no new cases and 
no deaths. And that was a fine 
thing, for polio was pain and 
death and a terror on the land. 

Pain, he thought. 

I've had no pain today. 

For the first time in many 
days, there has been no pain. 

He lay stiff and still beneath 
the covers, examining himself 
for pain. He knew just where it 



18 




 



lurked, the exact spot in his 
anatomy where it lurked hidden 
out of sight. He lay and waited 
for it, fearful, now that he had 
thought of it, that he would find 
it there. • 

But it was not there. 

He lay and waited for it, afraid 
that the very thought of it would 
conjure it up from its hiding 
place. It did not come. He dared 
it to come, he invited it to show 
itself, he hurled mental jibes at 
it to lure it out. It refused to be 
lured. 

He relaxed and knew that for 
the moment he was safe. But 
safe only temporarily, for the 
pain still was there. It bided its 
time , wa ited for its moment, 
would come when the time was 
right. 

With careless abandon, trying 
to wipe out the future and its 
threat, he luxuriated in life without the pain. He listened to the 
house — the slightly settling joists 
that made the floor boards creak, 
the thrum of the light summer 
wind against the weathered siding, the scraping of the elm 
branch against the kitchen roof. 

Another sound. A knocking at 
the door. "Chaye! Chaye, where 
are you?" 

"Coming," he called. 

TTE found slippers and went 
to the door. It was the sheriff 
and his men. 



"Light the lamp," the sheriff 
said. 

"You got a match?" Peter 
asked. 

"Yeah, here are some." 

Groping in the dark, Peter 
found the sheriff's hand and the 
book of matches. 

He located the table, slid his 
hand across the top and felt the 
lamp. He lit it and looked at 
the sheriff from across the table. 

"Chaye," the sheriff said, "that 
thing is building something." 

"I know it is." 

"What's the gag?" 

"There's no gag." 

"It gave me this," the sheriff 
said. 

He threw the object on the 
table. 

"A gun," said Peter. 

"You ever see one like it?" 

It was a gun, all right, about 
the size of a .45. But it had no 
trigger and the muzzle flared and 
the whole thing was made of 
some white, translucent substance. 

Peter picked it up and found it 
weighed no more than half a 
pound or so. 

"No,'* said Peter. "No, I've 
never seen one like it." He put 
it back on the table, gingerly. 
"Does it work?" 

"It does," the sheriff said. "I 
tried it on your barn." 

"There ain't no barn no more," 
said one of the deputies.

"No report, no flash, no nothing," the sheriff added. 

"Just no barn," repeated the 
deputy, obsessed with the idea. 

A car drove into the yard. 

"Go out and see who's there," 
said the sheriff. 

One of the deputies went out. 

"I don't get it," complained the 
sheriff. "They said Flying Saucer, 
but I don't think it's any Saucer. 
A box is all it is." 

"It's a machine," said Peter. 

Feet stamped across the porch 
and men came through the door. 

"Newspapermen," said the deputy who had gone out to see. 

"I ain't got no statement, 
boys," the sheriff said. 

One of them said to Peter : 
"You Chaye?" 

Peter nodded. 

"I'm Hoskins from the Tribune. This is Johnson from the 
AP. That guy over there with the 
sappy look is a photographer, 
name of Langly. Disregard him." 

He pounded Peter on the back. 
"How does it feel to be sitting in 
the middle of the century's biggest news break? Great stuff, 
hey, boy?" 

Langly said: "Hold it." 

A flash bulb popped. 

"I got to use the phone," said 
Johnson. "Where is it?" 

"Over there," said Peter. "It's 
not working," 

"How come at a time like 
this?" 



"I cut the wire." 

"Cut the wire ! You crazy , 
Chaye?" 

"There were too many people 
calling." 

"Now," said -Hoskins, "wasn't 
that a hell of a thing to do?" 

"I'll fix her up," Langly offered. 
"Anyone got a pair of pliers?" 




iHE^ sheriff said, "You boys 
hold on a minute." 



"Hurry up and get into a pair 
of pants," Hoskins said to Peter. 
"We'll want your picture on the 
scene. Standing with your foot 
on it, like the guy that's just 
killed an elephant." 

"You listen here," the sheriff 
said. . 

"What is it, Sheriff?" 

"This here's important. Get it 
straight. You guys can't go messing around with it." 

"Sure it's important," said Hoskins. "That is why we're here. 
Millions of people standing 
around with their tongues hanging out for news." 

"Here are some pliers," someone remarked. 

"Leave me at that phone," said 
Langly. 

"What are we horsing around 
for?" asked Hoskins. "Let's go 
out and see it." 

"I gotta make a call," said 
Johnson. 

"Look here, boys," the sheriff 
insisted in confusion. "Wait — "

"What's it like, Sheriff? Figure 
it's a Saucer? How big is it? 
Does it make a clicking noise 
or something? Hey, Langly, take 
the sheriff's picture." 

"Just a minute," Langly shouted from outside. "I'm fixing up 
this wire." 

More feet came across the 
porch. A head was thrust into the 
door. 

"TV truck," the head said. 
"This the place? How do we get 
out to the thing?" 

The phone rang. 

Johnson answered it. 

"It's for you, Sheriff." 

The sheriff lumbered across the 
room. They waited, listening. 

"Sure, this is Sheriff Burns . . . 
Yeah, it's out there, all right . . . 
Sure, I know. I've seen it . . . No, 
of course, I don't know what it 
is . . . Yes, I understand . . . Yes, 
sir. . . . Yes, sir. I'll see to it, sir." 

He hung up the receiver and 
turned around to face them. 

"That was military intelligence," he said. "No one is going 
out there. No one's moving from 
this house. This place is restricted 
as of this minute." 

He looked from one to another 
of them ferociously. 

"Them's orders," he told them. 

"Oh, hell," said Hoskins. 

"I came all the way out here," 
bawled the TV man. "I'm not 
going to come out here and 
not . . 



"It isn't me that's doing the 
ordering," said the sheriff. "It's 
Uncle Sam. You boys take things 
easy." 

Peter went out into the kitchen 
and poked up the fire and set on 
the kettle. 

"The coffee's there," he said to 
Langly. "I'll put on some clothes." 

CLOWLY, the night wore on. 
^ Hoskins and Johnson phoned 
in the information they had 
jotted down on folded copy paper, their pencils stabbing cryptic 
signs as they talked to Peter and 
the sheriff. After some argument 
with the sheriff about letting him 
go, Langly left with his pictures. 
The sheriff paced up and down 
the room. 

The radio blared. The phone 
banged constantly. 

They drank coffee and smoked 
cigarettes, littering the floor with 
ground-out stubs. More newsmen 
pulled in, were duly warned by 
the sheriff, and settled down to 
wait. 

Someone brought out a bottle 
and passed it around. Someone 
else tried to start a poker game, 
but nobody was interested. 

Peter went out to get an armload of wood. The night was 
quiet, with stars. 

He glanced toward the pasture, 
but there was nothing there to see. 
He tried to make out the empty 
place where the barn had dis

appeared. It was too dark to tell 
whether the barn was there or 
not. 

Death watch or the last dark 
hour before the dawn — the brightest, most wonderful dawn that 
Man had ever seen in all his 
years of striving? 

The machine was building 
something out there, building 
something in the night. 

And what was it building? 

Shrine? 

Trading post? 

Mission house? 

Embassy? 

Fort? 

There was no way of knowing, 
no way that one could tell. 

Whatever it was building, it 
was the first known outpost ever 
built by an alien race on the 
planet Earth. 

He went back into the house 
with the load of wood. 

"They're sending troops," the 
sheriff told him. 

"Tramp, tramp, tramp," said 
Hoskins, dead - pan, cigarette 
hanging negligently to his under
up. 

"The radio just said so,*' the 
sheriff said. "They called out the 
guard." 

Hoskins and Johnson did some 
more tramp-tramping. 

"You guys better not horse 
around with them soldier boys," 
the sheriff warned. "They'll shove 
a bayonet . . ." 



Hoskins made a noise like a 
bugle blowing the charge. Johnson grabbed two spoons and beat 
out galloping hoofs. 

"The calvary!" shouted Hoskins. "By God, boys, we're 
saved!" 

Someone said wearily: "Can't 
you guys be your age?" 

They sat around, as the night 
wore on, drinking coffee and 
smoking. They didn't do much 
talking. 

The radio station finally signed 
off. Someone fooled around, trying to get another station, but 
the batteries were too weak to 
pull in anything. He shut the 
radio off. It had been some time 
now since the phone had rung. 

DAWN was still an hour away 
when the guardsmen arrived, 
not marching, nor riding horses, 
but in five canvas-covered trucks. 

The captain came in for just a 
moment to find out where this 
goddam obscenity Saucer was. 
He was the fidgety type. He 
wouldn't even stay for a cup 
of coffee. He went out yelling 
orders at the drivers. 

Inside the house, the others 
waited and heard the five trucks 
growl away. 

Dawn came and a building 
stood in the pasture, and it was 
a bit confusing, for you could see 
that it was being built in a way 
that was highly unorthodox. 



22 




 



Whoever or whatever was building it had started on the inside 
and was building outward, so that 
you saw the core of the building, 
as if it were a building that was 
being torn down and some one 
already had ripped off the entire 
exterior. 

It covered half an acre and 
was five stories high. It gleamed 
pink in the first light of the 
morning, a beautiful misty pink 
that made you choke up a little, 
remembering the color of the dress 
the little girl next door had worn 
for her seventh birthday party. 

The guardsmen were ringed 
around it, the morning light spattering off their bayonets as they 
stood the guard. 

Peter made breakfast — huge 
stacks of flapjacks, all the bacon 
he had left, every egg he could 
find, a gallon or two of oatmeal, 
more coffee. 

"We'll send out and get some 
grub," said Hoskins. "We'll make 
this right with you." 

After breakfast, the sheriff and 
the deputies drove back to the 
county seat. Hoskins took up a 
collection and went to town to 
buy groceries. The other newsmen stayed on. The TV truck 
got squared off for some wideangle distance shots. 

The telephone started jangling 
again. The newsmen took turns 
answering it. 

Peter walked down the road 



to the Mallet farm to get eggs 
and milk. 

Mary ran out to the gate to 
meet him. "The neighbors are 
getting scared," she said. 

"They weren't scared yesterday," said Peter. "They walked 
right up and got their gifts." 

" 'But this is diff erent, Peter. 
This is getting out of hand. The 
building . . ." 

And that was it, of course. 
The building. 

No one had been frightened of 
an innocent-appearing machine 
because it was small and friendly. 
It shone so prettily and it clicked 
so nicely and it handed out gifts. 
It was something that could be 
superficially recognized and it 
had a purpose that was understandable if one didn't look too 
far. 

But the building was big and 
might get bigger still and it was 
being erected inside out. And who 
in all the world had ever seen a 
structure built as fast as that one 
— five stories in one single night? 

"TJOW do they do it, Peter?" 

Mary asked in a hushed 
little voice. 

"I don't know," he said. "Some 
principle that is entirely alien to 
us, some process that men have 
never even thought of, a way of 
doing things, perhaps, that starts 
on an entirely different premise 
than the human way."

"But it's just the kind of building that men themselves would 
build," she objected. "Not that 
kind of stone, perhaps — maybe 
there isn't any stone like that in 
the entire world — but in every 
other way there's nothing strange 
about it. It looks like a big high 
school or a department store." 

"My jade was jade," said Peter, 
"and your perfume was perfume 
and the rod and reel that Johnny 
got was a regular rod and reel." 

"That means they know about 
us. They know all there is to 
know. Peter, they've been watching us!" 

"I have no doubt of it." 

He saw the terror in her eyes 
and reached out a hand to draw 
her close and she came into his 
arms and he held her tightly and 
thought, even as he did so, how 
strange that he should be the 
one to extend comfort and assurance. 

"I'm foolish, Peter." 
"You're wonderful," he assured 
her. 

"I'm not really scared." 

"Of course you're not." He 
■wanted to say, "I love you," but 
he knew that those were words he 
could never say. Although the 
pain, he thought — the pain had 
not come this morning. 

"I'll get the milk and eggs," 
said Mary. 

"Give me all you can spare. 
I have quite a crowd to feed."

Walking back, he thought 
about the neighbors being frightened now and wondered how long 
it would be before the world got 
frightened, too — how long before 
artillery would be wheeling into 
line, how long before an atom 
bomb would fall. 

He stopped on the rise of the 
hill above the house and for the 
first time noticed that the barn 
was gone.. It had been sheared off 
as cleanly as if cut with a knife, 
with the stump of the foundation 
sliced away at an angle. 

He wondered if the sheriff still 
had the gun and supposed he had. 
And he wondered what the sheriff 
would do with it and why it had 
been given him. For, of all the 
gifts that he had seen, it was the 
only one that was not familiar to 
Earth. 

In the pasture that had been 
empty yesterday, that had been 
only trees and grass and old, 
grassed-over ditches, bordered by 
the wild plum thickets and the 
hazel brush and blackberry vine, 
rose the building. It seemed to 
him that it was bigger than when 
he had seen it less than an hour 
before. 

TJACK at the house, the newspapfermen were sitting in the 
yard, looking at the building. 

One of them said to him, "The 
brass arrived. They're waiting in 
there for you." 


 



"Intelligence?" asked Peter. 

The newsman nodded. "A 
chicken colonel and a major." 

They were waiting in the living 
room. The colonel was a young 
man with gray hair. The major 
wore a mustache, very military. 

The colonel introduced himself. "I'm Colonel Whitman. This 
is Major Rockwell." 

Peter put down his eggs and 
milk and nodded acknowledgment. 

"You found this machine," 
said the colonel. 
"That is right." 

"Tell us about it," said the 
colonel, so Peter told them about 
it. 

"This jade," the colonel said. 
"Could we have a look at it?" 

Peter went to the kitchen and 
got the jade. They passed it from 
one to the other, examining it 
closely, turning it over and over 
in their hands, a bit suspicious 
of it, but admiring it, although 
Peter could see they knew nothing about jade. 

Almost as if he might have 
known what was in Peter's mind, 
the colonel lifted his eyes from 
the jade and looked at him. 

"You know jade," the colonel 
said. 

"Very well," said Peter. 
"You've worked with it before?" 

"In a museum." 

"Tell me about yourself." * 



Peter hesitated — then told 
about himself. 

"But why are you here?" the 
colonel asked. 

"Have you ever been in a 
hospital. Colonel? Have you ever 
thought what it would be like 
to die there?" 

The colonel nodded. "I can see 
your point. But here you'll have 
no — " 

"I won't wait that long." 

"Yes, yes," the colonel said. "I 
see." — 

"Colonel," said, the major. 
"Look at this, sir, if you will. 
This symbolism is the same . . ." 

The colonel snatched it from 
his hands and looked. 

"The same as on the letterhead!" he shouted. 

The colonel lifted his head and 
stared at Peter, as if it had been 
the first time he had seen him, 
as if he were surprised at seeing 
him. 

There was, suddenly, a gun in 
the major's hand, pointing at 
Peter, its mu22le a cold and 
steady eye. 

Peter tried to throw himself 
aside. 

He was too late. 

The major shot him down. 

OETER fell for a million years 
through a wool-gray nothingness that screamed and he 
knew it must be a dream, an 
endless atavistic dream of falling, 



KINDERGARTEN 



25 



brought down through all the 
years from incredibly remote 
forebears who had dwelt in trees 
and had lived in fear of falling. 
He tried to pinch himself to 
awaken from the dream, but he 
couldn't do it, since he had no 
hands to pinch with, and, after a 
time, it became apparent that 
he had no body to pinch. He 
was a disembodied consciousness 
hurtling through a gulf which 
seemed to have no boundaries. 

He fell for a million years 
through the void that seemed to 
scream at him. At first the 
screaming soaked into him and 
filled his soul, since he had no 
body, with a terrible agony that 
went on and on, never quite 
reaching the breaking point that 
would send him into the release 
of insanity. But he got used to 
it after a time and as soon as 
he did, the screaming stopped 
and he plunged down through 
space in a silence that was more 
dreadful than the screaming. 

He fell forever and forever and 
then it seemed that forever ended, 
for he was at rest and no longer 
falling. 

He saw a face. It was a face 
from incredibly long ago, a face 
that he once had seen and had 
long forgotten, and he searched 
back along his memory to try to 
identify it. 

He couldn't see it too clearly, 
for it seemed to keep bobbing 



around so he couldn't pin it down. 
He tried and tried and couldn't 
and he closed his eyes to shut the 
face away. 

"Chaye," a voice said. "Peter 
Chaye." 

"Go away," said Peter. 

The voice went away. 

He opened his eyes again and 
the face was there, clearer now 
and no longer bobbing. 

It was the colonel's face. 

HE shut his eyes again, remembering the steady eye of 
the gun the major had held. He'd 
jumped aside, or tried to, and 
he had been too slow. Something 
had happened and he'd fallen for 
a million years and here he was, 
with the colonel looking at him. 

He'd been shot. That was the 
answer, of course. The major had 
shot him and he was in a hospital. But where had he been 
hit? Arm? Both arms seemed to 
be all right. Leg? Both legs 
were all right, too. No pain. No 
bandages. No casts. 

The colonel said: "He came to 
for just a minute, Doc, and now 
he's off again." 

"He'll be all right," said Doc. 
"Just give him time. You gave 
him too big a charge, that's all. 
It'll take a little time." 
"We must talk to him." 
"You'll have to wait." 
There was silence for a moment. 



26 




 



Then: "You're absolutely sure 
he's human?" 

"We've gone over every inch 
of him," said Doc. "If he isn't 
human, he's too good an imitation for us ever to find out." 

"He told me he had cancer,** 
the colonel said. "Claimed he was 
dying of cancer. Don't you see, 
if he wasn't human, if there was 
something wrong, he could always try to make it look . . ." 

"He hasn't any cancer. Not a 
sign of it. No sign he ever had it. 
No sign he ever will." 

"C^VEN with his eyes shut, Peter 
felt that he was agape with 
disbelief and amazement. He 
forced his eyes to stay closed, 
afraid that this was a trick. 

"That other doctor," the colonel said, "told Peter Chaye four 
months ago he had six more 
months to live. He told him . . ." 

Doc said, "Colonel, I won't 
even try to explain it. All I can 
tell you is that the man lying 
on that bed hasn't got cancer. 
He's as healthy a man as you 
would wish to find." 

"It isn't Peter Chaye, then," 
the colonel stated in a dogged 
voice. "It's something that took 
over. Peter Chaye or duplicated 
Peter Chaye or . . 

Doc said, "Now, now, Colonel. 
Let's stick to what we know." 

"You're sure he's a man, Doc?" 

"I'm sure he's a human being, 



if that is what you mean." 

"No little differences? Just one 
seemingly unimportant deviation 
from the human norm?" 

"None," Doc said, "and even if 
there were, it wouldn't prove what 
you are after. There could be 
minor mutational difference in 
anyone. The human body doesn't 
always run according to a blueprint." 

"There were differences in all 
that stuff the machine gave away. 
Little differences that came to 
light only on close examination — 
but differences that spelled out a 
margin between human and alien 
manufacture.** 

"All right, then, so there were 
differences. So those things were 
made by aliens. I still tell you 
this man is a human being." 

"It all ties in so neatly,'* the 
colonel declared. "Chaye goes out 
and buys this . place — this old, 
abandoned farm. He's eccentric 
as hell by the standards of that 
neighborhood. By the very fact 
of his eccentricity, he invites attention, which might be undesirable, but at the same time his 
eccentricity might be used to 
cover up and smooth over anything he did out of the ordinary. 
It would be just somebody like 
him who'd supposedly find a 
strange machine. It would be . . , M 

"You're building up a case,*' 
said Doc, "without anything to 
go on. You asked for one little 



KINDERGARTEN 



difference in him to base your 
cockeyed theory on — no offense, 
but that's how I, as a doctor, see 
it. Well, now let's have one little 
fact — fact, mind you, not guess — 
to support this idea of yours." 

"What was in that barn?" demanded the colonel. "That's 
what I want to know. Did Chaye 
build that machine in there? Was 
that why it was destroyed?" 

"The sheriff destroyed the 
barn," the doctor said. "Chaye 
had nothing to do with it." 

"But who gave the gun to the 
sheriff? Chaye's machine, that's 
who. And it would be an easy 
matter of suggestion, mind control, hypnotism, whatever you 
want to call it . . ." 

"Let's get back to facts. You 
used an anesthetic gun on this 
man. You've held him prisoner. 
By your orders, he has been subjected to intensive examination, 
a clear invasion of his privacy. 
I hope to God he never brings 
you into court. He could throw 
the book at you." 
v "I know," the colonel admitted 
reluctantly. "But we have to bust 
this thing. We must find out what 
it is. We have got to get that 
bomb back!" 

"The bomb's what worries 
you." 

"Hanging up there," the colonel said, sounding as if he'd 
shuddered. "Just hanging up 
there!" 



"I have to get along," replied 
the doctor. "Take it easy, Colonel." 

rriHE doctor's footsteps went 
out the door and down the 
corridor, fading away. The colonel paced up and down a while 
and then sat down heavily in a 
chair. 

Peter lay in bed, and one 
thought crashed through his 
brain, one thought again and 
again: 

Vm going to live! 

But he hadn't been. 

He had been ready for the day 
when the pain finally became too 
great to bear. 

He had picked his ground to 
spend his final days, to make his 
final stand. 

And now he had been reprieved. Now, somehow, he had 
been given back his life. 

He lay in the bed, fighting 
against excitement, against a 
growing tenseness, trying to 
maintain the pretense that he still 
was under the influence of whatever he'd been shot with. 

An anesthetic gun, the doctor 
had said. Something new, something he had never heard of. 
And yet somewhere there was a 
hint of it. Something, he remembered, about dentistry — a new 
technique that dentists used to 
desensitize the gums, a fine stream 
of anesthetic sprayed against the 



26 




 



gums. Something like that, only 
hundreds or thousands of times 
stronger? 

Shot and brought here and examined because of some wild 
fantasy lurking in the mind of a 
G-2 colonel. 

Fantasy? He wondered. Unwitting, unsuspecting, could he 
have played a part? It was ridiculous, of course. For he remembered nothing he had done or 
said or even thought which gave 
him a clue to any part he might 
have played in the machine*s 
coming to the Earth. 

Could cancer be something 
other than disease? Some uninvited guest, perhaps, that came 
and lived within a human body? 
A clever alien guest who came 
from far away, across the unguessed light-years? 

And that, he knew, was fantasy to match the colonel's 
fantasy, a malignant nightmare 
of distrust that dwelt within the 
human mind, an instinctive defense mechanism that conditioned 
the race to expect the worst and 
to arm against it. 

There was nothing feared so 
much as the unknown factor, 
nothing which one must guard 
against so much as the unexplained. 

We have to bust this thing, the 
colonel had said. We must find 
out what it is. 

And, that, of course, was the 



terror of it— that they had no 
way of knowing what it was. 

HE stirred at last, very deliberately, and the colonel 
spoke. 

"Peter Chaye," he said. 

"Yes, what is it, Colonel?" 

"I have to talk to you." 

"All right, talk to me." 

He sat up in the bed and saw 
that he was in a hospital room. 
It had the stark, antiseptic quality, the tile floor, the colorless 
walls, the utilitarian look — and 
the bed on which he lay was a 
hospital bed. 

"How do you feel?" the colonel 
asked. 

"Not so hot," confessed Peter. 

"We were a little rough on you, 
but we couldn't take a chance. 
There was the letter, you see, and 
the slot machines and the stamp 
machines and all the other things 
and . . ." 

"You said something about a letterhead." 

"What do you know about 
that, Chaye?" 

"I don't know a thing." 

"It ' came to the President," 
said the colonel. "A month or so 
ago. And a similar one went to 
every other administrative head 
on the entire Earth." 
"Saying?" 

"That's the hell of it. It was 
written in no language known 
anywhere on Earth. But there 



KINDERGARTEN 



29 



was one line — one line on all the 
letters — that you could read. It 
said : 'By the time you have this 
deciphered, you'll be ready to act 
logically.' And that was all anybody could read — one line in the 
native language of every country 
that got a copy of the letter. 
The rest was in gibberish, for all 
we could make of it." 

"You haven't deciphered it?" 

He could see the colonel sweating. "Not even a single character, 
much less a word." 

Peter reached out a hand to 
the bedside table and lifted the 
carafe, tipped it above the glass. 
There was nothing in it. 


 




The colonel heaved himself 
out of his chair. "I'll get you a 
drink of water." 

He picked up the glass and 
opened the bathroom door. 

"I'll let it run a while and get 
it cold," he said. 

But Peter scarcely heard -him, 
for he was staring at the door. 
There was a bolt on it and if — 

The water started running and 
the colonel raised his voice to be 
heard above it. 

"That's about the time we 
started finding the machines," 
he said. "Can you imagine it? 
A cigarette-vending machine and 
you could buy cigarettes from it, 



but it was more than that. It was 
something watching you. Something that studied the people and 
the way they lived. And the 
stamp machines and the slot machines and all the other mechanical contrivances that we have 
set up. Not machines, but watchers. Watching all the time. 
Watching and learning . . ." 

PETER swung his legs out of 
bed and touched the floor. He 
approached swiftly and silently 
on bare feet and slammed the 
door, then reached up and slid 
the bolt. It snicked neatly into 
place. 

"Hey!" the colonel shouted. 
Clothes? 

They might be in the closet. 

Peter leaped at it and wrenched 
the door open and there they 
were, hung upon the hangers. 

He ripped off the hospital 
gown, snatched at his trousers and 
pulled them on. 

Shirt, now! In a drawer. 

And shoes? There on the closet 
floor. Don't take time to tie them. 

The colonel was pushing and 
hammering at the door, not yelling yet. Later he would, but right 
now he was intent on saving all 
the face he could. He wouldn't 
want to advertise immediately 
the fact that he'd been tricked. 

Peter felt through his pockets. 
His wallet was gone. So was 
everything else — his knife, his 



KINDERGARTEN 



31 



watch, his keys. More than likely 
they'd taken all of it and put it 
in the office safe when he'd been 
brought in. 

No time to worry about any of 
them. The thing now was to get 
away. 

He went out the door and down 
the corridor, carefully not going 
too fast. He passed a nurse, but 
she scarcely glanced at him. 

He found a stairway door and 
opened it. Now he could hurry 
just a little more. He went down 
the stairs three at a time, shoelaces clattering. 

The stairs, he told himself, 
were fairly safe. Almost no one 
would use them when there were 
the elevators. He stopped and 
bent over for a moment and tied 
the laces. 

The floor numbers were painted 
above each of the doors, so he 
knew where he was. At the 
ground floor, he entered the corridor again. So far, there seemed 
to be no alarms, although any 
minute now the colonel would 
start to raise a ruckus. 

Would they try to stop him at 
the door? Would there be someone to question him? Would — 

A basket of flowers stood beside a door. He glanced up and 
down the corridor. There were 
several people, but they weren't 
looking at him. He scooped up 
the flowers. 

At the door, he said to the at


tendant who sat behind the desk: 
"Mistake. Wrong flowers." 

She smiled sourly, but made 
no move to stop him. 

Outside, he put the flowers 
down on the steps and walked 
rapidly away. 

An hour later, he knew that he 
was safe. He knew also that he 
was in a city thirty miles away 
from where he wanted to go and 
that he had no money and that 
he was hungry and his feet were 
sore from walking on the hard 
and unyielding concrete of the 
sidewalks. 

He found a park and sat down 
on a bench. A little distance 
away, a group of old men were 
playing checkers at a table. A 
mother wheeled her baby. A 
young man sat on a nearby 
bench, listening to a tiny radio. 

'"pHE radio said: ", . . apparently the building is completed. 
There has been no sign of it 
growing for the last eighteen 
hours. At the moment, it measures a thousand stories high and 
covers more than a hundred 
acres. The bomb, which was 
dropped two days ago, still floats 
there above it, held in suspension 
by some strange force. Artillery 
is standing by, waiting for the 
word to fire, but the word has 
not come through. Many think 
that since the bomb could not 
get through, shells will have no 



32 




 



better chance, if any at all. 

"A military spokesman, in fact, 
has said that the big guns are 
mere precautionary measures, 
which may be all right, but it 
certainly doesn't explain why the 
bomb was dropped. There is a 
rising clamor, not only in Congress, but throughout the world, 
to determine why an attempt was 
made at bombing. There has as 
yet been no hostile move directed 
from the building. The only damage so far reported has been the 
engulf ment by the building of 
the farm home of Peter Chaye, 
the man who found the machine. 

"All trace has been lost of 
Chaye since three days ago, when 
he suffered an attack of some sort 
and was taken from his home. It 
is believed that he may be in 
military custody. There is wide 
speculation on what Chaye may 
or may not know. It is entirely 
likely that he is the only man 
on Earth who can shed any light 
on what has happened on his 
farm. 

"Meanwhile, the military guard 
has been tightened around the 
scene and a corridor of some 
eighteen miles in depth around 
it has been evacuated. It is known 
that two delegations of scientists 
have been escorted through the 
lines. While no official announcement has been made, there is 
good reason to believe they 
learned little from their visits. 



What the building is, who or 
what has engineered its construction, if you can call the insideout process by which it grew construction, or what may be expected next are all fields of 
groundless speculation. There is 
plenty of that, naturally, but no 
one has yet come up with what 
might be called an explanation. 

"The world's press wires are 
continuing to pile up reams of 
copy, but even so there is little 
actual, concrete knowledge — few 
facts that can be listed one, two, 
three right down the line. 

"There is little other news of 
any sort and perhaps it's just as 
well, since there is no room at 
the moment in the public interest for anything else but this 
mysterious building. Strangely , 
however, there is little other news. 
As so often happens when big 
news breaks, all other events 
seem to wait for some other 
time to happen. The polio epidemic is rapidly subsiding; there 
is no major crime news. In the 
world's capitals, of course, all 
legislative action is /at a complete standstill, with the governments watching closely the 
developments at the building. 

"There is a rising feeling at 
many of these capitals that the 
building is not of mere national 
concern, that decisions regarding it must be made at an international level. The attempted 



KINDERGARTEN 



tombing has resulted in some 
argument that we, as the nation 
most concerned, cannot be trusted 
to act in a calm, dispassionate 
way, and that an objective world 
viewpoint is necessary for an intelligent handling of the situation." 

PETER got up from his bench 
and walked away. He'd been 
taken from his home three days 
ago, the radio had said. No 
wonder he was starved. 

Three days — and in that time 
the building had grown a thousand stories high and now covered a hundred acres. 

He went along, not hurrying 
too much now, his feet a heavy 
ache, his belly pinched with 
hunger. 

He had to get back to the 
building — somehow he had to get 
back there. It was a sudden need, 
realized and admitted now, but 
the reason for it, the source of it, 
was not yet apparent. It was as 
if there had been something he 
had left behind and he had to go 
and find it* Something I left behind, he thought. What could he 
have left behind ? Nothing but 
the pain and the knowledge that 
he walked with a dark companion 
and the little capsule that he 
carried in his pocket for the time 
when the pain grew too great. 

He felt in his pocket and the 
capsule was no longer there. It 



had disappeared along with his 
wallet and his pocket knife and 
watch. No matter now, he 
thought. I no longer need the 
capsule. 

He heard the hurrying footsteps behind him and there was 
an urgency about them that 
made him swing around. 

"Peter!" Mary cried out. 
"Peter, I thought I recognized 
you. I was hurrying to catch 
you." 

He stood and looked at her as 
if he did not quite believe it was 
she whom he saw. 

"Where have you been?" she 
asked. 

"Hospital," Peter said. "I ran 
away from them. But you . . ." 

"We were evacuated, Peter. 
They came and told us that we 
had to leave. Some of us are 
at a camp down at the other end 
of the park. Pa is carrying on 
something awful and I can't 
blame him — having to leave right 
in the middle of haying and with 
the small grain almost ready to 
be cut." 

She tilted back her head and 
looked into his face. 

"You look all worn out," she 
said. "Is it worse again?" 

"It?" he asked, then realized 
that the neighbors must have 
known — that the reason for his 
coming to the farm must have 
been general knowledge, for there 
were no such things as secrets in 




 



a farming neighborhood. 

"I'm sorry, Peter," Mary said. 
"Terribly sorry. I shouldn't 
have . . .*' 

"It's all "right," said Peter. 
"Because it's gone now, Mary. I 
haven't got it any more. I don't 
know how or why, but I've gotten rid of it in some way." 

"The hospital?" she suggested. 

"The hospital had nothing to 
do with it. It had cleared up before I went there. They just 
found out at the hospital, that is 
all." 

"Maybe the diagnosis was 
wrong." 

He shook his head. "It wasn't 
wrong, Mary." 

STILL, how could he be sure? 
How could he, or the medical 
world, say positively that it had 
been malignant cells and not 
something else — some strange 
parasite to which he had played 
the unsuspecting host? 

"You said you ran away," she 
reminded him. 

"They'll be looking for me, 
Mary. The colonel and the major. 
They think I had something to 
do with the machine I found. 
They think I might have made 
it. They took me to the hospital 
to find out if I was human." 
"Of all the silly things!" 
"I've got to get back to the 
farm,'* he said. "I simply have to 
get back there." 



"You can't," she told him. 
"There are soldiers everywhere." 

"I'll crawl on my belly in the 
ditches, if I have to. Travel at 
night. Sneak through the lines. 
Fight if I'm discovered and they 
try to prevent me. There is no 
alternative. I have to make a 
try." 

"You're ill," she said, anxiously staring at his face. 

He grinned at her. "Not ill. 
Just hungry." 

"Come On then." She took his 
arm. 

He held back. "Not to the 
camp. I can't have someone seeing me. In just a little while, I'll 
be a hunted man — if I'm not one 
already." 

"A restaurant, of course." 

"They took my wallet, Mary. 
I haven't any money." 

"I have shopping money." 

"No," he said. "I'll get along. 
There's nothing that can beat 
me now." 

"You really mean that, don't 
you?" 

"It just occurred to me," Peter 
admitted, confused and yet somehow sure that what he had said 
was not reckless bravado, but a 
blunt fact. 

"You're going back?" 

"I have to, Mary." 

"And you think you have a 
chance?" 

He nodded. 

"Peter," she began hesitantly. 



KINDERGARTEN 



"Yes?" 

"How much bother would I 

be?" 

"You ? How do you mean ? 
A bother in what way?" 

"If I went along." 

"But you can't. There's no 
reason for you to." 

She lifted her chin just a 
little. "There is a reason, Peter. 
Almost as if I were being called 
there. Like a bell ringing in my 
head — a school bell calling in the 
children . . ." 

"Mary," he said, "that perfume 
bottle — there was a certain symbol on it, wasn't there?" 

"Carved in the glass," she told 
him. "The same symbol, Peter, 
that was carved into the jade." 

And the same symbol, he 
thought, that had been on the 
letterheads. 

"Come on," he decided suddenly. "You won't be any bother." 

"We'll eat first," she said. "We 
can use the shopping money." 

npHEY walked down the path, 
hand in hand, like two teenage sweethearts. 

"We have lots of time," said 
Peter. "We can't start for home 
till dark." 

They ate at a small restaurant 
on an obscure street and after 
that went grocery shopping. They 
bought a loaf of bread and two 
rings of bologna and a slab of 
cheese, which took all of Mary's 

36 



money, and for the change the 
grocer sold them an empty bottle 
in which to carry water. It would 
serve as a canteen. 

They walked to the edge of the 
city and out through the suburbs 
and into the open country, not 
traveling fast, for there was no 
point in trying to go too far 
before night set in. 

They found a stream and sat 
beside it, for all the world like 
a couple on a picnic. Mary took 
off her shoes and dabbled her feet 
in the water and the two of them 
felt disproportionately happy. 

Night came and they Started 
out. There was no Moon, but the 
sky was ablaze with stars. Although they took some tumbles 
and at other times wondered 
where they were, they kept moving on, staying off the roads, 
walking through the fields and 
pastures, skirting the farm houses 
to avoid barking dogs. 

It was shortly after midnight 
that they saw the first of the 
campfires and swung wide around 
them. From the top of a ridge, 
they looked down upon the camp 
and saw the outlines of tents and 
the dull shapes of the canvascovered trucks. And, later on, 
they almost stumbled into an 
artillery outfit, but got safely 
away without encountering the 
sentries who were certain to be 
stationed around the perimeter 
of the bivouac. 


 



Now they knew that they were 
inside the evacuated area, that 
they were moving through the 
outer ring of soldiers and guns 
which hemmed in the building. 

They moved more cautiously 
and made slower time. When the 
first false light of dawn came into 
the east, they holed up in a 
dense plum thicket in the corner 
of a pasture. 

"I'm tired," sighed Mary. "I 
wasn't tired all night or, if I 
was, I didn't know it — but now 
that we've stopped, I feel exhausted." 

"We'll eat and sleep," Peter 
said. 

"Sleep comes first. I'm too 
tired to eat." 

Peter left her and crawled 
through the thicket to its edge. 

IN the growing light of morning stood the Building, a great 
blue -misted mass that reared 
above the horizon like a blunted 
finger pointing at the sky. 

"Mary!" Peter whispered. 
"Mary, there it is!" 

He heard her crawling through 
the thicket to his side. 

"Peter, it's a long way off." 

"Yes, I know it is. But we are 
going there," 

They crouched there watching 

it. 

"I can't see the bomb," said 
Mary. "The bomb that's hanging over it." 



"It's too far off to see." 

"Why is it us? Why are we the 
ones who are going back? Why 
are we the only ones who are not 
afraid?" 

"I don't know," said Peter, 
frowning puzzledly. "No actual 
reason, that is. I'm going back 
because I want to — no, because 
I have to. You see, it was the 
place I chose. The dying place. 
Like the elephants crawling off 
to die where all other elephants 
die." 

"But you're all right now, 
Peter." 

"That makes no difference — 
or it doesn't seem to. It was 
where I found peace and an understanding." 

"And there were the symbols, 
Peter. The symbols on the bottle 
and the jade." 

"Let's go back," he said. 
"Someone will spot us here." 

"Our gifts were the only ones 
that had the symbols," Mary persisted. "None of the others had 
any of them. I asked around. 
There were no symbols at all on 
the other gifts." 

"There's no time to wonder 
about that. Come on." 

They crawled back to the center of the thicket. 

The Sun had risen above the 
horizon now and sent level shafts 
of light into the thicket and 
the early morning silence hung 
over them like a benediction.

"Peter," said Mary, "I just 
can't stay awake any longer. Kiss 
me before I go to sleep." 

He kissed her and they clung 
together, shut from the world by 
the .jagged, twisted, low-growing 
branches of the plum trees. 

"I hear the bells," she breathed. 
"Do you hear them, too?" 

Peter shook his head. 

"Like school bells," she said. 
"Like bells on the first day of 
.school — the first day you ever 
went." 

"You're tired," he told her. 

"I've heard them before. This 
is not the first time." 

He kissed her again. "Go to 
sleep," he said and she did, almost as soon as she lay down 
and closed her eyes. 

He sat quietly beside her and 
his mind retreated to his own 
hidden depths, searching for the 
pain within him. But there was 
no pain. It was gone forever. 

The pain was gone and the incidence of polio was down and 
it was a crazy thing to think, 
but he thought it, anyhow: v 

Missionary! 

7" HEN human missionaries 
went out to heathen lands, 
what were the first things that 
they did? 

They preached, of course, but 
there were other things as well. 
They fought disease and they 
worked for sanitation and labored 

38 



to improve the welfare of the 
people and tried to educate them 
to a better way of life. And in 
this way they not only carried 
out their religious precepts, but 
gained the confidence of the 
heathen folk as well. 

And if an alien missionary 
came to Earth, what would be 
among the first things that he 
was sure to do? Would it not be 
reasonable that he, too, would 
fight disease and try to improve 
the welfare of his chosen charges? 
Thus he would gain their confidence. Although he could not 
expect to gain too much at first. 
He could expect hostility and 
suspicion. Only a pitiful handful 
would not resent him or be 
afraid of him. 

And if the missionary — 

And if THIS missionary — 

Peter fell asleep. 

The roar awakened him and 
he sat upright, sleep entirely 
wiped from his mind. 

The roar still was there, somewhere outside the thicket, but it 
was receding. 

"Peter! Peter!" 

"Quiet, Mary! There is something out there!" 

The roar turned around and 
came back again, growing until 
it was the sound of clanking 
thunder and the Earth shook with 
the sound. It receded again. 

The midday sunlight came 
down through the branches and 



made of their hiding place a 
freckled spot of Sun and shade. 
Peter could smell the musky 
odor of warm soil and wilted leaf. 

They crept cautiously through 
the thicket and when they gained 
its edge, where the leaves thinned 
out, they saw the racing tank far 
down the field. Its roar came to 
them as it tore along, bouncing 
and swaying to the ground's 
unevenness, the great snout of 
its cannon pugnaciously thrust 
out before it, like a stiff -arming 
football player. 

A road ran clear down the field 
— a road that Peter was sure had 
not been there the night before. 
It was a straight road, absolutely 
straight, running toward the 
building, and it was of some 
metallic stuff that shimmered in 
the Sun. 

And far off to the left was another road and to the right another, and in the distance the 
three roads seemed to draw together, as the rails seem to converge when one looks down a 
railroad track. 

Other roads running at right 
angles cut across the three roads, 
intersecting them so that one 
gained the impression of three 
far-reaching ladders set tightly 
side by side. 

*TpHE tank raced toward one of 
the intersecting roads, a tank 
made midget by the distance, 



and its roar came back to them 
no louder than the humming of 
an angry bee. 

It reached the road and skidded 
off, whipping around sidewise and 
slewing along, as if it had hit 
something smooth and solid that 
it could not get through, as if 
it might have struck a soaped 
metallic wall. There was a moment when it tipped and almost 
went over, but it stayed upright 
and finally backed away, then 
swung around to come lumbering 
down the field, returning toward 
the thicket. 

Halfway down the field, it 
pivoted around and halted, so 
that the gun pointed back toward 
the intersecting road. 

The gun's muzzle moved downward and flashed and, at the intersecting road, the shell exploded 
with a burst of light and a puff 
of smoke. The concussion of the 
shot slapped hard against the 
ear. 

Again and again the gun 
belched out its shells pointblank. 
A haze of smoke hung above the 
tank and road — and the shells 
still exploded at the road — this 
side of the road and not beyond 
it. 

The tank clanked forward once 
more until it reached the road. 
It approached carefully this time 
and nudged itself along, as if 
it might be looking for a way to 
cross.

From somewhere a long distance off came the crunching 
sound of artillery. An entire battery of guns seemed to be firing. 
They fired for a while, then 
grudgingly quit. 

The tank still nosed along the 
road like a dog sniffing beneath 
a fallen tree for a hidden rabbit. 

"There's something there that's 
stopping them," said Peter. 

"A wall," Mary guessed. "An 
invisible wall of some sort, but 
one they can't get through." 

"Or shoot through, either. They 
tried to break through with gunfire and they didn't even dent it." 

He crouched there, watching as 
the tank nosed along the road. It 
reached the point where the road 
to the left came down to intersect 
the crossroad. The tank sheered 
off to follow the left-hand one, 
bumping along with its forward 
armor shoved against the unseen 
wall. 

Boxed in, thought Peter — those 
roads have broken up and boxed 
in all the military units. A tank 
in one pen and a dozen tanks in 
another, a battery of artillery 
in another, the motor pool in yet 
another. Boxed in and trapped; 
penned up and useless. 

And we, he wondered — are we 
boxed in as well? 

A group of soldiers came 
tramping down the right-hand 
road. Peter spotted them from 
far off, black dots moving down 



the road, heading east, away 
from the building. When they 
came closer, he saw that they 
carried no guns and slogged along 
without the slightest semblance 
of formation and he could see 
from the way they walked that 
they were dog-tired. 

TTE had not been aware that 
Mary had left his side until 
she came creeping back again, 
ducking her head to keep her 
hair from being caught in the lowhanging branches. 

She sat down beside him and 
handed him a thick slice of bread 
and a chunk of bologna. She set 
the bottle of water down between 
them. 

"It was the building," she said, 
"that built the roads." 

Peter nodded, his mouth full 
of bread and meat. 

"They want to make it easy 
to get to the building," Mary 
said. "The building wants to 
make it easy for people to come 
and visit it." 

"The bells again?" he asked. 

She smiled and said, "The 
bells." 

The soldiers now had come 
close enough to see the tank. 
They stopped and stood in the 
road, looking at it. 

Then four of them turned off 
the road and walked out into the 
field, heading for the tank. The 
others sat down and waited.

"The wall only works one 
way," said Mary. 

"More likely," Peter told her, 
"it works for tanks, but doesn't 
work for people." 

"The building doesn't want to 
keep the people out.'* 

The soldiers crossed the Seld 
and the tank came out to meet 
them. It stopped and the crew 
crawled out of it and climbed 
down. The soldiers and the crew 
stood talking and one of the 
soldiers kept swinging his arms in 
gestures, pointing here and there. 

From far away came the sound 
of heavy guns again. 

"Some of them," said Peter, 
"still are trying to blast down the 
walls." 

Finally the soldiers and the 
tank crew walked back to the 
road, leaving the tank deserted in 
the field. 

And that must be the way it 
was with the entire military force 
which had hemmed in the building, Peter told himself. The roads 
and walls had cut it into bits, 
had screened it off — and now the 
tanks and the big guns and the 
planes were just so many ineffective toys of an infant race, 
lying scattered in a thousand 
playpens. 

Out on the road, the foot 
soldiers and the tank crew slogged 
eastward, retreating from the 
siege which had failed so ingloriously. 



IN their thicket, Mary and Peter 
sat and watched the Building. 

"You said they came from the 
stars," said Mary. "But why did 
they come here? Why did they 
bother with us? Why did they 
come at all?" 

"To save us," Peter offered 
slowly. "To save us from ourselves. Or to exploit and enslave 
us. Or to use our planet as a 
military base. For any one of 
a hundred reasons. Maybe for a 
reason we couldn't understand 
even if they told us." 

"You don't believe those other 
reasons, the ones about enslaving 
us or using Earth as a military 
base. If you believed that, we 
wouldn't be going to the building." 

"No, I don't believe them. I 
don't because I had cancer and 
I haven't any longer. I don't because the polio began clearing 
up on the same day that they arrived. They're doing good for us, 
exactly the same as the missionaries did good among the primitive, disease-ridden people to 
whom they were assigned. I 
hope — " 

He sat and stared across the 
field, at the trapped and deserted 
tank, at the shining ladder of the 
roads. 

"I hope," he said, "they don't 
do what some of the missionaries 
did. I hope they don't destroy 
our self-respect with alien Mother

Hubbards. I hope they don't 
save us from ringworm and condemn us to a feeling of racial 
inferiority. I hope they don't chop 
down the coconuts and hand 
us — " 

But they know about us, he 
told himself. They know all there 
is to know. They've studied us 
for — -how long? Squatting in a 
drugstore corner, masquerading 
as a Cigarette machine. Watching us from the counter in the 
guise of stamp machine. 

And they wrote letters — letters 
to every head of state in all the 
world. Letters that might, when 
finally deciphered, explain what 
they were about. Or that might 
make certain demands. Or that 
might, just possibly, be no more 
than applications for permits to 
build a mission or a church or a 
hospital or a school. 

They know us, he thought. 
They know, for example, that 
we're suckers for anything that's 
free, so they handed out free 
gifts — just like the quiz shows 
and contests run by radio and 
television and Chambers of Commerce, except that there was no 
competition and everybody won. 

Throughout the afternoon, 
Peter and Mary watched the road 
and during that time small groups 
of soldiers had come limping 
down it. But now, for an hour or 
more, there had been no one on 
the road. 



THEY started out just before 
dark, walking across the field, 
passing through the wall-thatwasn't-there to reach the road. 
And they headed west along the 
road, going toward the purple 
cloud of the building that reared 
against the redness of the sunset. 

They traveled through the 
night and they did not have to 
dodge and hide, as they had that 
first night, for there was no one 
on the road except the one lone 
soldier they met. 

By the time they saw him, they 
had come far enough so that the 
great shaft of the building loomed halfway up the sky, a smudge 
of misty brightness in the bright 
starlight. 

The soldier was sitting in the 
middle of the road and he'd 
taken off his shoes and set them 
neatly beside him. 

"My feet are killing me," he 
said by way of greeting. 

So they sat down with him to 
keep him company and Peter 
took out the water bottle and the 
loaf of bread and the cheese and 
bologna and spread them on the 
pavement with wrapping paper 
as a picnic cloth. 

They ate in silence for a while 
and finally the soldier said, "Well, 
this is the end of it." 

They did not ask the question, 
but waited patiently, eating 
bread and cheese. 

"This is the end of soldiering," 



42 




 



the soldier told them. "This is 
the end of war." 

He gestured out toward the 
pens fashioned by the roads and 
in one nearby pen were three 
self - propelled artillery pieces 
and in another was an ammunition dump and another pen held 
military vehicles. 

"How are you going to fight a 
war," the soldier asked, "if the 
things back there can chop up 
your armies into checkerboards? 
A tank ain't worth a damn guarding ten acres, not when it isn't 
able to get out of those ten acres. 
A big gun ain't any good to you 
if you can't fire but half a mile." 

"You think they would?" asked Mary. "Anywhere, I mean?" 

"They done it here. Why not 
somewhere else? Why not any 
place that they wanted to? They 
stopped us. They stopped us cold 
and they never shed a single drop 
of blood. Not a casualty among 
us." 

He swallowed the bit of bread 
and cheese that was in his mouth 
and reached for the water bottle. 
He drank, his Adam's apple bobbing up and down. 

"I'm coming back," he said. 
"I'm going out and get my girl 
and we both are coming back. 
The things in that building maybe need some help and I'm going 
to help them if there's a way of 
doing it. And if they don't need 
no help, why, then I'm going to 



figure out some way to let them 
know I'm thankful that they 
came." 

"Things? You saw some 
things?" 

The soldier stared at Peter. 
"No, I never saw anything at all." 

"But this business of going out 
to get your girl and both of you 
coming back? How did you get 
that idea? Why not go back right 
now with us?" 

"It wouldn't be right," the soldier protested. "Or it doesn't 
seem just right. I got to see her 
first and tell her how I feel. Besides, I got a present for her." 

"She'll be glad to see you," 
Mary told him softly. "She'll like 
the present." 

"She sure will." The soldier 
grinned proudly. "It was something that she wanted." 

TTE reached in his pocket and 
took out a leather box. Fumbling with the catch, he snapped 
it open. The starlight blazed softly on the necklace that lay inside the box. 

Mary reached out her hand. 
"May I?" she asked. 

"Sure," the soldier said. "I 
want you to take a look at it. 
You'd know if a girl would like 
it." 

Mary lifted it from the box 
and held it in her hand, a stream 
of starlit fire. 

"Diamonds?" asked Peter.

"i don't know," the soldier 
said. "Might be. It looks real expensive. There's a pendant, sort 
of, at the bottom of it, of green 
stone that doesn't sparkle much, 
but — " 

"Pete r," Mary interrupted, 
"have you got a match?" 

The soldier dipped his hand 
into a pocket. "I got a lighter, 
miss. That thing gave me a lighter. A beaut!" 

He snapped it open and the 
blaze flamed out. Mary held the 
pendant close. 

"It's the symbol," she said. 
"Just like on my bottle of perfume." 

"That carving?" asked the soldier, pointing. "It's on the lighter, 
too." 

"Something gave you this?" 
Peter urgently wanted to know. 

"A box. Except that it really 
was more than a box. I reached 
down to put my hand on it and 
it coughed up a lighter and when 
it did, I thought of Louise and 
the lighter she had given me. I'd 






lost it and I felt bad about it, 
and here was one just like it except for the carving on the side. 
And when I thought of Louise, 
the box made a funny noise and 
out popped the box with the 
necklace in it." 

The soldier leaned forward, his 
young 'face solemn in the glow 
from the lighter's flame. 

"You know what I think?" he 
said. "I think that box was one 
of them. There are stories, but 
you can't believe everything you 
hear . . 

He looked from one to the 
other of them. "You don't laugh 
at me," he remarked wonderingly. 

Peter shook his head. "That's 
about the last thing we'd do, Soldier." 

Mary handed back the necklace and the lighter. The soldier 
put them in his pocket and began putting on his shoes. 

"I got to get on," he said. 
"Thanks for the chow." 

"We'll be seeing you," said 
Peter.

"I hope so." 

"I know we will," Mary stated 
positively. 

They watched him trudge 
away, then walked on in the 
other direction. 

jifARY said to Peter, "The 
symbol is the mark of them. 
The ones who get the symbol are 
the ones who will go back. It's a 
passport, a seal of approval." 

"Or," Peter amended, "the 
brand of ownership." 

"They'd be looking for certain 
kinds of people. They wouldn*t 
want anybody who was afraid of 
them. They'd want people who 
had some faith in them." 

"What do they want us for?" 
Peter fretted. "That's what bothers me. What use can we be to 
them? The soldier wants to help 
them, but they don't need 
help from us. They don't need 
help from anyone." 

"We've never seen one of 
them," said Mary. "Unless the 
box was one of them." 

And the cigarette machines, 
thought Peter. The cigarette machines and God knows what else. 

"And yet," said Mary, "they 
know about us. They've watched 
us and studied us. They know us 
inside out. They can reach deep 
within us and know what each of 
might want and then give it to 
us. A rod and reel for Johnny 
and a piece of jade for you. And 

46 l 



the rod and reel were a human 
rod and reel and the jade was 
Earth jade. They even know 
about the soldier's girl. They 
knew she would like a shiny 
necklace and they knew she was 
the kind of person that they 
wanted to come back again and 

"The Saucers," Peter said. "I 
wonder if it was the Saucers, 
after all, watching us for years, 
learning all about us." 

How many years would it take, 
he wondered, from a standing 
start, to learn all there was to 
know about the human race? For 
it would be from a standing start ; 
to them, all of humanity would 
have been a complex alien race 
and they would have had to feel 
their way along, learning one fact 
here and another there. And they 
would make mistakes; at times 
their deductions would be wrong, 
and that would set them back. 

"I don't know," said Peter. "I 
can't figure it out at all." 

They walked down the shiny 
metal road that glimmered in 
the starlight, with the building 
growing from a misty phantom 
to a gigantic wall that rose against 
the sky to blot out the stars. A 
thousand stories high and coveri ing more than a hundred acres, 
it was a structure that craned 
i your head and set your neck to 
aching and made your brain spin 
I with its glory and its majesty. 


 



And even when you drew near 
it, you could not see the dropped 
and cradled bomb, resting in the 
emptiness above it, for the bomb 
was too far away for seeing. 

But you could see the little 
cubicles sliced off by the roads 
and, within the cubicles, the destructive toys of a violent race, 
deserted now, just idle hunks of 
fashioned metal. 

*T*HEY came at last, just before 
dawn, to the great stairs that 
ran up to the central door. As 
they moved across the flat stone 
approach to the stairs, they felt 
the hush and the deepness of the 
peace that lay in the building's 
shadow. 

Hand in hand, they went up 
the stairs and came to the great 
bronze door and there they stopped. Turning around, they looked back in silence. 

The roads spun out like wheel 
spokes from the building's hub 
as far as they could see, and the 
crossing roads ran in concentric 
circles so that it seemed they 
stood in the center of a spider's 
web. 

Deserted farm houses, with 
their groups of buildings — barns, 
granaries, garages, silos, hog pens, 
machine sheds — stood in the sectors marked off by the roads, and 
in other sectors lay the machines 
of war, fit now for little more 
than birds' nests or a hiding 



place for rabbits. Bird songs came 
trilling up from the pastures and 
the fields and you could smell 
the freshness and the coolness 
of the countryside. 

"It's good," said Mary. "Ifs 
our country, Peter." 

"It was our country," Peter 
corrected her. "Nothing will ever 
be quite the same again." 

"You aren't afraid, Peter?" 

"Not a bit. Just baffled." 

"But you seemed so sure before." 

"I still am sure," he said. 
"Emotionally, I am as sure as 
ever that everything's all right." 

"Of course everything's all 
right. There was a polio epidemic 
and now it has died out. An army 
has been routed without a single 
death. An atomic bomb was 
caught and halted before it could 
go off. Can't you see, Peter, 
they're already making this a 
better world. Cancer and polio 
gone — two things that Man had 
fought for years and was far 
from conquering. War stopped, 
disease stopped, atomic bombs 
stopped — things we couldn't solve 
for ourselves that were solved for 
us." 

"I know all that," said Peter. 
"They'll undoubtedly also put an 
end to crime and graft and violence and everything else that has 
been tormenting and degrading 
mankind since it climbed down 
out of the trees."

"What more do you want?" 

"Nothing more, I guess — it's 
just that it's circumstantial. 
It's not real evidence. All that we 
know, or think we know, we've 
learned from inference. We have 
no proof — no actual, solid proof." 

"We have faith. We must have 
faith. If you can't believe in 
someone or something that wipes 
out disease and war, what can 
you believe in?" 

"That's what bothers me." 

"The world is built on faith," 
said Mary. "Faith in God and in 
ourselves and in the decency of 
mankind." 

"You're wonderful," exclaimed 
Peter. 

He caught her tight and kissed 
her and she clung against him 
and when finally they let each 
other go, the great bronze door 
was opening. 

SILENTLY, they walked across 
the threshold with arms 
around each other, into a foyer 
that arched high overhead. There 
were murals on the high arched 
ceiling, and others paneled in 
the walls, and four great flights 
of stairs led upward. 

But the stairways were roped 
off by heavy velvet cords. Another cord, hooked into gleaming 
standards, and signs with pointing arrows showed them which 
way to go. 

Obediently, walking in the hush 



that came close to reverence, they 
went across the foyer to the single open door. 

They stepped into a large 
room, with great, tall, slender 
windows that let in the morning 
sunlight, and it fell across the 
satiny newness of the blackboards, the big-armed class 
chairs, the heavy reading tables, 
case after case of books, and the 
lectern on the lecture platform. 

They stood and looked at it 
and Mary said to Peter: "I was 
right. They were school bells, 
after all. We've come to school, 
Peter. The first day we ever went 
to school." 

"Kindergarten," Peter said, and 
his voice choked as he pronounced the word. 

It was just right, he thought, 
so humanly right: The sunlight 
and the shadow, the rich bindings of the books, the dark patina 
of the wood, the heavy silence 
over everything. It was an 
Earthly classroom in the most 
scholarly tradition. It was Cambridge and Oxford and the Sorbonne and an Eastern ivy college 
all rolled into one. 

The aliens hadn't missed a bet 
— not a single bet. 

"I have to go ," sai d Mary . 
"You wait right here for me." 

"I'll wait right here," he promised. 

He watched her cross the room 
and open a door. Through it, he 



48 




 



saw a corridor that went on for 
what seemed miles and miles. 
Then she shut the door and he 
was alone. 

He stood there for a moment, 
then swung swiftly around. Almost running across the foyer, 
he reached the great bronze door. 
But there was no door, or none 
that he could see. There was not 
even a crack where a door should 
be. He went over the wall inch 
by inch and he found no door. 

He turned away from the wall 
and stood in the foyer, naked of 
soul, and felt the vast emptiness 
of the building thunder in his 
brain. 

Up there, he thought, up there 
for a thousand stories, the building stretched into the sky. And 
down here was kindergarten and 
up on the second floor, no doubt, 
first grade, and you'd go up and 
up and what would be the end 
— and the purpose of that end? 

When did you graduate? 

Or did you ever graduate? 

And when you graduated, what 
would you be? 

What would you be? he asked. 

Would you be human still? 

HpHEY would be coming to 
school for days, the ones who 
had been picked, the ones who 
had passed the strange entrance 
examination that was necessary 
to attend this school. They'd 
come down the metal roads and 



climb the steps and the great 
bronze door would open and they 
would enter. And others would 
come, too, out of curiosity, but if 
they did not have the symbol, 
the doors would not open for 
them. 

And those who did come in, 
when and if they felt the urge to 
flee, would find there were no 
doors. 

He went back into the classroom and stood where he had 
stood before. 

Those books, he wondered. 
What was in them? In just a little 
while, he'd have the courage to 
pick one out and see. And the 
lectern? What would stand behind the lectern? 

What, not who. 

The door opened and Mary 
came across the room to him. 

"There are apartments out 
there," she said. "The cutest 
apartments you have ever seen. 
And one of them has our names 
on it and there are others that 
have other names and some that 
have no names at all. There are 
other people coming, Peter. We 
were just a little early. We were 
the ones who started first. We 
got here before the school bell 
rang." 

Peter nodded. "Let's sit down 
and wait," he said. 

Side by side, they sat down, 
waiting for the Teacher.

££f ■ ^ELL him," said Commander Lowndes' voice, 
U , speaking from the great 
exploration ship stationed on the 
other side of the world, "that 
we're recording it officially as 
Hulman's Planet. I think that 
might please him." 

Marder hesitated with his reply. Through the viewport of the 
parked little scout flier, he looked 
out at the vast, shadowy valley 
before him, at green and scarlet 
swamps, at gleaming dark waters 
threaded through them. A huge, 
blue-wooded wave of mountains 
rose beyond, the setting sun just 
touching their crest. In a quarter 
of an hour, it would be completely dark. His glance turned, 
almost reluctantly, to the substantial but incongruous reality of 
Hulman's house nearby, its upper 
story and roof mirrored in the 
tiny swamp lake. 

"No, it wouldn't please him," 
he said. "Boyce suggested it during our first visit with Hulman 
today. He wants us to record it 
instead as — I'll spell it — C-r-e-sg-y-t-h. Cresgyth. That's his 
phonetic interpretation of the 



name given it by the people here." 

"Fair enough," Commander 
Lowndes agreed, "if that's how 
he wants it." He inquired whether 
Marder had anything to add to 
the present report. 

"Not now," Marder said. "I'll 
call you back after we've met 
his woman." 

"T¥IS wife," Lowndes corrected 
him carefully. "I'm glad it 
happened to be you and Boyce 
who found Hulman. You're reliable men; you in particular, 
Marder. I don't need to emphasize that Hulman's chance discovery of what appears to be the 
first genuine human race ever 
encountered outside of Earth is 
of primary importance . . ." He 
continued to emphasize that obvious fact at some length. "Boyce 
might be inclined to hurry 
through the — ah, diplomatic 
overtures," he concluded. "You'll 
be careful about that part of it, 
Marder?" 

"Very careful," Marder promised. 

"On the two continents we've 
scanned so far, we've found no

traces of human inhabitants, present or past. It's possible that 
Hulman's acquaintances are the 
sole survivors of humanity here. 
If we frighten the tribe into hiding, there may never be another 
contact — and within a hundred 
years or less, they may have become extinct." 

"I understand." 

"Fine. Now, then — what about 
these other creatures? What did 
Hulman have to say about 
them?" 

"In the twenty years he's been 
marooned in this valley, he's had 
only three or four actual encounters with them — rather violent encounters, on his side. 
Apparently, they learned to avoid 
him after that. He seems," Marder added thoughtfully, "to have 
an almost psychopathic hatred 
for them." 

"Not very surprising!" 
Lowndes' tone was reproving, reminding Marder that Hulman 
had been, for the past forty years, 
one of the great, legendary names 
of stellar exploration. "Deems' 
scout reports it bagged a couple 
of specimens a few hours ago and 
is bringing them in. The description checks with what Hulman 
gave you — a wormlike, blue body 
with a set of arms, legs, and a 
head. Out of water, they appear 
to wear some kind of clothes, 
presumably to conserve body 
moisture." 



Marder agreed that it checked. 

"We've found them remarkably elusive otherwise," Lowndes 
went on. "There seems to have 
been a widespread rudimentary 
civilization along the seas and 
major lake coasts — amphibious 
cave-builders is what they were 
originally. But all the caves we 
examined have been deserted for 
centuries, at least, which indicates 
major migratory movements of 
the species inland. The seas and 
lakes are almost completely barren of life above the plankton 
level." 

There had been, according to 
Hulman, some kind of planetary 
catastrophe, Marder said. Hunger 
had driven the "snakes," as he 
called them, out of the great lake 
chains of their origin, up into 
the valley swamp lands and along 
the river courses, forcing the 
remnants of the mysterious human race ahead of them in their 
slow migration and gradually reducing the human living area . 
Hulman had killed six of the 
bluish, wormlike creatures in this 
section of the valley, in the first 
few years after he had crashed on 
the planet; after that, they had 
ceased to show up here. But, until 
now, he had been unable to give 
the humans more effective help. 

A FTER Lowndes cut contact, 
Marder remained sitting in 
the scout for a time, gazing out at 



52 




 



the vast, darkening valley with 
troubled, puzzled eyes. For twenty-two years after the destruction 
of his ship, Hulman had lived 
here, separated from the humanity of his origin by an enormity of 
light-years, by the black abyss of 
space, but in the company of a 
woman who was of an alien, 
dying race. 

"My wife!" Hulman had said, 
not defiantly but proudly, in 
speaking of her. "I called her 
Celia from the start, and she 
liked the name," 

Hidden somewhere in the shadowed swamps, the woman he'd 
called Celia was watching Hulman's great log house until she 
could overcome her timidity of 
the visitors from space. 

"She'll show up some time during the night," Hulman had 
laughed. "I'm leaving the doors 
open for her. I'll talk to her a 
little first, to reassure her, and 
you can meet her then. Meanwhile, why don't you have a look 
at her picture." 

Years ago, as a boy, Marder 
had first seen Hulman's early 
paintings of the outer worlds and, 
like countless thousands of others 
before and since, he had felt his 
imagination swell and grow wide 
with the cosmic grandeur of Hulman's vision of universal life. 

In the fifty or so paintings he 
had seen in the log house that 
day, the great sweep of space had 



dwindled to something apparently much more commonplace. 
Hulman's imagination seemed to 
have shrunk to correspond to the 
physical limitations of the valley that confined him. However, 
he had retained a characteristic 
and extraordinary precision of 
lifelike detail, particularly in regard to the human beings he had 
found here. 

They were beautiful creatures; 
but the paintings aroused a revulsion in Marder, in which he 
recognized a vague flavoring of 
terror. In the one painting Hulman showed them of the woman 
Celia, that effect was particularly 
pronounced. Marder found it difficult to explain to himself. Boyce 
seemed insensitive to it, and there 
was nothing in Hulman's words 
or attitude to provide additional 
clues. 

Re-entering the house, Marder 
glanced back with more than a 
trace of uneasiness at the swamp 
from the doors Hulman had left 
open. After twenty years, Hulman should know whether danger 
threatened him from there; but 
for a visitor on a strange world, 
"it" and "they" were always 
present in the unknown dark outside — fears that usually were 
imaginary, but sometimes were 
not. 

Marder smiled a little grimly 
at his own present apprehensions 
and went in.

HE found Hulman and Boyce 
in a cavernous cellar level 
beneath the house itself. It was 
well lit and showed familiar and 
reassuring features; power plants, 
storage rooms, even a hydroponic 
garden. The two men stood beside 
the opening of a deep fresh-water 
well, twenty feet across, which 
took up the left side of the main 
cellar hall. 

"Sixty feet down, it's ten degrees Fahrenheit," Hulman was 
stating, with a disarming houseowner's pride. He was a big man, 
rather heavy now, with a squarecut brown beard that showed only 
a few traces of gray. "I got the 
idea from Celia's people. Swamp 
water's none too healthy here at 
various seasons, but the well taps 
an underground river that's as 
pure as you could wish — " He 
caught sight of Marder. "Any 
news?" His face had become suddenly anxious. 

"They're going to wait over 
there with the ship," Marder 
said, "a week or more, if required. 
We're to follow your judgment 
in every way in establishing contact with the Cresgythians." 

"Good!" Hulman was obviously relieved. "We can't do anything till Celia comes in — and 
we'll have to be very tactful then. 
But I'm sure it won't take a 
week." 

"What makes them so shy of 
us?" Boyce inquired. 



A shadow passed over Hulman's face. "It's not you," he 
said. "It's me ... Or it's an impression I gave them of the Earth 
kind of human beings." 

Back upstairs, with the three 
of them settled comfortably in 
the big living room, he explained. 
He'd given Boyce and Marder a 
room together on the top floor of 
the house, across a small hall 
from his own room and that of 
his wife. 

"I've never asked Celia much 
about her people," he said. 
"There's some kind of very strong 
taboo that keeps her from talking 
about them. When I tried to press 
her for details at first, it was almost as if I were committing some 
sort of gross indecency. But I do 
know they hate violence, insanity 
— anything unbeautiful! And, you 
see . . ." 

When his ship crashed into the 
valley, he was the only man left 
alive on her out of the original 
crew of four. "Banning went insane two days before that and 
killed Nichols and Dawson," he 
said, his face drawn and taut, remembering it again over a period 
of twenty-two years. He paused. 
"And so I killed Banning before 
he could wreck the ship completely." He looked from one to 
the other of them. "Jt was unavoidable. But they never understood that, these people of Celia's." 




 



"How did they find out?" Marder stirred uncomfortably. 

Hulman shrugged. "I was unconscious for about a month and 
completely blind for six months 
afterward. They got me out of 
the wreck and nursed me back to 
life, but as soon as I was out of 
danger, only Celia would stay 
with me. She and I were alone 
for weeks before I regained my 
sight. How did they find out? 
They're sensitive in a number of 
ways. And there were those bodies 
in the ship. They — withdrew from 
me," he said with a grimace, "as 
soon as I no longer needed their 
help." 

"Then in all this time," Marder 
said slowly, "you never were 
able to gain their confidence?" 

Hulman stared at him a moment, apparently weighing the 
words. "It's not a question of confidence," he said finally. "It's a 
question of — well, I'm trying to 
tell you! I didn't mind being 
alone with Celia." He grinned 
suddenly, almost boyishly. "The 
others stayed in a small lake village they had a couple of miles 
up the valley, across the swamps. 
Celia went up there every few 
days, but she never brought anyone back with her. I suspected it 
was simply because I was an 
alien. I thought they'd get over 
that in time. Celia seemed happy 
enough, so it wasn't a very acute 
problem — " 



He paused a few seconds, 
frowning. "One day, when she'd 
slipped away again, I remembered a pair of field glasses I'd taken 
off the ship, and I got them and 
trained them on the village. That 
was a very curious experience — 
I never have found a complete 
explanation for it. For just one 
instant, I had everything in the 
clearest possible focus. There 
were children playing on the platforms above the water ; a few 
adults standing in the doorway of 
a house. And, suddenly, everything blurred!" Hulman gave a 
short hacking laugh. "Can you 
imagine that? They didn't want 
me to look at them, so they just 
blurred my vision!" 

"Eh?" Boyce was frowning. 

Marder sat still, startled, feeling the uneasiness growing up in 
him again. 

Hulman smiled crookedly. 
"That's all I can tell you. The 
glasses had a four-mile range and 
they were functioning perfectly, 
but the instant I turned them on 
the village, the field blurred. I'd 
never felt so wholeheartedly — and 
successfully — snubbed before." 

TJOYCE laughed uncomfortably and glanced at Marder. 
He was still more than a little in 
awe of Hulman, of the shining 
legend miraculously resurrected 
from the black tomb of space; 
but he, too, Marder decided, had 



CARETAKER 



55 



the vague sense of something disturbing and out of order here. 
Well, so much the better. There 
would be two of them to look out 
for trouble, if trouble came. 

"1*11 admit the trick annoyed 
me," Hulman said, "as soon as 
I'd got over my first surprise at 
it. Next day, I announced to 
Celia that I was going over to the 
village. She made no objection, 
but she followed me at a distance 
— probably to make sure I didn't 
drown on the way. It's wet going 
around here. At last I came over 
a rise and found myself a hundred yards from the village, on 
the land side. Almost immediately, I realized they had abandoned 
it. I walked around it a while and 
found cooking fires still glowing; 
but nobody had waited to receive 
me. So I went home, insulted 
and very sulky — I wouldn't even 
talk to Celia until the next morning!" 

He laughed. "I got over that in 
a hurry. And then I settled down 
to building us a house of our 
own, much bigger and better than 
anything they had in the village; 
and. that took up all my time for 
several months. For that whole 
period, I ignored our neighbors 
quite as thoroughly as they had 
ignored me." 

He grinned at his guests a little 
shamefacedly. "But you know, 
I couldn't keep it up then'. There 
was something so curiously hap


py and peaceful about them, even 
if they were giving me the cold 
shoulder. And the one good look 
I'd had of them had showed me 
they were physically the most 
beautiful people I'd ever seen. 
One day, when Celia was gone, I 
made another trip to the village — 
with exactly the same results as 
the first one. So I decided to look 
around for a less exclusive neighborhood. 

"I'd got the little flier of my 
ship repaired enough to take it 
off the ground and set it down 
again; and I calculated I'd salvaged enough fuel for at least 
one twenty-four-hour trip. Celia 
watched me take off. I flew high 
over the village and could see 
them down there, ignoring me as 
usual. Then I flew down the valley for almost fifty miles before 
I came across the first colony of 
the other ones — the snakes!" 

TIMARDER remembered something Lowndes had said. 
"Do the snakes live in caves?" 

"No!" Hulman said distastefully. "That* s what fooled me. It 
was a village of stake houses set 
into the head of a little lake, almost like the one here. I set down 
on the lake, coasted up to the 
village, climbed up a ladder, and 
saw themt" 

He shuddered. "They just stood 
there, very quietly, watching me 
from the doors and windows. 



56 




 



What made it worse somehow was 
that they wore clothes — but the 
clothes didn't cover enough. 
Those weaving, soft, blue bodies 
and staring eyes! I backed off 
down the ladder, with my gun 
ready, in case they rushed me; 
but they never moved . . ." 

He had found eight more colonies of the snakes farther down 
the valley, but no trace of another 
tribe of his beautiful humanoids. 
He flew up the valley then, high 
up into the mountains, almost exhausting his fuel; and beside a 
glacier-fed mountain lake was a 
tiny stake village, built into the 
water. And they were snakes 
again. 

"At the time, I didn't know 
just what to make of it. There 
was the possibility that my village represented an advance 
troop of human beings into a land 
of snakes. But I suspected— I felt 
— even then, that it was the other 
way around; that it was the 
snakes that were encroaching on 
the humans. So I swore to myself 
that as long as I lived, at least, 
human beings were going to hold 
this section of the valley undisturbed "and in safety. 

"When I came back, I said to 
Celia — she was standing at the 
same spot I'd seen her last, as if 
she'd never left it — 'Celia, I must 
speak to your people. Go tell 
them I will come again tomorrow 
and that they must not run 

CARETAKER 



away.' She looked at me silently 
for a long time, and then she 
turned and left in the direction 
of the village. She came back 
late at night and crept into my 
arms and said, 'They have promised to wait for you.' 

"I set out next morning, full 
of great plans. The snakes lived 
in widely scattered settlements, 
after all. The villagers and I 
could wipe out those settlements 
one by one, until we'd cleared the 
land about us ! That was the natural solution, wasn't it? I didn't 
realize then how diff erent, in 
some ways, Celia's people were 
from us!" 

DOYCE asked uneasily, "What 
happened?" 

"What happened?" Hulman repeated. "Well, I came over that 
rise, and there the village was. 
This time I knew they'd stayed 
at home! Then, not twenty feet 
off my path, I saw two of the 
snakes standing in the bushes, 
one watching me, the other looking at the village. Each had a 
kind of chunky crossbow across 
his shoulders; and they couldn't 
be seen from the village . . ." 

He paused and shook his head. 
"So I shot them both down, before they got over their surprise. 
That was all." He looked from 
one to the other again. "It was 
the natural thing to .do, wasn't 
it?" 

57 



Boyce nodded uncertainly. 
Marder said nothing. 

Hulman leaned forward. "But 
apparently, from the point of 
vieyf of the villagers, it wasn't! 
Because when I was done with 
the snakes— one of them took 
three shots before it would lie 
still — the village was empty 
again. When I got back home, 
I was actually sick with disappointment. And then I discovered 
that Celia was gone! 

"That was a bad three days. 
But she came back then. And on 
the morning she came back, I 
discovered they'd broken up the 
village overnight and moved on. 
I think they're not more than ten 
or twenty miles distant from 
here, but I never tried to look 
them up again." 

Boyce said puzzled, "But I 
don't see — " 

"Neither did I," Hulman interrupted,, "until it was too late!" 
He gave his short bark of laughter again; there was, Marder realized, a sort of suppressed fury 
in it. "They won't kill their enemies — they're too polite for that! 
So their enemies are gradually 
squeezing them out of existence." 

The three men studied each 
other in silence for a moment. 
Then Marder asked slowly, "Captain Hulman, what do you expect 
us to do in this situation?" 

"Kill the snakes!" Hulman said 
promptly. "As many as we can 



find ! If the human beings of this 
world won't defend themselves, 
we'll have to defend them. As 
long as I've been here, no party 
of snakes has come past this 
point of the valley. A few of them 
have tried!" His eyes glittered 
with open hatred. "But I can't 
be on guard here forever. It's up 
to you and the other men on the 
ship to do the job right!" 

rpHOUGH Boyce was sleeping 
uneasily, Marder hadn't yet 
shut his eyes. The uneasiness was 
in him, too; and in him it was 
strong enough to offset the fatigue and excitement of the day. 
Vague night sounds came into 
the room they shared, a plaintive, 
thin calling like the distant cry 
of a bird. Not too different from 
the sounds on many other worlds 
he had known, and, as on all 
worlds that were new and strange, 
faintly tinged with the menace 
that was largely in the imagination. 

But it was Hulman himself who 
was the principal cause of Marder's uneasiness. 

The face of the old explorer, 
the rumbling, angry voice, his 
monomaniacal devotion to the 
strange humanoids kept recurring in his mind. Nothing Hulman had done previously to 
stimulate the imagination of 
Earthmen toward the laborious 
exploration of space could equal 



58 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



this final accidental achievement: 
to have encountered the first 
other human beings Earthmen 
had yet discovered in the Universe. Men had looked out from 
their world like children staring 
into a great, dark forbidding 
room. They had found space to be 
peopled sparsely with intelligent 
life — life that was sometimes horrible, sometimes merely odd, 
sometimes beautiful in weird, incomprehensible ways. But never 
enough like Man to be acceptable! 

Hulman's fierce insistence on 
protecting what seemed to be the 
dying remnants of a human race 
against its own wishes was 
something Marder could understand well enough. He did not 
doubt that Boyce and the others 
would respond wholeheartedly to 
that insistence. Here was the 
proof that human life could rise 
spontaneously and endlessly 
throughout all the galaxies, that 
the Universe was not a darkened 
room, after all, but one lighted 
forever by the fires of humanity. 

They had to protect that 
proof . . . 

Strangely enough, though 
Boyce was asleep and he awake, 
it was Boyce who first seemed 
aware of motion in the house. 
Marder heard him breathe and 
stir unquietly, and then come 
awake and grow still, listening, 
waiting. He smiled faintly at the 




familiar signs, the tense alertness, 
the silent questioning of the 
strange world about them : "What 
is it? Who moves?" On many 
other strange, dark worlds, he had 
been among Earthmen as they 
came awake, asking that question. And he with them . . . 

He grew aware of it then: there 
was motion in the house now, beyond the walls. Gradually, it resolved itself into slow, heavy 
steps on the carpeted flooring; 
and the picture of Hulman leaving his room to peer down the 
stairs came so convincingly into 
his mind that at once he relaxed 
again. And he was aware that 
Boyce was relaxing too. 

Neither of them spoke. After 
a time, Hulman went back to his 
room, walking carefully so as not 
to disturb his guests; and the 
house was still. Presently, Boyce 
was sleeping again. Marder tried 
to pick up the train of thoughts 
he had been following before the 
disturbance; but they eluded him 
now. Fatigue grew up in him like 
waves of mental darkness, smothering the remnants of uneasiness; 
and reluctantly he let himself 
drift off. 

The blast that roused him 
seemed to have gone off almost 
beside his head. 

TTE found himself standing in 
the center of the room, gun 
in one hand, flashbeam in the 



CARETAKER 



59 



other. Boyce's wide back was 
just disappearing through the 
door into the dark hall beyond; 
and Boyce's shout was in his 
ears: 

"Hulman! They've got Hulman!" 

Marder halted a fraction of a 
second, checked by the ridiculous 
hesitation of a man who doesn't 
want to go out into a strange 
house undressed; then he was following Boyce. As he plunged 
down the broad staircase to the 
lower floor of Hulman's house, a 
memory flashed into his mind: 
the guns that Hulman, cut off 
from standard power sources, had 
manufactured for himself here 
and shown them earlier in the 
evening. It had been the report 
of a missile gun that had awakened him; one of Hulman's own. 

He lost Boyce's light for a moment when he reached the lower 
floor, and stood in indecision until 
he heard a muffled shouting to 
his left, and remembered the descent into the cellars. As he reached the door, there was another 
angry shout from Boyce, and a 
blaze of pink light from below. 
Boyce had cut loose with his gun, 
so he was in contact with the intruders; and things would have 
to be finished very quickly now 
— a thermion spray was not designed to be an indoor weapon! 

Marder reached the bottom of 
the cellar stairs seconds later. 



A hedge of flame to their right, 
steady, impenetrable and soundless, slanted from the wall half 
around the great well. It cut them 
off from further advance; presumably it had cornered their 
antagonists. 

Boyce, dressed in nightshorts, 
turned a furiously contorted face 
to him. 

"One of them ducked around 
the corner over there! It can't get 
out. It was carrying Hulman!" 

"Where is Hulman?" 

"Over there — dead!" 

"jlATARDER squinted against the 
reflected glare of the fire. 
Something dark lay hunched 
against the wall beyond the well; 
that was all he could make out. 

"Sure he's dead?" His voice 
carefully matter-of-fact. 

"Of course!" Boyce said beside 
him. The hand that held the gun 
was shaking. "When it dropped 
him — when I snapped a bolt at it 
— I saw he'd been shot through 
the head with his own gun!" 

"The natives?" Marder asked, 
still carefully. 

"No. Something— those snakes 
he was afraid of — some animal. 
It whipped around the corner before I saw it very clearly — " 

His voice had gone dull. Marder glanced at him quickly. Boyce 
was in a state of semi-shock, and 
they had only a few minutes before the fire ate far enough into 



60 




 



the walls to threaten their retreat 
upstairs and out of the house. He 
had no personal qualms about 
leaving Hulman's body and Hulman's slayers to roast together — 
the coincidence of murder on that 
particular night was something 
one could flgure out more conveniently later — but Boyce might 
present a problem. 

A voice addressed them from 
out of a passage beyond the well. 

"You who were his friends," it 
said, "will you listen to me?" 

Marder felt his scalp crawling. 
"Who are you?" he called back. 

"He called me his wife." 

Boyce started violently, but 
Marder waved him to silence. It 
was a rich, feminine voice, a trifle 
plaintive; it was not difficult to 
fit it mentally to the painting of 
Hulman's wife. 

"Why did you kill him?" 

There was a pause. 

"But I thought you understood," the voice said. "Your 
medical men would say that he 
had been insane for twenty years, 
as he counted time. They would 
have forced him back into sanity. 
I could not bear the thought that 
he should suffer that." 

Marder swallowed hard. "Suffer what?" 

"Are you all fools? He was a 
fool, though I loved him. He 
could not see behind the shape of 
things. So — here among us — he 
saw shapes he could bear to see. 



In those moments when sanity 
came to him and he really saw 
what was there — then he killed. 
Are you all like that?" 

DOYCE stared at Marder, his 
" mouth working. "What is 
she talking about?" he whispered 
hoarsely. "Is the snake with her?" 

"Go upstairs, Boyce! Wait for 
me outside!" 

"Are you going to kill the 
snake?" 

"Yes. I'll kill the snake." 

Boyce disappeared up the stairs. 

"The house is burning, but 
there is some time left," Marder 
told the voice then. "Is there any 
way you can save yourself?" 

"I can leave by the river that 
flows under the well," the voice 
said, "if you do not shoot' at me." 

"I won't shoot at you." 

"May I take his body?" 

Marder hesitated. "Yes." 

"And you will all leave with 
your ship? I loved him, though 
my people thought it strange almost beyond their tolerance. 
They are foolish, too, yet not as 
foolish as you are. They saw what 
was in his mind and not beyond 
that, and so they were afraid of 
him. But he is dead now and 
there is nothing that your people 
and mine could share. We are 
too different. Will you leave?" 

Marder moistened his lips. 
"We'll leave," he said, seeing it 
all now, and glad he had sent

Boyce upstairs. "What did you 
see beyond what was in his 
mind?" 

"A brave spirit, though very 
frightened," the voice said slowly. "He ventured far and far and 
far into the dark of which he was 
afraid. I loved him for that!" It 
paused. "I am coming now," it 
added, "and I think you had better look away." 

Marder did not intend to look 
away, but at the last moment, 
when there was movement at the 
corner of the passage, he did. He 
saw only a swift undulating 
shadow pass along the wall, pause 
and stoop quickly, rise again with 
a bulky burden clasped to it, 
glide on and vanish. 

He stood staring at the blank 
wall until there was a faint splash 
in the well far below him. 

^TlHE great ship was drifting 
slowly above the night side of 
the world it was leaving, when 
Commander Lowndes joined 
Marder at the observation port. 

"Boyce will make out all 
right," he said moodily. "He only 
guessed part of the truth, and 
that bit is being taken from his 
mind." He studied Marder 
thoughtfully. "If you'd looked 
squarely at the thing, we might 
have had to give you the same 
treatment. Our pickled specimens 
are pretty damned hideous." 

Marder shrugged. Lowndes sat 



on the edge of a table. 

"Selective hysterical blindness 
maintained for twenty-two years 
— with his own type of artistic 
hallucinations thrown in! I can't 
help wishing it hadn't happe'ned 
to Hulman." 

"He didn't maintain it through- ■ 
out," Marder said slowly. "And 
whenever he saw them clearly, he 
killed them . . ." 

"Who wouldn't? I almost feel," 
Lowndes said, "like getting out of 
space and staying out, for good!" 

Which was giving it the ultimate in emphasis. 

"What are you reporting?" 
Marder asked. 

"That Hulman died here, quite 
peacefully, about a year before 
we found him — leaving a diary of 
inspiring courage and devotion to 
space exploration behind him. 
We'll have time enough to work 
up the diary. That should keep 
everybody happy. Marder," he 
said suddenly, waving his hand 
at the observation port, "do you 
think there actually are — well, 
people out there. Somewhere?" 

Marder looked out at the vast, 
star-studded, shining black immensity. 

"I hope so," he said. 

"Do you think we'll ever find 
them?" 

"I don't know," Marder said 
thoughtfully. "They've never 
found us."

Home is the Hunter 



Incentives change constantly, 



but one thing never does— the 



idea that they are permanent! 



By C. I. MOORE 



THERE'S nobody I can 
talk to except myself. I 
stand here at the head of 
the great waterfall of marble steps 
dropping into the reception hall 
■ below, and all my wives in all 
their jewels are waiting, for this 
is a Hunter's Triumph — my Triumph, Honest Roger Bellamy, 
Hunter. The light glitters on the 
glass cases down there with the 
hundreds of dried heads that I 
have taken in fair combat, and 
I'm one of the most powerful men 
in New York. 



HENRY KUTTNER 



The heads make me powerful. 

But there's nobody I can talk 
to. Except myself? Inside me, listening, is there another Honest 
Roger Bellamy? I don't know. 
Maybe he's the only real part of 
me. I go along the best I can, 
and it doesn't do any good. Maybe the Bellamy inside of me 
doesn't like what I do. But I have 
to do it. I can't stop, for I was 
born a Hunter. It's a great heritage to be born to. Who doesn't 
envy me? Who wouldn't change 
with me, if they could?

HOME IS THE HUNTER 



63 



But knowing that doesn't help 
at all. 

I'm no good. 

Listen to me, Bellamy, listen to 
me, if you're there at all, deep 
inside my head. You've got to 
listen — you've got to understand. 
You, there, inside the skull. You 
can turn up in a glass case in 
some other Hunter's reception 
hall any day now, any day, with 
the crowds of Populi outside 
pressing against the view-windows and the guests coming in to 
see and envy, and all the wives 
standing by in satin and jewels. 

Maybe you don't understand, 
Bellamy. You should feel fine 
now. It must be that you don't 
know this real world I have to go 
on living in. A hundred years ago, 
or a thousand, it might have been 
different. But this is the Twentyfirst Century. It's today, it's now, 
and there's no turning back. 

I don't think you understand. 

YOU see, there isn't any choice. 
Either you end up in another 
Hunter's glass case, along with 
your whole collection of heads, 
while your wives and children 
are turned out to be Populi, or 
else you die naturally (suicide is 
one way) and your eldest son 
inherits your collection, and you 
become immortal, in a plastic 
monument. You stand forever in 
transparent plastic on a pedestal 
along the edge of Central Park, 



like Renway and old Falconer 
and Brennan and all the others. 
Everyone remembers and admires and envies you. 

Will you keep on thinking then, 
Bellamy, inside the plastic? Will 
I? 

Falconer was a great Hunter. 
He never slowed down, and he 
lived to be fifty-two. For a 
Hunter, that is a great old age. 
There are stories that he killed 
himself. I don't know. The wonder is that he kept his head on 
his shoulders for fifty-two years. 
The competition is growing harder, and there are more and more 
younger men these days. 

Listen to me, Bellamy, the Bellamy within. Have you ever really 
understood? Do you still think 
this is the wonderful young time, 
the boyhood time, when life is 
easy? Were you ever with me in 
the long, merciless years while my 
body and mind learned to be a 
Hunter? I'm still young and 
strong. My training has never 
stopped. But the early years were 
the hardest. 

Before then, there was the wonderful time. It lasted for six years 
only, six years of happiness and 
warmth and love with my mother 
in the harem, and the fostermothers and the other children. 
My father was very kind then. 
But when I was six, it stopped. 
They shouldn't have taught us 
love at all, if it had to end so 



64 




 



soon. Is it that you remember, 
Bellamy within? If it is, it can 
never come back. You know that. 
Surely you know it. 

The roots of the training were 
obedience and discipline. My 
father was not kind any more. 
I did not see my mother often 
and, when I did, she was changed, 
too. Still, there was praise. There 
were the parades when, the Populi cheered me and my father. He 
and the trainers praised me when 
I showed I had special skill in 
the duel, or in marksmanship, or 
judo-stalking. 

It was forbidden, but my 
brothers and I sometimes tried 
to kill each other. The trainers 
watched us carefully. I was not 
the heir, then. But I became the 
heir when my elder brother's neck 
was broken in a judo- fall. It 
seemed an accident, but of course 
it wasn't, and then J had to be 
more careful than ever. I had to 
become very skillful. 

All that time, all that painful 
time, learning to kill. It was natural. They kept telling us how natural it was. We had to learn. And 
there could be only one heir . . . 

We lived under a cloud of fear 
even then. If my father's head 
h ad been taken, we would all 
have been turned out of the mansion. Oh, we wouldn't have gone 
hungry or unsheltered. Not in this 
age of science. But not to be a 
Hunter! Not to become immortal, 



in a plastic monument standing 
by Central Park! 

SOMETIMES I dream that I 
am one of the Populi. It seems 
strange, but in the dream I am 
hungry. And that is impossible. 
The great power plants supply 
all that the world needs. Machines synthesize food and build 
houses and give us all the necessities of life. I could never be one 
of the Populi, but if I were, I 
would go into a restaurant and 
take whatever food I wished out 
of the little glass-fronted compartments. I would eat well — far 
better than I eat now, as a matter 
of fact. And yet, in my dream, I 
am hungry. 

Perhaps the food I eat does not 
satisfy you, Bellamy within me. 
It does not satisfy me, but it is 
not meant to. It is nutritious. Its 
taste is unpleasant, but all the 
necessary proteins and minerals 
and vitamins are in it to keep 
my brain and body at their highest pitch. And it should not be 
pleasant. It is not pleasure that 
leads a man to immortality in 
plastic. Pleasure is a weakening 
and an evil thing. 

Bellamy within — do you hate 
me? 

My life has not been easy. It 
isn't easy now. The stubborn flesh 
fights against the immortal future, urging a man to be weak. 
But if you are weak, how long 



HOME IS THE HUNTER 



65 




 



can you hope to keep your head 
on your shoulders? 

The Populi sleep with their 
wives. I have never even kissed 
any of mine. (Is it you who have 
sent me those dreams?) My children? Yes, they are mine; artificial insemination is the answer. I 
sleep on a hard bed. Sometimes I 
wear a hair shirt. I drink only 
* water. My food is tasteless. With 
my trainers I exercise every day, 
until I am very tired. The life is 
hard — but in the end we shall 
stand forever in a plastic monument, you and I, while the world 
envies and admires. I shall die a 
Hunter and I shall be immortal. 

The proof is in the glass cases 
down there in my reception hall. 
The heads, the heads — look, Bellamy, so many heads! Stratton, 
my first. I killed him in Central 
Park with a machete. This is the 
scar on my temple that he gave 
me that night. I learned to be 
more deft. I had to. 

Each time I went into Central 
Park, fear and hate helped me. 
Often it is dreadful in the Park. 
We go there only at night, and 
sometimes we stalk for many 
nights before we take a head. The 
Park is forbidden, you know, to 
all but Hunters. 

It is our hunting ground. 

I have been shrewd and cunning and resourceful. I have 
shown great courage. I have stopped my fears and nursed my 



hate, there in the Park's shadows, 
listening, waiting, stalking, never 
knowing when I might feel sharp 
steel burning through my throat. 
There are no rules in the Park. 
Guns or clubs or knives — once I 
was caught in a man-trap, all 
steel and cables and sharp teeth. 
But I had moved in time, and 
fast enough, so I kept my right 
hand free and shot Miller between the eyes when he came to 
take me. There is Miller's head 
down in that case. You would 
never know a bullet had gone 
through his forehead, for the 
thanologists are clever. But usually we try not to spoil the heads. 

WHAT is it that troubles you 
so, Bellamy within? I am 
one of the greatest Hunters in 
New York. But a man must be 
cunning. He must lay traps and 
snares a long way in advance, 
and not only in Central Park. 
He must keep his spies active and 
his lines of contact taut in every 
mansion in the city. He must 
know who is powerful and who is 
not worth taking. What good 
would it do to win against a 
Hunter with only a dozen heads 
in his hall, while risking your own 
collection and your own head? 

I have hundreds. Until yesterday, I stood ahead of every man 
in my age-group. Until yesterday, I was the envy of all I knew, 
the idol of the Populi, the ac

knowledged master of half New. 
York. Half New York! Do you 
know how much that meant to 
me? That my rivals loathed me 
and acknowledged me their better? 

You do know, Bellamy. It was 
the breath of life that True Jonathan Hull and Good Ben Griswold ground their teeth when 
they thought of me, and that 
Black Bill Lindman and Whistler 
Cowles counted their trophies 
and then called me on the TV 
phone and begged me with tears 
of hate and fury in their eyes to 
meet them in the Park and give 
them the chance they craved. 

I laughed at them. I laughed 
Black Bill Lindman into a berserker rage and then almost envied him, because I have not been 
berserker myself for a long while 
now. I like that wild unloosening 
of all my awareness but one — the 
killing instinct, blind and without 
reason. I could forget even you 
then, Bellamy within. 

But that was yesterday. 

And yesterday night, Good Ben 
Griswold took a head. Do you 
remember how we felt when we 
learned of it, you and I? First I 
wanted to die, Bellamy. Then I 
hated Ben as I have never hated 
anyone before, and I have known 
much hate. I would not believe he 
had done it. I would not believe 
which head he took. 

I said it was a mistake, that he 



took a head from the Populi. But 
I knew I lied. No one takes a 
common head. They have no 
value. Then I said to myself, "It 
can't be the head of True Jonathan Hull. It can't be. It must not 
be!" For Hull was powerful. His 
hall held almost as many heads 
as mine. If Griswold were to have 
them all, he would be far more 
powerful than I. 

The thought was a torment I 
could not endure. 

I put on my Status Cap, with 
one bell on it for each head I 
have taken, and I went out to 
see. It was true, Bellamy. 

The mansion of Jonathan Hull 
was being emptied. The mob was 
surging in and out, while Hull's 
wives and children were leaving 
in little, quiet groups. The wives 
did not seem unhappy, but the 
boys did. (The girls had been 
sent to the Populi at birth, naturally ; they are worthless.) I 
watched the boys for a while. 
They were all wretched and angry. One was nearly sixteen, a big, 
agile lad who must have nearly 
finished his training. Someday I 
might meet him in the Park. 

The other boys were all too 
young. Now that their training 
had be*en interrupted, they would 
never dare enter the Park. That, 
of course, is why none of the 
Populi ever become Hunters. It 
takes long years of arduous training to turn a child from a rabbit

• to a tiger. In Central Park, only 
the tigers survive. 

1 LOOKED through True Jonathan's view- windows. I saw 
that the glass cases in his reception hall were empty. 

"So it is not a nightmare or a 
lie— Griswold does have them," 
I thought, "and True Jonathan's, 
besides." 

I went into a doorway and 
clenched my fists and beat them 
against the brownstone and 
groaned with self-contempt. 

I was no good at all. I hated 
myself, and I hated Griswold, 
too. Presently it was only that 
second hate that remained, so I 
knew what I had to do. 

"Today," I thought, "he stands 
where I stood yesterday. Desperate men will be talking to him, 
begging him, challenging him, 
trying every means they know to 
get him into the Park tonight. 
But I am crafty. I make my 
plans far ahead. I have networks 
that stretch into the mansions of 
every Hunter in the city, crossing their own webs." 

One of my wives, Nelda, was 
the key here. Long ago I realized 
that she was beginning to dislike 
me. I never knew why, but I fostered that dislike until it became 
hate. I saw to it that Griswold 
would learn the story. It is by 
strategems like this that I became as powerful as I was then — 



and will be again, will surely be 
again. 

I put on a glove, with hair and 
knuckle-lines and nails painted 
on to look like a hand, and I 
went to my TV phone and called 
Good Ben Griswold. He came 
grinning to the screen. 

"I challenge you, Ben," I said. 
"Tonight at nine, in the Park, by 
the carousel site." 

He laughed at me. He was a 
tall, heavily muscled man with a 
thick neck. 

I looked at his throat. 

"Tonight at nine," I repeated. 

He laughed again. "Oh, no, 
Roger," he said. "Why should I 
risk my head?" 

"You're a coward." 

"Certainly I'm a coward," he 
agreed, still grinning, "when 
there's nothing to gain and everything to lose. Was I a coward last 
night, when I took Hull's head? 
I've had my eye on him a long 
time, Roger. I'll admit I was 
afraid you'd get him first. Why 
didn't you, anyway?" 

"It's your head I'm after, Ben." 

"Not tonight," he said. ."Not 
for quite a while. I'm not going 
back to the Park for a long time; 
I'll be too busy. You're out of the 
running, anyhow, Roger. How 
many heads have you?" 

He knew, damn him, how far 
ahead of me he was — now. I let 
the hate show in my face. 

"The Park at nine tonight," I 



HOME IS, THE HUNTER 



yelled. "The carousel site. Or else 
I'll know you're afraid." 

"Eat your heart out, Roger," 
he mocked me. "Tonight I lead 
a parade. Watch me. Or don't — 
but you'll be thinking about me. 
You can't help that." 

"You swine! You rotten, cowardly swine!" 

HE laughed; he derided me, he 
goaded me, as I had done so 
many times to others. I did not 
have to pretend anger. I wanted 
to reach into the screen and sink 
my fingers in his throat. The furious rage was good to feel. It 
was very good. I let it build until 
it seemed high enough. I let him 
laugh and enjoy it. 

Then at last I did what I had 
been planning. At the right momerit, when it looked convincing, 
I let myself lose all control and 
I smashed my fist into the TV 
screen. It shattered. Griswold's 
face flew apart; I liked that. It 
was very satisfying. 

The connection was broken, of 
course. But 1 knew he would 
check quickly back. I slipped the 
protective glove from my right 
hand and called a servant I knew 
I could trust. (He is a criminal; 
I protect him. If I die, he will 
die and he knows it.) He bandaged my unharmed right hand 
and I told him what to say to 
the other servants. I knew the 
word would reach Nelda quick


ly, in the harem, and I knew that 
Griswold would hear within an 
hour. 

I fed my anger. All day, in the 
gymnasium, I practiced with my 
trainers, m achete and pistol in 
my left hand only. I made it 
seem that I was approaching the 
berserker stage, the killing madness that overcomes us when we 
feel we have completely failed. 

That kind of failure can have 
one of two results only. Suicide 
is the other. You risk nothing 
then, and you know your body 
will stand by the Park in its plastic monument. But sometimes the 
hate turns outward and there is 
no fear left. Then the Hunter is 
berserker, and while this makes 
him very dangerous, he is also 
good quarry then — he forgets his 
cunning. 

It was dangerous to me, too, 
for that kind of forgetfulness is 
very tempting, the next best thing 
to oblivion itself. 

Well, I had set the lure for 
Griswold. But it would take more 
than a lure to bring him out when 
he thought he had nothing to gain 
by such a risk. So I set rumors 
loose. They were very plausible 
rumors. I let it be whispered that 
Black Bill Lindman and Whistler 
Cowles, as desperate as I at Grisworld's triumph over us all, had 
challenged each other to a meeting in the Park that, night. Only 
one could come out alive, and 



70 




 



that one would be master of New 
York so far as our age-group 
counted power. (There was, of 
course, old Murdoch with his 
fabulous collection accumulated 
over a lifetime, but it was only 
among ourselves that the rivalry 
ran so high.) 

WITH that rumor abroad, I 
thought Griswold would 
act. There is no way to check 
such news. A man seldom announces openly that he is going 
into the Park. It could even be 
the truth, for all I knew. And for 
all Griswold knew, his supremacy 
was in deadly peril before he had 
even enjoyed his Triumph. There 
would be danger, of course, if he 
went out to defend his victory. 
Lindman and Cowles are both 
good Hunters. But Griswold, if 
he did not suspect my trap, had 
a chance at one sure victory — 
myself, Honest Roger Bellamy, 
waiting in berserker fury at a 
known rendezvous and with a 
right hand useless for fighting. 
Did it seem too obvious? Ah, but 
you don't know Griswold. 

When it was dark, I put on 
my hunting clothes. They are 
bulletproof, black, close-fitting, 
but very easy with every motion. 
I blacked my face and hands. I 
took gun, knife and machete with 
me, the metal treated so that it 
would not catch or reflect the 
light. I like a machete especially 



— I have strong arms. I was careful not to use my bandaged hand 
at all, even when I thought no 
one watched me. And I remembered that I must seem on the 
verge of berserker rage, because 
I knew Griswold's spies would be 
reporting every motion I made. 

I went toward Central Park, 
the entrance nearest the carousel 
site. That far Griswold's men 
could track me, but no farther. 

At the gate I lingered for a moment — do you remember this, 
Bellamy within me? Do you remember the plastic monuments 
we passed on the edge of the 
Park? Falconer and Brennan and 
the others, forever immortal, 
standing proud and godlike in the 
clear, eternal blocks. All passion 
spent, all fighting done, their 
glory assured forever. Did you 
envy them, too, Bellamy? 

I remember how old Falconer's 
eyes seemed to look through me 
contemptuously. The number of 
heads he had taken is engraved 
on the base of his monument, and 
he was a very great man. 

"Wait," I thought. "I'll stand 
in plastic, too. I'll take more 
heads than even you. Falconer, 
and the day that I do, it will be 
the day I can lay this burden 
down ..." 

Just inside the gate, in the 
deep shadows, I slipped the bandage from my right hand. I drew 
my black knife and, close against 



HOME IS THE HUNTER 



the wall, I began to work my way 
rapidly toward the little gate 
which is nearest Griswold's mansion. I had, of course, no intention 
of going anywhere near the carousel site. Griswold would be in a 
hurry to get to me and out again, 
and he might not stop to think. 
Griswold was not a thinker. I 
gambled on his taking the closest 
route. 

I waited, feeling very solitary 
and liking the solitude. It was 
hard to stay angry. The trees 
whispered in the darkness. The 
moon was rising from the Atlantic beyond Long Island. I thought 
of it shining on the Sound and on 
the city. It would rise like this 
long after I was dead. It would 
glitter on the plastic of my monument and bathe my face with cold 
light long after you and I, Bellamy, are at peace, our long war 
with each other ended. 

rpHEN I heard Griswold coming. I tried to empty my mind 
of everything except killing. It 
was for this that my body and 
mind had been trained so painfully ever since I was six years 
old. I breathed deeply a few 
times. As always, the deep, 
shrinking fear tried to rise in me. 
fear, and something more. Something within me — is it you, Bellamy? — that says I do not really 
want to kill. 

Then Griswold came into sight, 



and the familiar, hungry hatred 
made everything all right again. 

I do not remember very much 
about the fight. It all seemed to 
happen within a single timeless 
interval, though I suppose it went 
on for quite a long while. It 
was a hard, fast, skillful fight. 
We both wore bulletproof clothing, but we were both wounded 
before we got close enough to try 
for each other's heads with steel. 
He favored a saber, which was 
longer than my machete. Still, it 
was an even battle. We had to 
fight fast, because the noise might 
draw other Hunters, if there were 
any in the Park tonight. 

But in the end I killed him. 

I took his head. The Moon was 
not yet clear of the high buildings 
on the other side of the Park and 
the night was young. 

I summoned a taxi. Within 
minutes, I was back in my mansion, with my trophy. Before I 
would let the surgeons treat me, 
I saw to it that the head was 
taken to the laboratory for a 
quick treatment, a very quick 
preparation. And I sent out orders for a midnight Triumph. 

While I lay on the table and 
the surgeons washed and dressed 
my wounds, the news was flashing through the city already. My 
servants were in Griswold's mansion, transferring his collections 
to my reception hall, setting up 
extra cases that would hold all

my trophies, all True Jonathan 
Hull's and all of Griswold's, too. 
I would be the most powerful 
man in New York, under such 
masters as old Murdoch and one 
or two more. All my age-group 
and the one above it would be 
wild with envy and hate. I 
thought of Lindman and Cowles 
and laughed with triumph. 

I thought it was triumph — 
then. 

T STAND now at the head of 
the staircase, looking down at 
the lights and the brilliance, the 
row upon row of trophies, my 
wives in all their jewels. Servants 
are moving to the great bronze 
doors to swing them ponderously 
open. What will be revealed? The 
throng of guests, the great Hunters coming to give homage to a 
greater Hunter? Or — suppose no 
one has come to my Triumph, 
after all? 

The bronze doors are beginning 
to open. And I'm afraid. The 
fear that never leaves a Hunter, 
except in his last and greatest 
Triumph, is with me now. Suppose, while I stalked Griswold 
tonight, some other Hunter ambushed even bigger game — what 
if, for example, someone has 
taken old Murdoch's head? Then 
someone else would be having a 
Triumph in New York tonight, a 
greater Triumph than mine! 

The fear is choking me. I've 



failed. Some other Hunter has 
beaten me. I'm no good . . . 

No. Listen. Listen to them 
shouting my name! Look, look at 
them pouring in through the 
opened doors, all the great Hunters and their jewel -flashing women, thronging in to fill the 
bright hall beneath me. I feared 
too soon. I was the only Hunter 
in the Park tonight, after all. So 
I have won, and this is my Triumph. 

There's Lindman. There's 
Cowles. I can read their expressions very, very easily. They can't 
wait to get me alone tonight and 
challenge me to a duel in the 
Park. 

They all raise their arms toward me in salute. They shout 
my name. 

I beckon to a servant. He hands 
me the filled glass that is ready. 
Now I look down at the Hunters 
of New York — I look down from 
the height of my Triumph — and 
I raise my glass to them. 

I drink. 

Hunters, you cannot rob me

SECOND TRIP 
TO VENUS 



FOR some time now, I have 
been accumulating letters 
that could not be answered briefly, but which asked questions that I believe to be 
general interest. 

The first of these letters came j 
from Donald Kingsbury of 2108 
Maplewood Avenue, Montreal, 




74 




 



Canada, who offers this problem. 

Let's assume that space travel 
engineering has progressed to the 
point where we can send an expedition to Venus along the orbit 
of minimum fuel expenditure, a 
so-called Hohmann A orbit. Supposing that this is the best we 
can do, for we cannot yet use a 
more expensive orbit, the problem is this: 

How soon can a second expedition follow the first? 

A LL right, let us 'see first how 
such a trip would be made. 
The Earth moves around the Sun 
with a velocity of 18.5 miles per 
second. This is exactly enough to 
counteract the Sun's gravitational force at the distance of 93 
million miles. If a spaceship took 
off from the "forward" side of 
the Earth — which means at 
dawn — it would add its own 
velocity 'to that of the Earth and 
move "too fast" for the Sun to 
hold. As a result, the ship would 
drift outward in the Solar System, away from the Sun. But if 
the ship took off from the "back" 
of the Earth, at dusk, it would 
subtract its own velocity from 
the orbital velocity of the Earth 
and be "too slow" to maintain its 
position. It would drift inward 
in the Solar System. 

Don't be confused by the idea 
of taking off in the opposite direction of Earth's orbital move


ment. The ship would still move 
around the Sun in the same direction, because the ship's velocity would be on the order of 8 
or 9 miles per second, so it would 
still move in the same direction 
as the Earth, only more slowly. 
Seen from the Sun, it would 
make about 10 miles per second 
instead of 18.5. 

Drifting inward in the Solar 
System, the ship would approach 
the orbit of Venus. Now it can 
be shown conclusively that the 
minimum of fuel would be required if the ship's orbit just 
touched that of Venus. If you 
spent more fuel, it would cross 
the orbit and then you'd need 
more fuel to correct this. If you 
wanted to spend still less, the 
ship would not quite reach its 
destination. 

To travel from Earth to Venus 
along this most economical orbit 
would take 146 days. (See Diagram). In the course of these 146 
days, the ship would traverse, an 
angle of 180° as seen from the 
Sun. In other words, Earth at the 
moment of departure, the Sun, 
and Venus at the moment of arrival, must form a straight line. 

T>UT where must Venus be at 
departure time so that it will 
be in that straight-line position 
146 days later? Venus, moving 
with an orbital velocity of 21.7 
miles per second, needs 224 days

to go around the Sun once. This 
means that Venus moves 360°/224 d = 1.607 degrees per day. 
Earth moves 360°/365 d — 0.987 
degrees per day. So while the 
ship describes an arc of 180° during the 146 days of the trip's 
duration, Earth describes an arc 
of 146 times 0.987° = 144° and 
Venus 146 times 1.607° = 234.5°. 
Venus, during that time interval, 
moves 234.5 - 180 = 55.5° more 
than the ship. Therefore the planet could be reached only if at the 
instant of departure Venus (Vi) 
is 55^4 degrees behind Earth 
(E^. At the instant of arrival 
when Venus (V 2 ) is in the right 



position, the more sedately moving Earth (E 2 ) is 36° behind 
Venus. 

Supposing the ship somehow 
missed Venus, it would then drift 
back (dotted line in diagram) to 
the orbit of Earth, needing another 146 days for the trip back. 
It would arrive, after 292 days, 
where the Earth was 292 days 
ago — but unfortunately Earth 
needs 365 days (let's forget about 
those extra six hours) to get to 
the same spot so that it would 
still be 72° away (E 3 ). To arrive at Earth from Venus, Earth 
should not be 36° behind Venus, 
but 36° ahead of Venus. 

Since Venus is faster than 



76 




 



Earth, the only thing one can do 
is to wait until Venus has caught 
up from behind. Venus is 36° 
ahead at arrival, but we want 
Venus to catch up so that it is 
36° behind Earth. In other 
words, we want Venus to gain 
360° - 72° = 288°. Per day, 
Venus gains 1.607° - 0.987° = 
0.62° or a little better than half 
a degree. To gain 288° consequently takes 288/0.62 = 464 
days, which is the waiting period 
until the expedition can return, 
reaching Earth after 146 -\~ 464 
-f- 146 days. 

The figures for a trip to Mars 
work out as 258 + 455 + 258 
days. Although the trip to Mars 
would take .longer in itself, the 
waiting period happens to be a 
little shorter. 

But how soon could a second 
expedition follow the first? 

Well, obviously, the next time 
Venus is behind Earth by 55.5°, 
which simply means that, from 
one takeoff position to the next, 
we want Venus to gain a full 
circle or 360°. Which is 360/0.62 
= 581 days or a year and seven 
months. 

The second expedition, then, 
would reach its goal almost precisely two years after the departure of the first. 

T IKE everything unknown or 
supposed to be unknown, 
cosmic rays continue to excite 



the imagination, and in my mail 
they run a close second to "flying 
saucers." Indeed, sometimes they 
seem to catch up with the saucers, which, considering the reported velocities involved, would 
be only natural. The letter that 
prompts me to write about cosmic rays at this time came from 
a lady (Joan Ellen Coan, 30 East 
30th Street, N. Y. C), who had 
been informed by somebody she 
politely fails to identify that "a 
person living near the equator is 
safer from the mysterious cosmic 
rays than a person in the arctic 
because he has more air over his 
head to protect him." The informant also .added — I knew 
this was coming — that it would 
be impossible to protect a space 
crew against cosmic rays. 

This takes some careful dissecting to straighten out, because 
the statement as quoted is a fine 
mixture of fancy with some fact 
hidden inside. 

To begin with, there is little 
mystery about the nature of the 
cosmic rays. They are simply 
atomic nuclei traveling at high 
velocities. Most of them are the 
nuclei of light atoms, but there 
are occasional heavie3. 

What is "mysterious" is the 
source. 

The very best available evidence indicates that the cosmic 
ray intensity does not vary with 
either the time of the day or with 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



77 



the season. Day in and day out, 
all year round, you get very 
closely the same number. It does 
vary with the latitude because 
of the Earth's magnetic field. At 
the magnetic equator, the number is smallest; at the magnetic 
poles, it is highest, about ten 
times as large near the magnetic 
poles as near the magnetic equator. 

What happens is that the magnetic lines of force deflect the 
incoming particles. It is just because of this deflection that we 
don't know where they originate, 
for the direction of travel near 
the ground where we catch them 
has absolutely nothing to do with 
the direction of their travel in 
space before they approached the 
Earth. Although we don't have 
enough material as yet to be 
sure, this deflection seems to take 
place at such heights that the 
100-mile altitude of research 
rockets makes no difference. 

The same force that obscures 
the origin of the cosmic rays is 
also responsible for their distribution. Over the magnetic poles, 
an incoming cosmic ray is virtually unopposed; over the magnetic equator, there is maximum 
deflection. You might say that 
the rays are admitted at the 
magnetic poles while those which 
appear elsewhere managed to 
climb the fence, said fence-climbing growing more difficult with 



distance from the magnetic poles. 

So this takes care of nature, 
origin and distribution. 

TVTEXT we come to the problem 

' of protection. It is generally 
assumed, and correctly so, that 
incredibly heavy armor or steel, 
lead or concrete would be needed 
to stop cosmic rays. From this 
fact, it is usually reasoned that 
one will have to find a satisfactory compromise between the 
weight of armor that can be carried and the amount of protection afforded by that armor. This 
reasoning, however, is fallacious. 
It isn't as simple as saying that 
3-inch armor will stop 3-inch 
shells so that you have to worry 
only about heavier artillery. 

When a cosmic ray hits matter 
— say, our atmosphere — it produces so-called secondary rays 
which are hardly better than the 
original rays or "primaries." So 
after having produced the "secondaries," "tertiaries," etc., etc., 
you still need enough mass behind or below to stop all of them. 

Thin armor, then, instead of 
affording "some" protection, only 
serves as a source for secondaries 
without stopping the primaries. 

Under these circumstances, it 
is easy to see why scientists who 
have investigated these problems 
have declared bluntly that "a little protection is far worse than 
none at all." It is like seeking 



78 




 



protection against revolver bullets behind several thicknesses of 
window pane. All you accomplish is to get the bullets and 
glass splinters. 

Rocket engineers, naturally, 
are pleased by this. They much 
prefer to have a cabin wall as 
thin and as light as possible, just 
good enough to stay reliabl y 
pressurized. Now it turns out that 
this is best with regard to cosmic 
rays, too. 

But granting that "partial protection" is worse than none at 
all, can we do without protection? 

The answer is a clear yes. 

We now know the cosmic ray 
intensity that will be encountered in space. We know how much 
exposure is permissible for an 
individual and the top authority 
in the field, Dr. Hermann J. 
Muller, has declared that an exposure time of 5 or 6 years would 
still be safe. The term "safety" 
refers, of course, to offspring that 
may be conceived after the exposure. But when it comes to 
people who do not intend to have 
additional children, the term 
"safe" must be used with reference to direct bodily harm. 

And that stretches the exposure time very considerably. 
Quite likely, it is going to give 
a man far more years in space 
than he will care to spend out 
there. 



A S with all other items in this 
month's column, this is also 
in response to a letter. A reader 
in Cleveland who does not wish 
to see his name -in print wrote 
me a fairly long letter in which, 
after innumerable protestations 
of his devotion to astronomical 
knowledge, he finally got around 
to two points. One was a request 
to tell everything that is known 
about Jupiter's Red Spot. The 
other asked whether the Red Spot 
might be connected with the 
"flying saucers." 

As for the question, the answer 
is no. I am unable to see any 
connection between a phenomenon in Jupiter's atmosphere and 
a set of phenomena of a different 
type in our own atmosphere, 

But I'll be happy to oblige 
with the information requested. 

Jupiter's Red Spot is precisely 
what the name indicates — a 
large red spot which can be seen 
in a good telescope and which 
shows quite conspicuously on 
photographs. It is south of Jupiter's equator — in astronomical 
telescopes and photographs, 
where the image is reversed, it 
shows above the equator — and 
is elliptical in shape. In location, 
it corresponds to Madagascar on 
Earth, 20° southern latitude, but 
in size it corresponds to 3J/£ times 
the area of the Pacific Ocean, for 
the Red Spot extends for about 
30,000 miles east to west, and be


FOR YOUR INFORMATIO 



79 



tween 7,000 and 8,000 miles north 
to south. In color, the Red Spot 
was a decided brick red when 
strongest, but in the course of 
time it has been pinkish and even 
simply gray — one observer told 
me several decades ago that he 
had seen it as magenta when he 
was a young man. 

In many books you can find 
the statement that the Red Spot 
was discovered in 1878. That is 
not quite correct. It merely became prominent and conspicuous 
in that year. But there is an unbroken series of observations for 
twenty years prior to that date, 
beginning with one in 1857. A 
historically minded astronomer, 
W. F. Denning, spent much time 
going through older astronomical 
records and found it on a drawing made by Schwabe on the 5th 
of September 1831. In fact, it is 
possible that the first detail ever 
seen on Jupiter's surface, a dark 
spot on Jupiter's southern hemisphere, discovered by Robert 
Hooke in 1664, was what we now 
call the Red Spot. 

We know from our own experience since 1878 that the spot 
does not have to be red and that 
it can fade out. The latter might 
explain the lack of mention between 1664 and the 19th Century. 

JUPITER , as you probably 
know, rotates astonishingly 
fast for a planet of its size, doing 



so in a little less than ten hours. 
Consequently, Jupiter's disk is 
visibly flattened and streaked 
with cloud banks, indicating the 
presence of strong "trade winds." 
But since we cannot see Jupiter's 
surface, and since the clouds 
move with relation to the planet, 
you find a different rotational 
velocity if you look at different 
latitudes. 

Near the north pole, you find 
9 hours, 55 min. and 42 sec. Near 
the south pole, it is 9 hours, 55 
min., 24 sec. 

The southern "temperate current" moves within 9 hours, 55 
min. and 5 sec, while its northern 
equivalent needs 9 hours, 55 min., 
38 sec. 

The equatorial belt takes 9 
hours, 50 minutes and 30 sec, 
the red spot itself 9 hours, 55 
min., and 38 seconds. Since it is 
largely in an area that requires 
9 hours, 55 min. and 23 seconds, 
it moves slowly with respect to 
the neighboring cloud bands. 

The fact that the rotational 
period of the spot was different 
from the period of the atmosphere surrounding it was eagerly 
seized upon for an explanation. 
Naturally, the explanations were 
made up against the background 
of the astronomical beliefs of the 
time, some sixty years ago. 

Most astronomers were convinced then that Jupiter was still 
hot, possibly semi -molten, and 



80 




 



it was often thought that the four 
large moons of Jupiter might 
have a nice, pleasant climate. 
Even though they could not get 
much heat from the distant Sun, 
Jupiter itself probably made up 
for that. 

Another belief that was still 
around then was the Kant-Laplace hypothesis of the formation of planets and moons. It 
said, in short, that a rapidly rotating Sun will throw off its 
equatorial bulge as a ring, which 
then condenses into a planet, and 
that a rapidly spinning planet 
makes its moons in the same 
manner. 

T¥ERE we had a massive planet, spinning exceptionally 
fast. Moreover, a planet with 
many moons and a planet which 
was still hot. Wasn't it logical to 
assume that Jupiter was giving 
birth to another moon? At any 
rate, a number of astronomers 
accepted this idea and thev p r oSably expected to see the Red 
Spot separating itself from tne 
ball of the planet to take up a 
semi-i ndependent existence as 
another of Jupiter's moons. 

When that did not happen, the 
explanation was turned around. 
The difference in rotational motion might indicate that the Red 
Soot revealed the true motion 
of Jupiter's surface, hence the 
spot we saw was not the "event" 



itself, but merely a reflection of 
something that had taken place 
down below. 

Since the crust covering the 
fiery mass of the planet was 
probably very thin, it was easy 
to assume that a break had occurred which flooded an area of 
continental dimensions with lava. 
The cause for the break might 
have been purely local, a "geological" event, or else the break 
might have been caused by the 
crash of a minor planet or an 
unknown moon of Jupiter. 

At least the second explanation had the advantage that it 
could be clearly visualized and 
understood. Unfortunately, as 
we knoV now, it cannot be true. 
Not that we consider a crash of 
a minor planetoid into Jupiter 
unlikely — that has probably 
happened quite often — but our 
ideas about Jupiter itself have 
changed greatly. 

Being, in round figures, 86,600 
miles in diameter, Jupiter occupies 1350 times as much volume 
as the Earth. But its weight is 
only 318 times as great. So there 
cannot be an atmosphere some 
300 or 400 miles deep with a justcrusted-over lava core at the bottom of it. The planet simply does 
not weigh enough for that. 

The present concept of Jupiter, 
for this and other reasons, is 
that its atmosphere, consisting 
mostly of hydrogen with some 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



methane and ammonia, is 30,000 
miles deep, obviously with enormous pressures in its lower layers. Then follows what is called 
the Ice Mantle, some 10,000 miles 
thick, consisting of various 
"ices," frozen water, frozen ammonia, frozen methane. And only 
inside this ice mantle is there a 
rather small rocky and metallic 
core. 

The Red Spot, then, must be 
an atmospheric phenomenon, located in the upper layers. We 
don't know what it is, because 
chemistry and meteorology for 
an atmosphere like Jupiter's are 
sciences which don't yet exist.

ANY QUESTIONS^ 

What caused Gabriel Daniel 
Fahrenheit to place "zero" arbitrarily 32 degrees below freezing? 
There are 180 degrees between 
freezing and boiling by his scale. 
Does this have anything to do 
with the number of degrees in a 
semi-circle? How does F. compare with Celsius and centigrade? 

Battell Loomis 

201, 19rh Srreer 

Manhattan Beach, Calif. 
Yes, Herr Fahrenheit of Danzig did act in an arbitrary manner when he placed his "zero" 
32 degrees below the freezing 
point of water. But he had 
some justification for picking 
this particular temperature it 



was the coldest he could produce (by mixing snow and salt) 
on a cold winter's day. 

The range of 180° F. between 
freezing and boiling has no reference to the 180 degrees of 
arc in a half-circle; this is probarc in a half-circle; this is 
probably accidental. The upper 
fixed point was not the boiling 
point of water, originally. Fahrenheit thought that the temperature of the blood of an adult 
would be best, for it was then 
believed that this was a constant, provided the man was 
healthy. According to some historians of science, he took the 
blood temperature to be 96°, 
while others say that 100° was 
intended. Both values miscarried, as we well know, for a 
man with a blood temperature 
of 100 is decidedly a "patient." 

Even though, in Europe, centigrade degrees are called Celsius degrees — translators often 
slip up on this — there is a difference. It was the Swedish astronomer Prof. Anders Celsius 
who was the first to propose 
that the temperature interval 
between freezing and boiling of 
uncontaminated water under 
sea level pressure be divided into 100 degrees. But he wanted 
to call the boiling point "zero" 
and the freezing point "100" 
(or minus 100). On the centigrade scale which is now in use, 
zero is the freezing point and 



82 




 



100 the boiling point of water. 

The Kelvin degrees — named 
after the British physicist William, Baron Kelvin — are the 
same as centigrade degrees, but 
counted from absolute zero 
(— 273.1 on the centigrade 
Bcale) to avoid having to fuss 
with minus degrees. 

Fifty years ago, the Englishspeaking countries used the 
scale of the German Fahrenheit, the French, the Italians, 
Spaniards and others that of 
the Swede Celsius, but the Germans and Russians still clung to 
that of the Frenchman Rene 
Antoine Ferchault de Reaumur. 
On that scale, now fortunately 
extinct, zero was the freezing 
point of water, but the boiling 
point was 1 80 degrees. 

A few months ago, I ran across 
the term googolplex which was 
described as 

io'» 10 

Is this same as 10 10 °? / know that 
a googol is usually written as a 
one followed by 100 zeros. 

Jay OJins 

17332 Sunburst St. 

Northridge, Calif. 
Your last sentence is correct. 
A googol (of which its author, 
Dr. Edward Kasner, says that 
"it is not even approximately 
a Russian author") is a one 
followed by a hundred zeroes, 
in mathematical notation 10 mo . 



A googolplex is de6 ned as a 
one followed by a googol zeroes,

or if you want to lessen the 
probability of typographical errors and misreading 

io(.» ,0 °) 

Of course your figure 

io(»"> 

is much larger than 10 1<M> since 

that is only 10 v, ° This number does not have a separate 
name, however. 

Is uranium the heaviest element naturally occurring on 
Earth? 

Jerry O'Neill 
Silver Springs, Md. 

From the way you use the 
term "heaviest element," it 
seems to me that you mean 
atomic weight rather than specific gravity. In either case, 
uranium is not the heaviest element naturally occurring on 
Earth — plutonium is. 

The heaviest uranium isotope has a weight of 238. Plutonium has a weight of 239. 

As for specific gravity or 
density, osmium is at the Cop of 
the list with a density of 22.5 
limes that of water. The density of uranium is 18.7. I don't 
know whether or not the density of plutonium has been ofcially released.

THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



85 



The expedition was in the Twilight Zone, naturally, at the time. 
Without special clothing, which 
no one had, both the perpetual 
night of the Cold Side and the 
furnace heat of the Hot Side 
were out of the question. The 
Twilight Zone at this point was 
about forty miles wide, and the 
Astrolight had been skillfully 
brought down smack in the middle of it. Two hours after the 
landing, having ascertained that 
the air was as breathable as 
Kalinoff had reported, McCracken went out and aimed his explosive bullet at the Mercurian. 

If it hadn't been for Carvalho, 
who accompanied him, the rest 
of the group would have known 
nothing of the incident. It was 
Carvalho who reported what had 
happened to Lamoureux, captain 
of the expedition. 

McCracken, of course, burst 
into vigorous denials that he had 
shot a native. "You don't think 
I'd be fool enough to go around 
looking for trouble, do you?" 

T AMOUREUX thought he 
" would, but didn't say so. 
"You did shoot at something. We 
heard the report." 

"I tried to hit a dangerous 
bird." 

"What sort of bird was it?" 

"Kind of like a penguin, I'd 
say, but with a broader face. No 
bill to speak of — " 



"Then don't speak of it," 
snapped Lamoureux. "Did you 
score a hit?" 

"I think the explosion caught 
it in the shoulder. It got away." 

"Thank God for small favors," 
said Lamoureux. "That bird, you 
pigeon -brain, was a Mercurian. 
How do you expect intelligent inhabitants of other planets to 
look? Like you? They'd die of 
mortification." 

"Damn it, how was I to know?" 

"I told you not to shoot unless you were attacked." Lamoureux scowled. "Kalinoff is somewhere in the Twilight Zone and 
we were supposed to find him 
with the help of the Mercurians. 
It may interest you to know that, 
while you were out at target practice, some of them came around 
here and began to behave as if 
they wanted to be friendly. Then 
they suddenly disappeared. I 
imagine they got news of what 
you had done. A fat lot of help 
they'll give us now." 

"We'll run across Kalinoff 
without them," said McCracken 
confidently. 

Carvalho, who had a habit of 
looking for the dark side of every 
situation, and finding it, suggested, "Suppose the Mercurians 
attack us?" 

McCracken said, "They haven't 
any weapons." 

"How do you know?" 
"Kalinoff didn't mention any." 




 



Lamoureux emitted a laugh 
that sounded like an angry bark. 
"Kalinoff wouldn't know. He was 
friendly with them. He did report 
that they were an intelligent race. 
It'll be too bad if they use their 
intelligence against us." 

McCracken thrust out his jaw. 
There was a streak of stubbornness in him, and he was not going 
to take too many dirty cracks 
lying down. He growled, "I think 
you're making a mountain out 
of an anthill." 

"Molehill," corrected Lamoureux. 

"Whatever it is. What if Kalinoff did say the Mercurians would 
help us? You can't take his word 
for it. Everybody knows what 
Kalinoff is." 

Lamoureux frowned. "Kalinoff 
is a great man and a great explorer." 

"They call him the interplanetary screwball." 

"Not on this expedition, they 
don't, McCracken. You will 
please keep a civil tongue in your 
head." 

"There's nothing wrong in what 
I'm saying. Kalinoff is a screwball, and you know it, Captain. 
He's always playing practical 
jokes. Look at how he got that 
Martian senator into the same 
cage with a moon-snake, and 
locked the door on him. The senator had a fit. How was he to 
know the shake was harmless?" 



"You don't think Kalinoff 
would play jokes when his own 
life was at stake, do you?" 

"Once a screwball," insisted 
McCracken firmly, "always a 
screwball." 

Lamoureux lost patience. "Once 
an idiot, always an idiot. Get over 
to the ship and help with the 
unpacking. And remember, if we 
don't find Kalinoff, it'll be your 
fault, and God help you." 

TTAVING, he hoped, left McCracken feeling properly 
ashamed of himself, Lamoureux 
walked away. The responsibility 
was beginning to weigh him down. 
The other nineteen men in the 
expedition thought they were 
merely trying to rescue an intrepid explorer for the sake of 
human life, which was supposed 
to be sacred. They didn't know 
that, behind his screwball surface, 
Kalinoff was as shrewd as they 
came. He had made some valuable discoveries — and promptly 
staked out a claim to them. 

He had run across large quantities of stable isotopes of metals 
whose atomic numbers ranged 
from 95 to 110. These had remarkable and useful properties. 

They were, to begin with, of 
unusual value as catalysts in 
chemical reactions. For example, 
element 99, in the presence of air, 
was a more powerful oxidizing 
agent than platinum or palladium

was a reducing agent, in the presence of hydrogen. And the oxidations could be controlled beautifully, could be made to affect 
almost any part of a complicated 
organic molecule at a time. Element 99 was recoverable, and 
could be used again and again. 
A few hundred grams of it alone 
might very well pay for the cost 
of the entire expedition. 

Add the value of a few kilos of 
elements 101 to 110, and Kalinoff 
had discovered enough to make 
him and a few other people rich 
for life. 

Lamoureux wanted to be one of 
those other people. He had three 
kids he wanted to send through 
Lunar Tech; he had a wife with 
expensive tastes in robot servants; 
and he had relatives. Let him get 
Kalinoff off this God-forsaken 
planet, where he had been marooned for the past year, and even 
an interplanetary screwball might 
be expected to show some feeling 
of gratitude. Combine this feeling 
of gratitude with a reasonably 
fair contract already printed, and 
needing only the explorer's scrawl 
to give it validity, and Lamoureux could almost feel the money 
in his pocket. If only McCracken 
had not spoiled everything by his 
stupidity — 

Lamoureux shuddered to think 
that by the time they got to him 
Kalinoff might be dead, and they 
would have to do business with 



his heirs — heirs who had no sense 
of gratitude to impair their business judgment. He felt suddenly 
poor again. But he put the 
gloomy thought out of his head, 
and went on with his work. 

UNPACKING would be finished in a couple of hours at 
most. Meanwhile there was some 
preliminary exploring to be done. 
The neighboring ground must be 
surveyed, and landmarks noted, 
so that they would have a suitable base from which to start 
their search. Kalinoff had talked 
about two mountains with a saddlelike ridge joining them. Those 
two mountains shouldn't be too 
difficult to recognize— if ever the 
expedition ran across them. 

McCracken, obeying orders, 
was lending a hand at the unloading. What with Mercury's low 
gravity, and his own strength, he 
had no difficulty in wrestling 
around the five hundred pound 
crates in which their supplies had 
been packed. However, he was of 
little help in getting the work 
done. With what Lamoureux decided was characteristic stupidity, 
he seemed to be mostly in everyone else's way. '* 

Lamoureux called, "McCracken!" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Let go those crates. The others 
will handle them. I want you — " 
Lamoureux stopped suddenly. 



88 




 



A distant sound had come to his 
ears — the explosion of a bullet. 

There was a sudden silence that 
was so absolute, Lamoureux could 
hear his men breathe. Another 
bullet exploded, then another — 
and silence again. 

Somebody whispered, "The natives don't have guns. It must be 
Kalinoff!" 

"What luck to find him this 
way!" 

Lamoureux had run for his 
own gun. He fired ten shots into 
the air and waited. But there was 
no reply. 

Lamoureux spat out his orders 
with machine-gun speed. "McCracken, v you, Carvalho, and 
Haggard set out to the right. The 
shots seemed to be coming from 
that direction. But we'll take no 
chances. Gronski, Terrill and 
Cannoni, go straight ahead. 
Marsden and Blaine, to the left; 
Robinson and Sprott, to the rear. 
Spread out fast and keep your 
eyes peeled. Don't go any further 
away than the sound of a bullet. 
Uncover every damned whitebush, and tear up every desertcat hill, but don't come back 
without Kalinoff. Now get going!" 

HpHE men started on a run. 

Lamoureux, waiting impatiently, walked up and down in 
growing excitement. He had come 
prepared for a three months' 
search, expected it. He had pic


tured himself and his men, exhausted by a long trek across 
the planet, coming upon the 
startled Kalinoff, striking a magnificent attitude, and saying, with 
characteristic Tellurian modesty, 
"Dr. Livingston, I presume." And, 
instead, he was going to find 
Kalinoff in less than a day. He 
ran into the ship, got out the 
printed contract, and read it hastily. 

All was in order. He'd have 
Kalinoff's signature that day. 

A half hour passed, and Lamoureux fired ten more shots. Haskell, the cook, was looking at the 
sky with a troubled expression 
on his face. He approached Lamoureux apologetically. "Say, Captain — " 

"What is it, Haskell?" 

"Does it ever rain on Mercury?" 

"Never. No rain, no snow, no 
hail. No man who has ever set 
foot on the planet has come 
across any sort of bad weather. 
Kalinoff emphasizes that fact." 

"Well, that's what I seemed to 
remember. But just now I 
thought I felt a drop of rain." 

"Impossible, Haskell. Some 
bird—" 

Lamoureux stopped abruptly. 
He, too, had thought he -felt a 
drop of rain. 

Haskell held out a hairy paw. 
"I thought I felt another one." 
His eyes fell on the brown rocks. 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



89 



"Say, here's a big drop that 
splashed." 

The brown rocks were being 
slowly spotted with black. And, 
as Lamoureux stared, he felt his 
head grow wet. There was no 
doubt about it. It was raining. 

His mouth dropped open. "But 
it doesn't rain on Mercury!" 

The sky was a dull gray now, 
and the patter of rain drowned 
out his words. He realized suddenly that he was becoming 
soaked. 

Haskell was running for the 
ship. Lamoureux followed him 
and slammed the door shut. The 
men who had not been sent to 
search for KalinofT were already 
inside. The rain rattled on the 
hull of the Astrolight, and on the 
parched ground. 

Lamoureux stared through the 
side port and repeated blankly, 
"But it doesn't rain on Mercury!" 

Fortunately, the noise of the 
rain was so loud that no one 
heard him say it. 

II 

TT was six hours before the first 
of the search 1 parties Lamoureux had sent out returned. The 
men were soaked, but they had 
seen no trace of Kalinoff. They 
had faithfully tried to follow 
Lamoureux's directions, but in a 
downpour where it was impossible to see more than fifty feet 



ahead of them, they stood little 
chance of rescuing anyone. Most 
of the six hours had been spent 
finding their own way home. 

The other search parties drifted in slowly, until all had returned. Lamoureux checked them off 
one by one, and discovered, with 
practically no surprise, that McCracken was missing. 

"Where is the idiot?" he growled. 

"McCracken separated from 
the rest of us," replied Carvalho. 
"He thought he could catch a 
glimpse of those mountains 
Kalinoff described." 

"When was this?" 

"Just before it started to rain." 

"He's probably within a few 
hundred yards of the ship right 
now, but can't find us because of 
this rain. I hope he has sense 
enough to dig up a white-bush 
and get some shelter." 

"We can never be sure how 
much sense McCracken has. Anyway, Captain, it can't go on raining like this for very long." 

But it could, and it did. The 
men sat around in the ship, 
stretching lazily, and took life 
easy. They had not had time to 
unpack many of the five hundred 
pound crates, and what materials 
were exposed to the rain would 
not be spoiled. There was no 
harm in leaving them where they 
were. 

A vacation of this sort would 



90 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



have been welcome, if the trip 
through space to Mercury had 
itself not been so largely a vacation. After a day, Lamoureux saw 
plainly that his men were sick 
of inactivity. So, for that matter, 
was he. He had come to take part 
in a strenuous and dangerous 
expedition, not to sit on his fanny 
waiting for the rain to go away. 

Twenty-four hours after everyone else had returned to the ship, 
McCracken made a sensational 
reappearance. With that independence of thought that Lamoureux 
was beginning to recognize, he had 
found his own way of coping with 
the bad weather. He had stripped off his soggy and unpleasant 
clothing, and had meandered 
around for the past day clad in 
nothing but his shorts, with his 
rifle, his one remaining possession, 
held firmly in the crook of his 
right arm. The rain was fairly 
warm, and outside of giving him 
his usual ravenous appetite, his 
outing had done him no harm. 

T AMOUREUX got one of the 
■"^ crew to dig up an extra suit 
of clothes to cover McCracken's 
manly beauty. "Where did you 
sleep?" 
"I didn't." 

"You wandered around all this 
time shocking the natives without 
rest?" 

"I'm no sissy , " grunted McCracken. "I'm not even tired." 



He yawned, and caught himself. "I didn't see anything of 
Kalinoff. But I got a good look 
at those mountains he described. 
The pair with the saddleback 
ridge between them." 

"Where are they?" 

McCracken scratched his head. 
"I think I lost my sense of direction. But they're not far from 
here. No, sir, they're not far. 
Kalinoff is as good as found. The 
screwball." 

His eyes closed while he was 
talking, and Lamoureux had him 
led to his bunk and deposited 
there. Two minutes later, McCracken's snoring was competing 
successfully with the noise of the 
rain. 

There was little sense in looking 
for the mountains until the rain 
let up. Lamoureux waited, and 
waited in vain. The downpour 
kept on until its monotonous 
sound had become an integral 
part of their life. They learned 
to talk without paying any attention to it, and without even hearing it. But not without, now and 
then, cursing it. 

After it had been raining for a 
week, Lamoureux noticed that 
the temperature was falling. It 
probably signified that on this 
part of the Twilight Zone the Sun 
was dropping further behind the 
horizon. As if he didn't already 
have troubles enough. He cursed 
Mercury; he cursed the Twilight 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



91 



Zone; he cursed the rain; he even 
cursed the Sun. A few hours later, he also cursed the snow and 
the hail. 

Such weather was absolutely 
incredible. There was nothing to 
explain it. As he had told Haskell, 
the cook, no previous explorer 
had ever seen a sign of rain, snow, 
or hail. Kalinoff had not reported 
such phenomena, and Kalinoff 
got around. 

The men were going crazy with 
inactivity. Worst of all, to Lamoureux, was the way they looked 
at him. They seemed to feel that, 
as leader of the expedition, he 
was responsible for the weather. 
Lamoureux almost found himself 
agreeing with them. 

|~kN the tenth day, he could 
^-^ stand it no longer. He called 
the men together and made a 
short speech. "Men, this rain 
seems able to go orT forever. We 
can't stay here waiting for it to 
clear up." 

Somebody cheered hopefully, 
and the others, for the sake of 
exercising their lungs, joined in. 

Lamoureux held up his hand. 
"McCracken has reported that he 
saw the mountains we were looking for, with the saddleback ridge 
between them. Rain or no rain, 
we're going to find them." 

Somebody yelled, "Three 
cheers for Big Muscles McCracken!" The three cheers were roar


ed. Then there came, "Three 
cheers for our brave and heroic 
captain!" and, "Three cheers for 
the mountains!" and even, "Three 
cheers for the lousy rain and 
snow." 

Lamoureux began to feel uncomfortable. This was too much 
like a high school football rally, 
with burlesque overtones, to suit 
him. The men were bursting with 
pent-up energy, and it had to get 
out somehow. 

"I'm leaving only a half dozen 
of you behind to stay with the 
ship. The rest are coming with 
me. Any volunteers?" 

He had expected what followed. They all volunteered. He 
made his choices rapidly. McCracken went along because he 
had actually seen the mountains. 
Carvalho would make an intelligent assistant. Gronski, Marsden, 
Sprott — he reeled off the names 
rapidly, and in less than a minute 
had his group, leaving a disgruntled half dozen who would 
have nothing to do but continue 
to sit around the ship. 

Lamoureux himself carried a 
two-way radio transmission set 
capable of receiving intelligible 
signals over a distance of 12,000 
miles. He gave another of the sets 
to McCracken, and ordered the 
man to hang on to it no matter 
what happened. In the rain, it 
would be their only way of maintaining communications with the 



92 




 



ship. He put McCracken and the 
radio in the second squad under 
Carvalho, and himself took charge 
of the first. The two squads 
would stick together unless some 
emergency demanded that they 
separate. 

When they set out in the snow, 
wearing the heaviest clothing they 
had, the men were singing. McCracken's voice, like the croaking 
of a huge bullfrog, supplied an 
unharmonized but ear-filling bass. 
It sounded so impressive to Lamoureux that not until McCracken 
had reached the third song did 
he perceive that the man didn't 
know any of the melodies at all. 
He just oom-pahed as the spirit 
moved him, evidently feeling that, 
on Mercury, noise and good spirits were more important than any 
tune. 

npHEY had been marching for 
a half hour when Gronski exclaimed, "Well, I'll be damned 
to Venus and back!" 

"What's wrong, Gronski?" 

"It isn't snowing so hard, Captain." 

It wasn't. Carvalho said hopefully, "Maybe it'll stop." 

Sprott was so overwhelmed 
with delight that he scooped up a 
huge pile of snow, pressed it together, and popped McCracken 
on the nose with it. McCracken 
threw him down and poured snow 
down his back. 



Lamoureux said angrily, "Stop 
that, you foolsl You're not a 
bunch of kids." 

The horseplay came to an 
abrupt halt. They marched on a 
little more soberly, and in a few 
minutes the snow had stopped 
falling altogether. Instead of being as happy as Lamoureux had 
expected, McCracken seemed 
puzzled. He scratched his head 
and scowled. 

"What's wrong, McCracken? 
Termites?" 

"It's this snow, Captain. We 
walk two or three miles and it 
stops. It don't make sense." 

"It's got to stop sometime." 

"The point is, Captain, it didn't 
snow here at all. There's none 
on the ground. It just snowed 
around the ship." 

It cost Lamoureux an effort to 
admit it, but McCracken was 
right. He was not as stupid as he 
had seemed. ' 

It was Lamoureux* s turn to 
scowl. He got in touch with the 
ship. "Haskell!" 

"Yes, sir?" 

"How's the weather where you 
are?" 

"Are you joking, Captain?" 
"I'm serious, Haskell. Is it 
clear?" 

"It's still snowing, Captain, just 
as it was less than an hour ago 
when you left." 

Lamoureux grunted. "You may 
be interested to know that it 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



93 



hasn't snowed here at all." 

He cut off Haskell's astonished 
voice, and turned to the others, 
who now seemed a little uneasy. 
The unexpected changes, in the 
weather were a little too much 
for them. 

"Now that it's cleared up, we 
should be able to find that mountain. We'll spread out just a little, 
but not too far. For all we know, 
it may start to snow again. Carvalho, you take your group off 
to the left—" 

Sprott whispered, "Captain!" 

"Yes?" 

"Isn't that a Mercurian?" 

T AMOUREUX stared where 
Sprott had pointed. About a 
half mile away, a small gray creature, looking, as McCracken had 
reported, like a penguin, but with 
a broader face and no bill to 
speak of, was standing motionless. 

"Sprott, you and Marsden go 
over to that thing. Be as friendly as you know how. Smile, grin, 
stand on your head if you have 
to, but don't scare it away. Try 
to induce it to follow you here. 
Maybe we'll finally get some of 
that information about Kalinoff 
we're looking for." 

Sprott and Marsden were approaching the Mercurian cautiously. Several hundred yards 
away, they stopped and spread 
their arms in what was evidently 



meant to be a gesture of good 
will. 

The Mercurian remained motionless. Not until the men had 
come within thirty feet of it did 
it give a sign of life. Then it took 
a step toward them. 

As Lamoureux watched, the 
two men spoke a few words. The 
Mercurian did not respond, but 
when they turned around and 
moved away, it followed slowly. 

Seen from close at hand, the 
Mercurian did not so greatly resemble a penguin. To begin with, 
it had no wings, and no arms 
either. It lacked a bill altogether, 
but had instead a small mouth 
that seemed crammed with teeth. 
Its two eyes were slanted, which 
gave it an appearance of slyness. 
There were two round tufted ears. 
It moved forward not by waddling, but with a smooth rollercoaster gait that was the result 
of its moving its four legs forward 
one after the other. 

Sprott reported, "It seems 
hurt." 

There was, in fact, a grayish 
wound on the Mercurian's chest. 
Lamoureux didn't know enough 
about Mercurian physiology to 
hazard a guess as to what would 
be the best treatment; and, therefore, decided to leave well enough 
alone. But, according to Kalinoff, 
the Mercurians were intelligent. 
He wondered if the screwball explorer had taught this one any of 



94 




 




the Earth languages. 

"Can you speak English?" 

The Mercurian stared at him 
with its sly expression and said 
nothing. 

"Parlez-vous frangais? Sprechen sie Deutsch?" 

The men were grinning now, 
and Lamoureux felt his face growing warm. He must look like a 
fool, trying to carry on a conversation with a bird. 

He asked, "Anybody here know 
Russian? Polish? Spanish?" 

T¥IS men supplied him with 
phrases in the languages he 
asked for, but the Mercurian remained unresponsive. 

McCracken ventured, "He 
don't look very bright to me, Captain. I can't understand why Kalinoff said they were intelligent." 

"Maybe," suggested Sprott, 
"it's because they just stand 
there looking wise and don't say 
anything." 

Lamoureux shook his head. 
"Kalinoff wouldn't be impressed 
by anybody's just looking wise. 
And he wouldn't be impressed by 
anybody's not saying anything. 
He didn't go for either stuffed 
shirts or strong silent men. That's 
why I believe that this thing must 
have a language of its own, and a 
fairly decent brain." 

The Mercurian closed its two 
eyes slowly, like a sleepy cat, and 
opened them again. Then it pok


THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



95 



ed one of its four feet out from 
under its body and scratched on 
the ground. 

"He's nuts," decided McCracken. "Just scrabbling around." 

"Hold it," ordered Lamoureux, 
"I'm beginning to get this." 

The Mercurian had scratched 
nine parallel lines, only a few 
of them visible on the rocky 
ground. Now it scratched other 
lines, perpendicular to these. 

Lamoureux barked, "A checkerboard! That's what it is! Has 
anybody got one?" 

Marsden had a pocket chess set. 
He took it out. The Mercurian's 
eyes brightened. It sat down suddenly on the hard ground. 

"I'll be damned," said Lamoureux. "He wants to play a 
game. Go ahead, Marsden. Entertain our guest." 

The men were grinning again. 
Marsden squatted down on the 
ground and began to set up the 
men. The Mercurian stretched 
out two of its paws — three-fingered affairs, the fingers almost human — and seized one white chessman and one black. It hid the 
paws behind its back, then held 
them out again. 

Marsden chose the white, and 
moved forward the queen's pawn. 
The Mercurian countered and 
the game was on. 

It was Kalinoff who must have 
taught this creature the game, 
and, if it did nothing else, the 



incident showed that the explorer 
was just as screwy as ever, and 
probably alive somewhere on the 
planet. Or did it merely show 
that he had been alive? Lamoureux, undecided, watched the curious battle of wits. 

Half an hour later, Marsden, 
thoroughly beaten, demanded, 
"Who says this thing isn't intelligent?" 

Ill 

THE Mercurian was sitting up, 
wagging its head from side to 
side as if waiting for approbation. 
But Lamoureux, quite sure now 
that it wouldn't or couldn't talk, 
wouldn't have given a damn if it 
had beaten every champion on 
Earth. In addition, he was bothered by the fact that it was snowing again. 

The flakes had just begun to 
fall, large and feathery, and Lamoureux himself soon had a powdered look. Most of the other 
men were still gathered around 
the Mercurian. But one of them, 
Sprott, came over to Lamoureux 
and glanced up at the sky as if 
puzzled. 

"It's following us around, Captain." 

"What is?" 
"The snow, sir." 
"Don't be silly, Sprott. We just 
happen to have run into a stre&k 
of bad weather." 



96 




 



Sprott went on stubbornly, "It 
looks funny to me. First it rains 
and snows for ten days around 
the ship. But it doesn't rain, or 
at least it doesn't snow, here. An 
hour after we get to this place, 
though, it starts coming down." 

Lamoureux brushed some of 
the white flakes off his shoulders. 
"All right, Sprott, suppose you 
are right. It is following us 
around. That's no reason to 
alarm the other men, is it?" 

"I guess not, sir ... I won't 
say a word. But there's something 
else I wanted to speak to you v 
about, sir. It's McCracken." 

"You believe he's responsible 
for the snow?" 

Sprott looked astonished. "I 
don't mean that, sir. I don't see 
how he could be." 

"I do. He shot a Mercurian. I 
have an idea that they're the 
ones who are causing the peculiar 
weather we've been having." 

"Why would they do that, sir?" 

"Well, Kalinoff didn't mention 
seeing any weapons among them, 
so we've always assumed they 
had none. But suppose the weather was their weapon. It's a very 
eff ective one, Sprott. They've 
made things damnably unpleasant for us." 

"How can they make rain 
where there isn't any. Captain? I 
know that rainmakers on Earth 
have had some success. But all 
they do is get the rain to fall near 



where it would have fallen anyway. They may make it precipitate a few hours before it would 
have otherwise, but that's all . 
Here there weren't any clouds to 
start with." 

Lamoureux admitted, "I don't 
know how the trick is done , 
Sprott. But I agree with you that 
the snow is following us around, 
and I'm sure that the trick is 
done." 

^PROTT was silent a moment. 
^ Then he said, "And you think, 
sir, it's all because McCracken 
shot one of them?" 

"They evidently believe in the 
principle of the rain falling on 
the just and unjust alike. And the 
same thing goes for the snow." 

Sprott said doubtfully, "I'm 
not sure about that, sir. But I do 
know that McCracken is up to 
something. He's been getting 
some queer noises on his receiver." 

"Such as Haskell singing lullabies from the ship?" 

"Nothing as unpleasant as that, 
Captain. They're just a series of 
sounds, some a little longer than 
others. Da, da, da-a-a, da — that 
sort of thing." 

Lamoureux asked, "When did 
you hear them?" 

"About ten minutes ago. McCracken doesn't know anything 
about chess, and neither do I, so 
we both wandered away after the 
first ten minutes. McCracken said 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



97 



he had an idea where those mountains were." 

Lamoureux's eyes narrowed. 
"Those noises are undoubtedly a 
message. I seem to remember that 
some centuries back there was a 
code invented by a man named 
Morris. That's it, the Morris code. 
But where could such a message 
have come from?" 

Sprott shook his head. "I 
couldnt say, sir. There's supposed to be no one but Kalinoff on 
Mercury, and his radio set doesn't 
work. Could the message have 
been sent from Earth?" 

"Impossible, Sprott. That ^set 
will hardly get more than twelve 
thousand miles." 

Sprott looked uncomfortable. 
"Then maybe what I heard 
wasn't a message at all, sir." 

"I think it was. Does McCracken know you overheard him?" 

"I don't think so, sir." 

"Then don't let him know that 
we suspect anything wrong. Come 
to think of it, McCracken never 
seems to act quite as stupid as 
he pretends to be. I shouldn't be 
surprised if, when he shot that 
Mercurian, he understood very 
well what he was doing." 

"You believe, sir, that he deliberately tried to cause trouble? 
Why would he do that?" 

"I don't know," said Lamoureux slowly. 

That wasn't the whole truth. 
He didn't know, but he certainly 



could make a shrewd guess. All 
along, his chief reason for fearing 
delay on this expedition had been 
that Kalinoff might die before he 
could get to him. Now there was 
another reason for fearing delay. 
Suppose there were another expedition on the way to rescue 
Kalinoff. And suppose McCracken was secretly in the pay of the 
people behind that expedition, 
and doing everything possible to 
sabotage this one. 

Lamoureux nodded to himself. 
That was probably it. The first 
thing, then, was to get the radio 
set from McCracken. 

BIG Muscles, as the other men 
had nicknamed McCracken, 
was a few hundred feet away, 
staring off into the distance. What 
else he could see besides snow, 
Lamoureux couldn't guess. He 
yelled, "Hey, McCracken!" 
"Coming, Captain.'* 
McCracken took a few tentative steps, broke into a short run, 
and then made a leap that carried him seventy-five feet through 
the. air, past where Lamoureux 
was standing. He ended up at attention, his hand raised, in a military salute. 

Lamoureux frowned. Knowing 
what he did about McCracken, 
this attempt to seem carefree, 
childish, and perhaps a little stupid impressed him unfavorably. 
He said, "McCracken, I'm taking 



GA1AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



you out of Carvalho's group and 
putting you into my own. I may 
need some strong-arm work and 
you're just the man for it." 

"I sure am, Captain." 

"Seeing as I already have a 
radio, you may as well turn yours 
over to Carvalho." 

McCracken seemed a trifle less 
eager. "It's rather heavy, Captain. If you'd like, I'd carry it for 
you just the same." 

"I prefer to have my own where 
I can get at it whenever the need 
arises. Turn yours over to Carvalho, McCracken." 

"Yes, sir. Meanwhile, I want to 
report, sir, that from where I was 
standing when you called to me, 
I think I could see those mountains." 

Lamoureux had his doubts, but 
he kept them to himself. "Good," 
he said briefly. "We'll get going." 

He called the men together 
again and gave them their marching orders. Whether the Mercurian understood what he said, 
Lamoureux didn't know. At any 
rate, it went along willingly. 

They reached the place where 
McCracken had been standing, 
and Lamoureux stared where Big 
Muscles pointed. There were two 
mountains rising off in the distance, barely visible through the 
snow, and there was certainly a 
saddleback ridge between them. 
The only trouble was that one 
of the mountains was almost 



twice the height of the other. 
Kalinoff had reported them as 
approximately the same height. 

"That doesn't fit Kalinoff' s description." 

McCracken said, "Maybe he 
looked at them from a different 
angle, sir. Then they might have 
seemed the same height." 

"If he looked at them from a 
different angle, the ridge would 
no longer seem saddlebacked." 

"That's true, sir. But then you 
know, sir, Kalinoff is a screwball—" 

Lamoureux found this a little 
hard to take from a man he suspected of quietly trying to stab 
him in the back. But he continued 
to hide his feelings. "That's as 
may be, McCracken, but he's not 
cockeyed. These aren't the mountains he described. Still, we may 
as well approach them. We may 
be able to get a good view from 
the top of the taller one." 

JXiHEY moved onward again. A 
quarter of an hour's marching 
took them to the edge of the falling snow. As they walked further, 
the air became completely clear, 
and Lamoureux could see the 
mountains without straining his 
eyes. There was no doubt about 
it. They were nor the mountains 
Kalinoff had described. 

The Mercurian horizon was 
not so far away as the more familiar horizon of Earth, and it was 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



99 




100 



GALAXY 



SCIENCE FICTION 



a little difficult for Lamoureux to 
estimate distances. Still, the foothills of the mountains could not 
be more than twenty miles away. 
For the past day, little more than 
the rim of the Sun had been visible above the horizon, and while 
the peaks were ablaze with scarlet 
and golden colors, only the higher 
one was out of the shadow to 
any considerable extent. The saddlebacked ridge itself was a vague 
outline of dull black. 

The snow did not catch up with 
them until four or five hours 
later, when they stopped to prepare a meal and rest. Then it 
began to fall gently after they had 
been in the same place for threequarters of an hour. By now, 
Lamoureux was sure that it was 
the Mercurians who were to 
blame. He still wondered how 
they did it. 

The one they had come across 
had remained with them, and 
Lamoureux found it harder than 
ever to regard the creature as intelligent. All the thing had done 
was walk and play chess. Lamoureux had a low opinion of chess 
players, even when they were 
fairly human. He had an even 
lower opinion of trained animals. 
This Mercurian fell, in his estimation, somewhere between. 

They were no more than a mile 
or two from the foothills of the 
larger mountain by now, and the 
saddlebacked ridge loomed sev


eral hundred feet into the air. 
Unfortunately, the snow was between it and them, and prevented 
them from gaining too clear a 
view. Lamoureux wondered if the 
snow would keep up even at the 
top of the mountain, and damned 
McCracken again for shooting 
that Mercurian. And then he discovered that McCracken's feats 
of arms were not yet ended. McCracken was at that very moment 
aiming at some target that Lamoureux could not see. 

Lamoureux sprang to his feet. 
"Don't shoot, you fool!" 

He was a little too late. The 
noise of the explosion rang out. 
McCracken said, "Sorry, sir, I 
didn't hear you until my finger 
had already squeezed the trigger. 
But I wasn't trying to hit anything that was alive. There was 
something that looked like a rock 
on that ridge — " 

The words died away in his 
throat. Lamoureux lifted his eyes 
and saw something hovering in 
front of them, high in the air. It 
had eyes and a mouth and, from 
these features, he knew that it 
was a huge head, as large as a 
fair-sized house. There was a 
long, interminable stretch of neck 
behind it, and somewhere in the 
rear he felt sure was a monstrous 
body. But he wasted no time 
searching for that. 

The eyes were staring at the 
men unblinkingly. These eyes 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



101 



alone were bigger than the men 
were. Then the neck stretched out 
and the head came poking down, 

T AMOUREUX turned and ran. 

It had been years since he 
had done much physical exercise, 
but he made up for them now. 
Then, too, as the captain of the 
expedition, he felt that the men 
might expect a certain amount of 
leadership from him; it was with 
some dismay that he discovered 
that all the rest were ahead of 
him. Picking up speed, he passed 
Sprott, then Marsden, and then 
Gronski. Ahead of him someone 
stumbled, and Lamoureux wasted 
a precious second helping the man 
to his feet. 

The huge head opened, and a 
roar that almost knocked out his 
eardrums vibrated through Lamoureux's body. The ground shook 
under him. That meant that the 
whole creature, whatever it was, 
was coming after them. Gronski 
and Sprott passed him as if someone had stuck a needle into them, 
and Lamoureux, sobbing for 
breath, tripped over a rock and 
plunged headlong. 

The ground beside him trembled as if it were being rocked by 
a series of quakes. A deep shadow 
fell over him, and Lamoureux 
tried to dig his prone body into 
the ground and not breathe. From 
far ahead, a scream of terror split 
the air. 



Then the quakes and the shadow had passed, and Lamoureux 
dared to lift his head. Far ahead, 
he could make out the gigantic 
neck stretching into the air, its 
outline already vague through 
the falling snow. A few feet away 
from him lay Gronski, and a little further on McCracken. 

None of the other men were in 
sight. 

The valiant McCracken, his 
rifle still clutched to him, was 
aiming at the vanishing figure. 
Lamoureux said, "Don't bother, 
McCracken. You've already done 
enough harm." 

"I just thought I'd get a shot 
at him, sir, while he was excited. 
He wouldn't know where it came 
from." 

"He knew the first time. Don't 
bother, I say. You can't hurt him, 
and he can do plenty to you." 

"All right, Captain." 

Lamoureux brushed some of 
the snow off him and tried to 
catch his breath. "McCracken, if 
you're really anxious to play with 
your gun, you may fire into the 
air. Five times." 

"Yes, sir." 

McCracken fired, and they 
waited. Lamoureux said, "I hope 
nobody was hurt. I don't think 
any of them, if they're alive, are 
too far away to hear those shots. 
We'll wait for them to assemble 
here and then start out for those 
mountains again." 



102 




 



"Yes, sir. Except, Captain, that 
it may be a little difficult — " 

"What'll be difficult?" 

"Finding those mountains. 
They just don't look the same." 

Lamoureux stared. The mountains stretched into the air exactly the same as before, the same 
scarlet and gold colors glowing 
on their peaks, the same shadows 
on their sides. But the saddlebacked ridge between them — 

Lamoureux looked again. The 
entire ridge was gone. 

IV 

rw^HE snow fell as steadily as 
ever while Lamoureux waited 
for the men to assemble. Only 
two were missing now — Terrill 
and Carvalho. McCracken had 
fired again and again into the air, 
but these two had not returned. 

Lamoureux decided finally, "It 
looks as if they're not coming. 
Gronski, you take over for Carvalho. You'll stay here in charge 
of his group while the rest of us 
climb the mountain." 

McCracken said, "You want 
me to come with you, don't you, 
Captain?" 

"I certainly do. I'm curious to 
know what in hell way of ruining 
this expedition you'll think of 
next." 

"Aw, now, Captain, that isn't 
fair. How was I to know that 
whole ridge was one big animal? 



You wouldn't have believed it 
yourself. Something over five 
hundred feet high, with a neck 
even longer. We're not used to 
them that big on Earth. Here the 
gravity's less, so it's okay. But 
even Kalinoff — " 

"Don't talk to me about Kalinoff," said Lamoureux fiercely. 
"He's as bad as you. That screwball!" 

"We're still trying to find him, 
aren't we, Captain?" 

"Sure, we're trying to find him, 
but how can we expect to do it?" 
Was it his imagination, or did 
McCracken seem pleased? Lamoureux didn't care. He Went on, 
very bitterly, "He starts off by 
telling us that the Mercurians are 
intelligent. You saw how intelligent they were. Where's that 
specimen we had?" 

"He got lost in the shuffle," reported Gronski. 

"It's just as well. Kalinoff tells 
us of a landmark — two mountains with a saddlebacked ridge 
between them. The ridge runs 
away, and our landmark isn't a 
landmark any more. Then there's 
the weather — no rain, no hail, no 
snow. Nothing but pure fresh air 
and nice clean sunshine." He 
kicked at a snowdrift. "What's 
this thing supposed to be, a mirage?" 

McCracken said, "I know how 
you feel, Captain. But about this 
mountain now — do you really 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



103 



think we ought to climb it?" 
"Why not?" 

"You can't see the top from 
here on account of the snow. It's 
coming down in bigger flakes than 
ever now. That means you can't 
see here from the top. And as the 
only reason we want to climb it 
is to take a look around — " 

"We'll climb it anyway. Maybe 
it isn't snowing as hard on the 
other side." 

rpHEY started off then, with 
Lamoureux barely keeping a 
tight enough grip on his feelings 
to prevent his talking to himself. 
The mountain was steep, but the 
gravity here being low, it was 
easy enough to climb. McCracken demonstrated how easy it was 
by running up it full speed. Lamoureux let him go, hoping that he 
would break his neck, but McCracken's luck was too good. All 
he did was start a gentle landslide 
that almost buried everybody 
else. 

As they rose, they got more and 
more of the Sun's rays and the 
temperature went up slightly. The 
snow turned to rain, drenching 
them to the skin, and they climbed all the faster, anxious to get 
the job over with. 

At the top, the rain had died 
down to a faint drizzle. Lamoureux, looking off into the distance, could see as through a veil 
a range of sky-piercing moun
104 G 



tains, their peaks gleaming in the 
Sun, their roots cleft with deep 
shadowed valleys . Between almost every pair of mountains was 
a saddlebacked ridge. 

"Landmarks," commented 
Lamoureux sourly. "To hell with 
them." 

"I told you it would be a waste 
of time, Captain." 

"Not in the least, McCracken. 
After all, you might have broken 
your neck," 

They started down again, and 
in a half hour were back at the 
line where the rain changed to 
snow. Another hour took theni 
to Gronski again. 

Lamoureux shook his head. 
"No sigh of Kalinoff." 

"What do we do now?" 

"We go back to the ship and 
carry on from there. I don't know 
what steps we'll take after that, 
but at least we'll get back to 
shelter, out of this snow." 

"Which way is the ship?" 

"That," said Lamoureux, "is 
one question we can find the answer to." He spoke into his radio. 
"Haskell!" 

Haskell was alert. "Yes, Captain." 

"Keep your radio beam going. 
We're depending on it for direction." 

"Sure, Captain." 

Lamoureux snapped off the 
sending set. "Now let's get moving, before we freeze to death," 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The return trip was a slow one. 
Their spirits were all low, even 
McCracken's. Lamoureux pictured the return to Earth, the 
eager, and then disappointed, reception, and the wave of ridicule 
that would follow their account of 
the difficulties they had encountered. 

They stopped once to eat. Lamoureux estimated that they had 
supplies for another two and a 
half months left in the ship, not 
counting what would be needed 
for the return journey. They 
might as well stay here until those 
supplies were used up. They 
might possibly find Kalinoff during those two and a half months, 
although, with the Twilight Zone 
of the whole planet to look in, 
and no decent clues, not to mention the difficulties caused by the 
snow, the chances were none too 
bright, Nevertheless, they would 
have to do their best. 

The meal came to an end, and 
they started off again. They had 
gone only a few hundred yards, 
when Lamoureux noticed something wrong. \ 

"Haskell!" 

There was no |eply. Haskell's 
radio beam had been shut off. 

rwiHIS was a little too much. 

Lamoureux let loose a, streak 
of profanity that had even McCracken staring at him in awe. 
Then they started out again, try


ing, through the falling snow, and 
over the rocky ground, to keep 
in as straight a line as possible 
toward the ship. Lamoureux managed to sustain his spirits only by 
thinking of what he would do to 
his cook. 

Two hours later, he had an 
opportunity to put his plan into 
practice. For out of the snow 
there emerged Haskell, and the 
men who had been left with him 
at the ship. Haskell started to 
run toward Lamoureux the moment he caught sight of the other 
group. 

"Here we are, Captain! We 
came as fast as we could!" 

Lamoureux's eyes were almost 
as cold as the snow. "How 
thoughtful of you." 

"Who else is hurt, Captain?" 

"Nobody's hurt, but somebody is going to be." 

Haskell looked surprised. "I 
don't get it. You told me to come 
as fast as I could, and you said 
that eight of the men were badly 
injured.*' 

"Z told you?" 

"Yes, sir. I thought you were 
hurt yourself, sir. Your voice 
sounded hoarse." 

Lamoureux's jaws were clenched together so tightly in his. effort 
to maintain his self-control that 
his teeth hurt. He unclenched 
them. "I don't quite understand 
you, Haskell. My voice is as 
melodious as ever. Something else 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



105 



is strange, too. You ask who else 
is hurt." 

"Yes, sir. We ran across Terrill 
a little while ago. He got brushed 
by the tail of some animal and 
was walking around in a real 
daze." 

"How do you suppose we're 
walking? At any rate, I'm glad 
you found him. See any signs of 
Carvalho?" 

"No, sir. We left the radio 
beam on to guide you — " 

"What's that? You're sure you 
left it on?" 

"Positive, sir." 

"Well, someone has turned it 
off! Someone — Oh, my God!" 

It was so damn simple, and he 
had never eve n th ought of it . 
Carvalho was the man. Carvalho 
was shrewd and quiet, a man 
who could keep his intentions to 
himself and wreck an expedition 
without so much as being suspected. Subconsciously, Lamoureux hadn't quite believed in McCracken's guilt, despite the seeming evidence against him. McCracken had too genuine a love 
of horseplay, and of childish 
showing off. 

These things were hard to pretend. You didn't put snow down 
somebody's back when you were 
plotting to leave him marooned 
on a deserted planet. And you 
didn't impress people by making 
a seventy-five foot broad jump 
when you could impress them 



much more effectively by condemning them to slow death. 

ONCE he had thought of it, 
Lamoureux couldn't doubt. 
Carvalho had turned off the radio 
beam at the ship. By now the 
Astrotight was probably somewhere in space, possibly proceeding to some rendezvous with a 
rival expedition. Carvalho 
wouldn't dare appear back on 
Earth as the lone passenger returning on Lamoureux's ship. But 
he wouldn't have to. He could 
set the Astrotight adrift, be "rescued" by the people who had employed him, and come back to 
tell of the dangers he had braved 
on Mercury. 

It all fitted in. Carvalho had 
been the one who had tried to 
hamper their work from the moment they had landed. When McCracken had shot that Mercurian — 

Lamoureux asked, "What happened then? Try to remember." 

McCracken scratched his head 
vigorously. "I think Carvalho 
saw this Mercurian and started 
to yell and run. I thought he was 
scared. That's why I shot." 

So Carvalho had really been 
responsible for the shooting. Lamoureux asked, "Why didn't you 
report that Carvalho started to 
yell and run?" 

"Well, Captain, you don't expect me to go around telling you 



106 




 



things like that about another 
guy?" 

The words, "You fool," had 
been on Lamoureux's lips, but he 
bit them back. After all, who had 
been the bigger fool, McCracken 
or he himself, who had insisted 
that Carvalho get the radio? 
There was no doubt about the 
answer to that one. 

As for the occasion when the 
radio had begun to emit its mysterious code signals, the explanation for that was simple enough, 
too. The people who were in contact with Carvalho had sent their 
messages, not knowing whether 
strangers might be listening in, 
but not caring either. No one 
could make head or tail of the 
mysterious sounds but Carvalho. 
McCracken had, in fact, considered the noises a new strange 
form of static that had interefered 
when he tried to talk to Haskell. 

Lamoureux felt like asking McCracken to kick him in the pants. 
As that would have been bad for 
discipline, he substituted an order to get started back toward the 
ship. There was the faintest of 
chances that Carvalho had delayed, or had been forced by some 
accident to delay, his departure 
back to Earth. 

It was snowing harder than 
ever now, and it was difficult for 
Lamoureux to see more than fifty 
feet ahead of him. The rim of 
the Sun was blotted out so thor


oughly that it was almost as dark 
as on a moonless night. Nevertheless he pressed on doggedly. 

It was not until six hours later, 
after he and the men had been 
wandering around aimlessly for 
a long enough time to have reached the ship and returned, that he 
admitted to himself that they 
were lost. 

V 

]\JOT that it mattered a great 
^- " deal. Lamoureux realized 
perfectly well that by this time 
the Astrolight was on its return 
journey to Earth. All the same, it 
was disheartening to know that 
he was so completely unable to 
find his way about on this planet. 

The question now was what to 
do. They had little enough food, 
and not too much in the way of 
other supplies.- They would have 
to live off the planet until some 
kind of rescue expedition had 
been organized to save them. If 
Kalinoff had done it, they could, 
too. Lamoureux's face burned as 
he pictured himself striding over 
to Kalinoff, staring at the man 
solemnly, and uttering those historic words, "Dr. Livingston, I 
presume." That was one scene 
that would never take place. 

It was growing colder by the 
hour. That meant that they 
would have to move over toward 
the Hot Side before the Sun sank 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



107 



beneath the horizon altogether. 

McCracken, the most cheerful 
of the lot, had a glum face as he 
asked, "What do we do now, Captain?" 

"First we eat, McCracken. 
Then we move toward the Sun. 
Just one word, McCracken. You 
like to shoot?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Save your bullets. I have an 
idea we're going to need them 
before this little adventure of ours 
is finished." 

Then Lamoureux sat down on 
a snowy rock, 'leaned back, and 
thought everything over. It was 
improbable now that any of his 
kids would ever get to Lunar 
Tech. Well, that wasn't anything 
to be sorry about. The life of 
ease and luxury of the place had 
ruined more than one promising 
youngster. His wife would have 
to get along with a single robot. 
It would do her good to wait on 
the family for a change. As for 
his relatives — to hell with them. 
Let them find somebody else to 
sponge on. 

He was busy with these cheerful reflections when he heard 
McCracken shout, "Hey!" 

A figure loomed out of the 
snow ahead. 

The figure paused and stared 
at Lamoureaux. 

McCracken yelled, "Hey, Captain!" 

The figure came forward, bow


ed, and showed its teeth. "Mr. 
Stanley, I presume?" 

¥ OOKING back at it later, 
Lamoureux decided that this 
was the most mortifying moment 
of his life. He had been sent to 
save Kalinoff. 

Instead, Kalinoff had saved 
him. 

It was the screwball explorer, 
of course. Lamoureux recognized 
him at once. Kalinoff was a 
shrimp, a fraction of an inch 
below five feet in height, and he 
had a face like a monkey's. Having taken a good look at him, 
Lamoureux felt, "My God, is this 
what we've been trying to rescue?" 

Kalinoff was not alone. He was 
accompanied by a pair of penguin-like Mercurians, who looked 
just as sly and acted with as 
little intelligence as the one they 
had previously encountered. Lamoureux had no idea how Kalinoff 
had managed to get along with 
them. 

Kalinoff, it seemed, was angry. 
"Why in hell," he demanded, 
"didn't you have sense enough to 
return to the ship?" 

Lamoureux stared. 

"You mean the Astrolight is 
still here?" 

"Of course it's here. And the 
radio beam is on." 

"You're sure — the beam is on?" 

"Of all the nitwits to let loose 



108 




 



on an unfriendly planet, you're 
about the worst. I've just told 
you it's on, haven't I? It's been 
on for the past two hours." 

Lamoureux swallowed hard. 
"And Carvalho?" 

"There's a man who I assume 
is Carvalho. He's tied up. I've 
got a couple of friends watching 
him to make sure he doesn't get 
away." 

"Friends?" 

"Like these." Kalinoff indicated the Mercurians. "Come on. I'd 
like to get back to Earth. There's 
a girl I've got to see." 

"But who — what happened to 
Carvalho?" 

"He seemed anxious to leave, 
so I pushed my fist down his 
throat. Incidentally, there was a 
radio going, with a code message." 

"Short distance, radio?" 

"Interplanetary. The ship's hull 
acted as a receiver, naturally. 
You could get the message anywhere on the planet by arranging 
a short distance automatic rebroadcast." 

"So that's what Carvalho did." 

"If I'm late this time," said 
Kalinoff worriedly, "she and I 
are finished. She's willing to put 
up with dates six months in advance, but there's a limit, and 
I've been late too often. And she's 
too nice to lose. Get a move on, 
quick." 

Lamoureux, in a daze, com


plied. They were only an hour's 
journey from the ship, and, under 
Kalinoff s urging, they made it 
in forty minutes. Carvalho, looking terrified of the two Mercurians who were standing over him 
with their teeth showing, yelled, 
"Help!" 

"Never mind him," Kalinoff 
ordered. "Hop into the ship." 

"But what are we going to do 
with him?" 

"Well, what's he been up to?" 

LAMOUREUX explained briefly, and Kalinoff grunted. 
"You fellows are a bunch of 
screwballs, setting out on an expedition like this without proper 
equipment and proper information about Mercury." At the word 
"screwballs," Lamoureux winced, 
but remained silent. Maybe it 
was deserved. Kalinoff went on, 
"As for Carvalho, that's simple. 
Leave him behind. He intended 
to maroon you, didn't he? Maroon him instead. But first let 
him send one interplanetary radio 
message to his friends." 

"In code? We won't know what 
it is!" 

Kalinoff grinned. "We'll leave 
his punishment up to him. Suppose he reports you've found me. 
Then his pals won't come for 
him, and he's going to stay here 
indefinitely." 

"What if he reports you haven't 
been found?" 



THE WEATHER ON MERCURY 



109 



"Then they come for him, discover he's a liar, and there's hell 
to pay. Either way, he's in for a 
lousy time." 

"They'll murder him." 

"Oh, no. We'll let them know 
that we're reporting the facts of 
the case to the Interplanetary 
Commission. They'd never dare 
commit murder." 

Lamoureux objected doubtfully, "Wouldn't the Mercurians 
kill him?" 

"If he treats them right, they'll 
treat him right. They're not as 
intelligent as I thought at first — 
maybe you've discovered that — 
but they have their points." 

"They're wonderful chess players." 

"Fair," said Kalinoff critically. 
"Only fair. I always beat them, 
but then, naturally, I'm very 
good. Maybe that's why they admire me. They have great mathematical abilities, and they can 
visualize well, but their language 
is primitive and in some ways 
they're halfwits. There have been 
plenty of mathematical prodigies 
on Earth just like them — wonders 
at calculating, and fools at everything else. To hell with them. 
Let's get started." 

"Wait a minute, Kalinoff. What 
about those huge beasts? Won't 
they be dangerous to Carvalho?" 

"Oh, them." Kalinoff chuckled. 
"I certainly gave you some offbeam instructions before that 

110 


radio of mine went on the blink. 
I really thought at first that those 
two mountains I described with 
the saddlebacked ridge between 
them would make a good landmark. Two days afterward. I discovered that the ridges were living creatures. The things have a 
habit of sheltering themselves 
from the Sun between a pair of 
mountains. They wrap their necks 
around their bodies, tuck their 
heads beside them, and you'd 
never know they were alive. They 
don't move for days at a time." 
"But when they do move — " 
"Leave them alone, and they 
leave you alone." 




'HE Captain asked, "What 
about the rain and snow?" 



"I may as well clear this up 
once and for all. The rain and 
snow were my doing. After I had 
told you to rely on the Mercurians and described the landmark, 
I discovered that the Mercurians 
were nitwits and the landmark a 
false alarm. That meant that, 
once you landed, you'd never 
find me except by accident. That 
put it up to me to find you. 

"As you may have heard, normally there's no such thing as 
rain or snow on Mercury. But 
there is water. And there is a 
continual process of transfer going on. The water flows through 
subterranean channels to the Hot 
Side, evaporates, and is carried 


 



over in the air to the Cold Side. 
There it deposits on the ground 
eventually as ice, melts, and goes 
through the whole process again." 

"Why doesn't it rain?" 

"Because there's no dust in 
Mercury's air. The absence of a 
rapidly alternating day and night 
means that the air doesn't circulate on the same scale as on 
Earth. Practically no wind, combined with little erosion, means 
little dust. The water-laden air 
cools off and becomes super-saturated at the Twilight Zone. But 
there are no clouds, and there's 
no precipitation because the water 
needs either dust or ions to condense on. In a Wilson cloud 
chamber, an experimenter furnishes it with ions. Here on Mercury I furnished it with dust. 

"I gave the Mercurians rifles 
and explosive bullets, and taught 
them to shoot into the air. It was 
quite a job, but they learned. The 
explosion spreads a cloud of dust, 
the water condenses, and you 
have rain or snow, depending on 
the temperature. I impressed it 
upon their brains, such as they 
are, that the presence of human 
beings calls for a Fourth of July 
celebration — shooting into the air. 



And there you are. I had the 
occurrence of rain and snow reported to me, moved toward 
wherever the snow was thickest, 
and found the ship." 

"Another thing — " 

"I've talked enough. That 
dame won't wait forever. Which 
will it be, Carvalho, the Lady or 
the Tiger?" 

They listened in curiosity as 
Carvalho, tight-lipped, tapped 
out a short message in code. They 
didn't ask him what it was. , 

As the Astrolight drove upward away from Mercury, Lamoureux had one last glimpse of 
the Mercurians shooting into the 
air. The snow was"coming down 
in enormous flakes two inches 
across, and Carvalho, staring after the ship, was shivering and 
cursing. After they reported the 
facts to the Interplanetary Commission, a ship would be sent to 
pick him up — but it might take 
some time. 

"Let me tell you about this 
dame," said Kalinoff. 

Lamoureux listened patiently, 
got out his contract, and waited, 
with pen ready, for the interplanetary screwball's signature.

THE WEATHER ON MERCURY

A BAD DAY 
FOR SALES 



By FRITZ LEIBER 

Don't wait to "Get 'em while 
they're hot" By then, ft is 
too late to get them at all! 

Hlustratcd by EMSH 



THE big bright doors of 
the office building parted 
with a pneumatic whoosh 
and Robie glided onto Times 
Square. The crowd that had been 
watching the fifty -foot-tall girl 
on the clothing billboard get 
dressed, or reading the latest 
news about the Hot Truce scrawl 
itself in yard-high script, hurried 
to look. 

Robie was still a novelty. 
Robie was fun. For a little while 
yet, he could steal the show. But 
the attention did not make Robie 
proud. He had no more emotions 



than the pink plastic giantess, 
who dressed and undressed endlessly whether there was a crowd 
or the street was empty, and who 
never once blinked her blue mechanical eyes. But she merely 
drew business while Robie went 
out after it. 

For Robie was the logical conclusion of the development of 
vending machines. All the earlier 
ones had stood in one place, on a 
floor or hanging on a wall, and 
blankly delivered merchandise in 
return for coins, whereas Robie 
searched for customers. He was 



112 




 



the demonstration model of a 
line of sales robots to be manufactured by Shuler Vending Machines, provided the public invested enough in stocks to give 
the company capital to go into 
mass production. 

The publicity Robie drew stimulated investments handsomely. 
It was amusing to see the TV 
and newspaper coverage of Robie 
selling, but not a fraction as much 
fun as being approached personally by him. Those who were 
usually bought anywhere f rom 
one to five hundred shares, if they 
had any money and foresight 
enough to see that sales robots 
would eventually be on every 
street and highway in the country. 

ROBIE radared the crowd, 
found that it surrounded him 
solidly, and stopped. With a carefully built-in sense of timing, he 
waited for the tension and expectation to mount before he 
began talking. 

"Say, Ma, he doesn't look like 
a robot at all," a child said. "He 
looks like a turtle/' 

Which was not completely inaccurate. The lower part of 
Robie's body was a metal hemisphere hemmed with sponge rubber and not quite touching the 
sidewalk. The upper was a metal 
box with black holes in it. The 
box could swivel and duck. 



A chromium-bright hoopskirt 
with a turret on top. 

"Reminds me too much of the 
Little Joe Paratanks," a legless 
veteran of the Persian War muttered, and rapidly rolled himself 
away on wheels rather like Robie's. 

His departure made it easier 
for some of those who knew 
about Robie to open a path in 
the crowd. Robie headed straight 
for the gap. The crowd whooped. 

Robie glided very slowly down 
the path, deftly jogging aside 
whenever he got too close to ankles in skylon or sockassins. The 
rubber buffer on his hoopskirt 
was merely an added safeguard. 

The boy who had called Robie 
a turtle jumped in the middle 
of the path and stood his ground, 
grinning foxily. 

Robie stopped two feet short 
of him. The turret ducked. The 
crowd got quiet. 

"Hello, youngster," Robie said 
in a voice that was smooth as 
that of a TV star, and was, in 
fact, a recording of one. 

The boy stopped smiling. 
"Hello," he whispered. 

"How old are you?" Robie 
asked. 

"Nine. No, eight." 

"That's nice,'* Robie observed. 
A metal arm shot down from his 
neck, stopped just short of the 
boy. 

The boy jerked back. 



A BAD DAY FOR SALES

"For you," Robie said. 

The boy gingerly took the red 
polly-lop from the neatly fashioned blunt metal claws, and began to unwrap it. 

"Nothing to say?" asked Robie. 

"Uh — thank you." 

After a suitable pause, Robie 
continued, "And how about a 
nice refreshing drink of Poppy 
Pop to go with your polly-lop?" 
The boy lifted his eyes, but didn't 
stop licking the candy. Robie 
waggled his claws slightly. "Just 
give me a quarter and within 
five seconds — " 

A little girl wriggled out of 
the forest of legs. "Give me a 
polly-lop, too, Robie," she demanded. 

"Rita, come back here!" a woman in the third rank of the 
crowd called angrily. 

Robie scanned the newcomer 
gravely. His reference silhouettes 
were not good enough to let him 
distinguish the sex of children, 
so he merely repeated, "Hello, 
youngster." 

"Rita!" 

"Give me a polly-lop!" 

Disregarding both remarks, for 
a good salesman is single-minded 
and does not waste bait, Robie 
said winningly, "I'll bet you read 
Junior Space Killers. Now I have 
here — " 

"Uh-uh, I'm a girl. He got a 
polly-lop." 

A BAD DAY FOR SALES 



AT the word "girl," Robie 
broke off. Rather ponderously, he said, "I'll bet you read 
Gee-Gee Jones, Space Stripper. 
Now I have here the latest issue 
of that thrilling comic, not yet 
in the stationary vending machines. Just give me fifty cents 
and within five — " 

"Please let me through. I'm her 
mother." 

A young woman in the front 
rank drawled over her powdersprayed shoulder, "I'll get her 
for you," and slithered out on 
six -inch platform shoes. "Run 
away, children," she said nonchalantly. Lifting her arms behind her head, she pirouetted 
slowly before Robie to show how 
much she did for her bolero halfjacket and her form-fitting slacks 
that melted into skylon just 
above the knees. The little girl 
glared at her. She ended the 
pirouette in profile. 

At this age-level, Robie's reference silhouettes permitted him 
to distinguish sex, though with 
occasional amusing and embarrassing miscalls. He whistled admiringly. The crowd cheered. 

Someone remarked critically 
to a friend, "It would go over 
better if he was built more like 
a real robot. You know, like a 
man." 

The friend shook his head. 
"This way ifs subtler." 

No one in the crowd was 

115 



watching the newscript overhead 
as it scribbled, "Ice Pack for Hot 
Truce? Vanadin hints Russ may 
yield on Pakistan." 

Robie was saying, ". . . in the 
savage new glamor-tint we have 
christened Mars Blood, complete 
with spray applicator and fit-all 
fingerstalls that mask each finger completely except for the nail. 
Just give me five dollars — uncrumpled bills may be fed into 
the revolving rollers you see beside my arm — and within five 
seconds — " 

"No, thanks, Robie," the young 
woman yawned. 

"Remember," Robie persisted, 
"for three more weeks, seductivizing Mars Blood will be unobtainable from any other robot 
or human vendor." 

"No, thanks." 

Robie scanned the crowd resourcefully. "Is there any gentleman here . . ." he began just 
as a woman el bowed her way 
through the front rank. 

"I told you to come back!" 
she snapped at the little girl. 

"But I didn't get my pollylop!" 

", . . who would care to . . ." 
"Rita!" 

"Robie cheated. Owl" 

MEANWHILE, the young woman in the half bolero had 
scanned the nearby gentlemen 
on her own. Deciding that there 

116 < 



1 was less than a fifty per cent 
chance of any of them accepting 
the proposition Robie seemed 
about to make, she took advantage of the scuffle to slither gracefully back into the ranks. Once 
again the path was clear before 
I Robie. 

He paused, however, for a brief 
recapitulation of the more magical properties of Mars Blood, ini eluding a telling phrase about 
"the passionate claws of a Martian sunrise." 

But no one bought. It wasn't 
; quite time. Soon enough silver 
coins would be clinking, bills 
going through the rollers faster 
than laundry, and five hundred 
people struggling for the privilege of having their money taken 
away from them by America's 
first mobile sales robot. 

But there were still some tricks 
that Robie had to do free, and 
one certainly should enjoy those 
before starting the more expensive fun. 

So Robie moved on until he 
reached the curb. The variation 
in level was instantly sensed by 
his under -scanners. He stopped. 
His head began to swivel. The 
crowd watched in eager silence. 
This was Robie's best trick. 

Robie's head stopped swivel ing. His scanners had found the 
I traffic light. It was green. Robie 
i edged forward. But then the light 
turned red. Robie stopped again, 


 



still on the curb. The crowd softly ahhed its delight. 

It was wonderful to be alive 
and watching Robie on such an 
exciting day. Alive and amused 
in the fresh, weather-controlled 
air between the lines of bright 
skyscrapers with their winking 
windows and under a sky so blue 
you could almost call it dark. 

(But way, way up, where the 
crowd could not see, the sky was 
darker still. Purple-dark, with 
stars showing. And in that purple-dark, a silver- green something, the color of a bud, plunged 
down at better than three miles 
a second. The silver-green was a 
newly developed paint that foiled 
radar.) 

Robie was saying, "While we 
wait for the light, there's time for 
you youngsters to enjoy a nice 
refreshing Poppy Pop. Or for 
you adults — only those over five 
feet tall are eligible to buy — to 
enjoy an exciting Poppy Pop 
fizz. Just give me a quarter or 
-—in the case of adults, one dollar and a quarter; I'm licensed to 
dispense intoxicating liquors — 
and within five seconds . . 

But that was not cutting it 
quite fine enough. Just three seconds later, the silver-green bud 
bloomed above Manhattan into a 
globular orange flower. The skyscrapers grew brighter and 
brighter still, the brightness of 
the inside of the Sun. The win


dows winked blossoming white 
fire -flowers. 

The crowd around Robie 
bloomed, too. Their clothes puffed 
into petals of flame. Their heads 
of hair were torches. 

t | THE- orange flower grew, stem 
and blossom. The blast came. 
The winking windows shattered 
tier by tier, became black holes. 
The walls bent, rocked, cracked. 
A stony dandruff flaked from 
their cornices. The flaming flowers on the sidewalk were all leveled at once. Robie was shoved 
ten feet. His metal hoopskirt dimpled, regained its shape. 

The blast ended. The orange 
flower, grown vast, vanished overhead on its huge, magic beanstalk. It grew dark and very still. 
The cornice -dandruff pattered 
down. A few small fragments rebounded from the metal hoopskirt. 

Robie made some small, uncertain movements, as if feeling 
for broken bones. He was hunting for the traffic light, but it no 
longer shone either red or green. 

He slowly scanned a full circle. 
There was nothing anywhere to 
interest his reference silhouettes. 
Yet whenever he tried to move, 
his under -scanners warned him 
of low obstructions. It was very 
puzzling. 

The silence was disturbed by 
moans and a crackling sound, as 



A BAD DAY FOR SALES 



117 



faint at first as the scampering of 
distant rats. 

A seared man, his charred 
clothes fuming where the blast 
had blown out the fire, rose from 
the curb. Robie scanned him. 

"Good day, sir," Robie said. 
"Would you care for a smoke? 
A truly cool smoke? Now I have 
here a yet -unmarketed brand . . 

But the customer had run 
away, screaming, and Robie 
never ran after customers, though 
he could follow them at a medium brisk roll. He worked his way 
along the curb where the man 
had sprawled, carefully keeping 
his distance from the low obstructions, some of which writhed 
now and then, forcing him to jog. 
Shortly he reached a fire hydrant. He scanned it. His electronic vision, though it still 
worked, had been somewhat 
blurred by the blast. 

"Hello, youngster," Robie said. 
Then, after a long pause, "Cat 
got your tongue? Well, I have 
a little present for you. A nice, 
lovely polly-lop. 

"Take it, youngster," he said 
after another pause. "It's for you. 
Don't be afraid." i 

His attention was distracted by 
other customers, who began to 
rise up oddly here and there, 
twisting forms that confused his 
reference silhouettes and would 
not stay to be scanned properly. 
One cried, "Water," but no quar


ter clinked in Robie's claws when 
he caught the word and suggested, "How about a nice refreshing drink of Poppy Pop?" 

The rat-crackling of the flames 
had become a jungle muttering. 
The blind windows began to wink 
fire again. 

A little girl marched, stepping 
neatly over arms and legs 
she did not look at. A white dress 
and the once taller bodies around 
her had shielded her from the brilliance and the blast. Her eyes 
were fixed on Robie. In them was 
the same imperious confidence, 
though none of the delight, with 
which she had watched him earlier. 

"Help me, Robie," she said. 
"I want my mother." 

"Hello, youngster," Robbie 
said. "What would you like? 
Comics? Candy?" 

"Where is she, Robie? Take 
me to her." 

"Balloons? Would you like to 
watch me blow up a balloon?" 

The little girl began to cry. 
Thf sound triggered off another 
of Robie's novelty circuits, a 
service feature that had brought 
in a lot of favorable publicity. 

"Is something wrong?" he 
asked. "Are you in trouble? Are 
you lost?" 

"Yes, Robie. Take me to my 
mother." 

"Stay right here," Robie said 




 



reassuringly, "and don't be 
frightened. I will call a policeman." He whistled shrilly, twice. 

Time passed. Robie whistled 
again. The windows flared and 
roared. The little girl begged, 
"Take me away, Robie," and 
jumped onto a little step in his 
hoopskirt. 

"Give me a dime," Robie said. 

The little girl found one in her 
pocket and put it in his claws. 

"Your weight," Robie said, "is 
fifty-four and one-half pounds." 

"Have you seen my daughter, 
have you seen her?" a woman was 



crying somewhere. "I left her 
watching that thing while I 
stepped inside— R7ra.'" 

"Robie helped me," the little 
girl began babbling at her. "He 
knew I was lost. He even called 
the police, but they didn't come. 
He weighed me, too. Didn't you, 
Robie?" 

But Robie had gene off to peddle Poppy Pop to the members 
of a rescue squad which had just 
come around the corner, more 
robotlike in their asbestos suits 
than he in his metal skin,

FORECAST 

Next month, J. T. M'lntosh's high-tension novella, MIND ALONE, follows 
up his remarkable successes in ^his magazine. It's the story of an interstellar 
war . . . but not about who destroys how much with what weapons and 
strategy, which is really the dull side of war, but of people whipped about 
by the unleashed forces. The infuriating thing was that there was no reason 
for the colonists' revolt against Earth. But the rebels had every reason to 
conceal that fact) 

Two powerful novelets support the swift, sleek convoy of stories: 

STAMPED CAUTION by Raymond Z. Gallun very cautiously handles a 
situation that could turn explosive with only the slightest jostling. It's an 
odd fact that monsters usually seem to be of the opinion that we're the 
ones who are monsters. You know, they have a point ... it's probably a 
good idea not to argue it with them! 

•Robert Sheckley's DIPLOMATIC IMMUNITY introduces a character more 
polite and reasonable and deadly than any in history, for if Earth was 
to live as a free world, he had to die. He admitted he wasn't immortal— 
and yet nothing could kill him! 

Short stories, of course, and our regular features. Speaking of which, have 
you joined the pleased crowd of readers whose questions have been answered by Willy Ley either through the marl or in FOR YOUR INFORMATION? If any science problem is bothering you, let him know . . . right now!

GALAXY'S 

5 Star Shelf 



MODERN SCIENCE FICTION. Edited bf Reginald Bretnor. Coward McCann, New York, 
1953. 294 pages, $3.75 

THIS fascinating, exasperating 
book should be in the collection of everyone who has more 
than a passing interest in science 
fiction, despite the fact that it 
takes itself and its subject too 
seriously a good part of the time. 
It says dogmatically that science 
fiction is anything from today's 
literature of ideas to — quite simply — the literature of tomorrow. 

There is, of course, a lot that is 
valuable as information, and 



nearly as much that is important 
as evaluation. Sprague de Camp, 
on imaginative fiction, and 
Arthur Clarke, on science fiction 
as preparation for the age of 
space, both present amusing data 
on the Utopias and pre-Gernsbackian "science" fantasies that 
so thickly populated the 19th and 
early 20th Centuries. 

Anthony Boucher and Don 
Fabun give us richly informative 
discourses on science fiction publishing, and in movies, radio and 
TV. Fletcher Pratt delivers himself of some occasionally pertinent criticisms of current science 
fiction trends, fads and failures. 



120 




 



John W. Campbell, Isaac Asimov and Bretnor himself devote 
their energies to discussing how 
significant science fiction has 
been, is, or may be. It is my 
feeling that they are all a little 
too dire. Philip Wylie takes a 
characteristically negative attitude on science fiction's significance, or its values as social 
criticism. His diatribe against 
secrecy in science, however, 
should be read much more widely than it probably will be. 

Gerald Heard has a (to me) 
confusing view of science fiction's 
influences on morals and religion, 
which he says are slight today, 
but may be great tomorrow. I 
hope he is right. 

The essay I enjoyed most is 
"Science Fiction and the Main* 
Stream," by poetess Rosalie 
Moore. Here is the book's most 
perceptive analysis of science fiction's strengths, weaknesses, and 
possibilities as a literary form. 
The author compares the genre 
with other types of modern fiction, giving a very acute report that makes excellent sense 
throughout. 

Incidentally — where was Gold 
when the contributors were being 
selected? He certainly has opinions worth hearing. 

WEST OF THE SUN by Edgar 
Pangborn. Doubleday & Co., New 
York, 1953. 219 pages, $2.75 



TJERE is a first-rate tale of the 
rewards and tragedies of pioneering on a far planet that sees 
print in hard covers without prior 
serialization. Why? It is relatively slow-paced; it pays more attention to character development, 
sentiment and ideas than it does 
to plotting. 

From one point of view, the 
book is less science fiction than 
a novel of exploration in the 
Swiss Family Robinson tradition. 
Few indeed are the gadgets; missing entirely the derring-do of ordinary space opera. For those 
who like understated writing, 
warm characterizations, humanscale happenings (even when they 
happen to quite believable 
BEMs) and the lively interplay 
of moral ideas, this book will 
have a solid appeal. It is a firstrate first novel by any standard, 
science fictional or otherwise.

SENTINELS FROM SPACE by 
Eric Frank Russell. Bouregy & 
Curl, Inc., New York, 1953. 256 
pages, $2.75 

f|iHE author of Sinister Barrier 
and Dreadful Sanctuary has 
produced a third novel (serialized under the title The Star 
Watchers) which, like the first 
two. deals with the idea that Man 
is in one way or another being 
managed by extra-solar or extradimensional beings. 

The sentinels from space in the 
current tale are delightful people 
to know, for a change, and they 



are trying to help mankind, now 
spread over Venus and Mars as 
well as Earth, to avoid committing race suicide through war, if 
possible. 

It seems that space travel has 
resulted in innumerable mutations in Man, due to the hard 
radiations in space. The mutants 
possess various supernormal powers, from telepathy and teleportation to pyrotics and levitation. 
The tale tells how a plot to take 
over the triplanetary civilization 
is defeated by the sentinel David 
Raven, with the help of his opposite number on Venus, Charles 
by name. 

The story is one of the most 
inventive of the last year or so. 
It is rich with experiment in the 
mental sciences, and strong in 
its plea for sanity in our own 
lives: a fable for peace as well 
as a fine science fantasy. 

Guest reviewer Isaac Asimov 
now discusses: 

FLYING SAUCERS by Donald 
H. Menzel. Harvard University 
Press, Cambridge, Mass., 1953. 
319 pages, $4.75 

DR. Menzel, Acting Director 
of the Harvard College Observatory, does not believe in flying saucers — and proves he's right 
in authoritative and interesting 
detail in this book. 

Flying saucers are atmospheric 



122 




 



phenomena resulting from very 
usual and prosaic laws of refraction and reflection of light by a 
vari-temperatured atmosphere — 
not interplanetary adventurers 
poking about our volcanic mud 
ball. 

The book discusses these atmospheric tricks quietly and 
good - naturedly; photographs 
show various species of flying 
saucers, from fakes to clouds to 
variously focused lights. Not a 
spaceship in the bunch. 

Dr. Menzel points out that flying saucers are not only a 
contemporary phenomenon. He 
traces them back to their equivalents in Biblical times, and reviews the scares they caused in 
the last decades of the 19th Century. They were thought to be 
airships in those days. 

Today, people are jittery over 
the cold war. They have heard 
a lot about super -weapons. They 
know now that space travel may 
really be practical. So they jump 
to conclusions whenever reports 
of strange lights or objects are 
spread, conclusions completely 
unwarranted by the evidence at 
hand. 

We should read this book for 
positive enjoyment as well as for 
an antidote to the deep end off 
which it is so tempting to go. My 
owh personal use for it will involve braining with its edge the 
next innocent who says : "But 



don't all science-fiction writers 
believe in flying saucers?"

pages, $5.00 

REPRINTED for the first time 
since its original publication 
in 1926, this is one of the great 
fantasy - romance - adventures of 
all time. It is a modern imaginative Edda, perhaps the most 
magnificent piece of swashbuckling imagination of this century 
— a recreation of the Age of 
Chivalry in a Never-Never Land 
called Mercury. 

As the late James Stephens 
put it in his introduction to the 
original edition (here also reprinted) : "Waking or in dream, 
this author has been in strange 
regions and has supped at a torrent which only the greatest know 
of." 

The result is sheer magic that 
even tough and materialistic science fiction buffs will love.

OMNIBUS OF SCIENCE FICTION, Edited by Groff Conklin. 
Crown Publishers, New York, 
1952. 574 pages, $3.50 

THERE are 43 stories in this 
volume, two of them — "Recruiting Station" by A. E. van 
Vogt and "The Scarlet Plague" 



by Jack London — being themselves book-length short novels. 

Practically every author of science fiction note is represented, 
as well as one or two famed 
writers who are not usually 
thought of as addicted to the 
genre. Furthermore, just about 
every type of S-F story is represented. Not the least of the book's 
virtues is its demonstration of 
the scope of science fiction, which 
is as large as thought itself. 

Although none of the stories

GREW THE LASSES

THE September evening was 
hot and humid, and Helen 
Raymond, watching her 
husband pace nervously about the 
living room, grew tenser by the 
minute. Robert would walk up to 
an open window, sniff abstractedly, move to the next window, 
and repeat the performance. 

"For goodness' sakes, Robert, 
what are you snuffling about?" 
she finally demanded in exasperation. She had been on edge ever 
since her cousin Dora had arrived 
that afternoon. Dora had lost 
another of a long succession of 
short-lived jobs and, as usual, had 
descended on them without warning for an indefinite visit. Wasn't 
it enough to have to bear, that

and the heat, too. without Robert's acting up? 

"Smog's getting worse all the 
time," Robert complained. 

Dora lifted her nose to sniff 
daintily. "It is an odd smog. 

Now in New York we don't " 

Her voice trailed off and left the 
sentence hanging as she drew in 
another sample of the night air. 

Helen sniffed, too. "We look 
like a bunch of rabbits," she 
thought irritably. But Dora was 
right. It was an odd smog, sort 
of sweet and bitter at the same 
time. Not sulphuric like most of 
the smog they were used to, or 
the spoiled-onions-frying-in-rancid-fat smell of oil wells when 
the wind was off the land. This

I1BE RUTH ft LOU tEHRIS 



odor made her think of rank 
tropical weeds, a jungle miasma, 
though she had never been near 
a jungle. 

HPHERE was something familiar 
about it, though, and then she 
remembered that her hands had 
smell ed like that the morning 
after she had weeded the tiny 
garden alongside their house. The 
flowerbed had been cluttered with 
weeds of a kind she had never 
seen before, horrible - looking 
things. Could they be the cause 
of that awful smell? They had 
sprung up everywhere lately, and, 
while she had pulled them out of 
their own garden, they were growing all over, and she couldn't 
very well weed the whole town, 
could she? 

"I thjnk — wait, I want to get 
something," she said, and ran outdoors. 

She came back with a sample 
of the weed, one that she pulled 
from the garden of the vacant 
house next door. The plant was 
about a foot high, with a straight, 
stiff stem, of a bright metallic 
green, with a single row of inchwide rosettes of chartreuse leaves 
or petals down one side of the 
stem. There could be no doubt 
about its being the cause of the 
unpleasant odor, and Helen held 
it out at arm's length. 

"What the heck is that?" 
Robert asked. 



"Smell!" she said. 

"Phew! So that's it. What is 
it, anyway?" 

Helen shook her head. "Never 
saw anything like it until recently. I pulled 'em out of our 
garden, but they're all over." 

Helen carried the offending 
plant to the back door. When 
she came back, Robert peered at 
her intently, shut his eyes and 
shook his head quickly, and then 
stared at her again. 

"Think you'll know me next 
time you see me?" she asked, annoyed. 

"First good look I've had at 
you this evening. What kind of 
face powder is that you're using? 
Don't tell me that peculiar shade 
is the latest fashion?" 

Puzzled, Helen put her hand 
to her face as if she should be 
able to feel the color. 

"Mom's green!" chortled eightyear-old Bobby. "You ought to 
see yourself!" 

"Green?" Helen asked worriedly. 

"Green," Robert said. "You 
feel all right?" 

"Anemia," Dora declared positively. "You don't eat properly. 
Not enough vitamins. Now, while 
I'm here — " 

A quick look in the mirror, 
and Helen told herself that she 
wasn't really a green green, just 
sort of greenish, if you looked at 
her in the right light. By morning, 



GREEN GREW THE LASSES

the odd color ought to be all 
gone. There was no sense in 
worrying. Anybody could look 
sort of off -color now and then. 
Maybe Dora was right — she was 
anemic. 

BUT she was stunned by the 
first sight of herself in the 
mirror the next morning. There 
was no mistaking it this time. 
She was as green as grass, and 
Dora, too, was beginning to show 
signs of becoming that unbecoming color. 

Reluctantly, Dora conceded 
that it might not be the diet, after 
all. She hadn't been there long 
enough for it to have that much 
effect. 

Robert and Bobby were still 
shockingly normal. 

"What — whatever can it be?" 
Helen asked shakily, holding out 
her green hands. The only answer was hysterical screaming 
that sent them all racing to the 
front door. 

The Raymonds lived in a typical California court, with four 
small houses facing four other 
small houses across a central walk 
that ran at right angles to the 
street. On this walk most of the 
tenants were now gathered, and 
the Raymonds and Dora joined 
them. 

Helen didn't know whether to 
feel relieved or more dismayed 
when she saw that all the women 



and girls were as green as she, 
and just as terrified. 

Someone, of course, had called 
the police, and a prowl car 
hummed to a stop at the curb. A 
harrassed, white-faced policeman 
leaned out of the window. 

"We're doing all we can," he 
called. "It's like this all over 
town. Don't know yet what 
caused it, but we're investigating." 
The car sped away. 

It was soon apparent that only 
Mimosa Beach was affected. Why, 
no one could guess. Some said it 
was all a publicity stunt of some 
kind, advertising a movie or television show, or a chlorophyll 
product, perhaps, but they 
couldn't explain how it worked, 
or why only women and girls 
were affected. And how could it 
possibly help sell anything? 

Overnight, Mimosa Beach became famous, and infested with 
reporters and color photographers, all male. There would have 
been a mass exodus if there had 
been any place to go. But other 
communities, fearing that their 
womenfolk would "catch" the 
greenness, like measles, refused 
to let them in. Besides, in Mimosa 
Beach they had the dubious comfort of all being alike, while elsewhere they would have been 
freaks. 

There was so little they could 
do to make themselves look attractive. The cosmetics they had 



130 




 



or that were available were all 
wrong. But they did the best they 
could, though there was no hiding that ghastly green complexion. 

"What a shame your hair isn't 
red," Dora said one day to Helen. 
"Amy Olson, now, her hair really 
goes with green skin." Cocking her 
head to one side, she studied the 
younger woman intently. "Your 
hair — that mousy brown — wonder 
if we couldn't touch it up just a 
wee bit?" 

Helen clenched her teeth 
against the coy, criticizing voice. 
"I'm not the flamboyant type," 
she said. 

Dora was as green as Helen 
by this time, and it certainly 
wasn't a bit more becoming to 
her. She seemed to be enjoying 
the publicity, though. Besides, it 
gave her a good excuse for not 
leaving. 

If only the greenness had come 
before Dora — they might have 
been spared one calamity! 

FOUR girls moved into the 
house next to the Raymonds, 
the last house in the row. 

Neither the Raymonds nor 
Dora noticed that they had 
moved in; they came so quietly. 
The houses in the court were 
furnished and they must have 
paid the rent, obtained the keys, 
and walked in, all settled as soon 
as they closed the door behind 
them. It wasn't until they rang 



the Raymonds' doorbell in the 
early evening that anyone in the 
household was aware of them. 

"We move next door," one of 
them said brightly to Helen when 
she answered the door. "We come 
see you, get acquainted. We come 
in?" 

"Of course," Helen said, and 
they trooped in. "We're the Raymonds, and this is my cousin, 
Dora Hastings." 

The new neighbor who had 
spoken first pointed to her companions, one by one. "Patricia 
Pontiac," she said. "Clara Ford. 
Mary Maroon. Me," poking a 
thumb at her own midriff, "Jack 
Jones." 

"Jack Jones?" Helen repeated. 
"That's a man's name." 

"Man?" the girl asked blankly. 

"Man!" Robert said impatiently. "Like me." 

The four girls noticed him for 
the first time, and then they saw 
Bobby. They stared at the two 
of them, their mouths slightly 
open, their eyes wide with horror. 
They drew closer to each other, 
as if for protection, and shivered. 

Robert and Bobby looked at 
each other in bewildered embarrassment. 

"My husband and son," Helen 
said tartly. Did these odd creatures think all males were wolves, 
including eight-year-old Bobby? 

"That — that color!" Mary Maroon quavered. "Not green!" 



GREEN GREW THE LASSES 



131 



"Only dames are green," Bobby 
scornfully said. 

"Imagine!" Dora tittered nervously. "Afraid of Robert and 
Bobby !" 

"Won't you sit down?" Helen 
asked. This nonsense of being 
scared of her menfolk had gone 
on long enough. She didn't want 
them to sit down. She wanted 
them to go. But she could hardly 
ask them to do that. 

Naturally, they sat down. 

Bobby turned on the television 
for a space opera, and the four 
new neighbors watched it avidly. 
When the spaceship landed on 
what was supposed to be Venus, 
they giggled behind their hands 
and looked at each other sidewise. 
Hadn't they ever seen a show like 
that before? What was so unusually funny about this one? 

When the commercial came on, 
Robert turned off the sound. 
Mary Maroon looked at Bobby, 
and then at Helen .who was sitting 
with her arm around her son. 

"You — baby?" she asked. 

Helen smiled proudly. "Yes, 
this is my baby." 

Bobby squirmed indignantly. 

Mary Maroon then turned to 
Robert. "You got baby?" 

Robert said, "Sure, this is my 
baby," patting Bobby on the knee. 
To Helen, he muttered, "What 
does she think, anyway?" 

The four stared at Robert and 
Bobby and Helen in such obvious 



confusion that Robert jumped up 
nervously to turn the sound back 
on. 

A FTER the girls had gone 
**home, Bobby was sent off to 
bed, and Robert, loosening his 
tie, demanded, "What's the matter with them, anyhow? Do they 
have to stare at me as if I were 
a damned biological error? Don't 
they know what a man is, for 
heaven's sake?" 

"Really, Robert," Dora protested, blushing a deeper green. 

"Well, for gosh sakes — " 

"Those names!" Helen said. 
"Clara Ford, that's not too bad. 
I'm not so sure about Mary 
Maroon." 

Dora nodded. "Mary White. 
Mary Black. So why not Mary 
Maroon? But Patricia Pontiac!" 

Helen threw up her hands. 
"They must have made that one 
up. But Jack ,/ones!" 

"Crazy, if you ask me," Robert 
said, "pretending they were 
scared of me and Bobby." 

"There's a Patricia Beauty 
Shoppe next to the Pontiac 
agency," Dora suggested. "Maybe—" 

"Funny way to get a name. 
Where the heck are they from?" 
Robert wondered. 

"Must be from right here in 
town," Helen reminded him. 
"Otherwise they wouldn't be 
green." 



132 




 



"You know, the greeness looks 
sort of natural on them," Dora 
said thoughtfully. "Well, think 
I'll go to bed." 

After she had gone, Helen said 
wistfully in a whisper, "If only 
awful things could sort of counteract each other the way some 
poisons do." She started making 
up the davenport bed; Dora had 
their room. "First Dora's coming, 
and our turning green, and now 
those crazy girls right next door. 
But three poisons — no, it wouldn't 
come out even." 

IT was a day or two later when 
Helen found her new neighbors working in the little flowerbed alongside their house. They 
were busily transplanting weeds 
of the kind responsible for the 
unpleasant odor. 

"For goodness' sake!" Helen exclaimed, disgusted. "What in the 
world do you want with that 
stuff? Why, it took the rest of us 
here in the court days to get it 
all out and now you want to 
bring it back. Throw it away!" 

"Oh, no!" Patricia Pontiac objected, holding a bunch of the 
weeds against her heart protectingly. "It's faneweed!" 

"You mean you've seen the 
stuff before?" 

Patricia nodded. "We have it 
all over where we came from. 
Must have faneweed." 

"But you couldn't have come 



from some place else," Helen \ 
pointed out. "You wouldn't be 
green if you did." 

"All green where we come 
from," Mary Maroon said. 

"I don't know where that stuff 
— faneweed, you call it? — came 
from," Helen said, refusing to 
pay any attention to their claim 
that they came from some place 
else where everyone was green. 
There just wasn't any such place! 

"We drop seed other time we 
come," Patricia said. Then she 
added indignantly, "You no believe we come from other place?" 

"What other place?" asked 
Helen, with weary politeness. 

"You call it Venus." 

"That picture the other night," 
Clara Ford giggled. "Not like 
Venus at all. So funny!" 

Helen could stand no more. 
"So are you!" she said rudely, 
and went into the house. 

They were even crazier than 
she'd thought. Greener, too, when 
you saw them in broad daylight. 
Did the greenness affect the mind, 
and the greener you got, the zanier you became? Would she get to 
be like that? The idea frightened 
her. 

"No turn green?" Patricia Pontiac asked Robert plaintively one 
day, as if she were blaming him 
for her bewilderment. 

"No!" he answered shortly. 
"But I don't blame you for envying us men. It must be tough to 



GREEN GREW THE 1ASSES 



*33 



be that lousy-looking color." 

"Green is good color!" Mary 
Maroon declared stoutly. "You 
no have baby yourself?" 

"Of course not!" 

Patricia turned to Helen. "Then 
what she for?" 

"He!" Robert corrected, and 
then added sarcastically, "Papa 
works to buy baby shoes. Now, 
does that answer your question?" 

Helen sighed. There was just no 
use trying to explain anything 
to those four girls. 

¥7*AIX and winter passed. The 
dull monotony of being green 
was accented now and then by 
articles and pictures in newspapers and magazines, and by 
rumors, always proved false, that 
a remedy had been found, though 
chemists, biologists and doctors 
continued hunting for the cause 
of the catastrophe. Autopsies 
provided no clue. Women protested that the doctors were 
looking at them with a wishful 
drop-dead expression, as if the 
next autopsy might be the one 
that would supply the answer. 

The greenness was still confined 
to Mimosa Beach. Other communities kept up their quarantine. 
The four girls next door to the 
Raymonds were as zany as ever, 
and Dora Hastings stayed on, of 
necessity. 

And then the monotony was 
broken by greater calamities. 



First, there was the matter of 
Patricia Pontiac's approaching 
motherhood. While this, of course, 
made no difference as far as the 
town was concerned, Dora was 
greatly perturbed, and, ever being 
one to insist on others keeping 
within the limits of her own narrow paths, she took the girl to 
task. 

"Patricia," she insisted sternly, 
"there simply must be a man to 
blame for your condition ! You 
must marry him. Think of the 
baby ! You want him to be fatherless?" 

"Fatherless? Him ?" Patricia 
repeated, frowning in perplexity. 
"What you talking about? My 
little baby girl all mine. This man 
business I don't understand." 

"Nonsense! You're just trying 
to pretend innocence.'* 

"Oh, give it up, Dora," Helen 
urged wearily. "She doesn't know 
what you're talking about." 

Dora raised skeptical eyebrows. 
"In her condition?" 

After that, Dora went around 
with a great air of virtue condescending to help the wayward. 
It must be a burden, Helen felt, to 
have to feel superior because of 
other people's faults. Such a negative sort of superiority. 

TOURING the next few weeks, 
•"-^ Dora had plenty of chance 
to feel superior. Other unmarried 
girls and women besides Patricia 



134 



GA1AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



became pregnant and, like Patricia, they insisted no man was 
responsible. But they were not 
complacent about it the way Patricia was; to them it was an indignity they did not deserve. 

"What's this town coming to, 
anyway?" Dora demanded. 

"Partheno genetic births, maybe?" Helen ventured. "No one 
would have believed that we'd 
turn green, but we did. Honestly, 
Dora, I'm getting so I'd believe 
almost anything in this nightmare existence of ours, even that 
you were about to have a baby !" 

"That," Dora rejoined acidly, 
"is not at all likely. But are you 
trying to imply that our turning 
green could have something to do 
with these shameful births?" 

"I didn't say that, but you 
could be right." 

"Hmmph!" Dora snorted. "A 
lot of nonsense!" 

The four girls were in the Raymonds' living room one afternoon, 
a week later, talking with Helen, 
when Dora, who had been feeling 
ill and had gone to the doctor's, 
walked in. She glared at the four 
girls. 

"I'm going to have a baby," she 
accused them. 

Helen drew her breath in sharply. "Oh, no! Not you, too!" 

"Of course," Clara Ford said 
complacently. "Every one have 
babies. Except Robert and Bobby 
and the ones like them. Jack and 



Mary and I have ours before we 
leave Venus. Have only one each, 
of course." 

"But why am / like this? How 
can / have a baby this way?" 
Dora's voice was shrill with anger 
and panic. 

"How else?" Jack asked calmly. 

A little chill of horror raced 
down Helen's spine. Could these 
odd girls really be telling the 
truth? Were they from Venus, as 
they insisted ? She could just 
imagine them coming to Earth — 
on a Flying Saucer, maybe — 
listening to the radio to learn the 
language. Spying on us, but not 
learning as much as they thought 
they did. She choked off a giggle, 
an incipient hysteria, as another 
thought struck her. 

"Will / have one of those — 
those — ?" 

"You already have baby," Patricia said. "Can't see how you 
have baby before we come with 
faneweed to make you green." 

Helen and Dora stared at her. 

"You mean," Helen finally was 
able to ask, "that that weed 
caused all this? That little weed?" 

"But that is what we tell you 
all along, only you always walk 
away angry." 

A LL those scientists working so 
hard, Helen realized bitterly, 
and all the time what they were 
looking for was literally under 
their feet! How could anyone have 



GREEN GREW THE LASSES 



thought that the faneweed was 
responsible for anything but the 
bad smell they had finally become 
accustomed to? 

"Why didn't I listen to these 
girls, pay more attention to what 
they said?" Helen asked herself. 
She might have been able to prevent a lot of things that had happened. She got up from her chair 
and walked nervously about. 
Well, she couldn't change the 
past, but she could stop further 
evil from the faneweed. 

"I'll bet they don't have men 
on Venus," she said to Dora, 
"judging from the way they act. 
Then they'd have to have parthenogenetic births." 

She turned to Patricia. "Why 
did you come to Earth? And 
whv just to Mimosa Beach?" 

"We try little place, what you 
call sample, before we change 
whole world," Patricia explained. 
And then she added sadly, "So 
many of our babies die. Not 
enough people left on Venus. We 
think maybe you like to come to 
Venus with us, so we make you 
as us." 

"That was very, very wicked of 
you!" Dora said severely. 

The four Venusians shrugged 
resignedly. 

"Might as well go home," Mary 
Maroon said. "They don't like it 
our way." 

"And leave me like this?" Dora 
demanded shrilly. 



"Get rid of faneweed, be as 
before," Patricia assured her. 

"With a baby I'll have trouble 
accounting for," Dora said bitterly* "Oh, no, you don't. You 
stay right here. And, Helen, don't 
you tell anybody that it'£ the 
faneweed. Then people from 
other places won't know about 
my baby, and it won't matter 
here as long as things are the 
way they are." 

"You come with us," Clara suggested wheedlingly. "You'll like 
Venus. Venus so pretty! No work, 
all happiness!" 

"No work? No wonder the 
babies die!" Dora exclaimed. 

Helen could see the yeast of 
reform beginning to work in Dora. 
The four Venusians looked puzzled. "They do that all the time," 
Helen thought irritably. Aloud, 
she said, "Dora, of course I have 
to tell about the faneweed. There 
are others involved, you know." 

"I don't suppose," Dora interrupted, "that you girls know anything about diet. Those babies 
could probably be saved with a 
little intelligence and some hard 
work." 

WHEN the four Venusians 
left shortly thereafter for 
their home, they took along Dora 
Hastings, who had great plans for 
their planet. 

With the faneweed on Earth

Mimosa Beach returned to their 
original color. Even the parthenogenetic baby girls born as a 
result of the unfortunate experiment of the Venusians were white. 

"Well, the bad things went in 
pairs, after all," Helen said to 
Robert when everything was 
normal again. "The faneweed 
was the fourth evil, though we 
didn't know it. And when we got 
rid of the faneweed, the green


ness left. The Venusians went 
away and — and I do hope Dora's 
all right!" 

"She finally got what should 
be a lifetime job," Robert answered. He crossed his fingers 
and, looking out of a western 
window at Venus, bright against 
the darkening sky, added, "At 
least, Venus is farther away than 
New York. That ought to help."

SOLDIER BOY 




In the northland, deep, and in a 
tireai cave, by an everburning fire the 
Warrior sleeps. For this is the resting 
time, the time ot peace, and so shall it 
be tor a thousand years. And yet we 
shall summon him again, my children, 
when we are sore in need, and out ot 
the north he will come, and again and 
again, each time we call, out ot the 
dark and the cold, with the fire in his 
hands, he will come. 

— Scandinavian legend 

THROUGHOUT the night, 
thick clouds had been piling in the north ; in the 
morning, it was misty and cold. 
By eight o'clock a wet, heavy, 
snow-smelling breeze had begun 
to set in, and because the crops 
were all down and the winter 
planting done, the colonists 
brewed hot coffee and remained 
inside. The wind blew steadily, 
icily from the north. It was well 
below freezing when, some time 
after nine, an army ship landed 
in a field near the settlement. 

There was still time. There 
were some last brief moments in 
which the colonists could act and 
feel as they had always done. 
They therefore grumbled in annoyance. They wanted no soldiers 
here. The few who had convenient windows stared out with 
distaste and a mild curiosity, but 




SOLDIER BOY 



no one went out to greet them. 

After a while a rather tall, fraillooking man came out of the ship 
and stood upon the hard ground 
looking toward the village. He 
remained there, waiting stiffly, 
his face turned from the wind. 
It was a silly thing to do. He was 
obviously not coming in, either 
out of pride or just plain orneriness, 

"Well, I never," a nice lady 
said. 

"What's he just standing there 
for?" another lady said. 

And all of them thought: well, 
God knows what's in the mind 
of a soldier, and right away many 
people concluded that he must 
be drunk. The seed of peace was 
deeply planted in these people, 
in the children and the women, 
very, very deep. And because 
they had been taught, oh so carefully, to hate war they had also 
been taught, quite incidentally, to 
despise soldiers. 

The lone man kept standing in 
the freezing wind. 

T^VENTUALLY, because even 
a soldier can look small and 
cold and pathetic, Bob Rossel had 
to get up out of a nice, warm 
bed and go out in that miserable 
cold to meet him. 

The soldier saluted. Like most 
soldiers, he was not too neat and 
not too clean and the salute was 
sloppy. Although he was bigger 



than Rossel he did not seem bigger. And, because of the cold, 
there were tears gathering in the 
ends of his eyes. 

"Captain Dylan, sir." His voice 
was low and did not carry. "I 
have a message from Fleet Headquarters. Are you in charge 
here?" 

Rossel, a small sober man, 
grunted. "Nobody's in charge 
here. If you want a spokesman I 
guess I'll do. What's up?" 

The captain regarded him 
briefly out of pale blue, expressionless eyes. Then he pulled an 
envelope from an inside pocket, 
handed it to Rossel. It was a 
thick, official-looking thing and 
Rossel hefted it idly. He was 
about to ask again what was it 
all about when the airlock of the 
hovering ship swung open creakily. A beefy, black-haired young 
man appeared unsteadily in the 
doorway, called to Dylan. 

"C'n I go now, Jim?" 

Dylan turned and nodded. 

"Be back for you tonight," 
the young man called, and then, 
grinning, he yelled "Catch" and 
tossed down a bottle. The captain 
caught it and put it unconcernedly into his pocket while Rossel 
stared in disgust. A moment later 
the airlock closed and the ship 
prepared to lift. 

"Was he drunk?" Rossel began 
angrily. "Was that a bottle of 
liquor? 



140 




 



The soldier was looking at him 
calmly, coldly, He indicated the 
envelope in Rossel's hand. "You'd 
better read that and get moving. 
We haven't much time." 

He turned and walked toward 
the buildings and Rossel had to 
follow. As Rossel drew near the 
walls the watchers could see his 
lips moving but could not hear 
him. Just then the ship lifted and 
they turned to watch that, and 
followed it upward, red sparktailed, into the gray spongy 
clouds and the cold. 

After a while the ship went out 
of sight, and nobody ever saw it 
again. 

HpHE first contact Man had 
ever had with an intelligent 
alien race occurred out on the 
perimeter in a small quiet place 
a long way from home. Late in 
the year 2360 — the exact date remains unknown — an alien force 
attacked and destroyed the colony 
at Lupus V. The wreckage and 
the dead were found by a mailship which flashed off screaming 
for the army. 

When the army came it found 
this: Of the seventy registered 
colonists, thirty-one were dead. 
The rest, including some women 
and children, were missing. All 
technical equipment, all radios, 
guns, machines, even books, were 
also missing. The buildings had 
been burned, so were the bodies. 



Apparently the aliens had a heat 
ray. What else they had, nobody 
knew. After a few days of walking around in the ash, one soldier 
finally stumbled on something. 

For security reasons, there was 
a detonator in one of the main 
buildings. In case of enemy attack, Security had provided a 
bomb to be buried in the center 
of each colony, because it was 
important to blow a whole village 
to hell and gone rather than let a 
hostile alien learn vital facts 
about human technology and 
body chemistry. There was a 
bomb at Lupus V too, and though 
it had been detonated it had not 
blown. The detonating wire had 
been cut. 

In the heart of the camp, hidden from view under twelve 
inches of earth, the wire had been 
dug up and cut. 

The army could not understand 
it and had no time to try. After 
five hundred years of peace and 
anti-war conditioning the army 
was small, weak and without respect. Therefore, the army did 
nothing but spread the news, 
and Man began to fall back. 

In a thickening, hastening 
stream he came back from the 
hard-won stars, blowing up his 
homes behind him, stunned and 
cursing. Most of the colonists got 
out in time. A few, the farthest 
and loneliest, died in fire before 
the army ships could reach them.

And the men in those ships, 
drinkers and gamblers and veterans of nothing, the dregs of a 
society which had grown beyond 
them, were for a long while the 
only defense Earth had. 

This was the message Captain 
Dylan had brought, come out 
from Earth with a bottle on his 
hip. 

A N obscenely cheerful expression upon his gaunt, not too 
well shaven face, Captain Dylan 
perched himself upon the edge 
of a table and listened, one long 
booted leg swinging idly. One by 
one the colonists were beginning 
to understand. War is huge and 
comes with great suddenness and 
always without reason, and there 
is inevitably a wait, between acts, 
between the news and the motion, the fear and the rage. 

Dylan waited. These people 
were taking it well, much better 
than those in the cities had taken 
it. But then, these were pioneers. 
Dylan grinned. Pioneers. Before 
you settle a planet you boil it and 
bake it and purge it of all possible disease. Then you step 
down gingerly and inflate your 
plastic houses, which harden and 
become warm and impregnable; 
and send your machines out to 
plant and harvest; and set up 
automatic factories to transmute 
dirt into coffee ; and, without ever 
having lifted a finger, you have 



braved the wilderness, hewed a 
home out of the living rock and 
become a pioneer. Dylan grinned 
again. But at least this was better 
than the wailing of the cities. 

This Dylan thought, although 
he was himself no fighter, no man 
at all by any standards. This he 
thought because he was a soldier 
and an outcast; to every drunken 
man the fall of the sober is a 
happy thing. He stirred restlessly. 

By this time the colonists had 
begun to realize that there wasn't 
much to say, and a tall, handsome woman was murmuring 
distractedly : "Lupus, Lupus — 
doesn't that mean wolves or 
something?" 

Dylan began to wish they 
would get moving, these pioneers. 
It was very possible that the 
aliens would be here soon, and 
there was no need for discussion. 
There was only one thing to do 
and that was to clear the hell 
out, quickly and without argument. They began to see it. 

But, when the fear had died 
down, the resentment came. A 
number of women began to cluster around Dylan and complain, 
working up their anger. Dylan 
said nothing. Then the man Rossel pushed forward and confronted him, speaking with a vast 
annoyance. 

"See here, soldier, this is our 
planet. I mean to say, this is our 
home. We demand some pro


142 




 



tection from the fleet. By God, 
we've been paying the freight for 
you boys all these years and it's 
high time you earned your keep. 
We demand . . .*' 

It went on and on while Dylan 
looked at the clock and waited. 
He hoped that he could end this 
quickly. A big gloomy man was in 
front of him now and giving him 
that name of ancient contempt, 
"soldier boy." The gloomy man 
wanted to know where the fleet 
was. 

"There is no fleet. There are a 
few hundred half-shot old tubs 
that were obsolete before you 
were born. There are four or five 
new jobs for the brass and the 
government. That's all the fleet 
there is." 

TAYLAN wanted to go on about 
" that, to remind them that 
nobody had wanted the army, 
that the fleet had grown smaller 
and smaller . . . but this was not 
the time. It was ten-thirty already and the damned aliens 
might be coming in right now for 
all he knew, and all they did was 
talk. He had realized a long 
time ago that no peace-loving 
nation in the history of Earth 
had ever kept itself strong, and 
although peace was a noble 
dream, it was ended now and it 
was time to move. 

"We'd better get going," he 
finally said, and there was quiet. 



"Lieutenant Bossio has gone on 
to your sister colony at Planet 
Three of this system. He'll return 
to pick me up by nightfall and 
I'm instructed, to have you gone 
by then." 

For a long moment they waited, 
and then one man abruptly 
walked off and the rest followed 
quickly; in a moment they were 
all gone. One or two stopped long 
enough to complain about the 
fleet, and the big gloomy man 
said he wanted guns, that's all, 
and there wouldn't nobody get 
him off his planet. When he left, 
Dylan breathed with relief and 
went out to check the bomb, 
grateful for the action. 

Most of it had to be done in 
the open. He found a metal bar 
in the radio shack and began 
chopping at the frozen ground, 
following the wire. It was the first 
thing he had done with his hands 
in weeks, and it felt fine. 

Dylan had been called up out 
of a bar — he and Bossio — and 
told what had happened, and in 
three weeks now they had cleared 
four colonies. This would be the 
last, and the tension here was 
beginning to get to him. After 
thirty years of hanging around 
and playing like the town drunk, 
a man could not be expected to 
rush out and plug the breach, 
just like that. It would take time. 

He rested, sweating, took a 
pull from the bottle on his hip. 



SOLDIER BOY 



143 



Before they sent him out on 
this trip they had made him a 
captain. Well, that was nice. After 
thirty years he was a captain. 
For thirty years he had bummed 
all over the west end of space, 
had scraped his way along the 
outer edges of Mankind, had 
waited and dozed and patrolled 
and got drunk, waiting always 
for something to happen. There 
were a lot of ways to pass the 
time while you waited for something to happen, and he had done 
them all. 

Once he had even studied military tactics. 

He could not help smiling at 
that, even now. Damn it, he'd 
been green. But he'd been only 
nineteen when his father died — 
of a hernia, of a crazy fool thing 
like a hernia that killed him just 
because he'd worked too long on 
a heavy planet — and in those 
days the anti-war conditioning 
out on the Rim was not very 
strong. They talked a lot about 
guardians of the frontier, and 
they got him and some other kids 
and a broken-down doctor. And 
. . . now he was a captain. 

He bent his back savagely, 
digging at the ground. You wait 
and you wait and the edge goes 
off. This thing he had waited for 
all those damn days was upon 
him now and there was nothing 
he could do but say the hell with 
it and go home. Somewhere along 



the line, in some dark corner of 
the bars or the jails, in one of the 
million soul- murdering insults 
which are reserved especially for 
peacetime soldiers, he had lost 
the core of himself, and it didn't 
particularly matter. That was 
the point: it made no particular 
difference if he never got it back. 
He owed nobody. He was tugging 
at the wire and trying to think 
of something pleasant from the 
old days, when the wire came 
loose in his hands. 

Although he had been, in his 
cynical way, expecting it, for a 
moment it threw him and he just 
stared. The end was clean and 
bright. The wire had just been 
cut. 

1~\YLAN sat for a long while 
by the radio shack, holding 
the ends in his hands. He reached 
almost automatically for the 
bottle on his hip and then, for 
the first time he could remember, 
let it go. This was real, there 
was no time for that. 

When Rossel came up, Dylan 
was still sitting. Rossel was so 
excited he did not notice the 
wire. I 

"Listen, soldier, how many people can your ship take?" 

Dylan looked at him vaguely. 
"She sleeps two and won't take 
off with more'n ten. Why?" 

His eyes bright and worried, 
Rossel leaned heavily against the 



144 




 



shack. "We're overloaded. There 
are sixty of us and our ship will 
only take forty. We came out in 
groups, we never thought . . ." 

Dylan dropped his eyes, swearing silently. "You're sure? No 
baggage, no iron rations ; you 
couldn't get ten more on?" 

"Not a chance. She's only a 
little ship with one deck — she's 
all we could afford.'* 

Dylan whistled. He had begun 
to feel light-headed. "It 'pears 
that somebody's gonna find out 
first hand what them aliens look 
like." 

It was the wrong thing to say 
and he knew it. "All right," he 
said quickly, still staring at the 
clear-sliced wire, "we'll do what 
we can. Maybe the colony on 
Three has room. I'll call Bossio 
and ask." 

The colonist had begun to look 
quite pitifully at the buildings 
around him and the scurrying 
people. 

"Aren't there any fleet ships 
within radio distance?" 

Dylan shook his head. "The 
fleet's spread out kind of thin 
nowadays." Because the other 
was leaning on him he felt a 
great irritation, but he said, as 
kindly as he could, "We'll get 
'em all out. One way or another, 
we won't leave Anybody." 

It was then that Rossel saw the 
wire, Thickly, he asked what had 
happened. 



Dylan showed him the two 
clean ends. "Somebody dug it up, 
cut it, then buried it again and 
packed it down real nice." 

"The damn fool!" Rossel exploded. 

"Who?", 

"Why, one of ... of us, of 
course. I know nobody ever liked 
sitting on a live bomb like this, 
but I never . . ." 

"You think one of your people 
did it?" 

Rossel stared at him . " I sn ' t 
that obvious?" 
"Why?" 

"Well, they probably thought 
it was too dangerous, and silly 
too, like most government rules. 
Or maybe one of the kids . . ." 

TT was then that Dylan told 
-1 him about the wire on Lupus 
V. Rossel was silent. Involuntarily, he glanced at the sky, then 
he said shakily, "Maybe an 
animal?" 

Dylan shook his head. "No 
animal did that. Wouldn't have 
buried it, or found it in the first 
place. Heck of a coincidence, 
don't you think? The wire at 
Lupus was cut just before an 
alien attack, and now this one 
is cut too — newly cut." 

The colonist put one hand to 
his mouth, his eyes wide and 
white. 

"So something," said Dylan, 
"knew enough about this camp to 



SOLDIER BOY 



!45 



know that a bomb, was buried 
here and also to know why it 
was here. And that something 
didn't want the camp destroyed 
and so came right into the center 
of the camp, traced the wire, dug 
it up and cut it. And then walked 
right out again." 

"Listen," said Rossel, "I'd better go ask." 

He started away but Dylan 
caught his arm. 

"Tell them to arm," he said, 
"and try not to scare hell out of 
them. I'll be with you as soon 
as I've spliced this wire." 

Rossel nodded and went off, 
running. Dylan knelt with the 
metal in his hands. 

He began to feel that, by God, 
he was getting cold. He realized 
that he'd better go inside soon, 
but the wire had to be spliced. 
That was perhaps the most important thing he could do now, 
splice the wire. 

All right, he asked himself for 
the thousandth time, who cut it? 
How? Telepathy? Could they 
somehow control one of us? 

No. If they controlled one, 
then they could control all, and 
then there would be no need for 
an attack. But you don't know, 
you don't really know. 

Were they small? Little animals? 

Unlikely. Biology said that 
really intelligent life required a 
sizable bra in and you would 



have to expect an alien to be at 
least as large as a dog. And 
every form of life on this planet 
had been screened long before a 
colony had been allowed in. If 
any new animals had suddenly 
shown up, Rossel would certainly 
know about it. 

He would ask Rossel. He 
would damn sure have to ask 
Rossel. 

He finished splicing the wire 
and tucked it into the ground. 
Then he straightened up and, 
before he went into the radio 
shack, he pulled out his pistol. 
He checked it, primed it, and 
tried to remember the last time 
he had fired it. He never had — 
he never had fired a gun. 

'T^HE snow began falling near 
noon. There was nothing anybody could do but stand in the 
silence and watch it come down 
in a white rushing wall, and 
watch the trees and the hills 
drown in the whiteness, until 
there was nothing on the planet 
but the buildings and a few warm 
lights and the snow. 

By one o'clock the visibility 
was down to zero and Dylan 
decided to try to contact Bossio 
again and tell him to hurry. But 
Bossio still didn't answer. Dylan 
stared long and thoughtfully out 
the window through the snow at 
the gray shrouded shapes of 
bushes and trees which were be


146 




 



ginning to become horrifying. It 
must be that Bossio was still 
drunk — maybe sleeping it off before making planetfall on Three. 
Dylan held no grudge. Bossio 
was a kid and alone. It took a 
special kind of guts to take a 
ship out into space alone, when 
Things could be waiting . . . 

A young girl, pink and lovely 
in a thick fur jacket, came into 
the shack and told him breathlessly that her father, Mr. Rush, 
would like to know if he wanted 
sentries posted. Dylan hadn't 
thought about it but he said yes 
right away, beginning to feel both 
pleased and irritated at the same 
time, because now they were 
coming to him. 

He pushed out into the cold 
and went to find Rossel. With the 
snow it was bad enough, but if 
they were still here when the sun 
went down they wouldn't have a 
chance. Most of the men were out 
stripping down their ship and 
that would take a while. He 
wondered why Rossel hadn't yet 
put a call through to Three, asking about room on the ship 
there. The only answer he could 
find was that Rossel knew that 
there was no room, and he wanted 
to put off the answer as long as 
possible. And, in a way, you 
could not blame him. 

Rossel was in his cabin with 
the big, gloomy man — who 
turned out to be Rush, the one 



who had asked about sentries. 
Rush was methodically cleaning 
an old hunting rifle. Rossel was 
surprisingly full of hope. 

"Listen, there's a mail ship 
due in, been due since yesterday. 
We might get the rest of the 
folks out on that." 

Dylan shrugged. "Don't count 
on it." 

"But they have a contract!" 

The soldier grinned. 

The big man, Rush, was paying 
no attention. Quite suddenly he 
said: "Who cut that wire, Cap?" 

TAYLAN swung slowly to look 
at him. "As far as I can 
figure, an alien cut it." 

Rush shook his head. "No. 
Ain't been no aliens near this 
camp, and no peculiar animals 
either. We got a planet-wide 
radar, and ain't no unidentified 
ships come near, not since we 
first landed more'n a year ago." 
He lifted the rifle and peered 
through the bore. "Uh-uh. One 
of us did it." 

The man had been thinking. 
And he knew the planet. 

"Telepathy?" asked Dylan. 

"Might be." 

"Can't see it. You people live 
too close, you'd notice right away 
if one of you wasn't . . . himself. 
And, if they've got one, why not 
all?" 

Rush calmly — at least outwardly calmly — lit his pipe. 



SOLDIER BOY 



147 



There was a strength in this man 
that Dylan had missed before. 

"Don't know," he said gruffly. 
"But these are aliens, mister. 
And until I know different I'm 
keepin' an eye on my neighbor." 

He gave Rossel a sour look and 
Rossel stared back, uncomprehending. 

Then Rossel jumped. "My 
God!" 

Dylan moved to quiet him. 
"Look, is there any animal at 
all that ever comes near here 
that's as large as a dog?" 

After a pause, Rush answered. 
"Yep, there's one. The viggle. 
It's like a reg'lar monkey but 
with four legs. Biology cleared 
'em before we landed. We shoot 
one now and then when they get 
pesky." He rose slowly, the rifle 
held under his arm. "I b'lieve 
we might just as well go post 
them sentries." 

Dylan wanted to go on with 
this but there was nothing much 
else to say. Rossel went with them 
as far as the radio shack, with 
a strained expression on his face, 
to put through that call to Three. 

When he was gone Rush asked 
Dylan, "Where you want them 
sentries? I got Walt Halloran and 
Web Eggers and six others lined 
up." 

Dylan stopped and looked 
around grimly at the circling 
wall of snow. "You know the 
site better than I do. Post 'em in 



a ring, on rises, within calling 
distance. Have 'em check with 
each other every five minutes. I'll 
go help your people at the ship." 

The gloomy man nodded and 
fluffed up his collar. "Nice day 
for huntin'," he said, and then 
he was gone with the snow quickly covering his footprints. 

HpHE Alien lay wrapped in a 
-■■ thick electric cocoon, buried 
in a wide warm room beneath 
the base of a tree. The tree 
served him as antennae; curiously he gazed into a small viewscreen and watched the humans 
come. He saw them fan out, eight 
of them, and sink down in the 
snow. He saw that they were 
armed. 

He pulsed thoughtfully, extending a part of himself to absorb 
a spiced lizard. Since the morning, when the new ship had come, 
he had been watching steadily, 
and now it was apparent that the 
humans were aware of their danger. Undoubtedly they were preparing to leave. 

That was unfortunate. The attack was not scheduled until late 
that night and he could not, 
of course, press the assault by 
day. But flexibility, he reminded 
himself sternly, is the first principle of absorption, and therefore he moved to alter his plans. 
A projection reached out to dial 
several knobs on a large box be


148

149 



fore him, and the hour of assault was moved forward to dusk. 
A glance at the chronometer told 
him that it was already well into 
the night on Planet Three, and 
that the attack there had probably begun. 

The Alien felt the first tenuous 
pulsing of anticipation. He lay 
quietly, watching the small square 
lights of windows against the 
snow, thanking the Unexplainable that matters had been so 
devised that he would not have 
to venture out into that miserable 
cold. 

Presently an alarming thought 
struck him. These humans moved 
with uncommon speed for intelligent creatures. Even without devices, it was distinctly possible 
that they could be gone before 
nightfall. He could take no 
chance, of course. He spun more 
dials and pressed a single button, 
and lay back again comfortably, 
warmly, to watch the disabling 
of the colonists' ship. 

TfTHEN Three did not answer, 
™ Rossel was nervously gazing at the snow, thinking of other 
things, and he called again. Several moments later the realization 
of what was happening struck 
him like a blow. Three had never 
once failed to answer. All they 
had to do when they heard the 
signal buzz was go into the radio 
shack and say hello. That was 



all they had to do. He called 
again and again, but nobody answered. There was no static and 
no interference and he didn't hear 
a thing. He checked frenziedly 
through his own apparatus and 
tried again, but the air was as 
dead as deep space. He raced out 
to tell Dylan. 

Dylan accepted it. He had 
known none of the people on 
Three and what he felt now was 
a much greater urgency to be 
out of here. He said hopeful 
things to Rossel, and then went 
out to the ship and joined the 
men in lightening her. About 
the ship at least, he knew something and he was able to tell 
them what partitions and frames 
could go and what would have to 
stay or the ship would never get 
off the planet. But even stripped 
down, it couldn't take them all. 
When he knew that, he realized 
that he himself would have to 
stay here, for it was only then 
that he thought of Bossio. 

Three was dead. Bossio had 
gone down there some time ago 
and, if Three was dead and 
Bossio had not called, then the 
fact was that Bossio was gone 
too. For a long, long moment 
Dylan stood rooted in the snow. 
More than the fact that he would 
have to stay here was the unspoken, unalterable, heart-numbing knowledge that Bossio was 
dead — the one thing that Dylan 



ISO 




 



could not accept. Bossio was the 
only friend he had. In all this 
dog-eared, aimless, ape-run Universe Bossio was all his friendship and his trust. 

He left the ship blindly and 
went back to the settlement. Now 
the people were quiet and really 
frightened, and some of the 
women were beginning to cry. 
He noticed now that they had begun to look at him with hope as 
he passed, and in his own grief, 
humanly, he swore. 

Bossio — a big-grinning kid with 
no parents, no enemies, no 
grudges — Bossio was already 
dead because he had come out 
here and tried to help these people. People who had kicked or 
ignored him all the days of his 
life. And, in a short while, Dylan 
would also stay behind and die 
to save the life of somebody he 
never knew and who, twenty-four 
hours earlier, would have been 
ashamed to be found in his company. Now, when it was far, far 
too late, they were coming to the 
army for help. 

¥>UT in the end, damn it, he 
could not hate these people. 
All they had ever wanted was 
peace, and even though they had 
never understood that the Universe is unknowable and that you 
must always have big shoulders, 
still they had always sought only 
for peace. If peace leads to no 



conflict at all and then decay, 
well, that was something that 
had to be learned. So he could 
not hate these people. 

But he could not help them 
either. He turned from their eyes 
and went into the radio shack. It 
had begun to dawn on the women 
that they might be leaving without, their husbands or sons, and 
he did not want to see the fierce 
struggle that he was sure would 
take place. He sat alone and tried, 
for the last time, to call Bossio. 

After a while, an old woman 
found him and offered him coffee. 
It was a very decent thing to do, 
to think of him at a time like 
this, and he was so suddenly 
grateful he could only nod. The 
woman said that he must be cold 
in that thin army thing and that 
she had brought along a mackmaw for him. She poured the 
coffee and left him alone. 

They were thinking of him 
now, he knew, because they were 
thinking of everyone who had to 
stay. Throw the dog a bone. 
Dammit, don't be like that, he 
told himself. He had not had 
anything to eat all day and the 
coffee was warm and strong. He 
decided he might be of some help 
at the ship. 

It was stripped down now and 
they were loading. He was 
startled to see a great group of 
them standing in the snow, removing their clothes. Then he 



SOLDIER BOY 



151 



understood. The clothes of forty 
people would change the weight 
by enough to get a few more 
aboard. There was no righting. 
Some of the women were almost 
hysterical and a few had refused 
to go and were still in their 
cabins, but the process was orderly. Children went automatically, 
as did the youngest husbands 
and all the women. The elders 
were shuffling around in the 
snow, waving their arms to keep 
themselves warm. Some of them 
were laughing to keep their 
spirits up. 

In the end, the ship took fortysix people. 

Rossel was one of the ones 
that would not be going. Dylan 
saw him standing by the airlock 
holding his wife in his arms, his 
face buried in her soft brown 
hair. A sense of great sympathy, 
totally unexpected, rose up in 
Dylan, and a little of the lostness 
of thirty years went .slipping 
away. These were his people. It 
was a thing he had never understood before, because he had 
never once been among men in 
great trouble. He waited and 
watched, learning, trying to digest this while there was still 
time. Then the semi-naked colonists were inside and the airlock 
closed. But when the ship tried 
to lift, there was a sharp burning 
smell — she couldn't get off the 
ground. 



RUSH was sitting hunched 
over in the snow, his rifle 
across his knees. He was coated 
a thick white and if he hadn't 
spoken Dylan would have stumbled over him. Dylan took out 
his pistol and sat down. 

"What happened?" Rush asked. 
"Lining burned out. She's being 
repaired." 

"Coincidence?" 
Dylan shook his head. 
"How long'll it take to fix?" 
"Four — five hours.'* 
"It'll be night by then." Rush 
paused. "I wonder." 

"Seems like they want to wait 
'til dark." 

"That's what I was figurin'. 
Could be they ain't got much of 
a force." 

Dylan shrugged. "Also could 
mean they see better at night. 
Also could mean they move slow. 
Also could mean they want the 
least number of casualties." 

Rush was quiet and the snow 
fell softly on his face, on his 
eyebrows, where it had begun to 
gather. At length he said, "You 
got any idea how they got to 
the ship?" 

Dylan shook his head again. 
"Nobody saw anything — but they 
were all pretty busy. Your 
theory about it maybe being one 
of us is beginning to look pretty 
good." 

The colonist took off his gloves, 
lit a cigarette. The flame was 



152 




 



strong and piercing and Dylan 
moved to check him, but stopped. 
It didn't make much difference. 
The aliens knew where they were. 

And this is right where we're 
gonna be, he thought. 

"You know," he said suddenly, 
speaking mostly to himself, "I 
been in the army thirty years, 
and this is the first time I was 
ever in a fight. Once in a while 
we used to chase smugglers — 
never caught any, their ships 
were new — used to cut out after 
unlicensed ships, used to do all 
kinds of piddling things like that. 
But I never shot at anybody." 

Rush was looking off into the 
woods. "Maybe the mail ship 
will come in." 

Dylan nodded. 

"They got a franchise, dammit. They got to deliver as long 
as they's a colony here." 

When Dylan didn't answer, he 
said almost appealingly: "Some 
of those guys would walk barefoot through hell for a buck." 

"Maybe," Dylan said. After all, 
why not let him hope? There 
were four long hours left. 

"IVTOW he began to look down 
-L^ into himself, curiously, because he himself was utterly without hope and yet he was no 
longer really afraid. It was a surprising thing when you looked at 
it coldly, and he guessed that, 
after all, it was because of the 



thirty years. A part of him had 
waited for this. Some crazy part 
of him was ready — even after all 
this time — even excited about being in a fight. Well, what the hell, 
he marveled. And then he realized 
that the rest of him was awakening too, and he saw that this job 
was really his . . . that he had 
always been, in truth, a soldier. 

Dylan sat, finding himself, in 
the snow. Once long ago he had 
read about some fool who didn't 
want to die in bed, old and feeble. 
This character wanted to reach 
the height of his powers and then 
explode in a grand way — "in 
Technicolor," the man had said. 
Explode in Technicolor. It was 
meant to be funny, of course, but 
he had always remembered it, 
and he realized now that that 
was a small part of what he was 
feeling. The rest of it was that he 
was a soldier. 

Barbarian, said a small voice, 
primitive. But he couldn't listen. 

"Say, Cap," Rush was saying, 
"it's getting a mite chilly. I understand you got a bottle." 

"Sure," he said cheerfully, 
"near forgot it." He pulled it out 
and gave it to Rush. The colonist 
broke the seal and drank, saying 
to Dylan half -seriously, halfhumorously: "One for the road." 

Beneath them the planet revolved and the night came on. 
They waited, speaking briefly, 
while the unseen sun went down. 



SOLDIER BOY 



153 



And faintly, dimly through the 
snow, they heard at last the muffled beating of a ship. It passed 
overhead and they were sighting 
their guns before they recognized 
it. It was the mailship. 

They listened while she settled 
in a field by the camp, and Rush 
was pounding Dylan's arm. "She 
will take us all," Rush was shouting, "she'll take us all," and Dylan too was grinning, and then he 
saw a thing. 

SMALL and shadowy, whitecoated and almost invisible, 
the thing had come out of the 
woods and was moving toward 



them, bobbing and shuffling in 
the silent snow. 

Dylan fired instinctively, because the thing had four arms 
and was coming right at him. He 
fired again. This time he hit it 
and the thing fell, but almost immediately it was up and lurching 
rapidly back into the trees. It 
was gone before Dylan could fire 
again. 

They both lay flat in the snow, 
half-buried. From the camp there 
were now no sounds at all. For 
the first time today Dylan could 
hear the snow fall. 

"Did you get a good look?" 

Rush grunted, relaxing. 





 



"Should've saved your fire, son. 
Looked like one o' them monkeys." 

But there was something wrong. 
There was something that Dylan 
had heard in the quickness of the 
moment which he could not remember but which was very 
wrong. 

"Listen," he said, suddenly 
placing it. "Dammit, that was no 
monkey." 

"Easy — " 

"I hit it. I hit it cold. It made 
a noise." 

Rush was staring at him. 

"Didn't you hear?" Dylan 
cried. 

"No. Your gun was by my ear." 

And then Dylan was up and 
running, hunched over, across 
the snow to where the thing had 
fallen. He had seen a piece of it 
break off when the bolt struck, 
and now in the snow he_ picked 
up a paw and brought it back to 
Rush. He saw right away there 
was no blood. The skin was real 
and furry all right but there was 
no blood. Because the bone was 
steel and the muscles were 
springs and the thing had been 
a robot. 

T^HE Alien rose up from his 
cot, whistling with annoyance. 
When that ship had come in, his 
attention had been distracted 
from one of the robots, and of 
course the miserable thing had 




gone blundering right out into 
the humans. He thought for a 
while that the humans would 
overlook it — the seeing was poor 
and they undoubtedly would still 
think of it as animal, even with 
its firing ports open — but then he 
checked the robot and saw that 
a piece was missing and knew 
that the humans had found it. 
Well, he thought unhappily, 
flowing into his suit, no chance 
now to disable that other ship. 
The humans would never let another animal near. 

And therefore — for he was, 
above all, a flexible being — he 
would proceed to another plan. 
The settlement would have to be 
detonated. And for that he would 
have to leave his own shelter 
and go out in that miserable cold 
and Ue down in one of his bunkers which was much farther away. 



SOLDIER BOY 



155 



No need to risk blowing himself 
up with his own bombs, but still, 
that awful cold. 

He dismissed his regrets and 
buckled his suit into place. It 
carried him up the stairs and 
bore him out into the snow. After 
one whiff of the cold, he snapped 
his viewplate shut and immediately, as he had expected, it began to film with snow. Well, no 
matter, he would guide the unit 
by coordinates and it would find 
the bunker itself. No need for 
caution now. The plan was nearly ended. 

In spite of his recent setback, 
the Alien lay back and allowed 
himself the satisfaction of a full 
tremble. The plan had worked 
very nearly to perfection, as of 
course it should, and he delighted 
in the contemplation of it. 

WHEN the humans were first 
detected, in the region of 
Bootes, much thought had gone 
into the proper method of learning their technology without being discovered themselves. There 
was little purpose in destroying 
the humans without first learning from them. Life was really a 
remarkable thing — one never 
knew what critical secrets a starborne race possessed. Hence the 
robots. And it was an extraordinary plan, an elegant plan. The 
Alien trembled again. 

The humans were moving out


ward toward the Rim, their base 
was apparently somewhere beyond Centaurus. Therefore, a 
ring of defense was thrown up on 
most of the habitable worlds toward which the humans were 
coming — oh, a delightful plan — 
and the humans came down one 
by one and never realized that 
there was any defense at all. 

With a cleverness which was 
almost excruciating, the Aliens 
had carefully selected a number 
of animals native to each world, 
and then constructed robot duplicates. So simple then to place 
the robots down on a world with 
a single Director, then wait . . . 
for the humans to inhabit. Naturally the humans screened all 
the animals and scouted a planet 
pretty thoroughly before they set 
up a colony. Naturally their 
snares and their hunters caught 
no robots, and never found the 
deep-buried Alien Director. 

Then the humans relaxed and 
began to make homes, never realizing that in among the animals 
which gamboled playfully in the 
trees there was one which did not 
gambol, but watched. Never once 
noticing the monkey-like animals 
or the small thing like a rabbit 
which was a camera eye, or the 
thing like a rat which took chemical samples, or the thing like a 
lizard which cut wires. 

The Alien rumbled on through 
the snow, trembling so much now 



156 




 



with ecstasy and anticipation that 
the suit which bore him almost 
lost its balance. He very nearly 
fell over before he stopped trembling, and then he contained himself. In a little while, a very little 
while, there would be time 
enough for trembling, 

"rriHEY could've been here 'til 
the sun went out," Rush said, 
"and we never would've known." 

"I wonder how much they've 
found out," Dylan said. 

Rush was holding the paw. 

"Pretty ne a r e verythi ng , I 
guess. This stuff don't stop at 
monkeys. Could be any size, any 
kind . . . look, let's get down into 
camp and tell 'em.'* 

Dylan rose slowly>to a kneeling 
position, peering dazedly out into 
the far white trees. His mind was 
turning over and over, around 
and around, like a roulette wheel. 
But, at the center of his mind, 
there was one thought, and it 
was rising up slowly now, through 
the waste and waiting of the 
years. He felt a vague surprise. 

"Gettin' kind of dark," he said. 

Rush swore. "Let's go. Let's 
get out of here." He tugged once 
at Dylan's arm and started off on 
his knees. 

Dylan said: "Wait." 

Rush stopped. Through the 
snow he tried to see Dylan's eyes. 
The soldier was still looking into 
the woods. 



Dylan's voice was halting and 
almost inaudible. "They know 
everything about us. We don't 
know anything about them. 
They're probably sittin' out there 
right now, a swarm of 'em there 
behind those trees, waitin' for it 
to get real nice and dark." 

He paused. "If I could get just 
one." 

It was totally unexpected, to 
Dylan as well as Rush. The time 
for this sort of thing was past, 
the age was done, and for a long 
while neither of them fully understood. 

"C'mon," Rush said with exasperation. 

Dylan shook his head, marveling at himself. "I'll be with you 
in a little while." 

Rush came near and looked 
questioningly into his face. 

"Listen," Dylan said hurriedly, 
"we only need one. If we could 
just get one back to a lab we'd 
at least have some clue to what 
they are. This way we don't 
know anything. We can't just 
cut and run." He struggled with 
the unfamiliar, time-lost words. 
"We got to make a stand." 

TIE turned from Rush and lay 
forward on his belly in the 
snow. He could feel his heart 
beating against the soft white 
cushion beneath him. There was 
no time to look at this calmly 
and he was glad of that. He spent 



SOLDIER BOY 



157 



some time being very much afraid 
of the unknown things beyond 
the trees, but even then he realized that this was the one thing 
in his life he had to do. 

It is not a matter of dying, he 
thought, but of doing. Sooner or 
later a man must do a thing 
which justifies his life, or the life 
is not worth living. The long cold 
line of his existence had reached 
this point, here and now in the 
snow at this moment. He would 
go on from here as a man ... or 
not at all. 

Rush had sat down beside him, 
beginning to understand, watching without words. He was an 
old man. Like all Earthmen, he 
had never fought with his hands. 
He had not fought the land, or 
the tides, or the weather, or any 
of the million bitter sicknesses 
which Man had grown up fighting, and he was beginning to 
realize that somewhere along the 
line he had been betrayed. Now, 
with a dead paw of the enemy in 
his hand, he did not feel like a 
man. And he was ready to fight 
now, but it was much too late 
and he saw with a vast leaden 
shame that he did not know how, 
could not even begin. 

"Can I help?" he said. 

Dylan shook his head. "Go 
back and let them know about 
the robots, and, if the ship is 
ready to leave before I get back, 
well — then good luck." 



He started to slither forward 
on his belly but Rush reached out 
and grabbed him, holding with 
one hand to peace and gentleness 
and the soft days which were 
ending. 

"Listen," he said, "you don't 
owe anybody." 

Dylan stared at him with surprise. "I know," he said, and 
then he slipped up over the 
mound before him and headed 
for the trees. 

NOW what he needed was luck. 
Just good, plain old luck. 
He didn't know where they were 
or how many there were or what 
kinds there were, and the chances 
were good that one of them was 
watching him right now. Well, 
then he needed some luck. He 
inched forward slowly, carefully, 
watching the oncoming line of 
trees. The snow was falling on 
him in big, leafy flakes and that 
was fine, because the blackness 
of his suit was much too distinct 
and the more white he was the 
better. Even so, it was becoming 
quite dark by now and he thought 
he had a chance. He reached the 
first tree. 

Silently he slipped off his 
heavy cap. The visor got in his 
way and above all he must be 
able to see. He let the snow 
thicken on his hair before he 
raised himself on his elbows and 
looked outward. 



158 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



There was nothing but the 
snow and the dead quiet and the 
stark white boles of the trees. He 
slid past the first trunk to the 
next, moving forward on his elbows with his pistol in his right 
hand. His elbow struck a rock 
and it hurt and his face was 
freezing. Once he rubbed snow 
from his eyebrows. Then he came 
through the trees and lay down 
before a slight rise, thinking. 

Better to go around than over. 
But if anything is watching, it 
is most likely watching from 
above. 

Therefore, go around and come 
back up from behind. Yes. 

His nose had begun to run. 
With great care he crawled among 
some large rocks, hoping against 
hope that he would not sneeze. 
Why had nothing seen him? Was 
something following him now? 
He turned to look behind him 
but it was darker now and becoming difficult to see. But he 
would have to look behind him 
more often. 

He was moving down a gorge. 
There were large trees above him 
and he needed their shelter, but 
he could not risk slipping down 
the sides of the gorge. And far 
off, weakly, out of the gray cold 
ahead, he heard a noiseHe lay face down in the snow, 
listening. With a slow, thick shuffle, a thing was moving through 
the trees before him. In a mo


ment he saw that it was not 
coming toward him. He lifted 
his head but saw nothing. Much 
more slowly now, he crawled 
again. The thing was moving 
down the left side of the gorge 
ahead, coming away from the 
rise he had circled. It was moving without caution and he worried that if he did not hurry, he 
would lose it. But for the life of 
him he couldn't stand up. 

T^HE soldier went forward on 
his hands and knees. When 
his clothes hung down, the freezing cold entered his throat and 
shocked his body, which was 
sweating. He shifted his gun to 
his gloved hand and blew on the 
bare fingers of his right, still 
crawling. When he reached the 
other end of the gorge, he stood 
upright against a rock wall and 
looked in the direction of the 
shuffling thing. 

He saw it just as it turned. It 
was a great black lump on a 
platform. The platform had legs 
and the thing was plodding methodically upon a path which 
would bring it past him. It had 
come down from the rise and was 
rounding the gorge when Dylan 
saw it. It did not see him. 

If he had not ducked quickly 
and brought up his gun, the 
monkey would not have seen him 
either, but there was no time for 
regret. The monkey was several 



SOLDIER BOY 



yards to the right of the lump on 
the platform when he heard it 
start running, and he had to 
look up this time and saw it 
leaping toward him over the 
snow. 

All right, he said to himself. 
His first shot took the monkey 
in the head, where the eyes were. 
As the thing crashed over, there 
was a hiss and a stench, and 
flame seared into his shoulder and 
the side of his face. He lurched to 
the side, trying to see, his gun at 
arm's-length as the lump on the 
pi at form spun toward him. He 
fired four times. Three bolts went 
home in the lump, the fourth 
tore a leg off the platform and 
the whole thing fell over. 

Dylan crawled painfully behind a rock, his left arm useless. 
The silence had come back again 
and he waited, but neither of the 
alien things moved. Nothing else 
moved in the woods around him. 
He turned his face up to the falling snow and let it come soothingly upon the awful wound in 
his side. 

After a while he looked out at 
the monkey. It had risen to a 
sitting position but was frozen 
in the motion of rising. It had 
ceased to function when he hit 
the lump. Out of the numbness 
and the pain, he felt a great gladness rising. 

The guide. He had killed the 
guide. 



HE would not be cautious any 
more. Maybe some of the 
other robots were self- directing 
and dangerous, but they could 
be handled. He went to tne lump, 
stared at it without feeling. A 
black doughy bulge was swelling 
out through one of the holes. 

It was too big to carry, but he 
would have to take something 
back. He went over and took 
the monkey by a stiff jutting arm 
and began dragging it back toward the village. 

Now he began to stumble. It 
was dark and he was very tired. 
But the steel he had been forging 
in his breast was complete, and 
the days which were coming 
would be days full of living. He 
would walk with big shoulders 
and he would not bother to question, because Man was not born 
to live out his days at home, by 
the fire. 

It was a very big thing that 
Dylan had learned and he could 
not express it, but he knew it all 
the same, knew it beyond understanding. And so he went home 
to his people. 

One by one, increasing, in the 
wee black corner of space which 
Man had taken for his own, other 
men were learning. And the snow 
fell and the planets whirled, and, 
when it was spring where Dylan 
had fought, men were already 
leaping back out to the stars.

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



What Strange Powers 
Did The Ancients Possess? 



CJVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old- A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, aceumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of Wo of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about tbe laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak* 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example; The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in fife. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of
