MARS CHILD BY CYRIL JUDD 

"SUNNY!" Polly ran to 
the table where Sunny 
still lay crying, wrapped 
in his blanket again, hungry, angry, and perf ectly safe. * 'Doctor, 
what did you — how can he — ?" 

"He's £ne,*' Tony assured her. 
"Just leave him alone. He's hungry, that's all." 

Polly stared, fascinated by the 
naked-looking baby. "How can he 
breathe without a mask?*' 

"I don't know," Tony said 
bluntly, "but I tried it and it 
worked. I guess he's got naturally 
Marsworthy lungs. Seems to have 
been the only trouble he had.*' 

"You mean — I thought Marsworthy lungs just meant you could 
breathe Mars air; people like that 
can breathe Earth air, too, can't 
they?" 

Tony shrugged helplessly. He 
was licked and didn't care who 
knew it as long as Sunny was all 
right. For the time 'being, it was 
enough to know that the baby had 
ibeen breathing through his mouth 
all along just because he did prefer Mars air. He got too , much 
oxygen through the mask, so he 
didn't use his nose; a simple reversal of the theory on which the 
mask was based. When his source 
of Mars air was blocked — first by 
his mother's breast, and then, 
when he had learned to adapt to 
that, by the less flexible plastic 
nipple — he had to breathe the 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOM 



richer air through his nose, and 
he turned red, coughed, sputtered, 
and choked. 

"I want to take him back now," 
said the doctor, "and try another 
feechng. Bet he'll eat right away." 
He picked up the baby, firmly refusing to surrender him to his 
mother, and led the way out of 
the hospital room and back to the 
Kandros' house. 

Just before they left, Tony heard 
for the first time, consciously, the 
steady clicking of Graham's typewriter in the other part of the 
house. He realized it had been going almost continuously, and 
thought briefly of going inside to 
say hello, then decided against it. 
I'll see him later on, he thought 
... 7 CM explain everything then. 
Obviously, the writer understood 
that an emergency was in progress, 
or else he was so busy himself that 
he didn't want to be bothered, 
either. 

B 

JIM was thunderstruck by his 
maskless Sunny. Anna seemed 
to have recovered from her faint. 
She was a little pale, but otherwise 
normal, moving about briskly, picking up scattered blankets and ba*by 
equipment. 

"I tried to make her rest," Jim 
explained, "but she said she felt 
fine." 

"You take it easy, Anna," the 
doctor told her. "And I want to 



talk to you later — as soon as I'm 
finished with the baby." 

"I'm perfectly all right," she in- ' 
sisted. "I can't imagine what made 
me do anything so foolish. I'm 
awfully sorry . . ." 

"Polly, I want you to go to bed 
right away. You've had enough tonight — this morning, rather. Jim, 
you can handle the baby, can't 
you ? You want to change him and 
get him ready for his feeding?" 

Jim stooped over his son at the 
wall bunk, his big hands fumbling 
a little with closures on the small 
garments. Tony sat down and 
leaned back, closing his eyes. The 
baby screamed steadily, demanding 
nourishment. 

"Doc, I still don't get it. How 
did you figure it out?" 

Patiently, without opening his 
eyes, Tony repeated his explanation 
for Jim. 

"I'll take your word for it," the 
man said finally, "but I'll be 
darned if I can understand it. Okay, 
Doc, I guess he's all fixed up." 

Tony stood up. "Do you know 
how to fix a bottle? I'll show you." 

"Here." Anna was at his elbow. 
"I thought you might want one," 
she said, as though apologizing, 
and handed it over. 

"Thanks." Tony dashed a drop 
on his wrist — temperature just 
right — and passed it to Jim. "Let's 
try." 

The big man, looking absurdly 
cautious, put the bottle to Sunny's 
moutth. Then he looked up, a tre

mendous grin on his face and his 
eyes a little wet. "How do you like 
that?" he said softly. The little 
mouth and jaw were working away 
busily; Sunny was feeding as 
though he'd been doing it for 
months. 

They watched while he took a 
whole three and a half ounces, 
and then fell asleep, breathing 
quietly and regularly. 

"A Mars child," said Anna gently, looking down at Sunny. "Jim, 
you have a real Mars child." 

"Looks that way," said Kandro, 

beaming. 

"Jim," said the doctor, "somebody ought to stay up and keep an 
eye on Sunny tonight, but I'm beat. 
And Polly's got to get some sleep. 
Will you do it?" 

"Sure, Doc," said the father, not 
taking his happy eyes off the child. 

"He'll probably need another 
feeding during the night. You 
know how to sterilize the bottle, 
and there's enough formula made 
"P" 

. "Sure," said Jim, "You take care 
of Anna." 

'Til do that." 

"Oh, Tony, I'm all right, I told 
you that — " 

"'You get your parka, Anna, and 
don't argue with the doctor," Tony 
told her. "I'm going to take you 
home and sec if I can find out 
what made you pull chat swoon. 
Come on . . . If you need me for 
anything, Jim, I'll be at Anna's or 
at home." 



*<T IDO have a headache," sheX admitted when they readied 
her house. "Probably all I need h 
a little sleep. I haven't been living 
right." She tried a smile, but it 
didn't come off. 

"None of us have," Tony reminded her. He studied her and 
decided against aspirin. He selected a strong sedative and shot it 
into her arm. Within a minute, she 
relaxed in a chair and exhaled long 
and gratefully. "Better," she said. 

"Feel like talking?" 

"I — I think I ought to sleep." 

' 'Then j ust give me the bare 
facts." He ran his fingers over her 
head. "No blows. Was it a hangover?" 

"Yes," she said defiantly. 

"Very depraved. From the one 
drink you had with us?" 

"From — 'from — Oh, hell!" That 
came from the heart, for Anna 
never swore. 

"I've had enough mysteries for 
one night, Anna. Talk." 

"Maybe I ought to," she said 
unwillingly. "Only a fool tells a 
lie to his doctor or the truth to his 
lawyer, and so on." She hesitated. 
"I've got a trick mind. All those 
people who think they're psychic — 
they are. I am, but more. It doesn't 
matter, does it?" 

"Go on." 

"I didn't know about it myself 
for a long time. It's not like mindreading; it's not that clear. 1 was 
always—oh, sensitive, but I didn't 
understand it at first, and then later

on it seemed to get more and more 
pronounced. I — haven't told anyone about it before. Not anyone at 
all." 

She looked at him appealingly. 
Tony reassured her, 1 'You know 
you can trust me." 

"All righ t, I began to realize 
what it was when I was about 
twenty. That's why I became, of all 
things, a glassblower. If you had 
to listen to the moods and emotions of people, you'd want a job 
far away from everything in a one 
man department, too. That's why 
I came to Mars. It was too— too 
noisy on Earth." 

"And that's why you're the best 
assistant I ever had, with or withput an M.D. or R.N. on your 
name," said the doctor softly. 

"You're easy to work with." She 
smiled. "Most of the time, it is. 
Sometimes, though, you get so 
angry— 1 ' 

HE thought back, remembering 
the times she'd been there 
before he had called, or had left 
quickly when she was in the way, 
handed him what he needed before he actually (bought : about it. 

"Please don't get upset about it, 
Tony. I'd hate to have to stop 
working with you now. 1 don't 
know what you think, just what 
you — feel, I guess. There are a lot 
of people like that-, really; you 
must have sensed it in me a long 
time back. It isn't really so very 
strange," she pleaded. "I'm just a 



little— ^-a little more that way, that's 
all." 

"I don't see why I should get 
upset about it," he tried to soothe 
her, and realized sickeningly mat 
it was a useless effort. He literally 
could not conceal his feelings this 
time. He stopped trying. " You must 
realize how hard I try not to show 
I'm even angry. It is a little disconcerting to find out— I'll get 
used to it. Just give me time." He 
was thoughtful for a moment. 
"How does it work? Do you 
know?" 

"Not really. I 'hear' people's 
feelings. And — people seem to be 
more aware of my moods than they 
are of other people's: I— well, the 
way I first became aware of it was 
when somebody tried to — assault 
me, back on Earth, in Chicago. I 
was very young then, not quite 
twenty. It was one of those awful 
deserted streets, and he ran faster 
than I could and caught up with mc. 
Something sort of turned on*— I 
don't know how to say it. I wa> 
sending instead of receiving, but 
sending my emotion — which, naturally, was a violent mixture or 
fear and disgust — each more 
strongly than — than people usually 
can. I'm afraid I'm not making 
myself clear," 

"No wonder," he said heavily. 
"The language isn't built for experiences like that. Go on." 
• "He fell down and flopped on 
the sidewalk like a fish, and I ran 
on and got to a busy street with

out looking back. I read the papers, 
but there wasn't anything about it, 
so I suppose he was all right afterward." 

SHE stopped talking and jumped 
up restlessly. For quite a while 
she stood staring out of her window, toward the dark reaches of 
Laais Solis. 

Finally she said in a strained 
voice, "Please, Tony, it's not really 
a; bad as that sounded. I can't send 
all the time; I can't do. it mostly." 
She turned back to face him, and 
added more naturally: "Usually, 
people aren't as — open — as he was. 
And I guess I have to be pretty 
worked up, too. I tried to send tonight, and I couldn't do it. J tried 
awfully hard. That's why I had 
that headache." 
"Tonight?" 

"I'll tell you about ihat in a 
minute. Right now, I want — well,' 
I told you I never told anyone 
about this before. It's important to 
me, Tony, terribly important, to 
make you understand. You're the 
first person I ever wanted to have 
understand it, and if you keep on 
being frightened or unhappy about 
it, 1 just don't know — " 

She paused. "Let me tell you 
about it my way. I'll try to ignore 
whatever you feel while I'm telling 
it, and maybe when I'm done it 
will all be all right. 

"When that happened in Chicago — what I told you about; — -I 
had a job in an office. There was 



a girl I had to work with who 
didn't like me. It was very unpleasant. Every day for a month I tried 
to turn that 'send-receive' switch 
and transmit a calm, happy feeling 
to her, but I never could make it 
work. No matter how hard I tried, 
I couldn't get anything over to her. 
I knew what she felt, but her emotions were closed io mine. She 
didn't want to feel anything from 
me, so she didn't. Do you understand that? It's important, because 
it's true; you can protect yourself 
from that part of it. You believe 
me, don't you, Tony?," 

He didn't answer right away. 
He had to be absolutely certain in 
his own mind, because she would 
know. 

It would be far worse to tell 
her anything that wasn't true than 
to say nothing. 

Finally he got up and walked 
over to her, but he didn't dare 
speak. 

"Tony," she said, "you're — oh, 
please don't be embarrassed and 
difficult about it, but you're so 
good! That's what I meant, you're 
easy to work with. Most people 
arc petty and a lot of them are 
mean. The things they fee! aren't 
nice; they're mostly bitchy. But 
you — even when you're angry, it's a 
big, h on e s t kind of anger. You 
don't want to hurt people, or get 
even, or take advantage of them. 
You're honest, and generous, and 
good. And now I've said too 
much !"

He shook his head. "No, you 
didn't, It's all right. It really is." 

There were tears shining in her 
eyes. Standing over her, lie reached 
mechanically for a. tissue from his 
bag, tilted her head up, and wiped 
her eyes as if she were a child. 

"Now tell me more," he said, 
"and don't worry about how I feel. 
What happened tonight? Tell riie 
about the headache. And the fainting — was that part of jt too? Of 
course! What an idiot I am! The 
baby was choking and scared," and 
you screamed. You screamed and 
said to stop it." 

"Did .1? I wasn't sure whether I 
thought it or said it. That was 
strange, the whole business. -It was 
terrible, somebody who hurt awfully all over and couldn't breathe, 
and was going to — to burst if he 
couldn't, and that didn't seem to 
make sense — and terribly hungry, 
and terribly frustrated, and — I 
didn't know who it was, because 
it was so strong. Babies don't have 
such 'loud' feelings. I guess it was 
the reflex of fear of dying, except 
Sunny is very loud, anyhow. When 
he was being born — " 

SHE shuddered involuntarily. "I 
was awfully glad you didn't 
think to ask me to stay in there 
with you. When you sent Jim out,. 
I talked to him, and sort of — concentrated on listening' to him, and 
then, with the door closed, it was 
all right. (Anyhow, you want to 
know about tonight. The baby 



topped it off. I don't think that 
would have made me faint, by it-" 
self, but I was working in there, 
in the same room with Douglas 
Graham for an hour or more, 
and — " 

"Graham!" Tony broke in. "Do 
you mean to say he dared to — "■ 

"Why, Tony, 1 didn't know you 
cared!" 

For the first time that evening, 
she laughed easily. Then, without 
giving him time to think about how 
his outburst had given him away, 
she added: "He didn't do anything. 
It was — it was about what he was 
writing, I think. I know what he 
was feeling. He was angry and 
disgusted and contemptuous. He 
hurt inside himself, and he felt 
the way people do when they hurt 
somebody else. And it seemed to 
be all tied up with the story he was 
writing. It was a story about theColony, Tony, and I got worried 
and frightened. If only J could besure. See, that's the trouble. I 
didn't know whether to tell somebody or not, and I tried and tried 
to 'send' to him, but he wasn't 
Open at all, and the only thing 
that happened was that I got that 
headache." 

"Then when you came over to 
the Kandros'," Tony finished for 
her, "and the baby had all thai 
trouble, of course you couldn't takeit. Tell me more about Graham. T 
understand that you're not sure; 
tell me what you think, and why." 

"When Jim woke me up, we 



MARS CHILD 



53 



went back -to your place together, 
and Graham was working there," 
she said. "He asked me what the 
excitement was all about and I told 
him. He listened, kept asking questions, got every little detail out of 
me, and all the time he was feeling 
that hurt and anger. Then I started 
to work and he began banging 
away on his typewriter. And those 
thoughts got stronger and stronger 
till they made me dizzy, and then 
I started trying to fight back, to 
send — and I couldn't. That's all 
there was to it." 

"That's all? You're sure?" 

She nodded. 

"And you can't be certain what 
it was that he was feeling that way 
about?" 

"How could I?" 

"Well, then," he said, with .a 
laugh of relief, "there's nothing 
at all to worry about. You made 
a natural enough mistake. Those 
feelings of his weren't directed 
rightist the Colony at all, Anna. 
Earlier tonight, after you left, Graham promised to help us. He was 
writing a story about the spot we're 
in, that's all, and I know that he 
felt all the things you've described, 
but not about us, about Bell." He 
sat a moment longer. "I'm sure of 
it, Anna. That's the only way it 
makes sense." 

"It could be." She seemed a 
little dazed. "It didn't feel that way, 
but, of course, it could." She 
sighed and leaned back in her 
chair. "Oh, Tony, I'm so glad I 



told you. I didn't know what to 
do, and I was sure it was something vicious he was writing about 
the Colony." 

"Well, you can relax now. Maybe I'll let you go to bed." He took 
her hands and pulled her to her 
feet. "We'll work it out, even if I 
have to take a few new experiences 
in stride. Believe me, we'll work 
it out." 

She looked up at him, smiling 
gently. "I think so, too, Tony." 

HE could have let her hands go, 
but he didn't. Instead, he 
fl ush ed as he rea 1 i ze d that even 
now she was aware of all his feelings. There were tears shining in 
her eyes again, and this time he 
couldn't reach for a tissue. He 
leaned down and kissed her damp 
eyelids; then he dropped one hand 
to brush away the moisture on her 
cheek. 

A thousand thoughts raced 
through his mind. ,Earth, and Bell, 
and the Colony, now or forever or 
never. That time in the plane, 
thinking of Bea. Anna — Anna always there at his side, helping, understanding. 

"Anna," he said. He had never 
liked the name. "Ansie." There 
had been a little girl, a very long 
time ago, when he was a child, 
and her name had been Ansie. 

He released her other hand and 
cupped her upturned face in both 
of his. His head bent to hers, slowly and tenderly. There was no 



54 




 



fierceness here, only the hint of 
growing passion. 

When he lifted his lips from 
hers, he laughed and said quietly: 
"It saves words, doesn't it?" 

"Yes." Her voice was small and 
husky. "Yes, it does . . . dear." 

If his mind was "open," he 
might feel what she did. Cautiously and warily, he reached out to 
her, with his arms and with his 
mind. He needed no questions and 
no answers now. 

"Ansie!" he whispered again, 
and lifted her slender body. 

CHAPTER EIGHTEEN 

TAD'S left ear itched; he let it. 
"Operator on duty will not 
remove headphones under any circumstances until relieved — " There 
was a good hour before Gladys 
Porosky would show up to take 
over. 

"Mars Machine Tool to Sun 
Lake," crackled the head-set suddenly? He glanced at the clock and 
tapped out the message time on 
the log sheet in the typewriter before him. 

"Sun Lake to Mars Machine 
Tool, I read you, G. A,," he said 
importantly. 

' 'Mars Machine Tool to Sun 
Lake, message. Brenner Pharmaceutical to Marsport. Via Mars Machine Tool, Sun Lake, Pittco 
Three. Request reserve two cubic 
meters cushioned cargo space outgoing rocket. Signed Brenner. Re


peat, two cubic meters. Ack please 
G. A." 

Tad said: "Sun Lake, to Mars 
Machin e Tool, ' ' an d read back 
painstakingly from the log: "Message. Brenner Pharmaceutical to 
Marsport. Via Mars Machine Tool. 
Sun Lake, Pittco Three. Signet! 
Brenner. Repeat, two cubic meters, 
Received okay. T. Campbell, Operator, End." 

r I IAD'S fingers were flying over 
X the typewriter keyboard. Mimi 
and Nick would want to know how 
the rocket was filling up. The trick 
was to delay your estimated requirements to the last possible minute and then reserve a little more 
than you thought you'd need. Reserve too early and you might be 
stuck with space you couldn't fill 
but had to pay for. Reserve toe 
late and there might be no room 
for your stuff until the next rocket. 

"Mars Mach i n e Tool to Sun 
Lake, end," said the head-set. Tad 
started to raise Pittco's operator, 
the intermediate point between 
Sun Lake and Marsport, to boot 
the message on the last stage of its 
Journey. 

"Sun Lake to .Pittco Three," he 
said into the mike. No answer. Hewent into "the buzz," droning: 
"Pittco Three, Pittco Three, Pittco 
Three, Sun Lake — " 

"Pittco Three to Sun Lake, I 
read you," came at last, mushily, 
th rough the earphones. Tad was 
full of twelve-year- old scorn. Half

a minute to ack, and then probably 
with a mouthful of sandwich! "Sun 
Lake to Pittco Three," he said. 
"Message. Brenner Pharmaceutical 
to Marsport via Mars Machine 
Tool, Sun Lake, Pittco Three. Request reserve two cubic meters 
C ushioncd ca rg o s pace ou t goi ng 
rocket. Signed Brenner. Repeat, 
iwo cubic meters. Ack, please. 
G. A." 

"Pittco to Sun Lake, message received. Charlie Dyer, Operator, 
out." 

Tad fumed at tihe Pittco man's 
iloppiness and make-it-up-as-you-go 
procedure. Be a fine thing if everybody did that— messages would be 
garbled, short stopped, rocketloading fouled up, people and cargoes miss their planes. 

He tapped out on the log sheet: 
"Pittco Operator C. Dyer failed to 
follow procedure, omitted confirming repeat. T. Campbell." He omitted Dyer's irksome use of "out" 
i nstead of "end " and the other 
i rregularities, citing only the legally important error. That was just 
.self -protection; if there were any 
errors in. the final message, the 
weak spot on the relay could be 
identified. But Tad was uncomfortably certain that Dyer, if the report 
ever got back to him, would consider him an interfering brat. 

He bet Mr. Graham's last message had got respectful handling 
from Pittco, in spite of the painin-the-neck Phillips Newscode it 
had been couched in. They all 



wanted Graham. Tad had received 
half a dozen messages for the 
writer extending the hospitality of 
this industrial colony or that. The 
man had good sense to stick with 
Sun Lake, the boy thought approvingly. There was this jam with the 
rocket and the commissioner, but 
the Sun Lakers were unquestionably the best bunch of people on 
Mars. 

"Pittco to Sun Lake," said 
Dyer's voice in the earphones. 

"Sun Lake to Pittco, I read you, 
G. A.," snapped Tad. 

"Pittco Three to Pittco One, 
message. Via Sun Lake, Mars Machine Tool, Brenner Pharmaceutical, Distillery Mars, Rolling Mills. 
Your outgoing rocket cargo space 
requirements estimate needed here 
thirty-six hours. Reminder downhold cushion ed space request s

please, G. A." 

HUH ! Dyer repeated numbers 
on his stuff, all right! Tad 
acked and booted the message on. 
The machine shop in the "canal" 
confluence would get it, then the 
drug factory in the highlands dotted with marcaine weed, then the 
distillery among its tended fields of 
wiregrass, then the open hearth furnaces and rolling mills in the red 
taconite range, and at last Pittco 
One, in the heart of the silver and 
copper country.

He hoped he wouldn't have to 
handle any of Graham's long code 
jobs. Orders were to cooperate 
fully with the writer, but even 
Harve Stillman, who'd taken Graham's story on his rocket trip and 
Marsport, had run into trouble 
with it. Tad loafed through the 
material to the coded piece by Graham and shuddered. 

TT was okay, the. boy supposed, 
X for on Earth, where you didn't 
want somebody tapping a PTM 
transmission beam and getting your 
news story, but why did the guy 
have to show off on Mars where 
the only way out was by rocket 
and you couldn't get scooped? 

"Marsport 18 to Pittco Three," 
he heard faintly in the earphones. 
Automatically he ran his finger 
down the posted list of planes. 
Marsport 18 was a four-engine 
freighter belonging to the Marsport Hauling Company. 

"iPittco Three to Marsport 18, I 
read you, G. A." 

"Marsport 18 to Pittco, our estimated time of arrival is thirteen-fifty. Thirteen -fifty. We're bringing 
in your mail. End." 

"Pittco to Marsport 18, 0. K., 
E.T.A. is thirteen-fifty and I'll tell 
Mr. Hackenburg. End." 

Mail, thought Tad enviously. AH 
Sun Lake ever got was microfilmed 
reports from the New York office 
and business letters from customers. Aunt Minnie and Cousin Adelbert's wouldn't write to you unless 



you wrote to them; and Sun Lake 
couldn't lay out cash for space-mail 
stamps. 

Tad's ear itched. One thing he 
missed, he admitted to himself in 
a burst of candor, and he'd probably have to go on missing it. The 
Sun Lake Society of New York 
couldn't spontaneously* mail him 
the latest Captain Crusher Cow/x. 

He had read to tatters Volume 
CCXVII, Number 27, smuggled 
under his sweater from Earth. And 
to this day he hadn't figured out 
how the captain had escaped from 
the horrible jam he'd been in on 
Page 64. There had been a Venusian Crawlbush on his right, a Martian Brownie on his left, a Rigelian 
Paramonstcr drifting down from 
above and a Plutonian Bloodmole 
burrowing up from below. "Well, 
the writers of Captain Crusher 
knew their business, thought Tad, 
though they certainly didn't know 
much about Mars— the real Mars. 
Their hero never seemed to need 
OxEn or clothing any warmer than 
hose and cape when on a Martian 
adventure. And he was always 
stumbling over Brownies and dead 
cities and lost civilizations. 

Bunk, of course. Brownies, dead 
cities and lost civilizations would 
make Mars a more interesting 
place for a kid. iBut when a person 
grows up, other things mattered 
more than excitement. Things like 
doing a good job and knowing it. 
Things like learning. Getting 
along. Probably, Tad thought un

The repeats followed and Tad 
briskly receipted. He raised Pittco 
Three and booted the message, 
grinning at a muffled "God damn 
it !" over the earphones as he 
droned out -the bad news about 
Kelly. Steerage passenger space 
didn't come as high as cushioned 
cargo cubage; a steerage passenger 
was expected to grab a stanchion, 
hang on and take his lumps during 
a rough landing; but it was high 
enough. 

M 



SUN LAKE couldn't afford 
cushioned cubage, ever, and 
settled for braced antishift. Sometimes crates gave and split under 
the smashing accelerations, but the 
cash you had to lay out for cargo 
protected springs, hydraulic systems and meticulous stowage by 
the supercargo himself wasn't 
there. It meant a disgruntled customer every once in a while, but 
the tariffs made you play it that 
way. 

The door behind him opene3 
and closed. "Gladys ?" he asked. 
"You're early." 

"It's me, sonny," said a man's 
voice — Graham's. "You mind filing 
a little copy for me?" 

The newsman handed him a 
couple of onionskin pages. "Phillips .Newscode," he sajd. "Think 
you can handle it?" 

"I guess ^so," said Tad unhappily. "We're supposed to cooperate 
With you." Blankly he looked at 
the sheets and asked: "Why bother 
to code it, though?" 

"It saves space, for one thing. 
You get about five words for one. 
'GREENBAY,' for instance, means 
'An excited crowd gathered at the 
scene.' 'THREEPLY' means 'In 
spite of his, or their, opposition.' 
And, for another thing, what's the 
point of my knowing the code if 
I never use it?" He grinned to 
show he was kidding. 

Tad ignored the grin and remarked: "I thought that was it." 
He entered the time in the log 


 



and said into the mike; "Sun Lake 
to Pittco Three." Pittco acked. 

"Sun Lake to Pittco Three, long

GRAHAM heard the last of the 
s l or y S° out an d saw the kid 
note down the acknowledgment in 
the log. 

"Good job," the gunthcr said. 
"Thanks, fella." 

Outside, the chilly night air 
fanned his face. It had been a dirty 
little trick to play on the boy. 
They'd give him hell when they 
found out, but the message had u> 
clear and that Stillman knew a 
little Phillips— enough to wonder 
and ask questions. 

Graham took a swig from his 
pocket flask and started down the 
street. He'd needed the drink, and 
he needed a long walk, It was 
surgery, he told himself, but surgery wasn't always pleasant for the 



surgeon. That doctor might be able 
to understand if he could only step 
back and see the thing in perspective. As it was, Tony obviously believed Mrs. Kandro's absurd story 
about somebody doping the beans. 

The writer grinned sardonically. 
What a cesspool Mars must be if 
even these so-called idealists we're 
so corrupted! Marcaine addiction 
by a brand-new mother, theft of a 
huge quantity of marcaine clearly 
traced to the Colony. The doctor 
would hate him and think him twofaced, which he was. It was part of 
the job. He was going to start an 
avalanche; a lot of people would 
hate him for it. 

An impeccable, professional 
hatchet job on Sun Lake was the 
lever that would topple the boulder to start the avalanche. Senators 
would posture and declaim, bills 
would be written and rewritten by 
legislative clerks, but that would 
be just the dust over the rumbling 
rocks. 

The public relations boys of the 
industrials used to be newspapermen themselves, and they could 
pick their way through Phillips. 
The word would be passed like 
lightning. They'd learn, to their 
horror, that it wasn't going to be a 
cheerful travelog quickie like his 
last two or three; that Graham was 
out for blood. The coded dispatch 
would be talked over and worried 
■ over in most of Mars' administration buildings tonight. They would 
debate whether he was going to 



MARS CHILD 



put the blast on all the colonics. 
But they'd note that he pinned all 
the guilt so far on Sun Lake, not 
mentioning specifically that the 
abortion and the prostitution had 
occurred at Pittco. 

So, by tomorrow morning, he'd 
Jet one of the industrials send a 
plane for him. He'd been playing 
hard to get for two days — long 
enough. He'd put on his jovial 
mask and they'd fall all over themselves dishing the dirt on each 
other. He'd make it a point to pass ' 
through Brenner Pharmaceutical. 
Quasi-legal operators like Brenner 
always knew who was cutting corners. And Bell — what tills did he 
have his hand in? 

Graham knew there wasn't another newsman alive who could 
swing it — the first real story to 
come out of Mars besides press 
handouts from the industrials. And 
the planet was rotten-ripe for it. 

But, mostly, he would just scare 
them, be the scoffing, good-humored know-it-all, so cheerfully 
sinister that they'd try to buy him 
off with dirt about the other outfits. He'd make no open promises, 
nc open threats, and it all would 
*hop into his lap the way it always 
had.. 7 ' 

■No, not always, he grimly corrected himself. Once he'd been a 
green kid reporter, lucky enough 
to break the Bell scandal. He'd actually been sorry for the crook. 
There' d been a lot of changes since. 
It was funny what happened to 



you when you got into the upper 
brackets. 

FIRST you grabbed and grabbed. 
Women, a penthouse with a 
two-acre living room, silk sfai rt s 
"built" for you instead of the nylon all the paycheck stiffs wore, 
"beefsteaks" broiled over bootleg 
charcoal made of real wood from 
one of Earth's few thousand acres 
of remaining trees. 

You grabbed and grabbed, and 
then you got sick of grabbing. You 
felt empty and blank and worked 
like hell to make yourself think 
you were happy. And then, if you 
were lucky, you f ound out who 
you were. 

Graham had found out that he 
— the youngest one, underfed, the 
one the big boys ganged up on for 
snitching, the one the cop called a 
yellow little liar, the one nobody 
liked, the one who always got his 
head knucked when they played 
Nigger Inna Graveyard — yes, he 
had power. It was the monstrous 
energy of- .Earth's swarming billions. If you could reach them, you 
could have them. You could slash 
down what was rotten and corrupt; 
a thieving banker, a bribed commissioner, a Mars colony. 

Under the jovial mask it hurt 
when they called you a sensationalist, said you were unanalytical, had 
no philosophy, couldn't do anything 
but set down facts to titillate the 
uncritical audience. But what you 
could do and they couldn't was stir

the billions of Earth, make them 
laugh, make them hopeful, make 
them rage — and when they raged, 
focus their rage to a. white-hot spot 
that cauterized a particular bit of 
rottenness. 

Graham stumbled and took a 
swig from his flask. 

Who had to have a philosophy? 
* What was wrong with exposing 
crackpots and crooks? Tl^e first real 
news story out of Mars would break 
Up the Sun Lake Colony. Somegood would go with the bad; the 
-surgeon had no choice. That Kanctro woman and her baby! "The 
child belonged on jEarth. And it 
would go there. The little thing 
would never know if not for Graham that there was anything but 
Mars. I'm supposed to be hardboiled, he thought, a little drunk 
and sentimental, but 1 know what's 
right for that kid. 

"Hey!" he said. Where the hell 
was he, anyway? Wandering in the 
desert, high as a kite on.ihis expected triumph. His feet had led him 
down the Colony street, along the 
path to the airfield, past it and a 
few kilometers toward the Rimrock 
Hills. He blamed it on the Mars 
gravity. Your legs didn't tire here, 
for one thing. The radio shack light 
was plain behind him; dimmer and 
off to the left of it shone the windows of the Lab, merged in one 
beacon. 

The radio shack light went out 
and then on again. A moment later, 
so did the light from the Lab. 



"Power interruption," he said. 
"Or I blinked." 

- It happened again, first the radio 
shack and then the Lab. And then 
it happened once more. 

The writer took out his flask and 
gulped. "Who's out there?" he 
yelled. "I'm Graham!" 

There wasn't any answer, but 
something came whistling out of 
the darkness at him, striking his 
parka and falling to the ground. 
He fumbled for it while still trying to peer' 'through the night for 
whatever had passed between him 
and the lights of Sun Lake. 

"What do you want?" he yelled 
into the darkness hysterically. "I'm 
Graham ! The writer ! Who are 
you ?' ' 

Something whizzed at him and 
hit his shoulder. 

"Cut that out!" he shrieked, and 
began to run for the lights of Sun 
Lake. He had taken only a few 
steps when something caught at his 
leg and he floundered onto the 
ground. The next and last thing 
he felt was a paralyzing blow on 
the back of his head. 

CHAPTER NINETEEN 

npONY woke up in time f or 
-I- breakfast, an achievement in 
itself. He'd had, at best, some hundred and fifty minutes of sleep 
after a long and hard day, and that 
interrupted by emergency, crisis, 
and triumph. 

He washed without noticing the 



MARS CHILD 



61 




stench of the alcohol. He noted the 
time; good thing there was no Lab 
inspection to do this morning. He 
noticed the closed bedroom door; 
good thing he'd so hospitably given 
up his own bed to Graham, considering the unexpected turn of events 



the night before. He threw his 
parka over his shoulders and 
stepped out into the wan sunlight, 
oblivious to the lingering chill; 
good thing heGood thing he could still laugh 
at himself, he decided. What was 



62 




 



the old saw about all the world 
loving a lover? Nothing to it — it 
was the lover who loved the whole 
world . Lo ve, lo ver, lo v'tng, he 
rolled the words around in his 
mind, trying to tell himself that 
nothing had really_c hanged. All the 
old problems were still there, and 
a new one, really, taken on. 

But that wasn't so. Graham had 
spent half the night writing his 
promised story. Sunny Kandro was 
all right at last. And Anna — Ansie 
— a problem? He cduld remember 
thinking, in the distant past, as 
long as two days ago, that such an 
involvment would present problems, but he couldn't for the life 
of him remember what they were 
supposed to have been. 

HE went in to breakfast, not 
trying to conceal his exuberance, and sat down between Harve 
Stillman and Joe Gra«ey. 

"What's got into you?" Harve 
asked. 

"Something good happen?" Gracey demanded. 

Tony nodded. "The Kandro 
baby," lie explained, using the first 
thing that popped into his head. 
"Jim woke me up last night. Polly 
was — was having trouble with the 
baby," be hastily amended the 
story. 

He'd have to tell Gracey about 
(he marcaine. There was a problem 
after all, but this wasn't the plate 
for it; a Council meeting after 
breakfast maybe. 



"You know we've been having 
feeding trouble all along," he explained. "I found the trouble last 
night. I don't understand it, but it 
works. I took Sunny's mask off." 

"You what?" 

"Took his mask off; he doesn't 
need it. Eats fine without it, too. 
Trouble was, he couldn't breathe 
through his mouth and eat at the 
same time." 

"Well, rU be— How do you 
figure it?" 

"Hey, there's a story for the guntlier," Harve suggested. " 'Medical 
Miracle on Mars,' and all that stuff. 
Where is he anyhow?" 

"Still sleeping, I guess. The bedroom door was closed." 

"Did you talk to him last night?" 
Gracey asked. 

Tony attacked his plate of fried 
beans, washed them down with a 
gulp of "coffee," and told the 
other man about Graham's promise. "He was up half the night 
writing, too. I heard him while I 
was examining the baby." 

"Did he show it to you?" 

"Not yet. He was asleep when 
I got back." 

Harve pushed back his chair 
with a grunt of satisfaction. "I feel 
better already," he grinned. "First 
decent meal I've had in days. 
What's the program for today, 
Doc ? You going to need me on 
radiological work?" 

"I don't think so. I'll let you 
know if wc do, after Joe and I get 
together with the others. Got time 



MARS CHILD 



63 



for a meeting after breakfast?" he 
asked the agronomist, and Gracey 
nodded. 

"Okay, I'll be in the radio shack 
if you want me," Harve said. "The 
kids took over all day yesterday. 
Don't like to leave them -too long 
on their own." 

"Right. But I don't think we'll 
need you." 

That marcaine business — how in 
all that was holy, the doctor wondered, did anybody get marcaine 
onto Polly's beans? After all the 
searching, in the middle of the 
hunt, who would do it? Why? And 
above all, how? 

Maybe one of the others would 
have an angle on it. 

ii 

*</"YNE thing I'm glad about," 
\~/ Gracey said soberly. "We 
did make a thorough search. Whatever happens from here on out, at 
least we've proved to our own satisfaction that nobody in Sun Lake 
stole the stuff." 

"That's nice to know," Mimi 
agreed with considerably less feeling. "But frankly, I'd almost feel 
better if^we bad found it. I'd gladly turn the bum who took it over 
to Bell's tender mercies, if it was 
one of us. This way, we have to 
depend on Graham. You're sure 
he's with us?" She looked questioningly from the doctor to the 
electronics man. 

"How sure can you get?" Nick 



shrugged. "He said so. Now we 
wait to see his story, that's all." 

"I don't think we have to worry 
about that," Tony said briefly. He 
couldn't tell them any more. He 
was sure himself, but how could 
he explain without giving away 
Anna's secret? "Look," he went on 
briskly, "there's something else we 
do have to think about. I told you 
about Sunny Kandro, Joe. There's 
more to it than What I said at 
breakfast." 

Nick and Mimi both sat forward 
with new interest, as Tony repeated the news about (he removal of 
Sunny 's mask. He cut off their 
questions. "I didn't tell you how 
it started, though. Jim came to get 
me, not f or the baby, but for 
Polly." 

A sharp rap on the door stopped 
him. Harve Stillman walked in. 
His face was grim; he carried a 
familiar sheaf of onionskin pages 
in his hands. 

"What's the matter, Harve?" 
Mimi demanded. "Aren't you supposed to be on shift in the radio 
shack?" 

"That's right. I walked out." 

"No relief?" she snapped. "Are 
you sick?" 

"I'm sick, all right. And it 
doesn't make any difference now 
whether radio's manned or not." 
He slapped the onionskin onto the 
table, and threw down on top of it 
two sheets of closely written radio 
log paper. "There you are, folks, 
have a look. It's all down in black 



64 




 



and white. That's the translation 
on the log sheets. The bastard filed 
it in Phillips, so Tad wouldn't 
know what he was sending. When 
I think what a sucker I was, letting 
him pump me about who knew 
newscode around here! Go on, 
read it!" 

Mimi picked up the sheets and 
glanced at the penciled text. Her 
face went white. She reached for 
the onionskin, glanced at it, and 
returned her eyes to the log sheets. 
In a minute she looked up again. 

"Harve, there couldn't be any 
mistake?" 

"I know the code," he said, 
bluntly. 

Hey,' ' Nick protes ted, ' 'could 
you maybe let us in on it?" 

*' /CERTAINLY," she smiled bitV-^ terly. "This is the story 
written for us by D. Graham, your 
friend and mine. 'I was greeted by 
a frightened crowd on my arrival 
at Sun Lake, and no wonder. After 
two days in this community, I am 
able to reply to the heads-in-theclouds idealists who claim that on 
Mfaxs lies the hope of the human 
race. My reply is that on Mars I 
immediately came face-to-face into 
drunkenness, prostitution, narcotics, criminal abortion, and murder. 
It is not for me to say whether 
this means that Sun Lake Colony, 
an apparent center of these activities, should be shut down by law 
and its inmates deported to Earth. 
But I do know — ' " 

MARS CHILD 



"That's crazy!" Nick broke in. 
"'I heard him say myself — " He 
stood up angrily. 

Tony reached out a hand to restrain him. "He didn't promise a 
damn thing, Nick. We just heard 
it that way. He said he'd do a 
story, that's all." 

"That's enough for me," Cantrella replied. "He promised, and 
he's by God going to keep his 
promise." 

"Sit down, Nick," Mimi interrupted. "Beating Graham up isn't 
going to solve anything, Harve, you 
get back on duty, and buzz one of 
the kids to go over to Tony's and 
collect Graham. If he's asleep, tell 
them to wake him up. We'll go 
through the rest of this while we're 
waiting." She eyed the sheets of 
paper distastefully. 

Harve slammed the door behind 
him, and Mimi turned to the others. "I'm sorry. I should have 
checked with you first. Every time 
something goes wrong, I start giving orders as if I owned the place. 
Here." She handed the sheets to 
Joe Gracey, still sitting quietly to 
her left. "You look calm. You read 
it." 

Joe took the papers and went on 
where she had stopped before. 

' s He can't do that!" Nick protested furiously, when Joe finished. 
"That story is full of lies ! The 
murder wasn't here. Neither was 
most of the other stuff. How can 
he—" 

"He did," Tony pointed out. 

65 



"How much convincing do you 
need ?" 

"It's carefully worded," Gracey 
said. "Most of it isn't lies at all, 
just evasions and implications." 

"We've got to assume he's smart 
enough to write a libel-proof 
story." Mimi had recovered her 
briskness. "There's one place I 
think he slipped, though. Can I 
see those sheets of Graham's again, 
Joe?'; 

HER eyes were shining when 
she looked up again. "We've 
got him!" she said. "I'm sure of 
it! Let's call in O'Donnell and get 
his opinion on it. This stuff about 
Polly." She read aloud: "'...the 
young mother of a newborn baby, 
unable to feed her infant because 
of her hopeless addiction to marcaine. This reporter was present at 
a midnight emergency when the 
Colony's doctor was called to save 
the child from the ministrations of 
its hysterical mother . . Tony, 
you can testify to that!" 

"I don't know," said the doctor, pain f u lly. "Sure, I real ize 
Polly's not an addict, but — that's 
what J was starting to tell you 
when Harve came in. That's what 
Jim got me up for last night. Polly 
was sick, and there's no doubt that 
it was a dose of marcaine that was 
responsible." 
"What?" 
"Polly?" 

"But she couldn't be the one. 
She was — " 



"How did Graham find out 
about it?" 

Tony waited till the questions 
stopped, then gave them the whole 
story, from the time Jim Kandro 
roared into his house at one o'clock 
in the morning, right through the 
removal of the mask. 

"We were both asleep when 
Kandro came in," he explained, 
"and the noise woke Graham too. 
I didn't see him again myself, but 
I heard him typing when I was in 
the hospital with the baby. And 
Ans — .Anna told me she talked to 
him while she was making the 
bottles. She had no reason to hold 
back any information. I told her 
myself that he was writing a friendly story." 

"Well, that fixes us, but good. 
Where did Polly get the stuff?" 
Nick demanded. "We've hunted 
every inch of this place looking for 
marcaine; how come it didn't show 
up?" 

"I've been trying to figure that 
myself," Tony said. "I don't think 
she got it. Her reactions were not 
those of a marcaine user, and I'd 
swear she was as shocked as she 
said she was when I diagnosed it. 
The stuff was put there — and don't 
ask me who, or why, because I 
can't even begin to guess." 

"Well, we've got our hands 
full," Mimi said thoughtfully. 
"Where do we start? It seems to 
me the same answer is going to 
settle two of our problems. Where 
did .Polly's marcaine come from. 




 



and how are we ever going to get 
out of this impossible situation with 
Bell?" 

"That's not all," Nick added 
grimly. "We can solve both of 
those, and still get booted off Mars 
when this story breaks." 

"That's a separate matter. All I 
can do about that is try and talk 
to Graham — or prove to him that 
at least part of the story is libelous. 
Come in," Mimi called, in answer 
to a knock outside. 

Gladys Porosky pushed the door 
open and announced breathlessly: 
"Wc can't find him. We looked all 
over and he's not any place. 1 * 

"Graham?" Tony jumped to his 
feet. "He was asleep in my bedroom; I left him there. He has to 
be around." 

GLADYS shook her head. "We 
opened the door when he 
didn't answer, and he wasn'i there. 
Then we scattered; all the kids 
have been looking. He's not at the 
Lab, or in the fields, and he's not 
in any of the houses. Nobody's 
seen him all morning." 

"Thanks, Gladys," Mimi cut her 
short. "Will you try to find Jack 
O'Donnell for me? Ask him to 
come over here." 

"Okay." She slammed out of the 
door, leaving a whirlwind of babble 
and excitement behind her. 

"I suppose he's skipped," Tony 
said. "Probably messaged one of 
the industrial outfits in that damn 
code of his, and got picked up dur


ing the night. His bags are still 
at my place, though — I saw them 
this morning. Thai's funny." 

Very f unny," Nick echoed 
glumly. "Ha, ha." 

"What's luggage to a guy who 
can write like that?" Graccy asked. 
"He can get all the luggage he 
wants just by wiping out another 
plague spot like us." • 

O'Donnell came in, and they 
waited in tense silence while the 
ex-lawyer read through Harve's 
penciled translation. "Only possible libelous matter I see is about 
the marcaine-addict mother. What's 
all that?" 

They told him, and he shook his 
head. "No more chance in a court 
of law than a snowball in hell," he 
said flatly. 

"But I don't care bow he worded it. The story's not true." 

"How many stories are? If truth 
or justice made any difference in 
the lEarth courts, I wouldn't be 
here. I loved the law. The way it 
looked in the books, that is. I guess 
I'll have to pass my bar examinations all over again. Mars is under 
the Pan State, but 1 suppose this 
constitutes interrupted residence 
anyway. 

"Big fat chance you'll have of 
getting to take your bar exams after 
that smear," said Gracey. "I'm not 
kidding myself about getting to 
teach college again. If I can get 
some money together, I'm going to 
try commercial seaweeds." 

"God help Sargasso Limited," 



MARS CHILD 



said Nick Cantrella. "And God 
help Consolidated Electronic when 
I start my shop again in Denver. 
It took them three months to run 
me into bankruptcy last trip 
around, but get them up to 
four <this time. They can't stand 
much of that kind of punishment." 

"Let's not jump to conclusions," 
Mimi said, with the quiver back 
in her determinedly businesslike 
voice. "Let's assume Graham's 
skipped and the story's going 
th rough . We m igh t still be abl e 
tc hang on if we can scjuare ourselves with Bell." 

"Bell and Graham have no use 
for each other," Tony said. "Maybe this will make Bell easier to 
deal with." 

"That I doubt. Let's figure on 
the worst. Suppose we can't convince Bell. We"ll have two possible 
courses of action. We can sell out 
fast. From what I understand of 
this situation, I'm sure that the 
Commissioner would find a legal 
loophole for us on the marcaine 
deal if we decided to sell to, for 
instance, \Brenner. If we do that, 
wc can pay off what money we owe 
on Earth, book passage for our 
members, and, with luck, have a 
few dollars left over to divide between us." She smiled humorlessly. 
"You might even have a capital investment of iive or ten 'dollars, 
Nick, to start working on ConElectron." 

"Good enough," he said. "It'll 
give me courage — if I can still find 



a bar with a five-buck beer, that 
is." 

"That," Mimi went on, "would 
be the smart thing to do. But 
there's another way. We can hang 
on through the cordon, hoping to 
prove our point. It leaves us some 
hope, but it leaves us penniless, 
even if we manage to stick out the 
six months. Whatever cash or 
credit we have on hand we'll have 
to pay out for OxEn. Don't think 
Bell is going to let us have the stuff 
free. Meanwhile, our accounts payable keep coming due, and accumulating interest. There's a good 
chance that long before the six 
months are up we'll be forced into 
involuntary bankruptcy. That's how 
Pittco got Economy Metals last 
year." 

"Like the cat got the canary," 
said Nick. 

"Yes. We'd then be shipped 
back to Earth as distress cases, with 
a prior lien on our future earnings. 
If any." 

MIMI sat down and* Tony 
studied her handsome face 
as if he were seeing it for the first 
time. She'd been way up in the 
auditing department of a vast insurance company ■ once. It would 
be hard on her. It would be hard 
on them all. But he wanted to yell 
and beat down doors when he 
thought of what it would mean to 
Anna, plunged back into the 
screaming hell of Earth's emotional 
"'noise" that she couldn't block out. 




 



He tried to think like a schemer, 
and^ knowing that it wouldn : t 
work, told himself : You marry 
Anna, take Brenner's offer — it's 
still open; good doctors aren't that 
easy to come by on Mars — and you 
set her up in a decent home. But 
the whole thing crumbled under its 
own weight. She wouldn't marry a 
doctor whose doctoring was to • 
patch up marcaine factory hands 
when they sniffed too much of the 
stuff. 

"Eh?" he asked. Somebody was 
talking to him. 

"Sell now, or hang on?" Mimi 
patiently repeated. 

"I want to think about it," he 
told her. 

The others felt the same way. It 
wasn't a thing you could make up 
your mind about in a few minutes, 
not after the years and years of 
always thinking one way: Colony 
survival. To have to decide now 
which way to kill the Colony . . . 

The meeting broke up inconclusively. There was some recrating still to be done. The Lab had 
to be back to production, get this 
rocket's shipments ready just in 
case. And maybe by the time those 
chores were done, one of' them 
would have some notion of how 
to start ail over again, looking for 
the mysterious marcaine. 

Tony headed out to the Lab, 
racking his brains for an answer. 
But halfway there, he found to his 
chagrin that he wasn't serious at 
all. He was striding along freely 



in the clean air and light gravity, 
to the rhythmic mental chant: 
Ansie — Anna — Ann — Ansie — 

CHAPTER TWENTY 

JOAN RADCLIFF lay almost 
peacefully, drugging herself 
against the pain in her limbs and 
head by a familiar reverie of which 
she never tired. She saw Sun Lake 
Colony at some vague time in the 
future, a City of God, glowing 
against the transfigured Martian 
desert, spiring into the Martian air, 
with angelic beings vaguely recognizable in some way as the original 
colonists. 

Her Hank, the bold explorer, 
with a bare-chested, archaic, swordgirt look; Doctor Tony, calm and 
wise and very old, soothing ills 
with miraculous lotions and calming troubled minds with dignified 
counsel; Mimi Jonathan, revered 
and able, disposing' of this and that 
with sharp, just terseness; Anna 
Willendorf mothering hundreds 
serenely; brave Jim and Polly Kandro and their wonderful cjiild, the 
hope of them all. 

She wasn't there herself, but it 
was all right because she had done 
something wonderful for them. 
They all paused and lowered their 
voices when they thought of her. 
She, the sick and despised, had in 
the end surprised and awed them 
all by doing something wonderful 
for them, and they paid her memory homage. 



MARS CHILD 



■Nagging reality, never entirely 
silent, jeered at her that she was a 
useless husk ■draining the Colony's 
priceless food and water, giving 
nothing in return. She shifted on 
the bed. 

iPains shot through her joints 
and her heart labored. You're as 
good as they are, whispered the 
tempter; you're better than they are. 
How many of them could stand the 
pain and not murmur, never think 
of anything but the good of the 
Col ony ? But I'm not, she raged 
back. I'm not. I shouldn't have got 
sick; I can't pork now; they have 
to nurse me. But you didn't drink 
any water until Tony made you, 
said the tempter. Wasn't that more 
than any of them would do? Won't 
they be sorry when you're dead and 
they find out how you suffered? 

She tried to fix her tormented 
mind on her Hank, but he had a 
sullen, accusing' stare. She was tying him down; if they sent her 
back to Earth, he'd have to go tooThey wouldn't let him stay in the 
Colony. 

SHE wished Anna hadn't left, 
and swallowed the thought 
painfully. Anna's time belonged to 
the Colony and not to her. It was 
nasty of her to want Anna to stay 
with her so much. She straightened 
one puffy leg and felt a lance of 
pain shoot from toes to groin;' she 
bared her clenched teeth but didn't 
let a whimper escape her. 

That ivas very good, said the 




7D 




 



tempter. None of them could do 
that. 

Anna had propped her up in 
bed before, so she could look out 
the window. Now she turned her 
head slowly and looked out. 

/ see through the window, she 
told herself. / see across the Colony 
street to a corner of the Kandros' 
hut with a little of their streets'rde 
window showing. I see Polly Kandro cleaning the inside of the 
window, but she doesn't see me. 
Now she's coming out and cleaning 
the outside of the window. Now 
she turns and sees me and tvaves 
and / smile. Now she takes her 
cloth and goes around her hut to 
clean the back window and I can't 
see her any more. ' 

And now something glides down 
the Colony street with Sunny Kandro in its thin brown arms. 

And now Polly runs around her 
hut agd'ni, her face white as chalk, 
tries faintly to call me, wave to me, 
and falls down out of sight. 

Joan knew what she ought to 
do, and she tried. The intercom 
button had been put in so she had 
only to move her hand a few 
inches. She reached out for the 
button, and held her finger on il, 
but there was no answering click. 
It was a few seconds and maybe 
minutes, and the thing that had 
stolen Pollys baby was gone dovn 
the other end of the street. 

The sick girl sat up agonizingly 
and thought: / can do something 
now. They won't be able to say I 



was foolish, because if I wait any 
longer I won't be able to catch up; 
it will be too far away. There's nobody else to do it except Polly, and 
she fainted. It has to be done right 
away, / can't wait for them to answer and then come from the Lab. 

Joan stood up, stumped over to 
the canteen on the wall and tilted 
it for a long, long drink of cool 
water. It tasted good. She lurched 
out of the hut and stood for a moment, looking at the crumpled body 
of Polly. 

Poor Polly, she thought as her 
heart thudded and faltered. We 
must help one another. 

She sliaded her eyes against the 
late morning sun and looked up 
and past the Colony street through 
the clear .Mars air. There was a 
• moving dot passing the airfield 
now, and she started after it, one 
step, two steps, three steps, as the 
City of God reformed in her mind 
and her eyes never left the moving 
dot. 

EARTH would be gone, a dead 
thing swimming in the deeps 
of space, a grave example for 
children. Sec? You must not hate, 
you must not fear, you must always help or that will happen to 
as. You must be kind and like people; you mustn't make weapons 
because you never know where 
making weapons will end. 

And the children would ask 
curiously what it was like, and their 
elders would tell them it was 



MARS CHILD 



71 



crowded and dirty, that nobody 
ever had enough to eat, that people 
poured poison into the air and pretended it didn't matter. That it 
■wasn't like Sun Lake, their spacious, 
clean, sweet-smelling home, that 
there wouldn't have been any Sun 
Lake if not for the great pioneers 
like Joan RadclifF who suffered and 
died for them. 

She wept convulsively at the pain 
in her limbs as she stumped across 
the desert rocks. They sliced her 
bare feet but she dared not look 
down ahead of her for fear of losing that summing, moving dot she 
followed. Magic, she thought. Fix a 
fa/ry with your eye and away it 
cannot fly. Her heart — she could 
feel it thudding ponderously as a 
tnassive new pain burned through 
her left shoulder and arm. 

1 have done what I could, she 
thought. Hank, you are free. She 
fell forward and dragged her 
sprawled right arm along the 
ground so that it pointed to the 
moving dot and the Rimrock Hills 
beyond it. 

ii 

SOMEBODY grabbed him by 
the arm and motioned to his 
helmet. Tony stared a moment, uncomprehending, then switched on 
the helmet radio. 
"What's up?" 

"Joan — Joan Kadcliff!" It was 
one of Mimi's young assistants in 
the Lab office. "She picked up the 



intercom and buzzed it. When I 
answered it, it went dead." 

"I'll be right out." The doctor 
made it on the double, in spite of 
the hampering suit, out of the shipping room and into the shower. 
He would have given a year of his 
own life to be able to speed up 
the decontamination process this 
one time, but he'd been near the 
open crates. It wouldn't help Joan 
if he exposed himself, and her, 
too, to radiation disease. 

He ran the distance' from the 
Lab to the street of houses. He was " 
still running when he approached 
the Kandros' hut, and almost 
missed seeing Polly's limp figure 
in the road. Thoroughly bewildered, he picked her up and looked 
around for help. There was no one 
in sight. 

A moment's indecision, and 
then, quickly, he carried Polly toward the RadclifF hut and deposited her gently on the wall bunk in 
the living room. Pulse and respiration okay; she would keep. He 
headed for Joan's bedroom. 

The doctor wasted a scant second staring at the empty bed; to 
him it seemed an endless time that 
had gone by. He pressed the intercom button, and waited through 
another eternity ti II the Lab an swered. 

Whatever had happened, whatever mysterious force had removed 
Joan from her bed and left Polly 
unconscious in the street, this, he 
realized, must have been the ulti


72 




 



mate agony for Joan — to lie in this 
bed, in dreadful haste, to press this 
button and wait and wait until it 
was too late . . . 

"That you. Doc? What's up?" 

"Trouble. Get Jim KandrO out 
here. To the Radcliffs ! And get 
Anna. Send her to Kandros'. 
There's no one with the baby. Is 
Mirni there? Put her on." 

"Tony?" The Lab Administrator's crisp voice was reassuring; he 
could leave part of the problem, at 
least, in her competent hands. 

"There's trouble here, Mini — 
don't know wh.it, but Polly's fainted and Joan's disappeared." 

"I'll be right there." She hung 
up. Tony repealed one step toward 
the living room, had an afterthought, and went back to the intercom. 

"Get Cantrella here, too," he 
told the Lab office. "Tell him to 
bring along the c.e.g. setup. Fast." 

Polly didn't look too bad. Marcaine again? He'd know soon. 

What was going on? 

Jim Kandro burst in, panting 
and terrified. His wide eyes went 
froth his wife to the doctor, and a 
Single miserable word came from 
him! 

"Again?" 

"I don't know. She fainted. 
Take her home, then look at 
Sunny. Anna's on her way over to 
help you." 

Jim left with his burden in his 
arms, and Tony returned to the 
sick girl's bedroom. There was no 



trace, no clue, nothing he could 
.find. He saw the wall canteen, upended, and went toward it with 
excitement. A puddle of water on 
the floor. Incredible carelessness for 
Sun Lake, but it meant something. 
Joan hadn't been carried away; she 
had gone herself. She had stopped 
for water and left the canteen this 
way. 

A heartbroken shout from across 
the street sent him running out of 
the house, over to the Kandros'. 

The living room was empty. 

In the bedroom, Polly lay alone, 
still unconscious. He found Kandro in the new nursery, squatting 
on the floor beside the baby's 
empty crib, rocking in misery. 

CHAPTER 1AVENTY-ONE 

"fpHEY ought to get the test 

-L finished in a few minutes, 
but if you're ready, yon might as 
well start now. It's a hundred to 
one chance against its being anything but cave dirt" Joe Gracey 
crumbled between skinny, sensitive 
fingers a bit of soil taken from the 
nursery floor. 

"As soon as we get the transceiver," Mimi said. "Harve's bringing it over now." 

Anna appeared in the doorway. 
"She's conscious now." 

Tony went back into the bedroom. "Polly?" 

Her eyelids fluttered open and 
closed. Her pulse was stronger, but 
she wasn't really ready to talk. He 



MARS CHILD 



73 



had to try. Without a stimulant, if 
possible. 

'"What happened, Polly ?' ' he 
asked. 

"What's the use?" she said 
feebly. "What's the use? We tried 
and tried on Earth, and I just got 
sick, and we had Sunny here, and 
now they've taken him. It isn't any 
good." 

"Who's taken him, Polly?" 

"I went out to clean the windows. I cleaned the front window 
and then I went around to clean 
the back window. When I looked 
in Sunny was gone. That's all. They 
took him. They just took him." 

"Who took him, Polly?" 

"I don't know. Brownies. We 
tried and tried on Earth — " 

THE doctor took Anna to one 
side. "She's too lucid," he 
whispered. "Do you 'hear' anything?" 

"Hardly anything." Anna shook 
her head. "She's numb. She's more 
conscious than she looks. Just 
numb. Doesn't care." 

"Short," Tony muttered. "There 
will be a reaction. She shouldn't be 
left alone." 

"I'll stay," Anna offered. 

"No, not you. We'll need you 
along with us." 

"I'd rather not," she said. 

"Ansie," he pleaded, biting 
back his angry disappointment. 

"I shouldn't have told you," she 
said dully. "I should never have 
told anybody. All right, I'll go." 



He smiled and gripped her arm. 
"Of course you will. You would 
have anyway." 

"No," she said. "I wouldn't." 

"Then maybe it's a good thing 
you told me." His voice was stern, 
but his hand pulled her closer to 
him. 

Polly twisted on the bed and 
sobbed. Anna pulled away. "Maybe." She bit her lip, looked up at 
him. "Only please don't be angry 
at me. I can't stand it if you keep 
getting angry at me." She turned 
and fled. 

Tony went back to the bed, erasing Anna and her problems from 
his mind with practiced determination. Polly was trembling uncontrollably. There was no more information to be had from her. He 
gave her a sedative and went out 
to join the others. 

Harve had arrived with the 
transceiver in his hand. On Anna's 
suggestion, a rush call was sent 
out for Hank Radcliff to stay with 
Polly. He didn't know about Joan; 
they decided not to tell him about 
it. 

"We need a man here with 
her," the doctor explained briefly. 
"The baby's disappeared, and 
we're going out now and try to 
track it. Polly might want to get 
up and follow. Yon keep her in 
bed." 

"Sure, Doc." 

"Nick Cantrella will be over 
with some equipment. Tell him to 
test Polly." 



74 




 



THEY left the house, Mimi and 
Anna and the doctor, Jim Kandro, Harve Stillman, and Joe Gra
' 'Look at that. 1 ' Gracey "was 
bending over in the road, pointing 
to the barely discernible mark of a 
bare toe. Here in the bottom of the 
old "canal" bed, where the settlement was built, the land retained 
a trace of moisture, enough to hold 
an impression for a while. 

Only part of a toe, but it pointed 
a direction. 

They headed up the street, past 
the huts toward the landing field. 

"Hey, Joe!" Someone was 
pounding up the lull after them, 
shouting. 

It was one of the men from the 
Agro Lab. 

"That test — it's from the hills, 
all right, most likely from inside a 
cave, but hill dirt. That all you 
wanted ?" 

"Right. Thanks." 

"They told me you wanted the 
word fast," the man said curiously. 
"Glad I caught you." 

"Glad you did," Gracey agreed 
mildly. "Thanks again." He turned 
his back on the man. "Let's go." 

They topped the slight rise that 
marked the farthest extent of the 
old river bed's former inundations, 
and faced a featureless expanse of 
level desert land, broken only by 
Lazy Girl, chocked on the landing 
field at their left, and the hills in 
the distance. No other human being was in sight. It was hopeless to 



look for footprints here, in the 
constantly shifting dust. 

"The hills?" Mimi said. 

Tony looked at Anna; she 
shrugged almost imperceptibly. 

"Might as well," he agreed. 

They moved forward , Kand ro 
Striding ahead with his great hands 
knotted into bony fists, his eyes set 
on the hills, unaware of the ground 
under his feet or of the people 
with him. It was Harve who found 
the print they had known was impossible—not really a footprint, 
but a spot of moisture, fast evaporating, still retaining a semblance 
of the shape of a human foot. 

A little farther on there was another; they were going the "right 
way. Tony stopped for a minute at 
one of the damp spots, poked a 
finger curiously into the ground. 
Grit and salt, as he had expected. 

She couldn't have lived through 
it. He didn't know how she got as 
far as she did, but even if her heart 
held out, she must have sweated her 
life away to have left those damp 
indicators in the thirsty soil. 

Only a little farther and the 
ground began to be littered with 
the refuse of the Rimrock Hills — 
here and there a sliver of stone, a 
drift of mineral salts. Gradually, 
the dust gave way to sharp rock 
and hard-packed saltpans. And the 
footprints of sweat gave way to 
footprints of blood. 

Mimi drew in her breath between her teeth at the thought of 
the sick girl stumbling barefoot 



MARS CHILD 



75 



over the slicing, razor-edged stones. 
"I see her," Kandro whispered, 

still striding ahead. 

They raced a kilometer over the 
jagged rock and planed-off salt 
crust to the girl's body. She lay 
prone, with her right atrji flung up 



He glanced at Anna and straightened up quickly. "What is it?" 

Her face was withdrawn and intense, her head held back like an 
animal scenting the wind. She 
scanned the broken waste, and 
pointed a hesitant finger. "Out 




and pointing to the Rimrock Hills. 

Tony peeled back her eyelid and 
reached for the pulse. He turned 
to his bag, and Anna — blessed 
Anna — was already getting out the 
hypodermic syringe. 

"Adrenalin?" 

He nodded. Swiftly and efficiently, she prepared the hypo and handed it to him. He bent over the girl 
busily, then sat back to wait. 



there — it's that way — moving a 
little." 

Kandro was on his way before 
she stopped speaking. 

Stillman shaded his eyes and 
peered. "A rock in the heat haze," 
he pronounced finally. "Nothing 
alive." 

' Tony saw Anna shake her 
head in a small involuntary disagreement. 




 



THEY stood and waited in a 
tense small circle until Jim 
reached the spot. He looked down 
and they saw him hesitate, then 
move on with the same determined 
stride. Gracey lit out after him. 
Mimi murmured approval. There 
was no telling what rCandro might 
Jo in his present mood. 

A barely audible noise from the 
ground, and Tony was on his knees 
beside Joan. Her eyes went wide 
open, shining with an inner glory 
that was unholy in the dirt-streaked, 
bloodstained dead white of her 
face. She smiled as a child might 
smile, with perfect inner composure; she was pleased with herself. 

"Joan," the doctor said, "can 
you talk?" 

"Yes, of course. " But she 
couldn't. She only mouthed the 
words. 

"Does it hurt any place?" 

She shook her head, or started 
to, but when she had turned it to 
one side she lacked the strength to 
bring it back. "No." This time she 
forced a little air through to sound 
the word. 

She was dying and he knew it. 
If it were only the heart, he might 
have been "able to save her. But her 
body had been punished too much; 
it had given up. The water and 
the air that kept it alive were spent. 
Her body was a dead husk in 
which, for a moment, abetted by 
the little quantity of adrenalin, her 
heart and brain refused to die. 

He had to decide. They needed 
/ 

MARS CHILD 



what information she might have. 
She needed every bit of. energy she 
had, to live out what minutes were 
left. The minutes didn't matter, he 
told himself. 

He knew, even as he made up 
his mind, that this, like the ghost 
baby, would haunt him all his life. 
If he were wrong, *if she had any 
chance to live, he was committing 
murder. But another life hung in 
the balance too. 

"Listen to me, Joan." He put 
his mouth close to her face. "Just 
say yes or no. Did you see somebody take the Kandros' baby?" 

"Yes." She smiled up at him 
beattfically. 

"Do you know who it was?" 

"Yes — no — I saw — " 

"Don't try to talk. You saw the 
kidnaper clearly?" 

"Yes." 

"Then it was someone you don't 
know?" 

"No — yes — " 

"I'll ask it differently. Was it a 
stranger?" 

"Yes." She looked doubtful. 

"Anyone from the Colony?" 

"No." 

"A man?" 

"No — maybe." 

"A woman ?" 

"No." 

"Someone from Pittco?" 

She didn't answer. Her eyes 
were staring at her arm. The doctor had rolled her over, and the 
arm was at her side, stretched out. 
She let out a weird cry of fury and 

77 



frustration. Tony watched and listened, puzzled, till Anna bent over. 

"It's all right, Joan," she said 
softly. "You showed us. We saw 
the way it pointed. Jim is going 
that way now." 

The girl 's eyes rel ax cd , an d 
once again the dreadful light of 
joy shone from them. 

"Love me," she said distinctly. 
"I helped finally. Tony — " 

He bent over. She was trailing 
off again, less breath with each 
word. She might have minutes left, 
or seconds. 

"Nobody — believed — me or— 
them — it was — " 

She stopped, gasping, and the 
cjuiet smile of content gave way to 
a twisted grin of amusement. 
"Brownie," she said, and said no 
more. 

ii 

rpONY closed her eyes and 
X looked up to Anna's serene 
face. He saw that they were alone 
with the body of the dead girl. 

"Where — ?" He got to his feet, 
carefully dulling sensation, refusing to feci anything. 

"Over there." She pointed to 
where two figures stooped over 
something on the ground. Farther 
off, Kandro's tall figure, still resolutely facing toward the hills, was 
being restrained by a smaller man 
— Joe Gracey? That meant it was 
Mimi and Harve close by. 

"They found something?" 



"Somebody," she corrected, and 
couldn't control a small shudder. 

Tony started forward. "You 
better stay with Joan,' ' he said 
with difficulty, hating to admit any 
weakness in her. "I'll call you if — 
if we need you for anything." 

"Thank you." She was more 
honest about it than he could be. 

They saw him coming twenty 
meters off. 

"It's Graham," Mimi called. 
"The lying bastard steals babies 
too!" Harve spat out in disgust. 

"He looks bad," Mimi said 
quietly. "We didn't touch him. We 
were waiting for you." 

"Good." The doctor bent down 
and felt along the torso for broken 
bones. Carefully, he rolled the 
writer over. 

Graham's puffed eyes opened. 
Through broken lips with dried 
blood crusted on them he rasped 
jeeringly: "Come back to finish the 
job? God damned cowards. Sneak 
up on a man. God damned cowards!" 

"None ot our people did this to 
you," Tony said steadily. His 
hands ran over the writer's battered 
head and neck. The left clavicle 
was fractured, his nose was broken, 
his left eardrum had been ruptured 
by blows. 

"Let's get him back to the hospital," he said. "Harve, tell the 
radio shack to raise Marsport. Get 
Bell. Tell him we need that Bloodhound. Tell him I will not take no 
for an answer."

CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO 

IN AWKWARD silence the little 
procession walked along the 
Colony street, Kandro and Stillman 
together, carrying the writer, and 
Tony bearing the dead girl in his 
arms. The news had gotten around. 
Lab work seemed once again to 
have stopped completely. 

They escaped the heartsick stares 
of the colonists only when they 
entered Tony's hut-and-hospital. 
He deposited Joan there, on his 
own bed. It was still rumpled -from 
Graham's brief occupancy the night 
before. They settled the writer on 
the hospital table. With Anna's 
help, he removed the torn and 
bloody clothing from Graham's 
body. 

"If you don't need us for anything, Tony, I think we better get 
going," Mimi said. "We ought to 
stop in and see Polly." 

"Sure. Go ahead — oh , wait a. 
minute." Jim Kandro turned from 
his fixed spot in the doorway to 
listen. 

Tony beckoned to the blackhaired 
Lab administrator to the other side 
of the room. 

"Slimi," he said in an undertone, "you ought to know that 
Polly has a gun. I'm not sure 
whether Jim knows it or not. You 
might want it if you're going out 
again. Anyhow, somebody ought to 
get it out of there." 

She nodded. "Where is it?" 

"'Used to be in the baby's crib, 



but I think I talked her out of that. 
Don't know now." 
- "Okay, I'll find it. I think we 
better take it along. Oh — I'll send 
Hank back here." 

He was thoughtful. "Anna." She 
looked up. Her face was set and 
miserable. "Are you going out with 
the search party?" he asked, an 
innocent c|uestion to the others who 
listened, with a world of agonizing ■ 
significance for Anna. 

"I — isn't Nick picking the people to go?" 

"I thought you might want to 
go. If you're sticking around, yon* 
can handle Hank, can't you?" 

"Oh, yes," she said eagerly. "I'd 
be much more useful that way, 
wouldn't I?" 

He shrugged and tried to figure 
it out: she was perfectly willing to 
stay here in the hospital, to expose 
herself to Graham's physical pain 
and Hank's inevitable agony. But 
she was afraid to go out after the 
baby. Why? 

Later, he decided, he could talk 
to her. He went briskly back to the 
table and began his examination 
of Graham. The writer was a mass 
of bruises from his chest up; he 
cursed feebly when the doctor felt 
for fractures. Tony set the collar 
bone and shot him full of sedation. 
"Your left eardrum is ruptured," 
he said coldly. "An operation can 
correct that on Earth." 

"You bust 'em, somebody else 
fixes 'cm," Graham muttered. 

"Think what you want." He 



MARS CHILD 



pushed the wheeled table over to 
the high bed Polly had occupied 
j tist a few days earlier. 

Graham groaned involuntarily as 
Tony shifted his shoulder. The doctor cased up. What for? he 
stormed at himself. Why should I 
be gentle with the dirty sneak? He 
glanced hastily at Anna and caught 
the half-smile on her face as she 
pulled the covers over the writer. 

"I'm going in the other room, 
Graham," Tony said. "You can call 
me if you need me." 

"Sure," Graham told him. "I'll 
call you soon as I feel ready for 
.mother beating. I love it." 

rpONY didn't answer. In the 
X other room, he sat down and 
faced Anna intently. "Do you 
know whether any of our people 
could have done that to him?" 

"They aren'r haters," she said 
slowly. "If they were, they wouldn't be here. Someone might fly into 
a rage and break his jaw, but methodical punishment like that — 
no." 

"Ill tell you what it reminds me 
of. Big Ginny." 

"She was killed." 

"She was beaten up, though that 
wasn't what killed her." 1 

"Does it have anything to do 
with Pittco?" Anna asked, "Why 
should they beat Graham? Why 
should they have beaten that woman ?" 

"I don't know." He managed a 
feeble grin. "You know that." 



He lowered his voice. "Can you 
'hear' him?" 

"He's in a lot of pain. Shock's 
worn off. And he hates us. God, he 
hates us. I'm glad he hasn-t got a 
gun." 

"He's got a by-line. That's just 
as good." 

"Evidently that just occurred to 
him. Can he hear us ia there? He's 
gloating now. It must be a fantasy 
about what he's going to do to us." 

"Hell, we're through anyway. 
What difference does it make? All 
I want now is to find Sunny and 
get off this damned planet and 
give up trying. I'm sick of it." 

"You're not even kidding yourself,' ' she said gently. "How do 
you think you can fool me?" 

"All right,'' he said. "So you 
think my heart is breaking because 
Sun Lake's washed up. What good 
is it going to do me? Anna, will I 
be seeing you back on Earth? I 
want us. to stay teamed up. When 
I go into practice — " 

The woman winced and stood 
up. She closed the door to the hospital. "He was listening," she said. 
"He let out a blast of derision that 
rattled my skull when he heard you 
talk about going into practice on 
Earth." 

Tony pulled her down beside 
him, and held her quietly again* I 
his chest. "Ansie," he said once, 
softly, "my poor sweet Ansie/' He 
kissed her hair, and they sat very 
still until Hank knocked on the 
door.

ii 

HANK stared at his wife's body, 
refusing to believe what hesaw. 

"She didn't feel much," Tony 
tried to explain. "Just a bad moment, maybe, when her heart gave 
out. She couldn't have felt anything, or she'd never have gotten 
so far," 

"We were there at the end," 
Anna reminded the young man. 
"She was — she was very happy. 
She wanted to be useful more than 
anything else in the world. You 
know that, don't you? And in the 
end she was. She loved you very 
much, too. She didn't want you to 
be unhappy." 

"What did she say?" Hank 
wouldn't tear his eyes from the 
bed. He stood and stared ceaselessly, as if another moment of looking would show him some fallacy, 
some error. 

"Did she really say that, about 
loving me?" 

"She said — " Anna hesitated, 
then went on firmly. "She said, 
'Tell Hank I want him to be happy 
all the time.' I heard her," she answered Tony's look of surprise. It 
wasn't much of a lie. 

"Thank you. I — '* He sat on the 
bed beside his wife, his hand caressing the face stained with blood 
and dust. 

Tony turned and left the room. 
In the hospital, Graham was asleep 
or unconscious again. Tony went 



back to his own chair in the living 
room. 

There were so many hints, so 
many leads, so many parts of the 
picture. Somehow it all went together. He tried to concentrate, but 
his thoughts kept wandering, into 
the hospital where the writer lay 
beaten as Big Ginny had been 
beaten; into the bedroom, where 
Joan lay dead of — of Mars; where 
Anna was comforting the young 
man who would never realize, if he 
was lucky, that he had killed Joan 
himself as surely as if he had 
throttled her. 

The last thing she said before 
she died! Tony snorted. The last 
thing she said, with that glorious 
light in her eyes, and a grin of delight on her face -was "Brownie!" 

And there it was ! 

Within a few seconds' time 
■everything raced through li s mind, 
all the clues, the things that fitted 
together — Big Ginny, and Graham's story, Sunny and the mask 
and Joan's dying words. Everything ! 

He jumped up in furious excitement. „ 

No, not everything, he realized. 
Not the marcaine. That didn't fit. 

He paced the length of the room, 
and turned to find Anna standing 
in the bedroom door. 

"Did you call?" she asked. 
"What happened ?" 

He smiled. He went over and 
pushed the door closed behind her 
"Ansie," he said, "you just don't

know how lucky you are to have a 
big, strong, intelligent man like me. 
When are we going to get married?" 

She shook her head. 

"Not until you tell me what it's 
all about."

HAMILTON BELL 
PLANETARY AFFAIRS 

COMMISSIONER 

rnONY read through the formal 
JL message sheet, then the note 
attached to it: 

"That's the master's voice up 
there. The PAC radio up in Marsport told me, on the side, that the 
old man doesn't believe a word of 
yoiw story. If the baby really is 
missing, he figures 'that Markie 
Mama did it in.' Graham really 
fixed us. I hope you're taking good 
care of him. If you get him back 
in shape, I won't feel so bad about 
taking a crack at him myself. 
Harve." 

The doctor smiled briefly, then 
asked Tad Campbell, who was 
waiting to take his answer back to 



the radio shack; "Did Mimi Jonathan see this?" 

"No. It just came in. Harve 
wants to know what answer to 
send." 

CANTTRELLA and Gracey were 
out with the search party too, 
Tony realized. That left the decision squarely up to him. 

He scribbled a note: "Harve, try 
this one on the commish. REQUEST USE PAC FACILITIES 
TO TRACK VICIOUS ATTACKER OF OUR GUEST, DOUGLAS 
GRAHAM. That ought to get us 
every tin soldier on the planet, and 
old man Bell himself heading the 
parade. Graham as victim gives him 
an out, too; he can call it intercolony. Get hot. We need that Bloodhound. Tony." 

When the boy was gone, Tony 
paced nervously around the living 
room, started to heat water for 
"coffee," and decided he didn't 
want it. 

There was an almost empty 
bottle of liquor on the floor near 
the table — Graham's. The doctor 
reached for it and drew back. It 
wasn't the right time or the right 
bottle. 

He headed for the bedroom door, 
and remembered that Joan's body 
was still occupying the bed. He 
peered into the 'hospital; Gfaham 
was still sleeping. Nothing to do 
but sit and wait, and think it out 
all over again. It checked every 
time: — but it couldn't be right. 



82 




 



He hadn't told Anna yet. When 
you came light down to it, the 
whole thing was too far-fetched; 
he wouldn't believe it himself, if 
somebody else had proposed it. 

But it checked all the way every 
time. 

He got up again and hunted 
through his meager stack of onionskin volumes and scientific journals. Nothing there, but Joe Gracey ought to know. When the 
search party came back . . . ■ 

May-be they'd find the baby and 
the kidnaper ; maybe he never 
would tell — or have to tell — anybody his crackpot theory. He decided to make the "coffee" after 
all, and wished he hadn't sent 
Anna and Hank back to stay with 
Polly, but Gladys had been frantic 
and frightened when she buzzed 
him. He couldn't expect the child 
to handle a hysterical woman by 
herself. 

The doctor poured his "coffee" 
and drank it slowly, not letting 
himself go to the intercom. Polly 
and Hank could help each other 
now; it worked that way. And 
Anna was better for them than he 
would be himself. Somebody had 
to stay with Graham. He got up 
and paced restlessly into the hospital room again. The writer stirred 
and moaned as the door opened, 
but that was all. 

It was more than an hour since 
Tad had left. Why no reply from 
Harve ? 

Tony went to the front door, 



opened it and peered up the street, 
out over the housetops to the landing field. Nothing in sight. He 
turned to go back in, and out of 
the corner of his eye saw them 
rounding the curve of the street. 

Gracey, Mimi, Juarez, and then 
Kandro, taking each step reluctantly, his heart back in the hills, while 
Nick Cantrella and Sam .Flexner, 
one on each side, urged him forward. Tony's heart sank; there was 
no mistaking defeat, 

ii 

■**T'M sure," Mimi said steadily, 

JL "we heard him cry. Just for 
a minute. Then it was as if someone had clapped a hand over his 
mouth. Tony, we can't wait. We've 
got to get him out right away." 

"What about the other caves?" 

"We tried them all around," 
Gracey said. "Five or six on each 
side and a couple up above. But 
every one of those fissures narrows 
down inside the hill the same way. 
We couldn't get through, I don't 
sec how the kidnapers did, either." 

"How about the other side ?' ' 
Tony asked. ' ' Someone could go 
around with a half-track and take 
a look." 

"We thought of it," Mimi said 
sharply. "Nick got Pittco on the 
transceiver. Mister Hackenburg was 
so sorry. Mister Reynolds was away, 
and he didn't have the authority 
himself to permit us to search on 
their ground. He was so sorry!" 



MARS CHILD 



83 



SHE stood up abruptly, and 
turned to the wall, not quite 
quickly enough. Tony saw her 
brush at her eyes before she turned 
back and said throatily; "Well, 
little men, what now? Where do 
we go from here?'* 

"We wait," Joe Gracey said 
helplessly. "Wc wait for Bell to 
answer us. We wait for Reynolds 
to get back. What else can we do?" 
"Nothing, I guess. We left half 
• a dozen men out there," Mrmi told 
the doctor. "They're watching, and 
they have the transceiver. I guess 
Joe's right. Wc wait." 

Silence, and Tony tried to find 
a way to say what he had to say. 
They couldn't just wait, not while 
he knew something to try. The 
baby might be all right, but maybe 
they would get there just one minute too late. 

He turned to Gracey. 
"Joe, what do you know about 
lethal genes?" 

"Huh?" The agronomist looked 
up, dazed, shook his head, and repeated without surprise at the 
irrelevent question, "Lethal genes?" 
He stopped and considered, mentally tubulating his information. 
"Well, they're recessives that — " 

"No, I know what they are," 
Tony stopped him. "I thought I 
heard you say something about 
them the other day. Didn't you 
say you thought you'd hit on some 
that were visible on Mars?" 

Anna drifted in, with Hank at 
her heels, and they went straight 



through, into the room beyond 
where Joan still lay. 

"Oh, yes," Gracey said. "Very 
interesting stuff. Come out to the 
Lab when you have the time, and 
I'll show you. We — " 

Mimi jumped up. "What are 
you gabbling about?'' she demanded. "This is an emergency! We 
have to find some way to rescue 
that baby!" 

"I'm sorry, Mimi." Gracey was 
bewildered. "What's wrong anyway? Tony asked a perfectly innocent question, and t answered him 
when we'd all agreed that wc had 
nothing to do but sit around and 
wait. Why not use the time?" 

Abruptly, Tony made up his 
mind. It was up to him now. And 
to Anna. He got up and called her 
from the bedroom, led her outside, 
into the street in front of the 
house, where they were out of earshot of all the others. 

"Well?" She smiled up at him. 
"Will you stop feeling sorry for 
me and tell me what you're sorry 
about?" 

"In a minute. Anna, last night 
when we took the mask off Sunny 
— when you fainted — how did it 
feel?" 

"I told you." 

"Yes, you said it was very 
strong, stronger than you thought 
a baby could— feel. But was it just 
stron gcr or was the re something 
different?" 

"That's hard to say. I was — 
well, I was all worn out and upset. 



81 




 



It might have been different, but I 
don't know how. I'm not even sure 

it was." 

She looked up at him sharply. 
•Why?" 

"It checks," he said to himself. 
"Listen, Ansie, there's a job to be 
done. A tough job. A job nobody 
can do but you. It may — hurt you. I 
don't know. I don't even know if 
it will work. It's a crazy theory 
I've got, so crazy I don't even want 
to explain it to you. But if I'm 
right, you're the only person who 
can do it." He stopped. "Anna, did 
you hear what Joan's last word 
really was? She said, 'Brownie.'" 

He looked down into frightened 
dark eyes. 

"Tony, ihere aren't any Brownies, arc tfaefe ?" 

"You mean do I believe there 
are? No, I don't. But I do think 
there's something." 

"You want me to go out there 
and listen?" 

"Yes. But that's only part of it. 
I wouldn't let you go alone; if you 
do go, I'll be with you — if that 
helps any. But I want to go into 
the cave where they heard the baby 
and sec what we can find." 

"No!" The cry was torn from 
her. "I didn't mean that," she 
caught herself. "It's just — oh, 
Tony, I'm afraid." 

"We've got to And out. Ansie, 
we've got to find out." 

"The Bloodhound?" she asked 
desperately. "Can't you track them 
with the Bloodhound?" 



"Bell hasn't answered us. How 
long can we wait?" 

She stood silent for a moment, 
then turned her face up to his, 
serenely quiet now and trusting. 

"All right," she said at last. 
"All right, Tony, if you say it has 
to be done." 

"I'll be there with you," he 
promised. 

m 

MIMI and Joe didn't understand, and Tony didn't try to 
explain. He simply repeated that 
he had an "idea;" he wanted, to go 
out, with Anna, to the cave where 
the baby's cry had been heard. 

He left careful instructions about 
the care of Graham if he should 
awake, and about Hank, Polly, and 
Jim, all three of whom were too 
upset to be left to themselves. 

A ten minute ride on the halftrack and they were within the 
shadow of the Rimrocks. The drifting stench of Pittco's refineries on 
the other side began to reach them; 
then the ground was too rocky to 
go on. Tony stopped the machine 
and they got out. Farther up the 
face of the nearest hill, they could 
make out the figures of the five 
who had remained on guard. 

One of them came running — 
F.lcxner, the chemist. "They said 
on the transceiver you were coming,' ' he told Anna and Tony. 
"What's your idea? We're going 
nuts si tting aroun d waiting. Ted 



MARS CHILD

thought he heard Sunny cry again 
but nobody else did." 

"I just wanted to see if I could 
turn up anything," Tony told him 
"We're g°' n £ into the cave." 

TOGETHER they walked out of 
the sunlight into the seven 
foot opening in the hard rock. One 
of the guards would have preceded them, but Anna firmly refused. 
A chalk mark along the wall, 
drawn by the others when they left 
the cave, was guide enough. 

They followed the white line in 
and down some fifty meters, then 
fifty more along a narrowing lefthand branch, and then a hundred 
meters, left again and narrowing, 
to another fork. Both the branches 
were too small for an adult to 
squeeze through. The chalk line 
pointed into the right-hand cranny. 

That was as far as they could 
go. They stood at the narrow opening, listening. 

There was nothing to hear, no 
sound at all in the rock-walled stillness except their own breathing 
and the tiny rustling of their hands 
along rough alien stone. 

They waited, Tony's eyes fixed 
on Anna's face. "He tried to silence 
his thoughts as he could his voice, 
but doubts tore at him. He turned, 
finally, to the one certainty he 
knew, and concentrated on Anna 
and her alone: on his love for her, 
her love for him. 

"I hear something," she whispered at last. "Fear — mostly fear, 

86 



but eagerness, too. They are not 
afraid of us. I think they like us. 
They're afraid of — it's not clear — 
of people?" 

She fell silent again, listening. 

"People." She nodded her head 
emphatically. "They want to talk 
to us, Tony, but — I don't know." 
Her brow furrowed in concentration and she sat down suddenly on 
the hard rock floor, as though the 
physical exertion of standing were 
more than she could bear. 

"Tony, go and tell the guards 
to go away," she said at last. 

"No," he said firmly. 

"Go ahead. Please. Hurry. They 
are trying — " Abruptly, she 
stopped concentrating on the distance. "You spoiled it," she said 
bitterly. "You frightened them." 

"How?" 

"You didn't t rust them. You 
thought they'd hurt me." 

"Ansie, how can we trust them? 
How can I leave you here alone 
and send the guards away? Don't 
you see I can't take that risk?" 

"You made me come here," she 
said tiredly. "You said I was the 
one who could do the job. I'm trying to do it. Please go now and 
tell the guards to leave. Tell them 
to get out of range — down at the 
bottom of the hill, maybe as far 
away as the half-track. Please, 
Tony, do as I say." 

"All right." But he was still 
hesitant. "Anna, who are they?" 

"I — " The bitterness left her 
face. "Brownies," she said. 


 



' 'But that's not — I'm sorry. I 
didn't mean tso feel angry and frustrated. What docs the -word mean ?' 

"They're different." 

"Like Sunny?" 

"Not exactly." She made a small 
useless gesture with her hands. 
"More — distinct. No, maybe you're 
tight. I think they're like him, only 
older." 

"How many are there?" 

"Quite a few. Too many for me 
to count. One of them is doing all 
the — talking." 

''Talking?" Yes, that was part of 
what had bothered him. " Ansie, 
how can you understand so clearly? 
You told me you can't do that. 
You didn't know what Graham was 
angry about. How do you know 
what they're afraid of?" 

"Tony, I don't know. I can understand, that's all, and I'm sure 
it's right, and I know they're not 
tricking us. Now please, please go 
and tell the guards." 

He went. 

CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR 

**T/^EEP him away from me!" 

X\. Graham screamed. 

Mimi raced through Tony's living room into the hospital half of 
the hut. 

It was Hank, standing rigidly 
still, glaring at the writer. "You 
don't understand about Mars." 
Hank was saying in a hard monotone. "You never saw the Rimrocks 
when there was just enough light 



to tell them from the sky, or waJked 
a hundred miles in the desert 
watching the colors change every 
minute." 

"Mrs. Johnson, get him out of 
here. He's crazy." 

Mimi took Hank by the arm. 
"I'm not crazy," he said. "Those 
boomers at .Pittco, this writer here, 
Bell and his soldiers, Brenner and 
his factory, they're crazy. They're 
trying to cheapen Mars." 

Hysteria, thought Mimi. She'd 
coped with enough cases of it when 
she'd bossed girls at desks, as far 
as the eye could see, on the 76th 
floor of the American Insurance 
Groups Building. 

"Radcliff!" she said. 

There was a savage whip-crack in 
her voice. 

He turned to her, startled. "I 
wasn't going to hurt him," he said 
confusedly. 

Get him to cry. Break him. Until then, there's no knowing what 
will happen. "Your poor wife's lying in there," she said with mea>ured nastiness, "and you find time 
to brawl with a sick man." 

"I didn't mean anything like 
that," he protested. 

Still unbroken. "Get into tlu 
bedroom," she said. "Sit there. 
That's the least you can do." 

He walked heavily into the room 
where his wife's body lay and sheheard him drop into a plastic chair. 

"Thanks, Mrs. Johnson," said 
Graham painfully. "He was spoiling for a fight." 



MARS CHILD 



87 



"Mrs. Jonathan," she corrected. 
'And I don't want your "thanks." 

She turned and rattled through 
drawers of medications, hoping 
she'd find something she could give 
Hank. She didn't know what to use 
or how much. She slapped the 
drawer shut and was angry with 
Tony and Anna for not being there 
when she needed them. 

She stalked into the bedroom 
and stared at Hank without showing any pity. He was looking dully 
at I he w all, a spot over the bed on 
which Joan's broken body lay. No 
shakes- no tears, unbroken still. 
But she couldn't bring herself to 
lash him further and precipitate 
the Emotional crisis. 

She went back into Tony's living room and threw herself into a 
chair. She'd hear it anything happened. Mrs. J., the terror of auditing, Old Eagle-eye, and a few less 
complimentary things when the 
girls were talking between t hebooths in one of the 76th-floor 
johns. Efficiency bonuses year after 
year, even bad years, and that meant 
you were an old witch. She must 
be out of practice, or getting soft, 
she decided harshly, if she couldn't 
handle an absurdly simple little 
thing like this. 

We ought to have Tony tram 
somebody besides Anna, she 
thought. There's Hctrve, but he 
only knows radio-health. And then 
she remembered that it didn't matter; Sun Lake wouldn't last that 
long. 



SHE heard a plane coming in at 
the landing field and wondered whose. Hank stirred in the 
bedroom and she tensed, but then 
she heard the creak of his big body 
slumping back into the chair. He 
wouldn't break. He had too much 
of the old Marsmah in him, the 
tough old breed, iln the old days, 
if she'd been assigning a pair of 
girls to an audit program, she 
wouldn't have made a match like 
Hank and Joan- — -one starry-eyed 
and on fire for an ideal; -the other 
solidly and physically in love with 
far places for their farness and mystery. But it had worked here and 
they'd had their measure of happiness before they had to taste their 
measure of hell. 

Hank should have come earlier. 
He should have been one of the 
first, eating out of cans, mapping 
and mining, bearded to his waist, 
inarticulate, but sure about what 
he wanted. Joan should have come 
later. She should have been an 
immigrant after the colony had 
licked Mars medicine, while there 
still was grinding work and sacrifice enough to please the most impassioned, but not so much that a 
frail body would crumple under it. 

But there wasn't going to be 
any "later," of course. It was hard 
to get used to that realization. 

She got up and had a drink of 
water from the wall canteen, and 
then, defiantly, another, because it 
didn't matter now. She felt like 
taking on the world for Sun Lake.



 



Joan must have felt like that. Their 
water supply was scanty, but it was 
water — not the polluted fluid of 
Earth, chlorinated to the last potable degree. 

THE intercom in the bedroom 
buzzed. She walked in and 
picked it up, glanced at Hank, still 
numbly staring. 

"Hello, Mimi." It was Harve. 
"Answer from Bell. Quote: 'RE 
ASSAULT ON DOUGLAS GRAHAM I AND DETAIL OF 
GUARDS WILL TAKE ACTION 
THIS MATTER. REQUEST USE 
PAC FACILITIES DENIED. 
HAMILTON BELL" et cetera. 
What do you figure he'll do — try 
and pin the Graham slugging on 
us too?" 

"I don't know," she said. "It 
doesn't matter. What plane was 
that?" 

"Brenner's. Snooty bastard didn't 
even check in with us. Just sat right 
down on the field.' 

"He might as well. He'll own it 
soon enough." 

She heard Harve dear his throat 
embarrassedly. "Well, I guess 
that's all." 

"Goodby," she agreed, hanging 
up. She shouldn't have said that; 
she was supposed to pretend that 
while there was life there was hope. 

"Hank?" she asked gently and 
inquiringly. 

He looked up. Tm all right, 
thanks." 

He wasn't, but there was noth


ing she could do. She looked 
through the door to the hospital. 
Graham seemed to be dozing. She 
sat down in the living room again. 

Brenner came in without knocking. "They told me you were here, 
Mrs. Jonathan. I wonder if we 
could go to your office in the Lab. 
I want to talk business." 

"I'm staying here," she said 
shortly. "If you want to talk here, 
I'll listen." 

Brenner shrugged and sat down. 
"Do we have privacy?" 

"There's a boy in the next room 
going crazy with grief over his 
dead wife — and over the prospect 
of leaving Mars. And there's a badly beaten man sleeping in the hospital quarters." 

The drug manufacturer lowered 
his voice. "Rotative privacy," he 
said. "Mrs. Jonathan, you have the 
only business head in the Colony." 
He opened his briefcase on the 
tabic and edged the corner of a 
sheaf of bills from one of' its 
pockets. The top one was a thousand dollars. He didn't look at it, 
but rifned the sheaf with his thumb, 
slowly, like a gambler manipulating 
a deck of cards. They were all 
thousands, and there were over one 
hundred of them. 

"It's going to be very hard on 
some of the colonists, I'm afraid," 
he said conversationally. 

"You have no idea." 

"It needn't be that hard on all 
of them." His thumb flipped the 
big bills. "Your colony is facing 



MARS CHILD 



an impossible situation, Mrs. Jonathan. Let's not mince words; it's a 
matter of bankruptcy and forced 
sale. I'm in a position to offer you 
a chance to retreat in good order, 
with some money in your pockets." 

"That's very kind of you, Mr. 
Brenner. I'm not sure I understand." 

"Please," he smiled, "let's not 
be coy. I'm being perfectly candid 
with you. If it comes to a farced 
sale, I intend to bid as high as 
necessary; I need this property. But 
I'm not a man who believes in 
leaving things to chance. "Why 
shouldn't you sell out to me now? 
Jt would save yourselves the humiliation of bankruptcy, and I . believe everyone concerned would 
benefit financially." 

"You realize I'm not in a position to close any deals, Mr. Brenner?" she asked. 

"Yes, of course. You have a 
council in charge here, don't you? 
And you're a member. You could 
plead, my case with them." 
"I suppose I could." 
"All right." He smiled again, 
and his thumb continued to riffle 
the pile of bills. "Then I have to 
plead it first with you. Why should 
you stay on Mars ? In the hope that 
'something' will turn up? Believe 
me, It will not. Your commercial 
standing will be gone. Nobody 
would dream of extending credit 
to the people who were six months 
behind on their deliveries. Nothing 
iv'ttl turn up, Mrs. Jonathan." 



"What if the stolen marcaihe 
turns up?" 

"Then, of course 1 — " He smiled 
and shrugged. 

MIMI read a momentary alarm 
in his face. For the first time 
since the crisis she entertained the 
thought that it was not a frameup. 

She pressed harder. "What if 
we're just waiting to hand Bell the 
hundred kilos and the thief?" 

Brenner turned inscrutable again. 
"Then something else will happen. 
And if the Colony survives that, 
something else again." He quickly 
denied the implication of sabotage 
by adding: "You have a fundamentally untenable financial situation here. Insufficient reserves, 
foggy motives- — what businessman 
can trust you when he knows that 
your Lab production workers might 
walk out one fine day and stay out ? 
They aren't bound by salaries but 
by idealism." 

"It's kept us going." 
"Until now. Come, Mrs. Jonathan, I said I wanted an advocate 
in the Council." He thumbed out 
the deck of bills all the way from 
Hie pocket in the opened briefcase. "You have a business head. 
You know that if you do produce 
my marcaine and the thief, Mr. 
Graham's little story — which I read 
with great interest — will be another bad hump to get over. There 
will be more." 

He meant two things : more 
humps, and more sheafs of thou



 



sand dollar bills for her if she took 
the bribe. 

Mimi smiled without moving a 
1 ouscie ol her face. It had been a 
long time since she had talked this 
kind of talk, but she still knew 
how. The smile stayed inside her 
head, her face displayed only the 
most casual interest. 

"Are you offering to buy the 
Colony, Mr. Brenner? Would you 
care to name a price?" 

"What are you asking?" he countered. 

Ob, no, she thought, you're not 
getting away with that. 

"All right, we'll play it your 
way," she said. "Name two prices. 
You want to buy my services, too, 
don't you?" 

"Whatever gives you that notion? I'm not trying to bribe you, 
Mrs. Jonathan." He picked up the 
sheaf of bills and placed them in 
front of her. "There's a hundred 
thousand here, I can bring another 
— say another four hundred thousand — for a down payment, whenever you say. My price for the Colonly," he added distinctly, "is exactly five million." 

"Plus your down payment?" she 
asked, amused. 

"That's right." 

"That would just about pay all 
our fares back to Earth. We'll 
smash the Lab to bits before we 
let you get it for any such price." 

"You'll rot in prison if you do," 
Brenner said easily. "There is an 
injunction on file at Marsport 



signed by Commissioner Bell restraining you from any such foolishness. An act of contempt would 
mean imprisonment for all of you. 
I mean all." 

"No such paper has been served 
on us." 

"The Commissioner assured me 
it had been served. I don't doubt 
his word. Not many people, including appeals judges, would 
doubt his word either." 

MIMI didn't dare answer this 
display of force. She set her 
teeth and thought about five million — and five hundred thousand. 
Passage home, the respectability of 
having sold instead of going bankrupt, maybe the chance of another 
charter and another try — 

"It'll have to be put into form 
by the Council and voted on by 
the entire Colony," she said painfully. "You wanted an udvam e. 
Take your money back; I'm not for 
sale. But I will plead your case if 
you'll make it ten million. God 
knows, it's a bargain. There's absolutely no depreciation on the Lab 
to be figured. It's better now than 
it ever was. Maintenance has always been top-level. Better than 
anything you'll ever be able to find 
in industry." 

"Five million and five hundred 
thousand was my offer. I'm not the 
Croesus uninformed people take-mc 
for. I have my expenses on the 
marcaine distribution end, you 
know."

JTK)NY sweated out the time. 
JL Eight minutes creeping 
along the chalk line in the dark — 
he'd left the light with Anna. Five 
minutes scrabbling over the boulders at the cave opening on the 
face of the hill. Twelve long minutes talking the guards into leaving, 
and a painful tortured eternity — 
maybe another twelve minutes reentering the cave and tracing the 
chalk line by the dim light borrowed from Ted. 

Tony was sweating ice by the 
time the radiance from Anna's light 
came in view. He rounded the last 
curve in the winding passage, and 
something j umped up f rom the 
floor, straightened and stood, tense 
and watchful as the doctor. 

Anna, seated on the cold floor, 
laughed softly, melodiously. 

She was all right. Tony relaxed 
a little and instantly felt — something, a gentle stroking, a tentative 
touch, not on his head but in it. 
No menace, no danger. Friendship. 

The doctor stared across the cavern: leathery brown skin, barrel 
chest, big ears, skinny arms and 
legs; the height of a small man or 
a large boy; and — a telcpath. 

The friendly touch on his mind 
persisted through his quick distaste, 
his exultation, his eagerness. 

."Anna," very softly, "is it all 
right to talk?" 

"Not too loud. His ears are 
sensitive." 



"Who is he? Are there more? 
Does be have Sunny? Ask him 
that, Anna — ask him!" 

"A Brownie," she laughed again, 
joyously. "You told me that. There 
are four more down there, inside, 
with Sunny." 

"Is he all right ?" 

"Yes. They took him to help 
him, not to do any harm. He needed something, but I can't find out 
what." 

The Brownie squatted again on 
the floor beside Anna. Tony approached slowly and sat down next 
to them. 

He felt goose-flesh and memories of old nursery book horrors, 
but nothing happened. He forced 
himself to ask Anna: "What kind 
of thing?" 

"Something to eat, I think. 
Something like the first sip of water 
when you're thirsty, and as necessary as salt, and — good. Maybe 
like a vitamin, but it tastes wonderful." 

Tony ran through a mental cata. logue of biochemicals. But that was 
foolish; how could you tell what 
would taste good to anything as 
alien as a Brownie? 

"Have you tried sign language?" 
he asked Anna. 

"Where do you start ?" she 
shrugged. "You'd have to build up 
a whole set of symbols before you 
could get anything across . . . Tony, 
I'm sure we can get the baby back 
jf we just understand what it is he 
needs."

MARS CHILD 



THE doctor reached over, hesitated, and forced himself to 
tap the Brownie lightly on the 
shoulder. When he had the creature's attention, he whispered to 
Anna: "Tell him we're trying to 
find out -what it Is." He pointed to 
his own eyes. "Show us," he said 
to the creature, and tried to project 
the thought, the Image of seeing, 
as hard as he could. 

They kept repeating it with every 
possible combination of thought 
and act. Then, suddenly, the 
Brownie jumped and dashed off, 
down the tunnel. 

"Did he get the idea?" demanded Tony. "Is he coming back?" 

"It's all right," smiled Anna. 
"He understood." 

Si lence in the eerie place was 
almost unbearable. 

"Don't worry so, Tony," Anna 
said. "If you want to know, he almost scared the wits out of me, too. 
I was; sitting, trying to look down 
the little opening, and still — talking — to the ones down there, and 
he came up behind me. I was concentrating on them so I didn't hear 
him, either way." 

Tony sat back thoughtfully. It 
was all true then; his crazy theory 
was right — there were actually 
Brownies on Mars, a form of life 
so highly developed that It was 
telepathic, and with no lower lifeforms to have evolved from. Hc 
wondered if he had hit the right 
explanation, too, but there WAS no 
other explanation. 



The brownie was back, carrying 
something, a box. Large letters in 
black on the side read: 

DANGER 
SEALED MARCAINE 

CONTAINER 
Do Not Open Without 
Authorization 
Brenner Pharmaceutical Co. 

CHAPTER TWENTY-FIVE 

TONY helped Anna dismount 
from the half-track, with her 
valuable burden In her arms. She 
jounced Sunny happily, and cooed 
down at the pink face. The doctor 
didn't jounce his own burden; he 
lifted it down even more carefully 
than he had helped Anna. The marcaine box was tightly wrapped in 
his shirt and hers. They were counting on the several layers of cloth 
to trap escaping dust and protect 
them from marcaine jags, but the 
doctor still wasn't taking any 
chances on stirring up the contents 
of the half-full box. 

They cut across the bare land In 
back of the row of houses, heading 
toward the curved street near the 
Kandros". 

"Tony," Anna asked anxiously 
again, ''bow are we possibly going 
to explain it?" 

"I told you I don't know." He 
was only a little Irritable. They had 
the baby; they had the marcaine. 
"We'll have to talk to Mimi and 
Joe and Nick, and probably the 



94 




 



others too. We'll sec how it 
goes . . ." 

"No, 1 don't mean that," she 
stopped him. "I mean to Polly. 
And Jim. Jim isn't going to like 
it unless he hears the whole story, 
and I don't know if we ought 
to . . ." 

"Like it or not," Tony said 
briskly, "Kandro'll do what I tell 
him to. We'll have to tell them it's 
marcaine; I don't dare risk mislabeling the stuff. You'll have to 
blow some ampoules for it, I guess, 
and I'll figu re out some way of 
wetting it down and getting it into 
them. But you're right," he added, 
"if you .mean we shouldn't say any 
more than we have to just now." 

They stepped onto the packed 
dirt of the street and exit across to 
the Kandros'. 

Joe Gracey was sitting alone in 
the living room. 

"Praise God," he said quietly, 
an d called : ' 'Polly ! Jim J" The 
couple appeared, red-eyed, at the 
nursery door, saw their baby, and 
flew to him. 

"You gave him to. us again. 
Doc!" said Jim. "Thanks." 

Polly was more practical: "Has 
he eaten? Is he well? He looks all 
right, but — " 

"You can feed him in a minute. 
Now listen carefully. This young 
man of yours, you know, is special 
in some ways. He can take the 
Mars air and like it. It (urns out 
that there's something else he needs 
— something that's good for him 



and bad for other people, just like 
the Mars air. It's marcaine." 

Polly's face went white. Jim began a guffaw of unbelief that 
turn ed in to a f rown . He asked 
carefully; "How can that be, Doc? 
What is this all about? And who 
took him? We have a right to 
know." 

Anna came to Tony's rescue. 
"You're not going to know right 
now," she said tartly. "If you think 
that's hard on you, it's just too 
bad. You've got your baby back; 
now leave the doctor alone until 
he's ready to tell you more." 

Jim opened his mouth and shut 
it again. Polly asked only: "Doctor, 
are you sure?" 

"I'm sure. And it won't have 
anything like the effect on Sunny 
that it had on you. But it's real 
marcaine, all right, and he's got to 
have it or die." 

"Like OxEn ?" asked Kandro. 
"It's only fair in a way . , 

TONY ignored him.. "1 guess 
you're going to have to wean 
the baby after all, Polly," he said. 
"You can't keep taking marcaine 
for Sunny' s sake. But for now, I 
guess you might as well nurse him. 
Your milk still has marcaine in it." 

Kandro was still adjusting himself to the idea. "Sunny doesn't 
need OxEn, so he's got to take 
something else?" 

"Yes," Tony said, "like OxEn . . ." He broke off, and Anna 
spun toward him, her eyes wide.

Tli e d oc t or f orced his face in to 
calm lines. "I want to have a talk 
with Joe now. And Nick Cantrclla, 
Anna, will you see if you can get 
Nick on I lie intercom:'' Ask him to 
tome over here right away. I've got 
an idea."' 

[n (he living room, he told Gracey: "You won't have to keep an 
eye on them any more, Joe. But 
watch me — I feci like Alexander, 
Napoleon, Eisenhower, end the 
Great Cham all rolled into one." 

"You're certainly grinning like 
a lunatic," the agronomist agreed 
critically. "What's on your mind?" 

"Wait a minute . . . did you get 
him?" Tony asked as Anna came 
in to the room. 

"He's coming," she nodded. 
"Tony, what is it?" 

"I'll tell you both, soon," he 
promised. "Let's wait for Nick, so 
I won't have to repeat it." He paced 
restlessly around the room, thinking it through again. It ought to 
work; it ought to! 

WHEN Cantrella arrived, he 
turned on the two men. 
"Listen, both of yon!" He tried 
not to sound too eager. "If I 
handed you a piece of living tissue 
with a percentage of oxygen enzyme — and I don't mean traces, I 
mean a percentage — where would 
we stand in respect to . . ." He 
halted up the cautious complicated 
phraseology. "Hell, what I mean is, 
could we manufacture OxEn?" 
"The living virus?" Graccy 



asked. "Not crystalizcd OxEn 
processed for absorption?" 
"The living virus." 
"We'd be a damn sight better 
than half-way along the processing 
that the Kelscy people do in Louisville. They grow the first culturc 
from the Rosen batch, then they 
cull out all the competing enzymes, 
then they grow what's left and cull, 
for hundreds of stages, to get a 
percentage of the living virus to 
grow a pure culture they can crop 
and start crystalizing." 

"How about it, Nick?" Tony demanded. "Could the Lab swing a 
job of crystalizing a crop from that 
and processing it lor absorption?" 

"Sure," said Nick. "That's the 
easy part. I've been reading up on 
it since we talked about it before." 

"Look here," Graccy exploded, 
"where do you think you're going 
to get your living virus from? You 
have to keep getting it, you know. 
It always mutates under normal 
radiation sooner or later, and you 
have to start over again." 

"That's my end of the deal. I 
hive a hunch I can get it. Thanks, 
both of you." He went into the 
nursery and told Polly calmly: "Tin 
taking your youngster away again 
— just for a few minutes, though. 
I wan t to check h is 1 ungs in the 
hospital. Anna?" She was already 
taking the baby from Polly's arms. 
Tony picked up the wrapped ni.ircainc-box and started out. 

"Hey, Doc, what goes on?" Graccy demanded. 




 



He 'brushed past Nick and the 
puzzled agronomist. "Tell you 
later," he called back. 

On the street, Anna turned a 
worried face up to his. "Tony, 
what arc you doing? You Can't 
operate on a five-day-old baby . . . 
can you?" she finished, less certainly. "You seem so— so happy and 
sure of yourself." 

' ' I am, ' ' he said shortly, an d 
then relented enough to add: "The 
'operation,' if you want to call it 
that, won't hurt him." But he 
wouldn't say any more. 

MIMI and Brenner were in 
Tony's living room. The 
woman said hopelessly: "Hello, 
Tony, Mr. Brenner's made an offer 
— Oh! It's Sunny!" 

"Hello, Mimi," said Tony. 
"The youngster, eh?" Brenner 
said genially. "I've heard about 
him." 

With a brusque "Excuse me" to 
the drug manufacturer, Tony said 
to Anna in an undertone: "Rig the 
op table, sterilites on. Get out the 
portable biopsy constant-temperature bath and set the thermostat to 
Sunny's blood temperature. And 
call me." 

She nodded and went into the 
hospital with the baby. Tony 
dropped his bundle into his trunk 
and began to scrub up. 

"What's been going on, Mimi?" 
he asked. 

"Mr. Brenner's offered five million, five hundred thousand dollars 



for Sun Lake's assets. I said the 
Council would put it in formal 
shape and call a vote." 

The descent from his peak of 
inspiration was sickening. Nothing 
had changed, then, Tony thought. 

"Ready," Anna said at his side. 
He followed her silently into the 
hospital, slipped into his gloves 
and said: "Sterilize the Byers curette, third extension, and lubricate. 
Sterilize a small oral speculum." 
He spoke quietly. Graham was 
asleep in the bed across the room. 

Anna didn't move. "Anesthesia?" she asked. 

"None. We don't know their 
body-chemistry well enough." 

' 'No, Tony. Please, no !' ' 

He felt only a chill determination that he was going to salvage 
some of the wreckage' of Sun Lake, 
determination and more confidence 
than he knew he should feel. Anna 
turned, selected the instruments 
and slipped them into the sterilizer. 
The doctor stepped on the pedal 
that turned on the op lights. 

Anna put the speculum into his 
hand and he clamped open Sonny's 

mouth. The prompt wail of protest 
turned to a strangled cry as the 
sinuous shaft of the Byers curette 
slid down the trachea into the left 
bronchus. One steady hand guided 
the instrument, while the other 
manipulated the controls from a 
bulb at its base. 

"Hold him," Tony growled as 
Anna's hands weakened and the 
woman swayed. Bronchus, bronchia, 



MARS CHILD 



97 



bronchilc, probing and withdrawing at resistances — and there it 
was. A pressure on the central control that uncovered the razor-sharp 
little spoon at the tip of the flexible 
shaft and covered it again, and then 
all flexure controls off and out. It 
had taken less than five seconds, 
and one more to deposit the shred 
of lung tissue in the biopsy constant-temperature nutrient bath. 

Hank was at the door. Anna, 
leaning feebly against the tabic, 
straightened to tell him: "Go and 
lie down, Hank. It's all right." 

"Keep him away from me," 
warned Graham from the bed. "He 
was going to jump me before." 

"1 just wanted to see the baby," 
Hank said apologetically. 

Tony turned to the intercom, 
buzzing the Kandros'. "Come on 
over," he told them. "You can have 
your baby back for keeps now. Is 
Gracey still there? Joe ? I think 
I've got that tissue specimen for 
you. How fast can you get a test?" 

"For God's sake, Tony, where 
did you get it?" Gracey was demanding on die other end. 

"From a Brownie." He couldn't 
resist it. "That's what I said. Lung 
tissue of a Brownie." 

He hung up. 

"A Brownie? It is true! There 
are Brownies, aren't there?" 

Tony turned to find the Kandros standing by the examination 
table. Polly already had her baby 
in her arms. 

Jim patted her shoulder. "He 



doesn't really mean it, Polly. Do 
you, Doc?" 

Graham was grinning openly. 

Tony turned from one to the 
other, not answering. 

There was a commotion in the 
living room and Brenner burst in, 
carrying a familiar box. "He just 
dived for it, Tony," Mimi said. 
"He said it was . . ." 

"Careful !" said the doctor. 
"You'll spray marcaine all over the 
place. Put it down, man!" ■ 

BRENNER did, and unwrapped 
it with practiced precision. 
"My stuff, Doctor," he said. 
"Think I don't know my own 
crates? Mrs. Jonathan, my price for 
your assets has just dropped to two 
and one-half million. And I am 
now in a position to prosecute. I 
hope none of you will make difficultdes." 

Jim Kandro said, "I don't know 
what this is all about, but we need 
that stuff for Sunny." 

"You don't believe that, do 
you?" the drug maker asked scornfully. 

"I don't know what to believe," 
said Kandro. "But he's — different. 
And it makes sense. He doesn't 
have to take OxEn, so he has to 
take something else. You better 
leave it for us, Mr. Brenner." 

The drug maker looked at Jim 
wisely. "It's okay, Mac, ' ' he decided. "If you've got the habit and 
you can't kick it, why don't you 
come to work for me? I can use 



93 




 



you. And you don't have to take 
so much. The micron dust in the 
air takes your edge off — " 

"That's not it," said Kandro. 
"Why don't you listen, to rue? We 
need that stuff for Sunny. The doctor says so and he ought to know. 
It's medicine, like vitamins. You 
wouldn't keep vitamins from a little 
baby, would you?" 

Graham snickered. 

KANDRO turned and lectured 
angrily: "You stay out of 
this. There hasn't been anything 
but trouble since you got here. Now 
you could at least keep from braying while a~ man's trying to reason 
with somebody. You may be smart 
and a big writer, but you don't 
have any manners at all if you can't 
keep quiet at a time like this." 

He turned to Brenner. "You 
know we don't have any money 
here, or I'd offer you what we had. 
I guess the box is yours, and nobody has a claim to it except you. 
But Polly and me can get permission from the Council to go and' 
work out whatever the box would 
cost. Couldn't we, Tony? Mirni ? 
The rest would let us, wouldn't 
they?" 

"I'm sorry, Mac," the drug 
maker said. "I wish I could make 
you understand, but if I can't, that 
doesn't matter. This box is going 
with me. It's evidence in a crime." 

"Mr. Brenner," Jim Kandro said 
thickly, "I can't let you out of here 
■with that box. We need it for 



Sunny. I told you and toid you. 
Now give it here." He put out 
one huge hand. 

"How about it, Mrs. Jonathan?" 
Rrenner seemed to be, ignoring the 
big man's menacing advance. "Two 
and a half million ? It's a very 
reasonable price, all things considered. Your new father here would 
be glad to take it." 

"I'll take it, all right," growled 
Jim. "Hand it over. Right now." 
He was a scant four feet from the 
drug maker; Brenner's eyes were 
still fixed mockingly on Mimi 
Jonathan. 

Kandro took one more step forward and Anna cried faintly: 
"No!" 

Brenner stepped back and there 
was a large pistol in his hand. 
"This," he told them, "is fully 
automatic. It keeps firing as long 
as I hold the trigger down. Now 
for the last time listen, all of you. 
I'm going, and I'm taking my box 
with me. If you try to stop me, I 
have a perfect right to use this 
gun. You know better than I do 
what fingerprints the authorities 
will find on the box. You're caught 
red-handed and I won't have any 
trouble proving it to my man Bell. 
If you people decide to be reasonable instead, you better let me know 
— soon." 

Mimi Jonathan said clearly: "So 
you're going to throw us off Mars, 
Mr. Brenner?" 

"If necessary," he said, not following. 



MARS CHILD 



"You mean you're going to kick 
us out and we'll never see Mars 
again? And all the sacrifices we've 
made here will be a joke?" 

He didn't get what she was driving at. "Yes," he said irritably. 
"You're cjuite right — " 

He was cut off by Hank, broken 
at last under the goading. The 
youngster sprang, raving, at Brenner, bowling him over as the pistol 
roared in a gush of bullets that 
ripped Hank's body. 

And then there was a silence into 
which Sunny Kandro shrieked his 
fear and dismay. Mimi leaned 
against the wall and shut her eyes. 
She wanted to vomit. She heard 
Tony's awed whisper: ". . . 
smashed his irachea . . . broke his 
neck . . . belly shot clean out . . ." 
She shuddered, and hoped and 
feared that she'd carry this guilt 
alone to the grave. 

CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX 

"pOME on, Polly. You come 
out here." Kandro led his 
wife, still carrying Sunny, out to 
the living room. 

Faces were peering through the 
hospital window and they heard 
Nick Cant re) la shouting: "Let me 
through, damnit! Clear away from 
that door!" And he was in, latching the door from the street. He 
snapped the curtains shut with an 
angry yank. "What in God's name 
happened? I was coming for that 
tissue culture and now this — " 



"Don't worry about it," said 
Graham drily and with effort from 
the bed. "Just a little useful murder. Hank RadclifT, hero of the 
Colony, gives his life to save the 
world from Big Bad Brenner — 
sweet Jesus!" he swore in awed 
delight. "What a story! "The Killing of Hugo Brenner' — an eye-witness account by Douglas Graham! 
Swee-eet Jesus ! Didn't Brenner 
know who I was?" 

Mimi started. "I guess not," she 
realized. "I never told him." • 

"You're plenty beat up," Tony 
pointed out. "He wouldn't have 
recognized you. Hey, Nick, let's 
get those bodies out of here." 

"Beat up is right," Graham 
chortled, "and it was worth it! 
Thank yon, my friends, whichever 
one of you — or how many was it ? 
— did 'that job on me. I thank you 
from the bottom of my poor old 
gunther's heart. Just to be able to 
lie here and listen to all that!" 

"1 don't know who did it last 
time." Nick took one menacing 
step toward the bed. "But, by God, 
if you're starting on another of your 
yarns, I know who's going to . . ." 

"Nick, wail a minute. You don't 
know what he heard." 

"Hey, CantrcIIa, I need a hand 
here." 

"1 know who did it." Anna had 
to shout to make herself heard 
above Mimi and Tony, both talking at once. In the sudden silence, 
she said; "Didn't I tell you, Tony? 
I guess It was while you were away

that I found out. They did it. I 
think he was planning to hurt the 
baby. Or they thought he was." 

"Tbey?" the writer asked contemptuously. " Brownies again ? 
You're a good second-gucsser. Miss 
Willcndorf, but you missed out this 
time. The only designs I ever had 
on the Kandro kid were to get him 
back to Earth where he could be 
properly cared for — instead of getting marcaine dosed out to him to 
cover up for Mama." 

*<T 1STEN, you, lying crimp." 

.1— J Nick continued his arrested 
advance on Graham. "If you think 
you're safe to turn out more of that 
kind of stuff just because you're 
laid up in bed, you better start 
thinking all over again. I've got no 
compunctions about kicking a rat 
when he's down." 

"Nick! Stop it!" Swift and sure 
and deadly sharp, Mimi's voice 
came across the room like a harpoon. "Give him a chance! You 
didn't hear what he heard — what 
Brenner said. I don't see how anybody could get a story against Sun 
Lake out of it." 

"Thank you kindly, ma'm." Graham grinned painfully. "Good to 
know somebody around here is still 
sane. Don't tell me you go for this 
Brownie nonsense too!" 

"I — don't know," she said. "If" 
I'd heard it from anybody but Tony 
and Anna, I wouldn't believe a 
word of it. But they did get the 
bxby back." 



"Back from where?" 

Tony realized for the first time 
that Graham didn't even knowabout Sunny' s kidnaping. And the 
Others, for that matter, still didn't 
know what had happened in the 
cave. 

"Listen," he said. "If you'll all 
take it easy for a few minutes, Anna 
and I have a lot to tell you. But 
first . . . Nick, help me move them 
to the living room floor. Anna, get 
blankets to cover them." 

"Wait a minute." She went into 
the living room. "All right," she 
called back a moment later, and 
Tony and Nick together carried 
what was left of Hank through the 
door. "I wanted to get the Kandros out first," Anna explained, 
locking the front door again. 

They laid out Brenner's body 
next to Hank's, and covered them 
both with blankets. The two men 
started back to the hospital, but 
Anna laid her hand on Tony's arm 
to stop him. 

"Could I see you a minute?" 

"Of course." He let Nick go 
ahead, then asked, worried, "Ansie, darling, wbat's the matter?" 

She closed the door firmly between them and the others in the 
hospital. 

"Tony, we can't tell them," she 
said. "Not now." 

"Why not? They've got to 
know." 

"Don't you see? We shouldn't 
have talked as much as we did. We 
shouldn't have said or done any

thing in front of Graham, but he 
doesn't believe it yet. If we convince him — Tony, the Brownies are 
terrified of people. They've kept 
away from people all along. For a 
reason. Don't you see?" she asked 
urgently. "Think what would happen to them. Think! I got just a 
flash from Graham's mind when I 
said they did it, before he decided 
to be skeptical. It was brutal. 
They'd be exterminated . . .'* 

He did see it. She was right. He 
thought of Hackenburg over at 
Pittco, and Brownies being worked 
in the mines — "native labor." He 
thought of what an Earth power 
would give to have telepaths in its 
military intelligence. He thought 
of the horror and hatred people 
would feel for the "mind-reading 
monsters." He thought of Brownies in 200s, on dissecting tables . . . 

HE thought of Sun Lake, still 
facing a charge of theft; 
of the difference it would make in 
Graham's story if he knew it 
wasn't Sun Lakers who attacked 
him. He thought of what the existence of the -Brownies would mean 
to medical and biochemical research. And he made up his mind. 

Anna looked away with' anger in 
her eyes, hopelessness in the set of 
her shoulders. 

"Why?" she begged. "They're — 
oh, Tony, they're decent J Not like 
most people." 

"Because we know about them, 
that's why. Because you can't — you 



just can't keep a secret like that. 
Because it means too much to men, 
to all men, to mankind, or whatever paft of it survives the end of 
Earth. Anna, Sun Lake may not be 
the answer to our future — the 
Brownies may be. Have you 
thought of that? They need us, 
they need to learn some of the 
things our civilization has to offer 
— and we need them. That piece of 
tissue I took from Sunny' s lungs 
may mean the end of dependence 
on Earth for OxEn., and that's just 
one first thing. There's no knowing 
how much we can learn, how they 
can help us to adapt, what new 
knowledge will come out of the 
contact. We can't keep it to ourselves. That's all there is to it." 

"There's no use arguing, is 
there?" 

"I'm afraid not," he said as 
gently as he could. He opened the 
door. "Are you coming back?" 

She hesitated, then followed. 

ii 

"rpiHAT'S it," Tony wound up 
X the narrative of their visit 
to the cave, and then repeated, this 
time to Graham: "That's it. But I 
think you ought to know that Anna 
was trying to persuade me not to 
tell this story in front of you, to 
let you go on not believing in 
Brownies. She was afraid of what 
people would do to them once it 
became known. I'm afraid too. 
What you write will hive a lot to 



102 




 



do with it." He paused. "What 
are you going to write?" 

"I'm damned if I know!" Graham tried to lift his head, and decided against it. "It's either the 
most ingenious yarn I've ever heard 
— it covers every single accusation 
against you people, from mareaiae 
theft to mayhem on my person — 
or it's the biggest story in the 
world. And I'm damned if I know 
which!" 

He relapsed into a thoughtful 
silence, broken suddenly by the 
roar of a large plane. An instant 
later there was the noise of a second, and then a third. One at a 
time they came closer, and died 

out. 

"That would be Bell." Mimi 
stood up wearily.- "I don't mind 
saying I'm confused. What do we 
do now?" 

"He's coming," Tony reminded 
her, "to help Mr. Graham. Perhaps we should leave it up to our 
guest to tell the Commissioner 
whatever he sees fit." 

The writer was silent, stonyfaced. 

"There's a slight matter of a 
couple of stiffs in the living room," 
Nick .reminded them. '"The Commish might want to know about 
them. Strictly inter-colony stuff." 

"You know," Graham broke in 
suddenly, "if I was dumb enough 
to believe your story about Brownies— and if your little experiment 
with the kid's lungs works — Sun 
Lake could get to be quite a place." 



"How do you mean?" Gracey 
asked. 

"The way Mr. Brenner had it 
figured, your Lab is practically 
made to order for marcainc manufacture. And I gather you think 
you can turn out OxEn too, if that 
lung tissue is good. If there's anything behind all this Brownie talk 
— well, you've got a deal that looks 
worth a trillion. You can supply 
OxEn to all of Mars at what price? 
It wouldn't cost you anything compared to Earth-import ..." 

He looked around the circle of 
astonished faces. 

"Don't tell me none of you even 
thought of that? Not even yon?" 
he appealed to Mimi. 

She shook her head. "That's not 
the Sun Lake idea," she said stiffly. 
"We wouldn't be interested." 

Anna smiled, very slightly, and 
there w:.s a violent banging at the 
front door. 

iii 

TONY went slowly through the 
living room. 'I "he door was beginning to shake under the blows. 

"Cut that out and I'll open it!" 
he yelled. There was silence as he 
swung the door open. A sergeant 
of the guards, three others, and 
Bell, who was well in the rear. Hemust have known thcre'd been 
shooting. 

"What's been going on?" the 
Commissioner began. He snified 
the air and his eyes traveled to the 



MARS CHILD 



103 



covered bodies, "Graham? If it is, 
we might have a murder arrest. His 
dispatch gave you people plenty of 
motive." 

"No. Brenner," Tony said shortly. "And a young man named Hank 
Radcliff." 

Bell, starting for the figures, recoiled. "Sergeant," he said, and 
gestured. The non-com gingerly 
drew back the blankets, exposing 
the drug maker's face. The Commissioner stared for a long moment 
and said hoarsely: "Cover it, Sergeant." He turned to Tony. "What 
happened ?" 

"We have a disinterested witness," said the doctor. "Douglas 
Garham. He saw the whole thing." 

rpONY led the way into the hosVL pital. The sergeant followed, 
then the Commissioner. Graham 
said from his bed: "Visiting a dead 
friend?" 

Bell snapped: "It's an inter-colony crime. Murder. Obviously I 
can't take the word of anybody 
who's a member of this community. 
Did you witness the killing?" 

"I was a witness, all right," said 
Graham. "Best damn witness you 
ever saw. Billions of readers hang 
on my every word." He made an 
effort and raised himself on one 
elbow. "Remember the chummy 
sessions we used to have in Washington, Bell?" 

On the Commissioner's forehead, 
sweat formed. 

"Here's the story of the killing," 



said Graham. "Brenner pulled his 
gun on a man named Kandro during a little dispute. He threatened 
to kill Kandro, went into some detail about how fully automatic that 
gun was and — let me think — his 
exact words were 'spray the room.' 
With a. babe in arms present. 
Think of it, Bell! Not even you 
would have done a thing like that; 
not even in the old days. The Radcliff bid jumped Brenner and took 
all the slugs in his belly. I guess 
they were dumdums, because the 
gun looked to me like a .38 and 
none of them went through. Only 
the Radcliff boy squashed Brenner's neck before he knew he was 
dead. Reminded me of a time once 
in Asia — " 

Bell cut him off. "Did Brenner 
die right away? Did he — say anything before he died?" 

"Deathbed confession? Delirious 
rambling? No." 

The Commissioner relaxed perceptibly. 

"But," said the newsman, "He 
talked quite a bit before he pulled 
the gun. He didn't recognize me 
with my battered face and I didn't 
introduce myself. He thought it 
was just a bunch of Sun Lakers in 
here and that nobody would believe 
a word they said about him. Brenner talked quite a bit." 

"Sergeant !" Bell broke in. "I 
won't be needing you for a while. 
Wait for me in the other room. 
And see to it nobody touches those 
bodies !" 



104 




 



THE door closed behind the 
non-com, and Graham laughed. 
"Maybe you do know, eh, Commish? Maybe you know Brenner 
liked to refer to you as 'my man 
Bell" ?*' 

The Commissioner's eyes ran unhappily around ihe room. "You 
people," he said. "Get out. All of 
you. Leave us alone — so I can take 
a statement." 

"Mo," said Graham, "they stay 
here. I'm not a strong man these 
days, but Brenner talked quite a 
bit. I wouldn't want anything to 
slop me Ironi getting the story to 
an eagerly waiting world." 

Beli looked around hopelessly. 
Tony saw Nick's fate twist into a 
knowing, malevolent grin; like the 
others, he made an effort to imitate it. 

"What do you want, Graham?" 
asked the Commissioner. "What 
are you trying to get at?" 

"Not a thing," the writer said 
blandly, "By the way, in my statement on the killing, should I include what Brenner had to say 
abou t you ? He men t Ion cd some 
financial matters, too. Would they 
be relevant ?" 

Tony tried to remember what 
financial matters Brenner had discussed, aside from the price he 
offered for the Colony. None — but 
Graham was a shrewd bluffer. 

The Commissioner made a last 
effort to pull himself together. 
' 'You can ' t in t i m ida te me, Graham," he rasped. "And don't think 



I can't be tough if you force my 
hand. I'm in the clear. I don't care 
what Brenner said; I haven't done 
a thing." 

"Yet," said Lhc writer succinctly. "Your part was to come later, 
wasn't it?" 

Bell's face seemed to collapse. 

"Still think you can get tough?" 
Gra-ham j eered. ' 'Try it, and 1 
guarantee that you'll be hauled backto Earth on the next rocket, to be 
tried for malfeasance, exceeding 
your authority, accepting bribes and 
violating the narcotics code. I can 
also guarantee that you will be 
convicted and imprisoned for the 
rest of your life. Don't try to bluff 
me, you tin-horn sport. I've been 
bluffed by experts." 

THE Commissioner began shrilly, 
"I won't stand for — ■" and 
cracked. "For God's sake, Graham, 
be reasonable! What have t ever 
done to you? What do you want? 
Tell me what you want!" 

The writer fell back on the bed. 
"Nothing right now, thanks. If I 
think of anything, I'll let you 
know." 

The Commissioner started to 
speak, and couldn't. Tony saw the 
veins of tension stand out. He saw, 
too, how Anna's lip was curling in 
disgust. 

Graham seemed amused. "There 
is one thing, Commish. An intercolony .matter under your jurisdiction, I believe. Will you remove 
those carcasses on your way out? 



MARS CHILD 



105 



You'd be surprised how sensitive I 
am about such things." 

He closed his eyes and waited 
till the door was shut behind the 
departing guest. When he opened 
them again, all the self-assurance 
was gone out of them, 

"Doc," he moaned, "give me a 
shot. "When I got up on my elbow 
something tore. God, it hurts!" 

While Tony took care of him, 
Joe Graccy said : "It was a grand 
performance, Mr. Graham. Thank 
you for what you did." 

"I can undo it," the reporter 
said flatly, "or I can use it any way 
I want to. If you people have been 
lying to me . . ." He sighed with 
relief. "Thanks, Doc. That's a help. 
Now if you want anything out of 
my man Bell — show me one of 
your Brownies !" 

CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN 

GRAHAM'S challenge fell into 
a silent room. Everyone waited for Tony to speak; Tony waited 
for Anna. 

"I don't, see why not," she said 
at last. "I guess they'd do it." She 
looked despairingly at Tony. "Is 
this -the only way?" she pleaded. 

"It's the only way you're going 
to beat that marcaine-theft rap," 
Graham answered for hkn. 

"All right. I'll go out there in 
the morning. I think 1 can talk 
them into it." 

"If you don't mind, Miss Willendorf, I'd rather it was right now. 



In twelve hours, your hot-shot engineer here could probably build 
a Brownie." 

"I can try," she said. "But I 
can't promise. Not even for tomorrow. I only think I can talk one of 
them into coming here. . I don't 
know how they'll feel about it." 

Graham grinned. "That's about 
how I figured it," he said, "Thanks, 
folks. It was a good show while it 
lasted." 

"We're going," Tony said grimly. "And we'll bring you back a 
Brownie." 

"Still not good enough," the 
writer said. "If you go, I go with 
you. You mind if I'm just a little 
suspicious ?" 

"It's ten kilometers to the Rimrocks," Tony told him. "Most of 
it by half track, the rest by 
stretcher for you." 

"The hell with your humanitarian sentiments! It's your medical 
opinion, if any, that I want!" 

"You'll live. No danger of that." 

"All right," the writer said. 
"When do we start?" 

Tony looked cjuestioningly at 
Anna, who nodded. "Right now," 
the doctor said, "or any time you're 
ready." He opened a cabinet and 
fished out a patent-syringe ampoule. "Tbis should make it easier." 
He started to open the package'. 

"No, thanks,"' Graham said. "I 
want to see what I see — if anything." His eyes went swiftly from 
one face to another, studying them 
for reactions. 



104 




 



"It" you can take it, I can," the 
doctor told him. But he dropped 
the package in his pocket before 
they left. 

IN THE rattling half track, -with 
Anna driving and Tony in the 
truck body beside Graham, the 
writer said through clenched teeth: 
"God help you if you tell me the 
Brownies aren't biting tonight. It's 
a damn-fool notion' anyway. You've 
been telling me Brownies are born 
of Earth people. Why aren't there 
any born on Earth?" 

"It's because of what the geneticists call a lethal gene. Polly and 
Jim T for instance. Each one of them 
had a certain lethal gene in their 
heredity. Either of them could have 
married somebody wi thout the 
lethal gene and had ordinary 
babies, on Earth or on Mars, because the gene is a recessive. On 
Earth, when Polly's lethal gene and 
Jim's lethal gene matched, it was 
fatal to their offspring. They never 
came to term; the gene produced 
a foetus which couldn't survive the 
womb on Earth. I don't know what 
factors are involved in that failure 
— cosmic rays, the gravity or what. 
But on Mars the foetus comes to 
term and is — a Brownie. 

"A Brownie is a Martian. Tliey 
don't just accept Mars air like an 
Earthman with Marsworthy lungs. 
They can't stand Earth air. And 
they need a daily-ration of marcaine 
to grow and live. That's who stole 
Brenner's marcaine. That's why 



they slipped marcaine into Poll/ 
Kandro's food. They wanted her 
to pass it to Sunny in her milk. 
When we put Sunny on the bottle, 
they stole him so they could give 
him marcaine. They surrendered 
him on our promise to see that he 
got it." 

"And that's a perfect cover-story 
for a dope-addict mama," scoffed 
the writer. "How many Brownies 
are there supposed to be?" 

"A couple of hundred. I suppose about half of them are firstgeneration. There must have been 
a very few in the beginning, children of homesteaders abandoned 
on a desert ranch when their parents died, who crawled out and 
lived off the country, chewing marcaine out of the weed. And they 
must have 'stolen' other Brownie 
babies from other homesteaders 
when they grew." 

Graham swore against the pain. 
"The Kandro kid looks as normal 
as any other baby. How are the 
Brownies supposed to know he 
isn't? Does he give them a password ?" 

Tony explained wearily: "They 
are telepathic. It explains a lot of 
things — -why they're only seen by 
people they want to see them, why 
they could steal Brenner's marcaine 
and not get caught They can hear 
people coming — their thoughts, 
that is. That's why they beat up 
Big Ginny; she was aborting a 
Brownie baby. Why they beat the 
hell out of you. Why they sensibly 



MARS CHILD 



keep away from most Earth pcopie." 

"Except Red Sand Jim Granata, 

eh?" 

"Granata was a liar. He probably never saw a Brownie in his 
life. He heard all the Brownieyarns and used them to pint on 
good commercial shows." 

Anna maneuvered the half track 
around a spur of rock picked out 
by the headlights and ground the 
vehicle to a stop. "It's too rugged 
from here on," she said. "We'll 
have to carry him the rest of the 
way." 

"You warm enough? Another 
blanket?" asked Tony. 

"You're really going through 
with this, aren't you ?" said the 
writer. "I'm crazy to play along, 
but // — // this is a story and I get 
beaten on it — Oh, hell, yes, I'm 
warm enough. Stretcher ought to 
be easier going than this tin can." 

ANNA led, with Graham swaying between them on a shoulder-suspended litter that lef t the 
bearers' hands free. The writer's 
weight was not much of a burden 
in this gravity, Both she and Tony 
used torches to pick their way 
among the scree that had dribbled 
for millenia, one stone at a time, 
down the weathering Rimrocks. 
They smcllcd the acrid fumes of 
Pittco across the hills, fouling the 
night air, and Graham began to 
cough. 

"Anna?" asked the doctor. 



She knew what lie meant, and 
s.iid shortly: "Not yet." 

Another hundred meters, and 
Tony felt her begin to pull off to 
the right. Her "homing" led them 
to the foot of the mcsalike hills a 
few meters from a cave mouth. 
They headed in. 

"Quite soon," said Anna, and 
then: "We can put him down." 

"Be very quiet," Tony told the 
writer. He himself felt the faint, 
eerie "touch" of a Brownie in his 
mind. "They're very sensitive 
to . . ." 

''Cetrgbl" shrieked Graham as a 
Brownie stepped into the beam 
from Anna's light. It clapped its 
hands over its cars and fled. 

"Now sec what you did!" ragee? 
Anna in an angry whisper. "Their 
ears — you almost deafened him." 

"Get him back !" The writer's 
voice was tremulous. 

"I don't know if 1 can," Anna 
said coldly. "He doesn't have to 
take orders from you or me. All I 
can do is try." 

"You'd better. It scared the hell 
out of me, I admit, but so did the 
Brownies in Granata's Interplanetary Show, and they were fakes." 

"Man, didn't you feel it?" asked 
Tony incredulously. 

"What?" asked Graham. 
"Please be quiet, both of you!" 
They waited a long time in the 
cold corridor before the thing reappeared, stepping warily into the 
.circle of light. 

Suddenly Anna laughed. "He 



108 




 



wants to know why you want to 
pull his ears off. He sees you thinking of pulling his ears and the ears 
coming off and he's as puzzled as 
he can be." 

"Shrewd guess," said Graham. 
"Do I got to pull them?" 

"No. If you have any questions, 
tell me, and I'll try to ask him." 

"I think it's a fake. Come out 



from behind those whiskers, whoever you are. Stillman? Gracey? 
No, you're too short. I'll bet you're 
that little punk Tad Campbell 
from the radio shack. I'd like to 
get my hands on those flapping 
ears just for one second." 

"This isn't getting us anywhere," 
said Tony. "Graham, you think of 
a person or a scene or something, 



MARS CHILD 



109 



the Brownie will get it telepathically, give it to Anna and she'll 
say what it is." 

"Fair enough," said the writer. 
"I don't know what it's supposed 
to prove, but it's some kind of 
test. I'm thanking. 4 ' 

A moment later Anna said evenly: "If you weren't beaten up already, I'd slap your face off." 

"I'm sorry," said Graham hastily. "I was only kidding. I didn't 
really think it would — but it 3id, 
didn't it?" With mounting excitement lie said: "Ask him who he 
is, who his people were, whether 
he's m.irried, how old he is — " 

Anna held up her hand. "That's 
enough to" start. I can't think of 
any way to ask his name. His parents — nut Brownies, homesteaders 
— a shack and a goat — a kitchen 
garden — tall, tall people, the man 
wears thick glasses — Tony! It's the 
Tollers !" 

"That's impossible," he said. 
"Their son's on Earth. He never 
answers their letters," the doctor 
remembered. "They keep writing, 
and — How old was he when he 
left?" 

"I don't know," she answered a 
moment later. "He doesn't understand the question." 

"I felt it," said the writer, suddenly, in a frightened voice. "Like 
a thing touching you inside your 
head. Is that him?" 

"That's him. Just don't fight it." 

After a Jong silence Graham said cjuietly: "Hell, he's all 



right. They're all-right people, 
aren't they?" 

"Do you want to ask him any 
more questions?" asked Anna. 

"A million of them. But not. 
right now. Can I come back again i " 
asked the writer slowly and heavily. "When I'm in better shape?" 
He waited for Anna's nod, then 
said: "Will you say thanks to him 
and get me to the 'track?" 

"Pain worse?" asked Tony. 

"No, I don't think so. Hell, I 
don't know. As a matter of fact, 
I'm j list worn out." 

The Brownie glided from the 
circle of light. " 'By, fella,'.' said 
Graham, and then grinned weakly. "He said good-by back at me!" 

Swaying between them on the 
litter on the way back to the 'track, 
the writer said at last; "Two System beats. Eyewitness account of 
Drug King Brenner's death, and 
the first factual eyewitness account 
of extraterrestrial intelligent life. 
One newsman per century gets one 
story like this. And I've got Jwol" 

They loaded him into the halftrack. He broke silence only once 
on the bumpy trip back to Sun 
Lake, saying with a chuckle: "I 
think he liked me." And then he 
fell quietly asleep. 

ii 

GRACEY and Nick and half a 
dozen of the biochem lab boys 
were waiting for them at the hospital. Joe must have been watching 



no 




 



out the window, because he ran 
out to meet them. 

It was late, and the lights were 
already out in most of the double 
row of rust-brown huts. But Joe 
Gracey, the quiet one, the gentle 
ex -professor, possessor of eternal 
calm and detachment, came flying 
down the dim street, shouting: 
"Doc! Tony! We've got it!" 

"Sh-h . . ." Tony nodded toward the dozing man on the shoulder litter, but Graham was already 
opening his eyes. 

"What's up?" he asked mushily. "What's all excitement?" 

"Nothing at all," the doctor tried 
to tell him. "We're back in the 
Colony. And you're going to bed. 
Hold on just a minute, will you, 
Joe?" He knew how Gracey felt; 
it was hard enough to restrain his 
own jubilance and keep his voice 
jn neutral register. But Graham had 
had enough for one night, and 
Tony had to get his patient back 
to the hospital bed before he could 
take time to listen even to such 
news as Gracey bore. 

Joe helped them get the writer 
comfortably settled, and waited impatiently while the doctor made a 
quick check for any possible damage done by the trip. Finally, Anna 
pulled up the covers, and the three 
of them started out. 

"Oh, Doctor . . ." Tony turned 
to find Graham up again on one 
elbow, wide-eyed and not a bit 
sleepy. "I was just wondering if I 
could have my typewriter." Before 

MARS CHILD 



Tony could answer, the elbow collapsed and Graham smiled ruefully. "I guess not. I couldn't work 
it. You don't have anything as 
luxurious as an Earthside dictatyper 
in the place, do you?" 

"Sure," Tony told him. "We've 
got one in the Lab office. You get 
some rest now, and we'll set it up 
for you here in the morning." 

"I'm okay," Graham insisted. * 
"There's something I'd like to get 
on paper right away. I won't be 
able to sleep anyhow if I don't get 
it done." 

"You'll sleep," the doctor said. 
"I can give you a shot." 

"No." Graham "was determined. 
"If you can't get the dictatyper out 
here now, how about some pencil 
and paper ? I think I still know 
how to use them." 

"I'll see what we can do. Anna, 
will you come with me?" 

rpONY led her, not to the living 
-L room where the others were 
waiting, but into the bedroom. 
"How about k?" he asked in a 
whisper. "How's he feeling?" 

"It's a funny mixture, Tony," 
she said, "but I think it's a£l right. 
He's not nearly as excited as he 
was before. He's eager, but calm 
and — well, it's hard to express, but 
honest, too." 

"Right." He tightened his hand 
swiftly on her shoulder, and smiled 
down at her small earnest face. "A 
man could get too used to this/' 
he said. "'How do you suppose I 

ill 



got along before 'I knew about 
you ?" 

He strode into the living room 
and consulted briefly with Nick, 
after ,which two of the men from 
the biochem section tramped out 
to the Lab, and brought back the 
machine for Graham to use. 

Through the living room door, 
Tony heard the writer's voice 
droning on, dictating, and the soft 
tapping of the machine. But what 
was goring on in the hospital didn't 
seem important. 

THE thing that mattered was the 
tiny pinch of pink powder 
Nick and Joe had been waiting to 
show him. 

' 'Tony," said Nick, exultantly, 
"look at this stuff! It's damn near 
oral-administration OxEn. Took it 
through twelve stages of concentration and we'll take it through 
exactly three more to completion 
when Anna blows some hyvac cells 
for us. I tried and all I got was 
blistered ringers." 

"It works?" asked Tony. 
"It's beautiful,' ' said Gracey. 
"The Kelsey people must have fifty 
contaminants they don't even suspect are there. Now I want to know 
where that sample tissue came from 
and where you're going to get 
more. And what did you mean 
about Brownies?" 

"Didn't Nick tell you?" Tony 
looked from the puzzled face to 
the startled one, and chortled appreciatively. "You mean you've 



been working together on this thing 
all evening and you never . . . ?" 

"He didn't ask," Cantrella said 
defensively. "Anyhow, we weren't 
working together. We weren't even 
in the same Lab." 

"Okay," Tony grinned, "here 
goes again. You gave me the idea 
originally, Joe. As much as any 
one person or thing did. You were 
talking the other day about lethal 
genes. Remember, I tried to ask 
you about it this afternoon ?"_ 

"When Mimi blew up? Sure." 

"That's when it hit me. I got 
that lung tissue from Sunny Kandro, Joe. After we brought him 
home. He's a Brownie . . . the result of a Mars-viable gene that's 
lethal on Earth." 

"And there are more of them?" 
Gracey leaned forward excitedly. 
"Are they cooperative? Will they 
answer questions? And submit to 
examination ? When can I see 
one ?" 

"They're cooperative," Anna 
said, smiling. "The reason you 
haven't seen one yet is that they 
can't stand humans — too uncooperative to suit them. Examinations? 
I don't see why not, if your intentions are honorable. They're telepaths, so they'd know you didn't 
mean to harm them." 

"Telepaths !" Gracey breathed 
the word as Nick exclaimed it. 
"What other changes," the agronomist started to ask, then said instead: "No sense you telling me. I 
will see one? Soon?"

ANNA nodded. "Why not? 
They were willing to talk to 
him." She motioned to the dosed 
hospital door. 

"How about new tissue then?" 
Joe asked her. "Can we get it when 
we need it? You know how this 
Stuff works? The old culture keeps 
mutating, and yon have to start it 
over again. We can't keep taking 
slices out of Sunny all the time." 

"1 don't know," she hud to admit. "J don't know if they could 
understand what you want it for, 
or why you're doing it." 

"J don't think we'll have any 
trouble," Tony put in. "Nick, our 
Lab is equipped to turn out marcaine, isn't it?" 

"Well, hell — yes, of course, but 
what for ?" 

"Maivaiiie and OxEn both? Do 
we hive the facilities for it?" 

"Sure. Processing the OxEn 
won!! take up much." 

"Then I'm sure we can get our 
lung-scrapings," the doctor said. 
"What do you say, Ansae?" The 
name slipped out, and he never 
even noticed the sudden start led 
exchange of looks between the 
other men. He did notice the 
woman's slight hesitation and halfhidden smile. "Will they do it? 
After all, you're the expert on 
Brownies." 

"They like us," she said thoughtfully. "They trust us, too. They 
need marcaihe. Yes, I think they'd 
do it." 

"Doc!" It was Graham, calling 



from inside. Tony opened die door. 
"There anything left in that bottle 
of mine?" 

"Hasn't been touched." 

"Pour me a shot, will you? A 
good, long one. I'm not in such 
hot shape. And pass the bottle 
around." 

Tony filled a glass generously. 
"Take it and go to sleep," he ordered. "You're going to feel worse 
tomorrow." 

"Thanks. That's what I call a 
bedside manner." 

Graham grinned and tossed off 
the drink with a happy shudder. 
"I've got some copy here," he said. 
"Can Stillman get it out tonight?" 

TONY took the typed paper 
from the dictating machine 
and paused a moment, irresolutely. 

Grahani laughed sleepily. "It's 
in the clear," he said. "No code. 
And you can read it if you like. 
Two messages and Take One of 
the biggest running story of the 
century." 

"Thanks," said Tony. "Good 
■night." He closed the door firmly 
behind him. 

"Story from Graham," he said 
to the group. He buzzed ! Harve. 

"Read it!" .said Nick. "And if 
that lying rat pulls another — "■ 

Tony gathered courage at last to 
run his eyes over the copy, and 
gasped with relief. 

" 'Message to Marsport communications,' " he read. " 'Kill all 
copy previously sent for upcoming

substitutes. Doughs Graham.' And 
'.Message- to Commissioner Hamilton Bell, Marsport, Administration. 
As interested Jay observer strongly 
urge you withdraw intended application of Title Fifteen search cordon to Sun Lake Colony. Personal 
investigation convinces me theft 
allegations unfounded, Title Fifteen application grave injustice 
which my duty expose fullest before public and official circles on 
return Earth. Appreciate you message me acknowledgment. Douglas Graham.' " 

NICK'S yell of triumph hit the 
roof. "What are we waiting 
for?" he demanded. "Where's 
Minii? Wc have packing to do!" 

"What's the matter with him?" 
asked Harve Stillman, coming in. 

Tony was reading the last of 
the messages to himself. 

Anna told him: "You dike that 
one best of all. What's in it?" 

He looked up with a grin across 
his face. "I'm sorry," he said. 
"This is how it starts : "Marsport 
communications, sub following for 
previous copy, which kill. By 
Douglas Graham. With Brownies, 
lead to tome.' Harve, what does 
that mean ?" 

The ex-wire-serviceman snapped: "It's additional copy - on a 
story about Brownies — the first part 
isn't ready to go yet. What's he 
say, Tony?" 

The doctor read happily: " 'The 
administrative problems raised by 



this staggering discovery are not 
gre.il. It is fortunate that Dr. Hellman and Miss Willcndorf, co-discoverers of the Martians, are persons of unquestioned integrity, 
profoundly interested in protecting 
the new race from exploitation. I 
intend to urge the appointment of 
one of them as special Commissioner for theP.A.C. to take charge 
of Brownie welfare and Safety. 
There must be no repetition of 
the tragedies that marked Earthly 
colonial expansion when greedy 
and shortsighted — ' 

"Damn, that's great," muttered 
the radio man. "Let me file it." 

The doctor, with the grin still 
on his fate, handed over the copy 
and Harve raced out. 

"J told you," said Anna. 

Joe Gracey said: "Well, I certainly hope whichever one of you 
turns out to be Commissioner is 
going to give us Lab men a decent 
chance at research on the Brownies. 
■I was thinking — >I could probably 
work out a test for the lethal gene, 
or Brownie gene, better call it. 
Spermatozoa for a male, a polar 
body or an ovum from a female 
and we'd be able to tell — " 

' 'No ! " said Anna hysterically. 
"No, no!" 

The others were shocked into 
silence. 

"I'll take you home, Ansie," said 
Tony 

He took her arm and they 
walked out into the icy fright down 
the Colony street.

"Ansic, I've been sort of taking 
things for granted. I should ask 
you once, for the record." He 
stopped walking and f aced her. 
"Will you marry me?" 

"Oh, Tony!" The name exploded from her in fear and desire 
both. "Tony, how can we? I 
thought — for just a little while 
after I told you about me, I thought 
perhaps we could, that life "could 
be the way it is for other people. 
But now this. How can we?" 

"What are you afraid of?" 

"Afraid? I'm afraid of our children, afraid of this planet! I was 
never afraid before, I was hurt and 
bewildered when I knew too much 
about people, but — Tony, don't you 
see? To have a baby like Polly's, 
to have it grow up a stranger, an 
alien creature, to have it leave me 
and go to its — its own people . . ," 

HE TOOK her hand and began 
walking again, searching for 
the words he needed. 

"Ansie," he began, "I think we 
will be married. If you want tt as 
much as I do, we surely will be. 
And we'll have children. And more 
than that, the hope of all the race 
w ill lie In our children, Anna. Ours 
and the children of the other people here. And the children of the 
Brownies. Don't forget that. 

"They look different. They even 
think differently, and nobody 
knows more about that than you. 
But they're as human as we are. 
Maybe more so. 



"We've made a beginning here 
at Sun Lake tonight. We've cut 
the big knot, the knot that kept us 
tied to Earth. Brownies helped us 
do that, and maybe they can help 
us lick this planet in all the ways 
that still remain. Maybe they can 
help us cure the next Joan Radcliff. Maybe they can keep us from 
going blind when the protective 
shots from Earth stop coming 
through. 

"But maybe they can't." 

"Ansie, if our children should 
be Brownies, we'd not only have 
to face 'it, accept it without fear — 
we'd have to be glad. Brownies are 
the children of Mars, natural human children of Mars. We don't 
know yet whether Wt can live here; 
but we know they can. 

"They're gentle. They're honest 
and decent and rational. They trust 
each other, not because of blind 
loves and precedents, as we do, but 
because they know each other as 
Earth humans never can. If blind 
hates and precedents end life on 
Earth, Ansie, we can go on at Sun 
Lake. And we can go on that much 
better for knowing that even our 
failure, if we fail, won't be the 
end." 

He stopped at her door and 
looked down at her, searching for 
the understanding that had to be 
there. If Anna failed, what other 
woman would comprehend? 

"I'll ask you this time," she said 
soberly. ' "Tony, will you marry 
me?" — CYRIL JUDD
