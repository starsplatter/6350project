VENUS is a man's world BY WILLIAM TENN 



I'VE always said that even if 
Sis is seven years older than 
me — and a girl besides — she 
don't always know what's best. Put 
me on a spaceship jam-packed with 
three hundred females just aching 
to get themselves husbands in the 
one place they're still to be had 
— the planet Venus — and you 
know I'll be in trouble. 

i had trouble. With the law, 
which is the worst a boy can get 
into. 

Twenty minutes after we lifted 
from the Sahara Spaceport, I 
wriggled- out of my acceleration 
hammock and started for the door 
of, our cabin. 

"Now you be careful, Ferdinand," Sis called after me as sheopened a book called Family Patterns of the Frontier Woman. "Remember you're a nice boy. Don't 
make me ashamed of you." 

I tore down the corridor. Most 
of the cabins had purple lights on 
m front of the doors, showing that 
the girls were still inside their 
hammocks. That meant only the 
ship's crew was up and about. 
Ship's crews are men; women arc 
too busy with important things like 
government to run ships. I felt free 
all over — and happy. iNow was my 
chance to really see the Eleanor 
Roosevelt! 

TT WAS hard to believe I was 
X traveling in space at last. Ahead 
and behind me, all the way up to 
where the companionway curved in 
out of sight, there was nothing but 
smooth black wall and smooth 
white doors — on and on and on. 
Gee, I thought excitedly, this is 
one big ship! 

Of course, every once In a while 
I would run across a big scene of 
stars in the void set in the wall; 
but they were only pictures. Nothing that gave the feel of great 
empty space like I'd read about in 
The Soy Rocketeers, no portholes, 
no visiplates, nothing. 

So when I came to the crossway, I stopped for a second, then 
turned left. To the right, see, there 
was Deck Four, then Deck Three, 
leading inward past the engine 
fo'c'sle to the main jets and the 
grav helix going purr-purr-purrtypurr in the comforting way big 



machinery has when it's happy and 
oiled. But to the left, the crossway 
led all the way to the outside level 
which ran just under the hull. 
There were portholes on the hull. 

I'd studied all that out in our 
cabin, long before we'd lifted, on 
the transparent model of the ship 
hanging like a big cigar from the 
ceiling. Sis had studied it too, but 
she was looking for places like the 
dining salon and the library and 
Lifeboat 68 where we should go 
in case of emergency. I looked for 
the important things. 

As I trotted along the crossway, 
I sort of wished that Sis hadn't decided to go after a husband on a 
luxury liner. On a cargo ship, now, 
I'd be climbing from deck to deck 
on a ladder instead of having grav* 
ity underfoot all the time just like 
I was home on the bottom of the 
Gulf of Mexico. But women always know what's right, and a boy 
can only make faces and do what 
they say, same as the men have to 
do. 

Still, it was pretty exciting to 
press my nose against the slots in 
the wall and see the sliding panels 
that could come charging out and 
block the crossway into an airtight 
fit in case a meteor or something 
smashed into the ship. And all 
along there were glass cases with 
spacesuits standing in them, like 
those knights they used to have 
back in the Middle Ages. 

"In the event of disaster affecting the oxygen content of com

paniouway," they bad the words 
etched into the glass, "break glass 
with hammer upon wall, remove 
spaccsuit and proceed to don it in 
the following fashion." 

I read the "following fashion" 
until I knew it by heart. Boy, I 
said to myself, / hope we have that 
kind of disaster, I'd sure like to 
get into one of those! Bet it would 
be more fun than those diving suits 
back hi Undersea/ 

And all the time I was alone. 
That was the best part. 

THEN I passed Deck Twelve 
and there was a big sign. "Notice! Passengers not permitted past 
this point!" A big sign in red. 

I peeked around the corner. I 
knew it— the next deck was the 
hull. I could see the portholes. 
Every twelve feet, they were, filled 
with the velvet of space and the 
dancing of more stars than I'd ever 
dreamed existed in the Universe. 

There wasn't anyone on the 
deck, as far as I could see. And 
this distance from the grav helix, 
the ship seemed mighty quiet and 
lonely. If I just took one quick 
look . . . 

But I thought of what Sis would 
say and I turned around obediently. Then I saw the big red sign 
again. "Passengers not permitted—" 

Well! Didn't I know from my 
civics class that only women could 
be Earth Citizens these days? Sure, 
ever since the Male Desuffragc Act. 

VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD 



And didn't I know that you had 
to be a citizen of a planet in order 
to get an interplanetary passport? 
Sis had explained it all to mc in 
the careful, patient way she always 
talks politics and things like that 
to men. 

"Technically, Ferdinand, I'm the 
only passenger in our family. You 
can't be one, because, not being a 
citizen, you can't acquire an Earth 
Passport. However, you'll be going 
to Venus on the strength of this 
clause— 'Miss Evelyn Sparling and 
all dependent male members of 
Family, this number not to exceed 
the registered quota of sub-regulations pertaining' — and so on. I 
want you to understand these matters, so that you will grow into a 
man who takes an active interest 
in world affairs. No matter what 
you hear, women really like and 
appreciate such men." 

Of course, I never pay much 
attention to Sis when she says such 
dumb thihgs. I'm old enough, I 
guess, to know that it isn't what 
Women like and appreciate that 
counts when it comes to peoplegetting married. If it were. Sis and 
three hundred other pretty girls 
like her wouldn't be on their way 
to Venus to hook husbands. 

Still, if I wasn't a passenger, the 
sign didn't have anything to do 
with mc. I knew what Sis could 
say to that but at least it was an 
argument I could use if it ever 
came up. So I broke the law. 

'I was glad I did. The stars were 

5 



exciting enough, but away off to 
the left, about five times as big as 
I'd ever seen it, except in the 
movies, was the Moon, a great blob 
of gray and white pockmarks holding off the black of space. I was 
hoping to see the Earth, but I figured it must be on the other side 
of the ship or behind us. I pressed 
my nose against the port and saw 
the tiny flicker of a spaceliner taking off, Marsbound. I wished I 
was on that one.' 

Then I noticed, a little farther 
down the companion way, a stretchof blank wall where there should 
have been portholes. High up on 
the wall in glowing red letters 
were the words, "Lifeboat 47. 
Passengers: Thirty-two. Crew: 
■Eleven. Unauthorized personnel 
keep away!" 

Another one of those signs. 

I CREPT up to the porthole nearest it and could just barely make 
out the stern jets where it was plastered against the hull. Then I 
walked under the sign and tried to 
figure the way you were supposed 
to get into it. There was a very 
thin line going around in a big 
circle that I knew must be the door. 
But I couldn't see any knobs or 
switches to open it with. Not even 
a button you could press. 

That meant it was a sonic lock 
like the kind we had on the outer 
keeps back home in Undersea! But 
knock or voice? I tried the two 
knock combinations I knew, and 



nothing happened. I only remembered one voice key — might as well 
see if that's it, I figured. 

"Twenty, Twenty-three. 'Open 
Sesame." 

For a second, I thought I'd hit 
it just right out of all the million 
possible combinations — The door 
clicked inward toward a black hole, 
and a hairy hand as broad as my 
shoulders shot out of the hole. It 
closed around my throat and 
plucked me inside as if I'd been a 
baby sardine. 

I bounced once on the hard lifeboat floor. Before I got my breath 
and sat up, the door had been shut 
again. When the light came on, I 
found myself staring up the muzzle 
of .1 highly polished blaster and 
info the cold blue eyes of the biggest man I'd ever seen, 

He was wearing a one-piece suit 
made of some scaly green stuff that 
looked hard and soft at the same 
time. 

His boots were made of it too, 
and so was the hood hanging down 
his back. 

And his face was brown. Not 
just ordinary tan, you understand, 
but the deep, dark, burned-all-theway-in brown I'd seen on the lifeguards in New Orleans whenever 
we took a surface vacation — the 
kind of tan that comes f torn day 
after broiling day under a really 
hot Sun. His hair looked as if it 
had once been blond, but now 
there were just long combed -out 
waves with a yellowish tinge that 



6 




 



boiled all the way down to his 
shoulders. 

1 hadn't seen hair like Chat on 
a mm except maybe in history 
books; every man I'd ever known 
had his hair cropped in the fashionable soup-bowl style. I was staring at his hair, almost forgetting 
about the blaster which I knew it 
was against the law for him to have 
at all, when I suddenly got scared 
right through. 

His eyes. 

They didn't blink and there 
seemed to be no expression around 
them. Just coldness. Maybe it was 
the kind of clothes he was wearing 
that did it, but all of a sudden I 
was reminded of a crocodile I'd 
seen in a surface zoo that had 
stared quietly at me for twenty 
minutes until it opened two long 
tooth-studded jaws. 

"Green shatas!" he said suddenly. "Only a tadpole. I must be getting jumpy enough to splash." 

Then he shoved the blaster away 
in a holster made of the same scaly 
leather, crossed his arms on his 
chest and began to study me. I 
grunted to my feet, feeling a lot 
better. The coldness had gone out 
of his eyes. 

I held out my hand the way Sis 
had taught me. "My name is Ferdinand Sparling. I'm very pleased to 
meet you, Mr. — Mr. — " 

"Hope for your sake," he said 
to me, "that you aren't what you 
seem — tadpole brother to one of 
them husbandless anura." 



"What?" 
■ "A 'nuran is a female looking 
to nest. Anura is a herd of same. 
Come from Flatfolk ways." 

"Flatfolk are the Venusian natives, aren't they ? Are you a 
Venusian? What part of Venus do 
you come from? Why did you say 
you hope — " 

He chuckled and swung me up 
into one of the bunks that lined the 
lifeboat. "Questions you ask," he 
said in his soft voice. "Venus is a 
sharp enough place for a dryhorn, 
let alone a tadpole dryhorn with a 
boss-minded sister." 

"I'm not a dryleg," I told him 
proudly. "We're from Undersea." 

"Dry/jor;;, I said, not dryleg. 
And what's Undersea?" 

"Well, in Undersea we called 
foreigners and newcomers drylegs. 
Just like on Venus, I guess, you 
call them dryhorns." And then I 
told him how Undersea had been 
built on the bottom of the Gulf 
of Mexico, when the mineral resources of the land began to give 
out and engineers figured that a 
lot could still be reached from the 
sea bottoms. 

TJE NODDED. He'd heard 
J. X about the sea-bottom mining 
cities that were bubbling under protective domes in every one of the 
Earth's oceans just about the sametime settlements were springing up 
on the planets. 

He looked impressed when I 
told him about Mom and Pop bp


VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

ing one of the first couples to get 
married in Undersea. He looked 
thoughtful when I told him how 
Sis and I had been born there and 
spent half our childhood listening 
to the pressure pumps. He raised 
his eyebrows and looked disgusted 
when I told how Mom, as Underlet representative on the World 
Council, had been one of the 
framers of the Male DesufTragc Act 
after the Third Atomic War had 
resulted in the Maternal Revolution. 

HE ALMOST squeezed my arm 
when I got to the time Mom 
and Pop were blown up in a surfacing boat. 

"Well, after the funeral, there 
was a little money, so Sis decided 
we might as well use it to migrate. 
There was no future for her on 
Earth, she figured. You know, the 
three-out-of-four." 
"How's that?" 

"The three-out-of-four. No more 
than three women out of every 
four on Earth can expect to find 
husbands. Not enough men to ffd 
around. Way back in the Twentieth Century, it began to be felt, 
Sis says, what with the wars and 
all. Then the wars went on and a 
lot more men began to die or get 
no good from the radioactivity. 
Then the best men went to the 
planets, Sis says, until by now even 
if a woman, can scrounge a personal husband, he's not much to 
boast about." 



The stranger nodded violently. 
"(Not on Earth, he isn"t. Those 
busybody anura make sure of that. 
What a place! Suffering gridniks, 
I had a bellyful!" 

He told me about it. Women 
were scarce on Venus, and he 
hadn't been able to find any who 
were willing to come out to his 
lonely little islands; he had decided to go to Earth where there 
was supposed to be a surplus. Naturally, having been born and 
brought up on ,i very primitive 
planet, he didn't know "it's a 
woman's world," like the older 
boys in school used to say. 

The moment he landed on Earth 
he was in trouble. He didn't know 
he had to register at a governmentoperated hotel for transient males; 
he threw a bartender through a 
thick plastic window for saying 
something nasty about the length 
of his hair; and imagine! — he not 
only resisted arrest, resulting in 
three hospitalized* policemen, but 
he sasscd the judge in open court! 

"Told me a man wasn't supposed to say anything except 

through female attorneys. Told htr 
that where i came from, a man 
spoke his piece when he'd a mind 
to, and his woman walked by his 
side." 

"What happened?" I asked 
breathlessly. 

"Oh, Guilty of This and Contempt of That. That blown-up 
brinosaur took my last munit for 
£nes, then explained that she was

remitting the rest because I was a 
foreigner and uneducated." His 
eyes grew dark for a moment. He 
chuckled again. "But I wasn't going to serve all those fancy little 
prison sentences. Forcible Citizenship Indoctrination, they call it ? 
Shook the dead-dry dust of the misbegotten, God forsaken mother 
world from my feet forever. The 
women on it deserve their men. 
My pockets were folded from the 
fines, and the paddlefeet were 
looking for me so close I didn't 
dare radio for more munit. So 1 
stowed away." 

FOR a moment, I didn't understand him. When I did, I was 
almost ill. "Y-you mean," I choked, 
"th-that you're b-breaking the law 
right now ? And I'm with you 
while you're doing it?" 

He leaned over the edge of the 
bunk and stared at me very seriously. "What breed of tadpole are 
they turning out these days? Besides, what business do you have 
this close to the hull?" 

After a moment of sober reflection, I nodded. "You're right. I've 
also become a male outside the 
law. We're in this together." 

He guffawed. Then he sat up 
and began cleaning his blaster. I 
found myself drawn to the bright 
killer-tube with exactly the fascination Sis insists such things have 
always had for men. 

"Ferdinand your label ? That's 
not right for a sprouting tadpole. 



I'll call you Ford. My name's Butt. 
Butt Lee Brown." 

I liked the sound of Ford. "Is 
Butt a nickname, too?" 

"Yeah. Short for Alberta, but I 
haven't found a man who can draw 
a blaster fast enough to call me 
that. You see, Pop came over in 
the eighties — the big wave of 
immigrants when they evacuated 
Ontario. Named all us boys after 
Canadian provinces. I was the 
youngest, so I got the name they 
were savi. g for a girl." 

"You had a lot of bi others, Mr. 
Butt?" 

He grinned with a mighty set of 
teeth. "Oh, a nestful. Of course, 
they were all killed tin the Blue 
Chicago Rising by the MacGregor 
boys — all except me and Saskatchewan. Then Sas and me hunted the 
MacGregors down. Took a heap of 
time; we didn't float Jock MacGregor's ugly face down the Tuscany till both of us were pretty 
near grown up." 

I walked up close to where I 
could see the tiny bright copper 
coils of the blaster above the firing 
button. "Have you killed a lot of 
men with that, Mr. Butt?" 

"Butt. Just plain Butt to you, 
Ford." He frowned and sighted at 
the light globe. "No more'n twelve 
— not counting five government 
pacldlefeet, of course. I'm a peaceable planter. Way I figure it, violence never accomplishes much 
that's important. My brother Sas, 
now — " 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

HE HAD just begun to work 
into a wonderful anecdote 
about his brother when the dinner 
gong rang. Butt told me to scat. 
He said I was a growing tadpole 
and needed my vitamins. And he 
mentioned, very off-hand, that he 
wouldn't at all object it" 1 brought 
him some fresh fruit. It seemed 
there was nothing but processed 
foods in the lifeboat and Butt was 
used to a farmer's diet. 

Trouble was, he was a special 
kind of farmer. Ordinary fruit 
would have been pret+y easy to 
sneak into my pockets at meals. J 
even found a way to handle the 
kelp and giant watercress Mr. 
Brown liked, but things like seaweed salt and Venusian mudgrapes just had too strong a smell. 
Twice, the mechanical hamper refused to accept uny jacket for laundering and I had to wash it myself. 
But 1 learned so many wonderful 
things about Venus every time I 
visited that stowaway . . . 

I learned three wild-wave songs 
of the Flatfolk and what it is that 
the native Venusians hate so much; 
I learned how you tell the difference between a lousy government 
paddlefoot from New Kalamazoo 
and the slaptoe slinkcr who is the 
planter's friend. After a lot of 
begging, Butt Lee Brown explained 
the workings of his blaster, explained it so carefully that I could 
name every part and tell what it 
did from the tiny round electrodes 
to the long spirals of transformer. 



But no matter what, he would never 
let me hold it. 

"Sorry, Ford, old tad," he would 
drawl, spinning around and around 
in the control swivel-chaar at the 
nose of the lifeboat. "But way T 
look at it, a man who lets somebody else handle his blaster is like 
the giant whose heart was in an 
egg that an enemy found. When 
you've grown enough so's your pop 
feels you ought ,to have a weapon, 
why, then's the time to learn it and 
you might's well learn fast. Before 
then, you're plain too young to be 
even near it." 

"I don't have a father to give me 
one when I come of age. I don't 
even have an older brother as head 
of my family like your brother 
Labrador. All I have is Sis. And 
she — " 

"She'll marry some fancy dryhorn who's never been farther 
South than the Polar Coast. And 
she'll stay head of the family, if 
I know her breed of green shata. 
Bossy, opinionated. By the way, 
Fordie," he said, rising and stretching so the fish-leather bounced and 
rippled off his biceps, "that sister. 
She ever . .
And he'd be off again, cross-examining mc about Evelyn. I sat in 
the swivel chair he'd vacated and 
tried to answer his questions. Bur 
there was a lot of stuff I didn't 
know. Evelyn was a healthy girl, 
for instance; how healthy, exactly, 
I had no way of finding out. Yes, 
I'd tell him, my aunts on both sides 




 



of my family each had had 'more 
than the average number of children. No, we'd never done any 
farming to speak of, back in Undersea, but— yes, I'd guess Evelyn 
knew about as much as any girl 
there when it came to diving equipment and pressure pump regulation. 

How would I know that stuff 
would lead to trouble for me? 

SIS had insisted I come along to 
the geography lecture. Most of 
the other girls who were going to 
Venus for husbands talked to each 
other during the lecture, but not 
my sister! She hung on every 
word, look notes even, and asked 
enough questions to make the perspiring purser really work in those 
orientation periods. 

"I am very sorry, Miss Sparling," he said with pretty heavy sarcasm, "but I cannot remember any 
of the agricultural products of the 
Macro Continent. Since the human 
population is well below one per 
thousand square miles, it can readily be understood that the quantity 
of tilled soil, land or sub-surface, 
is so small that — Wait, I remember something. The Macro Continent exports a fruit though not 
exactly an edible one. The wild 
dunging drug is harvested there hy 
criminal speculators. Contrary to 
belief on Earth, the traffic has been 
growing in recent years. In fact — " 
"Pardon me, sir," I broke in, 
"but doesn't dunging come only 



from Leif Erickson Island off the 
Moscow Peninsula of the Macro 
Continent ? You remember, purser 
— Wang Li's third exploration, 
where he proved the island and 
the peninsula didn't meet for most 
of the year?" 

The purser nodded slowly. "I 
forgot," he admitted. "Sorry, 
ladies, but the boy's right. Please 
make the correction in your notes." 

But Sis was the only one who 
took notes, and she didn't take that 
one. She stared at me for a moment, biting her lower lip thoughtfully, while l l got sicker and sicker. 
Then she shut her pad with the 
final gesture of the right hand that 
Mom used to use just before challenging the opposition to come 
right down x>n the Council floor 
and debate it out with her. 

"Ferdinand," Sis said, "let's go 
back to our cabin." 

The moment she sat mc down 
and walked slowly around me, I 
knew I was in for it. "I've been 
reading up on Venusian geography 
in the shipis library," I told her 
in a hurry. 

"No doubt," she said drily. She 
shook her night-black hair out. 
"But you aren't going to tell me 
that you read about dunging in the 
ship's library. The books there have 
been censored by a government 
agent of Earth against the possibility that they might be read by 
susceptible young male minds like 
yours. 'She would not have allowed 
— this Terran Agent — " 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

"Paddlefoot," 1 sneered. 

Sis sat down hard in our zoomair chair. "Now that's a term," she 
said carefully, "that is used only 
by Venusian riffraff." 

"They're not !" 

"Not what?" 

''Riffraff," I had to answer, knowing I was getting in deeper all the 
time and not being able to help it. 
I musrn 't give Mr. Brown away ! 
"They're trappers and farmers, 
pioneers and explorers, who're 
building Venus. And it takes a real 
man to build on a hot, hungry hell 
like Venus." 

"Docs it, now?" she said, looking at me as if I were beginning 
to grow a second pair of ears. "Tell 
me more." 

"You can't have meek, law-abiding, women-ruled men when you 
start ■civilization on a new planet. 
You've got to have men who aren't 
afraid to .make their own law if 
necessary — with their own guns. 
That's where law begins; the books 
get written up later." 

"You're going to tell, Ferdinand, 
what evil, criminal male is speaking through your mouth!" 

"Nobody!" I insisted. "They're 
my own ideas!" 

■"They are remarkably well-organized for a young boy's ideas. A 
boy who, I might add, has previously shown a ridiculous but nonetheless entirely masculine boredom 
with political philosophy. I plan to 
have a government career on that 
new planet you talk about, Ferdi


nand — after I have found a good, 
steady husband, of course — and I 
don't look forward to a masculinist radical in the family. Now, 
who has been filling your head 
with all this nonsense?" 

T WAS sweating. Sis has that 
X deadly bulldog approach when 
she feels someone is lying. I pulled 
my pulpast handkerchief from my 
pocket to wipe my face. Something 
rattled -to the floor. 

"What -is this picture of me doing in your pocket, Ferdinand?" 

A trap seemed to be hinging 
noisily into place. "One of the 
passengers wanted to see how you 
looked in a bathing suit." 

"The passengers on this ship are 
all female. I can't imagine any of 
them that curious about my appearance. Ferdinand, it's a man who has 
been giving you these anti-social 
ideas, isn't it ? A war-mongering 
masculinist like all the frustrated 
men who want to engage in government and don't have the 
vaguest idea how to. Except, of 
course, in their ancient, bloody 
ways. Ferdinand, who has been perverting that sunny and carefree 
soul of yours?" 

"Nobody! Nobody!" 

"Ferdinand, there's no point in 
lying! I demand — " 

"I told you, Sis. I told you! And 
don't call me Ferdinand. Call me 
Ford." 

"Ford? Ford? Now, you listen 
to me, Ferdinand . . ."

After that it was all over but 
the confession. That came in a few 
moments. I couldn't fool Sis. She 
just knew me too well, I decided 
miserably. Besides, she was a girl. 

All the same, 1 wouldn't get Mr. 
Butt Lee Brown into trouble if I 
could help it. I made Sis promise 
she wouldn't turn him in if I took 
her to him. And the quick, nodding 
way she said she would made me 
feel just a little better. 

The door opened on the signal, 
"Sesame." When Butt saw somebody was with me, he jumped and 
the ten-inch blaster barrel grew out 
of his lingers. Then he recognized 
Sis from the pictures. 

He stepped to one side and, with 
(lie s:iinc- sweeping gesture, holstered his blaster and pushed his 
green hood off. It was Sis's turn 
to jump when she saw the wild 
mass of hair rolling down his back, 

"An honor, Miss Sparling," he 
said in that rumbly voice. "Please 
come right in. There's a hurry-up 
draft." 

So Sis went in and -1 followed 
right after her. Mr. Brown closed 
the door. J tried to catch his eye so 
I could give him some kind of 
hint or explanation, but he had 
taken a couple of his big strides and 
was in the control section with Sis 
She didn't give ground, though; 
I'll say that for her. She only came 
to his chest, but she had her arms 
crossed sternly. 

"first, Mr. Brown," she began, 
like talking to a cluck of a kid in 



class, "you realize that you are not 
only committing the political crime 
of traveling without a visa, and the 
criminal one of stowing away without paying your fare, but the moral 
delinquency* of consuming stores 
intended for the personnel of this 
ship solely in emergency?" 

HE OPENED his mouth to its 
maximum width and raised 
an enormous hand. Then he let the 
air out and dropped his arm. 

"I take it you either have no 
defense or care to make none," Sis 
added caustically. 

Butt laughed slowly and carefully as if he were going over each 
word. ' 'Wonder if all the anura 
talk like that. And you want to 
foul up Venus." 

"We haven't done so badly on 
Earth, after the mess you men made 
of politics. It needed a revolution 
of the mothers before — *' 

"Needed nothing. Everyone 
wanted peace. Earth is a weary old 
world." 

"It's a world of strong moral 
fiber compared to yours, Mr. Alberta Lee Brown." Hearing his 
rightful name made him move suddenly and tower over her. Sis said 
with a certain amount of hurry and 
change of tone, "What do you 
have Lo say about stowing away 
and using up lifeboat stores?" 

HE COCKED his head and considered a moment. "Look, 7 " 
he said finally, "I have more than 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

enough inunit to pay for round 
trip tickets, but I couldn't get a return visa because of that brinosaur 
judge and all the charges she hung 
on me. Had to stow away. Picked 
the Eleanor Roosevelt because a 
couple of the boys in the crew arc 
friends of mine and they were -willing to help. But this lifeboat — 
don't you know that every passenger ship carries four times as many 
lifeboats as it needs? Not to mention the food I didn't! eat because 
it stuck in my throat?" 

"Yes," she said bitterly. "You 
had this boy steal fresh fruit for 
you. 1 suppose you didn't know 
that under space regulations that 
makes him equally guilty?" 

"No, Sis, he didn't," I was beginning to argue. "All he wanted—" 

"Sure I knew. Also know that 
if I'm picked up as a stowaway, I'll 
be sent back to Earth to serve out 
those fancy little sentences." 

"Well, you're guilty of them, 
aren't you?" 

He waved his hands at her impatiently. "I'm not talking law, 
female; I'm talking sense. Listen! 
I'm in trouble because I went to 
Earth to look for a wife. You're 
■ standing here right now because 
you're on your way to Venus for 
a husband. So let's." 

Sis actually staggered back. 
"Let's? Let's what? Are — arc you 
daring to suggest that — that — " 

"Now, Miss Sparling, no hoopla. 
I'm saying let's get married, and 



you know it. You figured out from 
what the boy told you that I was 
chewing on you for a wife. You're 
healthy and strong, got good 
heredity, you know how to operate 
sub-surface machinery, you've lived 
underwater, and your disposition's 
no worse than most of the anura 
I've seen. .Prolific stock, too." 

I was so excited I just had to 
yell: "Gee, Sis, say yes!" 

MY SISTER'S voice was steaming with scorn. "And what 
makes you think that I'd consider 
you a desirable husband?" 

He Spread his hands genially. 
"Figure if you wanted a poodle, 
you're pretty enough to pick one tip 
on Earth. Figure if you charge off 
to Venus, you don't want a poodle, 
you want a man. I'm one. I own 
three islands in the Galertan 
Archipelago that'll be good oo2ing 

mudgiape land when they're 
cleared. Not to mention the rich 
bcrzcliot beds offshore. I got no 
bad habits outside of having my 
own way. I'm also passable goodlooking for a slaptoe planter. Besides, if you marry me you'll be 
the first mated on this ship- -.ind 
that's a splash most nesting females 
like to make." 

There was a longish .stretch of 
quiet. Sis stepped back and measured him slowly with her eyes; 
there was a lot to look at. He waited patiently while she covered the 
distance from his peculiar green 
boots to that head of hair. I was 



14 




 



so excited I was gulping instead of 
breathing, llmagine having Butt tor 
a brother-in-law and living on a 
wet-plantation in Flatfolk country! 

But then I remembered Sis's 
level head and I didn't have much 
hope any more. 

"You know," she began, "there's 
more to marriage than just — -*' 

"So there is," he cut in. "Well, 
we can try each other for taste." 
And he pulled her in, both of his 
great hands practically covering her 
slim, straight back. 

'Neither of them said anything 
for a bit after he let go. Butt spoke 
up first. 

"Now, me," he said, "I'd vote 
yes." 

Sis ran the tip of her tongue kind 
of delicately from side to side of 
her mouth. Then she stepped back 
slowly and looked at him as if she 
were .figuring out how many feet 
high he was. She kept on moving 
backward, tapping her chin, while 
Butt and I got more and more impatient. When she touched the lifeboat door, she pushed it open and 
jumped out. 

BUTT ran over and looked 
down the crossway. After a 
while, he shut the door and came 
back beside me. "Well," he said, 
swinging to a bunk, "that's sort of 
it." 

"You're better off, Butt," I burst 
out. "You shouldn't have a woman 
like Sis for a wife. She looks small 
and helpless, but don't forget she 



was trained to run an underwater 
city!" 

"Wasn't worrying about that," 
he grinned. "I grew up in the fifteen long years of the Blue 'Chicago 
Rising. Nope." He turned over on 
bis back and clicked his teeth at 
the ceiling. "Think we'd have nested out nicely." 

I hitched myself up to him and 
we sat on the bunk, glooming away 
at each other. Then we heard the 
tramp of feet in the crossway. 

Butt swung down and headed 
for the control compartment in the 
nose of the lifeboat. He had his 
blaster out and was cursing very 
interestingly. I started af ter him, 
but he picked me up by the seat of 
my jumper and tossed me toward 
the door. The Captain came in and 
tripped over me. 

I got all tangled up in his gold 
braid and million-mile space buttons. When we finally got to our 
feet and sorted out right, he was 
breathing very hard. The Captain 
was a round little man with a 
plump, golden face and a very 
scared look on it. He bumpbed at 
me, j List the way Sis does, and 
lifted me by the scruff of my neck. 
The Chief Mate picked me up and 
passed me to the Second Assistant 
Engineer. 

Sis was there, being held by the 
purser on one side and the Chief 
Computer's Mate on the other. Behind them, I could see a flock of 
wide-eyed female passengers. 

"Yqli cowards!" Sis was raging. 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

"Letting your Captain face a dangcrous outlaw all by himself!" 

"I dunno, Miss Sparling," the 
Computer's Mate said, scratching 
the miniature slide-rule insignia on 
his visor with his free hand. "The 
Old Man would'vc been willing to 
let it go with a log entry, figuring 
the spaceport paddlefeet could pry 
out the stowaway when we landed. 
But you had to quote the Mother 
Anita Law at him v and he's in there 
doing his duty. He figures the rest 
of us arc family men, too, and 
there's no sense making orphans." 

"You promised, Sis," I told her 
through my teeth. "You promised 
you wouldn't get Butt into trouble!" 

She tossed her spiral curls at me 
and ground a heel into the purser's 
instep. He screwed up his face and 
howled, but he didn't let go of her 
arm. 

"Shush, Ferdinand, this is serious !" 

It -was. I heard the Captain say, 
"I'm not carrying a weapon, 
Brown." 

"Then get one," Butt's low, lazy 
voice floated out. 

"No, thanks. You're as handy 
with that thing as I am with a 
pockctboard." The Captain's words 
got a little fainter as he walked 
forward. Butt growled like a gusher 
about to blow. 

"I'm counting on your being a 
good guy, Brown." The Captain's 
voice quavered just a bit. "I'm 
banking on what J heard about the 



blast-happy Browns every time I 
lifted gravs in New Kalamazoo; 
tfaey have a code, they don't burn 
unarmed men." 

JUST about this time, events in 
the lifeboat went down to a 
mumble. The top of my head got 
wet and I looked up. There was 
sweat rolling down the Second 
Assistant's forehead; it converged 
at his nose and bounced off the tip 
in a sizable stream. I twisted out oi 
the way. 

"What's happening?" Sis gritted, straining toward the lock. 

"Butt's trying to decide whether 
he wants him fried or scrambled." 
the Computer's Mate said, pulling 
her back. "Hey. purse, remember 
when the whole family with their 
pop at the head went into Heatwave to argue with Colonel Leclerc?" 

"Eleven dead, sixty-four injured," the purser answered mechanically. "And no more army 
stationed south of Icebox." His 
right ear twitched irritably. "But 
what 're they saying?" 

Suddenly we heard. "By authority vested in me under the Pomona 
College Treaty," the Captain was 
saying very loudly, "'I arrest you 
for violation of Articles Sixteen to 
Twenty-one inclusive of the Space 
Transport Code, and order your 
person and belongings impounded 
for the duration of this voyage as 
set forth in Sections Forty-one and 
Forty- five — " 




 



"Forty-three. and Forty-five," Sis 
groaned. "Sections 'Forty-three and 
Forty-five, I told him. I even made 
him repeat it after me!" 

" — of the Mother Anita Law, 
SC 2136, Emergency Interplanetary 
Directives." 

WE ALL waited breathlessly 
for Butt's reply. The seconds ambled on and there was no 
clatter of electrostatic discharge, no 
smell of burning flesh. 

Then we heard some feet walking. A big man in a green suit 
swung out into the crossway. That 
was Butt. Behind him came the 
Captain, holding the blaster gingerly with both hands. Butt had a 
funny, thoughtful look on his face. 

The girls surged forward when 
they saw him, scattering the crew 
to one side. They were like a school 
of sharks that had just caught sight 
of a dying whale. 



"M-m-m-m! Are all Venusians 
built like that?" 

"Men like that are worth the 
mileage!" 

"/ want him!" "I -want him!" "I 
want him!" 

Sis had been let go. She grabbed 
; my free hand and pulled me away. 
She was trying to look only 
annoyed, but her eyes had bright 
little bubbles of fury popping in 
them. 

"The cheap extroverts ! And 
they call themselves responsible 
women!" 

I was angry, too. And I let her 
know, once we were in our cabin. 
"What about that promise. Sis ? 
You said you wouldn't turn him 
in. You promised!" 

She stopped walking around the 
room as if she had been expecting 
to get to Venus on foot. "I know 
I did, Ferdinand, but he forced 
me." 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD

"My name is Ford and I don't 
understand. 

"Your name is Ferdinand and 
stop trying to act forcefully like a 
girl. It doesn't become you. 3a just 
a few days, you'll forget all this 
and be your simple, carefree self 
again. I really truly meant to keep 
my word. From what you'd told 
me, Mr. Brown seemed to be a 
fundamentally decent chap despite 
his barbaric notions on equality between the sexes — or worse. I was 
positive I could shame him into 
a more rational social behavior and 
make him give himself up. Then 
he— he— " 

She pressed her fingernails 'into 
her palms and let out a long, glaring sigh at the door. "Then he 
kissed me ! Oh, it was a good 
enough kiss — Mr. Brown has evidently had a varied and colorful 
background — ibut the galling idiocy 
of the man, trying that! I was just 
getting over the colossal impudence involved in bis proposing 
marriage — as if be had to bear the 
children! — and was considering the 
offer seriously, on its merit*, as one 
should consider all suggestions, 
when he deliberately dropped the 
pretense of reason. He appealed to 
me as most of the savage ancients 
appealed to their women, as an 
emotional machine. Throw the correct sexual switches, says this 
theory, and the female- surrenders 
herself ecstatically to the doubtful 
and bloody murk of masculine 
plans." 



THERE was a double knock on 
the door and the Captain 
walked in without waiting for an 
invitation. He was still holding 
Butt's blaster. He pointed it at me. 
"Get your hands up, Ferdinand 
Sparling," he said. 
I did. 

"I hereby order your detention 
for the duration of this voyage, for 
aiding and abetting a stowaway, as 
set forth in Sections Forty-one and 
Forty-five — " 

"Forty-three and Forty-five," Sis 
interrupted him, her eyes getting 
larger and rounder. "But you gave 
me your word of honor that no 
charges would be lodged against 
the boy!" 

"Forty-one and Forty-five," he 
corrected her courteously, still staring fiercely at me. "I looked it up. 
Of the Anita Mason Law, Emergency Interplanetary Directives. That 
was the usual promise one makes 
to an informer, but I made it before I knew it was Butt Lee Brown 
you were talking about. I didn't 
want to arrest Butt Lee Brown. 
You forced me. So I'm breaking 
my promise to yon, just as, I understand, you 'broke your promise to 
your brother. They'll both be 
picked up at New Kalamazoo 
Spaceport and sent Terraward for 
trial." 

"But I used all of our money to 
buy passage," Sis wailed. 

"And now you'll have to return 
wi th the boy. I'm s orry, Miss 
Sparling. But as you explained to 



18 




 



me, a man who has been honored 
■with an important official position 
should stay close to the letter of 
the law for the sake of other men 
who are trying to break down terrestrial anti-male prejudice. Of 
course, there's a way out." 

"There is? Tell me, please!" 

"Can I lower my hands a minute ?" I asked. 

"No, you can't, son — not according to the armed surveillance provisions of the Mother Anita Law. 
Miss Sparling, if you'd marry 
Brown — now, now, don't look at 
me like that ! — we could let the 
whole matter drop. A shipboard 
wedding and he goes on your passport as a 'dependent male member 
of family,' which means, so far as 
the law is concerned, that he had 
a regulation passport from the beginning of this voyage. ,And once 
we touch Venusian soil he can contact his bank and pay for passage. 
On the record, no crime was ever 
committed. -He's free, the boy's 
free, and you — " 

" — Are married to an uncombed 
desperado who doesn't know 
enough to sit back and let a woman 
run things. Oh, you should be 
ashamed !" 

THE Captain shrugged and 
spread his arms wide. 
"Perhaps I should be. but that's 
what comes of putting men into responsible positions, as you would 
say. See here, Miss Sparling, / 
didn't want to arrest Brown, and, 



if it's at all possible, I'd still prefer not to. The crew, officers and 
men, all go along with me. We may 
be legal residents of Earth, but our 
work requires us to be on Venus 
several times a year. We don't want 
to be disliked by any members of 
the highly irritable Brown clan or 
its collateral branches. Butt Lee 
Brown himself, for all of his savage appearance in your civilized 
eyes, is a man of much influence 
on the Polar Continent. In his own 
bailiwick, the Galertan Archipelago, 
he makes, breaks and occasionally 
readjusts officials. Then there's his 
brother Saskatchewan who considers Butt a helpless, put-upon youngster — " 

"Much influence, you say? Mr. 
Brown has ?" Sis was suddenly 
thoughtful. 

"Power, actually. The kind a 
strong man usually wields in a 
newly settled community. Besides, 
Miss Sparling, you're going to 
Venus for a husband because the 
male-female ratio on Earth is reversed. Well, not only is Butt Lee 
Brown a first class catch, but you 
can't afford to be too particular in 
any case. While you're fairly pretty, 
you won't bring any wealth into a 
marriage and your high degree of 
opinionation is not likely to be 
well-received on a backward, masculinist world. Then, too, the 
woman-hunger is not so great any 
more, what with the Marie Curie 
and the Fatima having already deposited their cargoes, the Mme. Sun 



VENUS IS A MAN'S WORLD 



Yat Sen due to . arrive next 
month ..." a , 

SIS nodded to herself, waved the 
door open, and walked out. 
"Let's hope," „the Captain said. 
"Like any father used to say, a 
man who knows how to handle 
women, how to. get around them 
without their knowing it, doesn't 
need to know anything else in this 
life. I'm plain wasted in space. 
You can lower your hands now, 
son." 

We sat down and I explained 
the blaster to him. He was very 
interested. He said all Butt had 
told him— in the lifeboat when they 
decided to use my arrest as a club 
over Sis — was to keep the safety 
catch all the way up against his 
thumb. I could see he really had 
been excited about carrying a lethal 
weapon around. He told me that 
back in the old days, captains — sea 
captains, that is — actually had the 
right to keep guns in their cabins 
all the time to put down mutinies 
and other things our ancestors did. 

The telewall flickered, and we 
turned it on. Sis smiled down. 
".Everything's all right, Captain. 
Come up and marry us, please." 

"What did you stick him for?" 
he asked. "What was the price?" 

Sis's full lips went thin and hard, 
the way Mom's used to. Then she 
thought better of it and laughed. 
"Mr. Brown is going to see that 
I'm elected sheriff of the Galertan 
Archipelago." 



"And I thought she'd settle for 
a county clerkship]" the Captain 
muttered as we spun up to the brig. 

The doors were open and girls 
were chattering in every corner. Sis 
came up to the Captain to discuss 
arrangements. I slipped away and 
found Butt sitting with folded arms 
in a comer of the brig. He grinned 
at me. "Hi, tadpole. Like the 
splash ?" 

I shook my head unhappily. 
"Butt, why did you do it? I'd sure 
love to be your brother-in-law, but, 
gosh, you didn't have to marry 
Sis." I pointed at some of the 
bustling females. Sis was going to 
have three hundred bridesmaids. 
' 'Any one of them would have 
jumped at the chance to be your 
wife. And once on any woman's 
passport, you'd be free. Why Sis?" 

"That's what the Captain said in 
the lifeboat. Told him same thing 
I'm telling you. I'm stubborn. What 
I like at first, I keep on liking. 
What I want at first, I keep on 
wanting until I get." 

"Yes, but making Sis sheriff ! 
And you'll have to back her up 
with your blaster. What "11 happen 
to that man's world?" 

"Wait'll after we nest and go 
out to my islands." He produced a 
hard-lipped, smug grin, sighting it 
at Sis's slender back. "She'll find 
herself sheriff over a bunch of natives and exactly two Earth males 
— you and me. I got a hunch that'll 
keep her pretty busy, though."
