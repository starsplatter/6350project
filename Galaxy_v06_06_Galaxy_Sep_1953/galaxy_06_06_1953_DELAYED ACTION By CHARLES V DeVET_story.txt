DELAYED ACTION By CHARLES V. DeVET 



IT was just a hunch. Johnson 
knew that, but his hunches 
had often paid off in the 
past, and now he waited with a 
big man's patience: For five hours 
he sat in the wooden stands, under the rumpled Canvas the concessionaires had put up to 
protect the tourists from Marlock's yellow sun. 

The sun was hot and soon 
Johnson's clothing Was marked 
with large soiled patches of sweat. 
Now and then a light breeze blew 
across the stands from the native 
section and at each breath his 
nostrils crinkled in protest at the 
acrid smell. 


Marlock wasn't much of a 
planet. Its one claim to fame 
was its widely advertised Nature's 
Moebius Strip. For eighteen 
months of the year — nine months 
of sub-zero cold, and nine months 
of sultry, sand-driven summer — 
the only outsiders to visit the 
planet came to buy its one export, 
the fur of the desert ox. But 
during the two months of fall 
and two months of spring the 
' tourists poured in to gape at the 
Strip. 

Idly, for the hundredth time, 
Johnson let his gaze run over 
the tourists lining up for their 
"thrill" journey out onto the 
Strip. Most of them wouldn't go 
far; they only wanted to be 
able to say they'd been on it. 
They would build up some pretty 
exciting stories about it by the 
time they returned home. 

There was no sign of Johnson's 
man. 

THE party started out onto the 
Strip. At the first sensation of 
giddiness women squealed and 
most of them turned back. Their 
men came with them, secretly 
relieved at the excuse. 

Johnson watched disinterestedly until only two remained: the 
young couple he had designated 
in his mind as honeymooners. 
The girl had grit. Perhaps more 
than the young fellow with her. 
He was affecting bored bravado, 



laughing loudly as the girl hesi- * 
tated, but white streaks had appeared along his jawline and 
across his temples as he waited 
his turn. 

The young couple had gone far 
enough out now so that they were 
in the first bend of the Strip's i 
twisting dip. Already their bodies 
were leaning sharply, as the mysterious gravity of the Strip held 
them perpendicular with their 
pathway. From where he sat 
Johnson could read nausea on 
their faces. 

When they had followed the 
Strip around until they were 
leaning at a 35-degree angle, the 
girl seemed to lose her nerve. She 
stopped and stood gripping the 
guide rope with both hands. The i 
boy said something to her, but 
she shook her head. He'd have to 
show his superiority now by going on, but it wouldn't be for 
much farther, Johnson was willing to wager. 

The boy took three more steps 
and paused. Then his body bent 
in the middle and he was sick. 
He'd had enough. 

Both turned and hurried back. 
The crowd of tourists, watching 
or waiting their turn, cheered. In 
a few minutes, Johnson knew, the 
kid would be thinking of himself 
as a hero. 

Suddenly Johnson straightened 
up, having spotted a new arrival* who gripped a tan brief


142 




 



case tightly under one arm, buying a ticket. He had bulky 
shoulders and a black beard. 
Johnson's man had come. 

When he saw the bearded man 
go out with the next bunch to 
brave the Strip, Johnson rose and 
walked rapidly to the entrance. 
Elbowing his way through, with 
a murmured apology, he joined 
the waiting group. 

A thin-faced odd-job man 
opened the rope gate and they 
shuffled through. The group must 
have walked fifty paces, with the 
bearded man well up in front and 
Johnson somewhere in the middle, before Johnson's stomach 
sent him its first warning of unrest. Most of those ahead had 
stopped and Johnson threaded 
his way carefully past them. 

Another twenty-five steps and 
he left the others behind. All except the bearded man. He neither 
paused nor looked back, 

Johnson's stomach had drawn 
up into a tight knot now, and his 
head was beginning to feel light. 
There was a faint ringing in his 
ears. 

By the time he reached the 
end of the guide rope, nausea 
was creeping up from his stomach 
and into his throat. This was as 
far as it was supposed to be safe 
to go; the advertising literature 
had it that here was the point 
of no return. Up ahead his quarry 
was walking half doubled over, 



weaving back and forth, as 
though he were intoxicated. But 
he did not pause. 

Johnson turned to look back, 
and felt his breakfast fighting to 
come up. From his perspective, 
the ground and the spectators 
watching him had swung to a 
position almost perpendicular to 
him. He felt that he was about 
to slide off into space. A wave of 
vertigo swept over him, his legs 
folded and he fell to the ground 
— sicker than he had ever been 
before in his life. Now he knew 
why the man ahead never looked 
back. 

For a moment Johnson wondered whether he should give up. 
But, even as he debated, tenacity 
pulled him to his feet and forced 
him on. 

And now something new was 
added to his vast discomfort. 
Tiny twinges of pain, like small 
electric shocks, began shooting 
up his legs, increasing in intensity 
with each step he took. The 
pain built up until the rusty taste 
of blood in his mouth told him 
that he had bitten into the flesh 
of his lower lip. 

Johnson's only consolation now 
was the thought that the man 
ahead of him must be suffering 
worse than he. At each step the 
pain increased its tempo, and the 
sound within his head grew to a 
battering roar. Although he felt 
himself at the last frayed ends 



DELAYED ACTION 



143 



of his vitality, he managed to 
stagger on. 

Abruptly he realized that he 
had very nearly overtaken the 
man ahead. Through eyes glazed 
with pain, he saw the other, still 
standing, but swaying with agony 
and sickness. The man seemed 
to be gathering his resources for 
some supreme effort. 

He tottered ahead two more 
steps, threw himself forward — 
and disappeared! 

If he paused now, Johnson 
knew he would never be able to 
move again. Only will power and 
momentum carried him on. He 
stumbled and pitched forward. 
A searing pain traced a path 
through his head and he felt himself falling. 

TTE was certain that he had 
never lost consciousness. The 
ground came up to meet him, 
and, with a last effort, he twisted 
his right shoulder inward. His 
cheek slid along the dirt and he 
lay on his side without strength. 
His legs pushed forward in a 
steady jerking movement as he 
fought to quiet his quivering 
muscles. 

Gradually a soothing lethargy 
bathed Johnson's body. His pains 
vanished, and the sickness left 
his stomach. 

But something was wrong — 
terribly wrong! 

Slowly he climbed to his feet 



and stood looking about him. He 
was still on the narrow arm of 
the Strip. On either side of him 
banks of white clouds, with the 
consistency of thick smoke, bil- ' 
lowed and curled about the Strip t 
— but somehow they left its pathway clear. 

Johnson shook his head. The 
wrongness, he guessed, was in his 
own mind. But he was unable to 
determine what it was. Desperately he marshalled his scattered 
thoughts. Nothing. He took one 
groping step in the direction from 
which he had come — and staggered back from a wall of pain 
as tangible as a concrete structure. 

He had no choice except to go 
forward. There was something he 
must do, he realized, but what 
was it? With the question came 
the answer to what was troubling 
him. 

His memory was gone! 

Or, at least, a great gap had 
been torn through it as though 
carved out by a giant blade. 
Briefly, despair threatened to 
overwhelm him. 

"Hold it!" Johnson spoke 
aloud, and the words sobered 
him. 

All fears became worse when 
not looked at. He had to bring 
this disaster out into the open 
where he could face it; where he 
could assay the damage. He had 
always taken pride in having a 



144 




 



logical mind, with thought processes as clear and orderly as a 
bookkeeper's ledger. Closing his 
eyes, he went swiftly over his 
recollections, placing each in its 
appropriate column. 

When he finished he found the 
balance extremely unfavorable, 
but not hopeless. On the asset 
side he remembered: His name. 
Donald Johnson. Right now he 
was on Nature's Moebius Strip, 
on the planet, Marlock. There 
was some man he had been following . . . The rest was on the 
liability side of his balance sheet. 

TTIS name remained: All other 
memory of his own identity 
was gone. There was no recollection of his reason for being on 
Marlock, or whom he had been 
following or why. That left him 
little with which to work. 

On the other hand, he mused, 
he might never be able to get off 
the Strip, so that didn't matter 
much. He doubted his ability to 
stand the stress of penetrating 
that electric curtain again. His 
body had been able to take the 
punishment the first time because 
the force had built up gradually. 
Going back would be something 
else again. , 

Still* he planned his next actions methodically — only in that 
way could he retain his sanity. 
He would go forward for one 
hour, he decided — he checked his 



wrist watch and discovered it 
had run down — and, if he found 
nothing, he would return and take 
his chances -on getting through 
the curtain. 

At the end of ten minutes he 
sighted land ahead of him. When 
he stepped off the Strip, he 
stopped in amazement! 

Somehow the Strip had doubled 
back on itself, and he had returned to his starting place! 

To his right was the rough 
wooden viewing platform, with 
its green umbrella gone. The 
stands were empty, and not a 
person — tourist or concessionaire 
— was in sight. 

As Johnson stood, perplexed, 
he became aware of numbness 
spreading over his body. He 
brought up his hands and watched them slowly turn blue with 
cold. He realized then, in a burst 
of wonder, that winter had come 
to Marlock. Yet it had been 
spring when he had gone out on 
the Strip! 

"|^OOD God, man!" the clerk 
exclaimed. "Have you been 
out in that cold without a coat 
and hat? It must be thirty below." 

Johnson was unable to answer. 
He had run from the Strip — 
luckily he remembered its location in relation to the town — but 
it must have been over a mile to 
the hotel. Now, as he stamped his 



DELAYED ACTION 



145 



feet and beat at his sides with 
numbed hands, he breathed heavily, gasping great gulps of air 
into his tortured lungs. 

"Come and warm yourself," 
the clerk said, leading him over 
to a hot water radiator. 

Johnson made no protest. He 
let the heat penetrate until it 
scorched the skin on his back. 
Only after the coldness left his 
body and was replaced by a 
drowsy inertia did his attention 
return to the clerk. 

"Did you ever see me before?" 
Johnson asked. 

The clerk shook his head. "Not 
that I know of." 

Any further investigation would 
have to wait until the next day, 
Johnson decided. He was dead 
tired, and he had to have some 
sleep. "Sign me up for a room, 
will you?" he asked. 

Once up in his room, Johnson 
counted his money. One hundred 
and fifty-four credits. Enough to 
buy winter clothing and pay his 
room and board for a week. 
Maybe two. What would he do 
if he could learn nothing about 
himself before then? 

The next day Johnson left the 
hotel to buy warm clothes. The 
town's only store was a half-block 
down the street — as he remembered it, one of the big Interplanet Company stores. 

Johnson waited until the storekeeper finished with two of the 



hairy-eared natives before giving 
his order. As he paid for the 
purchase, he asked: "Have you 
ever seen me before?" 

The storekeeper glanced at him 
uneasily, and shifted his feet before answering. "Am I supposed 
to have?" 

Johnson ignored the question. 
"Where can I find the manager?" 
he asked, slipping into the heavy 
coat the clerk held for him. 

"Go up that stairway by the 
door," the clerk said. "You'll 
find him in his office." 

rjlHE manager was an old man. 

Old and black, with the deep 
blackness only an Earthborn 
Negro possesses. But his eyes retained their youthful alertness. 

"Come in and sit down," he 
told Johnson as he looked up 
and saw him standing in the 
doorway. 

Johnson walked over and took 
the chair at the manager's left. 
"I've had an accident," he said, 
without preliminary, "and I seem 
to have lost my memory. Do you, 
by any chance, know who I am?" 

"PJever saw you before in my 
life," the manager answered. 
"What's your name?" 

"Don Johnson." 

"Well, at least you remember 
something," the old man said 
shrewdly. "You didn't come during the last six months, if that'll 
help any. There've been only two 



146 




 



ships in that time. Both the 
Company's. I meet all Company 
ships. If you came in during the 
tourist season I wouldn't know." 

"Where else could I make inquiries?" 

"Son," the old man said kindly, 
"there's three Earthmen on Marlock, that I know of — besides 
yourself, of course — the clerk at 
the hotel, my storekeeper, and 
myself. If you started asking 
questions at the hotel, you're at 
the end of the line now." 

Something in Johnson's expression caused the old man to go on. 
"How you fixed for money, son?" 

Johnson drew a deep breath. 
"I've got enough to last me about 
two weeks." 

The manager hesitated, and 
carefully surveyed the ceiling 
with his eyes before he spoke 
again. "I've always felt we Earthmen should stick together," he 
said. "If you want a job, I'll find 
something for you to do and put 
you on the payroll." 

Twenty minutes later Johnson 
took the job— and twenty years 
later he was still working for the 
Company. He worked for them 
until ... 

JOHNSON was glad when the 
first twinge of fear came that 
it brought no panic. Instead it 
washed through his body, sharpening his reflexes and alerting 
his muscles for action. 



He never ceased to wonder 
about this faculty he had acquired for sensing the presence 
of danger. There was no doubt 
in his mind that it had come 
into active function through the 
influence of his environment. But 
it must have been an intrinsic 
part of him even before that, 
waiting to be activated. 

A moment before he had localized the source of his uneasiness 
— an Earthman, following perhaps fifty paces behind him. The 
one quick glance Johnson had 
allowed himself told him his follower was above average in 
height, and lean — with the wiry, 
muscular command of himself 
that marked him as a man capable of well-coordinated action. 

He fought the rising force of 
the next "sand-blaster" boiling in 
from the desert, until he was unable to take a step against it. 
Then he moved behind a mudpacked arm projecting from the 
native dwelling at his right. 
Every building had one of these 
protecting arms added on; even 
the concrete buildings in the 
newer, Earth-built section of the 
city conformed to the custom. 
The sandstorms raged intermittently on Marlock through the 
entire nine month summer season, and could not be ignored, 
either by visitors or natives. 

Johnson huddled against the 
projection, but the sand whipped 



DELAYED ACTION 



147 



around the corner and pounded 
at his back. Fine grains sifted 
through his clothing and mingled 
with the clammy sweat of his 
body. He resisted the frantic 
urge to scratch his itching, tormented skin, for he knew the 
flesh would be rubbed raw in a 
minute and increase the irritation to maddening proportions. 

As the "sand-blaster" lost its 
intensity, he came out from his 
shelter and walked away as rapidly as the diminishing force of 
the wind would permit. If he 
could reach his office before his 
stalker closed in, he would be 
safe. 

Suddenly a second Earthman, 
a short length of pipe in his right 
hand, came out of a doorway 
across the street and ran toward 
him. 

Johnson realized that here 
was the source of the warning his 
intuition had sent — not the man 
behind him. 

T^OR a brief instant, he weighed 
the situation. The man was 
equipped for assault, but the 
chances were he was interested 
only in robbery. Johnson could 
probably save himself a beating 
by surrendering his money without resistance. He rejected the 
thought. A man had to live with 
his pride, and his self-respect; 
they were more necessary than 
physical well-being. Setting his 



shoulders firmly against the wall, 
he waited. 

The man slowed to a walk 
when he saw his intended victim 
on guard. Johnson had the chance 
to observe him closely. He was a 
short and dark man, heavy of 
bone, with the lower half of his 
face thickly bearded, and sweat 
making a thin glistening film on 
his high cheekbones. 

Abruptly a voice said, "I 
wouldn't touch him if I were 
you." 

Johnson followed the gaze of 
his near- attacker to his left where 
the lean man he had noted before stood with a fiat blue pistol 
pointed in their direction. He held 
the pistol like a man who knew 
how to use it. 

"A gun!" the man in the street 
gasped. "Are you crazy?" 

"Better put it away — fast," 
Johnson warned his ally. "If the 
native police catch you with that 
gun, you're in bad trouble." 

The lean man hesitated a moment, then shrugged and pocketed the gun. But he kept his 
hand in the pocket. "I can still 
use it," he said, to no one in 
particular. 

"Look, chum," the bearded 
thug grated. "You're evidently a 
stranger here. Let me give you 
a tip. If you get caught using 
a gun, or even having one on you, 
the police'll slap you in jail with 
an automatic sentence of ten 



148 




 




years. An Earthman couldn't stay 
alive in one of their so-called 
jails for a year. 

"Now I've got a little business 
to attend to with Mr. Johnson, 
and I don't want any interference. 
So be smart and run along." 

The smile never left the stranger's face. "Right now," he said, 
"I am interested in seeing that 
Mr. Johnson remains in good 
health. If you take another step 
toward him, I'll shoot. And, if 
I'm not successful in evading the 
police afterwards, you won't be 
alive to know it." 

"You're bluffing," the bearded 
man said. "I . . ." 

"Let me point out something," 
Johnson interrupted. "Suppose he 
is bluffing and doesn't use the 
gun: The odds are still two to 
one against you. Are you sure 
you could handle both of us — 
even with the help of that pipe?" 

The man wasn't sure. He stood 
undecided, then his face showed 
black frustration. He mouthed a 
few choice phrases through his 
beard, turned and walked away. 

rilHE lean man extended his 
hand. "My name's Alton 
Hawkes." 

The rising whine of the next 
"sand-blaster" drowned out Johnson's answer. He drew his new 
acquaintance into the shelter of 
a sand -arm. 

As they hugged the corner, 



DELAYED ACTION 



149 



they felt a third body press 
against them. The musky odor, 
mingled with the taint of old 
leather, told Johnson that their 
companion was a native. 

The storm eased its force and 
the two Earthmen raised their 
heads to regard the corner's other 
occupant. He was a mahogany 
brown, almost the exact color of 
the ankle -length leather skirt he 
wore. "Man, he stinks!" Hawkes 
said. 

Their .visitor spread his hairy, 
wide-nostriled nose into the native equivalent of a smile. His 
hairy ears twitched with pleasure 
and he swelled his chest. "Blee 
strong all over," he said. "Want 
him guard?" 

"Why not?" Johnson answered, 
glancing inquiringly at Hawkes. 
He slipped a coin into the extended brown palm. "Guard us 
until we get to the big-house 
section." 

"Pale-smells be very safe," the 
native said. 

They left their shelter as the 
wind died down and started toward the taller buildings of the 
foreign section. "I must have said 
the right thing when I said he 
stinks," Hawkes remarked. 

"Telling a native that is the 
same thing, to him, as caltfng 
him strong and virile," Johnson 
answered. "They admit, reluctantly, that we foreigners have 
some good fighting qualities, but 



we're still regarded as unmanly 
because of our weak odor. Their 
females wouldn't look twice at 
either of us." 

When they reached one of the 
few three-story structures in the 
city, Johnson dismissed their 
guard. They entered the building 
and walked down a short corridor 
and through a door lettered : 

DONALD H. JOHNSON 
District Manager 
Interplanets Trade Company 

"To be frank w'ith you," 
Hawkes said, as he eased his 
lank body into the chair Johnson offered, "I had planned to 
learn more about your local activities before I introduced myself. However, I've found in the 
past that my first judgment of a 
man is usually right, so I think 
I'll get down to business immediately." He drew a set of 
papers from an inside pocket 
and tossed them on the desk in 
front of Johnson. "I'm a Company Secret Service man," he 
said. 

JOHNSON raised his eyebrows, 
but looked at the papers 
without comment. He glanced up 
at Hawkes. 

"Do you recognize either of the 
men in the pictures?" Hawkes 
asked, when he saw that Johnson had no intention of speaking. 



150 




 



Unhurriedly Johnson picked up 
the papers and removed a rubber binder. He pulled out two 
photos and laid them on the desk 
in front of him. "The bearded 
one is the man who waylaid me," 
he said. "Of course." 

"Look at both a little closer," 
Hawkes suggested, "and see if 
you don't notice something else." 

Johnson studied the pictures. 
"There's no doubt about the 
first,'" he murmured. "Evidently 
I'm supposed to recognize the 
other also." Abruptly he sat erect. 
"They're both the same man," 
he exclaimed. "Only in the second picture h^'s clean-shaven." 

Hawkes nodded. "There's a 
story about those two pictures," 
he said. "But first, let me fill you 
in on some background. You 
know that Interplanets has 
branches on more than a thousand worlds. Because of this widespread operation it's particularly 
vulnerable to robbery. But it 
would cost more than the Company's earnings to post adequate 
guards on every station. And it 
would be impractical to depend 
on the protection of the local 
governments, many of which are 
extremely primitive. On the other 
hand, allowing themselves to be 
robbed with impunity would be 
financial suicide." 

•Johnson nodded. "Of course." 

"That," Hawkes continued, "is 
where the Company's Secret 



Service comes in. It never lets up 
on the effort it will make to solve 
a robbery and bring the perpetrators to justice. And it never 
quits, once it begins an investigation. That policy has proven very 
effective in discouraging thievery. 
During the Company's entire 
tenure there have been less than 
a dozen unsolved thefts — and two 
of them occurred right here on 
Marlock." 

"I was a clerk with the Company at the time of the second," Johnson said reminiscently. 
"Been with them about .three 
years then. That must have been 
over twenty years ago. I . . ." He 
paused and looked down. "I remember," he said. "The picture 
without the beard . . . That's the 
thief. The photograph "was taken 
by one of the automatic cameras 
set up for just that purpose; 
we still use them. But they never 
found the man." 

"That's right," Hawkes agreed. 
"That robbery occurred a little 
over twenty years ago. And the 
other picture you have was taken 
at the time of the first robbery — 
approximately twenty-five years 
before that." 

"But it isn't possible," Johnson 
protested. "These pictures are of 
the same man. And there's obviously no twenty-five year 
spread in age between them. Unless . . ." 

"Unless one is the other's 



0E1AYED ACTION 



151 



father, or a relative that resembles him very closely?" Hawkes 
finished. "Look at the pictures 
again. There's the same scar on 
both foreheads, the same pockmark on the right cheek; our special section has even made measurements of the comparative sizes 
of the nose, ears and other features. There's no possible doubt 
that the pictures are of the same 
man," 

"TTOW do you explain it?" 
Johnson asked. 

"I don't," Hawkes replied 
quietly. "That's one of the things 
I'm here to learn. But did you 
notice this? The man we encountered this afternoon was not 
only the same as the one on those 
pictures: he still looks the same. 
JiVe might, for the sake of argument, grant that a man's appearance would change only 
slightly in twenty-five years. But 
when you add another twentythree on top of that — and he's 
still unchanged . . . ?" 

"If you're certain that he's the 
man, why don't you arrest him?" 
Johnson asked: 

"Can we arrest a man apparently about thirty years old and 
accuse him of a crime committed 
forty-eight years ago— or even 
twenty-three years ago?" 

"I suppose not," Johnson 
agreed. "What do you intend to 
do?" 



"I haven't decided yet. First 
I'll have to learn more about the 
situation here. You can help me 
with that. Right now I'd like to 
know something about the native 
customs— especially in regard to 
legal matters." i 

"Their laws are fairly simple," 
Johnson began. "There's no law 
against stealing or taking by 
force anything you can get away 
with. That sounds absurd by I 
Earth standards, it prevents the j 
amassing of more goods than an « 
individual needs, and makes for i 
fairly equitable distribution. If a ] 
native somehow acquires a sudden amount of wealth — goods, in 
their case — he must hire guards 
to protect it. Guarding is a ma- J 
jor occupation. They do aa espe- | 
cially big business during the ' 
tourist seasons. In time the pay 
of the guards will eat up any native's surplus. Either way — by 
loss or guard pay — the wealth is 
soon redistributed." 

"Can they even kill one another with impunity?" J 

"No. Their laws are rigid in 
that respect. In the process of — relieving another of his property, 
they must neither break a major 
bone, nor inflict permanent damage. If they disobey, they are 
tortured to death in the public 
square." 

Hawkes asked, "Who enforces 
their law?" 

"One of the clans. Its members 



152 




 



are supported in their duties by 
all the others. And there's a 
permanent open season on murderers. Anyone, police or civilian 
may revenge a victim." 

"How about the law against 
carrying firearms?" 

"With them, intent is tantamount to commission," Johnson 
replied. "Only foreigners are ever 
foolish enough to be caught 
armed. However, all native laws 
apply to them also. The only 
concession the Company has been 
able to force is that a foreign 
offender isn't tortured: He's put 
in jail for ten years. None ever 
ljve to come out." 

"I see," Hawkes said. "Interesting. However, the immediate 
situation is this. I've been sent 
here because the Service received 
reports that our bearded friend 
had made another appearance. 
And we believe it's safe to assume that he's here to attempt 
a third robbery. Right now we'll 
have to pass over his trick of 
longevity. Our problem is to catch 
him in the act. When do you 
think he'll make his play?" 

"It'll have to be some time before tomorrow nooni" Johnson 
answered. "Under our setup we 
accept furs from the natives 
whenever they're brought in. But 
we pay off only once a year. That 
way I'm not burdened with 
guarding money the whole year 
around. I have well over fifty 



thousand credits in the safe now. 
And tomorrow I begin paying 
off." 

"Then we'll have to be ready 
for him," Hawkes said, "though 
I don't expect him until tonight. 
Probably just about the time 
you're ready to close. He'll need 
you to open the safe. I can count 
on your help?" 

Johnson nodded. 

ri^HAT night as they waited in 
his office, Johnson turned to 
Hawkes. "I've been giving some 
thought to what you told me this 
afternoon about the robberies. I 
have a theory that might account 
for some of the things we don't 
understand." 

"Yes?" Hawkes looked closely 
at Johnson. 

"You've probably heard of our 
tourist attraction called Nature's 
Moebius Strip? As far as we 
know, no one has ever gone beyond a certain point — and returned. Suppose there's a time 
flaw at that point — and the 
bearded man has somehow 
learned about it. Suppose anyone completing the Moebius circle, and returning, finds — say, 
twenty years have elapsed, while 
to him only a few minutes have 
passed?" 

"Go on." Hawkes leaned forr 
ward intently. 

"He makes his first holdup," 
Johnson continued, "and goes

around the Strip. When he comes 
out twenty years later they're no 
longer looking for him. He leaves 
Marlock, and during the next 
five years he goes through the 
money he stole. He returns and 
repeats the process. This time the 
money lasts only three years. 
Now he's back to try it again. 
Do you see how that would tie 
everything up in a neat little 
package?" 

Hawkes smiled, as he relaxed 
and sat back. "A bit too neat," he 
said. "Also, you don't have an 
ounce of concrete evidence to 
back up your theory." 

"That's right. I don't," Johnson agreed. 

Outside the door a board 
creaked. Johnson glanced quickly 
across the room to where Hawkes 
sat with a pistol on his lap. 
Hawkes' eyebrows raised, but he 
made no sound: 

SUDDENLY the door was 
^ kicked open and the blackbearded stranger stood framed in 
the doorway. "Raise 'em!" he 
barked. The gun in his hand was 
aimed at Johnson. 

The man took two steps into 
the room. Hawkes shifted slightly 
in his chair and the gunman's 
head swiveled in his direction. 
The slug from Hawkes' pistol 
made a small blue hole in the 
upper left corner of his forehead. 

The thug's face tipped up, 



DELAYED ACTION 



155 



shocked and unbelieving. He 
swayed slowly before he fell 
backward, his body rigid. His fur 
cap flew from his head as he 
struck the floor. 

"I thought we'd better play it 
safe," Hawkes said as he rose and 
walked over to the fallen man. 
He slipped his gun into his pocket 
before he bent and picked up the 
cap at his feet. He dropped it 
over the upturned face. 

For a long moment the silence 
held thin as the two men looked 
at each other. Hawkes stood, wiping his right hand on his trouser 
leg. Johnson toyed idly with the 
gun he had picked up from the 
desk in front of him. 

Finally Hawkes let his body 
sag into a chair at Johnson's, 
right. "This is always a dirty 
business," he said sourly. 

Johnson sat down also. "Did 
you notice the look on his face 
when he saw you, and you shot 
him?" he asked, abstractedly 
turning the pistol in his hand. 
"Funny thing. In that half-second 
before he fell an article I read 
somewhere flashed into my mind. 
It seems that during the French 
Revolution a certain doctor got 
to wondering just how long a 
man's brain remained active after 
his head had been cut off. He persuaded some of his friends who 
were due to be guillotined to cooperate in a series of tests. Each 
man was to keep blinking his 



eyes as long as possible after his 
head left his body, as a sign that 
he was still conscious. The doctor counted as high as six winks." 

"Very interesting, I'm sure," 
Hawkes said guardedly. "But a 
bit morbid, isn't it?" 

"I was wondering," Johnson 
went on as though he had not 
heard the other, "whether he 
was still conscious for that instant after you shot him. And if 
that brought the look of surprise 
to his face." 

TJAWKES turned in his chair to 
face Johnson fully. "You're 
driving at something," he said 
sharply. "Get to the point." 

"Personally I've wondered at a 
few things about you myself," 
Johnson said. He held the gun 
steadily in his hand now, no 
longer pretending to play with it. 
"I told you that our second robbery occurred while I was a clerk 
with the Company," he went on. 
"They jerked me in to the Home 
Office, and for a while I had a 
pretty rough time . . . You know, 
when I joined the Company, I 
was an amnesiac. I remembered 
my name, but that's about 
all . . ." 

"No, I didn't know," Hawkes 
muttered, growing slightly paler. 

"I learned then from the Home 
Office that I had been a member 
of their Secret Service some 
twenty years earlier. I'd been sent 



156 




 



here to investigate the first robbery. And I had disappeared. 
Naturally, they had , suspected 
me. 

"However, they had no evidence, and when I reappeared 
twenty years later they played it 
smart by just waiting, instead of 
arresting me. When the second 
robbery occurred, they closed in. 

"The only thing that saved me 
was the fact that tests proved my 
memory was really gone, and 
that I had told the truth— as I 
knew it. From the few scraps of 
information I retained — about 
being out on the Moebius Strip — 
they and I arrived at the theory 
I mentioned a short time ago. I 
was sent back here to wait. The 
Company never gives up. Remember?" 

"Are you insinuating that I was 
in cahoots with this fellow here?" 
Hawkes asked harshly. 

"I'd say it was more than an 
insinuation," Johnson replied. 
"You made several other slips. 
In the first place, Secret Service 
men are usually better informed 
about a situation they're investigating than you seemed to be. 
Also, those identification papers 
you showed me were faked." 

'T'HE skin along the bridge of 
Hawkes' hose had drawn 
tight, and now his lips grew narrower. "In that case, why did I 
save you from that man this 



afternoon?" he asked. "And why 
would I shoot him now?" 

"Your saving me was an act, 
to get into my confidence. You 
shot him so you wouldn't have to 
split the loot. I figure you were in 
with him on the second robbery 
also. There had to be someone 
because his memory would be 
gone, when he came off the Strip. 
But you weren't satisfied. Together you decided to pull off another robbery while you were 
here and double the spoils. Then 
you decided you wanted it all for 
yourself and you shot him." 

"There's one big flaw in your 
reasoning," Hawkes pointed out. 
"How did I plan to get away? 
The only ships leaving here for 
several months belong to the 
Company. Do you think I'd be 
foolish enough to expect them to 
let me slip out on one of their 
ships?" 

"No. I think you intended to 
go out on the Strip yourself." 

"All right then," Hawkes countered. "You admitted that this 
was a two-man job. How could I 
protect myself when I returned, 
if I knew in advance that I 
wouldn't know who I was, let 
alone what I had done?" 

"I'll come back, to that in a 
minute," Johnson said. "But now 
I'd advise you to drop your gun 
on the floor and give yourself up. 
You've got nothing to gain by 
carrying on the bluff. You know 



DELAYED ACTION 



157 



I'll never let you get to the Strip. 
And, once I put you on the ship, 
the Company will take over." 

HAWKES' shoulders drooped. 
Finally he smiled raggedly. 
"There's no use my arguing any 
longer," he said. "But you've 
made the mistake of underestimating me, my friend. I've 
lost my gamble. That's all. You 
have nothing on me. I'm not as 
ignorant of native law as I may 
have pretended. Granted, I am 
carrying a lethal weapon. But I'm 
on private property. That's legal. 
I shot a man. But only in defense 
of my own life. His gun , on the 
floor will prove he came in armed. 
So I'm clean as far as the natives 
are concerned. l£ight?" 
Johnson nodded. 
"And, as for the Company, 
what will they hold me for? They 
can't prove any connection between me and him." Hawkes indicated the man on the floor. 
"And this robbery — it never actually came off. Earth laws don't 
allow prosecution for intent. 
Now, where does that leave 
you?" 

Johnson stood up. "You're 
right — as far as you went," he 
said. "But, returning to your earlier question about one man pulling this job, I asked myself how 
I would do it, if it had to be done 
alone. And I found a way. You'd 
probably figure the same one. 



Now I'll take that paper in your 
pocket. It will serve very well 
as a confession." 

Suddenly Hawkes' right hand 
streaked toward a side pocket. 
Johnson leaned forward and 
brought the flat of his gun across 
the other's temple. 

As Hawkes sagged, Johnson 
ripped open his coat and took out 
a sealed envelope. He removed a 
sheet of paper and read: 

This has been written tot my own 
information. My name is Alton 
Hawkes. I have robbed the Interplanets Company and gone out on the 
Strip with the money. When I read 
this my memory will be gone and 
twenty years will have elapsed.
