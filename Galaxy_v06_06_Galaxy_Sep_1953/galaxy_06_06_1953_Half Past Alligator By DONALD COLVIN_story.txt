Half Past Alligator By DONALD COLVIN 



BILL BRADLEY shooed 
away the group of Quxas 
that had surged over the 
first-base line. With broad grins 
on their flat, piebald faces, they 
moved away — in the wrong direction, of course — and squatted in 



a smiling semicircle around Pat 
Reed, who was playing third. 
This was bad, because Reed was 
a fifty-fifty player: It was an 
even chance whether he got the 
ball or the ball got him. One of 
the half-domesticated thrags 

broke loose and cantered across 
the outfield with its peculiar fivelegged gait. In the hubbub, Ray 
Bush stole second. Nobody seemed to notice. 

Sighing heavily, Bill returned 
to the mound and whiplashed in 
a fast one, tight across the letters. 
The hitter got only a small piece 
of it; a pop fly sauntered toward 
left field. Judging it to a nicety, 
Gust Mustas came racing in, 
evaded a tethered thrag, leaped 
a hole some Quxa had dug and 
forgotten, and made a shoestring 
catch, retiring the side. The 
Quxas cheered deliriously. 

Bill trotted off the mound. For 
a moment, the thrill of the game 
held him. This was the way 
things should be: The feel of 
* smoothly flowing muscles, the 
thudding sound of horsehide hitting a leather glove, the weight of 
a bat in your hands in your first 
ball game after clambering over 
and scrabbling in an unexplored 
planet for fourteen months. 

Then he caught sight of Candace Mathews, walking among 
the pneuma-huts that served as 
the outpost camp for the expedition. Gloom enveloped him again, 
surrounding him like a dank fog. 

17'OR fourteen long months, Bill 
had feasted on the memory of 
Candy Mathews, on his recollection of her torquoise eyes and 
cascading brown hair, on the re


membrance of her soft lips on his 
last night under the four moons 
of Vensor III. 

Today she had arrived with 
the seventy-odd men and women 
who comprised the appraisal unit, 
the final group of the planet's explorers. He had looked forward 
like a schoolboy to her coming. 
And, like a schoolboy, he had 
suffered black despair when his 
dreams were shattered. 

For the Candy Mathews who 
got off the shuttlebug at Camp 
Outpost was not the Candy 
Mathews who had said soft 
words on Vensor III. She was, 
instead, a self-assured young woman, somehow harder, who felt 
only an indifferent tolerance toward a tall young man named 
Bill Bradley, and an all-consuming, hero-worshiping infatuation 
for a newcomer, a dapper walking 
brain, Vance Montgomery, one 
of the council's smart boys, with 
the title of planet evaluator. 

"He's simply wonderful," she 
had said. And the joy of life had 
gone out of Bill Bradley. 

The appraisal group brought 
in athletic equipment and Bill's 
men spontaneously declared a 
holiday, their first on the planet. 
Baseball was the order of the 
afternoon and they shanghaied a 
not unwilling Bill to pitch. He 
should, he knew, be laying out 
reports for Montgomery to study. 
He did not particularly want to 



HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



127 



be with Montgomery. 

Bill sat on the xetal log that 
served as a bench. 

One Quxa was bent over, examining first base. He made a 
colorful sight. The first baseman 
slapped him jovially on the loin 
cloth to move him. 

The owner of the thrag caught 
up to it and was struggling manfully to lead it away. The fivelegged beast defied his efforts, 
rearing and dragging him. A dozen Quxas stood nearby. Their 
sympathies were obviously with 
their fellow-Quxa, but they made 
no move to help him. 

Reed was on the bench next to 
Bill. He had come in with the 
appraisal group. 

"Your vivid friends," he said, 
cocking a thumb at the Quxas, 
"don't appear too bright." 

"They're smart enough," said 
Bill. "Almost as intelligent as we 
are. It's just that they've never 
risen above a herd culture." 

"Look," said Reed. "I'm a silviculturist. Give me a hunk of 
wood and I can tell how long it 
took to grow, what it's good for, 
where it can be raised and how 
much board and profit can be 
made out of it. But this kind of 
talk throws me. Try another 
wave-length." 

"Socially, they're like the seals 
or penguins back on Earth. They 
like to gather in groups. The 
things they can do individually, 



they do well. But they don't 
know how to help each other. 
That's beyond them." 

"Don't understand the meaning of cooperation?" 

"The word isn't even in their 
language. I've seen forty of them 
standing around, fretting and 
stewing, while the horals killed 
off one of their fellows." 

"What are horals?" 

"The other dqminant life-form 
here. Nasty brutes, like big upright ants with tentacles. Stand 
about as high as my chest. Most 
malignant things I've seen. One 
Quxa can handle any horal, maybe even two or three. But the 
horals hunt in packs. Good-by 
Quxa." 

"Killing them off, are they?" 

"This is the last big concentration the Quxas have left. In another hundred years, there'll be 
no more Quxas." 

TPHEY looked again at the na■■- tives. The Quxas were something to see — human in form, although somewhat shorter than 
Earthmen; their skins were 
blotched and dashed with patches 
of vivid colors. Antiquarians 
talked of their resemblance to 
the ancient circus clowns, a likeness furthered by their broad, flat 
faces and habitual grins. 

"Sort of hate to see them 
disappear," Bill said glumly. 
"They're happy, good-natured 



128 




 



creatures. In their whole race, I 
know only one who's mean. We've 
done our best to help them. But 
if they won't cooperate even in 
a matter of life and death, what 
incentive can you offer them?" 

An elbow dug into him. 

"Up to the platter, dream boy," 
said Gust Mustas. "A hit means 
two runs." 

Selecting a bat, Bill made his 
way to the plate. In the middle 
distance, Vance Montgomery 
emerged from a hut. Candy went 
to him eagerly, put a hand on 
his arm. A deep rage engulfed 
Bill. 

The first pitch was a curve that 
failed to break. As it came fatly 
over the plate, Bill swung angrily. The ball rocketed up and 
away, past the infield, over the 
head of the desperately running 
left-fielder and dropped toward 
a sure home run. 

Then a curious thing happened. One of the Quxas darted away 
from the gabbling group along 
the foul line, his short legs churning over the uneven ground. As 
the ball sank, he dove, plucked it 
out of the air with one broad 
hand, turned a somersault and 
came up with it, grinning. It was 
an impossible catch and the 
Earthmen joined the Quxas in 
applause. Still clinging to the 
ball, the Quxa made little bobbing bows of acknowledgment. 

"Throw it in!" shouted Bill. 




HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



129 



The Quxa stood motionless. 
"Throw it in, Adlaa!" Bill urged. 
He went through a throwing motion. 

The Quxa nodded comprehension. He went into a violent windup. His left foot came up, his 
upper body went back, his right 
arm snapped in an arc. The ball 
flew from his hand, straight and 
fast. 

In the wrong direction, of 
course. 

The pack of Quxas pelted after 
it, shouting, picked it up and 
threw again. To his surprise, Bill 
found himself pounding after 
them, bawling fruitless pleas, 
aware that he looked foolish, but, 
in his rage, not caring. He closed 
in on them on the fifth throw and 
his fingertips touched the ball. He 
succeeded only in deflecting it. 
There was a dull thunk and the 
game was over. The ball had 
struck Vance Montgomery, planet evaluator, squarely in the left 
eye. 

Three things were said then to 
Bill Bradley. 

One was by Montgomery as he 
handed back the ball. "I was not 
aware, Bradley, that the job of 
camp leader entailed joining the 
rowdyism of the native races." 

One was by Candy Mathews, 
hopping with anger. "You're a 
barbarian, Bill Bradley. Monty 
might have been badly hurt." 

The third was by a clot of 



Quxas, crowding eagerly. "Play 
ball! Billbrad, more play ball!" 

To the first two, Bill did not 
reply. To the Quxas, he said one 
word, "Nuts!" and dolefully followed Montgomery into the headquarters hut. 

IN spite of his natural prejudice 
against Montgomery, Bill Wfts 
forced into a reluctant admiration 
for the way the man worked. 

Montgomery's task was to recommend whether the planet 
should be marked for immediate 
colonization, placed on a reserve 
list for future expansion, or be 
left strictly alone as unworthy of 
occupancy. He tore through Bill's 
reports like a small child through 
a bag of jellybeans. His questions, if pompous, were pointed. 

Within twenty -four hours, 
ready to leave for the main camp, 
he called a conference. 

He stood before the group, as 
dapper as a man can be with a 
rainbow bruise under one eye, 
complacently listening to the resonance of his own voice. Beside 
him, Candy nodded worshipful 
agreement. Bill grumped in a 
corner. 

For a full forty-five minutes, 
Montgomery outlined additional 
data he wanted gathered. His 
voice was faintly chiding, implying, by its tone that anybody but 
a dolt would have obtained the 
information long ago. 



130 




 



"And now," he said, "we come 
to the question of the humanoid 
denizens of this planet — the socalled Quxas." He fingered his 
black eye. "Many persons might 
conclude that the Quxas are not 
worth saving; and in themselves, 
they are not. However, my preliminary conclusions — based, unfortunately, on insufficient data 
— lead me to believe that this 
planet will be used for colonization in about five hundred years. 
It would be very convenient then 
to have a dominant life-form 
friendly to the galactic humans 
and capable of being integrated 
with the colonists. Some method 
of preserving the Quxas must 
therefore be worked out. In this, 
the advance group has failed lamentably." 

He paused, glanced around triumphantly. 

"How do I propose to achieve 
this? By a historical method. 
What do nations do when they 
are in peril? They call upon a 
single man, place themselves 
under him and let him lead them 
out. When the ancient western 
civilization was in its greatest 
danger after the fall of Rome, the 
people gathered around the strong 
men, made them kings and dukes 
and earls, and were saved from 
barbarism. 

"I shall do the same for the 
Quxas. The Quxas shall have a 
king." 



His eyes sought out Bill. 

"My acquaintance here has 
been short. I must rely on advice. 
Bradley, whom would you recommend as king of the Quxas?" 

"Well," said Bill slowly, 
"Moahlo is the most intelligent. 
He's good-natured and kindly. 
He has a lot of artistic ability. N 
Some of his carvings are being 
taken back for the Galactic Folk 
Museum." 

"An artist!" said Montgomery 
in disgust. "Well, let's have a 
look at him." 

Tty|OAHLO was finishing a figu■"-■■rine near one of the meandering paths that the Quxas had 
worn by habit, not design. A bemused group of natives looked 
on admiringly. 

Down the path came Ratakka, 
the biggest of the Quxas, his 
shoulders proudly back, his face 
set in the truculent scowl. Bill 
knew and disliked him, and apprehensively felt sure the peaceful scene would be destroyed. 
Alone of an amiable, tolerant 
race, Ratakka was perpetually 
ill-tempered, the rankling product of Lord knew what alien 
genetic accident or trauma. 

Ratakka found his path obstructed by the carving. Callously, he brought his foot down on 
the delicate figurine, crushing it 
to splinters. Moahlo sprang up in 
gentle protest. Ratakka gave him 



HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



131 



the back of a meaty hand that 
knocked him off his feet. Two 
spectators indicated disapproval. 
Ratakka smashed their heads together and strode on. 

"To save a culture, Bradley," 
said Montgomery, who had 
watched the brutal display with 
admiration, "you need strength, 
not delicacy or feeling. That man 
shall be king of the Quxas." 

He ran after Ratakka. 

The members of the outpost 
staff looked at Bill in dismay. 
He shrugged sadly and walked 
out of the headquarters hut. At 
the doorway, Adlaa was waiting 
for him with' the same old plea. 

"Play ball?" he begged. "More 
play ball, Billbrad?" 

In his despondent mood, Bill 
did not care. 

"All right. I'll throw the ball 
to you and you throw it back to 
me." 

"Quxas not do that." 

"It's just as much fun to throw 
the ball in one direction as in any 
other direction," Bill explained 
patiently. "Unless you throw it 
back, forget it — no play ball." 

Adlaa thought seriously. "Hunky dokey. Want play ball." 

They were tossing it back and 
forth in the middle of a cheering 
group when a half-track passed, 
taking Montgomery, Candy and 
Ratakka to the main camp. The 
look that the girl gave Bill was 
disdainful. 



"There's a gaggle of natives 
outside in assorted shades," said * 
Pat Reed the next day. "They .want to play ball. Moahlo's at . 
their head. He carved a bat." 

"Tell them to beat it. We're 
busy." 

"Let's give them some fun 
while we can. They won't enjoy 
life much after King Rat gets 
back here." 

"That's the truth," Bill agreed. 
"All right." 

"T WISH your painted idiots 
-■■ would get over their baseball mania," complained Rudy 
Peters, the mineralogist, two days 
later. "Look me over carefully, 
will you, Bill? I think my throwing arm just dropped off." 

"They're nutty about it, all 
right," Bill Bradley said. "Too 
bad it couldn't have been about 
something with some economic 
value." 

"Economic value, the man 
wants. Okay, I'll talk economic 
value to you. Bet you fifty units 
I can make a better ball team out 
of these freaks than you can." 

"Well, make it thirty." 

"You're on, sucker. I've lined 
up the sweetest shortstop that 
ever spit in a glove . . ." 

"Here's your thirty," said Rudy 
Peters a week after. "How was I 
to know that- shortstop wouldn't 
throw the ball to anyone except 
the center -fielder?" 



132 




 



"Team play's the stuff, lad," 
said Bill Bradley. "Stress team 
play. Twenty-five, twenty-seven, 
twenty-nine, thirty. Exactly 
right. Another lesson at the same 
price?" 

He was refused, but never on 
an exploration had Bill Bradley 
had so much fun. And never, he 
reminded himself grimly, had he 
got so little work done. The 
Quxas were neglecting their 
skimpy food plots in their eagerness to play. They were getting 
lean. Finally, with reluctance, 
Bill called a temporary halt to 
baseball. 

"Billbrad say no baseball until 
work done," said Moahlo sadly 
to Adlaa. "Sometimes Billbrad 
talk like souythpaw pitcher." 

Adlaa was trying to cultivate 
his food plot with the help of a 
thrag. The beast was of independent mind. It dragged Adlaa 
in eccentric ovals, in defiance of 
agricultural needs. 

"Adlaa want finish work, play 
baseball," the Quxa commented. 
"Thrag no play baseball, say nuts 
to work. Adlaa be old like Old 
Hoss Radbourne before work 
done." 

Moahlo contemplated. "Adlaa 
have trouble his thrag. Moahlo 
have trouble his. Moahlo help 
Adlaa his thrag and Adlaa help 
Moahlo his. Get work done more 
faster." 

Adlaa dismissed the revolu


tionary thought. "Quxas not do." 

"We play baseball run down 
play," argued Moahlo. "Play together. You throw ball me. I 
throw ball you. Yippee. Man 
out." 

"Same team. Old pals. Want 
sing team song?" 

"Want play team with thrag." 

Adlaa considered the matter in 
this new light. "Like ball game," 
he said at last in amazement. 

"Sure. You, me be us together. 
Make thrag look like busher." 

They both took hold of the 
thrag. Unable to resist their combined strengths, the beast submitted docilely. They began to 
work. 

GLANCING out from his labor 
in the headquarters pneumahut, Bill saw the incident in happy surprise. Perhaps, after all, 
his stay here might produce 
something to help the culture 
that Montgomery would introduce upon his return. He had no 
doubt of Montgomery's success. 

Neither., for that matter, had 
Montgomery. At the main camp, 
things were going swimmingly. 

The camp lay on the very 
fringe of the Quxa territory, but, 
by an arduous hunt, Ratakka had 
captured eight wandering Quxas 
to whom he immediately set 
about teaching the duties of subjects. His method was simple — 
the Quxa followed his orders, 



HALF P*AST ALLIGATOR 



133 



which he obtained from Montgomery, or the Quxa was knocked 
down, If he still refused, he was 
knocked down again. Within 
three weeks, Ratakka had them 
doing things no Quxas ever had 
done before. They performed 
them reluctantly and sullenly, 
but they did them. 

Seeing the result, but not the 
means, Candy was enthusiastic. 

"They're working together!" 
she cried. "Oh, Monty, what will 
the Quxas do to reward you?" 

"Oh, they'll probably make a 
culture god of me," said Montgomery, managing to look modest. "Like the Greeks did to that 
Martian, Proma Ss Thaa", who 
taught them the use of fire." 

As time went on, though, the 
girl began to have doubts. 

"But they're doing everything 
for Ratakka," she protested. "As 
far as they're concerned themselves, they're more wretched 
than before." 

"That's the way feudal cultures are built, my dear," Montgomery assured her. "The king 
gives them law and a fighting 
leader. In return, the subjects 
take care of his bodily comfort." 

"But they look so unhappy!" 

"In saving an inferior race, we 
cannot be concerned too much 
about the happiness of a few 
miserable members. Perhaps in 
three hundred years or so, they 
can afford happiness." 



And finally an incident happened to complete her disillusionment. 

One of Ratakka's morose subjects managed to slip the shackles with which he was bound at 
night and make a bolt for freedom. The king pursued him relentlessly, brought him back and 
then beat him, coldly and cruelly, 
slugging and gouging and kicking. 

Ashen-faced, Candy moved to 
interfere; Montgomery restrained 
her. 

"We're saving a race," he said. 
"You can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs." 

Candy turned and ran sobbing 
to her quarters, unable to dispel 
the memory of the writhing body 
on the ground. 

HPHE next day was the day to 
move equipment. It was a 
policy of the expeditions to leave 
their wornout machines for the 
most friendly of the native races, 
who could dismantle them and 
use the parts. The equipment not 
worth toting back to Earth was 
to be taken to the advance camp, 
where the Quxa center was. 
Montgomery also planned that 
day to take Ratakka to his kingdom. 

A few minutes ahead of the 
motorcade, Candy slipped out, 
got into a battered half-track 
and started driving the eighty 



134 



GALAXY SCIENCE flCTION 



miles to the advance camp. For 
the first twenty-five miles, she 
told herself that her eagerness 
was because it was a nice day 
and she wanted to get out of 
camp. 

For the next twenty-five miles, 
she called herself a liar. 

For the third twenty-five miles 
she gave herself up unashamedly 
to thinking about Bill Bradley: 
his smile, his gentleness, the awkward grace of his lean boc'y. Not 
a man to set a planet on fire -but 
how pleasant and restful to have 
around! 

She wondered if he would forgive the way she had acted. Somehow she was sure he would. 

The narrow vehicular trail ran 
through a grove of fernlike trees. 
It's just over the rise, Candy 
thought, just over the rise and 
down into the saucer, where Bill 
is waiting ... 

The half-track struck a rock, 
lurched, threw a tread and went 
off the road, out of control. 

That did not matter especially, 
for the Quxas could use the material very well where it was. 
Candy went forward briskly 
afoot. A fallen branch brushed 
her ankle. Unheedingly, she kicked it away. She began to reconstruct Bill, feature by feature: 
the way his hair swirled on his 
forehead; his eyebrows, arched 
and regular; his eyes, wide, deepseated, with inner pools of mer


riment; his nose, straight and 
rather . . . 

Another branch caught her. 
She lifted her foot to free it. It 
did not come free. Another tentacle moved around her, pinioning her right arm to her side. She 
whirled in terror and found herself in the grip of the horals. 

THERE were a dozen of the 
horrors, their antenna ears 
erect, mandibles open. They exuded an acid odor, a sign of hunger. Candy screamed. She fought 
to reach her pistol, strapped to 
her right hip. More tentacles 
stopped her. She screamed and 
screamed again, throwing her 
body to shake off the grip, trying 
to kick with her feet. 

There was a movement in the 
road at the top of the rise. For a 
moment, elation surged in Candy, 
almost stifling her. Perhaps some 
expedition member had heard 
her, was hurrying to her rescue. 
Then she saw that the newcomers 
were'Quxas. Hope vanished, leaving her limp and hollow. To be 
killed by these horrors was bad 
enough, but to be killed in the 
presence of a group of piebald 
morons, who would stand and 
watch and moan, but not lift a 
hand . . . 

In her agitation, she did not 
notice that the Quxas were nine 
.in number and wore baseball 
caps. They drew short clubs, 



HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



135 



shaped like bats. 

"Kill the umpire!" they shouted, hatred born of diamond conflicts in their cry. "Kill the umpire!" they yelled and charged. 

*, 

TN military formation, they 
clubbed their way through 
their enemies, battering and 
smashing until Candy was free, 
with a dozen dying horals on the 
ground, their tentacles contract- ' 
ing and writhing. The Quxa 
leader made his bobbing bow to 
her. 1 

"How do," he said politely. 
"We dip them in calcimine vat, 
you bet. We hang them out like 
wash. Now we give team yell." " 

The Quxas put their arms 
around each other's shoulders. 
In unison, they chanted: 

"Hoe tomata; hoe potata 
Half past alligata, 
Bum, bum, bulligata, 
Chickala dah! 
Pussycats! Pussycats! 
Rah! Rah! Rah!" 

"Pussycats," the' leader explained to Candy, "are honored 
animal on planet where Billbrad 
is head cheese." 

"I'll bet you play baseball 
nicely," Candy said. 

Woe broke forth on nine broad 
faces. 

"Misfortunately not," confessed the captain^ "Thirty-three 




 



teams in Quxa town. Pussycats 
in thirty-third place." He brightened. "Go ivory hunt now. Catch 
nine new Quxas. Teach 'em baseball. Then maybe we beat 'em 
and not be in cellar any more." 

Together, the team bobbed politely to Candy and trotted down 
the road. 

Happily,. Candy went up the 
rise, then stopped in astonishment, looking at Quxa town. 

Gone was the straggling, haphazard settlement, with the flimsy 
huts and untended starvation 
patches where individual Quxas 
tried to raise their own food. Instead, building sites were laid 
out in straight, broad rows, and 
Quxas were working, three and 
four in a group, raising substantial homes of timber. Others were 
surrounding the settlement with 
a wall of brambles, impenetrable 
to horals. Teams of men, two to 
a thrag, were plowing, preparing 
large fields for tillage. And down 
the side of the settlement, affectionately tended, ran a line of 
baseball fields. 

Just off the road, a Quxa squatted, baseball cap on his head, 
watching a crude sun dial. 

"Nice day for game," he greeted Candy. 

OPEECHLESS with surprise, 
the girl made a dazed questioning gesture toward the improvements. 



"Billbrad do it," the Quxa informed her. "He tell us how. 
Work one by one, he say, work 
all time to fill belly, maybe fill 
horal belly instead. Work all by 
all, do more quick- Have time 
in afternoon. Batter up! Sock it, 
boy! Wing it home, he sliding!" 

The sun's shadow touched a 
peg
"Five minute!" bawled the 
Quxa. 

The laborers quit work, put 
away their tools. The farmers 
herded their thrags into a strongly constructed corral. The natives 
gathered in knots at the settlement edge and looked longingly 
at the baseball fields. 

"Yestday I fool Billbrad," confided the Quxa. "I hide ball, 
catch him off second. Billbrad get 
all red face and say — " 

"Never mind what Bill said," 
Candy interjected hastily. 

The shadow touched another 
peg
"Play ball!" the Quxa yelled. 
"Play ball! Play ball! Play ball!" 

He sprang up, produced a baseball glove and spat into it reverently. 

"I go play now. You come see. 
Get scorecard, know players." 

He looked at Candy hopefully. 

" 'Specially me," he added. 

Out of the moil of Quxas came 
the lank form of Bill Bradley. He 
spied the girl, whooped and came 
running to her. For a few mo


HALF PAST ALLIGATOR 



137 



merits they talked at once, in an 
incoherent and ecstatic jumble. 
Then Candy, catching control of 
herself, cited in admiration the 
change in the Quxa village. 

"And you've done all this!" she 
concluded. 

"I didn't do anything!" Bill 
protested. "They like to play 
baseball and this sort of happened. We're getting representative 
government into action now. Each 
team elects a captain and the 
captains are the town council. 
Tonight they're going to vote on 
naming the settlement Brooklyn." 

"You know," said Candy, "I'll 
bet they'll make you a culture 
god." 

rpHE tanned face of Bill Brad-™- ley took on the rose hue of a 
blush. 

"Well, Moahlo carved a statue 
and they've put it in front of 
league headquarters — that's their 
city hall," he admitted uncomfortably. "It doesn't look much 
like me. I've got six arms because 
they wanted me batting, pitching 
and catching a ball all at the 
same time." 

Candy slipped a hand into his. 

"Is there a place around here," 
she asked in a small tone, "where 
a culture god can take a girl and 
—well, talk to her?" 

"Is there!" said Bill. "You just 
come with me . . ." 

A heavy object bumped into 



him. He whirled at the touch. 

"Oh! Hi, Ratakka," Bill said 
in a flat voice. 

Montgomery's king had returned to his subjects. He was alone 
— his captives having escaped on 
the ride over — and he was in vile 
temper. Glaring evilly, he mo-tioned at the baseball players. 
He was recalling an advice of 
Montgomery: "Whatever your 
subjects like to do most, do it 
better than they can. In that 
way, you will get their respect 
and find it easier to take over." 

"What that fool doings-on?" 
snarled Ratakka. "Ratakka do, 
too." 

Bill's already sagging spirits 
sank again. With Ratakka's 
strength and reflexes, the great 
brute undoubtedly would become 
the star of stars, gathering admirers to himself and destroying 
all the pleasant prospects now so 
happily started. Still, it was Bill's 
duty to give him every chance . . . 

"I'll see what team has an 
opening, Ratakka. Perhaps you'd 
better bat seventh for a few days. 
Then you can move to the cleanup spot." 

The giant stopped him. '^Ratakka not ordinary Quxa; Ratakka a king. Ratakka not play like 
those serfs. Want special job." 

A wild thought struck Bill. On 
the playing fields were more than 
two hundred Quxas, most of them 
with a justified and carefully

nurtured dislike for the surly 
slab of muscle before him. In the 
old days, they could do nothing 
individually against him. 

But the Quxas had learned to 
fight as a team. If he could only 
give them the shadow of an excuse, trap Ratakka into rousing 
their joint anger, take advantage 
of the predjudices of their newfound love for baseball, then Ratakka would get the reckoning 
that he deserved, the days of his 
supremacy would be over, the 
threat of his tyranny would be 
removed from a happy race. 

"DILL grinned broadly. "Sure 
thing, old pal," he said. 

He took off his own baseball 
cap and put it' backward on Ratakka's head. He signaled for 
someone to bring over a mask 
and chest protector. 

"There's only one of these at 
each playing field," Bill explained. "In a way, he's boss of the 
game. Are you sure you want to 
do it? Sometimes the players 
argue with you." 

"Anyone argue with Ratakka," 
the giant said, raising a huge fist, 
"Ratakka knock 'em down. Ratakka a king, boss of game." 

"Okay, boy, you asked for it," 
Bill said. 

He thrust a whiskbroom into 
Ratakka's hand. 

"You can be umpire," said Bill 
Bradley.
