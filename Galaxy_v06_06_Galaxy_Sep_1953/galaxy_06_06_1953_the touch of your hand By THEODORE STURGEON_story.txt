the touch of your hand By THEODORE STURGEON 

"DIG there," said Osser, 
pointing. 

The black-browed 
man pulled back. "Why?" 

"We must dig deep to build 
high, and we are going to build 
high." 

"Why?" the man asked again. 
"To keep the enemy out." 
"There are no enemies." 
Osser laughed bitterly. "I'll 
have enemies." 
"Why?" 

Osser came to him. "Because 



I'm going to pick up this village 
and shake it until it wakes up. 
And if it won't wake up, I'll keep 
shaking until I break its back 
and it dies. Dig." 

"I don't see why," said the man 
doggedly. 

Osser looked at the golden 
backs of his hands, turned them 
over, watched them closing. He 
raised his eyes to the other. 

"This is why," he said. 

His right fist tore the man's 
cheek. His left turned the man's

breath to a bullet which exploded 
as it left him. He huddled on the 
ground, unable to exhale, inhaling in small, heavy, tearing sobs. 
His eyes opened and he looked 
up at Osser. He could not speak, 
but his eyes did; and through 
shock and pain all they said was 
"Why?" 

"TJOU want reasons," Osser 
said, when he felt the man 
could hear him. "You want reasons — all of you. You see both 
sides of every question and you 
weigh and balance and cancel 
yourselves out. I want an end to 
reason. I want things done." 

He bent to lift the bearded 
man to his feet. Osser stood half 
a head taller and his shoulders 
were as full and smooth as the 
bottoms of bowls. Golden hairs 
shifted and glinted on his forearms as he moved his fingers and 
the great cords tensed and valleyed. He lifted the man clear of 
the ground and set him easily on 
his feet and held htm until he 
was sure of his balance. 

"You don't understand me, do 
you?" 

The man shook his head weakly. 

"Don't try. You'll dig more if 
you don't try." He clapped the 
handle of the shovel into the 
man's hand and picked up a mattock. "Dig," he said, and the 
man began to dig. 



Osser smiled when the man 
turned to work, arched his nostrils and drew the warm clean 
air into his lungs. He liked the 
sunlight now, the morning smell 
of the turned soil, the work he 
had to do and the idea itself of 
working. 

Standing so, with his head 
raised, he saw a flash of bright 
yellow, the turn of a tanned face. 
Just a glimpse, and she was gone. 

For a moment he tensed, 
frowning. If she had seen him, 
she would be off to clatter the 
story of it to the whole village. 
Then he smiled. Let her. Let 
them all know. They must, sooner 
or later. Let them try to stop 
him. 

He laughed, gripped his mattock, and the sod flew. So Jubilith 
saw fit to watch him, did she? 

He laughed again. Work now, 
Juby later. In time he would 
have everything. 

Everything. 

npHE village street wound and 
■■- wandered and from time to 
time divided and rejoined itself, 
for each house was built on a 
man's whim — near, far, high, small, separate, turned to or 
away. What did not harmonize 
contrasted well, and over all it 
was a pleasing place to walk. 

Before a shop a wood-cobbler 
sat, gouging out sabots; and he 
was next door to the old leather

worker who cunningly wove immortal belts o/ square-knotted 
rawhide. Then a house, and another, and a cabin; a space of 
green where children played; and 
the skeleton of a new building 
where a man, his apron pockets 
full of hardwood pegs, worked 
knowledgably with a heavy mallet. 

The cobbler, 'the leatherworker, 
the children and the builder all 
stopped to watch Jubilith because she was beautiful and because she ran. When she was by, 
they each saw the others watching, and each smiled and waved 
and laughed a little, though nothing was said. 

A puppy lolloped along after 
her, three legs deft, the fourth in 
the way. Had it been frightened, 
it would not have run, and had 
Jubilith spoken to it, it would 
have followed wherever she went. 
But she ignored it, even when it 
barked its small soprano bark, 
so it curved away from her, pretending it had been going somewhere else anyway, and then it 
sat and puffed and looked after 
her sadly. 

Past the smithy with its shadowed, glowing heart she ran; past 
the gristmill with its wonderful 
wheel, taking and yielding with 
its heavy cupped hands. A boy 
struck his hoop and it rolled 
across her path. Without breaking stride, she leaped high over 



it and ran on, and the glassblower's lips burst away from his 
pipe, for a man can smile or 
blow glass, but not both at the 
same time. 

When at last she reached 
Wrenn's house, she was breathing deeply, but with no difficulty, 
in the way possible only to those 
who run beautifully. She stopped 
by the open door and waited politely, not looking in until Pyva 
came out and touched her shoulder. 

JUBILITH faced her, keeping 
her eyes closed for a long moment, for Oyva was not only 
very old, she was Wrenn's wife. 

"Is it Jubilith?" asked Oyva, 
smiling. 

"It is," said the girl. She opened 
her eyes. 

Oyva, seeing their taut corners, said shrewdly, "A troubled 
Jubilith as well. I'll not keep you. 
He's just inside." 

Juby found a swift flash of 
smile to give her and went into 
the house, leaving the old woman 
to wonder where, where in her 
long life she had seen such a brief 
flash of such great loveliness. A 
firebird's wing? A green meteor? 
She put it away in her mind next 
to the memory of a burst of 
laughter — Wrenn's, just after he 
had kissed her first — and sat 
down on a three-legged stool by 
the side of the house. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND

A HEAVY fiber screen had 
been set up inside the doorway, to form a sort of meander, 
and at the third turn it was very 
dark. Juby paused to let the sunlight drain away from her vision. 
Somewhere in the dark before her 
there was music, the hay-clean 
smell of flower petals dried and 
freshly rubbed, and a voice humming. The voice and the music 
were open and free, but choked a 
listener's throat like the sudden 
appearance of a field of daffodils. 

The voice and the music 
stopped short, and someone 
breathed quietly in the darkness. 

"Is ... is it Wrenn?" she 
faltered. 

"It is," said the voice. 

"Jubilith here." 

"Move the screen," said the 
voice. "I'd like the light, talking 
to you, Jubilith." 

She felt behind her, touched 
the screen. It had many hinges 
and swung easily away to the 
. doorside. Wrenn sat crosslegged 
in the corner behind a frame 
which held a glittering complex 
of stones. 

He brushed petal -dust from his 
hands. "Sit there, child, and tell 
me what it is you do not understand." 

She sat down befpre him and 
lowered her eyes, and his widened, as if someone had taken 
away a great light. 

When she had nothing to say, 



he prompted her gently: "See if 
you can put it all into a single 
word, Jubilith." 

She said immediately, "Osser." 

"Ah," said Wrenn. 

"I followed him this morning, 
out to the foothills beyond the 
Sky-tree Grove. He—" 

Wrenn waited. 

Jubilith put up her small 
hands, clenched, and talked in a 
rush. "Sussten, with the black 
brows, he was with Osser. They 
stopped and Osser shouted at 
him, and, when I came to where 
I could look down and see them, 
Osser took his fists and hammered 
Sussten, knocked him down. He 
laughed and picked him up. Sussten was sick; he was shaken and 
there was blood on his face. 
Osser told him to dig, and Sussten dug, Osser laughed again, he 
laughed ... I think he saw me. 
I came here." 

Slowly she put her fists down. 
Wrenn said nothing, 

Jubilith said, in a voice like a 
puzzled sigh, "I understand this: 
when a man hammers something, 
iron or clay or wood, it is to 
change what he hammers from 
what it is to what he wishes it 
to be." She raised one hand, 
made a fist, and put it down 
again. She shook her head slightly and her heavy soft hair moved 
on her back. "To hammer a man 
is to change nothing. Sussten remains Sussten."

"It was good to tell me of 
this," said Wrenn when he was 
sure she had finished. 

"Not good," Jubilith disclaimed. "I want to understand." 

WRENN shook his head. Juby 
cocked her head on one side 
like a wondering bright bird. 
When she realized that his gesture was a refusal, a small paired 
crease' came and went between 
her brows. 

"May I not understand this?" 
"You musr not understand it," 
Wrenn corrected. "Not yet, anyway. Perhaps after a time. Perhaps never." 

"Oh," she said. "I— I didn't 
know." 

"How could you know?" he 
asked kindly. "Don't follow Osser 
again, Jubilith." 

She parted her lips, then again 
gave the small headshake. She 
rose and went out.' 

Oyva came to her. "Better now, 
Jubilith?" 

Juby turned her head away; 
then, realizing that this was illmannered, met Oyva's gaze. The 
girl's eyes were full of tears. She 
closed them respectfully. Oyva 
touched her shoulder and let her 

g?
Watching the slim, bright figure trudge away, bowed with 
thought, drag-footed, unseeing, 
Oyva grunted and stumped into 
the house. 



"Did she have to be hurt?" she 
demanded. 

"She did," said Wrenn gently. 
"Osser," he added. 

"Ah," she said, in just the tone 
he had used when Jubilith first 
mentioned the name. "What has 
he done now?" 

Wrenn told her. Oyva sucked 
her lips in thoughtfully. "Why 
was the girl following him?" 

"I didn't ask her. But don't 
you know?" 

"I suppose I do," said Oyva, 
and sighed. "That mustn't happen, Wrenn." 

"It won't. I told her not to 
follow him again." 

She looked at him fondly. "I 
suppose even you can act like a 
fool once in a while." 

He was startled. "Fool?" 

"She loves him. You won't 
keep her from him by a word of 
advice." 

"You judge her by yourself," 
he said, just as fondly. "She's 
only a child. In a day, a week, 
she'll wrap someone else up in her 
dreams." 

"Suppose she doesn't?" 

"Don't even think about it." A 
shudder touched his voice. 

"I shall, though," said Oyva 
with determination. "And you'd 
do well to think about it, too." 
When his eyes grew troubled, she 
touched his cheek gently. "Now 
play some more for me." 

He sat down before the instru

ment, his hands poised. Then into 
the tiny bins his fingers went, 
rubbing this dried-petal powder 
and that, and the stone's glowed, 
changing the flower-scents into 
music and shifting colors. 

He began to sing softly to the 
music. 

rriHEY dug deep, day by day, 
and they built. Osser did the 
work of three men, and sometimes six or eight others worked 
with him, and sometimes one or 
two. Once he had twelve. But 
never did he work alone. 

When the stone was three tiers 
above ground level, Osser climbed 
the nearest rise and stood looking 
down at it proudly, at the thickness and strength of the growing 
walls, at the toiling workers who 
lifted and strained to make them 
grow. 

"Is it Osser?" 

The voice was as faint and shy 
as a fern uncurling, as promising 
as spring itself. 

He turned. 

"Jubilith;" she told him. 

"What are you doing here?" 

"I come here every day," she 
said. She indicated the copse 
which crowned the hill. "I hide 
here and watch you." 

"What do you want?" 

She laced her fingers. "I would 
like to dig there and lift stones." 

"No," he said, and turned to 
study the work again. 



"Why not?" 

"Never ask me why. 'Because 
I say so' — that's all the answer 
you'll get from me — you or anyone." 

She came to stand beside him. 
"You build fast." 

He nodded. "Faster than any 
village house was ever built." He 
could sense the 'why' rising within her, and could feel it being 
checked. « 

"I want to build it, too," she 
pleaded. 

"No," he said. His eyes widened as he watched the work. 
Suddenly he was gone, leaping 
down the slope in great springy 
strides. He turned the corner of 
the new wall and stood, saying 
nothing. The man who had been 
idling turned quickly and lifted a 
stone. Osser smiled a quick, taut 
smile and went to work beside 
him. Jubilith stood on the slope, 
watching, wondering. 

She came almost every day as 
the tower grew. Osser never spoke 
to her. She watched the sunlight 
on him, the lithe strength, the 
rippling gold. He stood like a 
great tree, squatted like a rock, 
moved like a thundercloud. His 
voice was a whip, a bugle, the 
roar of a bull. 

She saw him less and less in 
the village. Once it was a fearsome thing to see. Early in the 
morning he appeared suddenly, 
overtook a man? lifted him and 



10 




 



threw him flat on the ground. 

"I told you to be out theife 
yesterday," he growled, and 
strode away. 

Friends came and picked the 
man up, held him softly while 
he coughed, took him away to be 
healed. 

No one went to Wrenn about 
it; the word had gone around 
that Osser and his affairs were 
not to be understood. Most things 
could be understood by anyone. 
Wrenn's function was to explain 
those few things which could not 
be understood. But certain of 
these few were not to be understood at all. So Osser was left 
alone to do as he wished — which 
was a liberty, after all, that was 
enjoyed by everyone else. 

HpWILIGHT came when Jubi■■- lith waited past her usual 
time. She waited until by ones 
and twos the workers left the 
tower, until Osser himself had 
climbed the hill, until he had 
paused to look back and be proud 
and think of tomorrow's work, 
until he, too, had turned his face 
to the town. Then she slipped 
down to the tower and around it, 
and carefully climbed the scaffolding on the far side. She looked ' 
about her. 

The tower was now four stories 
high and seemed to be shaping 
toward a roof. Circular in crosssection, the tower had two rooms 



on each floor, an east-west wall 
between them on the ground floor, 
a north-south wall on the next, 
and so on up. 

, There was a central well into 
which was built a spiral staircase 
— a double spiral, as if one helix 
had been screwed into the other. 
This made possible two exits to 
stairs on each floor at the same 
level, though they were walled 
off one from the other. Each of 
the two rooms on every floor had 
one connecting doorway. -Each 
room had three windows in it, 
wide on the inside, tapering 
through the thick stone wall to 
form the barest slit outside. 

A portion of the castellated 
roof was already built. It overhung the entrance, and had slots 
in the overhang through which 
the whole entrance face of the 
tower could be covered by one 
man lying unseen on the roof, 
looking straight down. 

Stones lay in a trough ready 
for placing, and there was some 
leftover mortar in the box. Jubilith picked up a trowel and 
worked it experimentally in the 
stuff, then lifted some out and 
tipped it down on the unfinished 
top of the wall, just as she had 
seen Osser do so many times. She 
put down the trowel and chose a 
stone. It was heavy — much heavier than she had expected — but 
she made it move, made it lift, 
made it seat itself to suit her on 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



11 



the fresh mortar. She ticked off 
the excess from the join and 
stepped back to admire it in the 
fading light. 

Two great clamps, hard as 
teeth, strong as a hurricane, 
caught her right thigh and her 
left armpit. She was swung into 
the air and held helpless over the 
unfinished parapet. 

She was utterly silent, shocked 
past the ability even to gasp. 

"I told you you were not to 
work here," said Osser between 
his teeth. So tall he was, so long 
were his arms as he held her 
high over his head, that it seemed 
almost as far to the parapet as it 
was to the ground below. 

He leaned close to the edge and ^ 
* shook her. "I'll throw you off. 
This tower is mine to build, you 
hear?" 

If she had been able to breathe, 
she might have screamed or 
pleaded with him. If she had 
screamed or pleaded, he might 
have dropped her. But her silence 
apparently surprised him. He 
grunted and set her roughly on 
her feet. She caught at his shoulder to keep her balance, then 
quickly transferred her hold to 
the edge of the parapet. She 
dropped her head between her 
upper arms. Her long soft hair 
fell forward over her face, and 
she moaned. 

"I told you," he said, really 
seeing her at last. His voice shook. 



He stepped toward her and put 
out his hand. She screamed. "Be 
quiet !" he roared. A moan shut 
off in mid-breath. "Ah, I told 
you, Juby. You shouldn't have 
tried to build here." 

He ran his great hands over the 
edge of the stonework, found the 
one she had laid, the one that had 
cost her such effort to lift. With 
one hand, he plucked it up and 
threw it far out into the shadows 
below. * 

"I wanted to help you with it," 
she whispered. 

"Don't you understand?" he 
cried. "No one builds here who 
wants to help!" 

SHE simply shook her head. 
She tried to breathe deeply 
and a long shudder possessed her. 
When it passed, she turned weakly and stood, her back partly 
arched over the edge of the parapet, her hands behind her to 
cushion the stone. She shook the 
hair out of her face; it fell away 
on either side like a dawnlit bowwave. She looked up at him with 
an expression of such piteous confusion that .his dwindling rage 
vanished altogether. 

He dropped his eyes and 
shuffled one foot like a guilty 
child. "Juby, leave me alone." 

Something almost like a smile 
touched her lips. She brushed her 
bruised arm, then walked past 
him to the place where the scaf

folding projected above the paraI*t. 

"Not that way," he called. 
"Come here." 

He took her hand and led her 
to the spiral staircase at the 
center of the tower. It was almost 
totally dark inside. It seemed like 
an age to her as they descended; 
she was alone in a black universe consisting of a rhythmic 
drop and turn, and a warm hard 
hand in hers, holding and leading 
her. 

When they emerged, he stopped 
in the strange twilight, a darkness for all the world but a dazzle 
to them, so soaked with blackness 
were their eyes. She tugged gently, but he would not release her 
hand. She moved close to see his 
face. His eyes were wide and 
turned unseeing to the far slopes; 
he was frowning, yet his mouth 
was not fierce, but irresolute. 
Whatever his inward struggle 
was, it left his face gradually 
and transferred itself to his hand. 
Its pressure on hers became firm, 
hard, intense, painful. 

"Osser!" 

He dropped the hand and 
stepped back, shamed. "Juby, I 
will take you to . . . Juby, do you 
want to understand?" He waved 
at the tower. 

She said, "Oh, yes!" 

He looked at her closely, and 
the angry, troubled diffidence 
came and went. "Half a day 



there, half a day back again," he 
said. 

She recognized that this was as 
near as this feral, unhappy man 
could come to asking a permission. "I'd like to understand," 
she said. 

"If you don't, I'm going to 
kill you," he blurted. He turned 
to the west and strode off, not 
looking back. 

Jubilith watched him go, and 
suddenly there was a sparkle in 
her wide eyes. She slipped out of 
her sandals, caught them up in 
her hand, and ran lightly and 
silently after him. He planted hisfeet strongly, like the sure, powerful teeth of the millwheel gears, 
and he would not look back. She 
sensed how immensely important 
it was to him not to look back*. 
She knew that right-handed men 
look back ove.r their left shoulders, so she drifted along close to 
him, a little behind him, a little to 
his right. How long, how long, 
until he looked to see if she was 
coming? 

UP and up the slope, to its 
crest, over . . . down ... ah! 
Just here, just at the last second 
where he could turn and look 
without stopping and still catch 
a glimpse of the tower's base, 
where they had stood. So he 
turned, and she passed around 
him like a windblown feather, 
unseen. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



13 



And he stopped, looking back, 
craning. His shoulders slumped, 
and slowly he turned to his path 
again — and there was Jubilith before him. 
She laughed. 

His jaw dropped, and then his 
lips came together in a thin, 
angry seal. For a moment he 
stared at her; and suddenly, 
quite against his will, there burst 
from him a single harsh bark of 
laughter. She put out her hand 
and he came to her, took it, and 
they went their way together. 

They came to a village when 
it was very late and very dark, 
and Osser circled it. They came 
to another, and Jubilith thought 
he would do the same, for he 
turned south; but when they 




14 



GALAXY SCIfNCE FICTION 



came abreast of it, he struck 
north again. 

"We'll be seen," he explained 
gruffly, "but we'll be seen coming from the south and leaving 
northward." 

She would not ask where he 
was taking her, or why he was 
making these elaborate arrangements, but already she had an 
idea. What lay to the west was — 
not forbidden, exactly, but, say 
discouraged. It was felt that there 
was nothing in that country that 
could be of value. Anyone traveling that way would surely be remembered. 

So through the village they 
went, and they dined quickly at 
an inn, and went northward, and 
once in the darkness, veered west 



again. In a wood so dark that she 
had taken his hand again, he 
stopped and built a fire. He threw 
down springy boughs and a thick 
heap of ferns, and this was her 
bed. He slept sitting up, his back 
to a tree trunk, with Jubilith between him and the fire. 

Jubilith awoke twice during 
the long night, once to see him 
with his eyes closed, but feeling 
that he was not asleep; and once 
to see him with his eyes open and 
the dying flames flickering in the 
pupils, and she thought then that 
he was asleep, or at least not 
with her, but lost in the pictures 
the flames painted. 

In the morning they moved on, 
gathering berries for breakfast, 
washing in a humorous brook.

THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



15 



And during this whole journey, 
nothing passed between them but 
the small necessary phrases: 
"You go first here." "Look out — 
it drops." "Tired yet?" 

For there was that about Jubilith which made explanations unnecessary. Though she did not 
know where they were going, or 
why, she understood what must 
be done to get them there within 
the framework of his desire: to 
go immediately, as quickly as 
possible, undetected by anyone 
else. 

She did only what she could 
to help and did not plague him 
with questions which would certainly be answered in good time. 
So: "Here are berries." "Look, a 
red bird!" "Can we get through 
there, or shall we go around?" 
And nothing more. 

rpHEY did well, the weather 
was fine, and by mid-morning 
they had reached the tumbled 
country of the Crooked Hills. 
Jubilith had seen them from afar 
— great broken mounds and 
masses against the western sky — 
but no one ever went there, and 
she knew nothing about them. 

They were in open land now, 
and Jubilith regretted leaving the 
color and aliveness of the forest. 
The grasses here were strange, 
like yet unlike those near her 
village. They were taller, sickly, 
and some had odd ugly flowers. 



There were bald places, scored 
with ancient rain-gullies, as if 
some mighty hand had dashed 
acid against the soil. There were 
few insects and no animals that 
she could see, and no birds sang. 
It was a place of great sadness 
rather than terror; there was 
little to fear, but much to grieve 
for. 

By noon, they faced a huge 
curved ridge, covered with broken stones. It looked as if the 
land itself had reared up and 
pressed back from a hidden something on the other side — something which it would not touch. 
Osser quickened their pace as 
they began to climb, although 
the going was hard. Jubilith realized that they were near the 
end of their journey, and uncomplainingly struggled along at 
the cruel pace he set. 

At the top, they paused, giving 
their first attention to their wind, 
and gradually to the scene before 
them. 

The ridge on which they stood 
was nearly circular, and perhaps 
a mile and a half in diameter. 
In its center was a small round 
lake with unnaturally bare shores. 
Mounds of rubble sloped down 
toward it on all sides, and farther 
back was broken stone. 

But it was the next zone which 
caught and held the eye. The 
weed-grown wreckage there was 
beyond description. Great twisted

' bi and ribs of gleaming metal 
>ve in and out of the slumped 
nps of soil and masonry. 
- nrby, a half-acre of laminated 
■if' stood on edge like a dinnerit ( in a clay bank. What could 
• ve been a building taller than 
M i y Jubilith had ever heard about 
i i y on its side, smashed and bulguig. 

Gradually she began to realize the peculiarity of this place — 
All the larger wreckage lay in 
lmes directly to and from the 
lake in a monstrous radiation of 
ruin. 

"What is this place?" she asked 
at last. 

"Don't know," he grunted, and 
went over the edge to skip down 
the steep slope. When she caught 
up with him near the bottom, he 
said, "There's miles of this, west 
and north of here, much bigger. 
But this is the one we came to 
see. Come." 

He looked to right and left as 
if to get his bearings, then 
plunged into the tough and 
scrubby underbrush that vainly 
tried to cover those tortured 
metal bones. She followed as 
closely as she could, beating at 
the branches which he carelessly 
let whip back. 

Just in front of her, he turned 
the corner of a sharp block of 
stone, and when she turned it no 
more than a second later, he was 
gone. 



SHE stopped, turned, turned 
again. Dust, weeds, lonely and 
sorrowful ruins. No Osser. She 
shrank back against the stone, 
her eyes wide. 

The bushes nearby trembled, 
then lashed. Osser's head emerged. "What's the matter? Come 
on!" he said gruffly. 

She checked an impulse to cry 
out and run to him, and came 
silently forward. Osser held the 
bushes briefly, and beside him she 
saw a black hole with broken 
steps leading downward. 

She hesitated, but he moved 
his head impatiently, and she 
passed him and led the way 
downward. When he followed, his 
wide flat body blocked out the 
light. The darkness was so heavy; 
her eyes ached. 

He prodded her in the small of 
the back. "Go on, go on!" 

The foot of the steps came 
sooner than she expected and her 
knees buckled as she took the 
downward step that was not 
there. She tripped, almost fell, 
then somehow got to the side 
wall and braced herself there, 
trembling. 

"Wait," he said, and the irrepressible smile quirked the corners of her mouth. As if she would 
go anywhere! . 

She heard him fumbling about 
somewhere, and then there was 
a sudden aching blaze of light 
that made her cry out and clap 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



17 



her hands over her face. 

"Look," he said. "I want you 
to look at this. Hold it." 

Into her hands he pressed a 
cylinder about half the length of 
her forearm. At one end was a 
lens from which the blue-white 
light was streaming. 

"See this little thing here," he 
said, and touched a stud at the 
side of the cylinder. The light 
disappeared, came on again. 

She laughed delightedly, took 
the cylinder and played its light 
around, switching it on and off, 
"It's wonderful!" she cried. "Oh, 
wonderful!" 

"You take this one," he said, 
pleased. He handed her another 
torch and took the first from 
her. "It isn't as good, but it will 
help. I'll go first." 

She took the second torch and 
tried it. It worked the same way, 
but the light was orange and 
feeble. Osser strode ahead down 
a slanting passageway. At first 
there was a great deal of rubble 
underfoot, but soon the way was 
clear as they went farther and 
deeper. Osser walked with confidence, and she knew he had 
been here before, probably many 
times. 

"Here," he said, stopping to 
wait for her. His voice echoed 
strangely, vibrant with controlled 
excitement. 

He turned his torch ahead, 
swept it back and forth. 



They were at the entrance to 
a room. It was three times the 
height of a man, and as big as 
their village green. She stared 
around, awed. 

"Come," Osser said again, and 
went to the far corner. 

A massive, boxlike object stood 
there. One panel, about eye-level, 
was of a milky smooth substance, 
the rest of black metal. Projecting from the floor in front of it 
was a lever. Osser grasped it 
confidently and pulled. It yielded 
sluggishly, and returned to its 
original position. Osser tugged 
again. There was a low growling 
sound from the box. Osser pulled, 
released, pulled, released, each 
time a little faster. The sound 
rose in pitch, higher and higher. 

"Turn off your light," he said. 

She did so and blackness snapped in around them. As the dazzle faded from her eyes, she 
detected a flicker of silver light 
before her, and realized that it 
came from the milky pane in the 
box. As Osser pulled at the lever 
and the whine rose and rose in 
pitch, the square got bright 
enough for her to see her hands 
when she looked down at them. 

And then — the pictures. 

JUBILITH had never seen pictures like these. They moved, 
for one thing; for another, they 
had no color. Everything in them 
was black and white and shades 



18 




 



"( gray. Yet everything they 
howed seemed very real. 

Not at first, for there was flickTing and stopped motion, and 
' i'-n slow motion as Osser's lever 
moved faster and faster. But at 
i st the picture steadied, and 

•ser kept the lever going at the 
me speed, flicking it with apparent ease about twice a second, 

■ Uile the whine inside the box 
;t ttled to a steady, soft moan. 

The picture showed a ball spinning against a black, light-flecked 

■ urtain. It rushed close until it 
tilled the screen, and still closer, 
and Jubilith suddenly had the 
feeling that she was falling at 
tremendous velocity from an unthinkable height. Down and down 
the scene went, until at last the 
surface began to take on the 
qualities of a bird's-eye view. 
She saw a river and lakes, and a 
great range of hills — 

And, at last, the city. 

It was a city beyond fantasy, 
greater and more elaborate than 
imagination could cope with. Its 
towers stretched skyward to 
pierce the clouds themselves — 
some actually did. It had wide 
ramps on which traffic crawled, 
great bridges across the river, 
parks over which the buildings 
hung like mighty cliffs. Closer 
still the silver eye came to the 
scene, and she realized that the 
traffic was not crawling, but moving faster than a bird, faster than 



the wind. The vehicles were low 
and sleek and emcient.
And on the walks were people, 
and the scene wheeled and slowed and showed them. They were 
elaborately clothed and well-fed; 
they were hurried and orderly at 
the same time. There was a square 
in which perhaps a thousand of 
them, all dressed alike, were 
drawn up in lines as straight as 
stretched string. Even as she 
watched, they all began to move 
together, a thousand left legs 
coming forward, a thousand right 
arms swinging back. 

Higher, then, and more, of the 
city — more and more of it, until' 
the sense of wonder filled her 
lungs and she hardly breathed; 
and still more of it, miles of it. 
And at last a great open space 
with what looked like sections of 
road crossing on it — but such 
unthinkable roads! Each was as 
wide as her whole village and 
miles long. And on these roads, 
great birdlike machines tilted 
down and touched and rolled, 
and swung and ran and took the 
air, dozens of them every minute. 
The scene swept close again, and 
it was as if she were in such a 
machine herself; but it did not 
land. It raced past the huge busy 
crossroads and out to a coastline. 

And there were ships, ships as 
long as the tallest buildings were 
high, and clusters, dozens, hundreds of other vessels working 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



19 



and smoking and milling about 
in the gray water. Huge machines 
crouched over ships and lifted 
out cargoes; small, agile machines 
scurried about the docks and 
warehouses. 

Then at last the scene dwindled 
as the magic eye rose higher and 
higher, faster and faster. Details 
disappeared, and clouds raced 
past and downward, and at last 
the scene was a disc and then a 
ball floating in starlit space. 

|~|SSER let the lever go and it 
snapped back to its original 
position. The moan descended 
quickly in pitch, and the motion 
on the screen slowed, flickered, 
faded and went out. 

Jubilith let the darkness come. 
Her mind spun and shook with 
the impact of what she had seen. 
Slowly she recovered herself. She 
became conscious of Osser's hard 
breathing. She turned on her dim 
orange torch and looked at him. 
He was watching her. 

"What was it?" she breathed. 

"What I came to show you." 

She thought hard. She thought 
about his tower, about his refusal 
to let her work on it, about his 
cruelty to those who had. She 
looked at him, at the blank 
screen. And this was to supply 
the reason. 

She shook her head. 

He lowered himself slowly and 
squatted like an animal, hunched 



up tight, his knees in his armpits. 
This lifted and crooked his heavy 
arms. He rested their knuckles on 
the floor. He glowered at her and 
said nothing. He was waiting. 

On the way here, he had said, 
"I'll kill you if you don't understand." But he wouldn't really, 
would he? Would he? 

If he had towered over her, 
ranted and shouted, she would 
not have been afraid. But squatting there, waiting, silent, with 
his great arms bowed out like 
that, he was like some patient, 
preying beast. 

She .turned off the light to blot 
out the sight of him, and immediately became speechless with 
terror at the idea of his sitting 
there in the dark so close, waiting. She might run; she was so 
swift . . . but no; crouched like 
that, he could spring and catch 
her before she could tense a 
muscle. 

Again she looked at the dead 
screen. "Will you . . . tell me 
something?" she quavered. 

"I might." 

"Tell me, then: When you first 
saw that picture, did you understand? The very first time?" 

His expression did not change. 
But slowly he relaxed. He rocked 
sidewise, sat down, extended his 
legs. He was man again, not monster. She shuddered, then controlled it. 

He said, "It took me a long 



20 




 



' i me and many visits. I should 
not have asked you to understand 
lit once." 

She again accepted the timid 
half -step toward an apology, and 
was grateful. 

He said, "Those were men and 
women just like us. Did you see 
that? Just like us." 

"Their clothes — " 

"Just like us," he insisted. "Of 
course they dressed differently, 
lived differently! In a world like 
that, why not? Ah, how they 
built, how they built!" 

"Yes," she whispered. Those 
towers, the shining, swift vehicles, 
the thousand who moved like 
one . . . "Who were they?" she 
asked him. 

"Don't you know? Think — 
think!" 

"Osser, I want to understand. 
I truly want to!" 

OHE hunted frantically for the 
*^ right thing to say, the right 
way to catch at this elusive thing 
which was so frighteningly important to him. All her life she 
had had the answers to the questions she wanted to understand. 
All she had ever had to do was to 
close her eyes and think of the 
problem, and the answers soon 
came. 

But not this problem. 

"Osser," she pleaded, "where 
is it, the city, the great complicated city?" 



"Say, 'Where was it?'" he 
growled. 

She caught his thought and 
gasped. "This?' These ruins, Osser?" 

"Ah," he said approvingly. "It 
comes slowly, doesn't it? No, 
Juby. Not here. What was here 
was an outpost, a village, compared with the big city. North 
and west, I told you, didn't I? 
Miles of it. So big that ... so 
big — " He extended his arms, 
dropped them helplessly. Suddenly he leaned close to her, began to talk fast, feverishly. "Juby, 
that city — that world — was built 
by people. Why did they build 
and why do we not? What is the 
difference between those people 
and ours?" 

"They must have had . . ." 

"They had nothing we don't 
have. They're the same kind of 
people; they used something we 
haven't been using. Juby, I've got 
that something. I can build. I can 
make others build." 

A mental picture of the tower 
glimmered before her. "You built 
it with hate," she said wonderingly. "Is that what they had — 
cruelty, brutality, hatred?" 

"Yes!" 

"I don't believe it! I don't believe anyone could live with that 
much hate!" 

"Perhaps not. Perhaps they 
didn't. But they built with it. 
They built because, some men 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



21 



could flog others into building for 
them, building higher and faster 
than all the good neighbors 
would ever do helping one another." 

"They'd hate the man who 
made them build like that." 

Osser's hands crackled as he 
pressed them together. He laughed, and the echoes took everything that was unpleasant about 
that laughter and filled the far 
reaches of the dark room with it. 

"They'd hate him," he agreed. 
"But he's strong, you see. He 
was strong in the first place, to 
make them build, and he's stronger afterward with what they built 
for him. Do you know the only 
way they can express their hatred, 
once they find he's too strong for 
them?" 

Jubilith shook her head. 

"They'd build," he chuckled. 
"They'd build higher and faster 
than he did. They would find the 
strongest man among them and 
ask him to flog them into it. 
That's the way a great city goes 
up. A strong man builds, and 
strong men follow, and soon the 
man who's strongest of all makes 
all the other strong ones do his 
work. Do you see?" 

"And the . . . the others, the 
weak?" 

"What of them?" he asked 
scornfully. "There are more of 
them than strong ones — so there 
are more hands to do the strong 



man's work. And why shouldn't 
they? Don't they get the city to 
live in when it's built? Don't they 
ride about in swift shining carriers and fly through the air in 
the bird machines?" 

"Would they be—happy?" she 
asked. 

HE looked at her in genuine 
puzzlement. "Happy?" He 
smashed a heavy fist into his 
palm. "They'd have a city!" 
Again the words tumbled from 
him. "How do you live, you and 
the rest of the village? What do 
you do when you want a — well, 
a garden, food from the ground?" 

"I dig up the soil," she said. 
"I plant and water and weed." 
"Suppose you want a plow?" 
"I make one. Or I do work for 
someone who has one." 

"Uh," he grunted. "And there 
you are, hundreds of you in the 
village, each one planting a little, 
smithing a little, thatching and 
cutting and building a little. Everyone does everything except for 
how many — four, five? — the 
leather-worker, old Griak who 
makes wooden pegs for housebeams, one or two others." 

"They like to do just one work. 
But anyone can do any of the 
work. Those few, we take care 
of. Someone has to keep the 
skills alive." 

He snorted. "Put a strong man 
in the village and give him strong 



22 




 



1 1, <n to do what he wants. Get 

i villagers at once and make 
m all plant at once. You'll 
- food then for fifty, not ten!" 
Mut it would go to waste!" 

"It would not, because it would 
all belong to the head man. He 
• >uld give it away as he saw fit 

i lot to those who obeyed him, 

thing to those who didn't. 

1 1 at was left over he could keep 

i himself, and barter it out to 
i. cp building. Soon he would 
have the biggest house and the 
lirst animals and the finest women, and the more he got, the 

longer he would be. And a city 
would grow — a city! And the 
■ trong man would give everyone 
l utter things if they worked hard, 
and protect them." 

"Protect them? Against what?" 

"Against the other strong ones. 
There would be others." 

"And you — " 

"I shall be the strongest of 
all," he said proudly. He waved 
at the box. "We were a great people once. We're ants now — less 
than ants, for at least the ants 
work together for a common purpose. I'll make us great again.'-' 
His head sank onto his hand and 
he looked somberly into the 
shadows. "Something happened 
to this world. Something smashed 
the cities and the people and 
drove them down to what they 
are today. Something was broken 
within them, and they no longer 



dared to be great. Well, they will 
be. J have the extra something 
that was smashed out of them." 

"What smashed them, Osser?" 

"Who can know? I don't. I 
don't care, either." He tapped her 
with a long forefinger to emphasize. "All I care about is this: 
They were smashed because 
they were not strong enough. I 
shall be so strong I can't be 
smashed." 

She said, "A stomach can hold 
only so much. A man asleep 
takes just so much space. So 
much and no more clothing 
makes one comfortable. Why do 
you want more than these things, 
Osser?" 

She knew he was annoyed, and 
knew, too, that he was considering the question as honestly as 
he could. 

"It's because I ... I want to 
be strong," he said in a strained 
voice. 

"You are strong." 

"Who knows that?" he raged, 
and the echoes giggled and whispered. 

"I do. Wrenn. Sussten. The 
whole village." 

"The whole world will know. 
They will all do things for me." 

She thought, But everyone does 
everything for himself, all over 
the wo{ld. Except, she added, 
those who aren't able . . . 

With that in mind, she looked 
at him, his oaken shoulders, his 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR. HAND 



23 



powerful, bitter mouth. She 
touched the bruises his hands had 
left, and the beginnings of the 
understanding she had been groping for left her completely. 

She said dully, "Your tower 
. . . you'd better get back there." 

"Work goes on," he said, smiling tightly, "whether I'm there 
or not, as long as they don't know 
my plans. They are afraid. But — 
yes, we can go now." 

RISING, he flicked the stud of 
his torch. It flared bluewhite, faded to the weak orange 
of Jubilith's, then died. 
"The light . . ." 

"It's all right," said Jubilith. 
"I have mine." 

"When they get like that, so 
dim, you can't tell when they'll 
go out. Come — hurry! This place' 
is full of corridors; without light, 
we could be lost here for days.'" 

She glanced around at the 
crowding shadows. "Make it 
work again," she suggested. 

He looked at the dead torch 
in his hand. "You," he said 
flatly. He tossed it. She caught it 
in her free hand, put her torch 
on the floor, and held the broken 
one down so she could see it in 
the waning orange glow. She 
turned it over twice, her sensitive hands feeling with every part 
rather than with fingertips alone. 
She held it still and closed her 
eyes; and then it came to her, 



and she grasped one end with her 
right hand and the other with her 
left, and twisted. 

There was a faint click and the 
outer shell of the torch separated. 
She drew off the butt end of it; 
it was just a hollow shell. The 
entire mechanism was attached 
to the lens end and was now exposed. 

She turned it over carefully, 
keeping her fingers away from 
the workings. Again she closed 
her eyes and thought, and at last 
she bent close and peered. She 
nodded, fumbled in her hair, and 
detached a copper clasp. She 
bent and broke off a narrow strip 
of it and inserted it carefully 
into the light mechanism. Very 
carefully, she pried apart two 
small strands of wire, dipped a 
little deeper, hooked onto a tiny 
white sphere, and drew it out. 

"Poor thing," she murmured 
under her breath. 

"Poor what?" 

"Spider's egg," she said ruefully. "They fight so to save 
them; and this one will never 
hatch out now. It's been burned." 

She picked up the butt-end 
housing, slipped the two parts 
together, and twisted them until 
they clicked. She handed the 
torch to Osser. 

"You've wasted time," he complained, surly. 

"No, I haven't," she said. 
"We'll have light now." 



24 




 



He touched the stud on the 
torch. The brilliant, comforting, 
white light poured from it. 

"Yes," he admitted quietly. 

Watching his face as he handled the torch, she knew that if 
the could read what was in his 
mind in that second, she would 
have the answer to everything 
about him. She could not, however, and he said nothing, but 
led across the room to the dark 
corridor. 

He was silent all the way back 
to the broken steps. 

They stood halfway up, letting 
their eyes adjust to the daylight 
which poured down on them, and 
he said, "You didn't even try the 
torch to see if it would work, 
after you took out that egg." 

"I knew it Would work." She 
looked at him, amazed. "You're 
angry." 

"Yes," he said. 

He took her torch and his and 
put them away in a niche in the 
ruined stair -well, and they climbed up into the noon light. It was 
all but intolerable, as the two 
suns were all but in syzygy, the 
blue-white midget shining 
through the gfeat pale gaseous 
mass of the giant, so that together they cast only a single shadow. 

"It will be hot this afternoon," 
she said, but he was silent, steeped in some bitterness of his own, 
so she followed him quietly without attempting conversation. 



OLD Oyva stirred sleepily in 
her basking chair, and suddenly sat upright. 

Jubilith approached her, pale 
and straight. "Is it Oyva?" 

"It is, Jubilith," said the old 
woman. "I knew you would be 
back, my dear. I'm sore in my 
heart with you." v 
"Is he here?" 

"He is. He has been on a journey. You'll find him tired." 

"He should have been here, 
with all that has happened," 
said Jubilith. 

"He should have done exactly 
as he has done," Oyva stated 
bluntly. 

Jubilith recognized the enormity of her rudeness, and the 
taste of it was bad in her mouth. 
One did not criticize Wrenn's 
comings and goings. 

She faced Oyva and closed her 
eyes humbly.' 

Oyva touched her. "It's all 
right, child. You are distressed. 
Wrenn!" she called. "She is 
here!" 

"Come, Jubilith," Wrenn's 
voice called from the house. 

"He knows? No one knew I 
was coming here!" 

"He knows," said Oyva. "Go to 
him, child." 

Jubilith entered the house. 
Wrenn sat in his corner. The 
musical instrument was nowhere 
in sight. Aside from his cushions, 
there was nothing in the room. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



25 



Wrenn gave her his wise, sweet 
smile. "Jubilith," he said. "Come 
close." He looked drawn and 
pale, but quite untroubled. He 
put a cushion by him and she 
crossed slowly and sank down 
on it. 

He was quiet, and when she 
was sure it was because he waited for her to speak, she said, 
"Some things may not be understood." 

"True," he agreed. 

She kneaded her hands. "Is 
there never a change?" 

"Always," he said, "when it's 
time." " 

"Osser— " 

"Everyone will understand Osser very soon now." 

She screwed up her courage. 
"Soon is not soon enough. I must 
know him now." 

"Before anyone else?" he inquired mildly. 

"Let everyone know now," she 
suggested. 

He shook his head and there 
was no appeal in it. 

"Then let me. I shall be a part 
of you and speak of it only to 
you.'* 

"Why must you understand?" 

SHE shuddered. It was not cold, 
or fear, but simply the surgings of a great emotion. 

"I love him," she said. "And to 
love is to guard and protect. He 
needs me." 



"Go to him then." But she sat 
where she was, her long eyes cast 
down, weeping. Wrenn said, 
"There is more, then?" 

"I love . . ." She threw out an 
arm in a gesture which enfolded 
Wrenn, the house, the village. "I 
love the people, too, the gardens, 
the little houses; the way we go 
and come, and sing, and make 
music, and make our own tools 
and clothes. To love is to guard 
and protect . . . and I love these 
things, and I love Osser. I can 
destroy Osser, because he would 
not expect it of me; and, if I did, 
I would protect all of you. But 
if I protect him, he will destroy 
you. There is no answer to such 
a problem, Wrenn; it is a road," 
she cried, "with a precipice at 
each end, and no standing still!" 

"And understanding him would 
be an answer?" 

"There's no other!" She turned 
her face up to him, imploring. 
"Osser is strong, Wrenn, with a 
— a new thing about him, a thing 
none of the rest of us have. He 
has told me of it. It is a thing 
that can change us, make us part 
of him. He will build cities with 
our hands, on our broken bodies 
if we resist him. He wants us to 
be a great people again — he says 
we were, once, and have lost it 
all." 

"And do you regard that as 
greatness, Jubilith — the towers, 
the bird-machines?" 



26 




 



"How did you know of them? 
. . . Greatness? I don't know, I 
don't know," she said, and wept. 
"I love him, and he wants to 
build a city with a wanting greater than anything I have ever 
known or heard of before. Could 
he do it, Wrenn? Could he?" 

"He might," said Wrenn calmly. 

"He is in the village now. He 
has about him the ones who built 
his tower for him. They cringe 
around him, hating to be near 
and afraid to leave. He sent them 
one by one to tell all the people 
to come out to the foothills tomorrow, to begin work on his 
city. He wants enough building 
done in one hundred days to 
shelter everyone, because then, 
he says, he is going to burn this 
village to the ground. Why, 
Wrenn — why?" 

"Perhaps," said Wrenn, "so 
that we may all face his strength 
and yield to it. A man who could 
move a whole village in a hundred days just to show his 
strength would be a strong man 
indeed." 

"What shall we do?" 

"I think we shall go out to the 
foothills in the morning and begin to build." 

She rose and went to the door. 

"I know what to do now," she 
whispered. "I won't try to understand any more. I shall just go 
and help him." 



"Yes, go," said Wrenn, "He will 
need you." 

JUBILITH stood with Osser on 
the parapet, and with him 
stared into the dappled dawn. 
The whole sky flamed with the 
loom of the red sun's light, but 
the white one preceded it up the 
sky, laying sharp shadows in the 
soft blunt ones. Birds called 
and chattered in the Sky-tree 
Grove, and deep in the thickets 
the seven-foot bats grunted .as 
they settled in to sleep. 

"Suppose they don't come?" 
she asked. 

"They'll come," he said grimly. 
"Jubilith, why are you here?" 

She said, "I don't know what 
you are doing, Osser. I don't 
know whether it's right or whether you will keep on succeeding. I 
do know there will be pain and 
difficulty and I — I came to keep 
you safe, if I could ... I love 
you." 

He looked down at her, as 
thick and dark over her as his 
tower was over the foothills. One 
side of his mouth twitched. 

"Little butterfly," he said softly, "do you think you can guard 
me?" 

Everything beautiful about her 
poured out to him through her 
beautiful face, and for a moment 
his world had three suns instead 
of two. He put his arms around 
her. Then his great voice explod


THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



n 



ed with two syllables of a mighty 
laugh. He lifted her and swung 
her behind him, and leaped to 
the parapet. 

Deeply shaken, she came to 
follow his gaze. 

The red sun's foggy limb was 
above the townward horizon, and 
silhouetted against it came the 
van of a procession. On they 
came and on, the ^young men of 
the village, the fathers. Women 
were with them, too, and everything on wheels that the village 
possessed — flat-bed wagons, twowheeled rickshaw carts, children's 
and vendors' and pleasure vehicles. A snorting team of four 
tiger-oxen clawed along before a 
heavily laden stone-boat, and 
men shared packs that swung in 
the center of long poles. 

Osser curled his lip. "You see 
them," he said, as if to himself, 
"doing the only thing they can 
think of. Push them, they yield. 
The clods!" he spat. "Well, one 
day, one will push back. And 
when he does, I'll break him, and 
after that I'll use him. Meantime 
— I have a thousand hands and a 
single mind. We'll see building 
now," he crooned. "When they've 
built, they'll know what they 
don't know now — that they're 
men." 

"They've all come," breathed 
Jubilith. "All of them. Osser—" 

"Be quiet," he said, leaning 
into the wind to watch, gloating. 



With the feel of his hard hands 
still on her back, she discovered 
with a crushing impact that there 
was no room in his heart for her 
when he thought of his building. 
And she knew that there never 
would be, except perhaps for a 
stolen moment, a touch in passing. With the pain of that realization came the certainty that 
she would stay with him always, 
even for so little. 

The procession dipped out of 
sight, then slowly rose over and 
down the near hill and approached the tower. It spread and thickened at the foot of the slope, as 
men cast about, testing the 
ground with their picks, eying 
the land for its color and vegetation and drainage ... or was that 
what they were doing? 

|^SSER leaned his elbows on 
the parapet and shook his 
head pityingly at their inefficiency. Look at the way they went 
about laying out houses! And 
their own houses. Well, he'd let 
them mill about until they were 
completely confused, and then 
he'd go down and make them do 
it his way. Confused men are 
soft men; men working against 
their inner selves are easy to divert from outside. 

Beside him, Jubilith gasped. 

"What is it?" 

She pointed. "There — sending 
the men to this side, that side. 



28 




 



See, by the stone -boat? It's 
Wrenn!" 

"Nonsense!" said Osser. "He'd 
never leave his house. Not to walk 
around among people who are 
sweating. He deals only with people who tell him he's right before 
he speaks." 

"It's Wrenn, it is, it is!" cried 
Jubilith. She clutched his arm. 
"Osser, I'm afraid!" 

"Afraid? Afraid of what? . . . 
By the dying Red One, it is 
Wrenn, telling men what to do as 
if this was his city." He laughed. 
"There are few enough here who 
are strong, Juby, but he's the 
strongest there is. And look at 
him scurry around for me!" 

"I'm afraid," Jubilith whimpered, j 

"They jump , when he tells 
them," said Osser reflectively, 
shading his eyes. "Perhaps I was 
wrong to let them tire themselves 
out before I help them do things 
right. With a man like him to 
push them- . . . Hm. I think we'll 
get it done right the first time." 

He pushed himself away from 
the parapet and swung to the 
stairway. 

"Osser, don't, please don't!" 
she begged. 

He stopped just long enough 
to give her a glance like a stone 
thrown. "You'll never change my 
mind, Juby, and you'll be hurt 
if you try too often." He dropped 
into the opening, went down 



three steps, five steps . . . 

He grunted, stopped. 

Jubilith came slowly over to 
the stairwell. Osser stood on the 
sixth step, on tiptoe. Impossibly 
on tiptoe : the points of his sandals barely touched the step at 
all 

He set his jaw and placed his 
massive hands one on each side 
of the curved wall. He pressed 
them out and up, forcing himself 
downward. His sandals touched 
more firmly; his toes bent, his 
heels made contact. His face became deep red, and the cords at 
the sides of his neck ridged like 
a weathered fallow-field. 

A strained crackle came from 
his shoulders, and then the pent 
breath burst from him. His hands 
slipped, and he came up again 
just the height of the single stairriser, to bob ludicrously like a 
boat at anchor, his pointed toe 
touching and lifting from the 
sixth step. 

He gave an inarticulate roar, 
bent double, and plunged his 
hands downward as if to dive 
head-first down the stairs. His 
wrists turned under and he yelped with the pain. More cautiously he felt around and down, from 
wall to wall. It was as if the air 
in the stairway had solidified, 
become at once viscous and resilient. Whatever was there was 
invisible and completely impassable. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



29 



* 



TlE backed slowly up the steps. 

On his face there was fury 
and frustration, hurt and a shaking reaction. 

Jubilith wrung her hands. 
"Please, please, Osser, be care — " 

The sound of her voice gave 
him something to strike out at, 
and he spun about, raising his 
great bludgeon of a fist. Jubilith 
stood frozen; too shocked to 
dodge the blow. 

"Osser!" 

Osser stopped, tensed high, fist 
up, like some terrifying monument to vengeance. The voice 
had been Wrenn's — Wrenn speaking quietly, even conversationally, 
but magnified beyond belief. The 
echoes of it rolled off and were 
lost in the hills. 

"Come watch men building, 
Osser!" 

Dazed, Osser lowered his t arm 
and went to the parapet. 

Far below, near the base of the 
hill, Wrenn' stood, looking up at 
the tower. When Osser appeared, 
Wrenn turned his back and signaled the men by the stone -boat. 
They twitched away the tarpaulin that covered its load. 

Osser's hands gripped the stone 
as if they would powder it. His 
eyes slowly widened and his jaw 
slowly dropped. 

At first it seemed like a mound 
of silver on the rude platform of 
the ox-drawn stone-boat. Gradually he perceived that it was a 



machine, a machine so finished, 
so clean-lined and so businesslike that the pictures he had 
shown Jubilith were clumsy toys 
in comparison. 

It was Sussten, a man Osser 
had crushed to the ground with 
two heavy blows, who sprang 
lightly up on the machine and 
settled into it. It backed off the 
platform, and Osser could hear 
the faintest of whines from it. 
The machine rolled and yet it 
stepped; it kept itself horizonlevel as it ran, its long endless 
treads dipping and rising with 
the terrain, its sleek body moving 
smooth as a swan. It stopped and 
then went forward, out to the first 
of a field of stakes that a crew 
had been driving. 

The flat, gleaming sides of the 
machine opened away and forward and locked, and became a 
single blade twice the width of 
the machine. It dropped until 
its sharp lower edge just touched 
the ground, checked for a moment, and then sank into the 
soil. 

Dirt mounded up before it 
until flakes fell back over the 
wide moldboard. The machine 
slid ahead, and dirt ran off the 
sides of the blade to make two 
straight windrows. And behind 
the machine as it labored, the 
ground was flat and smooth; and 
it was done as easily as a smoothing hand in a sandbox. Here it 



30 




 



was cut and there it was filled, 
but everywhere the swath was 
like planed wood, all done just 
as fast as a man can run. 

Osser made a sick noise far 
back in his tight throat. 

GUIDED by the stakes, the 
machine wheeled and returned, one end of the blade now 
curved forward to catch up the 
windrow 'and carry it across the 
new parallel cut. And now the 
planed soil was twice as wide. 

As it worked, men worked, and 
Osser saw that, shockingly, they 
moved with no less efficiency and 
certainty than the machine. For 
Osser, these men had plodded and 
sweated, drudged, each a single, 
obstinate unit to be flogged and 
pressed. But now they sprinted, 
sprang; they held, drove, measured and carried as if to swift 
and intricate music. 

A cart clattered up and from it 
men took metal spikes, as thick 
as a leg, twice as tall as a man. 
Four men to a spike, they ran 
with them to staked positions on 
the new-cut ground, set them 
upright. A man flung a metal 
clamp around the spike. Two 
men, one on each side, drove 
down on the clamp with heavy 
sledges until the spike would 
stand alone. And already those 
four were back with another 
spike. 

Twenty-six such spikes were 



set, but long before they were all 
out of the wagon, Sussten spun 
the machine in its own length 
and stopped. The moldboard 
rose, hinged, folded back to become the silver sides of the machine again. Sussten drove 
forward, nosed the machine into 
the first of the spikes, which fitted into a slot at the front of the 
machine. There was the sound of 
a frantic giant ringing a metal 
triangle, and the spike sank as if 
the ground had turned to bread. 

Leaving perhaps two hand'sbreadths of the spike showing, 
the machine slid to the next and 
the next, sinking the spikes so 
quickly that it had almost it 
whole minute to wait while the 
spike crew set the very last one. 
At that a sound rolled out of the 
crowd, a sound utterly unlike 
any that had ever been heard 
during the building of the tower 
— a friendly, jeering roar of 
laughter at the crew who had 
made the machine wait. 

Men unrolled heavy cable 
along the lines of spikes; others 
followed right behind them, one 
with a tool which stretched the 
cable taut, two with a tool that 
in two swift motions connected 
the cable to the tops of the sunken spikes. And by the time the 
cable was connected, two flatbeds, a buckboard and a hay 
wagon had unloaded a cluster of 
glistening machine parts. Men 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



31 



and women swarmed over them, 
wrenches, pliers and special tools 
in hand, bolting, fitting, clamping, connecting. Three heavy 
leads from the great ground cable 
were connected; a great parabolic 
wire basket was raised and guyed. 

Wrenn ran to the structure 
and pulled a lever. A high-pitched scream of force dropped sickeningly in pitch to a jarring 
subsonic, and rose immediately 
high out of the audible range. 

A rosy haze enveloped the end 
of the new machine, opposite the 
ground array and under the basket. It thickened, shimmere4, and 
steadied, until it was a stable 



glowing sphere with an off-focus 
muzziness barely showing all 
around its profile. 

HHHE crowd — not a group now, 
but a line — cheered and the 
line moved forward. Every conceivable village conveyance 
moved in single file toward the 
shining sphere, and, as each 
stopped, heavy metal was unloaded. Cast-iron stove legs 
could be recognized, and long 
strips of tinning solder, a bell, a 
kettle, the framing of a bench. 
The blacksmith's anvil was there, 
and parts of his forge. Pots and 
skillets. A ratchet and pawl from 




32 




 



the gristmill. The weights and 
pendulum from the big village 
clock. 

As each scrap was unloaded, 
exactly the number of hands demanded by its weight were waiting to catch it, swing it from its 
conveyance into the strange 
sphere. They went in without 
resistance and without sound, 
and they did not come out. Wagon after wagon, pack after handsack were unloaded, and still the 
sphere took and took. 

It took heavy metal of more 
mass than its own dimensions. 
Had the metal been melted down 
into a sphere, it would have been 



a third again, half again, twice 
as large as the sphere, and still 
it took. 

But its color was changing. The 
orange went to burned sienna and 
then to a strident brown. Imperceptibly this darkened until 
at last it was black. For a moment, it was a black of impossible 
glossiness, but this softened. 
Blacker and blacker it became, 
and at length it was not a good 
thing to look into— the blackness 
seemed to be hungry for something more intimate than metal. 
And still the metals came and 
the sphere took. 

A great roar came from the 




THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



33 



crowd; men fell back to look upward. High in the west was a 
glowing golden spark which 
showed a long blue tail. It raced 
across the sky and was gone, and 
moments later the human roar 
was answered by thunder from 
above. 

If the work had been swift before, it now became a blur. Men 
no longer waited for the line of 
wagons to move, but ran back 
along it to snatch metal and stagger forward again to the sphere. 
Women ripped off bracelets and 
hammered earrings and threw 
them to the implacable melanosphere. Men threw in their knives, 
even their buttons. A rain of 
metal was sucked silently into 
the dazzling black. 

Another cry from the crowd, 
and now there was hurried anguish in it; again the craning 
necks, the quick gasp. The golden 
spark was a speed-blurred ovoid 
now, the blue tail a banner half 
a horizon long. The roar, when 
it came, was a smashing thunder, 
and the blue band hung where it 
was long after the thing had gone. 

A moan of urgency, caught and 
maintained by one exhausted 
throat after another, rose and fell 
and would not leave. Then it was 
a happy shout as Sussten drove 
in, shouldering the beautiful cutting machine through the scattering crowd. Its blade unfolded as 
it ran, latched high and stayed 



there like a shining forearm flung 
across the machine's silver face. 

As the last scrambling people 
dove for safety, Sussten brought 
the huge blade slashing downward and at the same time threw 
the machine into its highest 
speed. It leaped forward as Sussten leaped back. Unmanned, it 
rushed at the sphere as if to 
sweep it away, crash the structure that contained it. But at the 
last micro-second, the blade 
struck the ground; the nose of 
the machine snapped upward, 
and the whole gleaming thing 
literally vaulted into the sphere. 

TVTO words exist for such a 
-•"^ black. Some people fell to 
their knees, their faces covered. 
Some turned blindly away, unsteady on their feet. Some stood 
trembling, fixed on it, until 
friendly hands took and turned 
them and coaxed them back to 
reality. # 

And at last a man staggered 
close, squinting, and threw in the 
heavy wrought-iron support for 
an inn sign — 

And the sphere refused it. 

Such a cry of joy rose from 
the village that the sleeping bats 
in the thickets of Sky-tree Grove, 
two miles away, stirred and added their porcine grunting to the 
noise. 

A woman ran to Wrenn, 
screaming, elbowing, unnoticed 



34 




 



and unheard in the bedlam. She 
caught his shoulder roughly, spun 
him half around, pointed. Pointed up at the tower, at Osser. 

Wrenn thumbed a small disc 
out of a socket in his belt and 
held it near his lips. 

"Osser!" The great voice rang 
and echoed, crushing the ecstatic 
noises of the people by its sheer 
weight. "Osser, come down or 
you're a dead man!" 

The people, suddenly silent, all 
stared at the tower. One or two 
cried, "Yes, come down, come 
down . . ." but the puniness of 
their voices was ludicrous after 
Wrenn's magnified tones, and 
few tried again. 

Osser stood holding the parapet, legs wide apart, eyes wide— 
too wide — open. His hands curled over the edge, and blood dripped slowly from under the 
cuticles. 

"Come down, come down . . ." 

He did not move. His eyeballs 
were nearly dry, and unnoticed 
saliva lay in a drying streak from 
one corner of his mouth. 

"Jubilith, bring him down!" 

She was whimpering, begging, 
murmuring little urgencies to 
him. His biceps were as hard as 
the parapet, his face as changeless as the stone. 

"Jubilith, leave him! Leave 
him and come!" Wrenn, wise 
Wrenn, sure, unshakable, imperturbable Wrenn had a sob in his 



voice; and under such amplification the sob was almost big 
enough to be voice for the sobs 
that twisted through Jubilith's 
tight throat. 

She dropped to one knee and 
put one slim firm shoulder under 
Osser's wrist. She drove upward 
against it with all the lithe 
strength of her panicked body. It 
came free, leaving a clot of fingertip on the stone. Down she went 
again, and up again at the other 
wrist; but this was suddenly 
flaccid, and her tremendous effort turned to a leap. She clutched 
at Osser, who tottered forward. 

For one endless second they 
hung there, while their mutual 
center of gravity made a slow deliberation, and then Jubilith 
kicked frantically at the parapet, 
abrading her legs, mingling her 
blood with his on the masonry. 
They went together back to the 
roof. Jubilith twisted like a falling cat and got her feet down, 
holding Osser's great weight up. 

They spun across the roof in 
an insane staggering dance; then 
there was the stairway (with its 
invisible barrier gone) and darkness (with his hand in hers now, 
holding and leading) and a 
sprint into daylight and the shattering roar of Wrenn's giant 
voice: "Everybody down, down 
flat!" 

And there was a time of running, pulling Osser after her, and 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



35 



Osser pounding along behind her, 
docile and wide-eyed as a cat-ox. 
And then the rebellion and failure of her legs, and the will that 
refused to let them fail, and the 
failure of that will; the stunning 
agony of a cracked patella as she 
went down on the rocks, and the 
swift sense of infinite loss as Osser's hand pulled free of hers and 
he went lumbering blindly along, 
the only man on his feet in the 
wide meadow of the fallen. 

Jubilith screamed and someone 
stood up — she thought it was old 
Oyva — and cried out. 

Then the mighty voice again, 
"Osser/ Down, man!" Blearily, 
then, she saw Osser stagger to a 
halt and peer around him. 

"Osser, lie down!" 

k ND then Osser, mad, drooling, 
turning toward her. His eyes 
protruded and he slashed about 
with his heavy fists. He came 
closer, unseeing, battling some 
horror he believed in with great 
cuts and slashes that threatened 
elbow and shoulder joints by the 
wrenching of their unimpeded 
force. 

His voice — but not his, rather 
the voice of an old, wretched 
crone — squeaking out in a shrill 
falsetto, "Not down, never down, 
but up. I'll build, build, build, 
break to build, kill to build, and 
all the ones who can do everything, anything, everything, they 



will build everything for me. I'm 
strong!" he shrieked, soprano. 
"All the people who can do anything are less than one strong 
man . . ." 

He jabbered and fought, and 
suddenly Wrenn rose, quite close 
by, his left hand enclosed in a 
round flat box. He moved something on its surface and then 
waved it at Osser, in a gesture 
precisely like the command to 
a guest to be seated. 

Down went Osser, close to 
Jubilith, with his face in the dirt 
and his eyes open, uncaring. On 
him and on Jubilith lay the invisible weight of the force that 
had awaited him in the stairway. 

The breath hissed out of Jubilith. Had she not been lying on 
her side with her face turned skyward in a single convulsive effort 
toward air, she would never have 
seen what happened. The golden 
shape appeared in the west, seen 
a fraction of a second, but blazoned forever in tangled memories 
of this day. And simultaneously 
the earth-shaking cough of the 
machine as its sphere disappeared. 

She could not see it move, but 
such a blackness is indelible, and 
she sensed it when it appeared in 
the high distances as its trajectory and that of the golden flyer 
intersected. 

Then there was — Nothing. 



36 




 



fT*HE broad blue trail swept 
from the western horizon to 
the zenith, and sharply ended. 
There was no sound, no. concussion, no blaze of light. The sphere 
met the ship and both ceased to 
exist. 

Then there was the wind, from 
nowhere, from everywhere, all 
the wind that ever was, tearing in 
agony from everywhere in the 
world to the place where the 
sphere had been, trying to fill the 
strange space that had contained 
exactly as much matter as the 
dead golden ship. Wagons, oxen, 
trees and stones scraped and flew 
and crashed together in the center 
of that monstrous implosion. 

The weight Wrenn had laid on 
Jubilith disappeared, but her 
sucking lungs could find nothing 
to draw in. There was air aplenty, 
but none of it would serve her. 

Finally she realized that there 
was unconsciousness waiting for 
her if she wanted it. She embraced it, sank into it, and left 
the world to its wailing winds. 

Ages later, there was weeping. 

She stirred and raised her 
head. 

The sphere machine was gone. 
There was a heap of something 
down there, but it supported such 
a tall and heavy pillar of roiling 
dust that she could not see what 
it was. There, and there, and over 
yonder, in twos and threes, silent, shaken people sat up, some 



staring about them, some just 
sitting, waiting for the shockstopped currents of life to flow 
back in. 

But the weeping . . . 

She put her palm on the ground 
and inched it, heel first, in a 
weak series of little hops, until 
she was half sitting. 

Osser was weeping. 

He sat upright, his feet together and his knees wide apart, 
like a little child. He rocked. He 
lifted his hands and let them fall, 
lifted them and punctuated his 
crying with weak poundings on 
the ground. His mouth was an O, 
his eyes were single squeezed 
' lines, his face was wet, and his 
crying was the most heartrending 
sound she had ever heard. 

She thought to speak to him, 
but knew he would not hear. She 
thought to go to him, but the 
first shift of weight sent such 
, agony through her broken kneecap that she almost fainted. 

Osser wept. 

She turned away from him — 
suppose, later, he should remember that she had seen this? — and 
then she knew why he. was crying. He was crying because his 
tower was gone. Tower of 
strength, tower of defiance, tower 
of hope, tower of rebellion and 
hatred and an ambition big 
enough for a whole race of citybuilders, gone without a fight, 
gone without the triumph of tak


T H E TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



37 



ing him with it, gone in an instant, literally in a puff of wind. 

"Where does it hurt?" 

It was Wrenn, who had approached unseen through the 
blinding, sick compassion that 
filled her. 

"It hurts there." She pointed 
briefly at Osser. 

"I know," said Wrenn gently. 
He checked what she was about 
to say with a gesture. "No, we 
won't stop him. When he was a 
little boy, he never cried. He has 
been hurt more than most people, 
and nothing ever made him cry, 
ever. We all have a cup for tears 
and a reservoir. No childhood is 
finished until all the tears flow 
from the reservoir into the cup. 
Let him cry; perhaps he is going 
to be a man. It's your knee, isn't 
it?" 

"Yes. Oh, but I can't stand to 
hear it, my heart will burst!" she 
cried. 

"Hear him out," said Wrenn 
softly, taking medication from a 
flat box at his waist. He ran 
feather-fingers over her knee and 
nodded. "You have taken Osser 
as your own. Keep this weeping 
with you, all of it. It will fit you 
to him better through the healing time." 

"May I understand now?" 

"Yes, oh yes . . . and since he 
has taught you about hate, you 
will hate me for it." 

"I couldn't hate you, Wrenn." 



Something stirred within his 
placid eyes — a smile, a pointed 
shard of knowledge — she was not 
sure. "Perhaps you could." 

TTE kept his eyes on his careful bandaging, and as he 
worked, he spoke. 

"Stop a man in his work to tell 
him that each of his fingers bears 
a pattern of loops and whorls, 
and you waste his time. It is a 
thing he knows, a thing he has 
seen for himself, a thing which 
can be checked on the instant — 
in short, an obvious, unremarkable thing. Yet, if his attention is 
not called to it, it is impossible to 
teach him that these patterns are 
exclusive, original with him, unduplicated anywhere. Sparing 
him the truism may cost him the 
fact. 

"It is that kind of truism 
through which I shall pass to 
reach the things you must understand. So be patient with me 
through the familiar paths; I 
promise you a most remarkable 
turning. 

"We are an ancient and resourceful species, and among the 
many things we have — our happiness, our simplicity, our harmony with each other and with 
ourselves — some are the products 
of intelligence, per se, but most 
of the good things spring from a 
quality which we possess in greater degree than any other species 



38 




 



yet known. That is — logic: 

"Now, there is the obvious 
logic: you may never have broken your knee before, but you 
knew, in advance, that if you 
did it would cause you pain. If 
I hold this pebble so, you may 
correctly predict that it will drop 
when I release it, though you 
have never seen this stone before. 
This obvious logic strikes deeper 
levels as well; for example, if I 
release the stone and it does not 
fall, logic tells you not only that 
some unpredicted force is now 
acting on it, but a great many 
things about that force: that it 
equals gravity in the case of this 
particular pebble; that it is in 
stasis; that it is phenomenal, 
since it is out of the statistical 
order of things. 

"The quality of logic, which 
we (so far as is known) uniquely 
possess, is this,: any of us can do 
literally anything that anyone 
else can do. You need ask no one 
to solve the problems that you 
face every day, providing they 
are problems common to all. To 
cut material so that a sleeve will 
fit a shoulder, you pause, you 
» close your eyes; the way to cut 
the material then comes to you, 
and you proceed. You never need 
do anything twice, because the 
first way is the most logical. You 
may finish the garment and put 
it away without trying it on for 
fit, because you know you have 



done it right and it is perfect. 

"If I put you before a machine 
which you had never seen before, 
which had a function unknown to 
you, and which operated on principles you had never heard of, 
and if I told you it was broken 
and needed repairing, you would 
look at it carefully, inside, outside, top and bottom, and you 
would close your eyes, and suddenly you would understand the 
principles. With these and the 
machine, function would explain 
itself. The step from that point 
to the location of a faulty part 
is self-evident. 

"Now I lay before you parts 
which are identical in appearance, 
and ask you to install the correct 
one. Since you thoroughly understand the requirements now, the 
specifications for the correct part 
are self-evident. Logic dictates 
the correct tests for the parts. 
You will rapidly reject the tight 
one, the heavy one, the too soft 
one, and the too resilient one, 
and you will repair my machine. 
And you will walk away without 
testing it, since you now know it 
will operate." 

WRElNN continued, "You— 
all of us — live in this way. 
We build no cities because we 
don't need cities. We stay in 
groups because some things need 
more than two hands, more than 
one head, or voice, or mood. We 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



39 



eat exactly what we require, we 
use only what we need. 

"And that is the end of the 
truism, wherein I so meticulously 
describe to you what you know 
about how you live. The turning: Whence this familiar phenomenon, this closing of the eyes 
and mysterious appearance of the 
answer? There have been many 
engrossing theories about it, but 
the truth is the most fascinating 
of all. 

" "We have all spoken of telepathy, and many of us have experienced it. We cannot explain 
it, as yet. But most of us insist 
on a limited consideration of it; 
that is, we judge its success or 
failure by the amount of detail 
sent and received. We expect 
facts to be transmitted, words, 
idea sequences — or perhaps pictures; the clearer the picture, the 
better the telepathy. 

"Perhaps one day we will learn 
to do this; it would be diverting. 
But what we actually do is infinitely more useful. 

"You see, we are telepathic, 
not in the way of conveying details, but in the much more useful 
way of conveying a manner of 
thinking. 

"Let us try to envisage a man 
who lacks this quality. Faced 
with your broken machine, he 
would be utterly at a loss, unless 
he had been specially trained in 
this particular field. Do not over


look the fact that he lacks the 
conditioning of a whole life of 
the kind of sequence thinking 
which is possible to us. He would 
probably bumble through the 
whole chore in an interminable 
time, trying one thing and then 
another and going forward from 
whatever seems to work. You can 
see the tragic series of pitfalls 
possible for him in a situation in 
which an alternate three or four 
or five consecutive steps are possible, forcing step six, which is 
wrong in terms of the problem. 

"Now, take the same man and 
train him in this one job. Add a 
talent, so that he learns quickly 
and well. Add years of experience — terrible, drudging thought! 
— to his skill. Face him with the 
repair problem and it is obvious 
that he will repair it with a minimum of motion. 

"Finally, take this skilled man 
and equip him with a device 
which constantly sends out the 
habit-patterns of his thinking. 
Long practice has made him efficient in the matter; in terms of 
machine function he knows better than to question whether a 
part turns this way or that, 
whether a rod or tube larger than 
x diameter is to be considered. 
Furthermore, imagine a receiving 
device which absorbs these sendings whenever the receiver is 
faced with an identical problem. 
The skilled sender controls the 



40 




 



unskilled receiver as long as the 
receiver is engaged in the problem. Anything the receiver does 
which is counter to the basic 
patterns of the sender is automatically rejected as illogical. 

"And now I have described our 
species. We have an unmatchable 
unitary existence. Each of us with 
-a natural bent — the poets, the 
musicians, the mechanics, the philosophers—each gives of his basic 
thinking method every time anyone has an application for it. The 
t expert is unaware of being tapped 
— which is why it has taken hundreds of centuries to recognize the 
method. Yet, in spite of what 
amounts to a veritable race intellect, we are all very much individuals. Because each field has many 
experts, and each of those experts 
has his individual approach, only 
that which is closest both to the 
receiver and his problem comes 
in. The ones without special talents live fully and richly with all 
the skills of the gifted. The creative ones share with others in 
their field as soon as it occurs 
to any expert to review what he 
knows; the one step forward then 
instantly presents itself. 

"^JO much for the bulk of our 
^ kind. There remain a few 
specializing non-specialists. When 
you are faced with a problem to 
which no logical solution presents 
itself, you come to one of these 



few for help. The reason no solution presents itself is that this is 
a new line of thinking, or (which 
is very* unlikely) the last expert 
in it has died. The non-specialist 
hears your problem and applies 
simple logic to it. Immediately, 
others of his kind do the same. 
But, since they come from widely divergent backgrounds and 
use a vast variety of methods, 
one of them is almost certain to^ 
find the logical solution. This is 
your answer — and through you, 
it is available to anyone who ever 
faces this particular problem. 

"In exceptional cases, the nonspecializing specialist encounters 
a problem which, for good reason, is better left out of the racial 
'pool' — as, for example, a physical or psychological experiment 
within the culture, of long duration, which general knowledge 
might alter. In such cases, a highly specialized hypnotic technique 
is used on the investigators, 
which has the effect of cloaking 
thought on this particular matter. 

"And if you began to fear that 
I was never coming to Osser's 
unhappy history, you must understand, my dear, I have just 
given it to you. Osser was just 
such an experiment. 

"It became desirable to study 
the probable habit patterns of a 
species like us in every respect 
except for our unique attribute. 
The problem was attacked from 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



41 



many angles, but I must confess 
that using a live specimen was 
my idea. 

"By deep hypnosis, the telepathic receptors in Osser were 
severed from the rest of his mind. 
He was then allowed to grow up 
among us in real and complete 
freedom. 

"You saw the result. Since few 
people recognize the nature of 
this unique talent, and even fewer regard it as worth discussion, 
this strong, proud, highly intelligent boy grew up feeling a hopeless inferior, -and never knowing 
exactly why. Others did things, 
made things, solved problems, as 
easily as thinking about them, 
while Osser had to study and 
sweat and piece and try out. He 
had to assert his superiority in 
some way. He did, but in as slipshod a fashion as he did everything else. 

"So he was led to the pictures 
you saw. He was permitted to 
make what conclusions he wished 
— they were that we are a backward people, incapable of building a city. He suddenly saw in 
the dreams of a mechanized, starreaching species a justification of 
himself. He could not understand 
our lack of desire for possessions, 
not knowing that our whole cultural existence is based on sharing 
— that it is not only undesirable, 
but impossible for us to hoard an 
advanced idea, a new comfort. 



He would master us through 
strength. 

"He was just starting when 
you came to me about him. You 
could get no key to his problem 
because we know nothing about 
sick minds, and there was no expert you could tap. I couldn't 
help you — you, of all people — 
because you loved him, and because we dared not risk having 
him know what he was, especially when he was just about to 
take action. 

"Why he chose this particular 
site for his tower I do not know. 
And why he chose the method of 
the tower I don't know either, 
though I can deduce an excellent 
reason. First, he had to use his 
strength once he became convinced that in it lay his superiority. Second, he had to try out 
this build-with-hate idea — the 
bugaboo of all other man-species, 
the trial-and-error, the inability 
to know what will work and what 
will not. 

"And so we learned through 
Osser precisely what we had 
learned in other approaches — 
that a man without our particular ability must not live among 
us, for, if he does, he will destroy 
us. 

"It is a small step from that to 
a conclusion about a whole race 
of them coexisting with us. And 
now you know what happened 
here this afternoon."

JUBILITH raised her head 
slowly. "A whole ship full of 
... of what Osser was?" 

"Yes. We did the only thing 
we could. Quick, quite painless. 
We have been watching them for 
a long time — years. We saw them 
start. We computed their orbit 
— even to the deceleration spiral. 
We chose a spot to launch our 
interceptor." He glanced at Osser, who was almost quiet, quite 
exhausted. "What sheer hell he 
must have gone through, to see 
us build like that. How could he 
know that not one of us needed 
training, explanation, or any but 
the simplest orders? How could 
he rationalize to himself our possession of machines and devices 
surpassing the wildest dreams of 
the godlike men he admired so? 
How could he understand that, 
having such things, we use them 
only when we must, and that 
otherwise we live in ways which 
will not violate the walking, 
working animal we are?" 

She turned to him a mask so 
cold, so beautiful, he forgot for a 
moment to breathe. "Why did 
you do it? You had other logics, 
other approaches. Did you have 
to do that to him?" 

He studiously avoided a glance 
at Osser. "I said you might hate 
me," he murmured. "Jubilith, the 
men in that ship were so like 
Osser that the experiment could 
not be passed by. We had astro


nomical data, historical, cultural 
— as far as our observations could 
go — and ethnological. But only 
by analogy could we get such a 
psychological study. And it 
checked too well. As for having 
him see this thing, today . . . 
building, Jubilith, is sometimes 
begun by tearing down." 

He looked at her with deep 
compassion. "This was not the 
site chosen for the launching of 
the interceptor. We uprooted the 
whole installation, brought it 
here, rebuilt it, just for Osser; 
just so that he could stand on his 
tower and see it happen. He had 
to be broken, leveled to the earth. 
Ah-h-h . . ." he breathed painfully, "Osser has earned what he 
will have from now on." 

"He can be — well again?" 

"With your help." 

"So very right, you are," she 
snarled suddenly. "So sure that 
this or that species is fit to associate with superiors like us." She 
leaned toward him and shook a 
finger in his startled face. The 
courtly awe habitual to all when 
speaking to such as Wrenn had 
completely left her. 

"So fine we are, so mighty. And 
didn't we build cities? Didn't we 
have giant bird-machines and 
shiny carts on our streets? Didn't 
we let our cities be smashed — 
haven't you seen the ruins in the 
west? Tell me," she sparked, "did 
we ruin them ourselves, because

one superior city insisted on proving its superiority over another 
superior city?" 

SHE stopped abruptly to keep 
herself from growling like an 
animal, for he was smiling blandly, and his smile got wider as she 
spoke. She turned furiously, half 
away from him, cursing the broken knee that held her so helpless. 
"Jubilith." 

His voice was so warm, so kind 
and so startling in these surroundings, held such a bubbling 
overtone of laughter that she 
couldn't res'ist it. She turned 
grudgingly. 

In his hand he held a pebble. 
When her eye fell to it he rolled 
it, held it between thumb and 
forefinger, and let it go. 

It stayed motionless in midair. "Another factor, Jubilith." 

She almost smiled. She looked 
down at his other hand, and saw 
it aiming the disc-shaped forcefield projector at low power. 

He lifted it and, with the field, 
tossed the pebble into the air and 
batted it away. "We have no 
written history, Jubilith. We 
don't need one, but once in a 
while it would be useful. 

"Jubilith, our culture is one of 
the oldest in the Galaxy. If we 
ever had such cities, there are 
not even legends about it." 

"But I saw—" 

"A ship came here once. We 



had never seen a humanoid race. 
We welcomed them and helped 
them. We gave them land and 
seeds: Then they called a flotilla, 
and the ships came by the hundreds. 

"They built cities and, at that, 
we moved away and left them 
alone, because we don't need 
cities. Then they began to hate 
us. They couldn't hate us until 
they had tall buildings to do it 
in. They hated our quiet; they 
hated our understanding. They 
sent missionaries to change our 
ways. We welcomed the missionaries, fed them and laughed with 
them, but when they left us 
glittering tools and humble machines to amuse us, we let them 
lie where they were until they 
rotted. 

"In time they sent no more 
missionaries. They joked about 
us and forgot us. And then they 
built a city on land we had not 
given them, and another, and another. They bred well, and their 
cities became infernally big. And 
finally they began to build that 
one city too many, and we turned 
a river and drowned it. They were 
pleased. They could now rid 
themselves of the backward natives." 

JUBILITH closed her eyes, and 
saw the tumbled agony of the 
mounds, radiating outward from 
a lake with its shores too bare.

"All of them?" she asked. 

Wrenn nodded. "Even one 
might be enough to destroy us." 
He nodded toward Osser, who 
had begun to cry again. 

"They seemed . . . good," she 
said, reflectively. "Too fast, too 
big . . . and it must have been 
noisy, but — " 

"Wait," he said. "You mean the 
people in the picture Osser 
showed you?" 

"Of course. They were the citybuilders you — we — destroyed, 
weren't they?" 

"They were not! The ones who 
built here were thin, hairy, with 
backward-slanting faces andwebs 
between their fingers. Beautiful, 
but they hated us . . . The pictures, Jubilith, were made on the 
third planet of a pale star out 
near the Rim; a world with one 
Moon; a world of humans like 
Osser . . . the world where that 
golden ship came from." 

"How?" she gasped. 

"If logic is good enough," 
Wrenn said, "it need not be 
checked. Once we were so treated 
by humanoids, we built the investigators. They are not manned. 
They draw their power from anything that radiates, and they 
home on any planet which could 
conceivably rear humans. They 
are, as far as we know, indetectible. We've never lost one. 
They launch tiny flyers to make 
close searches — one of them made 



the pictures you saw. The pictures and other data are coded 
and sent out into space and, 
where distances warrant it, other 
investigators catch the signal and 
add power and send them on. 

"Whenever a human or humanoid species builds a ship, we 
watch it. When they send their 
ships to this sector, we watch 
their planet and their ship. Unless we are sure that those people 
have the ability we have, to share 
all expertness and all creative 
thinking with all who want it — 
they don't land here. And no 
such species ever will land here." 

"You're so sure." 

"We explore no planets, Jubilith. We like it here. If others 
like us exist — why should they 
visit us?" 

She thought about it, and slowly she nodded. "I like it here," 
she breathed. 

WRENN knelt and looked out 
across the rolling ground. It 
was late, and most of the villagers had gone home. A few 
picked at the mound of splinters 
at the implosion center. Their 
limbs were straight and their faces 
clear. They owned little and they 
shared their sOuls. 

He rose and went to Osser, and 
sat down beside him, facing him, 
his back to Jubilith. "M-m-mum, 
mum, mum, mum, mum-mummum," he intoned. 



THE TOUCH OF YOUR HAND 



45 



Osser blinked at him. Wrenn 
lifted his hand and his ring, green 
and gold and a shimmering oval 
of purple, caught the late light. 
Osser looked at the ring. He 
reached for it. Wrenn moved it 
slightly. Osser's hand passed it 
and hit the ground and lay there 
neglected. Osser gaped at the ring, 
his jaws working, his teeth not 
meeting. 

"Mum, mum, mummy, where's 
your mummy, Osser?" 

"In the house," said Osser, 
looking at the ring. 

Wrenn said, "You're a good 
little boy. When we say the word, 
you won't be able to do anything but what you can do. When 
we say -the key, you'll be able 
to do anything anybody can do." 

"All right," Osser said. 

"Before I give the word, tell me 
the key. You must remember the 
key." 

"That ring. And 'last 'n' lost.' " 

"Good, Osser. Now listen to me. 
Can you hear me?" 

"Sure." He grabbed at the ring. 

"I'm going to change the key. 
It isn't 'last 'n' lost' any more. 
'Last 'n' lost' is no good now. 
Forget it." 

"No good?" 

"Forget it. What's the key?" 
"I — forgot." 

"The key," said Wrenn patiently, "is this." He leaned close* and 
whispered rapidly. 

Jubilith was peering out past 



the implosion center to the townward path. Someone was coming, 
a tiny figure. 

"Judilith," Wrenn said. She 
looked up at him. "You must 
understand something." His voice 
was grave. His hair reached for 
an awed little twist of wind, come 
miles to see this place: The wind 
escaped and ran away down the 
hill. 

Wrenn said, "He's very happy 
now. He was a happy child when 
first I heard of him, and how like 
a spacebound human he could be. 
Well, he's that child again. He 
always will be, until the day he 
dies. I'll see he's cared for. He'll 
chase the sunbeams, a velvet red 
one and a needle of blue-white; 
he'll eat and he'll love and be 
loved just as is right for him." 

They looked at Osser. There 
was a blue insect on his wrist. 
He raised it slowly, slowly, close 
to his eyes, and through its gauze 
wings he saw the flame-and-silver 
sunset. He laughed. 

"All his life?" 

"All his life," said Wrenn. 
"With the bitterness and the 
trouble wiped away, and no 
chance to mature again into the 
unfinished thing that fought the 
world with the conviction it had 
something extra." 

Then he dropped the ring into 
Jubilith's hand. "But if you care 
to," he said, watching her face, 
the responsive motion of her sen


46 




 



sitive nostrils, the most delicate 
index of her lower lip, "if you 
care to, yoii can give him back 
everything I took away. In a 
moment, you can give him more 
than he has now; but how long 
would it take you to make him 
as happy?" 

She made no attempt to answer 
him. He was Wrenn, he was old 
and wise; he was a member of a 
unique species whose resources 
were incalculable; and yet he 
was asking her to do something 
he could not do himself. Perhaps 
he was asking her to correct a 
wrong. She would never know 
that. 

"Just the ring," he said, "and 
the touch of your hand." 

He went aWay, straight and 
tall, quickening his pace as, far 
away, the patient figure she had 
been watching earlier rose and 
came to meet him. It was Oyva. 

Jubilith thought, "He needs 
her." 

Jubilith had never been needed 
by anyone. 

She looked at her hand and 
in it she saw all she was, all she 
could ever be in her own right; 
and with it, the music of ages; 



never the words, but all of thepressures of poetry. And she saw 
the extraordinary privacy of love 
in a world which looked out 
through her eyes, placed all of its 
skills in her hands, to do with 
as she alone wished. 

With a touch of her hand . . . 
what a flood of sensation, what 
a bursting in of voices and knowledge, for a child! 

How long a child? 

She closed her eyes, and quietly 
the answer came, full of pictures; 
the lute picked up and played; 
the instant familiarity with the 
most intricate machine; the stars 
seen otherwise, and yet . again 
otherwise, and every seeing an 
honest beauty. A thousand discoveries, and manhood with a 
rush. 

She slipped the ring on her 
finger, and dragged herself over 
to him. She put her arms around 
him and his cheek came down to 
the hollow of her throat and burrowed there. 

He said, sleepily, "Is it nighttime, Mummy?" 

"For just a little while," said 
Jubilith.
