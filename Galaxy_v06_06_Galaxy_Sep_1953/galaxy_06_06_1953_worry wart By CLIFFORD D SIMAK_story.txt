worrywart By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 



CHARLEY PORTER is a 
copyreader on the Daily 
Times and a copyreader 
is a funny kind of critter. He is 
a comma watcher and a word 



butcher and a mighty tide of 
judgment set against the news. 
He's a sort of cross between a 
walking encyclopedia and an ambulatory index. 

Occasionally you meet a reporter or an editor or you see 
their pictures or you hear them 
spoken of. But you never hear 
about a copyreader. 

The copyreader sits with his 
fellow copyreaders at a horseshoe-shaped table. If he's an old 
time copyreader, like Charley is, 
he wears a green eyeshade and 
rolls his shirtsleeves up above 
his elbows. 

Inside the curve of the copydesk sits the man who directs the 
copyreaders. Since the inside of 
the desk is known as the slot, this 
man is called the slot man. To 
the slot man comes the daily flow 
of news; he passes the copy to 
the men around the desk and 
they edit it and write the headlines. 

Because there is always copy 
enough to fill twenty times the 
allotted space, the copyreader 
must trim all the stories and see 
there is no excess wordage in 
them. This brings him into continuous collision with reporters, 
who see their ornately worded 
stories come out chopped and 
mangled, although definitely 
more readable. 

When work slacks off in the 
afternoon, the copyreaders break 
their silence and talk among 
themselves! They talk about the 
news and debate what can be 
done about it. If you listened to 
them, not knowing who they 



were, you'd swear you were listening in on some world commission ' faced by weighty 
problems on which life or death 
depended. 

For your copyreader is a worrier. He worries because each day 
he handles the fresh and bleeding 
incidents that shape the course of 
human destiny, and there probably is no one who knows more 
surely nor feels more keenly the 
knife-edge balance between survival and disaster. 

CHARLEY PORTER worried 
more than most. He worried 
about a lot of things that didn't 
seem to call for worry. 

There was the matter, for instance, of those "impossible" 
stories happening in sequence. 
The other men on the copydesk 
took notice of them after two or 
three had occurred, and talked 
about them — among themselves, 
naturally, for no proper copyreader ever talks to anyone but 
another copyreader. But they 
passed them off with only casual 
mention. 

Charley worried about the incidents, secretly, of course, since 
he could see that none of his fellow copyreaders felt them worthy 
of really serious worry. After he 
had done a lot of worrying, he 
began to see some similarity 
among them, and that was when 
he really got down on the floor 



WORRY WART

and wrestled with himself. 

First there had been the airliner downed out in Utah. Bad 
weather held up the hunt for it, 
but finally air searchers spotted 
the wreckage strewn over halfa mountain peak. Airline officials 
said there was no hope that any 
had survived. But when the rescuers were halfway to the wreckage, they met the survivors 
walking out; every single soul 
had lived through the crash. 

Then there was the matter of 
Midnight, the 64 to 1 shot, winning the Derby. 

And, after that, the case of 
the little girl who didn't have a 
chance of getting well. They held 
a party for her weeks ahead of 
time so she could have a final 
birthday. Her picture was published coast to coast and the 
stories about her made you want 
to cry and thousands of people 
sent her gifts and postcards. 
Then, suddenly, she got well. Not 
from any new wonder drug or 
from any new medical technique. 
She just got well, some time in 
the night. 

A few days later the wires carried the story about old Pal, the 
coon dog down in Kentucky who 
got trapped inside a cave. Men 
dug for days and yelled encouragement. The old dog whined 
back at them, but finally he 
didn't whine any more and the 
digging was getting mighty hard. 



So the men heaped boulders into 
the hole they'd dug and built a 
cairn. They said pious, angry, 
hopeless words, then went back 
to their cabins and their plowing. 

The next day old Pal came 
home. He was a walking rack of 
bones, but he still could wag 
his tail. The way he went through 
a bowl of milk made a man feel 
good just to see him do it. Everyone agreed that old Pal must 
finally have found a way to get 
out by himself. 

Except that an old dog buried 
in a cave for days, getting weaker 
all the time from lack of food 
and water, doesn't find a way to 
get out by himself. 

And little dying, girls don't get 
well, just like that, in the middle 
of the night. 

And 64 to 1 shots don't win the 
Derby. 

And planes don't shatter themselves among the Utah peaks 
with no one getting hurt at all. 

A miracle, sure. Two miracles, 
even. But not four in a row and 
within a few weeks of one another. 

IT took Charley quite a while 
to establish some line of similarity. When he did, it was a 
fairly thin line. But thick enough, 
at least, to justify more worry. 

The line of similarity was this: 
All the stories were "running" or 
developing stories. 



50 




 



There had been a stretch of 
two days during which the world 
waited for the facts of the plane 
crash. It had been known for 
days bMore the race that Midnight would run and that he 
didn't have a chance. The story of 
the doomed little girl had been 
a matter of public interest for 
weeks. The old coon dog had 
been in the cave a week or more 
before the men gave up and went 
back to their homes. 

In each of the stories, the result was not known until some 
time after the situation itself 
was known. Until the final fact 
was actually determined, there 
existed an infinite number of 
probabilities, some more probable 
than others, but with each prob^ 
ability's having at least a fighting 
chance. When you flip a dime into the air, there always exists 
the infinitesimal probability, 
from the moment you flip it until 
it finally lands heads or tails, 
that it will land on edge and stay 
there. Until the fact that it is 
heads or tails is established, the 
probability of its landing on edge 
continues to remain. 

And that was exactly what had 
happened, Charley told himself: 

The dime had been flipped four 
times, and four times running it 
had stood on edge. 

There was one minor dissimilarity, of course . . . the plane 
crash. It didn't quite fit. 



Each event had been a spin of 
the dime, and while that dime 
was still in air, and the public 
held its breath, a little girl had 
gotten well, somehow, and a dog 
had escaped from a cave, somehow, and a 64 to 1 shot had developed whatever short-lived 
properties bf physique and temperament are necessary to make 
long shots win. 

But the plane crash — there had 
been no thought of it until after 
the fact. By the time the crash 
came into the public eye, the 
dime was down, and what had 
happened on that mountain peak 
had already happened, and all 
the hopes and prayers offered for 
the safety of the passengers were, 
actually, retroactive in the face 
of the enormous probability that 
all had perished. 

Please, let the dog escape. Tonight. 

Let the little girl get well. Soon. 
Let my long shot come in. Next 
week. 

Let the passengers be alive. 
Since yesterday. 

Somehow the plane crash worried Charley most of all. 

rriHEN, to everyone's surprise, 
and with no logic whatsoever, 
the Iranian situation cleared up, 
just when it began to look as if 
it might be another Korea. 

A few days later Britain announced, proudly that it had 



WORRY WART 



51 



weathered its monetary storm, 
that all was well with the sterling 
bloc, and London would need no 
further loans. 

It took a while for Charley to 
tie these two stories up with the 
plane-girl-Derby-hound-dog sequence. But then he saw that 
they belonged and that was when 
he remembered something else 
that might — well, not tie" in, exactly — but might have something 
to do with this extraordinary run 
of impossibilities. 

After work, he went down to 
the Associated Press office and 
had an office boy haul out the 
files, stapled books of carboned 
flimsies — white flimsies for the A 
wire, blue flimsies for the B wire, 
yellow for the sports wire and 
pink for the market wire. He 
knew what he was looking for 
hadn't come over either the market or the sports wire, so he passed them up and went through the 
A and B wire sheets story by 
story. 

He couldn't remember the exact date the story had come over, 
but he knew it had been since 
Memorial Day, so he started 
with the day after Memorial 
Day and worked forward. 

He remembered the incident 
clearly. Jensen, the slot man, had 
picked it up and read it through. 
Then he had laughed and put it 
on the spike. 

One of the others asked: 



"What was funny, Jens?" 

So Jensen took the story off 
the spike and threw it over to 
him. It had gone the rounds of 
the desk, with each man * eading 
it, and finally it had got back on 
the spike again. 

And that had been the last of 
it. For the story was too wacky 
for any newsman to give a second 
glance. It had all the earmarks 
of the phony. 

Charley didn't find what he 
was looking for the first day, although he worked well into the 
evening — so he went back the 
next afternoon, and found it. 

It was out of a little resort 
town up in Wisconsin, and it 
told about an invalid named 
Cooper Jackson who had been 
bedridden since he was two or 
three years old. The story said 
that Cooper's old man claimed 
that Cooper could foresee things, 
that he would think of something 
or imagine something during the 
evening and the next day it 
would happen. Things like Line 
Abrams' driving his car into the 
culvert at Trout Run and coming 
out all right himself, but with the 
car all smashed to . flinders, and 
like the Reverend Amos Tucker's 
getting a letter from a brother he 
hadn't heard from in more than 
twenty years. 

The next day Charley spoke to 
Jensen. 

"I got a few days coming," he 



52 




 



said, "from that time I worked 
six-day weeks last fall, and I 
still got a week of last year's 
vacation you couldn't find the 
room for ..." 

"Sure, Charley," Jensen said. 
"We're in good shape right now." 

rriWO days later Charley stepped off the milk-run train in 
the little resort town in Wisconsin. He went to one of the several 
cabin camps* down on- the lake 
that fronted the town and got 
himself a small, miserable cabin 
for which he paid an exorbitant 
price. And it wasn't until then 
that he dared let himself think — 
really think — of the reason he 
had come there. 

In the evening he went uptown 
and spent an hour or two standing around in the general store 
and the pool room. He came back 
with the information that he had 
set out for, and another piece of 
information he had not been prepared to hear. 

The first piece of information, 
the one he had gone out to get, 
was that Dr. Erik Ames was the 
man to see. Doc Ames, it appeared, was not only the doctor and 
the mayor of the town, but the 
acknowledged civic leader, sage 
and father confessor of the whole 
community. 

The second piece of information, one which had served the 
town as a conversation piece for 



the last two .months, was that 
Cooper Jackson, after years of 
keeping to his bed as a helpless 
invalid, now was » on his feet. He 
had to use a cane, of course, but 
he got around real well and every 
day h% took a walk down by the 
lake. 

They hadn't said what time of 
day, so Charley was up early in 
the morning and started walking up and down the lakeshore, 
keeping a good lookout. He talked with the tourists who occupied 
the other cabins and he talked 
with men who were setting out 
for a day of fishing. He spent 
considerable time observing a 
yellow-winged blackbird that 
had its nest somewhere in a 
bunch of rushes on a marshy spit. 

Cooper Jackson finally came 
early in the afternoon, hobbling 
along on his cane, with a peaked 
look about him. He walked along 
the shore for a ways; then sat 
down to rest on a length of old 
dead tree that had been tossed 
up by a storm. 

Charley ambled over. "Do you 
mind?" he asked, sitting down 
beside him. 

"Not at all," said Cooper Jackson. "I'm glad to have you." 

They talked. Charley told him 
how he was a newspaperman up 
there for a short vacation and 
how it was good to get away from 
the kind of news that came over 
the teletypes, and how he envied 



WORRYWART 



53 



the people who could live in this 
country all the year around. 

When he heard Charley was a 
newspaperman, Cooper's interest 
picked up like a hound dog cocking its ears. He began to ask all 
sorts of questions, the kind of 
questions that everyone asks a 
newspaperman whenever he can 
corner one. 

What do you think of the situation and what can be done 
about it and is there any chance 
of preventing war and what 
should we do to prevent a war . . . 
and so on until you think you'll 
scream. 

Except that it seemed to Charley that Cooper's questions were 
a bit more incisive, backed by a 
bit more information than were 
the questions of the ordinary 
person. He seemed to display 
more insistence and urgency than 
the ordinary person, who always 
asked his questions in a rather 
detached, academic way. 

Charley told him, honestly 
enough, that he didn't know what 
could be done to prevent a war, 
although he said that the quieting 
of the Iranian situation and the 
British monetary announcement 
might go a long way toward 
keeping war from happening. 

"You know," said Cooper 
Jackson, "I felt the same way, 
too. That is, after I read the 
news, I felt that those were two 
good things to happen." 



AT this point, perhaps, a 
couple of things should be 
considered. 

If Charley Porter had been a 
regular newspaperman instead of 
of copyreader, he might have 
mentioned the plane wreck and 
the little girl who hadn't died, 
and how it was a funny thing 
about that coon dog getting out 
of the cave and how he knew of 
a man who'd made a mint of 
money riding in on Midnight. 

But Charley didn't say these 
things. 

If Charley had been a regular 
newspaperman, he might have 
said to Cooper Jackson: "Look 
here, kid, I'm on to you. I know 
what you're doing. I got it figured 
out. Maybe you better straighten 
me out on a point or two, so I'll 
have the story right." 

But Charley didn't say this. 
Instead he said that he had heard 
uptown the night before about 
Cooper's miraculous recovery, 
and he was Cooper Jackson, 
wasn't he? 

Yes, Cooper answered, he was 
Cooper Jackson, and perhaps his 
recovery was miraculous. No, he 
said, he didn't have the least idea 
of how it came about and Doc 
Ames didn't either. 

They parted after an hour or 
two of talk. Charley didn't say 
anything about seeing him again. 
But the next day Cooper came 
limping down to the beach and 



54 




 



headed for the log, and Charley 
was waiting for him. 

That was the day Cooper gave 
Charley his case history. He had 
been an invalid, he said, from as 
far back as he could remember, 
although his mother had told 
him it hadn't happened until he 
was three years old. 

He liked to listen to stories, 
and the stories that his parents 
and his brothers and sisters told, 
him and read to him were what 
had kept him alive, he was certain, during those first years. For 
he made the stories work for him. 

He told how he made the characters^ — Peter Rabbit and the 
Gingerbread Man and Little Bo 
Peep and all the rest of them — 
keep on working overtime after 
he had heard the stories. He 
would lie in bed, he said, and 
relive the stories over and over 
again. 

"But after a while, those stories 
got pretty threadbare. So I improved on them. I invented 
stories. I mixed up the characters. For some reason or other 
Peter Rabbit and the Gingerbread Man always were my 
heroes. They would go on the 
strangest odysseys and meet all 
these other characters, and together they would have adventures that were plain impossible. 

"Except," he added, "they 
never seemed impossible to me." 

Finally he had got to be the 



age where kids usually start off to 
school. Cooper's Ma had begun 
to worry about what they should 
do for his education. But Doc 
Ames, who was fairly sure Cooper wouldn't live long enough for 
an education to do him any good, 
had advised that they teach him 
whatever he might be interested 
in learning. It turned out that 
about all Cooper was interested 
in was reading. So they taught 
him how to read. Now he didn't 
have to have anyone read him 
stories any more, but could read 
them for himself. He read Tom 
Sawyer and Huck Finn and 
Lewis Carroll's works and a lot 
of other books. 

So now he had more characters, and Peter Rabbit had some 
rather horrible moments reconciling his world with the world 
of Tweedledum and Tweedledee 
and the Mock Turtle. But he 
finally worked in, and the imagined adventuring got crazier 
and crazier. 

"It's a wonder," said Cooper 
Jackson, "that I didn't die laughing. But to me it wasn't funny. 
It was dead serious." 

"What do you read now, Cooper?" Charley asked. 

"Oh, the newspapers," Cooper 
said, "and the news magazines 
and stuff like that." 

"That's not what I mean," 
Charley explained. "What do you 
read for relaxation? What takes 



WORRYW ART 



55 



the place of Peter Rabbit?" 

Cooper hemmed and hawed a 
little and finally he admitted it. 

"I read science fiction. I ran 
onto it when someone brought 
me a magazine six or seven years 
ago ... no, I guess it's more like 
eight." 

"I read the stuff myself," said 
Charley, to put him at his ease. 

So they sat the rest of the 
afternoon and talked of science 
fiction. 

rpHAT night Charley Porter lay 
-*• in his bed in the little lakeshore cabin, staring into the darkness, trying to understand how 
it must have been for Cooper 
Jackson, lying there all those 
years, living with the characters 
out of children's books and later 
out of boys' books and then out 
of science fiction. 

He had said that he'd never 
been in much pain, but sometimes the nights were long and 
it was hard to sleep, and that was 
how he'd got started with his imagining. He would imagine things 
to occupy his mind. 

At first, it was just a mental 
exercise, saying such and such 
a thing is happening now and 
going on from there to some 
other thing that was happening. 
But after a while he began to 
see an actual set of characters 
acting on an imaginary stage, 
faint and fuzzy characters going 



through their parts. They were 
nebulous at first; later on, they 
became gray, like little skipping 
ghosts; then they had achieved 
the sharpness of black and white. 
About the time he began to deal 
with Tom Sawyer and Robinson 
Crusoe, the characters and backgrounds had begun to take on 
color and perspective. 

And from Huck Finn and Robinson Crusoe and Swiss Family 
Robinson, he had gone on to science fiction. 

Good Lord, thought Charley 
Porter. He went on to science 
fiction. 

Take an invalid who had never 
moved out of his bed, who had 
never had a formal education, 
who knew little and cared less 
about the human viewpoint, give 
him an overwrought imagination 
and turn him loose on science 
fiction — and what have you got? 

Charley lay there in the darkness and tried to put himself into the place of Cooper Jackson. 
He tried to imagine what Cooper 
might have imagined, what far 
adventuring he might have embarked upon. 

Then let the same invalid suddenly become aware of the world 
around him, as Cooper had — for 
now he read the newspapers and 
the news magazines. Let him see 
what kind of shape the world 
was in. 

What might happen then? 



56 




 



You're crazy, Charley told 
himself. But he lay for a long 
time, looking up into the black, 
before he went to sleep. 

^OOPER seemed to like him, 
^ and they spent a part of each 
day together. They talked about 
science fiction and the news of 
the day and what should be done 
to ensure world peace. Charley 
told him he didn't know what 
should be done, that a lot of 
men much smarter than he were 
working full time on it, and they 
had found no answer yet. 

"Someone," said Cooper, "must 
do something about it." And the 
way he said it, you would have 
sworn that he was going to set 
out any minute to do that very 
thing. 

So Charley went to call on old 
Doc Ames. 

"I've heard of you," the doctor told him. "Coop was telling 
me about you just the other 
day." 

"I've been spending a little 
time with Cooper," Charley said, 
"and I've wanted to ask him 
something, but I haven't done 
it." 

"I know. You wanted to ask 
him about the story that was in 
the papers here a few months 
back." 

"That's right," Charley agreed. 
"And I wanted to ask him, too, 
about how he got up and walked 



after all those years in bed." 

"You're looking for a story?" 
asked the doctor. 

"No," said Charley, "I'm not 
looking for a story." 

"You're a newspaperman." 

"I came for a story," Charley 
told him. "But not any more. 
Right now I'm . . . well, I'm sort 
of scared." 

"So am I." 

"If what I'm thinking is right, 
it's too big to be a story." 

"I hope," said Doc, "that both 
of us are wrong." 

"He's hell bent," Charley went 
on, "to bring peace to the world. 
He's asked me about it a dozen 
times in a dozen different ways. 
I've told him I don't know, and 
I don't think there's anyone who 
does." 

"That's the trouble. If he'd just 
stick to things like that lost plane 
out in Utah and the hound dog 
down in Kentucky, it might be 
all right." 

"Did he tell you about those 
things, Doc?" 

"No," said Doc, "he didn't 
really tell me. But he said 
wouldn't it be fine if all those 
people in the plane should be 
found alive, and he did a lot of 
fretting about that poor trapped 
dog. He likes animals." 

"I figure he just practiced up 
on a few small items," Charley 
suggested, "to find if he could 
do it. He's out for big game now."

57 



Then good, solid, common 
sense came back to him and he 
said : "But, of course, it isn't possible." 

"He's got help," said Doc. 
"Hasn't he told you about the 
help he's got?" 

Charley shook his head. 

"He doesn't know you well 
enough. I'm the only one he 
knows well enough to tell a thing 
like that." 

"He's got help? You mean 
someone's helping . . . ?" 

"Not someone," said Doc. 
"Something." 




IHEN Doc told Charley what 
Cooper had told him. 



It had started four or five years 
before, shortly after he'd gone on 
his science fiction binge. He'd 
built himself an imaginary ship 
that he took out into space. First 
he'd traveled around our own 
Solar System — to Mars and 
Venus and all the others. Then, 
tiring of such backyard stuff, he 
had built iri a gadget that gave 
his ship speed in excess of light 
and had gone out to the stars. 
He was systematic about it; you 
had to say that much for him. 
He worked things out logically, 
and he didn't skip around. He'd 
land on a certain planet and give 
that planet the full treatment before he went on to the next one. 

Somewhere along the way, he 
picked himself up a crew of com


panions, most of which were only 
faintly humanoid, if at all. 

And all the time this spaceworld, this star-world, got clearer 
and sharper and more real. It 
almost got to the point where he 
lived in its reality rather than in 
the reality of the here and now. 

The realization that someone 
else had joined him, that he had 
picked up from somewhere a collaborator in his fantasies, began 
first as a suspicion, finally solidified into certainty. The fantasies 
got into the habit of not going as 
he himself was imagining them; 
they were modified, and added 
to, and changed in other ways. 
Cooper didn't mind though, for 
generally they were better than 
anything he could think up by t 
himself — and finally he had | 
grown to know his collaborators l 
— not one of them alone, but 
three of them, each a separate entity. After the first shocks of recognition, the four them got along 
just swell. 

"You mean he knows these 
others — these helpers?" 

"He knows them all right," said 
Doc. "Which doesn't mean, of 
course, that he has ever seen 
them or will ever see them." 

"You believe this, Doc?" 

"I don't know. I don't know. 
But I do know Coop, and I know 
that he got up and walked. There 
is no medical science ... no human medical science . . . that 



58 




 



would have made him walk." 

"You think these helpers, these 
collaborators of his, might somehow have cured him?" 

"Something did." 

"One thing haunts me," said 
Charley. "Is Cooper Jackson 
sane?" * 

"Probably," answered Doc, 
"he's the sanest man on Earth." 

"And the most dangerous." 

"That's what worries me. I 
watch him the best I can. I see 
him every day . . ." 

"How many others have you 
told?" asked Charley. 

"Not a soul," said Doc. 

"How many are you going to 
tell?" 

"None. Probably I shouldn't 
have told you, but you already 
knew part of it. What are you 
going to do?" 

"I'm going home," said Charley. "I'm going to go home and 
keep my mouth shut." 

"Nothing else?" 

"Nothing else. If I were a praying man, I think I'd do some 
praying." 

HE went home and kept his 
mouth shut and did a lot of 
worrying. He wondered whether, 
praying man or not, he shouldn't 
try a prayer or two. But when 
he did, the prayers sounded 
strange and out of place coming 
from his lips, so he figured he'd 
better leave well enough atone. 



At times it still seemed impossible. At other times it seemed 
crystal clear that Cooper Jack- . 
son actually could will an event 
to happen — that by thinking so, 
he could make it so. But mostly, 
because he knew too much to 
think otherwise, Charley knew 
that the whole thing was true. 
Cooper Jackson had spent twenty 
years or so in thinking and imagining, his thoughts and imaginings shaped, not by the course of 
human events, but by the fantasy of many human minds. He 
would not think as a normal human being thought, and therein 
lay both an advantage and a danger. 

If he did not think in entirely 
human channels, he also was not 
trammeled by the limitations of 
human thinking; he was free to 
let his mind wander out in strange 
directions and bend its energies 
to strange tasks. His obsession 
with the necessity of achieving 
lasting peace was an example of 
his unhuman attitude; for, while 
the entire Earth did earnest lip 
service to the cause of peace, the 
threat of war had hung over every 
one so long that its horror had 
been dulled. But to Cooper Jackson, it was unthinkable that men 
should slay one another by the 
millions. 

Always Charley came back to 
those helpers, those three shadowy figures he pictured as stand

ing at Cooper Jackson's shoulder. 
He assigned them three arbitrary 
faces, but the faces would not 
stay as he imagined them. At last 
he understood that, they were 
things to which you could assign 
no face. 

But the thing that he still worried most about, although he tried 
not to think of it at all because 
of its enormity, was the Utah 
plane crash. 

The plane had crashed before 
Cooper, or anyone else, could 
have known it was about to crash. 
Whatever had happened to the 
people in the plane had happened 
then, in that one split second 
when plane and peak had touched 
— had happened without benefit 
of the magic of Cooper Jackson's 
wishful thinking. And to imagine 
that, without such benefit, the 
passengers and crew could have 
escaped unscathed was nothing 
short of madness. It just couldn't 
have happened that way. 

And that meant that Cooper 
not only could make something 
turn out the way he wanted it to 
turn out, but that he also could 
go back through time and undo 
something that was already done! 
Either that, or he could bringdead people back to life, reassembling their shattered bodies 
and making them whole again, 
and that was even madder than 
to think that his wishful thinking 
might be retroactive. 



WHENEVER Charley thought 
about that, the sweat would 
start out on him and he'd think 
about Britain and Iran and once 
again he would see Cooper's face, 
>all puckered up with worry about 
what the world was coming to. 

He watched the news more 
closely than he had ever watched 
it, analyzing each unexpected 
turn in it, searching for the clue 
that might suggest some harebrained scheme to Cooper Jackson, trying to think the way 
Cooper might think, but feeling 
fairly sure that he wasn't even 
coming close. 

He had his bags packed twice 
to go to Washington — but each 
time he unpacked them and put 
away his clothes and shoved the 
bags back into the closet. 

For he realized there was no 
use going to Washington, or anywhere else for that matter. 

"Mr. President, I know a man 
who can bring peace to the 
world . . ." 

They'd throw him out before 
he had the sentence finished. 

He called Doc Ames, and Doc 
told him that everything was all 
right, that Cooper had bought a 
lot of back-issue science fiction 
magazines and was going through 
them, cataloguing story themes 
and variant ideas. He seemed 
happy in this pastime and calmer 
than he'd been for weeks. 

When Charley hung up, he

found that his hands were shaking and he suddenly was cold 
all over, for he felt positive that 
he knew what Cooper was doing 
with those piles of magazines. 

He sat in the one comfortable 
chair in his rented room and 
thought furiously, turning over 
and over the plots that he had 
run across in his science fiction 
reading. While there were some 
that might apply, he rejected 
them because they didn't fit into 
the pattern of his fear. 

It wasri't until then that he realized he'd been so busy worrying about Cooper that he hadn't 
been paying attention to the recent magazines. Cold fear gripped him that there might be 
something in the current issues 
that might apply most neatly. 

He'd have to buy all the magazines he could find, and give them 
a good, fast check. 

T>UT he got busy at one thing 
and another and it was almost a week before he got around 
to buying them. By that time 
his fear had subsided to some extent. Trudging home with the 
magazines clutched beneath his 
arm, he decided that he would 
put aside his worry for one night 
at least and read for enjoyment. 

That evening he settled himself in the comfortable chair and 
stacked the magazines beside 
him. He took the first one off 



the top of the stack and opened 
it, noting with some pleasure that 
the lead-off story was by a favorite author. 

It was a grim affair about an 
Earthman holding an outpost 
against terrific odds. He read the 
next one . . . about a starship that 
hit a space warp and got hurled 
into another universe. 

The third was about the Earth 
being threatened by a terrible war 
and how the hero solved the crisis 
by bringing about a condition 
which outlawed electricity, making it impossible in the Universe. Without electricity, planes 
couldn't fly and tanks couldn't 
move and guns couldn't be sighted in, so there was no war. 

Charley sat in the chair like 
a stricken man. The magazine 
dropped from his fingers to the 
floor and he stared across the 
room at the opposite wall with 
terror in his eyes, knowing that 
Cooper Jackson would have read 
that story too. 

After a while Charley got up 
and telephoned Doc. 

"I'm worried, Charley," Doc 
told him. "Coop has disappeared." 

"Disappeared!" 

"We've tried to keep it quiet. 
Didn't want to stir up any fuss 
— the way Coop is and all. There 
might be too many questions." 

"You're looking for him?" 

"We're looking for him," Doc

said, "as quietly as we can. We've 
scoured the countryside and we've 
sent out wires to police officials 
and missing persons bureaus." 

"You've got to find him, Doc!" 

"We're doing all we can." Doc 
sounded tired and a bit bewildered. 

"But where could he have 
gone?" asked Charley. "He 
doesn't have any money, does 
he? He can't stay hiding out too 
long without . . ." 

"Coop can get money any time 
he wants it. He can get anything 
he wants any time he wants it." 

"I see what you mean," said 
Charley. 

"I'll keep in touch," said Doc. 

"Is there anything . . . ?" 

"Not a thing," said Doc. "Not 
a thing that anyone can do. We 
can wait. That's all." 




MAT was months ago, and 
Charley is still waiting. 



Cooper's still missing and 
there's no trace of him. 

So Charley waits and worries. 

And the thing he worries about 
is Cooper's lack of a formal education, his utter lack of certain 



basic common knowledge. 

There is one hope, of course — 
that Cooper, if and when he decides to act, will make his action 
retroactive, going back in time to 
outlaw not electricity itself, but 
Man's discovery of electricity. 
For, disrupting and terrible as 
that might be, it would be better than the other way. 

But Charley's afraid that 
Cooper won't see the necessity 
for retroactive action. He's afraid 
that Cooper won't realize that, 
when you outlaw electricity, you 
can't limit it to the current that 
runs through a wire to light a 
lamp or turn an engine. When 
you rule out electricity as a natural phenomenon, you rule out 
all electricity, and that means you 
rule out an integral part of atomic 
structure. And that you affect 
not only this Earth but the entire Universe. 

So Charley sits and worries and 
waits for the nicker of the lamp 
beside his chair. 

Although he realizes, of course, 
that when it comes there won't 
be any flicker.
