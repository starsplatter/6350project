PROBLEM ON BALAK By ROGER DEE 

WHAT I'm getting at is 
that you don't ever have 
to worry about being 
bored stiff in Solar Exploitations 
field work. It never gets dull — 
and in some pretty strange places, 
at that. 

Take the S.E.2100's discovery 
of Balak, which is a little planet 
circling 70 Ophiuchi some 20,000 
light-years from Earth, for example. You'd never expect to run 
across the greatest race of surgeons in the Galaxy — structural, 
neural or what have you — on a 



little apple like that, any more 
than you'd expect a four man 
complement like ours to be handed the sort of life-and-death 
problem they put to us. 

And, if by some miracle of 
prophecy you anticipated both, 
it's a cirich you'd never expect 
that problem to be solved in the 
way ours was. 

CAPTAIN Corelli and Gibbons 
and I couldn't have gone more 
than a hundred yards from the 
S.E.2100 before we met our first 



PROBLEM ON BALAK

Balakian native. Or, to be more 
accurate, before he met us. 

Corelli and I were filling our 
little sterilized bottles with samples of soil and vegetation and 
keeping a wary eye out for possible predators when it happened. 
Gibbons, our ecologist and the 
scientific mainspring of our crew, 
was watching a swarm of little 
twelve-legged bugs that were 
busily pollinating a dwarf shrub 
at the top and collecting payment 
in drops of white sap that oozed 
out at the bottom in return. His 
eyes were shining behind their 
spectacles, and he was swearing 
to himself in a pleased monotone. 

"Signal the ship and tell the 
Quack — if you can pry that hypochondriac idiot away from his 
gargles and germicide sprays — 
to bring out a live-specimen container," he called to Captain 
Corelli. "We've stumbled onto 
something really new here, a conscious symbiosis between entirely 
dissimilar life-forms! If the rest 
of the flora and fauna cooperate 
like this . . ." 

At the moment, Gibbons' discovery didn't register, because it 
was just then that the first Balakian showed himself. 

The native looked at first 
glance something like a wrinkled 
pink octopus, standing three feet 
high and nearly as broad, and 
he walked in a skip-a-step swing 
like a man on crutches because 




his three short legs were set in 
a horizontal row. He had four 
arms to each side, the lower ones 
meant for grasping and holding 
and the upper ones for manipulation. He didn't have a head, exactly, but there was a face of 
sorts up near the top of the body 
that looked like nothing so much 
as a politely grinning Oriental's. 

He wasn't armed, but I took no 
chances — I dropped my specimen 
kit and yanked out the heat-gun 
that is a part of every S.E. field 
operative's gear. Captain Corelli, 
who was on the point of calling 
the Quack at the ship, took his 



74 i 




 




thumb off the mike button and 
grabbed for his own weapon. Gibbons, like a true scientist, stood 
by with his mouth open, too interested to be scared. 

Then the Balakian spoke, and 
Corelli and I gaped wider than 
Gibbons. As I said before, Balak 
is some 20,000 light-years from 
Earth, and to our knowledge we 
were the first human beings ever 
to come within a hundred parsecs 
of the place. 

"Please don't shoot, gentlemen," he said to us in Terran. 
"My name is Gaff a, and I assure 
you that I am quite friendly." 

PROBLEM ON BALAK 



T HAD to give Gibbons credit 
■■- for being fast on his mental 
feet; he had taken over before 
Corelli and I could get our 
mouths closed, and was talking to 
the native as if this sort of thing 
happened every time we made 
planetfall. 

"You speak Terran fluently," 
Gibbons said. "Or is this some 
sort of telepathic contact that 
creates the illusion of oral communication?" 

The native grinned delightedly. 
"The contact is oral. We learned 
your language from an independent planet-hunter named Haslop, 

75 



who was wrecked here some years 
ago." 

In Solar Exploitations you learn 
to expect the unexpected, but to 
me this was stretching coincidence clear out of joint. We had 
the latest zero-interval-transference drive made, and I couldn't 
believe that any independent 
planet-staker could have beaten 
us here with outmoded equipment. 

"A Terran?" I asked. "Where 
is he now?" 

"Coming up," Gaff a said. "With 
my fellows." 

A couple of dozen other Balakians, looking exactly like him, 
bore down on us through the 
dwarf shrubbery, and with them 
were two lanky Terrans dressed 
in loose shirt-and-drawers ensembles which obviously had been 
made on Balak. Even at a distance the Terrans looked disturbingly alike, and when they got 
closer I could see that they were 
identical twins. 

"You don't count so good, 
chum," J said. "I see two Terrans." 

"Only one," Gaffa corrected, 
grinning wider. "The other is one 
of us." 

I didn't believe it, of course. 
Corelli didn't get it, either; his 
eyes had a glazed look, and he 
was shaking his head like a man 
with a gnat in his ear. 

One of the Terrans rushed up 



to us with tears in his eyes and 
his Adam's apple bobbing, so 
overcome with emotion that I 
was afraid he might kiss us. 

"I'm Ira Haslop," he said in a 
choked voice. "I've been marooned here for twenty-two 
eternal years, and I never thought 
I'd see a Terran face again. And 
now — " 

He stopped, but not for breath. 
The other skinny Terran had 
grabbed his arm and swung him 
around. 

"What the hell do you think 
you're doing, you masquerading 
nightmare?" the second one 
yelled. "I'm Ira Haslop, and you 
damn well know it! If you think 
you're going to pass yourself off 
as me and go home to Earth in 
my place ..." 

The first Haslop gaped at him 
for a moment; then he slapped 
the other's hand off his arm and 
shook a bony fist in his face. 

"So that's your game! That's 
why these grinning freaks made 
you look like me and threw us 
together all these years — they've 
planned all along to ring in a 
switch and send you home instead 
of me! Well, it won't work!" 

rriHE second Haslop swung on 
him then and the two of them 
went to the mat like a pair of 
loose-drawered tigers, cursing and 
gouging. The grinning natives 
separated them after a moment

and examined them carefully for 
damage, chattering away with 
great satisfaction in their own 
language. 

Corelli and Gibbons and I 
stared at each other like three 
fools. It was impossible to think 
that either of the two men could 
be anything but what he claimed 
to be, a perfectly normal and 
thoroughly angry Terran; but 
when each of them swore that 
one of them — the other one, of 
course — was an alien, and the natives backed up the accusation, 
what else could we believe? 

Gaffa, who seemed to be a sort 

of headman, took over and explained the situation — which 
seemed to be an incredibly longrange gag cooked up by these 
octopod jokers, without the original Haslop's knowledge, against 
the day when another Terran ship 
might land on Balak. Their real 
intent, Gaffa said, was to present 
us with a problem that could be 
solved only by a species with a 
real understanding of its own 
kind. If we could solve it, his 
people stood ready to assist us in 
any way possible. If not . . . 

I didn't like the sound of it, so 
I reached for my heat-gun again. 
So did Captain Corelli and Gibbons, but we were too slow. 

A little stinging bug — another 
link in the cooperative Balakian 
ecology — bit each of us on the 
back of the neck and we passed 



out cold. When we woke up again, 
we were "guests" of Gaffa and his 
tribe in a sort of settlement miles 
from the S.E.2100, and there 
wasn't so much as a nail file 
among us in the way of weapons. 

The natives hadn't bothered to 
shackle us or lock us up. We 
found ourselves lying instead in 
the middle of a circular court 
surrounded by mossy mounds 
that looked like flattened beehives, but which were actually 
dwellings where the Balakians 
lived. 

We learned later that the buildings were constructed by swarms 
of tiny burrowing brutes like 
termites, who built them up grain 
by grain according to specifications. I can't begin to explain the 
principle behind the harmony existing between all living things on 
Balak; it just was, and seemed to 
operate like a sort of hypersympathy or interlocking telepathy between species. Every 
creature on the planet performed 
some service for some other creature — even the plants, which grew 
edibles without pain-nerves so it 
wouldn't hurt to be plucked, and 
which sent up clouds of dust-dry 
spores once a week to make it 
rain. 

And the three-legged, eightarmed natives were right at the 
top of this screwy utopia, lords 
of it all. 

Not that any of us were inter

ested at first in it as an geological 
marvel, of course. From the moment we woke up we were too 
busy with plans for escaping the 
trap we'd fallen into. 

CfHPHE Quack is our only 
•■- hope," Captain Corelli said, 
and groaned at the thought. "If 
that hypochondriac idiot has 
brains enough to sit tight, we may 
have a chance. If they get him, 
too, we're lost." 

The Quack was a damned poor 
reed to lean on. 

His name was Alvin Frick, but 
no one ever used it. He was 
twenty-nine, and would never 
have rated a space berth as anything but a hydroponics attendant, which is one step above 
manual labor. He was short, 
plump and scrubbed to the pink, 
and he was the only hypochondriac I ever knew in this modern age 
of almost no sickness. He groused about the germs swarming in 
his reduction tanks, and he was 
scared green, in spite of his permanent immunization shots, that 
he'd contract some nameless alien 
disease at every planetfall. He 
dosed himself continuously with 
concoctions whipped up from an 
old medical book he had found 
somewhere, and he spent most of 
his off-duty time spraying himself 
and his quarters with disinfectant. 
His mania had only one good 
facet — if he had been the care


less sort, hydroponics being what 
it is, he'd have smelled like a 
barnyard instead of a dispensary. 

We had never made any attempt to get rid of him, since we 
might have drawn an even worse 
tank-farmer, but we began to wish 
now that we had. We had hardly 
begun to figure ways and means 
of escaping when a bunch of grinning natives swung into our court 
and deposited the Quack, sleeping soundly, in our midst. 

He came to just before sundown, and when we told him 
what had happened, he promptly 
passed out again — this time from 
fright. 

"A fine lot of help you are, you 
super-sterile slob," I said when he 
woke up for the second time. I'd 
probably have said worse, but it 
was just then that the real squeeze 
began. 

Gaff a came back with the two 
scowling Haslops in tow and 
handed us the problem his tribe 
had spent twenty-two years in 
working up. 

"We have learned enough already from Haslop," Gaffa said, 
"to know something of the pressures and complexities that follow the expansion of your Terran 
Realm through the galaxy, and to 
assure us that in time we must 
either become a part of that 
Realm or isolate ourselves completely. 

"We are a peaceful species and

feel that we should probably 
benefit as much from your physical sciences as your people would 
from our biological skills, but 
there is a question of compatibility that must be settled first, 
before we may risk making ourselves known to Terra. So we 
have devised a test to' determine 
what our course shall be." 

WE raised our brows at one 
another over that, not guessing at the time just what the 
Balakians really had on the ball. 

"For thousands of generations, 
we have devoted our energies to 
knowing ourselves and our environment," Gaff a said, "because 
we know that no species can be 
truly balanced unless it understands itself. The symbiosis between all life-forms on our planet 
is the result of that knowledge. 
We should like to assure ourselves that you are capable of 
understanding your own kind as 
well before we offer our services 
to your Terran Realm — and 
therein lies the test we have arranged for you." 

Captain Corelli drew himself 
up stiffly. "I think," he said, "that 
the three of us should be able to 
unravel your little riddle, if you'll 
condescend to tell us what it is." 

Gaff a sent a puzzled look at 
the Quack, and I could see that 
he was wondering why Corelli 
hadn't included him in the boast. 



But Gaff a didn't know how simple the Quack could be, nor how 
preoccupied with his own physiology he was. 

"One of these two," said Gaffa, ' 
pointing to the two Haslops, "is 
the original Ira Haslop, who was 
stranded here twenty-two Terran 
years ago. The other is a synthetic creation of ours — an android, if you like, who is identical, 
cell by cell, with the original so 
far as exterior likeness is concerned. We could not duplicate 
the interior- without dissection, 
which of course was out of the 
question, so we were forced to 
make compromises that — " 

Gibbons interrupted him incredulously. ^"You mean you've 
created a living creature, brain 
and all?" 

"Only the body," Gaffa said. 
"Creation of intelligence is still 
beyond us. The brain of the 
duplicate Haslop is one of our 
own, transplanted and conditioned to Haslop's knowledge, 
memories and ideology." 

He paused for a moment, and 
the waiting circle of Balakians 
grinned with him in anticipation. 

"Your problem is this," Gaffa 
said. "If you know yourselves 
well enough to merit our help, 
then you should be able to distinguish readily between the real 
and false Haslops. If you fail, we 
shall have no alternative but to 
keep you here on Balak for the 



PROBLEM ON BALAK 



79 



rest of your lives, since to release 
you would bring other Terrans 
down on us in force." 

And that was it. All we had to 
do was to take these two identical 
twins — who looked alike, thought 
alike and cursed alike — and deterniine which was real and which 
was bogus. 

"For a very pertinent reason 
which you may or may not discover," Gaff a said, "the test must 
be limited to a few hours. You 
have until sunrise tomorrow 
morning, gentlemen." 

And with that he crutched away 
at his skip-a-step walk, taking 
his grinning cohorts with him. 
The two Haslops remained behind, glowering and grumbling at 
each other. 




HE situation didn't look too 
bad at first. 



"There are no two things," 
Captain Corelli declared, "that 
are exactly and absolutely identical. And that applies, I should 
say, especially to identities." 

It had a heartening sound. I've 
never been long on logic, being a 
very ordinary S.E. navigator 
whose automatic equipment is 
designed to do practically everything for him, and Corelli seemed 
to know what he was talking 
about. 

Gibbons, being a scientist, saw 
it differently. 

"That's not even good sophis


try," he said. "The concept of 
identity between two objects has 
no meaning whatever, Captain, 
unless we have a prior identification of one or the other. Aristotle 
himself couldn't have told an 
apple from a coconut if he'd 
never seen or heard of either." 

"Any fool would know that," 
one of the Haslops grunted. And 
the other added in the same tone : 
"Hey, if you guys are going at it 
like that, we'll be here forever!" 

"All right," Corelli said, deflated. "We'll try another tack." 

He thought for a minute or 
two. "How about screening them 
for background detail? The real 
Haslop was a bounty-claimer, 
which means that he must have 
made thousands of planetfalls before crashing here. The bogus one 
couldn't remember the details of 
all those worlds as well as the \ 
original, no matter how many 
times he'd been told, could he?" ; 

"Won't work," one of the Haslops said disgustedly. "Hell, after 
twenty-two years I can't remember those places myself, and I 
was there." 

The other Haslop gave him a j 
dirty look. "You were here, fellow — / was there." 

And to the captain he said, 
"We're getting nowhere, friend. < 
You're underestimating these 
Balakians — they look and act like 
screwballs, but they're sharp. In 
the twenty-two years I've lived 



80 




 



with that carbon copy of myself, 
he's learned everything I know." 

"He's right," Gibbons put in. 
He blinked a couple of times and 
turned pink. "Unless the real 
Haslop happened to be married, 
that is. I'm a bachelor myself, but 
I'd say there are some memories 
that a married man wouldn't discuss, even when marooned." 

Captain Corelli stared at him 
admiringly. "I never gave you 
enough credit, Gibbons," he said. 
"You're right! How about—" 

"Don't help any," one of the 
Haslops said morosely. "I never 
was married. And now I never 
will be if I've got to depend on 
you jerks to get me out of this 
mess." 

The sun went down just then 
and a soft, drowsy darkness fell. 
I thought at first that we'd have 
to finish our investigation in the 
dark, but the natives had made 
provisions for that. A swarm of 
fireflies as big as robins sailed in 
from somewhere and circled 
around over the court, lighting it 
as bright as day. The Balakian 
houses made a dim row of flattened shadow-mounds at the outskirts of the circle. A ring of 
natives sat tailor -fashion on the 
ground in front of them — a neat 
trick considering that they had 
three legs each to fold up — and 
grinned at us. 

They had waited twenty-two 
years for this show, and now that 



it had come they were enjoying 
every minute of it. 

OUR investigation was pretty 
rough going. The fireflies 
overhead all circled in one direction, which made you dizzy every 
time you looked up, and besides 
that the Quack had remembered 
that he was a prisoner in an 
alien environment and was at the 
mercy of any outlandish disease 
that might creep past his permanent immunization. He muttered 
and grumbled to himself about 
the risk, and his grousing got on 
our nerves even worse than usual. 

I moved over to shut him up, 
and blinked when I saw him pop 
something into his mouth. My 
first guess was that he had managed to sneak some food concentrate out of the ship somehow, 
and the thought made me realize 
how hungry I was. 

"What've you got there, 
Quack?" I demanded. "Come on, 
give — what are you hiding out?" 

"Antibiotics and stuff," he answered, and pulled a little flat 
plastic case out of a pocket. 

It was his portable medicine" 
chest, which he carried the way 
superstitious people used to carry 
rabbits' feet, and it was largely 
responsible for our calling him 
the Quack. It was full of patent 
capsule remedies that he had 
gleaned out of his home medical 
book — a cut thumb, a surprise 



PROBLEM ON BALAK 



81 



headache, or a siege of gas on the 
stomach would never catch the 
Quack unprepared! 

"Jerk," I said, and went back 
to Gibbons and Corelli, who were 
arguing a new approach to our 
problem. 

"It's worth a try," Gibbons 
said. He turned on the two Haslops, who were bristling like a pair 
of strange dogs. "This question is 
for the real Haslop: Have you 
ever been put through a Rorschach, thematic apperception or 
free association test?" 

The real Haslop hadn't. Either 
of them. 

"Then we'll try free association," Gibbons said, and explained 
what he wanted of them. 

"Water," Gibbons said, popping it out quick and sharp. 

"Spigot," the Haslops said together. Which is exactly what any 
spaceman would say, since the 
only water important to him 
comes out of a ship's tank. "Lake" 
and "river" and "spring," to him, 
are only words in books. 

Gibbons chewed his lip and 
tried again, but the result was 
the same every time. When he 
said "payday" they both came 
back "binge," and when he said 
"man" they answered "woman!" 
with the same gleam in their eyes. 

"I could have told you it 
wouldn't work," one Haslop said 
when Gibbons threw up his hands 
and quit. "I've lived so long with 



that phony that he even knows 
what I'm going to say next." 

"I was -going to say the same 
thing," the other one growled. 
"After twenty-two years of drinking and arguing with him, we've 
begun — God help me! — to think 
alike." 

I tried my own hand just once. 

"Gaff a says that they are exactly identical so far as outside 
appearance goes," I said. "But 
he may be wrong, or lying. Maybe we'd better check for our T 
selves." 

npHE Haslops raised a howl, of 
-■- course, but it did them no 
good. Gibbons and Corelli and I 
ganged them one at a time — the 
Quack refused to help for fear of 
being contaminated — and examined them carefully. It was a 
lively job, since both of them 
swore they were ticklish, and under different circumstances it 
could have been embarrassing. 

But it settled one point. Gaff a 
hadn't lied. They were absolutely 
identical, as far as we could determine. 

We had given it up and were 
resting from our labors when 
Gaff a came grinning out of the 
darkness and brought us a big 
crystal pitcher of something that 
would have passed for a firstclass Planet Punch except that 
it was nearer two-thirds alcohol 
than the fifty-fifty mix you get at 



82 




 



most interplanetary ginmills. 

The two Haslops had a slug of 
it as a matter of course, being 
accustomed to it, and the rest of 
us followed suit. Only the Quack 
refused, turning green at the 
thought of all the alien bacteria 
that might be swimming around 
in the pitcher. 

A couple of drinks made us 
feel better. 

"I've been thinking," Captain 
Corelli said, "about what Gaffa 
said when he limited the time of 
the test, that we might or might 
not discover the reason for ourselves. Now what the hell did the 
grinning heathen mean by that? 
Is there a reason, or was he only 
dragging a red herring across the 
bogus Haslop's track?" 

Gibbons looked thoughtful. I 
sat back while he pondered and 
watched the Quack, who was 
swallowing another antibiotic capsule. 

"Wait a minute," Gibbons exclaimed. "Captain, you've hit on 
something there!" 

He stared at the Haslops. They 
stared back, unimpressed. 

"Gaffa said you two were exactly alike outside," Gibbons said. 
"And we've proved it. Does that 
mean you're not alike inside?" 

"Sure," one of them said. "But 
what of it? You're sure as hell 
not going to cut one of us open 
to see!" 

"You're confusing the issue," 



Gibbons snapped. "What I'm getting at is this — if you two aren't 
made alike inside, then you can't 
possibly exist on the same sort 
of diet. One of you eats the same 
sort of food as ourselves. The 
other can't. But which is which?" 

One of the Haslops pointed a 
quivering finger at the other. "It's 
him!" he said. "I've watched him 
drink his dinner for twenty-two 
years — he's the fake!" 

"Liar!" the other one yelled, 
springing up. Corelli stepped between them and the second Haslop subsided, grumbling. "It's true 
enough, only he's the one that 
drinks his meals. This stuff in the 
pitcher is the food he lives on — 
alcohol for energy, with minerals 
and other stuff dissolved in it. I 
drink it with him for kicks, but 
that phony can't eat anything 
else." 

CORELLI snapped his fingers. 
"So that's why they limited 
our time, and why they brought 
this stuff — to keep their fake Haslop refueled! All we've got to do to 
separate our men now is feed them 
something solid. The one that eats 
it is the real Haslop." 

"Sure, all we need now is some 
solid food," I said. "You don't 
happen to have a couple of sandwiches on you, do you?" 

Everybody got quiet for a couple of minutes, and in the silence 
the Quack surprised us all by

deciding to speak up. 

"Since I'm stuck here for life," 
he said, "a few germs more or 
less won't matter much. Pass me 
the pitcher, will you?" 

He took a man-sized slug of 
the fiery stuff without even wiping off the pitcher's rim. 

After that we gave it up, as 
who wouldn't have? Captain Corelli said the hell with it and 
took such a slug out of the 
pitcher that the two Haslops 
yelled murder and grabbed it 
quick themselves, and from then 
on we just sat around and drank 
and talked and waited for the 
sunrise that would condemn us to 
Balak for the rest of our lives. 

Thinking about our problem 
had reminded me of an old puzzle I'd heard somewhere about 
three men being placed in a room 
where they can see each other 
but not themselves; they're shown 
three white hats and two black 
ones, and then they're blindfolded and a hat is put on each of 
their heads. When the blindfolds 
are, taken off, the third man knows 
by looking at the other two and 
by what they say just what color 
hat he's wearing himself, but I 
always forget how it is that he 
knows. 

We got so interested in the 
hat problem that the east was 
turning pink before we realized it. 

None of us actually saw the 
sun rise, though, except the 



Quack and the bogus Haslop. 

I was right in the middle of a 
sentence when all of a sudden my 
stomach rolled over and growled 
like a dying tiger, and I never 
had such an all-gone feeling in 
my life. I looked at the others, 
wondering if the stuff in the 
pitcher had poisoned us all, and 
saw Gibbons and Corelli staring 
at each other with the same 
startled look in their eyes. One 
of the Haslops was hit, too — he 
had the same pinched expression 
around the mouth, and perspiration stood out on his forehead in 
drops as big as grapes. 

And then the four of us were 
on our feet and dashing for open 
country, leaving the Quack and 
the remaining Haslop staring after 
us. The Haslop who stayed 
looked puzzled, I thought, but 
the Quack only seemed interested and very much entertained. 

I couldn't be sure of that, 
though. There wasn't time to 
look twice. 

WHEN we came back to the 
court later, shaken and pale 
and bracing ourselves for another 
dash at any minute, we found 
Gaff a and his grinning chums 
congratulating the Quack. The 
bogus Haslop had dropped his 
impersonation act and seemed 
very happy. 

"I've learned to like Haslop so 
well after twenty-two years," he 



84 




 



said, "that I'm quite prejudiced 
in favor of his species, and I'm 
delighted that we are to join your 
Realm. Balak and Terra will get 
along famously, I know, since you 
people are so ingenious and appreciative of humor." 

We ignored the Balakians and 
swooped down on the Quack. 

"You put something in that 
pitcher after you drank out of 
it, you insult to humanity," I 
said. "What was it?" 

The Quack backed off with a 
wary look in his eye. 

"A recipe from the curiosa section of my medical book," he 
said. "I whipped up some capsules for my pocket kit, just in 
case of emergency, and I couldn't 
help thinking of them when — " 

"Never mind the buildup," 
Captain Corelli said. "What was 
it?" 

"A formula invented by ancient 
Terran bartenders, and not 
recommended except in extreme 
cases," the Quack said. "With a 



very odd name. It's called a twin 
Mickey." 

We'd probably have murdered 
him then and there if the Quack's 
concoction had let us. 

Later on we had to admit that 
the Quack had actually done us 
a service, since his identifying the 
real Haslop saved us from being 
marooned for life on Balak. And 
the Balakians were such an immediate sensation in the Terran 
Realm that the Quack's part in 
their admittance made him famous overnight. Somebody high 
up in Goverment circles got him 
out of Solar Exploitations field 
work and gave him a sinecure in 
an antibiotics laboratory, where 
he wound up as happy as a pig 
in a peanut field. 

Which points up the statement 
I made in the beginning, that one 
thing you never have to worry 
about in Solar Exploitations work 
is being bored. 

You see what I mean?
