Warming Sun R. D. NICHOLSON 

FOR about the last five hundred hours of deceleration, 
the rings were plainly visible to the unaided eye. Looking 
out through the ports and seeing 
Saturn, suspended in three-quarter phase against the blackness, 
we realized fully for the first time 
that we were approaching the 
outermost dwelling-place of Man 
— his closest colonized approach 
to the edge of interstellar emptiness. 

Grenville was in high spirits at 
the long and cramped voyage 
being nearly over, and even before Titan showed a perceptible 
disc, he was floating about the 
cabin singing happily to himself. 
Dagmar was still as sulky and 
disagreeable as she had been for 
most of the voyage. The bursts 
of boisterous good humor which 
from the start had intermittently 
broken this mood, however, began to increase in frequency. 

Of course she was looking forward to getting out of that 
cramped little spaceboat even 
more than Grenville and myself. 
She had said a lot of bitter words 
on the way about the discomfort 
of living in the small cabin for so 
long, with only a blanket stretched across it to give her a bit of privacy. Also, sanitary arrangements in such small craft are 
necessarily rather primitive, 
which annoyed her even more. 

Women can be so damned 
practical— even when fleeing for 
their lives! 

TVTE were within Titan's orbit 
about its primary when 
Grenville told me we were going 
to have trouble getting down. 

"It'll mean a braking orbit 
through the atmosphere, Mr. 
Clemmenceton. We had to take 
a chance on cutting it this fine, 
and it looks as though we're on 
the losing end. We're in for a 
hard bump." 

"Well, do your best," I said. 

"I t K; nk we should be able to 
touch down without killing ourselves, but we'll have to get into 
spacesuits and be well strapped 
in for it." 

"You won't be able to control 
the ship strapped into a bumpseat," I objected. 

He grinned at me and said: "I 
can strap my head and body firm, 
and leave the arms and legs out. 
That will do." 

So that was how we did it. 
Dagmar, of course, complained 
irritably about the whole performance, but was too concerned 
about keeping that beautiful, delicate body of hers from getting 
hurt to neglect any of the precautions. 



It would be a pity to have got 
this far only to crash on Titan 
itself, I reflected. But Grenville 
would get us down safely if anyone could. He was a magnificent 
space pilot. Certainly few others 
could have evaded those two 
cruisers which challenged us just 
beyond the orbit of Mars. The 
following two weeks of sporadic 
acceleration and sidewinding ate 
up our fuel load, but they got us 
safely into the Asteroid Belt, 
where the cruisers' detection gear 
was useless. Now, though, without enough fuel for a landing, we 
faced the reckoning. 

We struck the outer fringes of 
Titan's methane atmosphere still 
doing over five miles a second. 
The poor little yacht heated up 
like a reactor. Fortunately, the 
outside temperature was something like minus one hundred 
Centigrade, and the heat was dispersed fast enough to keep the 
outer skin no hotter than a dull 
red. 

The refrigeration pumps were 
overloaded keeping the inside 
temperature down, but we were 
in suits by this time and not too 
worried. 

Grenville carefully kept fuel 
consumption down to a minimum, letting the atmospheric 
drag do all the work. It was a 
masterly display of craftsmanship, but, even so, it was not 
enough to avoid a crash.

Grenville had strapped Dagmar and myself so tightly into 
the shock-seats that neither of us 
could move a limb. Then he had 
fixed chest, thigh and waist bands 
about himself and adjusted the 
headrest to hold his head firm. 

The tank dials showed "empty" 
at about nine hundred feet from 
the surface, but we got down to 
a hundred before the braking 
blasts cut out. Then we dropped 
free and hit hard with a grinding 
crunch. 

I was momentarily dazed by 
the jar, but unhurt. Dagmar was 
apparently unconscious, though 
not visibly injured. I looked forward to see Grenville, his safety 
straps torn from their fastenings, 
thrown limply over the control 
panel. I Waited a moment to recover a little, then pushed the 
release button under the seatarm, slipped free, and maneuvered over to him. 

As I reached him, I heard a 
soft moan from Dagmar, and 
turned to see her open her eyes. 
She said a few choice words about 
Grenville and myself, and started 
to feel for her own release button. 
I gathered from this that there 
was nothing seriously the matter 
with her and turned my attention 
back to Grenville. 

TTIS face was very white. His 
suit radio had been left on, 
and I tried to rouse him by call


ing his name. No result. Dagmar 
was ignoring us both. She shuddered violently, then dropped her 
space-helmeted head into her 
gauntleted hands and began to 
cry. Grenville's lips moved slightly. I called his name again, and 
this time he blinked his eyes open. 
Immediately, pain made him 
catch his breath sharply. 

"Oh, God, my leg!" he groaned. 

He had been stretched across 
the lower bank of firing levers, 
with his left leg twisted and 
forced between one of the stanchions and the instrument panel 
supports. His spacesuit had not 
been punctured, but from the 
way his leg was twisted, it looked 
as though there would be a break 
somewhere above the knee. 

"It's bleeding," he said between 
clenched teeth. "The whole leg 
is warm and sticky." 

"Dagmar, see if the airlock 
works," I called. 

It didn't register. She was still 
crying. 

I left Grenville and climbed aft 
over the mass of jUhk littered 
over the buckled floor-plates. The 
airlock, I found, had been dented, 
but not totally wrecked, and 
might still be airtight. 

I returned for Grenville, carried him into the lock in a fireman's lift — strenuous work for a 
man well into his fifties, even in 
Titan's point three gravity — and 
opened the small test-valve in the 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN

gasket of my helmet to sniff the 
air. It was cold and smelled 
slightly of methane. There was 
a leak somewhere, probably 
around some part of the outer 
door, but only a slow one. 

"We'll have time to look at 
that leg before the air gets bad," 
I told Grenville. "I'll help you 
peel off that suit." 

Sitting on the metal floor with 
his legs stretched out in front of 
him, he rolled first to one side 
and then the other so I could get 
his spacesuit off. Then it took 
only a few seconds to rip his uniform trouser leg and expose the 
thigh. 

I got a nasty shock when I 
saw the break, a bad compound 
fracture. He had already lost a 
lot of blood, and there was no 
time to be wasted in getting a 
tourniquet into place. He had to 
do it himself, tying the torn 
cloth above the wound, because 
the gauntlets of the suit I was 
still wearing made my hands far 
too clumsy for the task. He tied 
the last knot and the spurt of arterial blood eased to a red trickle. 

A spasm of coughing shook 
him, and he started to rub his 
eyes. 

"Just finished in time," he 
gasped, blinking tearily. "Methane's bad enough, but now I'm 
beginning to get lungfuls of ammonia. It hurts the leg like 
blazes, too. Give me a hand." 



He lifted his helmet into place 
and I got him back into his suit. 




VIOLENT pounding on the 
inner door told" us Dagmar 



was over one emotional reaction 
and ready for another. The intercom was out of action and the 
helmet radios useless with the 
steel bulkhead between us, but 
as I had spun the handle and begun to open the door, her angry 
voice sounded from my earphones. 

" — by myself out there! By 
God, Wolseley, I'll get even with 
you for dragging me along on 
this idiotic — " 

"Easy, woman; we're in no 
danger now, and I had to help 
tie up Grenville's leg," I answered, as gently as I could. "Come 
on, we'll get outside and see if 
we're in sight of the domes." 

I lifted Grenville again, while 
he protested vigorously that one 
leg was enough to get around on 
in the light gravity. 

"You won't be able to do anything when we get outside, anyway," he added. "The horizon 
will be too close for us to see 
more than a mile or so away. 
We'll just have to wait for them 
to come and get us. There's not 
a chance of us finding the domes 
ourselves." 

By this time, Dagmar had the 
outer door open. The locks of all 
spacecraft open inward to facili

tate escape in difficult situations, 
as well as to use the air pressure 
to keep them tightly closed in 
space. In this case, it was certainly handy. 

Titan's surface is predominantly ice, with a lot of ammonium 
carbonate and ammonia incorporated into the ice. Our nearly 
red-hot ship had struck with the 
obvious result. I estimated we 
had sunk about ten feet into the 
ice, so that, if the airlock door 
had opened outward, I couldn't 
have squeezed through to cut 
steps up to the surface. 

I lifted Grenville on to the ice, 
climbed down again and reached 
back fb help Dagmar. She took 
my hand, raced lightly up ahead 
of me, and gave a relieved smile. 
We looked eagerly about us for 
signs of life. 

I hoisted myself atop the hull, 
but could still see only the jagged 
ice mountains, glinting in the 
cold white light of the distant 
Sun. I slid back to join the others. 

Dagmar, I think, was about to 
make some sarcastic remark 
about my choice of a destination 
or Grenville's skill as* a pilot, 
when our radios came to life. 

"Hello, spaceship! Is anyone 
receiving me? Are you all right?" 

I motioned the others to quietness and answered. "Spaceship 
Ether Master here. We are getting you. We're down in the ice. 
The ship is a wreck and the 



pilot's hurt, but we're all alive. 
Can you pick us up?" 

"I hear you, Ether Master. We 
are coming for you in a crawler. 
We should reach you in about 
fifteen minutes." 

"Thank God!" Dagmar exclaimed. "Civilization!" 

We heard a voice exclaim, "A 
woman!" and then we settled 
down to wait for our rescuers. 

ri^HE noise of their antiquated 
■■- machine carried on the thin 
cold air, and we could hear them 
coming, even through our heavy 
helmets, long before we could see 
them. Then at last they appeared, grinding their way toward us 
in a cloud of pulverized ice. 

The crawler was a hybrid monstrosity obviously built here in 
the colony, where workshop facilities were limited, and designed to operate in the fantastic 
conditions of Man's most distant 
outpost. Its ribbed metal treads 
were each thirty inches wide. Its 
riveted body could not have 
weighed less than fifty Earth 
tons and, as it rumbled along, it 
dropped patches of some black 
low-temperature lubricant on the 
ice behind it. 

It lurched to a halt a few yards 
from us, and a dense cloud began 
to form about twenty feet above 
its vertical exhaust pipe. With a 
bang, the front dropped open, 
and a figure, moving with the

ease of long familiarity with his 
old-fashioned spacesuit, strode 
toward us. 

"Welcome to the last frontier, 
friends!" boomed a great voice 
in our helmets. "Tell us what 
brings you to the forgotten colony. Who did you kill? Or are you 
just in quest of the simple life?" 

"I am Wolseley Clemmenceton, 
President of the Triplanetary Republic, and my companions are 
the Lady Dagmar Educe and 
Major Grenville, who is hurt," 
I announced formally. 

A second, somewhat slighter 
figure joined the first and exclaimed: "Ha! The biter bit! We 
hope you'll be happy here. You'll 
probably become President, of the 
Titan Political Exiles Club if a 
Navy cruiser doesn't come for 
you first." 

I peered at his helmeted face 
and struggled to place the voice. 
Then I remembered. 

"Carter, Director of Venus!" 

"An honor to be remembered 
by my— ah — successor, I am 
sure." 

Dagmar gave a short nasty 
laugh. Carter spoke again. 

"A few years on Titan rub 
away a lot of the petty motivations that dominate the inner 
planet way of life, Clemmenceton. Out here, we no longer have 
vast empires and millions of subjects to fight over. We will probably get along well." 



"How cozy!" commented Dagmar. 

"Now that the little pleasantries have been concluded," I said, 
"I would like to get my pilot to 
a medical man as soon as I can." 

"All right, everybody into the 
crawler," said Carter's companion, and turned to give me a hand 
with Grenville. 

%W 7E clanked up the sloping 
* * front, set Grenville down on 
the only bit of unobstructed floor 
space in the cabin — directly 
behind the driver's seat — and 
Carter started the small motor 
hauling up the drop-front. 

His companion introduced himself: "My name is Joe Gunn, 
folks. If you think we'd better 
get your friend out of his suit, we 
can seal this cabin and fill it with 
air. It's not regular practice because oxygen-methane mixtures 
are touchy, and it's more efficient 
to run these things full of methane and wear^suits. We can do it 
easy enough when it's necessary, 
though — just blow the methane 
out with nitrogen from the cylinder before bringing up the oxygen concentration, so we don't 
get an explosion mixture in the 
cabin." 

I looked at Grenville. His face 
looked very white in its fishbowl, 
and though obviously fully conscious — he had helped us get him 
into the vehicle — he had not 



92 




 



spoken since we left the ship. 

"I think we should have another look at that tourniquet, old 
man," I said. 

Grenville nodded, and I saw 
that his teeth were still clamped 
together. I turned to Gunn. 

"Get this contraption rolling 
while you blow the methane out, 
will you, please? And is there any 
first-aid equipment aboard?" 

The clumsy machine lurched 
and began to swing about, with 
Carter at the controls. A shrill 
whistle told us Gunn was changing the air. They weren't much 
help in the way of medical supplies, however. 

"Our first-aid equipment consists of adhesive patches for 
stopping suit leaks," Gunn explained. 

I eased Grenville's leg out of 
the suit and loosened the tourniquet for a moment. Dagmar looked away quickly. Gunn squatted 
beside us. 

"You may hose that leg, fella," 
he said quietly. 

"At the moment, I'd be glad 
to," Grenville gritted. 

I was glad to hear him say 
something, a reaction which made 
me realize how much I had come, 
to depend on him since the insurrection. 

I looked at his thigh. It was 
certainly a mess. The sooner it 
was getting proper attention, the 
better I would like it. 



rpiHE noise Gunn made moving 
-■- around caused me to look up. 

"Now that we're well on our 
way, I thought I'd break out 
some rations," he said. "See what 
you think of our local version of 
coffee and biscuits." 

"What kind of state of affairs 
did you leave behind you, Clemmenceton?" Carter asked over his 
shoulder. 

"A fantastic botch. Hasn't any 
news of it come out here?" 

"Not in the past six Earth 
months. Your lunar station quit 
beaming messages out here at 
the end of February." 

"That was just about when 
things began to get really out of 
hand. Right up to the end, we 
were holding our own on Mars 
and Venus, but Terra was a cauldron of fury. The Emindale interests engineered the big protein crisis around the middle of 
last year, and Jockatra riots, followed. Grellet got control of the 
Public Order Force, through his 
dummy, McCardle, and built it 
up to face the so-called threat of 
the civil disorders his own agents 
were stirring up. 

"It was plain by then that more 
than just the usual pressure tactics and maneuverings of various 
interests were in progress. While 
I was occupied with this side of 
the plot, the Gordinester family 
acquired control of the spacelines. 
I caught onto the trend of the 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN 



93 



whole thing too late. I declared 
martial law and tried to strongarm my way through, but their 
planning had been too thorough. 
It was impossible to keep control 
on Earth, and their stranglehold 
on interplanetary travel prevented us from drawing support from 
Mars and Venus. The administration collapsed and its members 
scattered." 

"You always saw yourself as 
a twenty-third-century Julius 
Caesar," said Carter, "unifying 
and inspiring a republic torn by 
civil war and overrun with 
corrupt officials, didn't you, 
Clemmenceton? We had a selfcontained highly mechanized and 
developed culture on Venus, had 
cut our ties with a decadent Earth 
which was unable even to keep 
order at home at that stage, and 
could have preserved our achievements almost indefinitely if you 
hadn't forced us back into the 
Republic at gun-point. I gather 
your attempted strong-arm tactics failed. Apparently you reunified the Solar System only so 
it could all collapse together." 

¥ SHOOK my head stubbornly, 
•* as argumentative as if on a 
TV debate. 

"Someone had to try to restore 
central government, Carter. 
'When the government is weak, 
the people are oppressed', as Anatole France put it. Your 'highly 



developed' Venusian culture was 
completely static. Earth and 
Mars, where life was easier, were 
slipping back fast. For eleven 
years, I held the Republic together by playing one interest 
against another, and broke up 
the private armies with the threat 
of the bombardment squadrons. 

"It was always a precarious 
balance, but while it lasted the 
Interplanet rocket services kept 
regular schedules again, and the 
Lunar Station kept beaming. If 
I hadn't grasped the reins when 
I did, there would have been no 
space communications at all in 
a few more years." 

Carter grinned. "You consider, 
then, that the day of the bow and 
arrow and the hand-plough will 
return soon, now that the Republic is deprived of your guiding hand?" 

"We shall see. Old Grellet is 
as cunning as they come, but I 
cannot see him holding the Presidency for any length of time. The 
very forces he used to upset my 
administration must inevitably 
destroy him. The powerful families were his allies against me, 
but they will not submit to his 
rule. Nor will the mobs he stirred 
up with promises of restoring the 
old freedoms and luxuries of last 
century. 

"His polygot following of incompatibles was united only 
against my government. With 



94 




 



that destroyed, they must be 
tearing at each other right now. 
Even if it has the strength to ride 
the storm, it will be a strife -torn 
and weakened Republic that he 
rules. I could never imagine him 
being able to spare a cruiser to 
come out here after me." 

"But then you never managed 
to spare one to chase me, either," 
Carter said softly, and chuckled. 

The crawler lurched on, and, 
lost in introspection, I did not 
answer. 

"Mr. Gunn, would you help me 
get these boots off, please?" 

Dagmar, naturally. It was her 
typical reaction to being ignored. 

Big Joe Gunn bent down and 
loosened the straps, and held the 
boots one at a time while she 
withdrew her feet. Removing 
spaceboots is a process that is 
little bother to perform for oneself. I watched with the mild interest of one who views still 
another variation played on a 
familiar theme. Carter looked 
back to see what was going on, 
and laughed loudly. Gunn glared 
at him. 

"How far to Morgan?" I asked 
Carter. 

"If you come up forward here, 
you can see two of the domes 
just beyond that big outcrop," 
he replied. 

"Good. Can you call ahead and 
get a doctor to stand by for 
Grenville?" 



"I've done that. There will be 
a welcoming committee for you, 
too." His voice was quite expressionless, and I found it impossible to read his meaning. 

Dagmar paused in arranging 
her hair and looked at me. I 
shrugged and smiled slightly. 
Gunn, holding her handkerchief, 
resumed the task she had given 
him of removing smudges of dirt 
from her face. 

A couple of minutes later, we 
were at the airlock of the largest 
dome. 

TWTE three inner-planet people 
™ stared about us like tourists. 
Morgan consisted of eight domes, 
varying between two -hundred 
and five-hundred meters in diameter, and connected by low, covered passageways. Between each 
dome and the surrounding ice 
was a thick rim of some non-metallic material, which in most 
cases projected two to three feet 
from the ground, and up to 
which ramps had been built to 
the airlocks. 

Our clumsy vehicle rolled up 
one of these, through the outer 
doorway, and halted before the 
inner. It took several minutes to 
pump the methane from the lock 
and flood it with air, and then 
the inner door opened and we 
drove into the dome proper. 

"Usually we leave these things 
outside," Carter explained. "They 



FA:R FROM THE WARMING SUN 



95 



take up too much room in the 
domes, but at the moment this is 
the gentlest way of getting your 
pilot into the right hands." 

"Good. Thanks for the consideration, Carter." 

When we dropped the front of 
the crawler, we were met by the 
doctor and the committee Carter 
had spoken of. Nothing was said 
until the doctor, a heavily built 
man, past middle-age and with 
■coarse ruddy features, had Grenville loaded on a wheeled stretcher and taken away. Then I looked 



up at the three men who stood 
waiting nearby. 

"You wish to talk business, 
gentlemen?" I inquired. 

"Yes, Clemmenceton," the foremost answered. "There are certain formalities to be attended 
to. You have met Mr. Carter, I 
see. This is Mr. Pelotzi and this 
is Mr. Brown. I am Rodericks, 
the Mayor. The four of us, together with Mr. Velez and Mr. 
Goth, who are busy elsewhere, 
constitute the Council which administers Morgan Settlement. To

us, then, you and your companions may address a request to be 
allowed to take up residence in 
the Independency." 

"What is the correct formula? 
We, Wolseley Clemmenceton, 
Dagmar Educe and Martin Grenville, hereby request — " 

"Yes, that'll do. Now, in order 
to compensate the people of the 
Independency for accepting you, 
what have you to offer?" 

"What? What use have you for 
Republican man-hour credits 
when there's no intercourse between here and the Republic? Or 
do you mean what skills have we 
to place at the colony's disposal?" 

"Neither. You came in a spaceship which is now lying slightly 
battered some miles out there." 
He waved an arm in the direction 
we had come from. "To us, that 
ship represents a fortune in heavy 
machinery which we have inadequate facilities to make ourselves. 
To you, it is a wreck and nothing 
more. Add to this the fact that 
you are not in a position to bargain, and I think you will agree 
that it is not an unreasonable 
price for citizenship." 

The man introduced as Brown, 
tall, dark and about forty, nodded at me and took up the conversation. 

"I won't blame you if you call 
this outright piracy, but piracy 
of one sort or another has always 
been a government's prerogative. 



When you have seen a bit of our 
way of life here, you will understand that we have to drive hard 
bargains to maintain a reasonable 
living standard for all. Now 
what's your answer?" 

T GAVE him what I imagine 
■■■ looked like a rather sardonic 
smile. 

"Your price is accepted," I 
said. "I have driven some hard 
bargains myself in my time and 
don't expect charity. The ship is 
yours. Now you can tell us something of our rights and responsibilities as Titanian citizens." 

Carter answered me. "It's all 
pretty straightforward. Everyone 
works. Many of us have two jobs 
and some have more. The standard of living is higher than most 
inner- planet people seem to think, 
however. You understand, of 
course, that if an armed ship arrives to take you back to the 
Republic, no attempt will be 
made to protect or hide you. Is 
that clear?" 

"Fair enough," I replied. "Well, 
now that that's settled, I'd like 
to see how Grenville is getting 
along. Was he taken to a hospital 
or don't you have any?" 

"One moment. We have to vote 
on your admission. All in favor? 
Carried. Carter, will you take 
Clemmenceton to the hospital? 
I'll get citizenship papers made 
out presently. No hurry. Gunn, 



99 




 



where are you going with that 
woman?" 

"Going to show her around the 
domes," said Gunn. "Any objections?" 

"That depends on Mr. Clemmenceton," Rodericks answered. 
"It's his affair, it seems to me." 

They waited for my comment, 
Dagmar challenging me silently 
to refuse. 

"No objection whatever," I 
said. "Go right ahead. Mr. Carter, 
I'm ready if you are." 

Carter took me down a kind of 
thoroughfare between the rows of 
boxlike homes, factories, storehouses and office buildings. The 
entire inside of the dome was 
floored with the same mottled 
brown material we had noticed 
between the smooth painted white 
of the dome and the outside ice. 

"It's the best insulator we've 
got," Carter explained. "We could 
stand a lot higher heat loss than 
we have at the moment, but if we 
passed much more heat than we 
do out through the bases and 
walls of the domes, the whole 
setup would just melt its way 
right down to the core of the 
satellite and let the ice close again 
over it." 

"Oh," I said, "I see. The case of 
the missing colony, eh?" 

"The next place down here is 
the hospital. Doc Hawthorn and 
his wife and their three daughters live in and run the place. The 



Doc learned his profession here, 
by the way. He's never been off 
Titan in his life." 

"What's that? University training here?" 

"Oh, Lord, no. Everything is on 
the apprenticeship system. We've 
made it work surprisingly well, 
you know. Medicine, of course, 
is the worst off. There are hardly 
any books, no experimental animals at all and very few facili^ 
ties. A youngster just has to pick 
it up by working under the old 
doctor. Rather hard on the patient at times, but successful on 
the whole. The two kids studying 
under Hawthorn these days are 
both promising youngsters. They 
are probably getting a lesson in 
fracture and arterial bleeding 
right now." 

I felt some misgivings about 
the treatment Grenville would be 
receiving. 

"There was something else that 
caught my attention in that remark of yours," I said. "Your 
mention of the three daughters of 
the doctor living at home. I 
should imagine there would still 
be a heavy preponderence of 
menfolk here. How come there 
are three unattached women?" 

"A conclusion wrongly jumped 
to, old man. The daughters are 
all married and there are a couple of kids running about the 
place. The men go out to work 
and their wives do a good job of 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN 



99 



combining domestic and nursing 
duties. The family group like 
that is the natural economic and 
social unit here. The shortage of 
living space keeps the group together even when it gets bigger." 

WITH the excitement of the 
crash and the bumpy trip 
to the settlement now some time 
behind me, I was beginning for 
the first time to be really curious 
about the way these people lived. 
I wondered what kind of future 
they looked forward to, and I 
asked Carter. 

"We look to the future a great 
deal. More than you would think, 
I suppose. With a bigger population, we could do more and life 
would be better for everyone. 
You will notice it in the colonists' 
attitudes. Your bringing a mistress along, for instance, will be 
distinctly disapproved of." 
"Small-town morality." 
"No, not a bit. Children are allimportant to our way of thinking, and relationships like yours 
are not usually productive. That's 
the only reason." 

"Hm. I always wanted children 
myself, but there were so many 
things against it. Now I probably 
never will have them. Dagmar 
doesn't want a child. There were 
other women back on Earth. I 
might have married, left an 
heir—" 

"I don't think Lady Dagmar 



will like the colony. I doubt if 
it will like her." 

I smiled at him. "You're getting old, Carter. More so than I 
am, apparently. Didn't you notice Gunn's reaction? Dagmar 
might not like the colony, but 
her wiles work as well here as 
anywhere else. I wonder what effect she's having on Gunn right 
now." 

He looked at me intently for a 
moment. He wonders how jealous 
I am, I thought. Then he looked 
away and silently continued leading me through the settlement. 

The hospital was a square 
building of about average size for 
the dome we were in. It had two 
stories, the lower of which was 
devoted to beds, an operating 
theater and a dispensary. The 
second story was the living quarters of the Hawthorns. 

Carter knocked perfunctorily 
and we walked straight in. 

"General ward," Carter explained over his shoulder. "Surgery this way." 

npHERE were half a dozen beds 
-■■ in the outer room, two of 
them occupied by men who eyed 
us curiously as we passed through, 
and one bed was screened off. The 
place was clean and everything 
in it was neatly arranged. As 
I looked at the plain iron bedsteads with their coarse white 
bedding, I grew more aware of 



100 




 



the isolation of this colony and 
its continual battle with its unfriendly surroundings. They had 
kept it free of the mental decay 
that had destroyed the spirit of 
enterprise and respect for ethical 
standards among the peoples of 
the more comfortable inner planets. 

We knocked on the surgery 
door, a thin sheet of plastic in a 
metal frame, like most of the 
doors on this world, constructed 
without wood. 

"Carter and your patient's 
friend; we've come to see how the 
injured pilot is getting on," Carter answered to an inarticulate 
inquiring noise from within. 

"Come in. He'll live." 

We did so, to see Grenville 
with a trussed-up leg, Hawthorn 
with a satisfied expression on his 
face, two young men — both, I 
should say, about twenty-two or 
three — who were apparently the 
apprentice doctors, and a girl in 
white who, I supposed, was one 
of Hawthorn's daughters. 

"Nastiest compound • fracture 
I've seen in years," the medical 
man said to us. "He's not in any 
danger of losing the leg now, but 
it probably won't ever fully recover. The broken bone has done 
a lot of damage to the nerves in 
the forward part of the thigh. 
Still, I think we can patch him 
up well enough to make a useful 
citizen of him again." 



Grenville smiled a little grimly. "How useful a citizen will a 
space pilot with only one good 
leg make?" 

Hawthorne frowned at him. 

"Don't cast aspersions on my 
ability, young man. You'll have 
two good legs. One of them just 
won't be up to carrying you 
around on hundred-meter dashes 
and so forth. You'll only be able 
to catch the women that want to 
be caught from now on." 

"Well, Grenville," I said, "look 
after yourself, and do what the 
doctor tells you. Dagmar and I 
will get settled somewhere — I 
think she is out laying the 
groundwork for herself, anyway, 
at the moment — then, when we've 
found out what the settlement 
expects of us, we'll pay you a 
social call. You will probably be 
given something like a plant operator's job. What I shall do, I 
don't know. My trade is politics, 
but I think there would be some 
objections to my practicing it 
here." 

Carter looked up, an unfathomable expression on his face for a 
moment. 

"All right now," the doctor 
said. "Clear out, all of you. We 
have Work to do. Visiting hours 
are over." 

"Right," I answered. "See you 
later, Grenville. I dare say it 
won't be long before you're up 
and about again." 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN

A FTER we left, I asked Carter 
how we would get on for accommodations. 

"Mayor Rodericks is getting 
something lined up for you, I 
think, though Lady Dagmar appears to have ideas of her own on 
that score. She seems to be trying 
to talk Joe Gunn into taking her 
in.'.' 

He watched me closely for a 
reaction. I grunted noncommittally. Dagmar's conduct was not 
altogether surprising to anyone 
who knew her as well as I did. 
At the moment, she was furious 
that she had allowed herself to 
become involved in my misfortunes, and was seeking comfort 
in the attentions of a young and 
good-looking admirer. What her 
next move would be, however, I 
doubted if she knew herself. 

Carter and I turned a corner 
and almost collided with the 
councilor named Pelotzi. 

"Ah!" he exclaimed. "I've been 
looking for you. We checked up 
on living space and we find that 
we can give the three of you 
rooms in Residence Four in 
Aaron Dome. That's the small 
one, over there." 

"Thank you, Councilor," I 
said. "It may be some time before Major Grenville can be 
moved from the hospital, but I 
' shall go to the quarters myself 
as soon as I can. Whether the arrangements will Suit Lady Dag


mar or not, I cannot say." 

He coughed apologetically. "I 
am afraid they will have to, Mr. : 
Clemmenceton. There is no other 
place available." 

Carter and I both smiled. 

"Can I get over and have a 
look around now?" I asked. 

"Certainly, Mr. Clemmenceton. 
I'm sure Mr. Carter will take you 
there." 

"Does every new arrival upset 
the whole system of government 
like this? I mean get personally 
shown to his quarters by the Immigration Secretary or whatever 
you are?" 

"Well, it's three Earth years 
since the last ship came out this 
way, so there's no great strain 
involved," Carter answered. 

Pelotzi left us, and Carter resumed his role of guide. We passed through the connecting 
passageway with its airtight bulkheads at each end, and entered 
Aaron Dome. 

"Aaron is mainly residential 
buildings," said Carter, "except 
for a couple of places over there 
where we do a bit of air process- ■ 
ing. This is Residence Four right 
here." 

TIE opened one of the now fa-* -■• miliar metal-framed plastic 
doors, and we entered a small ' 
foyer in which was an unattended desk. Taking a book from it, 
he leafed through the pages to 



102 




 



find the numbers of the unoccupied rooms. 

"Third floor," he said, penciling something in the book. "A 
bedroom each', and a bathroom 
and lounge that you'll share with 
the other couple on the floor. We 
can't afford to waste any space, 
but we're not really badly 
crowded." 

"From all appearances, I'd say 
you lived pretty well out here." 

"We do all right. Consumer 
goods are scarce — all those things 
that are mass-produced so cheaply on the inner planets — and we 
lack adequate school and medical 
facilities. Just the same, the necessities of life are in reasonable 
supply, and we have a bit of 
leisure time, and a few luxuries." 

"I can't tell you how impressed 
I am by the way you've got the 
technical side of things sewn up. 
Back on Earth, I knew you'd 
had no supply ship for three 
years, but I just didn't realize 
what that implied. I think I pictured Titan as an out-of-the-way 
colony of shaggy hillbillies, gradually reverting to savagery on a 
bleak, unfriendly world." 

"Ha! You missed the point. In 
a really hostile setting like this, 
you either keep your technology 
up to the mark or die. That's why 
this settlement won't ever slip 
into decadence, even if all the 
rest of the Solar System does. And 
there's another reason, too— the 



kind of people who've been able 
to adapt themselves to life on 
Titan are not the ones to sit idly 
by and watch their world fall 
apart. The pioneering stock, the 
misfits from the more ordered 
and organized and safer life of 
the inner worlds, generations of 
political refugees, they've built a 
world that can look forward when 
civilization everywhere else is 
crumbling from the dry rot. 

"Take the emphasis on children here that I was telling you 
about. The bigger our population 
gets, the more specialization is 
possible and the better life becomes for everyone. Well, anyway, here's the Presidential Suite, 
so I'll cut the sales talk." 

I took the irony in good part. 
He selected a key, opened the 
door, and we both went in. 

"Here are your keys," he said, 
and handed them to me. "There 
are crawlers out already to bring 
your ship to the domes for stripping, so you'll be able to rescue 
your personal effects before long." 

T GLANCED around the quarters and was pleasantly surprised by their undeniably plain 
but eminently comfortable-looking furnishings. Nearly everything in sight was made of one 
plastic or another. 

Carter told me more about the 
colony's industry : 

"We've all the power we want 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN 



103 



from big hydrogen - powered 
spaceship engines. Ice, ammonia 
and methane are our main raw 
materials, with the metals at a 
premium. We do a bit of direct 
synthesis for some foodstuffs and 
our plastics and textiles, but most 
of our complex organics come 
from the culture vats. At present, 
we're trying to develop a strain 
of—" 

The door was thrown violently 
open to admit an apologetic 
Pelotzi, driven before one of Dagmar's most violent rages. Seeing 
me, she switched targets. 

"You, you walking antique, you 
drag me away from a life on a 
civilized world where I had every 
comfort and attention to a collection of huts on a chunk of 
ice millions of miles from anywhere! And that animal, Gunn! 
Then they can't give me anywhere to live and they expect me 
to live with you! I must have 
been mad to ever get — " 

"There, there, old girl, you'll 
shock* the hillbillies," I said. 
, Carter laughed uproariously. 
Dagmar picked up a heavy 
carved plastic ornament and 
threw it at him, hitting him on 
the shoulder as he made a belated 
attempt to jump aside. Then she 
turned on me again. She sprang 
like a tiger, and I caught her,, 
wrists to save my face from being, 
clawed. She kicked my shins. 
Carter was still laughing, while 



Pelotzi stood by, looking very 
embarrassed. 

I was not really angry. I had 
been through some tense experiences in the last few months, and 
I think they had tended to deprive my always fairly unexcitable disposition of some of its 
capacity for resentment, at least 
for the time being. I grasped both 
her small wrists in my left hand, 
drew back my right, and hit her 
carefully several times across the 
face. 

She screamed and kicked with 
increased violence for a moment 
or two, then subsided, sobbing. I 
spoke to her quietly. 

"You're misleading yourself, 
my darling. You're forgetting the 
raging mobs too easily. You 
would have been as violently used 
as I would have, if they'd been 
able to lay hands on you. 

"You remember the form Grellet's line took. All the ills of the 
times were due to the lustful and 
irresponsible dictator, meaning 
me, who was impoverishing three 
worlds to rain jewels upon his 
avaricious mistress, meaning you." 

OHE had become quieter. Her 
hands still clenched and unclenched, and her body shook, 
but her eyes were closed. 

"My own fate would have been 
certain, had I been taken," I 
went on. "But imagine the mob's 
delight at the fall of the tyrant's 



104 




 



pampered mistress. You might 
have been hung from a lamopost. You would probably have 
had many elaborate indignities 
perpetrated on you first. Possibly 
have been stripped and knocked 
down to be befouled by the multitude, then executed in some satisfyingly spectacular manner." 

With a sudden wrench she 
tried to free her hands. I had been 
expecting the attempt and it was 
not successful. She cried: 

"It was all your fault! You 
destroyed the power of the only 
people fit to rule Earth and 
cleared the ground for maniacs 
like Grellet. The old families had 
had generations of experience in 
government. You made love to 
me so I would help you stab thenr^child?" 
in the back!" 

"Oh, now wait a minute! You 
were a rebel and a misfit in the 
old oligarchy, just waiting to attach yourself to some ambitious 
lover who would carry you into 
a position of power. Also, remember that your title and connection 
with the families provided Grellet with a weapon to use against 
me. . It allowed him to turn the 
old popular resentment of the 
oligarchs against me, while at the 
same time he bargained with the 
Emindales and Gordinesters to 
get their support. 

"Now you have two choices in 
front of you. I gather from your 
reaction earlier that Gunn can 



be ruled out. You can begin your 
intrigues all over again — and you 
haven't started to lose your looks 
yet — to get what power and 
luxury this world can offer. If 
you do, you'll probably be tarred 
and feathered by the sturdy 
colonial women. 

"Or, if you're willing, and are 
prepared to bear children, we 
could conform to the provincfal 
morality of our adopted home." 

"What are you trying to do?" 
she spat out bitterly, yet with a 
little of doubt and surprise on 
her face. "Do you think you've 
got me in a position where you 
can keep me as an unpaid nurse 
for your old age? What makes 
you think you could have a 



TTER words had been chosen to 
hurt, yet they had not been 
hurled with quite the violence 
their meaning indicated. 

I drew her to me and stroked 
her fair hair. "Who's so old, anyway? And you're no teen-ager 
yourself these days. I might be 
pushing sixty, but while I had 
the rejuvenation treatments and 
attention of the Republic's best 
medical men, I did not age appreciably. I shall probably still 
outlive you because I have a 
more equable disposition. You 
will eventually put a fatal strain 
on your heart or burst a blood 
vessel." 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN

She clung to me. She looked up 
for a moment, disheveled blonde 
hair streaked down over teardirtied face, and smiled as our 
eyes met. 

"Morgan Settlement may be no 
tropic island paradise, but ifs 
no penal colony, either. This 
apartment could be fitted up 
to—" 

Then she dropped her head 
against my chest again and cried 
unrestrainedly. 

Carter took Pelotzi's arm and 
started to propel him from the 
room. 

"It's all display," I explained 
amusedly. "Don't let it worry 
you. Some people call it Irish 
courtship. Freud wrote books 
about it." 

He closed the door. 

It had been more than thirteen 
years since we had first known 
each other, but there is nothing 
like violent emotional disturbance to restore for a night the 
passion of departed youth. 

/BARTER called in again at ten^ thirty the next morning, 
showing for once a politician's 
tact by not coming earlier. 
Though his greeting was cheerily 
informal, he had the manner of a 
man come to talk hard-headed 
business. 

"Well, have you got your domestic affairs settled?" he asked. 

"More or less. I'm expecting." 



"Good God, that was quick!" 1 
"Oh, it might take a couple of 
years. I mean I've assured myself of the opportunity to keep 
trying." 

"I see. Well, that's fine. Now, 
then, the reason for this visit. 
You were talking of 'practicing 
your trade,' as you put it. Well — " 
he gestured me to silence as I 
started to interrupt — "that is 
exactly what we want you to do. 
Take a post on the Federal Council. We're not afraid you'll try 
to make yourself dictator of Titan 
and set out to reconquer your 
lost Empire. Neither am I opposed to the idea on the grounds j 
of old antagonisms. I never did i 
and still don't like a lot of things S 
abdut you and about your view « 
of — well, everything. But, like the 1 
other councilors here, I realize 
how much help your adminis- j 
trative ability can be to us. | 

"The five Titanian settlements \ 
ate largely self-governing, but ) 
do owe allegiance in some matters j 
to a Federal Council. The prob- i 
lems of governing such a con- j 
federacy are enormous, as I \ 
suppose you can imagine." 

"Hold on a minute!" I said, I 
suddenly remembering one of the 
problems. "If radio here is limited j 
to line of sight, how did we get 'i 
Gunn's call from the crawler?" 

"Rocket-aerials. All the crawlers have them so they can call 
the domes and each other from 




 



below their horizons. A small 
rocket carries a fine silver aerial 
up to about two and a half miles. 
That gives a radius of about a 
hundred miles, or two hundred 
if both sender and receiver have 
aerials up." 

"Oh. Very clever. Well, keep 
talking. What other troubles are 
you letting me in for?" 

"Apart from the griefs stemming from the environment, the 
usual run of small-time political 
feuds, nepotism, intercolony jealousies, everyqne trying to get 
more of scarce materials than he's 
entitled to." / 

"What's the setup of the council itself? Is it elected, appointed, 
or what?" 

"Elected, nominally. Each colony has its representatives. We 
won't have any trouble getting 
you in if you decide to accept, 
though." 

T FROWNED and looked as if 
I were thinking deeply, but 
my mind was made up, naturally. 

"I accept, Carter. You know, 
things are working out better for 
me than I had any right to hope 
for. What deposed autocrat, 
after deposition and barely getting away with his life, has ever 
been offered a respectable political appointment in a culture 
which may not be materially 
prosperous, but is definitely sound 



and is progressing, and been able 
also to carry a beautiful woman 
away with him to share his exile 
and raise his family in middleclass respectability?" 

Carter's answer was a slight, 
thin-lipped smile. I read the implication behind it with little 
difficulty. 

"Oh, I have a fair idea of your 
opinion of Dagmar, but you do 
her injustice." Pictures and fragments of reminiscences, some 
clear, some half-faded, were before me as I spoke. I was going 
to become a minor politician, 
with a host of routine duties. 
Well, there is more to life than 
merely satisfying ambition. What 
is a man whose personality is 
totally submerged in his ambition? Yet had I ever been truly 
ambitious? Who knows his own 
desires, at any time? 

Carter smiled still, and I continued. 

"When we first became lovers, 
she was the most talked-of beauty 
of the nobility. Yet she was a 
rebel even then against the casteand-wealth oligarchy. Throughout my eleven years in the lonely 
Damoclean seat, she was almost 
my only confidente ani ally. If 
you attempt to evaluate her on 
the evidence of temper, temperament and flirtation during a short 
twenty-four hours, you will only 
mislead yourself. 

"The wilfulness you've seen;

her strength of character and intelligence, you have not. While 
I presided in the Republic, we 
talked of marriage and an heir. 
She wanted the position and pres


tige of the former, without being 
willing to undergo the discomfort 
of the latter. She is now willing 
to have children, particularly 
since her own youth is going. You

SCIENCE FICTION 



may say that she is still a lot 
younger than I am. True. But 
after all—" 

"Mr. Carter! Mr. Carter! The 
Space Field Tower has spotted 
a ship approaching! A big one!" 

The young colonial who had 
run up with the message was 
puffing hard and trying to get 
his breath back. My stomach felt 
cold. I realized with a jar the 
extent to which overconfidence 
makes men vulnerable to emo- \ 
tional shock. 

"It looks as though you were 
wrong, Clemmenceton — you'll 
have to face the music," Carter 
said softly. 

"My judgment appears to have 
been badly astray," I replied, my 
voice flat and expressionless, and 
speaking half to myself. 

I honestly never believed they 
had the remotest chance of keeping the peace in their own domains with the forces at their 
command, let alone being able to 
spare a cruiser to come out this 
far after me. But very evidently 
they had. 

"Well, perhaps my personal 
misfortune should be weighed 
against the return of stable government to the inner planet people," I murmured. I imagined the 
planets torn by rioting, mob violence, and countless pitched battles. "It just shows how a man 
will overestimate his own importance." 



"TVAGMAR had come quietly 
from the bedroom, and I was 
not aware of her presence until I 
felt her gently rest her hand on 
my arm. 

"And we weren't even unpacked," she said. "Wolseley, 
there's no need to say anything 
about Grenville. They won't be 
looking for him and he wasn't 
really playing empire-builders 
with us." Carter was looking at 
her intently. "We'll p'robably have 
a more comfortable trip back in 
the cruiser's brig than we had 
coming out in the Master's cabin, 
anyway." 

"The tower says they should 
have contact with the ship in not 
much over an hour," the messenger said. 

Dagmar whirled to face him. 
"You mean you haven't spoken 
to them yet? You don't really 
know what they want? What's 
the idea? Are you just trying 
to give Wolseley and me a 
fright?" 

"I'm sorry, Mrs. Clemmenceton," he answered, and I smiled 
at the form of address, "but there 
has been no contact between Titan and the inner worlds for over 
half a year now, and there was 
little enough before that. There 
could be no other reason for a 
big ship coming now." 

Then her eyes filled and I put 
one arm around her and held her 
close. 



FAR FROM THE WARMING SUN 



109 



Carter turned to me and said, 
"I regret this. We could have 
used you to such good purpose. 
We've got a world to run, with 
underpopulation and a shortage 
of machinery and a hostile environment to battle against. I 
wish we could give you sanctuary, 
Clemmenceton, but we just can't 
afford to antagonize the ' inner 
world military. We're quite defenseless here, you see." 

I suppose at that moment my 
feelings were a chaotic admixture. There was a kind of helpless cold fury at being so suddenly deprived of the refuge in 
which I had felt myself safe, an 
angry contempt for Carter and 
the colonials of Titan for their 
fear of Grellet's ship. Of course 
I was aware that this anger 
sprang from my own position, 
but that did not lessen the feel-~ 
ing any. And there was a kind 
of resignation to the inevitable 
— and also a lot of gratitude to 
Dagmar for the way she was taking the ship's arrival. 

"Let's go to the tower," I said. 

"Yes, I suppose we might as 
well. It would be humiliating to 
be taken to the ship under guard. 
Wait while I put some makeup 
on." 

"The reaction," I told Carter, 
"is typical. At times it has been 
an attitude which has infuriated 
me, but, at the moment, I like 
it," 



SHE was only gone a moment, 
however. I looked at her close 
ly when she reappeared. She was 
as lovely as I had ever seen her. 
The light slack -suit, as affected 
by the settlement women, was 
not unbecoming, and together 
with the way her long lightbrown hair was pulled back and 
held by clips, and the lightly 
applied makeup, it made her look 
very young. Carter's face seemed 
to express cynicism, and I think 
embarrassment, as I kissed her 
and we set put for the tower. 

The "space field" was an arbitrarily defined area of , ice, and 
the tower a plastic affair, rising 
about two hundred feet intcv the 
poisonous air. 

In the hemispherical, transparent room at the top were two 
men, one of whom had earphones 
on and sat at the radio table. 
The second turned to face us. 

"No communication with them 
yet, Mr. Carter, though they're 
well within Morse rartge. In fact, 
I'd say now that they are in 
verbal range — ~" 

"Quiet, I'm getting something!" 
interrupted the man wearing the 
- phones. 

He stretched out his left arm 
and cut in the loudspeaker on 
the wall. Through a storm of 
crackling and whistling came a 
man's voice. 

. " — Settlement. Hello, Morgan 4 
Settlement. Spaceship Pax Re

publica calling. Space — crackle, 
crackle — Republica seeking permission to land with a hundred 
and twenty refugees from Earth. 
Seeking — " 

Dagmar's shriek obliterated the 
repeat, and she began to pummel 
my arm and back, incoherently 
exclaiming a series of "We 
needn't go back"s and "I said it 
couldn't be a warship"s and similar things. 

I just suddenly relaxed. The 
shocks were coming in too rapid 
a succession to be appreciated as 
they happened. 

"They'll make it in about ten or 
twelve hours, I should say," the 
operator's assistant said. 

Dagmar and I looked at each 
other, and started back down the 
long stairway. About halfway to 
the bottom was a landing, with a 
big clear port looking out over the 
craggy whiteness. Here we 
paused. 

AS I watched the spectacular 
scintillations of an iceworld 
sunset, my thoughts ran again 
and again over the last hour. 
Here I would still be working 
for something I believed in very 
dearly, though in a small way, 
and without fanfares. Pageantry 
and circumstance, however, I had 
known well, and would not 
mourn their loss. 

Since my first entry into politics at the age of eighteen, just 



before the collapse of the Fourth 
Kingdom, I had belonged to 
many parties and known many 
viewpoints. Then I was a pacifist, 
abhorring bloodshed and violence, 
but, like most, I always recognized the decadence of the times, 
and when the chance came to 
play Caesar, I took it. 

The Empire was still-born, and 
the planets had reverted far 
toward barbarism, but out here, 
beyond the reach of bloody warlords and roving pirates, I would 
play a part in a small culture 
which logically should remain as 
Carter once had hoped his Venusian state would remain — an isolated outpost whose people must 
retain their science merely to 
stay alive, and which would survive to welcome eventually the 
first contact with a resurgent 
inner-world culture. 

Dagmar turned her gaze from 
the sparkling ice crags, so brilliant beneath their blue-black 
sky, and our eyes met. 

It would be a stoic's world to 
bring children into, but one where 
hope and ambition were not unknown, and one that could offer 
the satisfaction that comes from 
achievement. 

Here I would find my personal 
fulfillment. Here 1 would see my 
children grow up, on this farthest 
outpost, far from the warming 
Sun.
