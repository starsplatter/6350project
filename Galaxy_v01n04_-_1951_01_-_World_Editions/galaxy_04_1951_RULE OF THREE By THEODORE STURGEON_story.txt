RULE OF THREE By THEODORE STURGEON 

Of course you'd be host to guests 
from outer space; it's common 
courtesy. Hut being a host can 
have a peculiarly nasty meaning! 



THEY were a decontamination squad — three energyentities (each triple) — on a 
routine check of a known matterentity culture. What they traveled 
in was undoubtedly a 'ship, since it 
moved through space, except that 
it was not a physical structure of 
metal. It slowed down like a light 
wave that had suddenly grown 
tired. 

"There it is," said RilRylRul. 

The two other triads merged 
their light-perceptions and observed 
it. "Out at the edge," said KadKedKud, in satisfaction. "It should 



not be too difficult to handle out 
there. When infection spreads near 
the heart of a Galaxy, it can be 
troublesome." 

MakMykMok cautioned, "Don't 
underestimate the job until it's surveyed." 

"It's a very small sun," said Ril. 
"Which one of the planets is it? 
The fourth?" 

"No, the greenish-blue one, the 
third." 

"Very well." 

In due time the ship — a bubble 
of binding energy and collapsed, 
rarefied gas molecules — entered the 



RULE OF THREE

atmosphere. It reshaped itself gradually into a round-nosed, tapered 
transparency and dropped sharply, 
heading due west over the planet's 
equator. 

"Busy little things, aren't they?" 

As the world turned under them, 
they watched. They saw the ships, 
the cities. In the microscopic, intangible fluxes of force which were 
nerve and sinew and psyche to their 
triple structure, they stored their 
observations. They recorded the 
temperature of steel converters and 
ships' power plants, calculated the 
strength of materials of buildings 
and bridges by their flexure in a 
simply computed wind velocity, 
judged and compared the flowshapes of air and ground vehicles. 

"We could return right now," 
said Kad. "Any race which has 
progressed this far in such a brief 
time must be a healthy one. Otherwise how could — " 

"Look!" Ril flashed. 




HEY watched, appalled. "They 



"It must be a ritual," said Kad, 
"or perhaps a hunt. But we'd better 
investigate closer." 

They dropped down, swiftly 
overtook a low-flying open-cockpit 
biplane with a black cross on the 
fuselage, and settled on the cowling behind the pilot's head. Mak 
interpenetrated the ship's wall and, 
treading and passing the air molecules which fled past, reached the 
pilot's leather helmet at the nape 



of the neck. Contact was made and' 
broken almost in the same moment 
of time, and Mak hurtled back in 
horror to the skin of their ship. 

"Get clear!" he ordered. 

In three microseconds the invisible ship was in the upper atmosphere, with Mak still clinging to 
the outer skin. 

"What was it?" 

"Pa'ak, the most vicious, most 
contagious energy-virus known. 
That creature is crawling with 
them! Never have" I seen such an 
infestation ! Examine me. Irradiate 
me. Be careful, now — be sure." 

It was strong medicine, but effective. Mak weakly permeated 
through the ship's wall and came 
inside. "Disgusting. Utterly demoralizing. How can the creature live 
in that condition?" 

"Worse than Murktur III?" 

"Infinitely worse. On Murktur I 
never saw a concentration higher 
than 14, and that was enough to 
reduce the natives to permanent 
bickering. These bipeds can apparently stand a concentration of over 
120 on the same scale. Incredible." 

"Perhaps that individual is quarantined." 

"I doubt it. It was flying its own 
machine; it can apparently land at 
will anywhere. But we will check 
further. Mak, you were quite right," 
said Ril. "Don't underestimate the 
job, indeed. Why, with an infestation like that, and a drive like that 
. . . what couldn't they accomplish 
if they were clean?"

They swooped close to the land, 
barely touched the hair of a child 
on a hilltop, and soared again, 
shaken and frightened. 

"From what we've seen, that one 
was no more than 15% of maximum size. How do you read the 
Pa'ak concentration?" 

"Over 70. This place is a pesthole. These creatures must be 
stopped — and soon. You know how 
soon such a technology reaches for 
the stars." 

"Shall we send for reinforcements?" 

"Before investigating? Certainly 
not. And after all, there are three 
of us." 

"We shall have to protect ourselves," Ril pointed out. 

"You mean — dissociate? Divide 
our triple selves?" 

"You know that's the only way 
we can remain undetected by the 
Pa'ak. Of course, once we know 
exactly how they have developed 
here, and have analyzed the psychic 
components of the natives, we can 
re-synthesize." 

"I hate the thought of dividing 
myself. So weak, so impotent . . ." 

"So safe. Don't forget that. Once 
we've encased ourselves in the 
minds of these creatures and analyzed them, we'll have to join ourselves again to fight the Pa'ak." 

"Yes, indeed. And we'll be together again soon. Take care," 
added Mak, the cautious one. "The 
Pa'ak are mindless, but exceedingly 
dangerous." 



"Hungry," Kad supplemented. 
"Especially for our kind. Shall 

we begin?" 

The ship disappeared, bursting 
like a bubble. The three dropped, 
sharing a wordless thought that was 
like a handclasp. Then each of 
them separated into three, and the 
nine particles drifted down through 
the atmosphere.

A YOUNG girl lay on her stomach under a tree, reading. She 
yawned widely, choked a little, 
swallowed, and went back to her 
book. 

Two friends shook hands. Later, 
one absentmindedly palmed the 
back of his neck. Something was 
rubbed into his skin. The other 
young man scratched his wrist as 
he walked away. 

Something was in the drinking 
water, though neither the nurse, as 
she filled the glass, nor the little 
girl, as she drank, knew of it. 

Some dust settled on a toothbrush. 

A small boy sank his teeth into 
his bread-and-jam. The rich, red 
preserve drooled to the table. The 
boy put his finger in it, thrust the 
finger into his mouth. 

Another youngster ran through 
the dewy morning grass in his bare 
feet.

Somewhere, two dust motes were 
waiting their turn. 

And a number of years went by.

There was a character at the party 
named Irving, and Jonathan Prince, 
Consulting Psychologist, didn't like 
him. This Irving played guitar and 
sang folksongs in a resonant baritone, which was fine; but after that 
he would put a lampshade on his 
head and be the "March of the 
Wooden Soldiers" or some such, 
and that was as funny, after the 
fourth viewing, as a rubber crutch. 
So Jonathan let his eyes wander. 

When his gaze came to the dark 
girl sitting by the door, his breath 
hissed in suddenly. 

Priscilla was sitting next to him. 
She said "Ouch," and he realized 
he had squeezed her hand painfully. 

"What's the matter, Jon?" 

"I just — nothing, Pris." He knew 
it was tactless, because he knew the 
sharpness of Priscilla's tilted eyes, 
but he couldn't help it; he stared 
back at the dark girl. 

The girl's hair was blue-black 
and gleamed like metal, yet he 
knew how soft it would be. Her 
eyes were brown, wide apart, deep. 
He knew how they would crinkle 
on the outside ends when she 



smiled. He knew, as a matter of 
fact, that she had a small brown 
mole on the inside of her left thigh. 

Irving was still singing. Of 
course it had to be "Black Is the 
Color of my True Love's Hair." 
Priscilla pressed Jon's hand, gently. 
He leaned toward her. 

She whispered, "Who's the 
charmer? Someone you know?" 

He hesitated. Then he nodded 
and said, without smiling, "My exwife." 

Priscilla let his hand go. 

JONATHAN waited until Irving 
finished his song and, in the 
applause, rose. " 'Scuse . . ." he 
muttered. Priscilla didn't seem to 
be listening. 

He crossed the room and stood 
in front of the dark girl until she 
looked up at him. He saw the 
little crinkle by her eyes before he 
saw the smile. 
"Edie." 

"Jon! How are you?" Then she 
said, in unison with him, "Can't 
complain." And she laughed at him. 

He flushed, but it was not anger. 
He sat on the ottoman by her feet. 
"How've you been, Edie? You 
haven't changed." 

"I haven't," she nodded seriously. There was an echo in his mind. 
"We'll always be friends, Jon. 
Nothing can change that." Was 
that what she meant? She said, 
"Still trying to find out how the 
human mind works?" 

"Yes, on the occasions when I 



78 




 



find one that does. Are you in town 
for long?" 

"I've come back. They closed the 
Great Falls office. Jon ..." 

"Yes?" 

"Jon, who's the redhead?" 
"Priscilla. Priscilla Berg. My assistant." 

"She's lovely, Jon. Really lovely. 
Is she . . . are you . . ." 

At last he could smile. "You can 
ask, Edie," he said gently. "Here, 
I'll ask .you first. Are you married?" 

"No." 

"I didn't think so. I don't know 
why, but I didn't think so. Neither 
am I." 

He looked down at his hands because he knew she was smiling, and 
somehow he didn't want to look 
into her eyes and smile too. "I'll 
get us a drink." 

She waited until he was on his 
feet and a pace away before she 
said what she used to say: "Come 
back quickly." 

Someone jostled him at the bar. 

"What's up, Doc?" said Irving, 
and nickered. "Hey, that assistant 
of yours, she drinks scotch, doesn't 
she?" 

"Rye on the rocks," he said absently, and then realized that the 
scotch suggestion was Irving's shot 
in the dark, and that he'd given 
the idiot an opening gambit with 
Priscilla. He was mildly annoyed 
as he ordered two Irish-and-waters 

and went back to Edie.

Communication was dim and labored. 

"We're trapped ..." 

"Don't give up. Ked is very close 
to me now." 

"Yes, you and Ked can achieve 
proximity. But these creatures won't 
combine emotionally in threes!" 

"They can — they must!" 

"Do not force them. Remain encysted and work carefully. Did you 
know the Pa'ak got Mak?" 

"No! How horrible! What about 
Myk and Mok, then?" 

"They will be guardians, watchers, communicators. What else can 
they do?" 

"Nothing . . . nothing. How terrible to be one-third dead! What 
happened to Mak?" 

"The creature Mak occupied 
killed itself, walked in front of a 
speeding vehicle as Mak tried to 
synthesize. Mak could not get clear 
in time from the dead thing." 

"We must hurry or these beasts 
will leap off into space before we 
join our strength again."

THE club wouldn't be open for 
hours yet, but Derek knew 
which of the long row of herculite 
doors would be unlocked. He shouldered it open and sidled in, being 
careful not to let it swing shut on 
his bass viol. 

Someone was playing the piano 
out back. Piano . . . hadn't Janie 
been knocking herself out looking 
for a piano man before he went

away? He mumbled, "Hope 
she — " and then Jane was on, over, 
and all around him. 

"Derek, you tall, short underdone yuk, you!" she crooned. She 
hugged him, and put a scarlet print 
of her full mouth on his cheek. 
"Why didn't you wire? God, man, 
I missed you. Here, put down that 
Steinway and smooch me once. Am 
I glad to see your ugly head . . . 
Look at the man," she demanded 
of. the empty club as he leaned the 
big bass against the wall and stroked its rounded flank with the tips 
of his fingers. "Hey, this is me 
over here." 

"How are you, Janie?" He delivered a hug. "What's been giving 
around here?" 

"Me," she said. "Giving, but 
out. Ma-an ... a hassel. For ten 
days I had a sore throat clear from 
neck to tonsil, carrying that piano 
man. Damn it, I got a way I sing, 
and a piano's got to walk around 
me when I do it. Chopsticks this 
square makes — eggs — ack — ly — on 
the — beat," she stressed flatly. "And 
then a bass player I had, a doghouse complete with dog, and tonedeaf to boot. I booted him. I worked the last three nights without a 
bass, and am I glad you're back!" 

"Me too." He touched her hair. 
"We'll get you a piano player and 
cverything'll riff like Miff." 

"A piano I got," she said, and 
her voice was awed. "Little cat I 
heard in a joint after hours. Gives 
his left hand a push and forgets 



about it. Right hand is crazy. Real 
sad little character, Derek. Gets the 
by-himself blues and plays boogie 
about it. Worse he feels, the better 
he plays. Sing with him? Man! All 
his chords are vocal cords for little 
Janie. He's back there now. Listen 
at him!" 

DEREK listened. The piano back 
there was talking to itself 
about something rich and beautiful 
and lost. "That just one man?" he 
asked after a moment. 

"Come on back and meet him," 
she said. "Oh, Derek, he's a sweetheart." 

"Sweetheart?" 

She thumped his chest and 
chuckled. "Wait till you see him. 
You don't need to lie awake nights 
over him. Come on." 

He was a man with a hawk face 
and peaceful eyes. He huddled on 
the bench watching what his hands 
did on the keyboard as if he hadn't 
seen them before but didn't much 
care. His hands were extraordinarily eloquent. He didn't look up. 

Derek said, "I'm going to go get 
my fiddle." 

He did, and picked up the beat 
so quietly that the pianist didn't 
hear him for three bars. Then he 
looked up and smiled shyly at 
Derek and went on playing. It was 
very, very good. They volleyed an 
intro back and forth for a while 
arid then, before Derek fully realized what they were playing, Janie 
was singing "Thunder and Roses": 



80 




 



"When you gave me your heart 
You gave me the world . . ." 

And, after, there was a chord 
with a tremendous emphasis on an 
added sixth, and then it was augmented — a hungry, hungry leading 
tone, which led, with a shocked 
sort of satisfaction, into silence. 

Derek put by his bass, carefully, 
so it wouldn't make any sound. 

Jane said, in a mouselike voice, 
"I can breathe now?" 

The pianist got up. He was not 
tall. He said, "You're Derek Jax. 
Thanks for letting me play along 
with you. I always wanted to." 

"Thanks, he says." Derek gestured. "You play a whole mess of 
piano. What's your name?" 

"Henry. Henry Faulkner." 

"I never heard of you." 

"He was head of the Orchestration Department at the Institute for 
twelve years," said Jane. 

"Hey? That's all right," said 
Derek. "Symphony stuff. What'd 
you leave for?" 

"Squares," said Henry. To 
Derek, it was a complete explanation. "I'd like to work here." 

Jane closed her eyes and clasped 
her hands. "Yummy." 

Derek said, from a granite face, 
"No." 

JANE stood frozen. Henry came 
out from behind the piano. 
He walked — he all but trotted up 
to Derek. "No? Oh, please! A — 
joke?" 



"No joke. Just no." 

Jane breathed, "Derek, what are 
you on? Goof balls?" 

Derek threw up his hands. "No. 
It's a good word. Ain't 'no' better 
than a whole lot of yak? No, that's 
all." 

"Derek — " 

"Mr. Jax," said Derek. 

"Mr. Jax, please think it over," 
Henry said. "I've Ibeen wanting to 
work with you ever since you recorded 'Slide Down.' You know 
how long ago that was. I don't just 
want to play piano someplace. I 
want to play here — with you. I 
don't care about the pay. Just let 
me back up that bass." 

"He never talked like that to 
me," said Jane with a small smile. 
"You've made yourself a conquest, 
puddinhead. Now — " 

"I don't want to hear that kind 
of talk," exploded Derek. "I don't 
want to hear any kind of talk. I 
said no!" 

Jane came to him. She squeezed 
Henry's forearm and gave him a 
long look. "Walk around some," 
she said kindly. "Come back and 
see me later." 

Derek stood looking at the piano. 
Jane watched Henry go. He walked 
slowly, holding himself in, his head 
forward. At the other side of the 
dance floor he turned and opened 
his mouth to speak, but Jane 
waved him on. He went out. 

Jane whirled on Derek. "Now 
what the God — " 

Derek interrupted her, rasping,

"If you got any more to say about 
this, you can look for a new bass 
man too." 




iAllas Mccormick was 

fifty-three years old and knew 



what she was about. She strode 
briskly down Eleventh Street, a 
swift, narrow figure with pointed 
shoulders and sharp wattles at the 
turn of her thin jaw. It was late 
and the tea room would be closed 
before long. 

Verna was there before her, her 
bright white hair and bright blue 
eyes standing out like beacons in 
the softly lit room. 

"Good evening, Pallas." Verna's 
voice was soft and pillowy, like her 
pudgy face and figure. 

"Evening," said Pallas. Without 
preliminaries she demanded, "How 
are yours?" 

Verna sighed. "Not so well. 
Two are willing, one isn't. The 
little fool." 

"They're all fools," said Pallas. 
"Two billion stupid fools. Never 
heard of such a place." 

"They want to do everything by 
twos," said Verna. "They're all 
afraid they'll lose something if they 
don't pair off, pair off. They've 
been schooled and pushed and ordered and taught that that's the way 
it must be, so — " she sighed 
again — "that's the way it is." 

"We haven't much more time. I 
wish we hadn't lost — " There followed a dim attempt to project 
"Mak," a mental designation for 




82

83 



which there was no audible equivalent. 

"Oh, dear, stop saying that! 
You're always saying that. Our first 
third is gone, all eaten up, and 
that's the way it is." 

"TTTE'RE two," said Pallas causVV tically, "and we don't want 
to be. Are you all right?" 

"Thoroughly encysted, thank 
you. Pa'ak can't get to me. I'm so 
well encased I can barely get 
through to control this — " she lifted her arms and dropped them 
heavily on the table — "this bag of 
bones. And I can't telepath. I wish 
I could communicate with you and 
the others directly, instead of 
through this primitive creature and 
its endless idioms. I've even got to 
use that clumsy terrestrial name of 
yours — there's no vocalization for 
our real ones." Again there was an 
effort to identify the speaker as 
"Myk" and the other as "Mok," 
which failed. 

"/ wish I could get through to 
the others. Goodness! A weak signal once in a while — a mere 'come 
close' or 'go away' — and in between, nothing, for weeks on end." 

"Oh, but they've got to stay 
closed up so tight! You know how 
the Pa'ak infection works — increasing the neurotic potential so that 
the virus can feed on the released 
nervous energy. There are two 
groups of three people who must 
come together by their own free 
emotional merging, or Ril's three 



parts and Kad's three parts can 
never become one again. To allow 
them that emotional freedom is to 
allow the Pa'ak virus which infests 
them to remain active, since they 
tend to be attracted to one another 
for neurotic reasons. At least we 
don't have that much trouble. There 
was so little neurosis or anything 
else left in these minds when we 
took them over that they were poor 
feeding grounds for Pa'ak. And 
that's the — " 

"Verna, can you spare me that 
everlasting — " 

" — the way it is," finished Verna 
inexorably. "I'm sorry, Pallas, 
truly. There's a horrid little pushbutton in this mind that plays that 
phrase off every once in a while no 
matter what I do. I'm rebuilding 
the mind as fast as I can; I'll get to 
it soon. I hope." 

"Verna . . ." said Pallas with an 
air of revelation. "We can speed 
this thing up. I'm sure we can. 
Look. These fools won't group in 
threes. And Ril and Kad can't complete themselves unless their three 
hosts are emotionally ready for it. 
Now then." She leaned forward 
over her teacup. "There's no important difference between two 
groups of three and three groups 
of two." 

"You really think . . . why, 
Pallas, that's a marvelous idea. 
You're so clever, dear! Now, the 
first thing we'll have to — " 

They both froze in an attitude 
of listening. 



84 




 



"My word," said Verna. "That's 
a bad one." 

"I'll go," said Pallas. "That's one 
of the creatures I'm guarding. Ril is 
in it." 

"Shall I come too?" 

"You stay here. I'll take a taxi 
and keep in touch with you. When 
I'm far enough away I'll triangulate. Keep watch for that signal 
again. Goodness! What an urgent 
one!" 

She trotted out. Verna looked 
across at Pallas' untouched teacup. 
"She left me with the check." A 
sigh. "Well, that's the way it is."

DR. JONATHAN PRINCE was 
saying, "The world's never 
been in such a state. Industrialization is something you can graph, 
and you find a geometric increase. 
You can graph the incidence of 
psychoneufoses the same way and 
find almost the same curve, but it's 
a much larger one. I tell you, Edie, 
it's as if something were cultivating our little traumas and anxieties 
like plowed fields to increase their 
yield, and then feeding off them." 

"But so much is being done, 
Jon!" his ex-wife protested. 

Jon waved his empty glass. 
"There are 39,000 psychotherapists 



to how many millions of people 
who need their help? There's a 
crying need for some kind of 
simple, standardized therapy, and 
people refuse to behave either simply or according to standards. Somewhere, somehow, there's a new 
direction in therapy. So-called 
orthodox procedures as they now 
exist don't show enough promise. 
They take too long. If by some 
miracle of state support and streamlined education you could create 
therapists for everyone who needed 
them, you'd have what amounted to 
a nation or a world of full-time 
therapists. Someone's got to bake 
bread and drive buses, you know." 

"What about these new therapies I've been reading about?" Edie 
wanted to know. 

"Oh, they're a healthy sign to a 
certain extent; they indicate we 
know how sick we are. The most 
encouraging thing about them is 
their diversity. There are tools and 
schools and phoneys and fads. 
There's psychoanalysis, where the 
patient talks about his troubles to 
the therapist, and narcosyn thesis, 
where the patient's troubles talk to 
the therapist, and hypnotherapy, 
where the therapist talks to the 
patient's troubles. 

"There's insulin to jolt a man 
out of his traumas and electric 
shock to subconsciously frighten 
him out of them, and CO, to choke 
the traumas to death. And there's 
the pre-frontal lobotomy, the transorbital leukotomy, and the topec

tomy to cut the cables between a 
patient's expression of his aberrations and its power supply, with the 
bland idea that the generator will 
go away if you can't see it any more. 
And there's Reichianism which, 
roughly speaking, identifies Aunt 
Susan, who slapped you, with an 
aching kneecap which, when cured, 
cures you of Aunt Susan too. 

"And there's — but why go on ? 
The point is that the mushrooming 
schools of therapy show that we 
know we're sick; that we're anxious 
— but not yet anxious enough, en 
masse — to do something about it, 
and that we're willing to attack the 
problem on all salients and sectors." 

"What kind of work have you 
been doing recently?" Edie asked. 

"Electro-encephalographics, mostly. The size and shape of brainwave graphs will show a great deal 
once we get enough of them. And 
— did you know there's a measurable change in volume of the fingertips that follows brain-wave incidence very closely in disturbed 
cases? Fascinating stuff. But sometimes I feel it's the merest dull 
nudging at the real problems involved. Sometimes I feel like a 
hard-working contour cartographer 
trying to record the height and 
grade of ocean waves. Every time 
you duplicate an observation to 
check it, there's a valley where there 
was a mountain a second ago. 

"And sometimes I feel that if 
we could just turn and look in the 



right direction, we'd see what's doing it to us, plain as day. Here we 
sit with our psychological bottle of 
arnica and our therapeutic cold 
compresses, trying to cure up an 
attack of lumps on the head bone. 
And if we could only turn and 
look in the right place, there would 
be an invisible maniac with a stick, 
beating us over the head, whom 
we'd never detected before." 

"You sound depressed." 

"Oh, I'm not, really," he said. 
He stood up and stretched. "But I 
almost wish I'd get away from that 
recurrent thought of looking in a 
new direction; of correlating neurosis with a virus disorder. Find the 
virus and cure the disease. It's 
panacea; wishful thinking. I'm 
probably getting lazy." 

"Not you, Jon." His ex-wife 
smiled at him. "Perhaps you have 
the answer, subconsciously, but 
what you've learned won't let it 
come out." 

"T 7ERY astute. What made you 
V say that?" 

"It's a thing you used to say all 
the time." 

He laughed and helped her up. 
"Edie, .do you have to get up early 
tomorrow?" 

"I'm unemployed. Didn't I tell 
you?" 

"I didn't ask," he said ruefully. 
"My God, I talk a lot. Would you 
like to see my new lab?" 

"I'd love to! Oh, I'd love it. 
Will it be— all right?" 



86 




 



"All right? Of course it — oh. I 
see what you mean. Priscilla. Where 
is she, anyway?" 

"She went out. I thought you 
noticed. With that man who plays 
the guitar. Irving." She nodded toward the discarded instrument. 

"I hadn't noticed," he said. Over 
his features slipped the poker expression of the consulting psychologist. "Who did you come with?" 

"The same one. Irving. Jon, I 
hope Priscilla can take care of herself." 

"Let's go," he said.

Faintly, and with exasperation, 
Ril's thought came stumblingly 
through to Ryl and Rul: 

"How can a thinking being be 
so stupid? Have you ever heard a 
more accurate description of the 
Pa'ak virus than that? 'Cultivating 
our little traumas and anxieties like 
plowed fields to increase their yield, 
and then feeding off them.' And 
'a new direction.' Why haven't 
these people at least extrapolated 
the idea of energy life? They know 
that matter and energy are the same. 
An energy virus is such a logical 
thing for them to think of !" 

And Rul's response: "They can 
no more isolate their experiments 
from their neuroses than they can 
isolate their measuring instruments 
from gravity. Have patience. When 
we are able to unite again, we will 
have the strength to inform them." 
Ril sent: "Patience? How much 



more time do you think we have 
before they start to spread the virus 
through this whole sector of the 
cosmos? They are improving rockets, aren't they? We should have 
sent for reinforcements. But then 
— how could we know we'd be 
trapped like this in separate entities which refuse to merge?" 

"We couldn't," Ril answered. 
"We still have so much to learn 
about these creatures. Sending for 
reinforcements would solve nothing." 

"And we have so little time," Rul 
mourned. "Once they leave Earth, 
the Pa'ak pestilence will no longer 
be isolated." 

Ril responded: "Unless they are 
cured of the disease before they 
leave." 

"Or prevented from leaving," 
Ryl pointed out. "An atomic war 
would lower the level of culture. If 
there is no choice, we could force 
them to fight — we have the power 
— and thus reduce their technology 
to the point where space flight 
would be impossible." 

It was a frightening idea. They 
broke contact in trembling silence.

THEY had had a drink, and then 
coffee, and- now Irving was 
leading her homeward. She hadn't 
wanted to go through the park, but 
it was late and he assured her that 
it was much shorter this way. 
"There are plenty of places through 
here where you can cut corners." It

was easier not ' to argue. Irving 
commanded a flood of language at 
low pitch and high intensity that 
she could do without just now. She 
was tired and bored and extremely 
angry. 

It was bad enough that Jon had 
deserted her for that bit of flotsam 
from his past. It was worse that she 
should have walked right past him 
with her hat on without his even 
looking up. What was worst of all 
was that she had let herself be so 
angry. She had no claims on Jonathan Prince. They were more than 
friends, certainly, but not any more 
than that. 

"Who's the girl you came to the 
party with, Irving?" she asked. 

"Oh, her. Someone trying to get 
a job at the plant. She's a real 
bright girl. Electronics engineer — 
can you imagine?" 

"And—" 

HE GLANCED down at her. 
"And what? I found out she 
was a cold fish, that's all." 

Oh, she thought. So you ditched 
her because you thought she was a 
cold fish, and scooped me up. And 
what does that make me? Aloud 
she said, "These paths wind 
around the park so. Are you sure 
it's going to take us out on the 
downtown side?" 

"I know everything about these 
woods." He peered. "This way." 

They turned off the blacktop 
walk and took a graveled path away 
to the right. The path was brilliant


ly lit by a street-lamp at the crossing of the walks, and the light 
followed the path in a straight 
band through the undergrowth. It 
seemed so safe . . . and then Irving 
turned off to still another path. She 
turned with him, unthinking, and 
blinked her eyes against a sudden, 
oppressive darkness. 

It was a small cul de sac, completely surrounded by heavy undergrowth. As her eyes became accustomed to the dim light that filtered 
through the trees, she saw benches 
and two picnic tables. A wonderful, 
secluded, restful little spot, she 
thought — for a picnic. 

"How do you like this?" whispered Irving hoarsely. He sounded 
as if he had been running. 

"I don't," she said immediately. 
"It's late, Irving. This isn't getting 
either of us anywhere." 

"Oh, I don't know," he said. He 
put his arms around her. She 
leaned away from him with her 
head averted, swung her handbag 
back and up at his face. He caught 
her wrist deftly and turned it behind her. 

"Don't," she gasped. "Don't . . •." 

"You've made your little protest 
like a real lady, honey, so it's on 
the record. Now save us some time 
and trouble. Let's get to it." 

She kicked him. He gasped but 
stood solidly. There was a sharp 
click behind her. "Hear that?" he 
said. "That's my switch-blade. 
Push a button and zip! — seven 
inches of nice sharp steel. Now

don't you move or make a sound, 
sweetheart, and this'll be fun for 
both of us." 

Locking her against him with his 
left arm, he reached slowly up under the hem of her short jacket. 
She felt the knife against her back. 
It slipped coldly between her skin 
and the back of her low-cut dress. 
"Don't you move," he said again. 
The knife turned, sawed a little, 
and the back strap of her brassiere 
parted. The knife was removed; she 
heard it click again. He dropped it 
into his jacket pocket. 

"Now," he breathed, "doesn't 
that feel better, lamb-pie?" 

SHE filled her lungs to scream, 
and instantly his hard hand 
was clamped over her mouth. It 
was a big hand, and the palm was 
artfully placed so that she couldn't 
get her mouth open wide enough 
to use her teeth on it. 

"Let's not wrestle," he said, his 
voice really gentle, pleading. "It 
just doesn't make sense. I'd as soon 
kill you as not — you know that." 

She stood trembling violently, 
her eyes rolled up almost out of 
sight. Her mouth sagged open when 
he kissed it. Then he screamed. 

His arms whipped away from 
her and she fell. She lay looking 
dully up at him. He stood straight 
in the dim light, stretched, his face 
up and twisted with pain. He had 
both hands, apparently, on one of 
his back pockets. He whirled around 
and her eyes followed him. 



There was someone else standing 
there . . . someone in black. Someone who looked like a high-school 
teacher Priscilla had once had. Gray 
hair, thin, wattled face. 

Moving without haste but with 
great purpose, the spinsterish apparition stooped, raised her skirts 
daintily and kicked Irving accurately in the groin. He emitted a croaking sound and dropped to a crouch, 
and began a small series of agonized grunts. The old lady stepped 
forward as if she were dancing a 
minuet, put out one sensible shoe 
and shoved. Irving went down on 
his knees and elbows, his head 
hanging. 

"Get out," said the old lady crisply. "Now." She clapped her hands 
once. The sound stiffened Irving. 
With a long, breathy groan he staggered to his feet, turned stupidly 
to get his bearings and hobbled 
rapidly away. 

"Come on, dear." The woman 
got her hands under Priscilla's armpits and helped her up. She halfcarried the girl over to one of the 
picnic tables and seated her on the 
bench. With an arm around Priscilla's shoulders, she held her upright while she put a large black 
handbag on the table. Out of it she 
rummaged a voluminous handkerchief which she thrust into Priscilla's hands. "Now, you sit there 
and cry a while." 

Priscilla said, still trembling, "I 
can't," and burst into tears. 

When it was over she blew her

nose weakly. "I don't . . . know 
what to say to you. I — he would 
have killed me." 

"No, he wouldn't. Not while I'm 
alive and carry a hatpin." 

"Who are you?" 

"A friend. If you'll believe that, 
child, that's good enough for me 
and it'll have to be good enough 
for you." 

"I believe that," said Priscilla. 
She drew a long, shuddering breath. 
"How can I ever thank you?" 

"By paying attention to what I 
tell you. But you must tell me some 
things first. How did you ever get 
yourself mixed up with such an 
animal? You surely have better 
sense than that." 

"T) LEASE don't scold ... I was 

-L silly, that's all." 

"You were in a tizzy, you mean. 
You were, weren't you?" 

"Well," sniffed Priscilla, "yes. 
You see, I work with this doctor, 
and he and I — it isn't anything formal, you understand, but we work 
so well together and laugh at the 
same things, and it's . . . nice. And 
then he — " 

"Go on." 

"He was married once. Years 
ago. And he saw her tonight. And 
he didn't look at me any more. I 
guess I'm foolish, but I got all upset." 

"Why?" 

"I told you. He just wanted to 
talk to her. He forgot I was alive." 
"That isn't why. You were upset 



because you were afraid he'd get 
together with her again." 

"I — I suppose so." 

"Do you want to marry him?" 

"Why, I— I don't .... No, I 
wouldn't. It isn't that." 

The old lady nodded. "You 
think if he married her again — or 
anyone else — that it would make a 
big difference in the work you do 
together, in the way he treats you?" 

"I . . . don't suppose there would 
be any big difference, no," Priscilla 
said thoughtfully. "I'd never 
thought it through." 

"And," continued the old lady 
relentlessly, "have you thought 
through any other possible course 
of action he could have taken tonight? He was married to her for 
some time. He apparently hasn't 
seen her for years. It must have 
been a small shock to him to find 
her there. Now, what else might 
he have done? 'Goodness gracious, 
there's my old used-up wife. Priscilla, let's dance.' Is that what you 
expected?" 

At last she giggled. "You're 
wonderful. And you're right, you 
are so absolutely right. I have been 
sil— Oh!" 

"What is it?" 

"You called me Priscilla. How 
did you know my name? Who are 
you?" 

"A friend. Come along, girl; 
you can't sit here all night." She 
drew the startled girl to her feet. 
"Here, let me look at you. Your 
lipstick's smeared. Over here.

That's better. Can you button that 
jacket? I think perhaps you should. 
Not that it should matter if your 
bust does show, the way you brazen 
things dress nowadays. There now, 
come along." 

She hurried Priscilla through the 
park, and when they reached the 
street, turned north. Priscilla 
tugged at the black sleeve. "Please 
— wait. I live that way." She 
pointed. 

"I know, I know. But you're not 
going home just yet. Come along, 
child!" 

"Where are you — we — going?" 

"You'll see. Now listen to me. 
Do you trust me?" 

"Oh, my goodness, yes !" 

"Very well. When we get where 
we're going, you'll go inside alone. 
Don't worry now, it's perfectly safe. 
Once you're inside you'll do something very stupid indeed." 

"I will?" 

"You will. You'll turn around 
and try to leave. Now, then, I want 
you to understand that you must 
not leave. I shall be standing outside to see that you don't." 

"But I— £ut why? What am I 
supposed . . . where ..." 

"Hush, child ! You do as you're 
told and you'll be all right." 

Priscilla walked along in silence 
for a time. Then she said, "All 
right." The old lady turned to look 
into the softest-smiling, most trusting face she had ever seen. She put 
her arm around Priscilla's shoulders and squeezed. 



"You'll do," she said. 

HENRY FAULKNER sat in a 
booth, far from the bellythumping juke box and the knot of 
people chattering away at the headend of the bar. Henry's elbows were 
on the table and his thumbs, fitted 
carefully into the bony arches over 
his eyelids, supported the weight 
of his head. The cafe went round 
and round like a Czerny etude, but 
with a horizontal axis. The walls 
moved upward in front of him and 
down behind him, and he felt very 
ill. Once he had forced down three 
beers, and that was his established 
capacity; it had bloated him horribly and he'd had a backache in 
the morning. Tonight he'd had four 
double ryes. 

"There he shtood," he said to 
one of the blonde girls who sat 
opposite, "nex' to the conductor, 
watching the orch'stra, an' sometimes he'd beat time wiz arms. 
When the last movement ended, th' 
audience rozhe up as one man an' 
roared. An' there he shtood, nex' 
to the conductor — " 

"You said that before," said the 
girls. They spoke in unison, and 
the pair of them had only one 
voice, like the doubled leading tone 
in a major chord. 

"There he shtood," Henry went 
on, "shtill beating time after the 
music stopped. An' the conductor, 
wi' eyes in his tears — wi' tears in 
his eyes — turned him around so he 
could shee the applause."

"What was the matter with 
him?" asked the girls. 
"He was deaf." 
"Who was?" 

"Beethoven." Henry wept. 

"My God. Is that what you're 
tying one on about?" 

"You said to tell you the sad 
story," said Henry. "You didn't say 
tell you my sad story." 

"Okay, okay. You got money, 
ain't you?" 

Henry lifted his head and reared 
back to get perspective. It was then 
that the girl merged and became 
one; he realized that there had been 
one all along, in spite of what he 
had seen. That explained why they 
both had the same voice. He was 
extravagantly pleased. "Sure I got 
money." 

"Well, come on up to my place. 
I'm tired uh sittin' around here." 

"Very gracious," he intoned. "I 
shall now tell you the sad story of 
my laysted wife." 

"What type wife?" 

"I beg your pardon? I've never 
been married." 

The girl looked perplexed. 
"Start over again." 

"Da capo," he said with his finger beside his nose. "Very well. I 
repeat. I shall now tell you the 
story of my wasted life." 

"Oh," said the girl. 

"I have had the ultimate in rejections," said Henry solemnly. "I 
fell in love, deeply, deeply, deeply, 
dee — " 

"Who with?" said the girl tired


ly. "Get to the point and let's get 
out of here." 

"With a string bass. A bull, as 
it were, fiddle." He nodded solemnly. 

"Ah, fer Pete's sake," she said 
scornfully. She stood up. "Look, 
mister, I can't waste the whole 
night. Are you comin' or ain't 
you?" 

HENRY scowled up at her. He 
hadn't asked for her company. She'd just appeared there in 
the booth. She had niggled and 
nagged until he was about to tell 
her all the things he had come here 
to forget. And now she wanted to 
walk out. Suddenly he was furious. 
He, who had never raised his hand 
or his voice in his whole life, was 
suddenly so angry that he was, for 
a moment, blind. He growled like 
the open D on a bass clarinet and 
leaped at her. His clawed hand 
swept past her fluffy collar and got 
caught, tore the collar a little, high 
on the shoulder. 

She squealed in routine fear. The 
bartender hopped up sitting on the 
bar and swung his thick legs over. 

"What the hell's going on back 
there?" he demanded, pushing 
himself off onto the floor. 

The blonde said, shrilly and indignantly, exactly what she thought 
Henry was trying to do. 

"Right there in the booth?" said 
a bourbon up the row. 

"That I got to see," replied a 
beer. 



92 




 



They started back, followed by 
the rest of the customers. 

The bartender reached into the 
booth and lifted Henry bodily out 
of it. Henry, sick and in a state of 
extreme panic, wriggled free and 
ran — two steps. The side of his 
head met the bridge of the bourbon's nose. Henry was aware of a 
dull crunch. There were exploding 
lights and he went down, rolled, 
got to his feet again. 

The girl was screaming in a 
scratchy monotone somewhere 
around high E flat. The bourbon 
was sitting on the floor with blood 
spouting from his nose. 

"Get 'im!" somebody barked. 

Powerful hands caught Henry's 
thin biceps. A heavy man stood in 
front of him, gigantic yellow mallets of fists raised. 

"Hold him tight," said the heavy 
man. "I'm gonna let him have it." 

And then a sort of puffball with 
bright blue eyes was between Henry 
and the heavy man. In a soft, 
severe voice it said, "Leave him 
alone, you — you bullies! You let 
that man go, this very minute!" 

Henry shook his head. He regretted the movement, but among 
the other things it made him experience was clearing sight. He 
looked at the puffball, which became a sweet-faced lady in her 
fifties. She had gentleness about 
her mouth and sheer determination 
in her crackling blue eyes. 

"You better stay out of this, 
Granny," said the bartender not un


kindly. "This character's got it 
comin' to him." 

"You'll let him go this instant!" 
said the lady, and stamped a small 
foot. "And that's the way it is." 

"Al," said the heavy man to the 
bartender, "just lead this lady off 
to one side while I paste this bastard." 

"Don't you put a hand on me." 

"Watch your language, Sylvan," 
said the bartender to the heavy 
man. He put a hand on the lady's 
shoulder. "Come over her a sec — 
uh!" 

THE final syllable was his staccato response to the old lady's 
elbow in the pit of his stomach. 
That, however, was not the end of 
her — literally — chain reaction. She 
swung her crocus reticule around in 
a full-armed arc and brought it 
down on the heavy man's head. He 
sank to the floor without a whimper. In the same movement she put 
her other hand swiftly but firmly 
against Henry's jaw and pushed it 
violently. His head tipped back and 
smashed into the face of the man 
who stood behind him holding his 
arms. The man staggered backward, tripped, and fell, bouncing 
his skull off an unpadded bar stool. 

"Come along, Henry," said the 
old lady cheerfully. She took him 
by the wrist as if he were a small 
boy whose face needed washing, 
and marched him out of the cafe. 

On the street he gasped, "They'll 
chase us . . ." 



RULE OF THREE 



93 



"Naturally," said the lady. She 
put two fingers into her mouth and 
blew a piercing blast. A block and 
a half away, a parked taxicab slid 
away from the curb and came toward them. There was shouting 
from the cafe. The taxicab pulled 
up beside them. The lady whipped 
the door open and pushed Henry 
in. As four angry men shouldered 
out on the sidewalk, she reached 
deep into her reticule and snatched 
a dark object from it. She stood 
poised for a moment, and in the 
neon-shot half-light Henry saw 
what was in her hand — an oldfashioned, top-of-stove flat iron. 
He understood then why the heavy 
man had drowsed off so readily. 

The lady hefted the iron and let 
it fly. It grazed the temple of one 
of the men and flew straight 
through a plate glass window. The 
man who was hit went to his knees, 
his hands holding his head. The 
other three fell all over each other 
trying to get back out of range. 
The lady skipped into the cab and 
said calmly, "Young man, take us 
away from here." 

"Yes, ma'am!" said the driver in 
an awed tone, and let in his clutch. 

They jounced along in silence 
for a moment, and then she leaned 
' forward. "Driver, pull up by one 
of these warehouses. Henry's going 
to be sick." 

"I'm all right," said Henry 
weakly. The cab stopped. The lady 
• opened the door. "Come along!" 

"No, really, I—" 



94 



The lady snapped her fingers. 

"Oh, all right," said Henry 
sheepishly. In the black shadows by 
the warehouse he protested faintly, 
"But I don't want to foe sick!" 

"I know what's best," she said 
solicitously. She took his hand, 
spread it, and presented him with 
his long middle finger, point first, 
as if it were a' clinical thermometer. 
"Down your throat," she ordered. 

"No!" he said loudly. 

"Are you going to do as you're 
told?" 

He looked at her. "Yes." 

"I'll hold your head," she said. 
"Go on." 

She held his head. 

Afterward, in the cab, he asked 
her timidly if she would take him 
home now. 

"No," she said. "You play the 
piano, don't you, Henry?" 

He nodded. 

"Well, you're going to play for 
me." She reached forcefully into 
her reticule again, and his protest 
died on his trembling lips. "Here," 
she said, and handed him an oldfashioned mint. 



JT She had a "walking-underwater" feeling, as if she were 
immersed in her own reluctance. 
She had trod these stairs many 
times at night — usually downward 
after a perplexing, intriguing series 
of experiments. She did not know 
why she should be returning to the 
laboratory now, except that she had 




mounted the stairs.

been ordered to do so. She freely 
admitted that if it were not for the 
thin, straight figure in black who 
waited downstairs, she would certainly be in bed by now. But there 
was an air of command, of complete certainty about the old lady 
who had saved her that was utterly 
compelling. 

She walked quietly down the carpeted hall. The outer door of the 
lab office was ajar. There was no 
light in the office, but a dim radiance filtered in from the lab itself, 
through the frosted panel of the 
inner door. She crossed to it and 
went in. 

Someone gasped. 

Someone said, "Priscilla!" 

Priscilla said, "Excuse me!" and 
spun around. She shot through the 
office and out into the hall, her 
cheeks burning, her eyes stinging. 
"He — he — " she sobbed, but could 
not complete the thought, would 
not review the picture she had seen. 

At the lower landing she raced 
to the street door, valiantly holding 
back the tears and the sobs that 
would accompany them. Her hand 
went out to the 'big brass doorknob, 
touched it — 

' As the cool metal greeted her 
hand she stopped. 

Outside that door, standing on 
the walk by the iron railings, radiating strength and rectitude, would 
be the old lady. She would watch 
Priscilla come out of the building. 
She would probably nod her head 
in knowledgable disappointment. 



She would doubtless say, "I told 
you you would want to leave, and 
that it would be foolish." 

"But they were — " said Priscilla 
in audible protest. 

Then came the thought of trustfulness: "Listen to me. Do you 
trust me?" 

PRISCILLA took her hand away 
from the knob. She thought 
she heard the murmur of low 
voices upstairs. 

She remembered the talk about 
Jon and his meeting with Edie at 
the party. She remembered herself 
saying, "I — just didn't think it 
through." 

She turned and faced the stairs. 
"I can't, I can't possibly go back. 
Not now. Even if . . . even if it 
didn't make any difference to me, 
they'd . . . they'd hate me. It would 
be a terrible thing to do, to go 
back." 

She turned until the big brass 
knob nudged her hip. Its touch 
projected a vivid picture into her 
mind — the old lady, straight and 
waiting in the lamplight. 

She sighed and started slowly up 
the stairs again. 

When she got to the office this 
time the light was on. She pushed 
the door open. Jon was leaning 
against the desk, watching it open. 
Edie, his ex-wife, stood by the laboratory door, her wide-spaced eyes 
soft and bright. For a moment no 
one moved. Then Edie went to Jon 
and stood beside him, and together 



96 




 



they watched Priscilla with questions on their faces, and something 
like gentle sympathy. Or was it 
empathy ? 

Priscilla came in slowly. She 
went up to Edie and stopped. She 
said, "You're just what he 
needed." 

The wide dark eyes filled with 
tears. Edie put her arms out and 
Priscilla was in them without quite 
knowing which of them had moved. 
When she could, Edie said, "You 
are so lovely, Priscilla. You're so 
very lovely." And Priscilla knew 
she was not talking about her red 
hair or her face. 

Jon put a hand on each of their 
shoulders. "I don't understand 
what's happening here," he said, 
"but I have the feeling that it's 
good. Priscilla, why did you come 
here?" 

She looked at him and said nothing. 

"What made you come back?" 

She shook her head. 

"You know," he smiled, "but 
you're just not talking. You've 
never done a wiser thing than to 
come back. If yt>u hadn't, Edie and 
I would have been driven apart just 
as surely as if you'd used a wedge. 
Am I right, Edie?" 

Edie nodded. "You've made us 
very happy." 

Priscilla felt embarrassed. "You 
are giving me an awful lot of 
credit," she said in a choked voice. 
I "I didn't really do anything. I wish 
I had the — the bigness or wisdom 



you think 1 have." She raised her 
eyes to them. "I'll try to live up 
to it, though. I will . . ." 

The phone rang. 

"Now who could that — " Jon 
reached for it. 

Priscilla took it out of his hand. 
"I'll take it." 

Edie and Jon looked at each 
other. Priscilla said into the phone, 
"Yes . . . yes, it's me. How in the 
world did you . . . Tonight? But 
it's so late! Will you be there? 
Then so will I. Oh, you're wonderful . . . yes, right away." 

She hung up. 

Jon said, "Who was it?" 

Priscilla laughed. "A friend." 

Jon touched her jaw. "All right, 
Miss Mysterious. What's it all 
about?" 

"Will you do something if I ask 
you? You, too, Edie?" 
"Oh, yes." 

Priscilla laughed again. "We do 
have something to celebrate, don't 
we?" When they nodded, she 
laughed again. "Well, come on!" 

IT WAS easier to carry the chopsticks piano-player with Derek 
to help, Jane concluded. She 
watched the rapt faces in the club. 
The house counted good, and it 
was going great, but she couldn't 
help thinking what it would be like 
if Derek hadn't been so pigheaded 
about little Henry. She finished her 
chorus and the piano took it up 
metronomically, nudged on the upbeats by the authoritative beat of 



RULE OF THREE

Derek's bass. She looked at him. 
He was playing steadily, almost absently. His face was sullen. When 
he got absentminded he wasn't 
colossal any more; only terrific. 

The piano moved through an obvious C-sharp seventh chord to 
change key to F-sharp, her key for 
the windup. She drifted into the 
bridge section with a long glissando, and disgust moved into her 
face and Derek's in perfect sychronization as they realized that the 
pianist was blindly going into another 32 bars from the beginning. 

Derek doubled his beat and 
slapped the strings hard, and the 
sudden flurry of sound snapped the 
pianist out of it. Blushing, he recovered the fluff. Jane rolled her 
eyes up in despair and finished the 
number. To scattered applause she 
turned to the piano and said, 
"Tinkle some. Derek and I are going to take ten. And while you're 
tinkling," she added viciously, 
"practice, huh?" 

She smiled at the audience, 
crossed the stand and touched Derek's elbow. "I'm going behind that 
potted palm and flip my lid. Come 
catch it." 

He put his bass out of harm's 
way and followed her into the 
office. She let him pass her and 
slump down on the desk. She 
banged the door. 

"You—" 

He looked at her sullenly. "I 
know what you're going to say. I 
threw out the best ten fingers in 



the business. I told you I don't 
want to talk about it. You don't 
believe that, do you?" 

"I believe it," she said. Her eyes 
glittered. "Derek Jax, I love you." 

"Cut it out." 

"I'm not kidding. I'm not changing the subject, either. I love you 
this much. I'm going to call your 
hand, kid. I love you so much that 
I'm going to make you talk about 
what's with this business of Henry, 
or I'm going to see you walk out 
of here with, and into, your doghouse." 

"That don't make a hell of a lot 
of sense, Janie," he said uncomfortably. 

"No, huh? Listen, the guy I love 
talks to me. I understand him 
enough so he can talk to me. If he 
won't talk to me, it's because he 
thinks I won't understand. I think 
you see what I mean. I love the guy 
I think you are. If you won't talk 
about it, you're just not that guy. 
Maybe that doesn't mean anything 
to you." 

"Could be," he growled. He 
rose and stretched. "Well, guess 
I'll be going. Nice working with 
you, Janie." 

"So long," she said. She went 
and opened the door. 

"By God," he said, "you really 
mean it." 

She nodded. 

HE LICKED his lips, then bit 
them. He sat down. "Shut the 
door, Janie."

She shut the door and put her 
head against it. He flashed her a 
look. "What's the matter?" 

She said hoarsely, "I got something in my eye. Wait." Presently 
she swung around and faced him. 
Her smile was brilliant, her face 
composed. The vein in the side of 
her neck was thick and throbbing. 

"Jane . . ." he said with difficulty, "that Henry — did he ever 
make a pass at you?" 

"Why, you egghead. No! To him 
I'm something that makes music, 
like a saxophone. It's you he's interested in. Hell, did you see his 
face when you came in with your 
bass this afternoon? He'd rather 
play to that bass than go over the 
falls in a barrel with me. If that's 
all that was on your mind, forget 
it." 

"You make it tough for me," he 
said heavily. "I'll play it through 
for you a note at a time. Got a 
stick?" 

She rummaged in the desk 
drawer and found him a cigarette. 
He lit it and dragged until he 
coughed. She had never seen him 
like this. She said nothing. 

He seemed to appreciate that. 
He glanced at her and half his 
mouth flashed part of a smile. Then 
he said, "Did I ever tell you about 
Danny?" 

"No." 

"Kids together. Kids get close. 
He lived down the pike. I got 
caught in a root one time, swimming in a rock quarry. Danny 



seemed to know the instant I got 
tangled. He couldn't swim worth 
a damn, but in he came. Got me 
out, too." 

He dragged on his cigarette, still 
hungry, hot and harsh. The words 
came out, smoking. "There was a 
lot of stuff ... we played ball, we 
run away from home, we broke 
into an oT house and pried loose a 
toilet and threw it out a fourthfloor window onto a concrete walk. 
We done a lot. 

"We jived a lot. He had natural 
rhythm. We used to bang away on 
his ol' lady's piano. I played 
trumpet for a while, but what I 
wanted to do was play string bass. 
I wanted that real bad. 

"We grew up and he moved 
away. Some lousy job trying to 
learn cabinet-making. Saw him a 
couple times. Half-starved, but real 
happy. I was playing bass by then, 
some. Had to borrow a fiddle. 
Wanted my own instrument so bad, 
never had the money. So one day 
he called me up Ions distance. 
Come over. I didn't have no trainfare, so I hitchhiked. Met him at a 
barrelhouse joint in town. He was 
real excited, dragged me out to his 
place. A shack — practically a 
shanty. When we got in sight of it 
he started to run. It was on iire." 

DEREK closed his eyes and 
went on talking. "We got to 
it and it was pretty far gone. I got 
there first. One wall was gone. Inside everything was burning. 



, RULE OF THREE 



99 



Danny, he — he screamed like a 
stung kid. He tried to jump inside. 
I hung on to him. Was much bigger' n him. Then I saw it — a string 
bass. A full-size string bass, burning up. I sat on Danny and watched 
it burn. I knew why he'd moved 
out of town. I knew why he cook 
up cabinet-making. I knew why he 
was so hungry an' — an' so happy. 
Made the box with his own two 
hands. We watched it burn and he 
tried to fight me because I would 
not let him save it. He cried. Well 
— we cried. Just two kids." 

Jane said a single, unprintable 
word with a bookful of feeling behind it. 

"We got over it. We roomed together after that. We done everything together. Crowd we ran with 
used to kid us about it, and that 
just made it better. I guess we were 
about nineteen then." 

He squeezed out a long breath 
and looked up at her with stretched, 
blind eyes. "We had something, 
see? Something clean and big that 
never happened before, and wasn't 
nothing wrong with it. 

"Then I come home one night 
and he's at the back window staring into the yard. Said he was moving out. Said we weren't doing each 
other any good. He was in bad 
shape. Somebody'd been talking to 
him, some lousy crumb with a 
sewer mouth and sewer ideas. I 
didn't know what it was all about. 
We were still just kids, see? 

"Anyway, I couldn't talk him out 



out of it. He left. He was halfcrazy, all eaten up. Like the time 
we watched the bull-fiddle burn up. 
He wouldn't say what was the trouble. So after he went I milled 
around the joint trying to make 
sense out of it and I couldn't. Then 
I—" 

Derek's voice seemed to desert 
him. He coughed hard and got it 
back. " — Then I went and looked 
out the window. Somebody'd wrote 
our names on the fence. Drew a 
heart around 'em. 

"I never gave a damn what anyone thought, see? But Danny, he 
did. I guess you can't know how 
someone else feels, but you can get 
a pretty fair idea. First I was just 
mad, and then I pretended I was 
Danny looking at a thing like that, 
and I got an idea how bad it was. I 
ran out lookin' for him. 

"Saw him after a time. Up by 
the highway, staggering a bit like 
he was half-soused. He wasn't, 
though. I ran after him. He was 
waiting for the light to change. 
There was a lot of traffic. Tried to 
get to him. Couldn't begin to. He 
sort of pitched off the curb right 
under oh my God I can still see it 
the big dual wheel it run right over 
his head . . ." he finished in a rapid 
monotone. 

JANE put her hand on his shoulder. Derek said, "I didn't know 
then and I don't know now and I 
never will know if he was so tore 
up and sick he just fell, or if he 



100 




 



done it on purpose. All I know is 
I've lived ever since with the idea 
I killed him just by being around 
him so much. Don't try to talk me 
out of it. I know it don't make 
sense. I know all the right answers. 
But knowing don't help. 

"That's the whole story." 

Jane waited a long time and then 
said gently, "No, Derek." 

He started as if he had suddenly 
found himself in an utterly strange 
place. Gradually his sense of presence returned to him and he wiped 
his face. 

"Yeah," he said. "Your boy 
Henry. Danny — he played piano, 
Janie. I started with him. Danny 
played piano like nothing that ever 
lived except this Henry. Everything 
I ever drug out of a string bass was 
put in there first by the way he 
played piano. He used to sit and 
play like that and every once in a 
while grin at me. Shy. 

"So I walk in here on a guy 
playing that kind of piano and he 
grins shy like that when he plays, 
and besides, here's that real close 
stuff around him like a fog. That 
Henry's a genius, Janie. And he's 
a — he's the type of guy they ought 
to use for a mold to make people 
out of. And he just wants to be 
near my fiddle. And me. And you 
want me to keep him around here 
until he knocks hisself off. 

"Janie," he said, with agony in 
his voice, "I'm not goin' through 
that again!" 

Jane squeezed his shoulder. She 



looked back over the afternoon and 
evening and words flitted through 
her mind: "You won't have to lose 
any sleep over him" . . . "Looks 
like you've made a conquest" . . . 
"Did he ever make a pass at you?" 
Aloud she told him, "I've sure said 
all the right things . . . take a swing 
at me, pudd'nhead." 

Derek pulled her hand close 
against his cheek and pressed it 
there so hard it hurt her. She let 
him do it as long as he wanted. "I 
love you, Janie," he whispered. "I 
shoulda told you all that about 
Danny a long time ago." 

"How could you tell till you 
tried?" she asked huskily. "Let's go 
on out there before oT Kitten on 
the Keys drives all the customers 
away." 

<<T CAN'T go in there," said 
-L Henry Faulkner in genuine 
panic. 

"You can and you will," said the 
old lady firmly. 

"Listen, there's a man in there 
who'll throw me out on sight." 

"Have I been wrong yet? This 
is your night to do as you're told, 
young man, and that's the way it 
is." 

In spite of himself he grinned. 
They went in through the herculite 
doors. Janie was just finishing a 
number. The piano fluffed the last 
chorus badly. Henry and the old 
lady stood in the back of the club 
until Derek and Jane walked off 
the floor. 



RULE OF THREE 



10T 



"Now," she said briskly, "go on 
up there and play for me. Play 
anything you want to." 

"But they have a piano player!" 

"He's in a pet. Just go up there." 

"Wh-what'll I say to him?" 

"Don't say anything, silly! Just 
stand there. He'll go away." 

He hesitated, and the lady gave 
him a small shove. He shambled 
around the dance floor and diffidently approached the piano. 

The pianist was playing a dingdong version of Stardust. He saw 
Henry coming. "You again." 

Henry said nothing. 

"I suppose you want to take my 
job again." 

Henry still said nothing. The 
man went on playing. Presently, 
"You can have it. How anyone can 
work with a couple sourpusses like 
that . . ." He got off the stool in 
mid-chorus, leaving Stardust's garden gate musically ajar. Henry's 
right hand shot out and, catching 
the chord as if it had been syncopated instead of shut off, began 
molding it like a handful of soft 
clay. He sat down still playing. 

EDIE said, "1 can't help feeling 
a little peculiar. This is wonderful, so wonderful — but there 
are still two of us and one of you." 

"Three of us," corrected Priscilla. 

"In some ways that's so," said 
Jon. He swallowed the rest of his 
drink and beckoned the waiter. 
"Pris is the best statistician and 



psychological steno I've ever run 
across. And you're a genius with 
the machines. Why, between us we 
will do research that'll make history." 

"Of course we will. But — isn't 
three a crowd ?" 

Priscilla said, without malice, 
"From anyone but you I'd consider 
that a hint. Don't worry about me. 
I have the most wonderful feeling 
that the miracles aren't finished." 

"Pris, are you ever going to tell 
us about the miracles?" 

"I don't know, Jon. Perhaps." 
Her eyes searched the club. Suddenly they fixed on a distant corner 
table. "There she is!" 

"Who?" Jon twisted around. 
"Well, I'll be damned!" 

"What is it?" asked Edie. 

"Excuse me," said Jon, and rose. 
"Someone I've got to see." He 
stalked over to the corner table and 
glowered down at its occupants. 
"May I ask what you're doing 
here?" 

"Why, Dr. Prince!" said Pallas. 
"Imagine meeting you here!" 

"What are you two doing here 
at this time of night?" 

"We can go where we like," said 
Verna, smoothing her snowy hair, 
"and that's the way it is." 

. "We're not due to report to you 
until the day after tomorrow," said 
Pallas self-righteously. 

"There's no law against a lady 
having a spot at bedtime," amended Verna. 

"You two never cease to amaze 



102 




 



me," Jon said, chuckling in spite 
of himself. "Just be careful. I'd 
hate to see my prize exhibits get 
hurt.'* 

They smiled up at him. "We'll 
be all right. We'll talk to you again 
later, won't we, Verna?" 

"Oh, yes," said Verna. "Definitely. That's the way it is." 

STILL chuckling, Jon went back 
to his table. "There sits the 
damnedest pair of human beings 
I've encountered yet," he said as he 
sat down. "Three years ago they 
were senile psychotics, the two of 
them. As far as I can determine 
they had no special therapy — they 
were in the County Home, and as 
mindless as a human being can get 
and stay alive. First thing you know 
they actually started feeding themselves- — " 

"Pallas and Verna!" said Priscilla. "You've mentioned — holy 
Pete! Are you sure?" 

"Of course I'm sure. I'm on the 
Board out there. You know the case 
history. They have to report to me 
every sixty days." 

"Well— I— will— be— damned," 
Priscilla intoned, awed. 

"What is it, Pris? I didn't think 
you'd ever seen them. They've never 
been to the lab . . . Say, how did 
you recognize them just now?" 

"Could . . . could you bring them 
over?" 

"Oh, come now. This celebration 
is only for — " 

"I've heard enough to be curious 



about them," said Edie. "Do invite 
them, Jon." 

He shrugged and returned to the 
other table. In a moment he was 
back with the two spinsters. He 
drew out chairs for them in courtly 
fashion, and called a waiter. Pallas 
ordered a double rye, no chaser. 
Verna smiled like a kitten and ordered scotch on the rocks. "For our 
colds," she explained. 

"How long have you had colds?" 
he demanded professionally. 

"Oh, dear, we don't get colds," 
explained Verna sweetly. "That's 
because we drink our liquor 
straight." 

Dr. Jonathan Prince felt it within him to lay down the law at this 
point. A patient was a patient. But 
there was something in the air that 
prevented it. He found himself 
laughing again. He thought he saw 
Pallas wink at Priscilla and shake 
her head slightly, but he wasn't 
sure. He introduced the girls. Without the slightest hesitation he introduced Edie as "my wife." She 
colored and looked pleased. 

"Listen to that music," breathed 
Priscilla. 

"Thought you'd notice it," said 
Pallas, and smiled at Verna. 

They all listened. It was a modal, 
moody, rhythmic invention, built 
around a circle of chords in the 
bass which beat, and beat, and beat 
on a single sonorous tone. The 
treble progressed evenly, regularly, 
tripped up on itself and ran giggling around and through the steady 



RULE OF THREE 



103 



structure of the bass modulations, 
then sobered and marched again, 
but always full of suppressed mirth. 

Priscilla was craning her neck. "I 
can't see him!" 

Verna said, "Why don't you go 
up there, dear? I'm sure he would 
not mind." 

"Oh . . . really not?" She caught 
Pallas's eye. Pallas gave her one 
firm nod. Priscilla said, "Do you 
mind?" She slipped out of her chair 
and went up past the dance floor. 

"Look at her," breathed Edie. 
"She's got that — that 'miracle' expression again . . . Oh, Jon, she's 
so lovely." 

Jon said, looking at the spinsters, 
"What are you two hugging each 
other about?" 

HENRY looked up from the keyboard and smiled shyly. 
"Hello," Priscilla said. 
"Hello." He looked at her face, 
her hair, her body, her eyes. His 
shyness was there, and no boldness 
was present; he looked at her the 
way she listened to his music. It 
was personal and not aggressive. 
He moved over on the bench. "Sit 
down." 

Without hesitation she did. She 
looked at him, too — the hawk profile, the gentle gray-green eyes. 
"You play beautifully." 

"Listen." 

He played with his eyes on her 
face. His hands leaped joyfully like 
baby goats. Then they felt awe and 
hummed something. Henry stopped 



playing by ear. He began to sightread. 

Note followed note followed 
note for the line of her nose, and 
doubled and curved and turned 
back for her nostrils. The theme 
became higher and fuller and 
rounded and there was her forehead, and then there were colorful 
waves up and back for her hair. 
Here was a phrase for an earlobe, 
and one for the turn of the cheek, 
and now there were mysteries, two 
of them, long and subdued and 
agleam and end-tilted, and they 
were her eyes . . . 

DEREK came out of the office 
and stopped so abruptly that 
Jane ran into him. Before she could 
utter the first startled syllable, her 
breath was taken away in a great 
gasp. 

Derek turned and gestured at the 
music. "You — " 

She looked up at him, the furious 
eyes, the terrified trembling at the 
corners of his mouth. "No, Derek, 
so help me God, I didn't ask him 
to come back. I wouldn't do that, 
Derek. I ivouldn't." 

"You wouldn't," he agreed gently. "I know it, hon. I'm sorry. But 
out he goes." He strode out to the 
stand. Jane trotted behind him, and 
when they turned the corner she 
caught his arm so violently that her 
long fingernails sank into his flesh. 
"Watt!" 

There was a girl on the bench 
with Henry, and as he played he 



104 




 



stared at her face. His eyes moved 
over it, his own face moved closer. 
His hands made music like the almost visible current which flowed 
between them. Their lips touched. 

There was a tinkling explosion 
of sound from the piano that built 
up in fullness and sonority until 
Jane and Derek all but blinked 
their eyes, as if it were a blaze of 
light. And then Henry's left hand 
picked up a theme, a thudding, joyous melody that brought the few 
late-owls, in the club right to their 
feet. He no longer looked at the 
girl. His eyes were closed, and his 
hands spoke of himself and what 
he felt — a great honest hunger and 
new riches, a shy and willing experience with a hitherto undreamedof spectrum of sensation. 

Jane and Derek looked at each 
other with shining eyes. Jane said, 
deliberately, "Son, you got a rival," 
and Derek laughed in sheer relieved delight. 

"I'm going to get my fiddle," he 
said. 

When Derek started to play, four 
people left their table and came up 
to the piano as if cables drew them. 
Hand in hand, Jon and Edie 
stopped close by Priscilla and stood 
there, rapt as she. Pallas and Verna 
stood at the other end of the bench, 
their eyes glowing. 

And out of the music, out of the 
bodies that fell into synchronization with the masterful pulse of the 
great viol, came a union, a blending 
of forces from each of six people. 



Each of the six had a part that was 
different from all of the others, but 
the shape of them all was a major 
chord, infinitely complete and completely satisfying. 

«T>IL!" 

J.V "Oh, make it formal, KadKedKud !" 

"RilRylRul, then . . ." 

"If only Mak were here." 

"Myk is with us, and Muk. Poor 
partial things, and how hard they 
have worked, guarding and guiding 
with those pitifully inadequate human bodies as instruments. Come, 
Ril; we must decide. Now that we 
can operate fully, we can investigate these creatures." 

Just as they had investigated, 
compared, computed and stored 
away observations on industrial 
techniques, strength of materials, 
stress and temperature and power 
and design, so now they took instant.and total inventory of their 
hosts. 

RilRylRul found classicism and 
inventiveness, tolerance and empathy in Henry. In Derek were loyalty and rugged strength and a 
powerful interpretive quality. In 
Jane was the full-blown beauty of 
sensualism and directive thought, 
and a unique stylization of the 
products of artistic creation. 

KadKedKud separated and analyzed a splendid systematization in 
Priscilla, a superior grasp of applied theory in Edie, and in Jon 
that rarest of qualities, the asso


RULE OF THREE 



105 



ciative mind — the mind that can 
bridge the specialties. 

"A great race," said Ril, "but a 
sick one, badly infected with the 
Pa'ak pestilence." 

"The wisest thing to do," reflected Kad, "would be to stimulate the virus to such an extent that 
humanity will impose its own quarantine — by reducing itself to savagery through atomic warfare. 
There is such a great chance of 
that, no matter what we do, that it 
would seem expedient to hasten the 
process. The object would be to 
force atomic warfare before space 
travel can begin. That at least would 
keep the virus out of the Galaxy, 
which is what we came here to 
effect." 

"It's a temptation," conceded 
Ril. "And yet — what a tremendous 
species this human race could be! 
Let us stay, Kad. Let us see what 
we can do with them. Let us move 
on to other human groups, . now 
that we know the techniques of 
entry and merging. With just the 
right pressure on exactly the right 
points, who knows? Perhaps we 
can cause them to discover how-to 
cure themselves." 

"It will be a close race," worried Kad. "We can do a great deal, 
but can we do it soon enough? We 
face three possibilities: Mankind 
may destroy itself through its own 
sick ingenuity; it may reach the 
Stars to spread its infection; or it 
may find its true place as a healthy 
species in a healthy Cosmos. I 



would not predict which is more 
likely." 

"Neither would I," Ril returned. 
"So if the forces are that closely 
balanced, I have hope for the one 
we join. Are you with me?" 

"Agreed. Myk — Muk . . . will 
you join us?" 

Faintly, faintly came the weak 
response of the two paltry parts of 
a once powerful triad: "Back in our 
sector we would be considered 
dead. Here we have a life, and 
work. Of course we will help." 

So they considered, and, at 
length, decided. 

And their meeting and consideration and decision took four microseconds. 

THE six people looked at one another, entranced, dazed. 
"It's — gone," said Jon. He wondered, then, what he meant by 
that. 

Henry's fingers slid off the keys, 
and the big bass was silent. Priscilla opened her tilted eyes wide 
and looked about her. Edie pressed 
close to Jonathan, bright-faced, 
composed. Jane stood with her head 
high, her nostrils arched. 

They felt as if they were suddenly living on a new plane of existence, where colors were more vivid 
and the hues between them more 
recognizable. There was a new richness to the air, and a new strength 
in their bodies; but most of all it 
was as if a curtain had been lifted 



106 




 



from their minds for the first time 
in their lives. They had all reached 
a high unity, a supreme harmony 
in the music a second before, but 
this was something different, infinitely more complete. "Cured" was 
the word that came to Jonathan. 
He knew instinctively that what he 
now felt was a new norm, and that 
it was humanity's birthright. 

"My goodness gracious!" 

Verna and Pallas stood close together, like two frightened birds, 
darting glances about them and 
.twittering. 

"I can't think what I'm doing 
here," said Pallas blankly, yet 
aware. "I've had one of my 
spells . . ." 

"We both have," Verna agreed. 
"And that's the way it is." 

Jonathan looked at them, and 
knew them instantly as incomplete. 

He raised his eyes to the rest of 
the people in the club, still stirring 
with the final rustle of applause 
from the magnificent burst of music they had heard, and he recognized them as sick. His mind 
worked with a new directiveness 
and brilliance to the causes of their 
sickness. 



He turned to Edie. "We have 
work to do . . ." 

She pressed his hand, and Priscilla looked up and smiled. 

Derek and Jane looked into each 
other's eyes, into depths neither 
had dreamed of before. There 
would be music from that, they 
knew. 

Henry said, with all his known 
gentleness and none of the frightened diffidence, "Hey, you with the 
red hair. I love you. What's your 
name?" And Priscilla laughed with 
a sound like wings and buried her 
face in his shoulder.

kind of partnership of three.
