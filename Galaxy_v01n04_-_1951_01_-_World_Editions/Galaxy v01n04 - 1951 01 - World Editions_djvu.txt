Old 



Business and New 



IN THIS issue, you can see the 
changes that you, the readers, 
have voted for: 

• 50% more illustrations, and 
several new artists. 

• Shorter book review. 

• Article skipped this month, with 
others scheduled every other issue 
or so. General subjects, of course, 
in layman's terms. 

• A short editorial page, discussing 
matters related directly to 
. 

• Next month's contents page in 
place of a formal forecast. I'd like 
to keep it in the same spot every 
issue, but that takes mechanical layout, and nobody is ever going to be 
able to accuse GALAXY of that. 

• Constant improvement. Several 
readers have commented that GALAXY started at a level that other 
magazines hope to attain. (Their 
italics, not mine.) But magazines, 
like civilizations, must advance or 
decline; there is no possibility of 
stasis. 

This issue, for example, is better, 
in my opinion, than any of the 
previous three . . . better in editorial 
balance, art, and layout, a direct result of close and sympathetic collaboration between editor and 
reader. 



The maintenance of this level is 
not easy, of course. Any number 
of usable stories come in that don't 
have the strong . characterization, 
the human conflict, the psychological suspense that are coming to be 
identified with GALAXY Science 
Fiction, and must thus be rejected. 
Others have those qualities and not 
freshness of theme. The right blend 
was a rarity to begin with, but it is 
becoming less so as authors with 
integrity recognize the objectivestories with believable characters, 
human motivations against a 
background of shrewd speculation. 

Appearing in GALAXY, in 
other words, is a distinction that 
authors are willing to work hard to 
achieve. The result is progressively 
better issues. 

Next month, by way of proof, 
we have "The Fireman" by RAY 
BRADBURY, a 25,000 word 
story of immense impact — a hypnotic cover by CHESLEY BONESTELL — the second installment of 
"Tyrann" by ISAAC ASIMOV— 
short stories by FRITZ LEIBER, 
LESTER DEL REY and others. 

After that? Well, GALAXY has 
kept improving, hasn't it?

CHAPTER I 

The Bedroom Murmured 

THE bedroom murmured 
gently to itself. It was almost below the limits of 
hearing; an irregular little sound, 



yet quite unmistakable and deadly. 

But it wasn't that which awakened Biron Farrill and dragged 
him out of a heavy, unrefreshing 
slumber. He turned his head restlessly from side to side in a futile 
struggle against the periodic burr 
on the end table. 



TYRANN

He put out a clumsy hand without opening his eyes and dosed 
contact. 

"Hello," he mumbled. 

Sound tumbled instantly out of 
the receiver. It was harsh and loud, 
but Biron lacked the ambition to 
reduce the volume. 

It said, "May I speak to Biron 
Farrill?" 

Biron said, fuzzily, "Speaking. 
What do you want?" 

"May I speak to Biron Farrill?" 
The voice was urgent. 

Biron's eyes opened on the thick 
darkness. He became conscious of 
the dry unpleasantness of his 
tongue and the faint odor that remained in the room. 

He said, "I'm Biron Farrill. Who 
is this?" 

It went on, disregarding him, 
gathering tension, a loud voice in 
the night: "Is anyone there? I 
would like to speak to Biron Farrill." 

Biron raised himself on one elbow and stared at the place where 
the visiphone sat. He jabbed at the 
vision control and the small screen 
was alive with light. 

"Here I am," he said. He recognized the smooth, slightly asymmetric features of Sander Jonti.' 
"Call me in the morning, Jonti." 

He started to turn the instrument 
off, when Jonti said, "Hello. Hello. 
Is anyone there? Is this University 
Hall, room 526? Hello." 

Biron was suddenly aware that 
the tiny pilot-light which would 



have indicated a live sending-circuit was not on. He swore under 
his breath and pushed the switch. 
It stayed off. Then Jonti gave up, 
and the screen went blank, and 
was merely a small square of featureless light. 

Biron turned it off. He hunched 
his shoulder and tried to burrow 
into the pillow again. He was 
annoyed. In the first place, no one 
had the right to yell at him in the 
middle of the night. He looked 
quickly at the gently luminous figures just over the headboard. 
Three-fifteen. House lights would 
not go on for nearly four hours. 

Besides, he didn't like having to 
wake to the complete darkness of 
his room. Four years' custom had 
not hardened hiiTT to the Earthman's habit of building structures 
of reinforced concrete, squat, 
thick, and windowless. It was a 
many-thousand-year-old tradition 
dating from the days when the 
primitive nuclear bomb had not 
yet been countered by the Forcefield- defense. 

But that was all in the past. 
Atomic warfare had done its worst 
to Earth. Most of it was hopelessly 
radioactive and useless. There was 
nothing left to lose, and yet architecture mirrored the old fears, so 
that when Biron woke, it was to 
pure darkness. 

BIRON rose on his elbow again. 
That was strange. He waited. 
It wasn't the fatal murmur of the 



6 




 



bedroom he had become aware of. 
It was something perhaps even less 
noticeable and less deadly. 

He missed the gentle movement 
of air that one took so for granted, that trace of continuous renewal. He tried to swallow easily 
and failed. The atmosphere seemed 
to become oppressive even as he 
realized the situation. The ventilating system had stopped working, 
and now he really had a grievance. 
He couldn't even use the visiphone 
to report the matter. 

He tried again to make sure. 
The milky square of light sprung 
out and threw a faint, pearly luster 
on the bed. It was receiving, but 
it wouldn't send. Well, it wasn't 
important. Nothing would be done 
about it before day, anyway. 

He yawned and groped for his 
slippers, rubbing his eyes with the 
heels of his palms. No ventilation, 
eh? That would account for the 
queer smell. He frowned and 
sniffed sharply two or three times. 
No use. It was familiar, but he 
couldn't place it. 

He made his way to the bathroom, reached automatically for the 
light switch, although he didn't 
really need it to draw himself a 
glass of -water. It closed uselessly. 
He tried it several times, peevishly. Wasn't anything working? He 
shrugged, drank in the dark, and 
felt better. He yawned again on 
his way back to the bedroom where 
he tried the main switch. All the 
lights were out. 



Biron sat on the bed, placed his 
large hands on his hard-muscled 
thighs and considered. Ordinarily, 
a thing like this would call for a 
nasty discussion with the service 
staff. No one expected hotel service in a college dormitory, but, by 
Space, there were certain minimum 
standards of efficiency one could 
demand. Not that it was of vital 
importance just now. Graduation 
was coming and he was through. 
In three days, he'd be saying a last 
good-by to the room and to the 
University of Earth; to Earth itself. 

Still, he might report it anyway, 
withput particular comment. He 
could go out and use the hall 
phone. They might bring in a selfpowered light or even rig up a 
fan so he could sleep without psychosomatic choking sensations. If 
not, to Space with them. Two more 
nights. 

IN THE light of the visiphone, 
he located a pair of shorts. 
He slipped a one-piece jumper over 
it and decided that that would be 
enough for the purpose. He retained his slippers. There was no 
danger of waking anybody even if 
he clumped down the corridors in 
spiked shoes, considering the thick, 
nearly soundproof partitions of this 
concrete pile, but he saw no point 
in changing. 

He strode toward the door and 
pulled at the lever. It descended 
smoothly and he heard the click 
that meant the door release had 



TYRANN 



7 



been activated. Except that it 
wasn't. And although his biceps 
tightened as he pulled harder, 
nothing was accomplished. 

He stepped away. This was 
ridiculous. Had there been a general power failure? There couldn't 
have been. The clock was going. 
The visiphone was still receiving 
properly. 

Wait! It could have been the 
beys, bless their erratic souls. It 
was done sometimes. Infantile, of 
course, but he'd taken part in these 
foolish practical jokes himself. It 
wouldn't have been difficult, for 
instance, for one of his buddies to 
sneak in during the day and 
arrange matters. Well, no, the ventilation and lights had been working when he went to sleep. 

VERY well, then, during the 
night. The Hall was an old, 
outmoded structure. It wouldn't 
have taken an engineering genius 
to hocus the lighting and ventilation circuits. Or to jam the door, 
either. And now they would wait 
for morning and see what would 
happen when good old Biron found 
he couldn't get out. They would 
probably let him out toward noon 
and laugh very hard. 

"Ha, ha," said Biron, grimly, 
under his breath. All right, if that's 
the way it was. But he would have 
to do something about it; turn the 
tables somehow. 

He turned away and his toe 
kicked something which skidded 



metallically across the floor. He 
just made out its shadow move 
through the dim visiphone light. 
He reached under the bed, patting 
the floor in a wide arc. He brought 
it out and held it close to the light. 

"They weren't so smart," he 
said. "They should have put the 
visiphone entirely out of commission, instead of just yanking out 
the sending-circuit." 

He found himself holding a 
small cylinder with a little hole in 
the blister on top. He put it close 
to his nose and sniffed at it. That 
explained the smell in the room, 
anyway. It was Hypnite. Of course, 
the boys would have had to use it 
to keep them from waking him up 
while they were busy with the circuits. 

Biron could reconstruct the proceedings step by step now. The 
door had been jimmied open, a 
simple thing to do, and the only 
dangerous part since he might have 
wakened then. The door might 
have been prepared during the day, 
as a matter of fact, so that it would 
seem to close and not actually do 
so. He hadn't tested it. Anyway, 
once it was open, a can of Hypnite would be put just inside and 
the door would be closed again. 
The anesthetic would leak out 
slowly, building up to the one particle in ten thousand of air- necessary to put him definitely under. 
Then they could enter; masked, of 
course. Space! A wet handkerchief 
would keep out the Hypnite for 



8 




 



fifteen minutes and that would be 
al! the time needed. 

It explained the ventilation system situation. That had to be eliminated to keep the Hypnite from 
dispersing too quickly. That would 
have gone first, in fact. The visiphone elimination kept him from 
getting help; the door- jamming 
kept him from getting out; and 
the absence of lights in order to 
induce panic. Nice kids! 

Biron snorted. It was socially 
impossible to be thin-skinned about 
this. A joke was a joke and all 
that. Ha-ha! Right now, he would 
have liked to break the door down 
and have done with it. The welltrained muscles- of his torso tensed 
at the thought, but it would be 
useless.. The door had been built 
with atom-blasts in mind. Damn 
that tradition! 

But there had to be some way 
out. He couldn't let them get away 
with it. First, he would need a 
light; a real one, not the immovable and unsatisfactory glow of the 
visiphone. That was no problem. 
He had a self-powered flashlight in 
the clothes closet. 

For a moment, as he fingered the 
closet door controls, he wondered 
if they had jammed that, too. But 
it moved open naturally, and slid 
smoothly into its wall socket. Biron 
nodded to himself. It made sense. 
There was no reason, particularly, 
to jam the closet, and they didn't 
have too much time, anyway. 

And then, with the flashlight in 



his hand, as he was turning away, 
the entire structure of his theory 
collapsed in a horrible instant. He 
stiffened, his abdomen ridging 
with tension and held his breath, 
listening. 

For the first time since awakening, he heard the murmuring of 
the bedroom. He heard the quiet, 
irregular chuckling conversation it 
was holding with itself, and recognized the nature of the sound at 
once. 

It was impossible not to recognize it. The sound was "Earth's 
death-rattle." It was the sound that 
had been invented several thousand 
years before. 

To be exact, it was the sound of 
a radiation counter, ticking off the 
charged particles and the hard 
gamma waves that came its way, 
the soft clicking electronic surges 
melting into a low murmur. It was 
the sound of a counter, counting 
the only thing it could count — 
death ! 

• 

QOFTLY, on tiptoe, Biron backaway. From a distance of 
six feet he threw the white beam 
into the recesses of the closet. The 
counter was there, in the far corner, but seeing it told him nothing. 

It had been there ever since his 
freshman days. Most freshmen 
from the Outer Worlds bought a 
counter during their first week on 
Earth. They were very conscious of 
Earth's radioactivity then, and felt 
the need of protection. Usually, 



TYRANN

they were sold again to the next 
class, but Biron had never disposed 
of his. He was thankful for that 
now. 

He turned to the desk, where he 
kept his wristwatch while sleeping. It was there. His hand was 
shaking a little as he held it up to 
the flashlight's beam. The watch 
strap was an interwoven flexible 
plastic of an almost liquidly smooth 
whiteness. But was it still white? 
He held it away and tried it at 
different angles. It was white. 

That strap had been another 



Hfll

freshman purchase. Hard radiation 
turned it blue, and blue on Earth 
was the color of death. It was easy 
to wander into a patch of radiating soil during the day if you were 
lost or careless. The government 
fenced off as many areas as it could, 
and, of course, no one ever approached the huge lethal sections 
that began several miles outside 
the city. But the strap was insurance. 

If it should ever turn a faint 
blue, you would show up at the 
hospital for treatment. There was 
no argument about it. The compound of which it was made was 
precisely as sensitive to radiation 
as you were and appropriate photoelectric instruments could be used 
to measure the intensity of the 
blueness so that the seriousness of 
the case might be determined 
quickly. 

A bright royal blue was the finish. Just as the color would never 
change back, neither would you. 
There was no cure, no chance, no 
hope. You just waited anywhere 
from a day to a week, and all the 
hospital could do was to make final 
arrangements for cremation. 

But at least it was still white, 
and some of the clamor in Biron's 
thoughts subsided. 

There wasn't much radioactivity 
then. Could it be just another angle 
of the joke? -Biron considered and 
decided that it couldn't. Nobody 
would do that to anyone else. Not 
on Earth, anyway, where illegal 



TYRANN 



II 



handling of radioactive material 
was a capital offense. They took 
radioactivity seriously here. They 
had to. Nobody, therefore, would 
do this without overpowering 
reason. 

He stated the thought to himself carefully and explicitly, facing 
it boldly. The overpowering reason, 
for instance, of a desire to murder. 
But why? There could be no motive.. In his twenty-three years' of 
life, he had never made a serious 
enemy. Not this serious. Not murder serious. 

He tugged despairingly at his 
clipped hair. This was a ridiculous 
line of thought, but there was no 
escaping it. He stepped cautiously 
back to the closet. There had to be 
something there that was sending 
out radiation, something that had 
not been there four hours earlier. 
He saw it almost at once. 

IT WAS a little box not more 
than six inches in any dimension. Biron recognized it and his 
lower lip trembled slightly. He had 
never seen one before, but he had 
heard of them. He lifted the 
counter and took it into the bedroom. The little murmur fell off, 
almost ceased. It started again 
when the thin mica partition, 
through which the radiation entered, pointed toward the box. 
There was no question in his mind. 
It was a radiation bomb. 

The present radiations were not 
in themselves deadly; they were 



only a fuse. Somewhere inside the 
box a tiny atomic-pile was constructed. Short-lived artificial isotopes heated it slowly, permeating 
it with the appropriate particles. 
When the threshold of heat and 
particle density was reached, the 
pile reacted. Not in an explosion 
usually, although the heat of reaction would serve to fuse the box 
itself into a twist of metal, but in 
a tremendous burst of deadly radiation that would kill anything living within a radius of six feet to 
six miles, depending on the bomb's 
size. 

There was no way of telling 
when the threshold would be 
reached. Perhaps not for hours, perhaps the next moment. Biron remained standing helplessly, flashlight held loosely in his damp 
hands. Half an hour before, the 
visiphone had awakened him, and 
he had been at peace then. Now 
he knew he was going to die. 

Biron didn't want to die, but he 
was penned in hopelessly, and 
there was no place to hide. 

He knew the geography of the 
room. It was at the end of a corridor, so that there was another room 
only on one side, and» of Course, 
one above and below. He could do 
nothing about the room above. The 
room on the same floor was on the 
bathroom side and it adjoined via 
its own bathroom. He doubted 
that he could make himself heard. 

That left the room below. 

There were a couple of folding 



12 




 



chairs in the room, spare seats to 
accommodate company. He took 
one. It made a flat, slapping sound 
when it hit the floor. He turned it 
edgewise and the sound became 
harder and louder. 

Between each blow, he waited, 
wondering if he could rouse the 
sleeper below and annoy him sufficiently to have him report the disturbance. 

Abruptly, he caught a faint 
noise and paused, the splintering 
chair raised above his head. The 
noise came again, like a faint 
shout. It was from the direction of 
the door. 

He dropped the chair and yelled 
in return. He crushed his ear up 
against the crack where door joined 
wall, but the fit was good, and the 
sound even there was dim. 

But he could make out his own 
name being called, "Farrill ! Farrill!" several times over, and 
something else. Maybe, "Are you 
in there?" or, "Are you all right?" 

He roared back, "Get the door 
open." He shouted it three or four 
times. He was in a feverish sweat 
of impatience. The bomb might be 
on the point of letting loose even 
now. 

He thought they heard him. At 
least, the muffled cry came back, 
"Watch out. Something, something, 
blaster." He knew what that meant 
and backed hurriedly away from 
the door. 

There were a couple of sharp, 
cracking sounds, and he could ac


tually feel the vibrations set up in 
the air of the room. Then there 
followed a splitting noise and the 
door was flung inward. Light 
poured in from the corridor. 

Biron dashed out, arms flung 
wide. "Don't come in," he yelled. 
"For the love of Earth, don't come 
in. There's a radiation bomb in 
there." 

He was facing two men. One 
was Jonti. The other was Esbak, 
the superintendent. He was only 
partly dressed. 

"A radiation bomb?" he stuttered. 

But Jonti said, "What size?" 
Jonti's blaster was still in his hand, 
and only that jarred with the 
dandyish effect of his clothes, even 
at this time of night. 

BIRON could only gesture. 
"All right," said Jonti. He 
seemed quite cool about it, as he 
turned to the superintendent. 
"You'd better evacuate the rooms 
in this area, and if you have lead 
sheets anywhere on fhe University 
grounds, have them brought out 
here to line the corridor. And I 
wouldn't let anyone in there before 
morning." 

He turned to Biron. "It probably has a twelve to eighteen foot 
radius. How did it get there?" 

"I don't know," said Biron. He 
wiped his forehead with the back 
of his hand. "If you don't mind, 
I've got to sit down somewhere." 
He threw a glance at his wrist, 



TYRANN 



13 



then realized his wristwatch was 
still in the room. He had a wild 
impulse to ,return after it. 

There was plenty of action now. 
Students were being hustled out of 
their rooms. 

"Come with me," said Jonti. "I 
agree that you had better find a 
place to sit down and relax. You're 
white and shaking." 

Biron said, "What brought you 
out to my room? Not that I'm not 
thankful, you understand, just — 
curious. Wondering." 

"I called you. There was no answer, and I had to see you." 

"To see me?" He spoke carefully, trying to control his irregular breathing. "Why?" 

"To warn you that your life was 
in danger." 

Biron laughed raggedly. "I 
found out." 

"That was only the first attempt. 
They'll try again." 

"Who are the 'they?' " 

"Not here, Farrill," said Jonti. 
"We need privacy for this. You're 
a marked man, and I may already 
have endangered myself as well." 

CHAPTER II 

The Net Across Space 

THE student lounge was empty; 
dark as well. At four-thirty in 
the morning it could scarcely have 
been otherwise. Yet Jonti hesitated 
a moment as he held the door open, 
listening for occupants. 



"No," he said, softly, "leave the 
lights out. We don't need them to 
talk." 

"I've had enough of the dark 
for one night," objected Biron. 

"We'll leave the door ajar." 

Biron lacked the will to argue. 
He dropped into the nearest chair 
and watched the rectangle of light 
through the closing door narrow 
down to a thin line. Now that it 
was all over, he had the shakes. 

Jonti steadied the door and 
rested his little swagger-stick upon 
the crack of light on the floor. 
"Watch it. It will tell us if anyone 
passes, or if the door moves." 

Biron said, "Please, I'm not in a 
conspiratorial mood. If you don't 
mind, I'd appreciate your telling 
me whatever it is you want to tell 
me. You've saved my life, I know, 
and tomorrow I'll be properly grateful. Right now, I could do with 
a short drink and a long rest." 

"I can imagine your feelings," 
Jonti said, "but the too-long rest 
you might have had has been 
avoided, momentarily. I would like 
, to make it more than just momentarily. Do you know that I know 
your father?" 

The question was an abrupt one, 
and Biron raised his eyebrows, a 
gesture lost in the dark. He said, 
"He has never mentioned knowing 
you." 

"I would be surprised if he did. 
He doesn't know me by the name I 
use here. Have you heard from your 
father recently, by the way?" 



14 




 



"Why do you ask?" 
"Because he is also in great danger." 

"What?" 

Jonti's hand found the other's 
arm in the dimness and gripped 
it firmly. "Please! Keep your voice 
as it has been." Biron realized, for 
the first time, that they had been 
whispering. 

Jonti resumed, "I'll be more specific. Your father has been taken 
into custody. You understand the 
significance?" 

"No, I certainly don't understand. Who has taken him into custody, and what are you getting at? 
Why are you bothering me?" 
Biron's temples were throbbing. 
The Hypnite and the near-death 
had made it impossible to fence on 
even terms with the cool dandy 
sitting so close to him. 

"Surely," came the whisper, "you 
have some inkling of the work your 
father is doing." 

"If you know my father, you 
know he is Rancher of Widemos. 
That is his work." 

Jonti said, "Well, there is no 
reason you should trust me, other 
than that I am risking my own life 
for you. But I already know all you 
can tell me. As an example, I 
know that your father has been 
conspiring against the Tyranni." 

"I deny that," said Biron, tensely. 
"Your service to me tonight does 
not give you the right to make such 
statements about my father." 

"You are foolishly evasive, young 



man, and you are wasting my time. 
Don't you see that the situation is 
beyond verbal fencing? I'll say it 
outright. Your father is in the custody of the Tyranni. He may be 
dead by now." 

"I don't believe you." 

"I am in a position to know." 

"Let's break this off, Jonti. I am 
in no mood for mystery and I resent this attempt of yours to — " 

"To what?" Jonti's voice lost 
some of its refined edge. "What do 
I gain by telling you this? Let me 
remind you that this knowledge of 
mine, which you will not accept, 
indicated to me that an attempt 
might be made to kill you. Judge 
by what has happened, Farrill." 

BIRON said, "Start again and 
tell it straight. I'll listen." 
"Very well. I imagine, Farrill, 
that you know me to be a fellow 
countryman from the Nebular 
Kingdoms, although I've been passing myself off as a Vegan." 

"I judged that might be a possibility by your accent. It didn't 
seem important." . 

"It is important, my friend. I 
came here because, like your father, 
I didn't like the Tyranni. They've 
been oppressing our people for fifty 
years. That's a long time." 
"I'm not a politician." 
Again Jonti's voice had an irritated edge to it. "Oh, I'm not 
one of their agents trying to get 
you into trouble. I'm telling you the 
truth. They caught me a year ago 



TYRANN 



15 



as they have caught your father 
now. But I managed to get away 
and came to Earth, where I 
thought I might be safe until I was 
ready to return. That's all I need 
tell you about myself." 

"It is more than I have asked 
for." Biron could not force the unfriendliness out of his voice. Jonti 
affected him unfavorably with his 
too-precise mannerisms. 

"I know that. But it is necessary to tell you so much at least, for 
it was in this manner that I met 
your father. He worked with me, 
or, rather, I with him. He knew me 
not in his official capacity as the 
greatest nobleman on the planet of 
Nephelos. You understand me?" 




IRON nodded uselessly in the 
darkness and said, "Yes." 



"It is not necessary to go into 
that further. My sources of information have been maintained even 
here, and I know that he has been 
imprisoned. It is knowledge. Even 
if it had been merely suspicion, 
this attempt on your life would 
have been sufficient proof." 

"In what way?" 

"If the Tyranni have the father, 
would they leave the son at large?" 

"Are you trying to tell me that 
the Tyranni set that radiation bomb 
in my room? That's impossible." 

"Why is it impossible? Can't you 
understand their position? The 
Tyranni rule fifty worlds; they are 
outnumbered hundreds to one. In 
such a position, simple force is not 

16 



enough. Devious methods, intrigue, 
assassinations are their devices. 
The net they weave across space is 
a wide one and close-meshed. I can 
well believe that it extends across 
five hundred light years to Earth." 

Biron was still in the grip of his 
nightmare. In the distance, there 
were the faint sounds of the lead 
shields being moved into place. In 
his room, the counter was still murmuring. 

He said, "It doesn't make sense. 
I am going back to Nephelos this 
week. They would know that. Why 
should they kill me here? If they 
wait, they'd have me." He was relieved to find the flaw, eager to believe his own logic. 

Jonti leaned closer and his spiced 
breath stirred the hair on Biron's 
temple. "Your father is popular. 
His death — and once imprisoned by 
the Tyranni, his execution becomes 
a probability you must face — will 
be resented even by the cowed 
slave-race the Tyranni are trying 
to breed. You could rally that resentment as the new Rancher of 
Widemos and to execute you as 
well would double the danger for 
them. To make martyrs is not their 
purpose. But if you were to die in 
a faraway world, by accident, it 
would be convenient for them." 

"I don't believe you," said Biron. 
It had become his only defense. 

Jonti rose, adjusting his thin 
gloves. He said, "You go too far, 
Farrill. Your role would be more 
convincing if you pretended to no 


 



such complete ignorance. Your father may have been shielding you 
from reality for your own protection, presumably, yet I doubt that 
you could remain completely uninfluenced by his beliefs. Your hate 
for the Tyranni cannot help being 
a reflection of his own. You cannot help being ready to fight them." 

Biron shrugged without answering. 

Jonti said, "He may even recognize your new adulthood to the 
point of putting you to use. You 
are conveniently here on Earth and 
it is not unlikely that you may be 
combining your education with a 
definite assignment. An assignment, 
perhaps, for the failure of which 
the Tyranni are ready to kill you." 

"That's silly melodrama." 

"Is it? Let it be so, then. If the 
truth will not persuade you now, 
events will later. There will be other 
attempts on your life and the next 
one will succeed. From this moment 
on, Farrill, you are a dead man." 

BIRON looked up. "Wait! 
What's your own private interest in me?" 

"I am a patriot. I would like to 
see the Kingdoms free again, with 
governments of their own choosing." 

"No, your private interest," Biron 
insisted doggedly. "I cannot accept idealism only, because I won't 
believe it of you. I am sorry if that 
offends you." 

Jonti seated himself again. He 



said, "My lands have been confiscated. Before my exile, it was not 
comfortable to be forced to take 
orders from those dwarfs. And since 
then it has become more imperative 
than ever to become once again the 
man my grandfather had been before the Tyranni came. Is. that 
enough of a practical reason for 
wanting a revolution? Your father would have been a leader of 
that revolution. Failing him, you!" 

"I? I am twenty-three and know 
nothing of all this. You could find 
better men." 

"Undoubtedly I could, but no one 
else is the son of your father. If 
your father is killed, you will be 
Rancher of Widemos, and, as such, 
you would be valuable to me if you 
were only twelve and an idiot besides. I need you for the same reason the Tyranni must be rid of you. 
And if my necessity is unconvincing 
to you, surely theirs cannot be. 
There was a radiation bomb in your 
room. It could only have been 
meant to kill you. Who else would 
■ want to kill you?" 

Jonti waited patiently and picked 
up the other's whisper. 

"No one," admitted Biron reluctantly. "No one would want to 
kill me that I know of. Then it's 
true about my father." 

"It is true. View it as a casualty 
of war." 

"You think that would make it 
better? They'll put up a monument 
to him someday, perhaps ? One with 
a radiating inscription that you can 



TYRANN 



17 



see ten thousand miles out in 
space?" His voice was becoming 
harsh, savage. "Is that supposed to 
make me happy?" 

Jonti waited, but Biron said 
nothing more. 

Jonti said, "What do you intend 
doing?" 

"I'm going home." 

"You still don't understand your 
position, then." 

"I said I'm going home. What 
do you want me to do ? If he's alive, 
I'll get him out of there. And if 
he's dead, I'll — J'll — " 

"You'll do nothing!" The older 
man's voice was coldly annoyed. 
"You can't go to Nephelos. Don't 
you see that you can't? It would be 
just what the Tyranni would want 
you to do." 

Biron muttered, "What do you 
suggest ?" 

"Do you know the Director of 
Rhodia?" 

"The friend of the Tyranni? 
Everyone in the Kingdoms knows 
who he is. Hinrik V, Director of 
Rhodia." 

"Have you ever met him?" 

"No." 

"That is what I meant. If you 
haven't met him, you don't know 
him. He is an imbecile, Farrill. I 
mean it literally. But when the 
Ranchy of Widemos is confiscated 
by the Tyranni — and it will be, as 
my lands wer"e — it will be awarded 
to Hinrik. There the Tyranni will 
feel them to be safe, and there you 
must go." 



"Why?" 

"Because Hinrik, at least, has influence with the Tyranni; as much 
influence as a lick-spittle puppet 
may have. He may arrange to have 
you reinstated." 

"I don't see why. He's more 
likely to turn me over to them." 

"So he is. But you'll be on your 
guard against it, and there is a 
fighting chance that you may avoid 
it. Remember, the title you carry 
is valuable and important, but it is 
not all-sufficient. In this business 
of conspiracy, one must be practical 
above all. Men will rally about you 
out of sentiment and respect for 
your name, but to hold them, you 
will need money." 

BIRON hesitated. "I need time 
to decide." 
"You have no time. Your time 
ran out when the radiation bomb 
was planted in your room. The only 
thing left now is action. I can give 
you a letter of introduction to Hinrik of Rhodia." 

"You know him so well, then." 
"Your suspicion never sleeps, 
does it? I once headed a mission 
to Hinrik's court on behalf of the 
Autarch of Lingane. Hinrik's imbecile's mind will probably not remember me, but he will not dare 
to show he has forgotten. My letter 
will serve as introduction and you 
can improvise from there. I will 
have it for you in the morning. 
There is a ship leaving for Rhodia 
at noon. I have tickets for you. I 



18 




 



am leaving myself, but by another 
route. Don't linger. You're all 
through here, aren't you?" 

"There is the diploma presentation." 

"A scrap of parchment. Does it 
matter to you?" 
"Not now." 

"Do you have money?" 
"Enough." 

"Very well. Too much would be 
suspicious." He spoke sharply. 
"Farrill!" 

Biron stirred out of what was 
nearly a stupor. "What?" 

"Get back to the others. Tell no 
one you are leaving. Let the act 
speak." 

Biron nodded dumbly. Far down 
in the recesses of his mind, there 
was the thought that his mission 
had remained unaccomplished and 
that in this way, too, he had failed 
his doomed father. He was racked 
with a futile bitterness. His father 
might have told him more. He 
might have shared the dangers. He 
should not have been allowed to 
act in ignorance. 

And now that he knew the 
truth, or at least more of it, 
concerning the extent of his father's 
role in conspiracy, there was an 
added importance to the document 
he was to have obtained from 
Earth's archives. But there was no 
time any longer. No time to get 
the document. No' time to wonder 
about it. No time to save his father. 
No time, perhaps, to live. 

He said, "I'll do as you say." 



SANDER JONTI looked briefly 
out over the University campus 
is he paused on the steps of the 
dormitory. Certainly there was no 
admiration in his glance. 

Stepping down the bricked walk 
that wound unsubtly through the 
pseudo-rustic atmosphere affected by 
all urban campuses since antiquity, 
he could see the lights of the city's 
single important street gleam just 
ahead. Past it, drowned in daytime, 
but visible now, was the eternal 
radioactive blue of th» horizon, 
mute witness of the historic wars. 

Jonti considered the sky for a 
moment. Over fifty years had passed 
since the Tyranni had come and put 
a sudden end to the separate lives 
of two dozen sprawling, brawling 
political units in the depths beyond 
the Nebula. Now, suddenly and 
prematurely, the peace of strangulation lay upon them. 

The storm that had caught them 
in one vast thunder-clap had been 
something from which they had 
not yet recovered. It had left only 
a sort of twitching that futilely agitated a world here and there, now 
and then. To organize those twitchings, to align them into a single 
well-timed heave would be a difficult task, and a long one. Well, he 
had been rusticating here on Earth 
long enough. It was time to return. 

The others, back home, were 
probably trying to get in touch with 
him at his rooms right now. 
He lengthened his stride a bit. 
He caught the beam as he entered 



TYRANN 



19 



his room. It was a personal beam, 
for whose security there were as yet 
no fears and in whose privacy there 
was no chink. No formal receiver 
was required; no thing of metal 
and wires to catch the faint, drifting surges of electrons, with their 
whispered impulses swimming 
through hyper-space from a world 
half a thousand light years away. 

Space itself was polarized in his 
room, and prepared for reception. 
Its fabric was smoothed out of 
randomness. There was no way of 
detecting that polarization, except 
by receiving. And in that particular 
volume of space, only his own mind 
could act as receiver, since only the 
electrical characteristics of his own 
particular nerve-cell system could 
resonate to the vibrations of the 
carrier beam that bore the message. 

The message was as private as the 
unique characteristics of his own 
brain waves and in all the universe, 
with its quadrillions of human 
beings, the odds against a duplication sufficiently close to allow one 
man to pick up another's personal 
wave was a twenty-figured-number 
to one. 

Jonti's brain throbbed to the. call 
as it whined through the endless, 
empty incomprehensibility of hyperspace. 

"... calling . . . calling . . . calling . . . calling ..." 

SENDING was not quite as 
simple a job as receiving. A 
mechanical contrivance was needed 



to set up the highly specific carrier 
wave that would carry back to the 
contact beyond the Nebular. That 
was contained in the ornamental 
button that Jonti carried on his 
right shoulder.. It was automatically 
activated when he stepped into his 
volume of space-polarization, and 
after that he had only to think purposefully and with concentration. 

"Here I am!" No need for more 
specific identification. 

The dull repetition of the call 
halted and became words that took 
form within his mind, "We greet 
you, sir. Widemos has been executed. The news is, of course, not 
yet public." 

"It does not surprise me. Was 
anyone else implicated?" 

"No, sir. The Rancher made no 
statements at any time. A brave 
and loyal man." 

"Yes. But it takes more than 
simply bravery and loyalty, or he 
would not have been caught. A little more cowardice might have been 
useful. No matter. I have spoken to 
his son, the new Rancher, who has 
already had his brush with death. 
He will be put to use." 

"May one inquire in what manner, sir?" 

"It is better to let events answer 
your question. Certainly I cannot 
foretell consequences at this early 
date. Tomorrow he will set off to 
see Hinrik of Rhodia." 

"Hinrik! The young man will 
run a fearful risk. Is he aware 
that — " 



20 




 



"I have told him as much as I 
can," responded Jonti, sharply. "We 
cannot trust him too far until he 
has proved himself. Under the circumstances as they exist, we can 
only view him as a man to be 
risked, like any other man. He is 
expendable, quite expendable. Do 
not call me here again, as I am 
leaving Earth." 

And, with a gesture of finality, 
Jonti broke the connection mentally. 

Quietly and thoughtfully, he 
went over the events of the day and 
the night, weighing each event. 
Slowly, he smiled. Everything had 
been arranged perfectly, and the 
comedy might now play itself out. 

Nothing had been left to chance. 

CHAPTER III 

Chance and the Wristivatch 

THE first hour of a spaceship's 
rise from planetary thraldom 
is the most prosaic. There is the 
confusion of departure, which is 
much the same in essence as that 
which must have accompanied the 
shoving off of the first hollowedout tree trunk on some primeval 
river of Earth. 

You have your accommodations; 
your luggage is taken care of; there 
is the first stiff moment of strangeness and meaningless hustle surrounding you. The shouted lastmoment intimacies, the quieting, the 
muted clang of the airlocks, fol


lowed by the slow soughing of air 
as the locks screw inward automatically, like gigantic drills, becoming air-tight. 

Then the portentous silence and 
the red signs flicking in every 
room: "Adjust acceleration suits 
. . . Adjust acceleration suits." 

The stewards scour the corridors, knocking shortly on each door 
and jerking it open: "Beg pardon. 
Suits on." 

You battle with the suits, cold, 
tight, uncomfortable, but cradled in 
a hydraulic system which absorbs 
the sickening pressures of the takeoff. 

There is the faraway rumble of 
the atom-driven motors, on low 
power for atmospheric maneuvering, followed instantly by the giving back against slow-yielding oil 
of the suit-cradle. You recede almost indefinitely back; then very 
slowly forward again as the acceleration becomes negative. If you 
survive nausea during this period, 
you are probably safe from spacesickness for duration. 

The viewroom was not open to 
the passengers for the first three 
hours of the flight. There was a 
long line waiting when the atmosphere had been left behind and the 
double-doors were ready to separate. 
There were present not only the 
usual hundred per cent turnout of 
all Planetaries — those, in other 
words, who had never been in space 
before — but a fair proportion of the 
more experienced travelers as well. 



TYRANN 



21 



The vision of Earth from space, 
after all, was one of the tourist 
"musts." 

The viewroom was a bubble on 
the ship's "skin," a bubble of a 
curved two-foot-thick, steel-hard 
transparent plastic. The retractile 
iridium-steel lid which protected it 
against the scouring of the atmosphere and its dust particles had 
been rolled back. The lights were 
out and the gallery was full. The 
faces peering over the bars were 
clear in the Earthshine. 

For Earth was suspended there 
below, a gigantic and gleaming 
orange- and - blue- and- white-patched 
balloon. The hemisphere showing 
was almost entirely sunlit; the continents between the clouds, a desert 
orange, with thin scattered lines of 
green. The seas were blue, standing 
out sharply against the black of 
space where they met the horizon. 
And all around in the black, undusted sky were the stars. 

THEY waited patiently, those 
who watched. 
It was not the sunlit hemisphere 
they wanted. The polar cap, blinding bright, was shifting into view as 
the ship maintained the slight, unnoticed sidewise acceleration that 
was lifting it out of the ecliptic. 
Slowly the shadow of night encroached upon the globe and the 
huge "World Island" of EurasiaAfrica majestically took the stage, 
north-side "down." 

Its diseased unliving soil hid its 



horror under a night-induced play 
of jewels. The radioactivity of the 
soil was a vast sea of iridescent blue, 
sparking in strange festoons that 
spelled out the manner in which 
the nuclear bombs had once landed, 
a full generation before the forcefield defense against nuclear explosions had been developed, so 
that no other world could commit 
suicide in just that fashion again. 

The eyes watched until, with the 
hours, Earth was a bright little 
half-coin in the endless black. 

Among the watchers was .Biron 
Farrill. He sat by himself in the 
front row, arms upon the railing, 
eyes brooding and thoughtful. This 
was not the way he had expected to 
leave Earth. It was the wrong manner, the wrong ship, the wrong 
destination. 

His tanned forearm rubbed 
against the stubble of his chin and 
he felt guilty about not having 
shaved that morning. He'd go back 
to his room after a while and correct that. Meanwhile he hesitated to 
leave. There were people here. In 
his room, he would be alone. 

Or was that just the reason he 
should leave? 

He did not like the new feeling 
he had, that of being hunted, of 
being friendless. 

All friendship had dropped from 
him. It had shriveled from the 
moment he had been awakened by 
the phone call less than twenty-four 
hours earlier. 

Even in the dormitory, he had 



22 




 



become an embarrassment. Old Esbak had pounced upon him when 
he had returned after his talk with 
Jonti in the student lounge. Esbak 
was in turmoil, his voice overshrill. 

"Mr. Farrill, I've been looking 
for you. It has been a most unfortunate incident. I can't understand 
it. Do you have any explanation?" 

"No," Biron had half-shouted, "I 
don't. When can I get into my room 
and get my stuff out?" 

"In the morning, I am sure. 
We've just managed to get the 
equipment up here to test the room. 
There is no longer any trace of 
radioactivity above normal background level. It was a very fortunate escape for you. It must have 
missed you by only minutes." 

"Yes, yes, but if you don't mind, 
I would like to rest." 

"Please use my room till morning and then we'll get you relocated for the few days remaining 
you. Umm, by the way, Mr. Farrill, if you don't mind, there is another matter." 

He was being overly polite. Biron 
could almost hear the eggshells give 
slightly beneath his finicky feet. 

"What other matter?" asked 
Biron, wearily. 

"Do you know of anyone who 
might have been interested in — er 
— hazing you?" 

, "Hazing me like this} Of course 
not." 

"What are your plans, then? The 
school authorities would, of course, 



be most unhappy to have publicity 
arise as a result of this incident." 

HOW lie kept referring to it as 
an "incident." Biron said, 
dryly, "I understand you. But don'c 
worry. I'm not interested in investigations or in the police. I'm 
leaving Earth shortly and I'd jus!: 
as soon not have my own plans disrupted. I'm not bringing any 
charges. After all, I'm still alive." 

Esbak had been almost indecently relieved. It was all they 
wanted from him. No unpleasantness. It was-just an incident to be 
forgotten. 

He got into his old room again 
at seven in the morning. It was 
quiet and there was no murmuring 
in the closet. The bomb was no 
longer there, nor was the radiation 
counter. They had probably been 
taken away by Esbak and thrown 
into a contaminated area. It came 
under the head of destroying evidence, but that was the school's 
worry. Biron tossed his belongings 
into suitcases and then called the 
desk for assignment to another 
room. The lights were working 
again, he noticed, and so, of course, 
was the visiphone. The one remnant 
of last night was the twisted door, 
its lock melted away. 

They gave him another room. 
That established his intention to 
stay for anyone who might be listening. Then, using the hall phone, 
he had called an aircab. He did not 
think anyone saw him. Let the 



TYRANN 



23 



school puzzle out his disappearance 
however they pleased. 

For a moment, he had caught 
sight of Jonti at the spaceport. 
They met in the fashion of a glancing blow. Jonti said nothing; gave 
no sign of recognition, but after 
he had passed by, there were in 
Biron's hand a featureless tiny 
black globe that was a personal 
message capsule and a ticket for 
passage to Rhodia. 

He spent a moment upon the personal capsule. It was not sealed. He 



read the message later in his room. 
It was a simple introduction with 
minimum wordage. 

Biron's thoughts rested for a 
while upon Sander Jonti as he 
watched Earth shrivel with distance through the viewroom bubble. He had known the man very 
superficially until Jonti had whirled 
so devastatingly into his life, first 
to save it and then to set it upon a 
new and untried course. Biron had 
known his name; he had nodded 
whenever they had passed; had 




exchanged polite formalities occasionally, but that was all. He had 
not liked the man, had not liked 
his coldness, his overdressed, overmannered personality. But all that 
had nothing to do with affairs 
now. 

Biron rubbed his crew-cut with a 
restless hand and sighed. He actually found himself hungering for 
Jonti's presence. The man was at 
least master of events. He had 
known what to do; he had known 
what Biron was to do; he had made 
Biron do it. And now Biron was 
alone and feeling very young, very 
helpless, very friendless, and almost frightened. 

THROUGH it all, he studiously 
avoided thinking of his father. 
It would not help. 
"Mr. Malaine." 

The name was repeated two or 
three times, before Biron started at 
the respectful touch upon his shoulder, and looked up. 

The robot messenger said again, 
"Mr. Malaine," and for five seconds, Biron stared blankly, until 
he remembered that that was his 
temporary name. It had been penciled lightly upon the ticket which 
Jonti had given him. A stateroom 
had been reserved in that name. 

"Yes, what is it? I am Malaine." 

The messenger's voice hissed very 
faintly as the spool within whirled 
off its message. "I have been asked 
to inform you that your stateroom 
has been changed, and that your 



baggage has already been shifted. 
If you will see the purser, you will 
be given your new key and asked 
to surrender your old. We trust that 
this will cause no inconvenience for 
you." 

"What's all this?" Biron whirled 
in his seat, and several of the thinning group of passengers, still 
watching, looked up at the explosive sound. "What's the idea?" 

Of course, it was no use arguing 
with a machine that had merely 
fulfilled its function. The messenger 
bowed its metal head respectfully, 
its gently fixed imitation of a human smile of ingratiation unchanging, and left. 

Biron strode but of the viewroom 
and accosted the ship's officer at the 
door with somewhat more energy 
than he had -planned. 

"Look here, I want to see the 
captain." 

The officer showed no surprise. 
"Is it important, sir?" 

"It sure as Space is. I've just 
had my stateroom shifted without 
my permission and I'd like to know 
the meaning of it." 

Even at the time, Biron felt his 
anger to be out of proportion to the 
cause, but it represented an accumulation of resentment. He had 
nearly been killed; he had been 
forced to leave Earth like a skulking criminal; he was going heknew-not-where to do he-knewnot-what; and now they were pushing him around aboard ship. It 
was too much.

Yet through it all, he had the 
uncomfortable feeling that Jonti, in 
his shoes, would have acted differently, perhaps more wisely. Well, 
he wasn't Jonti. 

The officer said, "I will call the 
purser." 

"I want the captain," insisted 
Biron. 

"If you wish, then." And after a 
short conversation through the small 
ship's communicator suspended 
from his lapel, he said urbanely, 
"You will be called for. Please 
wait." 

CAPTAIN HIRM GORDELL 
was a rather short and thickset man, who rose politely and 
leaned over his desk to shake hands 
with Biron when the latter entered. 

"Mr. Malaine," he said, "I am 
sorry we had to trouble you." 

He had a rectangular face, irongray hair, a short, well-kept mustache of slightly darker hue, and„a 
clipped smile. 

"So am I," said Biron. "I had a 
stateroom reservation to which I 
was entitled and I feel that not 
even you, sir, had the right to 
change it without my permission." 

"Granted, Mr. Malaine. But you 
understand, it was rather an emergency. A last minute arrival, an 
important man, insisted on being 
moved to a stateroom closer to the 
gravitational center of the ship. He 
had a heart condition and it was 
important to keep ship's gravity as 



low as possible for him. We had 
no choice,," 

"All right, but why pick on me 
as the one to be shifted?" 

"It had to be someone. You are 
traveling alone; you are a young 
man who, we felt, would have no 
difficulty in taking a slightly higher 
gravity." His eyes moved automatically up and down Biron's six-feettwo of hard musculature. "Besides, 
you will find your new room rather 
more elaborate than your old one. 
You have not lost by the exchange. 
No, indeed." 

The captain stepped from behind 
his desk. "May I show you your 
new quarters personally?" 

Biron found difficulty in maintaining his resentment. It seemed 
reasonable, this whole matter, and, 
then again, not reasonable, either. 

The captain was saying as they 
left his quarters, "May I have your 
company at my table for tomorrow 
night's dinner? Our first Jump is 
scheduled for that time." 

Biron heard himself saying, 
"Thank you. I will be honored." 

Yet he thought the invitation 
strange. Granted that the captain 
was merely trying to soothe him, yet 
surely the method was stronger than 
necessary. 

THE captain's table was a long 
one, taking up an entire wall of 
the salon. Biron found himself near 
the center, taking an unsuitable 
precedence over others. Yet there" 
was his placecard before him. The 



26 




 



steward had been quite firm; there 
was no mistake. 

Biron was not particularly overmodest. As son of the Rancher of 
Widemos, born to the nobility, he 
would have felt entitled to this kind 
of respectful treatment. But as 
Biron Malaine, he was just an 
ordinary citizen, and these things 
never happened to ordinary citizens. 

For one thing, the captain had 
been perfectly correct about his new 
stateroom. It was more elaborate. 
His original room had been what 
his ticket called for, a single, second class, while the replacement 
was a double room, first class. 
There was a bathroom adjoining, 
private, of course, equipped with 
a stall-shower and an air-dryer. 

It was near "officer's country" 
and the presence of uniforms was 
almost overpowering. Lunch had 
been brought to his room on silver 
service. A barber made a sudden 
appearance just before dinner. All 
this was perhaps to be expected 
when one traveled as a nobleman on 
a luxury spaceliner, first class, but 
it was too good for Biron Malaine, 
unknown commoner. 

It was far too good, for by the 
time the barber had arrived, Biron 
had just returned from an afternoon walk that had taken him 
through the corridors in a purposely 
devious path. There had been crewmen in his path wherever he had 
turned; polite, much too attentive. 
He shook them free somehow and 



reached HOD, his first room, the 
one he had never slept in. 

HE STOPPED to light a cigaret 
and in the interval spent thus, 
the only passenger in sight turned 
a corridor. Biron touched the signal 
light briefly and there was no answer. 

Well, the old key had not been 
taken from him yet. An oversight, 
no doubt. He placed the thin oblong sliver of metal into its slot and 
the unique pattern of leaden opacity 
within the aluminum sheath activated the tiny photo-tube. The 
door opened and he took one step 
inside. 

It was all he needed. He left and 
the door closed automatically behind him. His old room was not 
occupied; neither by an important 
personage with a weak heart nor by 
anyone else. The bed and furnishings were stripped down; no .trunks, 
nc toilet articles were in sight; the 
very air of occupancy was missing. 

So the luxury they were surrounding him with served only to 
prevent his taking further action to 
get back his original room. They 
were bribing him to stay quietly 
out of the old room. Why? Was it 
the room they were interested in, 
or was it himself? 

And now he sat at the captain's 
table with the questions unanswered 
and rose politely with the rest as 
the captain entered, strode up the 
steps of the dais on which the long 
table was set, and took his place. 



TYRANN 



27 



Why had they moved him? 

There was music in the ship and 
the walls that separated the salon 
from the viewroom had been retracted. The lights were low and 
tinged with orange-red. Even the 
queaziest passengers' space-sickness 
had passed after the original ac-. 
celeration, or as the result of first 
exposure to the minor gravity 
variations between various parts of 
the ship. The salon was full. 

THE captain leaned forward 
and said to Biron, "Good 
evening, Mr. Malaine. How do you 
find your new room?" 

"Almost too satisfactory, sir. A 
little rich for my way of life." He 
said it in a flat monotone, and it 
seemed to him that a faint dismay 
passed momentarily across the captain's face. 

Over the dessert, the skin of the 
viewroom's glass bubble slid 
smoothly back into its socket, and 
the lights dimmed to nearly 
nothing. Neither Sun, Earth, nor 
any planet was in view on that 
large, dark screen. They were facing the Milky Way, that lengthwise 
view of the Galactic Lens, and it 
made a luminous diagonal track 
among the hard, bright stars. 

Automatically, the tide of conversation ebbed. Chairs shifted so 
that all faced the stars. The dinner 
guests had become an audience, the 
music a faint whisper. 

'The voice over the amplifiers was 
clear in the gathered quiet. 



"Ladies and gentlemen, we are 
ready for our first Jump. Most of 
you, I suppose, know at least theoretically what a Jump is. Many of 
you, however, have never experienced one. It is to those last I 
would like to speak in particular. 

"The Jump is exactly what the 
name implies. In the fabric of 
space-time itself, it is impossible to 
travel faster than the speed of light. 
That is a natural law, first discovered by one of the ancients; the 
traditional Einstein, perhaps, except that so many things are 
credited to him. Even at the speed 
of light, of course, it would take 
years, in subjective time, to reach 
the stars. 
"Therefore one leaves the spacetime fabric to enter the little-known 
realm of hyper-space, where time 
and distance have no meaning. It 
is like traveling across a narrow 
isthmus to pass from one ocean to 
another, rather than remaining at 
sea and circling a continent to reach 
the same objective. 

"Great amounts of energy are required, of course, to enter this 
'space within space,' as some call 
it, and a great deal of ingenious 
calculation must be made to insure 
re-entry into ordinary space-time at 
the proper point. The result of the 
expenditure of this energy and intelligence is that immense distances 
can be traversed in zero time. It is 
only the Jump which makes interstellar travel possible. 

"The Jump we are about to make 



28 




 



will take place in about ten minutes. 
You will be warned. There is never 
more than some momentary minor 
discomfort; therefore, I hope all 
of you will remain calm. Thank 
you." 

THE ship lights went out altogether, and there were only the 
stars left. 

It seemed a long while before a 
crisp announcement filled the air 
momentarily. "The Jump will take 
place in exactly one minute." And 
then the same voice counted the 
seconds backward: "Fifty . . . forty 
. . . thirty . . . twenty . . . ten . . . 
five . . . three . . . two . . . one . . ." 

It was as though there had been 
a momentary discontinuity in existence, a bump which joggled only 
the deep inside of a man's bones. 

In that immeasurable fraction of 
a second, one hundred light years 
had passed, and the ship, which 
had been on the outskirts of the 
Solar system, was now in the depths 
of interstellar space. 

Someone near Biron said, shakily, 
"Look at the stars!" 

In a moment, the whisper had 
taken life through the large room 
and hissed itself across the tables: 
"The stars! See!" 

In that same immeasurable fraction of a second, the star-view had 
changed radically. The center of the 
great Galaxy, which stretched thirty 
thousand light years from tip to tip, 
was closer now, and the stars had 
thickened in number. They spread 



across the black velvet vacuum in a 
fine powder, backdropping the occasional brightness of the nearby 
stars. 

Biron, against his "will, remembered the beginning of a poem he 
himself had once written at the 
sentimental age of nineteen, on the 
occasion of his first space flight; the 
one that had first taken him to the 
Earth he was now leaving: 

The stars, like dust, encircle me 
In living mists of light; 
And all of space I seem to see 
In one vast burst of sight. 

The lights went on then, and 
Biron's thoughts were snapped out 
of space as suddenly as they had 
entered it. He was in a spaceliner's 
salon again, with a dinner dragging to an end, and the hum of 
conversation rising to a prosaic 
level. 

He glanced at his wristwatch, 
half looked away; then, very slowly brought the wristwatch into 
focus again. He stared at it for a 
long minute. It was the wristwatch 
he had left in his bedroom that 
night. It had withstood the killim; 
radiation of the bomb, and he had 
collected it with the rest of his 
belongings the next morning. Howmany times had he looked at it since 
then? How many times had he 
stared at it, taken mental note of 
the time, and no note at all of the 
other piece of information it 
shouted at him? 



TYRANN 



29 



For the plastic wrist band was 
white, not blue. It was white! 

Slowly the events of that night, 
all of them, fell into place. Strange 
how one fact could shake all the 
confusion out of them. 

He rose abruptly, murmuring, 
"Pardon me!" under his breath. It 
was a breach of etiquette to leave 
before the captain, but that was 
a matter of small importance to him 
then. 

He hastened to his room, striding 
up the ramps rapidly, rather than 
waiting for the non-gravity elevators. He locked the door behind 
him and looked quickly through 
the bathroom and the built-in 
closets. He had no real hope of 
catching anyone. What they had had 
to do, they must have done hours 
ago. 

Carefully, he went through his 
baggage. They had done a thorough 
job. With scarcely any sign to show 
that they had come and gone, they 
had carefully withdrawn his identification papers, a packet of letters from his father, and even his 
capsular introduction to Hinrik of 
Rhodia. 

THAT was why they had moved 
him. It was neither the old room 
nor the new that they were interested in ; merely the process of moving. For nearly an hour they must 
have legitimately — legitimately, by 
Space — concerned themselves with 
his baggage, and served their own 
purposes thereby. 



Biron sank down upon the 
double bed and thought furiously, 
but it didn't help. The trap had 
been perfect. Everything had been 
planned. Had it not been for the 
completely unpredictable chance of 
his leaving his wristwatch in the 
bedroom that night, he would not 
even now have realized how closemeshed the Tyranni's net through 
space was. 

There was a soft burr as his door 
signal sounded. 

"Come in," he said. 

It was the steward, who said respectfully, "The captain wishes to 
know if there is anything he can 
do for you. You seemed ill as you 
left the table." 

"I'm all right," Biron said, feeling very far from all right. 

How they watched him! And in 
that moment, he knew that there 
was no escape, and that the ship 
was carrying him politely, but surely, to his death. 

CHAPTER IV 

Free? 

SANDER JONTI met the other's 
eyes coldly. He repeated, 
"Gone, you say?" 

Rizzett passed a hand over his 
ruddy face. "Something is gone. I 
don't know its identity. It might 
have been the document we're after, 
certainly. All we know about it is 
that it had been dated somewhere 
in the fifteenth to twenty-first cen


30 




 



tury of Earth's primitive calendar, 
and that it is dangerous." 

"Is there any definite reason to 
believe that the missing- one is the 
document?" 

"Only circumstantial reasoning. 
It was guarded closely by the Earth 
government." 

"Discount that," Jonti said impatiently. "An Earthman will treat 
any documents relating to the preGalactic past with veneration. It's 
their ridiculous worship of tradition." 

"But this one was stolen and yet 
they never announced the fact. Why 
should they guard an empty case?" 

"I can imagine their doing that 
rather than find themselves forced 
to admit that a holy relic has been 
stolen. Yet I cannot believe that 
young Farrill obtained it after all. 
I thought you had him under observation." 




IZZETT smiled confidently. 
' "He didn't get it." 



"How do you know?" 

"Because," said Rizzett, "the 
document has been gone twenty 
years." 

"What?" 

"It was lost or stolen twenty 
years ago," Rizzett explained. 

"Then it can't be the right one. 
It was less than six months ago 
that the Rancher learned of its 
existence." 

"Then somebody else beat him 
to it by nineteen and a half years." 

Jonti thought silently. He said, 



"It does not matter. It cannot matter." 

"Why so?" 

"Because I have been here on 
Earth for months. Before I came, it 
was easy to believe that there might 
be information of value on r the 
planet. But consider now. When 
Earth was the only inhabited planet 
in the Galaxy, it was a primitive 
place, militarily speaking. The only 
weapon they had ever invented 
worth mentioning was a crude and 
inefficient nuclear-reaction bomb for 
which they had not even developed 
the logical defense." Jonti's nattily 
sleeved arm made a delicate gesture 
to where the blue horizon gleamed 
its sickly radioactivity. 

He went on, "All this is placed 
in sharp focus for me as a temporary resident here. It is ridiculous 
to assume that it is possible to 
learn anything from a society at that 
level of military technology. It is 
always very fashionable to assume 
that there are lost arts and lost 
sciences, and there are always these 
people who make a cult of primitivism, making all sorts of ridiculous claims for the prehistoric civilizations on Earth." 

"Yet the Rancher was a wise 
man," Rizzett objected. "He told 
us specifically that it was the most 
dangerous document he knew. You 
remember what he said. I can quote 
it. He said, 'The matter is death for 
the Tyranni, and death for those 
who use it as well; but it would 
mean final life for the Galaxy.' " 



TYRANN 



31 



"The Rancher, like all human 
beings, can be wrong." 

"Consider, sir, that we have no 
idea as to the nature of the document. It could, for instance, be 
somebody's laboratory notes which 
had never been published. It might 
be something that could relate to a 
weapon that Earthmen had never 
recognized as a weapon; something 
which on the face of it might not 
appear to be a weapon — " 

"Nonsense. You are a military 
man and should know better. If 
there is one science into which Man 
has probed continuously and successfully, it is that of military technology. No potential weapon would 
remain unrealized for ten thousand 
years. I think, Rizzett, we will return to Lingane." 

Rizzett shrugged. He was not 
convinced. 

Nor, a thousandfold, was Jonti. 
It had been stolen and that was 
significant. It had obviously been 
worth stealing. Anyone in the 
Galaxy might have it now. 

Unwillingly the thought came to 
him that the Tyranni might have 
it. The Rancher had been most evasive on the matter. Even Jonti, himself, had not been trusted sufficiently. The Randier had said it 
carried death; it could not be used 
without having it cut , both ways. 
Jonti's lips clamped shut. The fool 
and his idiotic hintings! And now 
the Tyranni had him. 

What if a man like Aratap were 
now in the possession of such a 



secret as this might be? Aratap! 
The one man, now that the Rancher 
was gone, who remained unpredictable; th? most dangerous Tyrannian of them all. 

SIMOK ARATAP was a small 
man; a little bandy-legged, narrow-eyed fellow. He had the 
stumpy, thick-limbed appearance 
of the average Tyrannian, yet, 
though he faced an exceptionally 
large and well-muscled specimen of 
the subject worlds, he was completely self-possessed. He was the 
confident heir (in the second generation) of those who had left their 
windy, infertile worlds and sparked 
across the emptiness to capture and 
enchain the rich and populous 
planets of the Nebular Regions. 

His father had headed a squadton of small, flitting ships that had 
struck and vanished, then struck 
again; and had made scrap of the 
lumbering titanic ships that had opposed them. 

The worlds of the Nebula had 
fought in the old fashion, but the 
Tyranni had learned a new one. 
Where the huge, glittering vessels 
of the opposed navies attempted 
single combat, they found themselves flailing at emptiness and 
wasting their stores of energy. Instead, the Tyranni, abandoning 
power alone, stressed speed and 
cooperation, so that the opposed 
kingdoms toppled one after the 
other, singly, each waiting half -joyfully at the discomfiture of its 



32 




 



neighbors, fallaciously secure behind its steel-shipped ramparts, until its own turn came. 

But those wars were fifty years 
in the past. Now the Nebular regions were satrapies that required 
merely the acts of occupation and 
taxation. Previously there had been 
worlds to gain, Aratap thought 
wearily, and now there was little 
left to do but to contend with individual men. 

He looked at the young man who 
faced him. A very young man. A 
tall fellow with good shoulders indeed; an absorbed, intent face with 
the hair of his head cut ridiculously 
short in what was undoubtedly a 
collegiate affectation. In an unofficial sense, Aratap was sorry for 
him. He was obviously frightened. 

BJRON did not recognize the 
feeling inside him as "fright." 
If he had been asked to put a name 
to the emotion, he would have described it as "tension." All his life, 
he had known the Tyranni to be 
the overlords. His father, strong 
and vital though he was, unquestioned on his own estate, respectfully heard on others, was quiet and 
almost humble in the presence of 
the Tyranni. 

They came occasionally to Widemos on polite visits, with questions 
as to the annual tribute they called 
taxation. The Rancher of Widemos 
was responsible for the collection 
and delivery of these funds on behalf of the planet Nephelos and, 



perfunctorily, the Tyranni would 
check his books. 

The Rancher himself would assist them out of their small vessels. They would sit at the head 
of the table at mealtimes where 
they would be served first. When 
they spoke, all other conversation 
slopped instantly. 

As a child, he wondered that 
such small, ugly men should be 
so carefully handled, but he learned 
as he grew up that they were, to his 
father, what his father was to a 
cowhand. He even learned to speak 
softly to them himself, and to address them as "Excellency." 

He had learned so well that now 
that he faced one of the overlords, 
one of the Tyranni, he could feel 
himself stiffen with tension. 

The ship which he had considered his prison became officially one 
on the day of landing upon 
Rhodia. They had signaled at his 
door and two husky crewmen had 
entered and stood on either side of 
him. The captain, who followed, 
had said in a flat voice, "Biron 
Farrill, I take you into custody by 
the power vested in me as captain 
of this vessel, and hold you for 
questioning by the Commissioner of 
the Great King." 

The Commissioner was this small 
Tyrannian who sat before him now, 
seemingly abstracted and uninterested. The "Great King" was the 
Khan of the Tyranni, who still 
lived in the legendary stone palace 
on the Tyrannian's home planet. 



TYRANN 



33 




Biron looked furtively about him. 
He was not physically constrained 
in any way, but four guards in the 
slate-blue of the Tyrannian "Outer 
Police" flanked him, two and two. 
They were armed. A fifth, with a 
major's insignia, sat beside the 
Commissioner's desk. 



The Commissioner spoke for the 
first time, his voice high-pitched, 
thin. "The old Rancher of Widemos, your father, has been executed 
for treason." 

His faded eyes were fixed on 
Biron's. There seemed nothing beyond mildness in them. 

Biron remained stolid. It bothered him that he could do nothing. 
It would have been so much more 
satisfying to howl at them, to flail 
madly at them, but that would not 
make his father less dead. He 
thought he knew the reason for this 
initial statement. It was intended to 
break him down, to make him give 
himself away. Well, it wouldn't. 

He said, evenly, "I am Biron 
Malaine of Earth. If you are questioning my identity, I would like to 
communicate with the Terrestrial 
Consul." 

"Ah, yes, but we are at a purely 
informal stage just now. You are 
Biron Malaine, you say, of Earth. 
And yet," Aratap indicated the 
papers before him, "there are letters here which were written by 
Widemos to his son. There are college registration receipts and tickets 
to commencement exercises made 
out to Biron Farrill. They were 
found in your baggage." 

Biron felt desperate, but he did 
not let it show. "My baggage was 
searched illegally, so that I deny 
that this is evidence." 

"We are not in a court of law, 
Mr. Farrill or Malaine. How do you 
explain them?" 



34 




 



"If they were found in my baggage, they were placed there by 
someone else." 

The Commissioner passed it by. 
Biron felt amazed. His statements 
sounded so thin, so patently foolish, 
yet the Commissioner did not remark upon them, but only tapped 
the black capsule. "And this introduction to the Director of Rhodia? 
Also not yours?" 



"No, that is mine." Biron had 
planned that. The introduction did 
not mention his name. He said, 
"There is a plot to assassinate the 
Director — " 

He stopped, appalled. It sounded 
so completely unconvincing when 
he finally put the beginning of his 
carefully prepared speech into actual sound. Surely, the Commissioner was smiling cynically at him. 



TYRANN 



35 



But Aratap was not. He merely 
sighed a little and with quick, 
practiced gestures removed contact 
lenses from his eyes and placed 
them carefully in a glass of saline 
solution that stood on the desk before him. His naked eyeballs were 
a little watery. 

He said, "And you know of it? 
Even back on Earth, five hundred 
light-years away? Our own police 
here on Rhodia have not heard of 

it." : " " 

"The police are here. The plot is 
being developed on Earth." 

"I see. And are you their agent? 
Or are you going to warn Hinrik 
against them?" 

"The latter, of course." 

"Indeed? And why do you intend 
to warn him?" 

"For the substantial reward 
which I expect to get." 

Aratap smiled. "That at least 
rings true, and lends a certain 
truthful gloss to your previous 
statements. What are the details of 
the plot you speak of?" 

"That is for the Director only." 

A momentary hesitation, then a 
shrug. "Very well. The Tyranni 
are not interested and do not concern themselves with local politics. 
We will arrange an interview between yourself and the Director and 
that will be our contribution to his 
safety. My men will hold you until 
your baggage can be collected, and 
then you will be free to go. Remove him." 

The last was to the armed men, 



who left with Biron. Aratap replaced his contact lenses,, an action 
which changed instantly that look 
of vague incompetence their absence had seemed to induce. 

He said to the major, who had 
remained, "We will keep an eye, I 
think, on this young Farrill." 

The officer nodded shortly. "For 
a moment I thought you might have 
been taken in. To me, his story was 
pure nonsense." 

"It was. It's just that which 
makes him maneuverable for the 
while. All young fools who get 
their notions of interstellar intrigue 
from the video spy-thrillers are 
easily handled. He is, of course, the 
son of the ex-Rancher." 

NOW the major hesitated, "Are 
you sure? It's a vague and 
unsatisfactory accusation we have 
against him." 

"You mean that it might be arranged evidence after all? For what 
purpose ?" 

"It could mean that he is a decoy, 
sacrificed to divert our attention 
from a real Biron Farrill elsewhere." 

"No. Improbably theatrical. Besides, we have a photocube." 

"What? Of the boy?" 

"Of the Rancher's son. Would 
you like to see it?" 

Aratap lifted the paperweight 
upon his desk. It was a simple 
glass cube, three inches on each 
side, black and opaque. He said, 
"I meant to confront him with it, 



36 




 



if it had seemed best. It is a shrewd 
process, this one, Major. I don't 
know if you're acquainted with it. 
It's been developed recently 
among the inner worlds.. Outwardly, it seems an ordinary photocube, but when it is turned upside 
down, there's an automatic molecular rearrangement which renders 
it totally opaque. It is a pleasant 
conceit." 

HE TURNED the cube rightside up. The opacity shimmered for a moment, then cleared 
slowly like a black fog wisping and 
feathering before the wind. Aratap 
watched it calmly. 

And then it was water clear, and 
a young face smiled brightly out 
of it, accurate and alive, trapped 
and solidified in mid-breath forever. 

"An item," said Aratap, "in the 
ex-Rancher's possessions. What do 
you think?" 

"It is the young man, without 
question." 

"Yes." The Tyrannian official 
regarded the photocube thoughtfully. "You know, using this same 
process, I don't see why six photographs could not be taken in the 
same cube. It has six faces, and by 
resting the cube on each of them 
in turn, a series of new molecular 
orientations might be induced. Six 
connected photographs, flowing 
one into another as you turned; a 
static phenomenon turned dynamic 
and taking on new breadth and 



vision. Major, it would be a new 
art form." A mounting enthusiasm 
had crept into his voice. 

But the silent major looked 
faintly scornful, and Aratap left his 
artistic reflections to say, abruptly, 
"You will watch Farrill?" 

"Certainly." 

"Watch Hinrik as well." 
"Hinrik?" 

"Of course. It is the whole purpose of freeing the boy. I want 
some questions answered. Why is 
Farrill seeing Hinrik? What is the 
connection between them? The 
dead Rancher did not play a lone 
hand. There was — there must 
have been — a well-organized conspiracy behind him." 

"But surely Hinrik could not be 
involved. He lacks the intelligence, 
even if he had the courage." 

"Granted. But it is just because 
he is half an idiot that he may 
serve them as a tool. If so, he represents a weakness in our scheme of 
things. We obviously cannot afford 
to neglect the possibility." 

He gestured absently; the major 
saluted, swung on his heel and left. 

Aratap sighed, turned the photocube thoughtfully in his hand and 
watched the blackness wash back 
like a tide of ink. 

Life had been simpler in his 
father's time. To smash a planet 
had a cruel grandeur about it, 
while this careful maneuvering of 
an ignorant young man was simply 
cruel. 

And yet necessary.

CHAPTER V 

Uneasy Lies the Head 

THE Directorship of Rhodia is 
not ancient, when compared 
with Earth, as a habitat for Homo 
scpiens. It is not ancient even when 
compared with the Centaurian or 
Sirian worlds. The planets of Arcrurus, for instance, had been settled 
for two hundred years when the 
first spaceships circled the Horsehead Nebula to find the nqst of 
hundreds of oxygen-water planets 
behind. They clustered thickly and 
ic was a real find, for although 
planets infest space, few can maintain human life. 

There are between one and two 
hundred billion radiant stars in the 
Galaxy. Among them are some five 
hundred billion planets. Of these, 
some have gravities over 120% 
that of Earth, or less than 60%, 
and are therefore unbearable in the 
long run. Some are too hot; some 
too cold. Some have poisonous atmospheres, and planetary atmospheres consisting largely or entirely of neon, methane, ammonia, 
chlorine, even silicon tetrafluoride 
have been recorded. Some planets 
lack water, one with oceans of almost pure sulfur dioxide having 
been described. Others lack carbon. 

Any one of these failings is sufficient, so that not one world in a 
hundred thousand can be lived on. 
Yet this still leaves an estimated 
four million habitable planets. 



The exact number of these which 
are actually occupied is disputable. 
According to the Galactic Almanac, 
admittedly dependent on imperfect 
records, Rhodia was the 1,098th 
world settled by Man. 

Ironically enough, Tyrann, 
eventually Rhodia's conqueror, was 
the 1,099th. 

The pattern of history in the 
Trans-Nebular region was distressingly similar to that elsewhere during the period of development and 
expansion. Planet governments 
were set up in rapid succession, 
each government confined to its 
own world. With expanding economy, neighboring planets were 
colonized and integrated with the 
home society. Small "empires" were 
established and these inevitably 
clashed. 

Hegemony over sizable regions 
was established by first one, then 
another of these governments, depending upon the fluctuations of 
the fortunes of war and of leadership. 

ONLY Rhodia maintained a 
lengthy stability, under the 
able dynasty of the Hinriads. It 
was perhaps well on the road to 
finally establishing a universal 
Trans-Nebular Empire in a stolid 
century or two, when the Tyranni 
came and did the job in ten years. 

Ironical that it should be the men 
of Tyrann. Until then, during the 
seven hundred years of its existence, 
Tyrann had done little better than 



38 




 



maintain a precarious autonomy, 
thanks largely to the undesirability 
of its barren landscape, which, because of a planetary water-dearth, 
was largely desert. 

But even after the Tyranni came, 
the Directorship of Rhodia continued. It had actually grown. The 
Hinriads were popular with the 
people, so their existence served as 
a means of easy control. The Tyranni did not care who got the 
cheers as long as they themselves 
received the booty and power. 

To be sure, the Directors were 
no longer the Hinriads of old. The 
Directorship had always been elective within the family so that the 
ablest might be chosen. Adoptions 
into the family had been encouraged for the same purpose. 

But now the Tyranni could influence the elections for other reasons, and twenty years earlier, for 
instance, Hinrik (fifth of that 
name) had been chosen Director. 
To the Tyranni, it had seemed a 
useful choice. 

Hinrik had been a handsome 
man at the time of his election, and 
he still made an impressive appearance when he addressed the Rhodian Council. His hair had grayed 
smoothly and his thick mustache 
remained, startlingly enough, as 
black as his daughter's eyes. 

At the moment, he faced his 
daughter, and she was furious. She 
lacked only two inches of his 
height, and the Director lacked 
less than an inch of six feet. She 



was a smoldering girl, dark of hair 
and of eyes, and, at the moment, 
loweringly dark of complexion. 

She said, again, "I can't do it!" 

Hinrik said pleadingly, "But, 
Arta, this is unreasonable. What 
am I to do? What can I do? In my 
position, what choice have I?" 

"If mother were alive, she 
would find a way out." She stamped her foot. Her full name was 
Artemisia, a royal name that had 
been borne by at least one female 
of the Hinriads in every generation. 

"Yes, yes, no doubt. Bless my 
soul, what a way your mother had 
with her. There are times when 
you seem all of her and none of 
me. But surely, Arta, you haven't: 
given him a chance. Have you observed his — ah — better points?" 

"TTTHICH are?" 

VV "The ones which . . ." 
He gestured vaguely, thought a 
while and gave It up. He approached her and would have put 
a consoling hand upon her shoulder, but she squirmed away from 
him, her scarlet gown shimmering 
in the air. 

"I have spent an evening with 
him," she said, bitterly, "and he 
tried to kiss me. It was disgusting!" 

"But everyone kisses, dear. It's 
not as though this were your grandmother's time. Kisses are nothing, 
less than nothing. Young blood, 
Arta, young blood!" 

"Young blood, my foot. The 



TYRANN 



3? 



only time that horrible little man 
has had young blood in him these 
fifteen years has been immediately 
after a transfusion. He's four 
inches shorter than I am, father. 
How can I be seen in public with 
a pygmy?" 

"He's an important man. Very 
important!" 

"That doesn't add a single inch 
to his height. He is bowlegged, as 
they all are, and his breath smells." 

"His breath smells?" 

ARTEMISIA wrinkled her nose 
at her father. "That's right; 
it has an unpleasant odor. I didn't 
like it and I made sure to let him 
know it." 

Hinrik dropped his jaw wordlessly for a moment, then said in 
a hoarse half -whisper, "You let 
him know it? You implied that a 
high official of the Royal Court of 
Tyrann could have an unpleasant 
personal characteristic?" 

"He did! I have a nose, you 
know! So when he got too close, I 
just held it and pushed. A figure 
of man to admire, that one is. He 
went flat on his back, with his legs 
sticking up." She gestured with 
her fingers in illustration, but it 
was lost on Hinrik, who, with a 
moan, hunched his shoulder and 
put his hands over his face. 

He peered miserably from between two fingers. "What will 
happen now? How can you act 
so?" 

"It didn't do me any good. Do 



you know what he said? Do you 
have any idea what he said? It was 
the last straw. It was absolutely 
the limit. I made up my mind then 
that I couldn't stand that man if 
he were ten feet tall." 

"But what did he say?" 

"He said — straight out of a 
video, father — he said, 'Ha! A 
spirited wench! I like her all the 
better for that!' And two servants 
helped stagger him to his feet. But 
he didn't try to breathe in my face 
again." 

Hinrik doubled into a chair, 
leaned forward and regarded Artemisia earnestly. "You could go 
through the motions of marrying 
him, couldn't you? You needn't be 
in earnest. Why not merely for the 
sake of political necessity. . .?" 

"How do you mean, not in earnest, father? Shall I cross the fingers 
of my left hand while signing the 
contract with my right?" 

Hinrik looked confused. "No, of 
course not. What good would that 
do? How would crossing fingers 
alter the validity of the contract? 
Really, Arta, I'm surprised at your 
stupidity." 

Artemisia sighed. "What do you 
mean, then?" 

"Mean by what? You see, you've 
disrupted things. I can't keep my 
mind on matters properly when 
you argue with me. What was I 
saying?" 

"I was merely to pretend I was 
getting married, or something. Remember?" 



40 




 



"Oh, yes. I mean, you needn't 
take it too seriously, you see." 
"I can have lovers, I suppose." 

H1NRIK stiffened and frowned. 
"Arta! I brought you up to be 
a modest, self-respecting girl. So 
did your mother. How can you say 
such things? It's shameful." 

"But isn't that what you mean?" 
"I can say it. I am a man, a mature man. A girl like you ought 
not to repeat it." 

"Well, I have repeated it and I 
don't see how talking is worse than 
doing. I'll probably have to have 
them if I'm forced to marry for 
reasons of state, but there are limits." She placed her hands upon 
her hips, and the capelike sleeves 
of her gown slithered away from 
her tanned and dimpled shoulders. 
"But he would still be my husband 
and I just can't bear that particular thought." 

"He's an old man, my dear. Life 
with him would be short." 

"Not short enough, thank you. 
Five minutes ago, he had young 
blood. Remember?" 

Hinrik spread his hands wide 
and let them drop. "Arta, the man 
is a Tyrannian, and a powerful one. 
He is in good odor at the Khan's 
court." 

"The Khan might think it's a 
good odor. He probably would. He 
must smell even worse — maybe that 
is how they judge rank, by rankness." 

Hinrik's mouth was an O of 



horror. Automatically, he looked 
over his shoulder. Then he said, 
hoarsely, "Don't ever say anything 
like that again." 

"I will if I feel like it. Besides, 
the man has had three wives already." She forestalled him, "Not 
the Khan, the man you want me 
to marry." 

"But they're dead," Hinrik explained, earnestly. "Arta, they're 
not alive. Don't think that. How 
can you imagine I would let my 
daughter marry a bigamist? We'll 
have him produce documents. He 
married them consecutively, not 
simultaneously, and they're dead 
new, entirely dead, all of them." 

"It's no wonder." 

"Oh, bless my soul, what shall 
I do?" He made a last effort at 
dignity. "Arta, it is the price of 
being a Hinriad and a Director's 
daughter." 

"I didn't ask to be a Hinriad 
and a Director's daughter." 

"That has nothing to do with 
it. It is just that the history of all 
the Galaxy, Arta, shows that there 
are occasions when reasons of 
State, the safety of planets, the best 
interests of peoples, require that — 
uh. ..." 

"That some poor girl prostitute 
herself." 

"Oh, this vulgarity! Someday, 
you'll see, someday you'll blurt 
something of the sort in public." 

"Well, that's what it is, and I 
won't do it. I'd rather die. I'd 
rather do anything. And I will." 



TYRANN 



41 



The Director got to his feet and 
held out his arms to her. His lips 
trembled and he said nothing. She 
ran to him in a sudden agony of 
tears and clung desperately to him. 
"I can't. Don't make me." 

He patted her awkwardly. "But 
if you don't, what will happen? If 
the Tyranni are displeased, they 
will remove me, imprison me, 
maybe even exec — " He gagged on 
the word. "These are very unhappy 
times, Arta, very unhappy. The 
Rancher of Widemos was condemned last week and I believe he 
has been executed. You remember 
him, Arta? He was at court half a 
year ago. A big man, with a round 
head and deep-set eyes. You were 
frightened of him at first." 

"I remember." 

"Well, he is probably dead. And 
who knows, myself next, perhaps. 
Your poor, harmless old father 
next. It is a bad time. He was at 
our court and that's very suspicious." 

SHE suddenly held herself out at 
arm's length. "Why should it 
be suspicious? You weren't involved with him, were you?" 

"I? Indeed not. But if we openly insult the Khan of Tyrann by 
refusing an alliance with one of his 
favorites, they may choose to think 
even that." 

Hinrik's hand-wringing was interrupted by the muted buzz of the 
extension. He started uneasily. 
"I'll take it in my own room. 



You just rest. You'll feel better 
after a nap. You'll see, you'll see. 
It's just that you're a little on edge 
now." 

Artemisia looked after him and 
frowned. Her face was intensely 
thoughtful, and for minutes only 
the gentle tide of her breasts betrayed life. 

There was the sound of stumbling feet at the door. She turned. 

'What is it?" The tone was 
sharper than she had intended. 

It was Hinrik, his face sallow 
with fear. "Major Andros was calling." 

"Of the Outer Police?" 

Hinrik could only nod. 

Artemisia cried, "Surely, he's 
not. 4 . ." She paused reluctantly 
at the threshold of "putting the horrible thought into words, but waited in vain for enlightenment. 

"There is a young man who 
wants audience. I don't know him. 
Why should he come here? He's 
from Earth." He was gasping for 
breath and shivering as he spoke, 
as though his mind were on a 
turn-table and he had to follow it 
in its gyrations. 

The girl ran to him and seized 
his elbow. She said, sharply, "Sit 
down, father. Tell me what has 
happened." She shook him and 
some of the panic drained out of 
his face. 

"I don't know exactly," he whispered. "There's a young man coming here with details concerning a 
plot on my life. On my life! And 



42 




 



they tell me I ought to listen to 
him." He smiled foolishly. "I'm 
loved by the people. No one would 
want to kill me. Would they?" 

He was watching her eagerly, 
and relaxed when she said. "Of 
course, no one would want to kill 
you." 

Then he was tense again. "Do 
you think it might be they?" 
"Who?" 

He leaned over to whisper, "The 
Tyranni. The Rancher of Widemos 
was here yesterday, and they killed 
him." His voice ascended the scale. 
"And now they're sending someone over to kill me." 

Artemisia gripped his shoulder 
with such force that his mind 
turned to the present pain. 

She said, "Father! Sit quietly! 
Not a word ! Listen to me. No one 
wi!l kill you. Do y6u hear me? No 
one will kill you. It was six. months 
ago that the Rancher was here. Do 
you remember? Wasn't it six 
months ago? Think!" 

"So long ago?" whispered the 
Director. "Yes, yes, it must have 
been." 

"Now you stay here and rest. 
You're overwrought. I'll see the 
young man myself and then ■ I'll 
bring him to you if it's safe." 

"Will you, Arta? Will you? He 
won't hurt a woman. Surely, he 
wouldn't hurt a woman." 

She bent suddenly and kissed 
his cheek. 

"Be careful," he murmured, and 
closed his eyes wearily. 



CHAPTER VI 

That Wears a Crown! 

BIRON FARRILL waited uneasily in one of the outer 
buildings on the Palace Grounds. 
Fot the first time in his life, he 
experienced the deflating sensation 
of being a provincial. 

Widemos Hall, where he had 
grown up, had been beautiful in 
his eyes, and now his memory endowed it with a merely barbaric 
glitter. Its curved lines, its filigree 
work, its curiously wrought turrets, 
its elaborate "false-windows" — He 
winced at the thought of them. 

Earth was mellower, but it was 
minute and dreaming. The public 
buildings had been of white, glossy 
stone; the private homes, of plastic "near-stone" in pastel shades. 
The net effect had been one of 
gingerbread and sugar-candy. It 
was a toy world. 

But this ? This was different. 
The Palace Grounds of Rhodia 
was no mere lump of .ostentation 
built by the petty lords of a cattle 
kingdom; nor was it the childlike 
expression of a fading and dying 
world. It was the culmination, in 
stone, of the Hinriad dynasty. 

The buildings were strong and 
quiet. Their lines were straight and 
vertical, lengthening toward the 
center of each structure, yet avoiding anything as effeminate as a 
spire effect. They held a bluntness 
about them, yet lifted into a climax 



TYRANN 



43 



that affected the onlooker without 
revealing their method of doing so 
at a casual glance. They were reserved, . self-contained, proud. 

And as each building was, so 
was the group as a whole, the huge 
Palace Central becoming . a crescendo. One by one, even the few 
artificialities remaining in the masculine Rhodian style had dropped 
away. The very "false-windows," 
so valued as decoration and so useless in a building of artificial light 
and ventilation, were done away 
with. And that, somehow, without 
loss. 

It was only line and plane, a 
geometrical abstraction that led the 
eye upward to the sky. 

The Tyrannian major stopped 
briefly at his side as he left the 
inner room. 

"You will be received now." 

Biron nodded, and after a while 
a larger man in a uniform of scarlet and tan clicked heels before 
him. It struck Biron with sudden 
force that those who had the real 
power did. not need the outward 
show and could be satisfied with 
slate-blue. He recalled the splendid 
formality of a Rancher's life and 
bit his lip at the thought of its 
futility. 

"Biron Malaine?" said the 
Rhodian guard, and Biron rose to 
follow. 

THERE was a little gleaming 
monorail carriage that was suspended delicately by diamagnetic 



forces upon a single ruddy shaft of 
metal. Biron had never seen one 
before. He paused before entering. 

The little carriage, big enough 
for five or six at the most, swayed 
with the wind, a graceful teardrop 
returning the gleam of Rhodia's 
splendid sun. The single rail was 
slender, scarcely more than a cable, 
and ran the length of the carriage's 
underside without touching. Biron 
bent and saw blue sky all the length 
between them. For a moment, as 
he watched, a lifting gust of wind 
raised it, so that it hovered a full 
inch above the rail, as though impatient for flight and tearing at the 
invisible force-field that held it. 
Then it fluttered back to the rail, 
closer and still closer, but never 
touching. 

"Get in," said the guard behind 
him, impatiently, and Biron climbed two steps into the carriage. 

The steps remained long enough 
for the guard to follow, then lifted 
quietly and smoothly into place, 
forming no break in the carriage's 
even exterior. 

Biron became aware that the 
outer opacity of the carriage was 
an illusion. Once within, he found 
himself sitting in a transparent 
bubble. At the motion of a small 
control, the carriage lifted upward. 
It climbed the heights easily, buffeting at the atmosphere which 
whistled past. For one moment, 
Biron caught the panorama of the 
Palace Grounds from the apex of 
the arc. 



44 




 



The structures became a gorgeous whole — could they have been 
originally conceived other than as 
an air-view? — laced by the shining 
copper threads, along one or two 
of which the graceful carriagebubbles skimmed. 

He felt himself pressed forward, 
and the carriage came to a dancing 
halt. The entire run had lasted less 
than two minutes. 

A door stood open .before him. 
He entered and it closed behind 
him. There was no one in the 
room, which was small and bare. 



For the moment, no one was pushing him, but he felt no comfort 
because of it. He was under no 
illusions. Ever since that damned 
night, others had forced his moves. 

Jonti had placed him on the ship. 
The Tyrannian Commissioner had 
placed him here. And each move 
had increased the measure of his 
desperation. 

It was obvious to Biron that the 
Tyrannian had not been fooled. It 
had been too easy to get away from 
him. The Commissioner might have 
called the Terrestrial consul. He 



TYRANN 



45 



night have hyper-waved Earth, or 
taken his retinal patterns. These 
things were routine, could not have 
been omitted accidentally. 

He remembered Jonti's analysis 
of affairs. Some of it might still be 
valid. The Tyranni would not kill 
•him outright to create another 
martyr. But Hinrik was their puppet, and he was* as capable as they 
of ordering an execution. In that 
case, Biron would have been killed 
by one of his own, and the Tyranni 
merely be disdainful onlookers. 

Biron clenched his fists tightly. 
He was tall and strong, but he was 
unarmed. The men who would 
come for him would have blasters 
and neuronic whips. He found 
himself backing against the wall. 

HE WHIRLED quickly at the 
small sound of the opening 
door to his left. The man who entered was armed and uniformed, 
but there was a girl with him. He 
relaxed a bit. At another time, he 
might have observed the girl closely, since she was worth observation 
and approval, but at the moment 
she was only a girl. 

They approached together, stopping some six feet away. He kept 
his eye on the guard's blaster. 

The girl said to the guard, "I'll 
speak to him first, lieutenant." 

There was a little vertical line 
between her eyes, as she turned to 
him. She said, "Are you the man 
who has this story of an assassination plot against the Director?" 



Biron said, "I was told I would 
see the Director." 

"That is impossible. If you have 
anything to say, say it to me. If 
your information is truthful and 
useful, you will be well-treated." 

"May I ask who you are? How 
do I know you are authorized to 
speak for the Director?" 

The girl seemed annoyed. "I am 
his daughter. Please answer my 
questions. Are you from outside 
the System?" 

"I am from Earth." Biron 
paused, then added, "Your Grace." 

The addition pleased her. 
"Where is that?" 

"It is a small planet of the Sirian 
sector, your Grace." 

"And what is your name?" 
"Biron Malaine, your Grace." 
She stared at him thoughtfully. 
"From Earth? Can you pilot a 
spaceship?" 

Biron almost smiled. She was 
testing him. She knew very well 
that space-navigation was one of 
the forbidden sciences in the 
Tyranni-controlled worlds. 

He said, "Yes, your Grace." He 
could prove that when the performance test came, // they let him 
live that long. Space-navigation was 
not a forbidden science on Earth, 
and in four years one could learn 
much. 

She said, "Very well. And your 
story?" 

He made his decision suddenly. 
To the guard alone, he would not 
have dared. But this was a girl, 



At 




 



and if she was not lying, if she 
really was the Director's daughter, 
she might be a persuasive factor on 
his behalf. 
He said, "There is no assassination plot, your Grace." 

The girl was startled. She turned 
impatiently to her companion. 
"Would you take over, lieutenant? 
Get the truth out of him." 

Biron took a step forward and 
met the cold thrust of the guard's 
blaster. He said, urgently, "Wait, 
your Grace. Listen to me! It was 
the only way to see the Director. 
Don't you understand?" 

He raised his voice and sent it 
after her retreating form: "Will 
you tell his Excellency, at least, 
that I am Biron Farrill and claim 
my Sanctuary Right?" 

It was a feeble straw at which to 
clutch. The old feudal customs had 
been losing their force with the 
generations even before the Tyranni came. Now they were archaisms. But there was nothing else. 
Nothing. 

SHE turned, and her eyebrows 
were arched. "Are you claiming now to be of the aristocratic 
order? A moment ago, your name 
was Malaine." 

A new voice sounded unexpectedly. "So it was, but it is the second 
name which is correct. You are 
Biron Farrill indeed, my good sir. 
Of course you are. The resemblance 
is unmistakable." 

A small, smiling man stood in 



the doorway. His eyes, widely 
spaced and brilliant, were taking 
in all of Biron with an amused 
sharpness. He cocked his narrow 
face upward at Biron's height and 
said to the girl, "Don't you recognize him, too, Artemisia?" 

Artemisia hurried to him, her 
voice troubled. "Uncle Gil, what 
are you doing here?" 

"Taking care of my interests, 
Artemisia. Remember that if there 
were an assassination, I would be 
the closest of the Hinriads to the 
possible succession." Gillbret oth 
Hinriad winked elaborately, then 
added, "Oh, get the lieutenant out 
of here. There isn't any danger." 

She ignored that and said, 
"Have you been sounding the communicator again?" 

"Of course. Would you deprive 
me of an amusement? It is pleasant to eavesdrop on them." 

"Not if they catch you." 

"The danger is part of the game, 
my dear. The amusing part. After 
all, the Tyranni do not hesitate to 
sound the Palace. We can't do 
much without their knowing. Well, 
turnabout, you know. Aren't you 
going to introduce me?" 

"No, I'm not," she said, shortly. "This is none of your business." 

"Then I'll introduce you. When 
I heard his name, I stopped listening and came in." He moved past 
Artemisia, stepped up to Biron, inspected him with an impersonal 
smile, and said, "This is Biron 
Farrill." 



TYRANN 



47 



"I have said so myself," said 
Biron. More than half his attention 
was upon the lieutenant, who still 
held his neuronic whip in firing position. 

"But you have not added that 
you are the son of the Rancher of 
Widemos." 

"I would have, but for your interruption. In any case, you've got 
the story now. Obviously, I had to 
get away from the Tyranni and 
that without giving them my real 
name." Biron waited. This was it, 
he felt. If the next move was not 
an immediate arrest, there was still 
a trifling chance. 

Artemisia said, "I see. This is a 
matter for the Director then. You 
are sure there is no plot?" 

"None, your Grace." 

"Good. Uncle Gil, will you remain with Mr. Farrill? Lieutenant, 
come with me." 

Biron felt weak. He would have 
lilced to sit down, but no suggestion to that effect was made by 
Gillbret, who still inspected him 
with an almost clinical interest. 

"The Rancher's son! Amusing!" 

Biron brought his attention 
downward. He was tired of cautious monosyllables and careful 
phrases. He said, abruptly, "Yes, 
the Rancher's son. It is a congenital situation. Can I help you in any 
other way?" 




ILLBRET showed no offense. 
iHis thin face merely creased 



further as his smile widened. He 



said, "You might satisfy my curiosity. You really came for Sanctuary? 
Here?" 

"I'd rather discuss that with the 
Director, sir." 

"Oh, get off it, yOung man. 
You'll find that very little business 
can be done with the Director. Why 
do you suppose you had to deal 
with his daughter just now? That's 
an amusing thought, if you'll consider it." 

"Do you find everything amusing?" 

"Why not? As an attitude toward life, it's an amusing one. It's 
the only adjective that will fit. Observe the universe, young man. If 
you can't force amusement out of 
it, you might as well cut your 
throat, since there's damned little 
good in it. I haven't introduced 
myself, by the way. I'm the Director's cousin." 

Biron said coldly, "Congratulations." 

Gillbret shrugged. "You're 
right. It's not impressive. And I'm 
likely to remain just that indefinitely since there is no assassination to 
be expected, after all." 

"Unless you whip one up for 
yourself." 

"My dear sir, your sense of humor! You'll have to get used to 
the fact that nobody takes me 
seriously. My remark was only an 
expression of cynicism. You don't 
suppose the Directorship is worth 
anything these days, do you? Surely you cannot believe that Hinrik 



48 




 



was always like this. He was never 
a great brain, but with every year 
he becomes more impossible. I forget, you haven't seen him yet. But 
you will! I hear him coming. 
When he speaks to you, remember that he is the ruler of the largest of the Trans-Nebular kingdoms. 
It wjjl be an amusing thought." 

Hinrik bore his dignity with the 
ease of experience. He acknowledged Biron's painstakingly ceremonious bow with the proper 
degree of condescension. He said, 
showing a trace of abruptness, 
"And your business with us, sir?" 

Artemisia was standing at her 
father's side, and Biron noticed, 
with some surprise, that she was 
quite pretty. He said, "Your Excellency, I have come on behalf of 
my father's good name. You must 
know his execution was unjust." 

Hinrik looked away. "I knew 
your father slightly. He was in 
Rhodia once or twice." He paused, 
and his voice quavered a bit. "You 
are very like him. Very. But he was 
tried, you know. At least I imagine 
he was. And according to law. 
Really, I don't know the details." 

. "Exactly, your Excellency. But I 
would like to learn those details. 
I am sure that my father was no 
traitor." 

HINRIK broke in hurriedly, "As 
his son, of course, it is understandable that you should defend your father, but, really, it is 
difficult to discuss such matters of 



state now. Highly irregular, in fact, 
Why don't you see Aratap?" 

"I do not know him, Excellency." 

"Aratap? The Commissioner? 
The Tyrannian Commissioner?" 

"I have seen him and he sent 
me here. Surely, you understand 
that I dare not let the Tyranni — " 

But Hinrik had grown stiff. His 
hand had wandered to his lips, as 
though to keep them from trembling and his words were consequently muffled. "Aratap sent you?" 

"I found it necessary to tell 
him — " 

"Don't repeat "what you told 
him; I know," said Hinrik. "I can 
do nothing for you, Rancher — uh — 
Mr. Farrill. It is not in my jurisdiction alone. The Executive Council — stop pulling at me, Arta. How 
can I pay attention to matters when 
you distract me? — must be consulted. Gillbret! Will you see that 
Mr. Farrill is taken care of? I will 
do what can be done. Yes, I will 
consult the Executive Council. The 
forms of law, you know. Very important. Very important." 

He turned on his heel, mumbling. 

Artemisia lingered for a moment, and touched Biron's sleeve. 
"A moment. Was it true, your 
statement that you could pilot a 
spaceship?" 

"Quite true," said Biron. He 
smiled at her and after a moment's 
hesitation, she smiled briefly in return. 



TYRANN 



49 



"GilLbret," she said, "I want to 
speak to you later." 

She hurried off. Biron looked 
after her, till Gillbret tweaked at 
his sleeve. 

, "I presume you are hungry, perhaps thirsty, would like a wash?" 
asked Gillbret. "The ordinary 
amenities of life continue, I take 
it?" 

"Thank you, yes," said Biron. 
The tension had almost entirely 
washed out of him. For a moment, 
he was relaxed and felt wonderful. 
She was pretty. Very pretty. 

Hinrik, on the other hand, was 
not relaxed. In his own chambers, 
his thoughts whirled at a feverish 
pace. Try as he might, he could 
not wriggle out of the inevitable 
conclusion. It was a trap! Aratap 
had sent him and it was a trap ! 

Pie buried his head in his hands 
to quiet and deaden the pounding, 
and then he knew what he had to 
do. 

CHAPTER VII 

Musician of the Mind 

NIGHT settles in time on all 
habitable planets. Not always, perhaps, at respectable intervals, since recorded periods of 
rotation vary from fifteen to fiftytwo hours. That fact requires the 
most strenuous psychological adjustment for those traveling from 
planet to planet. 

On many planets, such adjust


ments are made and the wakingsleeping periods are tailored to fit. 
On many more, the almost universal use of conditioned atmospheres and artificial lighting makes 
the day-night question secondary, 
except insofar as it modifies agriculture. On a few planets — those 
of the extremes — arbitrary divisions 
are made which ignore the trivial 
facts of light and dark. 

But always, whatever the social 
conventions, the coming of night 
has a deep and abiding psychological significance, dating back to 
Man's pre-human arboreal existence. Night will always be a time 
of fear and insecurity, and the 
heart will sink with the Sun. 

Inside Palace Central, there was 
no sensory mechanism by which 
one could tell the coming of night, 
yet Biron felt that coming through 
some indefinite instinct hidden in 
the unknown corridors of the human brain. He knew that outdoors, 
the night's blackness was scarcely 
relieved by the futile sparks of the 
stars. He knew that, if it were the 
right time of year, the jagged "hole 
in space" known as the Horsehead 
Nebula, so familiar to all the 
Trans-Nebular Kingdoms, inked 
out half the stars that might otherwise have been visible. 

And he was depressed again. 

He had not seen Artemisia since 
the little talk with the Director and 
he found himself resenting that. 
He had looked forward to dinner; 
he might have spoken to her. In


50 




 



stead he had eaten alone, with two 
guards lounging discontentedly 
just outside the door. Even Gillbret had left him, presumably to 
eat a less lonely meal in the company one would expect in a palace 
of the Hinriads. 

So that when Gillbret returned 
and said, "Artemisia and I have 
been discussing you," he obtained 
a prompt and interested reaction. 

It merely amused him and he 
said so. "First, however, I want to 
show you my laboratory," he 
added. He gestured and the two 
guards moved off. 

"What kind of laboratory?" 
asked Biron with a definite loss of 
interest. 

"I build gadgets," was the 
vague response. 

IT WAS not a laboratory to the 
' eye. It was more nearly a 
library, with an ornate desk in the 
corner. 

Biron looked it over slowly. 
"And you build gadgets here? 
What kind of gadgets?" 

"Well, special sounding devices 
to spy out the Tyranni spy-beams, 
in a brand-new way. Nothing they 
can detect. That's how I found out 
about you, when the first word 
came through from Aratap. And I 
have other amusing trinkets. My 
visi-sonor, for instance. Do you 
like music?" 

"Some kinds." 

"•Good. I invented an instrument, only I don't know if you 



can properly call it music." A shelf 
of book-films slid out and aside at 
a touch. "This is not really much 
of a hiding-place, but nobody takes 
me seriously, so they don't look. 
Amusing, don't you think? But I 
forget, you're the unamused one." 

It was a clumsy, boxlike affair, 
with that singular lack of gloss and 
polish that marks the home-made 
object. One side of it was studded 
with little gleaming knobs. He put 
it down with that side upward. 

"It isn't pretty," Gillbret said, 
"but who in Time cares? Put the 
lights out. No, no! No switches 
or contacts. Just wish the lights 
were out. Wish hard! Decide you 
want them out." 

And the lights dimmed with the 
exception of the faint pearly luster 
of the ceiling that made them two 
ghostly faces in the dark. Gillbret 
laughed lightly at Biron's exclamation. 

"Just one of the tricks of my 
visi-sonor. It's keyed to the mind 
just as personal message capsules 
are. Do you know what I mean?" 

"No, I don't, if you want a plain 
answer." 

"Well," Gillbret said, "look at 
it this way. The electric field of 
your brain cells sets up an induced 
one in the instrument. Mathematically, it's fairly simple, but as far 
as I know, no one has ever jammed 
all the necessary circuits into a box 
this size before. Usually, it takes a 
five-story generating plant to do it. 
It works the other way, too. I can 



TYRANN 



51 



close circuits here and impress 
them directly upon your brain, so 
that you'll see and hear without 
any intervention of eyes and ears. 
Watch!" 

There was nothing to watch at 
first, and then something fuzzy 
scratched faintly at the corner of 
Biron's eyes. It became a faint blueviolet ball hovering in mid-air. It 
followed him as he turned away, 
remained unchanged when he 
closed his eyes. And a clear, musical tone accompanied it, was part 
of it, was it. 

IT WAS growing and expanding 
and Biron became disturbingly 
aware that it existed inside his 
skull. It wasn't really a color, but 
rather a colored sound, though 
without noise. It was tactile, yet 
without feeling. 

It spun and took on an iridescence while the musical tone rose 
in pitch till it hovered above him 
like falling silk. Then it exploded 
so that gouts of color splattered at 
him in touches that burnt momentarily and left no pain. 

Bubbles of rain-drenched green 
rose again with a quiet, soft moaning. Biron thrust at them in confusion and became aware that he 
could not see his hands or feel 
them move. There was nothing, 
only the little bubbles filling his 
mind to the exclusion of all else. 

He cried out soundlessly and the 
fantasy ceased. Gillbret was standing before him once again in a 



lighted room, laughing. Biron felt 
an acute dizziness and wiped shakily at a chilled, moist forehead. He 
sat down abruptly. 

"What happened?" he demanded, in as. stiff a tone as he could 
manage. 

Gillbret said, "I don't know. I 
stayed out of it. You don't understand? It was something your brain 
had lacked previous experience 
with. Your brain Was sensing directly -and it had no method of 
interpretation for such a phenomenon. So as long as you concentrated on the sensation, your brain 
could only attempt, futilely, to 
force the effect into the old, familiar pathways. It attempts separately 
and simultaneously to interpret ic 
as sight and sound and touch. Were 
you conscious of an odor, by the 
way? Sometimes it seemed to me 
that I smelled the stuff. With dogs 
I imagine the sensation would be 
forced almost entirely into odor. 
I'd like to try it on animals some 
day. 

"On the other hand, if you 
ignore it, make no attack upon it, 
it fades away. It's what I do when 
I want to observe its effects on 
others, and it isn't difficult." 

He placed a little • veined hand 
upon the instrument, fingering the 
knobs aimlessly. "Sometimes I 
think that if One could really study 
this thing, one could compose 
symphonies in a new medium; do 
things one could never do with 
simple sound or sight. I lack the 



52 




 



capacity for it, I'm afraid. However, just a light touch, not enough 
to confuse the established mental 
patterns, is sometimes rather interesting. It heightens perception, 
releases the psychological censor, 
accentuates wishful thinking . . . 
or expectant dread." 

He moved the knobs minutely 
before Biron could object. The 
moaning now was sweet cerebral 
music, which, for an instant, 
threatened to become, hollowly 
menacing before Biron thought of 
Arta. He thought of her and she 
was real against the background 
of the room and Gillbret with the 
box of dreams in his hand. The 
music rose to hungry longing more 
intense than any emotion Biron 
had ever experienced. She was 
beautiful and he wanted her. . . . 

IT ENDED and she was gone; 
he still stood with his fists tight 
and his heart beating in race 
rhythm. Gillbret looked hastily 
down at the sono-visor, as though 
embarrassed by the intensity of 
Biron's visible yearning. He should 
have been amused, yet he was not, 
and Biron, relaxing unhappily, was 
grateful for that. 

"I suppose it could have great 
therapeutic value," said Gillbret, 
"by revealing to us our suppressed 
wishes and fears — " 

"I'd like to ask you a question," 
Biron said, abruptly. 
"By all means." 
"Why don't you put your scien


tific ability to worthwhile use instead of — " 

"Wasting it on useless toys? I 
don't know. It may not be entirely 
useless. This is against the law, you 
know." 

"What is?" 

"The visi-sonor. Also my spy 
devices. If the Tyranni knew, it 
could easily mean a death sentence." 

"Surely, you're joking." 

"Not at all. It is obvious that 
you were brought up on a cattle 
ranch. The young people cannot 
even remember what it was like in 
the old days, I see." Suddenly, his 
head was to one side and his eyei 
were narrowed to slits. He asked, 
"Are you opposed to Tyranni rule? 
Speak freely. I tell you frankly that 
/ am. I tell you also that your 
father was." 

Biron said, calmly, "Yes, I am." 

"Why?" 

"They are strangers, outlanders. 
What right have they to rule in 
Nephelos or in Rhodia?" 

"Have you always thought that?" 

Biron did not answer. 

Gillbret sniffed. "In other 
words, you decided they were 
strangers and outlanders only after 
they executed your father, which, 
after all, was their simple right. 
Oh, look, don't fire up. Consider 
it reasonably. Believe me, I'm on 
your side. But think! Your father 
was Rancher. What rights did his 
herdsmen have? If one of them 
had stolen cattle for his own use 



TYRANN 



53 



or to sell to others, what would 
have been his punishment? Imprisonment as a thief. If he had plotted the death of your father, for 
whatever reason, for perhaps a 
worthy reason in his own eyes, 
what would have been the result? 
Execution, undoubtedly. And what 
right had your father to make laws 
and visit punishment upon his fellow human beings? He was their 
Tyrannian. 

"Your father, in his own eyes 
and in mine, was a patriot. But 
what of that? To the Tyranni, he 
was a traitor and they removed 
him. Can you ignore the necessity 
of self-defense? The Hinriads 
have been a bloody lot in their 
time. Read your history, young 
man. All governments kill as part 
of the nature of things. 

"So find a better reason to hate 
the Tyranni. Don't think it is 
enough to replace one set of rulers 
by another, that the simple change 
brings freedom." 

BIRON pounded a fist impatiently into his cupped palm. "Ail 
this objective philosophy is fine. It 
is very soothing to the man who 
lives apart. But what if it had been 
your father who was murdered?" 

"Well, wasn't it? My father was 
Director before Hinrik and he was 
killed. Oh, not outright, but subtly. They broke his spirit, as they 
are breaking Hinrik's now. They 
wouldn't have me as Director when 
my father died; I was just a little 



too unpredictable. Hinrik was 
tall, handsome, and, above all, 
pliant. Yet not pliant enough, apparently. They hound him continuously, grind him into a pitiful 
puppet, make sure he cannot even 
itch without permission. You've 
seen him. He's deteriorating by the 
day now. His continual state of 
fear is pathetically psychopathic. 
But that, all that, is not why I want 
to destroy Tyrannian rule," 

"No?" said Biron. "You have 
invented an entirely new reason?" 

"An entirely old one, rather. 
The Tyranni are destroying the 
right of twenty billion human beings to take part in the development of the race. You've been to 
school. You've learned the economic cycle. A new planet is 
settled," he was ticking the points 
off t>n his fingers, "and its first 
care is to feed itself. It becomes an 
agricultural world; a herding 
world. It begins to dig in the 
ground for crude ore to export, 
and sends its agricultural surplus 
abroad to buy luxuries and machinery. That is the second step. 
Then, as population increases and 
foreign investments grow, an industrial civilization begins to bud, 
which is the third step. Eventually, 
the world becomes mechanized, importing food, exporting machinery, 
investing in the development of 
more primitive worlds and so on. 
The fourth step. 

"Always the mechanized worlds 
are the most thickly populated, the 



54 




 



most powerful, militarily, since war 
is a function of machines, and they 
are usually surrounded by a fringe 
of agricultural, dependent worlds. 

"But what has happened to us? 
We were at the third step, with 
a growing industry. And now? 
That growth has been stopped, 
frozen, forced to recede. It would 
interfere with Tyrannian control of 
our industrial necessities. It is a 
short-term investment on their part 
because eventually we'll become unprofitable as we become impoverished. But, meanwhile, they skim 
the cream. 

"Besides, if we industrialized 
ourselves, we might develop weapons of war. So industrialization is 
stopped; scientific research is forbidden. And eventually the people 
become so used to that, they lack 
the realization even that anything 
is missing. So that you are surprised when I tell you that I could 
be executed for building a visisonor. 

"fXF COURSE, some day we 
v_y will beat the Tyranni. It is 
fairly certain. They can't rule forever. No one can. They'll grow 
soft and lazy. They will intermarry 
and lose much of their separate 
traditions. They will become corrupt. But it may take cehturies, because history doesn't hurry. And 
when those centuries have passed, 
we will still all be agricultural 
worlds with no industrial or scientific heritage to speak of, while our 



neighbors on all sides, those not 
under Tyrannian control, will be 
strong and urbanized. The Kingdoms will be semi-colonial areas 
indefinitely. They may never catch 
up and we may be merely observers in the great drama of human 
advance." 

Biron said, "What you say is 
not completely unfamiliar." 

"Naturally, if you were educated 
on Earth. Earth occupies a very 
peculiar position in social development." 

"Indeed?" 

"To be sure. All the Galaxy has 
been in a continuous state of expansion since the first discovery of 
interstellar travel. We have always 
been a growing society, therefore 
an immature society. It is obvious 
that that human society reached 
maturity in only one place and in 
only one time and that this was 
on Earth immediately prior to its 
catastrophe. There we had a society which had temporarily lost 
all possibility for geographical expansion and was therefore faced 
with such problems as overpopulation, depletion of resources and so 
on; problems that have never faced 
any other portion of the Galaxy. 

"They were forced to study the 
social sciences intensively. We have 
lost much or all of that and it is a 
pity. Now here's an amusing thing. 
When Hinrik was a young man, 
he was a great Primitivist. He had 
a library on things Earthly that was 
unparalleled in the Galaxy. Since 



TYRANN 



53 



he became Director, that's gone by 
the board along with everything 
else. But, in a way, I've inherited 
it. Their literature, such scraps as 
survive, is fascinating. It has a 
peculiarly introspective flavor to it 
that we don't have in our extroverted Galactic civilization. It is 
most amusing." 

Biron said, "You relieve me. 
You have been serious for so long 
that I began to wonder if you had 
lost your sense of humor." 

Gillbret shrugged. "I am relaxing and it is wonderful. First time 
in months, I think. Do you know 
what it is to play a part? To split 
your personality deliberately for 
twenty-four hours a day? Even 
when with friends? Even when 
alone, so that you will never forget 
inadvertently? To be eternally 
amused? To be of no account? To 
be so effete and faintly ridiculous 
that you have convinced all who 
know you of your own worthlessness? All so that your life might 
be safe, even though it means it 
has become barely worth living. But' 
even so, once in a while, I can fight 
them." 

HE LOOKED up, and his voice 
was earnest, almost pleading. 
' "You can pilot a ship. I cannot. 
Isn't that strange? You talk about 
my scientific ability, yet I cannot 
pilot a simple one-man spacegig. 
But you can, and it follows then 
that you must leave Rhodia." 
There was no mistaking the 



pleading, but Biron frowned coldly. "Why?" 

Gillbret continued, speaking 
rapidly, "As I said, Artemisia and 
I have discussed you and arranged 
this. When you leave here, proceed directly to her room, where 
she is waiting for you. I have 
drawn a diagram so that you won't 
have to ask your way through the 
corridors." He was forcing a small 
sheet of metallene upon Biron. "If 
anyone does stop you, say that you 
have been summoned by the Director, and proceed. There will be 
no trouble, if you show no uncertainty — " 

"Hold on!" said Biron. He was 
not going to do it again. Jonti had 
chivied him to Rhodia and, consequently, succeeded in bringing 
him before the Tyranni. The Tyrannian Commissioner had then 
chivied him to Palace Central* before he could feel his own secret 
way there and, consequently, subjected him, nakedly unprepared, to 
the whims of an unsteady puppet. 
But that was all ! His moves, henceforward, might be severely limited, 
but, by Space and Time, they 
would be his own. He felt very 
stubborn about it. 

He said, "I'm here on what is 
important business to me, sir. I'm 
not leaving." 

"What? Don't be a young idiot." 
For a moment, the old Gillbret 
was showing through. "Do you 
think you will accomplish anything 
here? Do you think you will get 



56 




 



out of the Palace alive if you let 
the morning sun rise? Why, Hinrik will call in the Tyranni and you 
will be imprisoned within twentyfour hours. He is only waiting this 
while because it takes him so long 
to make up his mind to do anything. He is my cousin. I know 
him, I tell you." 

Biron said, "And if so, what is 
that to you? Why should you be 
so concerned about me?" He was 
not going to be chivied. He would 
never again be another man's 
obedient marionette. 

But Gillbret was standing, staring at him. "I want you to take me 
with you. I'm concerned about myself. I cannot endure life under the 
Tyranni any longer. It is only that 
neither Artemisia nor I can handle 
a ship or we would have left long 
ago. It's our lives, too." 

Biron felt a certain weakening 
of his resolve. "The Director's 
daughter? What has she to do 
with this?" 

«T BELIEVE that she is the most 
-L desperate of us. There is a 
special death for women. What 
should be ahead of a Director's 
daughter who is young, personable, 
and unmarried, but to become 
young, personable and married? 
And who, in these days, should be 
the delightful groom? Why, an 
old, lecherous Tyrannian court 
functionary who has buried three 
wives and wishes to revive the fires 
of his youth with a young girl." 



"Surely the Director would never 
allow such a thing." 

"The Director will allow anything. Nobody waits upon his permission." 

Biron thought of Artemisia as 
he had last seen her. Her hair had 
been combed back from her forehead and allowed to fall in simple 
straightness, with a single inward 
wave at shoulder level. Tanned 
skin, black eyes, red lips. Tall, 
young, smiling. Probably the description of a hundred million 
girls throughout the Galaxy. It 
would be ridiculous to let that sway 
him. 

Yet he said, "Is there a ship 
ready?" 

Gillbret's face wrinkled under 
the impact of a sudden smile. But 
before he could say a word, there 
came a pounding at the door. It 
was no gentle interruption of the 
photo-beam, no soft sound of polite knuckles on hard plastic. It 
was the clang of metal, the overpowering thunder of the weapon 
of authority. 

It was repeated, and Gillbret 
said, "You'd better open the 
door." 

Biron did so, and two uniforms 
were in the room. The foremost 
saluted Gillbret with abrupt efficiency, then turned to Biron: 
"Biron Farrill, in the name of the 
Resident Commissioner of Tyrann 
and of the Director of Rhodia, I 
place you under arrest." 

"On what charge?" 



TYRANN 



57 



"High treason." 

A look of infinite loss twisted 
Gillbret's face. He looked away. 
"Hinrik was quick this once; 
ruicker than I had ever expected. 
An amusing thought!" 

He was the old Gillbret, smiling and indifferent, eyebrows a 



little raised, as though inspecting 
a distasteful fact with a faint tinge 
of regret. 

"Very amusing," he said. 

"Please follow me," said the 
guard, and Biron was aware of the 
neuronic whip resting easily in the 
other's hand. 




58 




 



CHAPTER VIII 




TYRANN 



A Lady's Skirts 

B IRON'S throat was growing 
dry. He could have beaten 
either of the guards in fair fight. 
He knew that and he itched for 
the chance. He might even have 
made a satisfactory showing against 
both together. But they had the 
whips and he couldn't have lifted 
an arm without having them paralyze it instantly. Inside his mind, 
he surrendered. There was no 
other way. 

But Gillbret said, "Let him take 
his cloak, 'men." 

Biron, startled, looked quickly 
toward the little man and retracted 
his mental surrender. He had not 
brought a cloak. 

The guard whose weapon was 
out clicked his heels as a gesture 
of respect. He motioned his whip 
at Biron. "You heard Milord. Get 
your cloak and make it quick."" 

Biron stepped back as slowly as 
he dared. He retreated to the bookcase and squatted, groping behind 
the chair for his non-existent cloak. 
And as his fingers clawed at the 
empty space behind the chair, he 
waited tensely for Gillbret. 

The sono- visor was just a queer 
knobbed object to the guards. It 
would mean nothing to them that 
Gillbret fingered the knobs gently. Biron watched the muzzle of 
the whip intensely and allowed it 
to fill his mind. Certainly nothing 

59 



else he saw or heard {thought he 
saw or heard) must enter. 

But how much longer? 

The armed guard said, "Is your 
cloak behind that chair? Stand up!" 
He took an impatient step forward, 
and then stopped. His eyes narrowed in deep amazement and he 
looked sharply at his left. 

That was it! Biron hunched and 
threw himself forward at the 
guard's knees. The guard went 
down with a jarring thud, and Biron's large fist closed over the 
other's hand, grasping for the neuronic whip it held. 

The other guard had his weapon 
out, but for the moment he was 
useless. With his free hand, he was 
brushing wildly at the space before 
his eyes. 

Gillbret's high-pitched laugh 
sounded. "Anything bothering you, 
Farrill?" 

"Don't see a thing," Biron 
grunted, "except this whip I've got 
now." 

"All right, leave then. They 
can't do anything to stop you. Their 
minds are full of sights and sounds 
that don't exist." Gillbret skipped 
out of the way of the writhing 
tangle of bodies. 

Biron wrenched his arms free 
and heaved upward. He brought 
his arm down solidly just below 
the other's ribs. The guard's face 
twisted in agony and his body 
doubled convulsively. Biron rose, 
whip in hand. 

".Careful," cried Gillbret. 



BUT Biron did not turn quickly' 
enough. The second guard was 
bearing him down again. It was a 
blind attack. What it was that the 
guard thought he was grasping, it 
was impossible to tell. That he 
knew nothing of Biron at the moment was certain. His breath rasped 
in Biron's ear and there was a continuous incoherent gurgle bubbling 
in his .throat. 

Biron twisted in an attempt to 
bring his captured weapon into 
play and was frighteningly aware 
of the blank and empty eyes that 
must be staring at some horror invisible to anyone else. 

Biron braced his legs and shifted 
weight in an effort to break loose, 
quite uselessly. Three times he felt 
the guard's whip flung hard against 
his hip, and flinched at the contact. 

And then the guard's gurgle dissolved into words. He yelled, "I'll 
get you all!" and the very pale, 
almost-invisible shimmer of the 
ionized air in the path of the whip's 
energy beam made its frightening 
appearance. It swept wide through 
the air, and the path of the beam 
intersected Biron's foot. 

It was as though he had stepped 
into a bath of boiling lead. Or as 
if a granite block had toppled upon 
it. Or as if it had been crunched 
off by a shark. Actually nothing had 
happened to it physically. It was 
only that the nerve endings that 
governed the sensation of pain had 
been universally and maximally 



60 




 



stimulated. Boiling lead could have 
done no more. 

Biron's yell tore his throat raw, 
and he collapsed. It did not even 
occur to him that the fight was 
over. Nothing mattered but the 
ballooning pain. 

Yet, though Biron did not know 
it, the guard's grip had relaxed, and 
minutes later, when the young man 
could force his eyes open and blink 
away the tears, he found the guard 
backed against the wall, pushing 
feebly at nothing with both hands 
and giggling to himself. The first 
guard was still on his back, arms 
and legs spread-eagled now. He was 
conscious, but silent. His eyes were 
following something in an erratic 
path, and his body quivered a little. There was a little froth on his 
lips. 

Biron forced himself to his feet. 
He limped badly as he made his 
way to the wall. He used the butt 
of the whip and the guard slumped. 
Then back to the first, who made 
no defense either, his eyes moving 
silently to the very moment of unconsciousness. 

Biron sat down again, nursing his 
foot. He stripped shoe and stocking from it, and stared in surprise 
at the unbroken skin. He chafed it 
and grunted at the burning sensation. He looked up at Gillbret, who 
had put down his visi-sonor and 
was now rubbing one lean cheek 
with the back of his hand. 

"Thank you," said Biron, "for 
the help of your instrument." 



Gillbret shrugged. "There'll be 
more here soon. Get to Artemisia's 
room. Please! Quickly!" 

Biron realized the justice of that. 
His foot had subsided to a quiet 
quiver of pain, but it felt swollen 
and puffy. He put on a stocking 
and tucked the shoe under his elbow. He already had one whip, 
and he relieved the second guard of 
the other. He stuffed it precariously 
within his belt. 

He turned at the door and asked 
with a sense of crawling revulsion, 
"What did you make them see?" 

"I don't know. I can't control it. 
I just gave them all the power I 
could and the rest depended on 
their own psychological makeup. 
Please don't stand there talking. Do 
you have the map of Artemisia's 
room?" 

BIRON nodded, and set off 
down the corridor. It was 
empty. He could not walk quickly, 
since trying to do so made his walk 
a hobble. 

He looked at his watch, then remembered that he had somehow 
never had the time to adjust it to 
Rhodian local chronometry. It still 
ran on Standard Interstellar Time as 
used aboard ship, where one hundred minutes made an hour and a 
thousand a day. So the figure 
"876" which gleamed pinkly on the 
cool metal face of the watch meant 
nothing now. 

Still, it had to be well into the 
night, or into the planetary sleep

ing-period, at any rate (supposing 
the two not to coincide), as otherwise the halls would not be so 
empty and the bas-reliefs on the 
wall would not phosphoresce unwatched. He touched one idly as he 
passed, a coronation scene, and 
found it to be two-dimensional. Yet 
it gave the perfect illusion of standing out from the wall. 

It was sufficiently unusual for 
him to stop momentarily in order 
to examine the effect. Then he remembered and hurried on. 

THE emptiness of the corridor 
struck him as another sign of 
the decadence of Rhodia. He had 
grown conscious of these symbols 
of decline now that he had become 
a rebel. As the center of an independent power, the Palace would 
always have had its sentries and its 
quiet wardens of the night. 

He consulted Gillbret's crude 
map and turned to the right, moving up a wide, curving ramp. There 
might have been processions here 
once, but nothing of that would be 
left now. 

He leaned against the proper 
door and touched the photo-signal. 
The door moved ajar a bit, then 
opened wide. 

"Come in, young man." 
It was Artemisia. Biron slipped 
inside and the door closed swiftly 
and silently. He looked at the girl, 
saying nothing. He was gloomily 
conscious of the fact that his shirt 
was torn at the shoulder so that one 



sleeve flapped loosely, that his 
clothes were grimy and his face 
welted. He remembered the shoe he 
was still carrying, dropped it and 
wriggled his foot into it. 

Then he said, "Mind if I sit 
down?" 

She followed him to the chair, 
and stood before him, a little annoyed. "What happened? What's 
wrong with your foot?" 

"I hurt it," he said, shortly. "Are 
you ready to leave?" 

She brightened. "You'll take us, 
then?" 

But Biron was in no mood to be 
sweet about it. His foot still 
twinged and he cradled it. He said, 
"Look, get me out to a ship. I'm 
leaving this damn planet. If you 
want to come along, I'll take you." 

She frowned, "You might be 
more pleasant about it. Were you in 
a fight?" 

"Yes, I was. With your father's 
guards, who wanted to arrest me 
for treason. So much for my Sanctuary Right." 

"Oh! I'm sorry." 

"I'm a lot sorrier. It's no wonder 
the Tyranni can lord it over fifty 
worlds with a handful of men. We 
help them. Men like your father 
would do anything to keep in 
power; they would forget the basic 
duties of a simple gentleman — Oh, 
forget it!" 

"I said I was sorry, Lord Rancher." She used the title with a cold 
pride. "Please don't set yourself up 
as judge of my father." 



62 




 



'Tm not interested in discussing 
it. We'll have to leave in a hurry, 
before more of your father's precious guards come. Well, I didn't 
mean to hurt your feelings. It's all 
right." Biron's surliness cancelled 
out any meaning of his apology, 
but, damn it, he had never been 
hit by a neuronic whip before and 
it wasn't fun. And, by Space, they 
had owed him Sanctuary. 

Artemisia felt angry. Not at her 
father, of course, but at the stupid 
young man. He was so young, 
practically a child, she decided, 
scarcely older than herself, if that. 

The Communicator sounded and 
she said, sharply^ "Please wait a 
minute and we'll go." 

IT WAS Gillbret's voice, sounding faintly. "Arta? All right at 
your end?" 

. "He's here," she whispered back. 

"Fine, fine. Don't say anything. 
Just listen. Don't leave your room. 
Keep him there. There.'s going to be 
a search of the Palace, which 
there's no way of stopping. I'll try 
to think of something, but, meanwhile, don't move." He waited for 
no reply. Contact was broken. 

"So that's that," said Biron. He 
had heard, also. "Shall I stay and 
get you into trouble, or shall I go 
out and give myself up? There's 
no reason to expect Sanctuary anywhere on Rhodia, I suppose." 

She faced him in a rage, crying 
in a choked whisper, "Oh, shut up, 
you big, ugly fool." 



They glared at each other, Biron 
standing on one foot and raging. 
In a way, he was trying to help 
her, too. "There is no reason for 
you to be insulting," he told her, 
just barely controlling his anger. 

She said, "I'm sorry," and looked 
away. 

"I meant your tone of voice, not 
what you said. You're entitled to 
your opinion of me." 

"You don't have to say the 
things you do about my father. You 
don't know what being Director is 
like. He's working for his people, 
whatever you may think." 
. "Oh, sure. He has to sell me to 
the Tyranni for the sake of the 
people. That makes sense." 

"Certainly it does. He has to 
show them he's loyal. Otherwise, 
they might depose him and take 
over the direct rule of Rhodia. 
Would that be better?" 

"If a nobleman can't find Sanctuary — " 

"Oh, you think only of yourself. 
-That's what's wrong with you." 

"I don't think it's particularly 
selfish not to want to die. At least 
for nothing. I've got some fighting 
to do before I go. My father fought 
them." He knew he was beginning 
to sound melodramatic, but she affected him that way. 

She said, "And what good did it 
do your father?" 

"None, I suppose. He was 
killed." 

Artemisia felt unhappy. "I keep 
saying I'm sorry, and this time I

really mean it. I'm all upset." Then, 
in defense, "I'm in trouble, too." 

Biron remembered. "I know. All 
right, let's start all over." He tried 
to smile. His foot was feeling better anyway. 

She said, in an attempt at lightness, "You're not really ugly." 

Biron felt foolish. "Oh, I don't 
know — " 

Then he stopped, and Artemisia's hand flew to her mouth. 

There was the sudden, soft sound 
of many ordered feet on the semielastic plastic mosaic that floored 
the corridor outside. Most passed 
by, but there was a faint, disciplined 
heel-clicking just outside the door, 
and the night signal purred. 

GILLBRET had to work quickly. 
Damn Hinrik for making up 
his mind so quickly this once, for 
not waiting till morning. Gillbret 
had to get away; he might never 
have another chance. But he had to 
hide his sono-visor. For the first 
time, he wished he had a better, 
hiding-place. 

Then he called the captain of the 
guard. He couldn't very well 
neglect a little matter of two unconscious guards and an escaped 
prisoner. 

The captain of the guard was 
grim about it. He had the two unconscious men cleared out, and then 
faced Gillbret. 

"My Lord, I am not quite clear 
from your message exactly what 
happened," he said. 



"Just what you see," said Gillbret. "They came to make their 
arrest, and the young man did not 
submit. He is gone, Space knows 
where." 

"That is of little moment, my 
Lord," said the captain. "The 
Palace is honored tonight with the 
presence of a personage, so it is 
well-guarded despite the hour. He 
cannot get out and we will draw the 
net through the interior. But how 
did he escape ? My men were armed. 
He was not." 

"He fought like a tiger. From 
that chair, behind which I hid — " 

"I am sorry, my Lord, that you 
did not think to aid my men against 
an accused traitor." 

Gillbret looked scornful. "What 
an amusing thought, captain. When 
your men, with doubled advantage 
in numbers and weapons, need help 
from myself, it is time that you recruited yourself other men." 

"Very well. We will search the 
Palace, find him, and see if he can 
repeat the performance." 

"I shall accompany you, captain." 

It was the captain's turn to raise 
his eyebrows. He said, "I would 
not advise it, my Lord. There would 
be some danger." 

It was the kind of remark that 
one did not make to a Hinriad. 
Gillbret knew that, but he only 
smiled and let the wrinkles fill his 
lean face. "I know that," he said, 
"but occasionally I find even danger amusing." 

It took five minutes for the com

pany of guards to assemble. Gillbrer, alone in his room during that 
time, called Artemisia. 

BIRON and Artemisia had 
frozen at the purring of the 
little signal. It sounded a second 
time and then there was the cautious rap upon the door, and Gillbret's voice was heard. 

"Do let me try, captain," it said. 
Then, more loudly, "Artemisia?" 

Biron grinned his relief and took 
a step forward, but the girl put a 
sudden hand upon his mouth. She 
called out, "One moment, Uncle 
Gil," and pointed desperately toward the wall. 

Biron could only stare stupidly. 
The wall was quite blank. Artemisia shook her head impatiently 
and stepped quickly past him. Her 
hand on the- wall caused a portion 
of it to slide noiselessly aside, revealing a dressing room. Her lips 
motioned, "Get inside!" and her 
hands were fumbling at the ornamental pin at her right shoulder. 
The unclasping of that pin broke 
the tiny biostatic force-field that 
held an invisible seam tightly 
closed down the length of the 
dress. She stepped out of it. 

Biron turned around after walking through what had been the 
wall, and its closing lasted just 
long enough for him to see her 
pulling a white-furred dressing 
gown around her proud body. The 
scarlet dress lay crumpled upon the 
chair. 



He looked about him and wondered if they would search Artemisia's room. He was helpless if a 
search took place. There was no 
way out of the dressing-room but 
the way he had entered. 

Along one wall there hung a 
row of gowns, and the air 
shimmered very faintly before it. 
His hand passed easily through the 
shimmer, with only a faint tingling 
where it crossed his wrist, but then 
it was meant to repel only dust so 
that the space behind it could be 
kept aseptically clean. 

He might hide behind the 
skirts. It was what he was doing, 
really. He had manhandled two 
guards, with Gillbret's help, to get 
here, but now that he was here, he 
was hiding behind a lady's skirts. 
A Lady's skirts, in fact. 

Incongruously, he found himself 
wishing he had turned a bit sooner 
before the wall had closed behind 
him. She had quite a remarkable 
figure. It was ridiculous of him to 
have been so childishly nasty a 
while back. Of course, she was not 
to blame for the faults of her 
father. 

And now he could only wait, 
staring at the blank wall; waiting 
for the sound of feet within the 
room, for the wall to pull back 
once more, for the muzzles facing 
him again, this time without a 
sono-visor to help him.

Dark 
Interlude

Justifiable homicide is a solidly established 
point of law, but the justification of murder 
depends on where the killer lives... and when!

eyes were grave. He said, 
K^J "Okay, boy. You feel kind 
of jittery; that's natural. But if your 
story's straight, don't worry. Don't 
worry about nothing. Everything'!! 
be all right, boy." 

"It was three hours ago, Sheriff," 
Allenby said. "I'm sorry it took me 
so long to gel into toivn and that 1 
had to wake you up. But Sis was 



hysterical a while. I had to try and 
quiet her down, and then 1 had 
trouble starting the jalopy." 

"Don't worry about waking me 
up, boy. Being sheriff's a full-time 
job. And it ain't late, anyway; 1 
just happened to turn in early tonight. Now let me get a few things 
straight. You say your name ' s Lou 
Allenby. That's a good name in 
these parts, Allenby. You kin of 




Ranee Allenby, used to run the 
feed business over in Cooperville? 
I went to school with Ranee . . . 
Now about the fella who said he 
come from the future . . ." 

* * * 

THE Presidor of the Historical 
Research Department was skeptical to the last. .He argued, "I am 
still of the opinion that the project 
is not feasible. There are paradoxes 
involved which present insurmountable — " 

Doctr Matthe, the noted physicist, interrupted politely, "Undoubtedly, sir, you are familiar 
with the Dichotomy?" 

The presidor wasn't, so he remained silent to indicate that he 
wanted an explanation. 

"Zeno propounded the Dichotomy. He was a Greek philosopher 
of roughly five hundred years before the ancient prophet whose 
birth was used by the primitives to 
mark the beginning of their calendar. The Dichotomy states that it 
is impossible to- cover any given 
distance. The argument: First, half 
the distance must be traversed, then 
half of the remaining distance, then 
again half of what remains, and so 
on. It follows that some portion of 
the distance to be covered always 
remains, and therefore motion is 
impossible." 

"Not analagous," the presidor 
objected. "In the first place, your 
Greek assumed that any totality 
composed of an infinite number of 



parts must, itself, be infinite, 
whereas we know that an infinite 
number of elements make up a finite total. Besides — " 

Matthe smiled gently and held 
up i. hand. "Please, sir, don't misunderstand me. I do not deny that 
today we understand Zeno's paradox. But believe me, for long centuries the best minds the human 
race could produce could not explain it." 

The presidor said tactfully, "I 
fail to see your point, Doctr 
Matthe. Please forgive my inadequacy. What possible connection 
has this Dichotomy of Zeno's with 
your projected expedition into the 
past?" 

"I was merely drawing a parallel, 
sir. Zeno conceived the paradox 
proving that it was impossible to 
cover any distance, nor were the 
ancients able to explain it. But did 
that prevent them from covering 
distances? Obviously not. Today, 
my assistants and I have devised a 
method to send our young friend 
here, Jan Obreen, into the distant 
past. The paradox is immediately 
pointed out — suppose he should 
kill an ancestor or otherwise change 
history? I do not claim to be able 
to explain how this apparent paradox is overcome in time travel; all 
I know is that time travel is possible. Undoubtedly, better minds 
than mine will one day resolve the 
paradox, but until then we shall 
continue to utilize time travel, 
paradox or not." 



68 




 



Jan Obreen had been sitting, 
nervously quiet, listening to his distinguished superiors. Now he 
cleared his throat and said, "I believe the hour has arrived for the 
experiment." 

The presidor shrugged his continued disapproval, but dropped the 
conversation. He let his eyes scan 
doubtfully the equipment that 
stood in the corner of the laboratory. 

Matthe shot a quick glance at the 
time piece, then hurried last minute instructions to his student. 

"We've been all over this before, Jan, but to sum it up — You 
should appear approximately in the 
middle of the so-called Twentieth 
Century; exactly where, we don't 
know. The language will be AmerEnglish, which you have studied 
thoroughly; on that count you 
should have little difficulty. You 
will appear in the United States of 
North America, one of the ancient 
nations — as they were called — a political division of whose purpose 
we are not quite sure. One of the 
designs of your expedition will be 
to determine why the human race 
at that time split itself into scores 
of states, rather than having but one 
government. 

"You will have to adapt yourself to the conditions you find, Jan. 
Our histories are so vague that we 
can help you but little in information on what to expect." 

The presidor put in, "I am extremely pessimistic about this, 



Obreen, yet you have volunteered 
and I have no right to interfere. 
Your most important task is to 
leave a message that will come 
down to us; if you are successful, 
other attempts will be made to still 
other periods in history. If you 
fail—" 

"He won't fail," Matthe said. 

The presidor shook his head and 
grasped Obreen 's hand in farewell. 

Jan Obreen stepped to the equipment and mounted the small platform. He clutched the metal grips 
on the instrument panel somewhat 
desperately, hiding to the best of 
his ability the shrinking inside himself. 

rHE sheriff said, "Well, this 
fella — you say he told you he 
came from the future?" 

Lou Allenby nodded. "About 
four thousand years ahead. He said 
it was the year thirty-two hundred 
and something, but that it was 
about four thousand years from 
now; they'd changed the numbering system meanwhile." 

"And you didn't figure it was 
hogwash, boy? From the way you 
talked, I got the idea that you kind 
of believed him." 

The other wet his lips. "I kind 
of believed him," he said doggedly. "There was something about 
him; he was different. I don't mean 
physically, that he couldn't pass for 
being born now, but there was . . . 
something different. Kind of, well, 
like he was at peace with himself; 



DARK INTERLUDE 



gave the impression that where he 
came from everybody was. And he 
was smart, smart as a whip. And 
he wasn't crazy, either." 

"And what was he doing back 
here, boy?" The sheriffs voice was 
gently caustic. 

"He was — some kind of student. 
Seems from what he said that almost everybody in his time was a 
student. They'd solved all the problems of production and distribution, nobody bad to worry about 
security; in fact, they didn't seem 
to worry about any of the things ive 
do now." There was a trace of wistfulness in Lou Allenby's voice. He 
took a deep breath and went on. 
"He'd come back to do research in 
our time. They didn't know much 
about it, it seems. Something had 
happened in between — there was a 
bad period of several hundred years 
— and most books and records had 
been lost. They had a few, but not 
many. So they didn't know much 
about us and they wanted to fill in 
what they didn't know." 

"You believed all that, boy? Did 
he have any proof?" 

* * * 

IT WAS the dangerous point; this 
was where the prime risk lay. 
They had had, for all practical purposes, no knowledge of the exact 
contours of the land, forty centuries 
back, nor knowledge of the presence of trees or buildings. If he 
appeared at the wrong spot, it 
might well mean instant death. 



Jan Obreen was fortunate; he 
didn't hit anything. It was, in fact, 
the other way around. He came out 
ten feet in the air over a -plowed 
field. The fall was nasty enough, 
but the soft earth protected him; 
one ankle seemed sprained, but not 
too badly. He came painfully to his 
feet and looked around. 

The presence of the field alone 
was sufficient to tell him that the 
Matthe process was at least partially successful. He was far before 
his own age. Agriculture was still 
a necessary component of human 
economy, indicating a definitely 
earlier civilization than his own. 

Approximately half a mile away 
was a densely wooded area; not a 
park, nor even a planned forest to 
house - the controlled wild life of 
his time. A haphazardly growing 
wooded area — almost unbelievable. 
But, then, he must grow used to 
the unbelievable; of all the historic periods, this was the least 
known. Much would be strange. 

To his right, a few hundred 
yards away, was a wooden building. 
It was, undoubtedly, a human 
dwelling despite its primitive appearance. There was no use putting 
it off; contact with his fellow man 
would have to be made. He limped 
awkwardly toward his meeting 
with the Twentieth Century. 

The girl had evidently not observed his precipitate arrival, but 
by the time he arrived in the yard 
of the farm house, she had come 
to the door to greet him. 



70 




 



Her dress was of another age, 
for in his era the clothing of the 
feminine portion of the race was 
not designed to lure the male. Hers, 
however, was bright and tasteful 
with color, and it emphasized the 
youthful contours of her body. Nor 
was it her dress alone that startled 
him. There was a touch of color on 
her lips that he suddenly realized 
couldn't have been achieved by nature. He had read that primitive 
women used colors, paints and pigments of various sorts, upon their 
faces — somehow or other, now that 
he witnessed it, he was not repelled. 

She smiled, the red of her mouth 
stressing the even whiteness of her 
teeth. She said, "It would've been 
easier to come down the road 
'stead of across the field." Her eyes 
took him in, and, had he been 
more experienced, he could have 
read interested approval in them. 

He said, studiedly, "I am afraid 
that I am not familiar with your 
agricultural methods. I trust I have 
not irrevocably damaged the products of your horticultural efforts." 

Susan Allenby blinked at him. 
"My," she said softly, a distant hint 
of laughter in her voice, "somebody 
sounds like maybe they swallowed 
a dictionary." Her eyes widened 
suddenly, as she noticed him favoring his left foot. "Why, you've hurt 
yourself. Now you come right on 
into the house and let me see if I 
can't do something about that. 
Why—" 

He followed her quietly, only 



half hearing her words. Something 
— something phenomenal — was 
growing within Jan Obreen, affecting oddly and yet pleasantly his 
metabolism. 

He knew now what Matthe and 
the presidor meant by paradox. 

rHE sheriff said, "Well, you 
were away when he got to your 
pface — however he got there?" 

Lou Allenby nodded. "Yes, that 
ivas ten days ago. I was in Miami 
taking a couple of weeks' vacation. 
Sis and I each get away for a week 
or two every year, but we go at 
different times, partly because we 
figure it's a good idea to get away 
from one another once in a while 
anyway." 

"Sure, good idea, boy. But your 
Sis, she believed this story of where 
he came from?" 

"Yes. And, Sheriff, she had 
proof. I ivisb I'd seen it too. The 
field he landed in was fresh 
plowed. After she'd fixed his ankle 
she was curious enough, after what 
he'd told her, to follow his footsteps through the dirt back to 
where they'd started. And they 
ended, or, rather, started, right 
smack in the middle of a field, with 
a deep mark like he'd fallen there." 

"Maybe he came from an airplane, in a parachute, boy. Did yon 
think of that?" 

"I thought of that, and so did 
Sis. She says that if he did he 
must've swallowed the parachute.

She could follow bis steps every bit 
of the way — // was only a few 
hundred yards — and there wasn't 
any place he could've hidden or 
buried a parachute." 

The sheriff said, "They got married right away, you say?" 

"Two days later. 1 had the car 
with me, so Sis hitched the team 
and drove them into town — he 
didn't know how to drive horses — 
and they got married." 

"See the license, boy? You sure 
they was really — " 

Lou Allenby looked at him, his 
lips beginning to go white, and the 
sheriff said hastily, "All right, boy, 
1 didn't mean it that way. Take it 
easy, boy."

SUSAN had sent her brother a 
telegram telling him all about 
it, but he'd changed hotels and 
somehow the telegram hadn't been 
forwarded. The first he knew of 
the marriage was when he drove 
up to the farm almost a week later. 

He was surprised, naturally, but 
John O'Brien — Susan had altered 
the name somewhat — seemed likable enough. Handsome, too, if a 
bit strange, and he and Susan 
seemed head over heels in love. 

Of course, he didn't have any 
money, they didn't use it in his 
day, he had told them, but he was 
a good worker, not at all soft. 
There was no reason to suppose 
that he wouldn't make out all right. 
The three of them planned, ten


tatively, for Susan and John to stay 
at the farm until John had learned 
the ropes somewhat. Then he expected to be able to find some manner in which to make money — he 
was quite optimistic about his ability in that line — and spending his 
time traveling, taking Susan with 
him. Obviously, he'd be able to 
learn about the present that way. 

The important thing, the allembracing thing, was to plan some 
message to get to Doctr Matthe and 
the presidor. If this type of research was to continue, all depended upon him. 

He explained to Susan and Lou 
that it was a one-way trip. That 
the equipment worked only in one 
direction, that there was travel to 
the past, but not to the future. He 
was a voluntary exile, fated to 
spend the rest of his life in this 
era. The idea was that when he'd 
been in this century long enough 
to describe it well, he'd write up 
his report and put it in a box he'd 
have especially made to last forty 
centuries and bury it where it could 
be dug up — in a spot that had been 
determined in the future. He had 
the exact place geographically. 

He" was quite excited when they 
told him about the time capsules 
that had been buried elsewhere. He 
knew that they had never been dug 
up and planned to make it part of 
his report so the men of the future 
could find them. 

They spent their evenings in long 
conversations, Jan telling of his 



72 




 



age and what he knew of all the 
long centuries in between. Of the 
long fight upward and man's conquests in the fields of science, medicine and in human relations. And 
they telling him of theirs, describing the institutions, the ways of 
life which he found so unique. 

Lou hadn't been particularly 
happy about the precipitate marriage at first, but he found himself 
warming to Jan. Until . . . 

* * * 

rHE sheriff said, "And he didn't 
tell you what he was till this 
evening?" 

"That's right." 

"Your sister heard him say it? 
She'll back you up?" 

"I ... I guess she will. She's 
upset now, like I said, kind of hysterical. Screams that she's going to 
leave me and the farm. But she 
heard him say it, Sheriff. He must 
of had a strong hold on her, or she 
wouldn't be acting the way she is." 

"Not that I douJ>t your word, 
boy, about a thing like that, but 
it'd be better if she heard it too. 
Hoiv'd it come up?" 

"I got to asking him some questions about things in his time and 
after a while 1 asked him how they 
got along on race problems and he 
acted puzzled and then said he remembered something about races 
from history he'd studied, but that 
there weren't any races then. 

"He said that by his time — starting after the war of something-or


other, I forget its name — all the 
races had blended into one. That 
the whites and the yellows had 
mostly killed one another off and 
that Africa had dominated the 
world for a while, and then all the 
races had begun to blend into one 
by colonization and intermarriage 
and that by bis time the process 
was complete. I just stared at him 
and asked him, 'You mean you 
got nigger blood in you?' and he 
said, fust like it didn't mean anything, 'At least one-fourth.' " 

"W ell, boy, you did just what 
you had to do," the sheriff told 
him earnestly, "no doubt about it." 

"I just saw red. He'd married 
Sis; he was sleeping with her. I was 
so crazy-mad I don't even remember getting my gun." 

"W ell, don't worry about it, boy. 
You did right." 

"But I feel like hell about it. 
He didn't know." 

"Now that's a matter of opinion, 
boy. Maybe you stvalloived a little 
too much of this hogwash. Coming 
from the future—huh! These niggers'll think up the damnedest 
tricks to pass themself off as white. 
What kind of proof for his story is 
that mark on the ground? Hogwash, boy. Ain't nobody coming 
from the future or going there 
neither. We can just quiet this up 
so it won't never be heard of nowhere. It'll be like it never happened."

RULE OF THREE 




By THEODORE STURGEON 



Of course you'd be host to guests 
from outer space; it's common 
courtesy. Hut being a host can 
have a peculiarly nasty meaning! 



THEY were a decontamination squad — three energyentities (each triple) — on a 
routine check of a known matterentity culture. What they traveled 
in was undoubtedly a 'ship, since it 
moved through space, except that 
it was not a physical structure of 
metal. It slowed down like a light 
wave that had suddenly grown 
tired. 

"There it is," said RilRylRul. 

The two other triads merged 
their light-perceptions and observed 
it. "Out at the edge," said KadKedKud, in satisfaction. "It should 



not be too difficult to handle out 
there. When infection spreads near 
the heart of a Galaxy, it can be 
troublesome." 

MakMykMok cautioned, "Don't 
underestimate the job until it's surveyed." 

"It's a very small sun," said Ril. 
"Which one of the planets is it? 
The fourth?" 

"No, the greenish-blue one, the 
third." 

"Very well." 

In due time the ship — a bubble 
of binding energy and collapsed, 
rarefied gas molecules — entered the 



RULE OF THREE 



75 



atmosphere. It reshaped itself gradually into a round-nosed, tapered 
transparency and dropped sharply, 
heading due west over the planet's 
equator. 

"Busy little things, aren't they?" 

As the world turned under them, 
they watched. They saw the ships, 
the cities. In the microscopic, intangible fluxes of force which were 
nerve and sinew and psyche to their 
triple structure, they stored their 
observations. They recorded the 
temperature of steel converters and 
ships' power plants, calculated the 
strength of materials of buildings 
and bridges by their flexure in a 
simply computed wind velocity, 
judged and compared the flowshapes of air and ground vehicles. 

"We could return right now," 
said Kad. "Any race which has 
progressed this far in such a brief 
time must be a healthy one. Otherwise how could — " 

"Look!" Ril flashed. 




HEY watched, appalled. "They 



"It must be a ritual," said Kad, 
"or perhaps a hunt. But we'd better 
investigate closer." 

They dropped down, swiftly 
overtook a low-flying open-cockpit 
biplane with a black cross on the 
fuselage, and settled on the cowling behind the pilot's head. Mak 
interpenetrated the ship's wall and, 
treading and passing the air molecules which fled past, reached the 
pilot's leather helmet at the nape 



of the neck. Contact was made and' 
broken almost in the same moment 
of time, and Mak hurtled back in 
horror to the skin of their ship. 

"Get clear!" he ordered. 

In three microseconds the invisible ship was in the upper atmosphere, with Mak still clinging to 
the outer skin. 

"What was it?" 

"Pa'ak, the most vicious, most 
contagious energy-virus known. 
That creature is crawling with 
them! Never have" I seen such an 
infestation ! Examine me. Irradiate 
me. Be careful, now — be sure." 

It was strong medicine, but effective. Mak weakly permeated 
through the ship's wall and came 
inside. "Disgusting. Utterly demoralizing. How can the creature live 
in that condition?" 

"Worse than Murktur III?" 

"Infinitely worse. On Murktur I 
never saw a concentration higher 
than 14, and that was enough to 
reduce the natives to permanent 
bickering. These bipeds can apparently stand a concentration of over 
120 on the same scale. Incredible." 

"Perhaps that individual is quarantined." 

"I doubt it. It was flying its own 
machine; it can apparently land at 
will anywhere. But we will check 
further. Mak, you were quite right," 
said Ril. "Don't underestimate the 
job, indeed. Why, with an infestation like that, and a drive like that 
. . . what couldn't they accomplish 
if they were clean?" 



74 




 



They swooped close to the land, 
barely touched the hair of a child 
on a hilltop, and soared again, 
shaken and frightened. 

"From what we've seen, that one 
was no more than 15% of maximum size. How do you read the 
Pa'ak concentration?" 

"Over 70. This place is a pesthole. These creatures must be 
stopped — and soon. You know how 
soon such a technology reaches for 
the stars." 

"Shall we send for reinforcements?" 

"Before investigating? Certainly 
not. And after all, there are three 
of us." 

"We shall have to protect ourselves," Ril pointed out. 

"You mean — dissociate? Divide 
our triple selves?" 

"You know that's the only way 
we can remain undetected by the 
Pa'ak. Of course, once we know 
exactly how they have developed 
here, and have analyzed the psychic 
components of the natives, we can 
re-synthesize." 

"I hate the thought of dividing 
myself. So weak, so impotent . . ." 

"So safe. Don't forget that. Once 
we've encased ourselves in the 
minds of these creatures and analyzed them, we'll have to join ourselves again to fight the Pa'ak." 

"Yes, indeed. And we'll be together again soon. Take care," 
added Mak, the cautious one. "The 
Pa'ak are mindless, but exceedingly 
dangerous." 



"Hungry," Kad supplemented. 
"Especially for our kind. Shall 

we begin?" 

The ship disappeared, bursting 
like a bubble. The three dropped, 
sharing a wordless thought that was 
like a handclasp. Then each of 
them separated into three, and the 
nine particles drifted down through 
the atmosphere.

A YOUNG girl lay on her stomach under a tree, reading. She 
yawned widely, choked a little, 
swallowed, and went back to her 
book. 

Two friends shook hands. Later, 
one absentmindedly palmed the 
back of his neck. Something was 
rubbed into his skin. The other 
young man scratched his wrist as 
he walked away. 

Something was in the drinking 
water, though neither the nurse, as 
she filled the glass, nor the little 
girl, as she drank, knew of it. 

Some dust settled on a toothbrush. 

A small boy sank his teeth into 
his bread-and-jam. The rich, red 
preserve drooled to the table. The 
boy put his finger in it, thrust the 
finger into his mouth. 

Another youngster ran through 
the dewy morning grass in his bare 
feet.

Somewhere, two dust motes were 
waiting their turn. 

And a number of years went by.

There was a character at the party 
named Irving, and Jonathan Prince, 
Consulting Psychologist, didn't like 
him. This Irving played guitar and 
sang folksongs in a resonant baritone, which was fine; but after that 
he would put a lampshade on his 
head and be the "March of the 
Wooden Soldiers" or some such, 
and that was as funny, after the 
fourth viewing, as a rubber crutch. 
So Jonathan let his eyes wander. 

When his gaze came to the dark 
girl sitting by the door, his breath 
hissed in suddenly. 

Priscilla was sitting next to him. 
She said "Ouch," and he realized 
he had squeezed her hand painfully. 

"What's the matter, Jon?" 

"I just — nothing, Pris." He knew 
it was tactless, because he knew the 
sharpness of Priscilla's tilted eyes, 
but he couldn't help it; he stared 
back at the dark girl. 

The girl's hair was blue-black 
and gleamed like metal, yet he 
knew how soft it would be. Her 
eyes were brown, wide apart, deep. 
He knew how they would crinkle 
on the outside ends when she 



smiled. He knew, as a matter of 
fact, that she had a small brown 
mole on the inside of her left thigh. 

Irving was still singing. Of 
course it had to be "Black Is the 
Color of my True Love's Hair." 
Priscilla pressed Jon's hand, gently. 
He leaned toward her. 

She whispered, "Who's the 
charmer? Someone you know?" 

He hesitated. Then he nodded 
and said, without smiling, "My exwife." 

Priscilla let his hand go. 

JONATHAN waited until Irving 
finished his song and, in the 
applause, rose. " 'Scuse . . ." he 
muttered. Priscilla didn't seem to 
be listening. 

He crossed the room and stood 
in front of the dark girl until she 
looked up at him. He saw the 
little crinkle by her eyes before he 
saw the smile. 
"Edie." 

"Jon! How are you?" Then she 
said, in unison with him, "Can't 
complain." And she laughed at him. 

He flushed, but it was not anger. 
He sat on the ottoman by her feet. 
"How've you been, Edie? You 
haven't changed." 

"I haven't," she nodded seriously. There was an echo in his mind. 
"We'll always be friends, Jon. 
Nothing can change that." Was 
that what she meant? She said, 
"Still trying to find out how the 
human mind works?" 

"Yes, on the occasions when I 



78 




 



find one that does. Are you in town 
for long?" 

"I've come back. They closed the 
Great Falls office. Jon ..." 

"Yes?" 

"Jon, who's the redhead?" 
"Priscilla. Priscilla Berg. My assistant." 

"She's lovely, Jon. Really lovely. 
Is she . . . are you . . ." 

At last he could smile. "You can 
ask, Edie," he said gently. "Here, 
I'll ask .you first. Are you married?" 

"No." 

"I didn't think so. I don't know 
why, but I didn't think so. Neither 
am I." 

He looked down at his hands because he knew she was smiling, and 
somehow he didn't want to look 
into her eyes and smile too. "I'll 
get us a drink." 

She waited until he was on his 
feet and a pace away before she 
said what she used to say: "Come 
back quickly." 

Someone jostled him at the bar. 

"What's up, Doc?" said Irving, 
and nickered. "Hey, that assistant 
of yours, she drinks scotch, doesn't 
she?" 

"Rye on the rocks," he said absently, and then realized that the 
scotch suggestion was Irving's shot 
in the dark, and that he'd given 
the idiot an opening gambit with 
Priscilla. He was mildly annoyed 
as he ordered two Irish-and-waters 

and went back to Edie.

Communication was dim and labored. 

"We're trapped ..." 

"Don't give up. Ked is very close 
to me now." 

"Yes, you and Ked can achieve 
proximity. But these creatures won't 
combine emotionally in threes!" 

"They can — they must!" 

"Do not force them. Remain encysted and work carefully. Did you 
know the Pa'ak got Mak?" 

"No! How horrible! What about 
Myk and Mok, then?" 

"They will be guardians, watchers, communicators. What else can 
they do?" 

"Nothing . . . nothing. How terrible to be one-third dead! What 
happened to Mak?" 

"The creature Mak occupied 
killed itself, walked in front of a 
speeding vehicle as Mak tried to 
synthesize. Mak could not get clear 
in time from the dead thing." 

"We must hurry or these beasts 
will leap off into space before we 
join our strength again."

THE club wouldn't be open for 
hours yet, but Derek knew 
which of the long row of herculite 
doors would be unlocked. He shouldered it open and sidled in, being 
careful not to let it swing shut on 
his bass viol. 

Someone was playing the piano 
out back. Piano . . . hadn't Janie

away? He mumbled, "Hope 
she — " and then Jane was on, over, 
and all around him. 

"Derek, you tall, short underdone yuk, you!" she crooned. She 
hugged him, and put a scarlet print 
of her full mouth on his cheek. 
"Why didn't you wire? God, man, 
I missed you. Here, put down that 
Steinway and smooch me once. Am 
I glad to see your ugly head . . . 
Look at the man," she demanded 
of. the empty club as he leaned the 
big bass against the wall and stroked its rounded flank with the tips 
of his fingers. "Hey, this is me 
over here." 

"How are you, Janie?" He delivered a hug. "What's been giving 
around here?" 

"Me," she said. "Giving, but 
out. Ma-an ... a hassel. For ten 
days I had a sore throat clear from 
neck to tonsil, carrying that piano 
man. Damn it, I got a way I sing, 
and a piano's got to walk around 
me when I do it. Chopsticks this 
square makes — eggs — ack — ly — on 
the — beat," she stressed flatly. "And 
then a bass player I had, a doghouse complete with dog, and tonedeaf to boot. I booted him. I worked the last three nights without a 
bass, and am I glad you're back!" 

"Me too." He touched her hair. 
"We'll get you a piano player and 
cverything'll riff like Miff." 

"A piano I got," she said, and 
her voice was awed. "Little cat I 
heard in a joint after hours. Gives 
his left hand a push and forgets 



about it. Right hand is crazy. Real 
sad little character, Derek. Gets the 
by-himself blues and plays boogie 
about it. Worse he feels, the better 
he plays. Sing with him? Man! All 
his chords are vocal cords for little 
Janie. He's back there now. Listen 
at him!" 

DEREK listened. The piano back 
there was talking to itself 
about something rich and beautiful 
and lost. "That just one man?" he 
asked after a moment. 

"Come on back and meet him," 
she said. "Oh, Derek, he's a sweetheart." 

"Sweetheart?" 

She thumped his chest and 
chuckled. "Wait till you see him. 
You don't need to lie awake nights 
over him. Come on." 

He was a man with a hawk face 
and peaceful eyes. He huddled on 
the bench watching what his hands 
did on the keyboard as if he hadn't 
seen them before but didn't much 
care. His hands were extraordinarily eloquent. He didn't look up. 

Derek said, "I'm going to go get 
my fiddle." 

He did, and picked up the beat 
so quietly that the pianist didn't 
hear him for three bars. Then he 
looked up and smiled shyly at 
Derek and went on playing. It was 
very, very good. They volleyed an 
intro back and forth for a while 
arid then, before Derek fully realized what they were playing, Janie 
was singing "Thunder and Roses":

"When you gave me your heart 
You gave me the world . . ." 

And, after, there was a chord 
with a tremendous emphasis on an 
added sixth, and then it was augmented — a hungry, hungry leading 
tone, which led, with a shocked 
sort of satisfaction, into silence. 

Derek put by his bass, carefully, 
so it wouldn't make any sound. 

Jane said, in a mouselike voice, 
"I can breathe now?" 

The pianist got up. He was not 
tall. He said, "You're Derek Jax. 
Thanks for letting me play along 
with you. I always wanted to." 

"Thanks, he says." Derek gestured. "You play a whole mess of 
piano. What's your name?" 

"Henry. Henry Faulkner." 

"I never heard of you." 

"He was head of the Orchestration Department at the Institute for 
twelve years," said Jane. 

"Hey? That's all right," said 
Derek. "Symphony stuff. What'd 
you leave for?" 

"Squares," said Henry. To 
Derek, it was a complete explanation. "I'd like to work here." 

Jane closed her eyes and clasped 
her hands. "Yummy." 

Derek said, from a granite face, 
"No." 

JANE stood frozen. Henry came 
out from behind the piano. 
He walked — he all but trotted up 
to Derek. "No? Oh, please! A — 
joke?" 



"No joke. Just no." 

Jane breathed, "Derek, what are 
you on? Goof balls?" 

Derek threw up his hands. "No. 
It's a good word. Ain't 'no' better 
than a whole lot of yak? No, that's 
all." 

"Derek — " 

"Mr. Jax," said Derek. 

"Mr. Jax, please think it over," 
Henry said. "I've Ibeen wanting to 
work with you ever since you recorded 'Slide Down.' You know 
how long ago that was. I don't just 
want to play piano someplace. I 
want to play here — with you. I 
don't care about the pay. Just let 
me back up that bass." 

"He never talked like that to 
me," said Jane with a small smile. 
"You've made yourself a conquest, 
puddinhead. Now — " 

"I don't want to hear that kind 
of talk," exploded Derek. "I don't 
want to hear any kind of talk. I 
said no!" 

Jane came to him. She squeezed 
Henry's forearm and gave him a 
long look. "Walk around some," 
she said kindly. "Come back and 
see me later." 

Derek stood looking at the piano. 
Jane watched Henry go. He walked 
slowly, holding himself in, his head 
forward. At the other side of the 
dance floor he turned and opened 
his mouth to speak, but Jane 
waved him on. He went out. 

Jane whirled on Derek. "Now 
what the God — " 

Derek interrupted her, rasping,

iAllas Mccormick was 

fifty-three years old and knew 



what she was about. She strode 
briskly down Eleventh Street, a 
swift, narrow figure with pointed 
shoulders and sharp wattles at the 
turn of her thin jaw. It was late 
and the tea room would be closed 
before long. 

Verna was there before her, her 
bright white hair and bright blue 
eyes standing out like beacons in 
the softly lit room. 

"Good evening, Pallas." Verna's 
voice was soft and pillowy, like her 
pudgy face and figure. 

"Evening," said Pallas. Without 
preliminaries she demanded, "How 
are yours?" 

Verna sighed. "Not so well. 
Two are willing, one isn't. The 
little fool." 

"They're all fools," said Pallas. 
"Two billion stupid fools. Never 
heard of such a place." 

"They want to do everything by 
twos," said Verna. "They're all 
afraid they'll lose something if they 
don't pair off, pair off. They've 
been schooled and pushed and ordered and taught that that's the way 
it must be, so — " she sighed 
again — "that's the way it is." 

"We haven't much more time. I 
wish we hadn't lost — " There followed a dim attempt to project 
"Mak," a mental designation for

which there was no audible equivalent. 

"Oh, dear, stop saying that! 
You're always saying that. Our first 
third is gone, all eaten up, and 
that's the way it is." 

"TTTE'RE two," said Pallas causVV tically, "and we don't want 
to be. Are you all right?" 

"Thoroughly encysted, thank 
you. Pa'ak can't get to me. I'm so 
well encased I can barely get 
through to control this — " she lifted her arms and dropped them 
heavily on the table — "this bag of 
bones. And I can't telepath. I wish 
I could communicate with you and 
the others directly, instead of 
through this primitive creature and 
its endless idioms. I've even got to 
use that clumsy terrestrial name of 
yours — there's no vocalization for 
our real ones." Again there was an 
effort to identify the speaker as 
"Myk" and the other as "Mok," 
which failed. 

"/ wish I could get through to 
the others. Goodness! A weak signal once in a while — a mere 'come 
close' or 'go away' — and in between, nothing, for weeks on end." 

"Oh, but they've got to stay 
closed up so tight! You know how 
the Pa'ak infection works — increasing the neurotic potential so that 
the virus can feed on the released 
nervous energy. There are two 
groups of three people who must 
come together by their own free 
emotional merging, or Ril's three 



parts and Kad's three parts can 
never become one again. To allow 
them that emotional freedom is to 
allow the Pa'ak virus which infests 
them to remain active, since they 
tend to be attracted to one another 
for neurotic reasons. At least we 
don't have that much trouble. There 
was so little neurosis or anything 
else left in these minds when we 
took them over that they were poor 
feeding grounds for Pa'ak. And 
that's the — " 

"Verna, can you spare me that 
everlasting — " 

" — the way it is," finished Verna 
inexorably. "I'm sorry, Pallas, 
truly. There's a horrid little pushbutton in this mind that plays that 
phrase off every once in a while no 
matter what I do. I'm rebuilding 
the mind as fast as I can; I'll get to 
it soon. I hope." 

"Verna . . ." said Pallas with an 
air of revelation. "We can speed 
this thing up. I'm sure we can. 
Look. These fools won't group in 
threes. And Ril and Kad can't complete themselves unless their three 
hosts are emotionally ready for it. 
Now then." She leaned forward 
over her teacup. "There's no important difference between two 
groups of three and three groups 
of two." 

"You really think . . . why, 
Pallas, that's a marvelous idea. 
You're so clever, dear! Now, the 
first thing we'll have to — " 

They both froze in an attitude 
of listening.

"My word," said Verna. "That's 
a bad one." 

"I'll go," said Pallas. "That's one 
of the creatures I'm guarding. Ril is 
in it." 

"Shall I come too?" 

"You stay here. I'll take a taxi 
and keep in touch with you. When 
I'm far enough away I'll triangulate. Keep watch for that signal 
again. Goodness! What an urgent 
one!" 

She trotted out. Verna looked 
across at Pallas' untouched teacup. 
"She left me with the check." A 
sigh. "Well, that's the way it is."

DR. JONATHAN PRINCE was 
saying, "The world's never 
been in such a state. Industrialization is something you can graph, 
and you find a geometric increase. 
You can graph the incidence of 
psychoneufoses the same way and 
find almost the same curve, but it's 
a much larger one. I tell you, Edie, 
it's as if something were cultivating our little traumas and anxieties 
like plowed fields to increase their 
yield, and then feeding off them." 

"But so much is being done, 
Jon!" his ex-wife protested. 

Jon waved his empty glass. 
"There are 39,000 psychotherapists 



to how many millions of people 
who need their help? There's a 
crying need for some kind of 
simple, standardized therapy, and 
people refuse to behave either simply or according to standards. Somewhere, somehow, there's a new 
direction in therapy. So-called 
orthodox procedures as they now 
exist don't show enough promise. 
They take too long. If by some 
miracle of state support and streamlined education you could create 
therapists for everyone who needed 
them, you'd have what amounted to 
a nation or a world of full-time 
therapists. Someone's got to bake 
bread and drive buses, you know." 

"What about these new therapies I've been reading about?" Edie 
wanted to know. 

"Oh, they're a healthy sign to a 
certain extent; they indicate we 
know how sick we are. The most 
encouraging thing about them is 
their diversity. There are tools and 
schools and phoneys and fads. 
There's psychoanalysis, where the 
patient talks about his troubles to 
the therapist, and narcosyn thesis, 
where the patient's troubles talk to 
the therapist, and hypnotherapy, 
where the therapist talks to the 
patient's troubles. 

"There's insulin to jolt a man 
out of his traumas and electric 
shock to subconsciously frighten 
him out of them, and CO, to choke 
the traumas to death. And there's 
the pre-frontal lobotomy, the transorbital leukotomy, and the topec

tomy to cut the cables between a 
patient's expression of his aberrations and its power supply, with the 
bland idea that the generator will 
go away if you can't see it any more. 
And there's Reichianism which, 
roughly speaking, identifies Aunt 
Susan, who slapped you, with an 
aching kneecap which, when cured, 
cures you of Aunt Susan too. 

"And there's — but why go on ? 
The point is that the mushrooming 
schools of therapy show that we 
know we're sick; that we're anxious 
— but not yet anxious enough, en 
masse — to do something about it, 
and that we're willing to attack the 
problem on all salients and sectors." 

"What kind of work have you 
been doing recently?" Edie asked. 

"Electro-encephalographics, mostly. The size and shape of brainwave graphs will show a great deal 
once we get enough of them. And 
— did you know there's a measurable change in volume of the fingertips that follows brain-wave incidence very closely in disturbed 
cases? Fascinating stuff. But sometimes I feel it's the merest dull 
nudging at the real problems involved. Sometimes I feel like a 
hard-working contour cartographer 
trying to record the height and 
grade of ocean waves. Every time 
you duplicate an observation to 
check it, there's a valley where there 
was a mountain a second ago. 

"And sometimes I feel that if 
we could just turn and look in the 



right direction, we'd see what's doing it to us, plain as day. Here we 
sit with our psychological bottle of 
arnica and our therapeutic cold 
compresses, trying to cure up an 
attack of lumps on the head bone. 
And if we could only turn and 
look in the right place, there would 
be an invisible maniac with a stick, 
beating us over the head, whom 
we'd never detected before." 

"You sound depressed." 

"Oh, I'm not, really," he said. 
He stood up and stretched. "But I 
almost wish I'd get away from that 
recurrent thought of looking in a 
new direction; of correlating neurosis with a virus disorder. Find the 
virus and cure the disease. It's 
panacea; wishful thinking. I'm 
probably getting lazy." 

"Not you, Jon." His ex-wife 
smiled at him. "Perhaps you have 
the answer, subconsciously, but 
what you've learned won't let it 
come out." 

"T 7ERY astute. What made you 
V say that?" 

"It's a thing you used to say all 
the time." 

He laughed and helped her up. 
"Edie, .do you have to get up early 
tomorrow?" 

"I'm unemployed. Didn't I tell 
you?" 

"I didn't ask," he said ruefully. 
"My God, I talk a lot. Would you 
like to see my new lab?" 

"I'd love to! Oh, I'd love it. 
Will it be— all right?" 



86 




 



"All right? Of course it — oh. I 
see what you mean. Priscilla. Where 
is she, anyway?" 

"She went out. I thought you 
noticed. With that man who plays 
the guitar. Irving." She nodded toward the discarded instrument. 

"I hadn't noticed," he said. Over 
his features slipped the poker expression of the consulting psychologist. "Who did you come with?" 

"The same one. Irving. Jon, I 
hope Priscilla can take care of herself." 

"Let's go," he said. 

* * * 

Faintly, and with exasperation, 
Ril's thought came stumblingly 
through to Ryl and Rul: 

"How can a thinking being be 
so stupid? Have you ever heard a 
more accurate description of the 
Pa'ak virus than that? 'Cultivating 
our little traumas and anxieties like 
plowed fields to increase their yield, 
and then feeding off them.' And 
'a new direction.' Why haven't 
these people at least extrapolated 
the idea of energy life? They know 
that matter and energy are the same. 
An energy virus is such a logical 
thing for them to think of !" 

And Rul's response: "They can 
no more isolate their experiments 
from their neuroses than they can 
isolate their measuring instruments 
from gravity. Have patience. When 
we are able to unite again, we will 
have the strength to inform them." 
Ril sent: "Patience? How much 



more time do you think we have 
before they start to spread the virus 
through this whole sector of the 
cosmos? They are improving rockets, aren't they? We should have 
sent for reinforcements. But then 
— how could we know we'd be 
trapped like this in separate entities which refuse to merge?" 

"We couldn't," Ril answered. 
"We still have so much to learn 
about these creatures. Sending for 
reinforcements would solve nothing." 

"And we have so little time," Rul 
mourned. "Once they leave Earth, 
the Pa'ak pestilence will no longer 
be isolated." 

Ril responded: "Unless they are 
cured of the disease before they 
leave." 

"Or prevented from leaving," 
Ryl pointed out. "An atomic war 
would lower the level of culture. If 
there is no choice, we could force 
them to fight — we have the power 
— and thus reduce their technology 
to the point where space flight 
would be impossible." 

It was a frightening idea. They 
broke contact in trembling silence. 

* ♦ * 

THEY had had a drink, and then 
coffee, and- now Irving was 
leading her homeward. She hadn't 
wanted to go through the park, but 
it was late and he assured her that 
it was much shorter this way. 
"There are plenty of places through 
here where you can cut corners." It 



RULE OF THREE 



87 



was easier not ' to argue. Irving 
commanded a flood of language at 
low pitch and high intensity that 
she could do without just now. She 
was tired and bored and extremely 
angry. 

It was bad enough that Jon had 
deserted her for that bit of flotsam 
from his past. It was worse that she 
should have walked right past him 
with her hat on without his even 
looking up. What was worst of all 
was that she had let herself be so 
angry. She had no claims on Jonathan Prince. They were more than 
friends, certainly, but not any more 
than that. 

"Who's the girl you came to the 
party with, Irving?" she asked. 

"Oh, her. Someone trying to get 
a job at the plant. She's a real 
bright girl. Electronics engineer — 
can you imagine?" 

"And—" 

HE GLANCED down at her. 
"And what? I found out she 
was a cold fish, that's all." 

Oh, she thought. So you ditched 
her because you thought she was a 
cold fish, and scooped me up. And 
what does that make me? Aloud 
she said, "These paths wind 
around the park so. Are you sure 
it's going to take us out on the 
downtown side?" 

"I know everything about these 
woods." He peered. "This way." 

They turned off the blacktop 
walk and took a graveled path away 
to the right. The path was brilliant


ly lit by a street-lamp at the crossing of the walks, and the light 
followed the path in a straight 
band through the undergrowth. It 
seemed so safe . . . and then Irving 
turned off to still another path. She 
turned with him, unthinking, and 
blinked her eyes against a sudden, 
oppressive darkness. 

It was a small cul de sac, completely surrounded by heavy undergrowth. As her eyes became accustomed to the dim light that filtered 
through the trees, she saw benches 
and two picnic tables. A wonderful, 
secluded, restful little spot, she 
thought — for a picnic. 

"How do you like this?" whispered Irving hoarsely. He sounded 
as if he had been running. 

"I don't," she said immediately. 
"It's late, Irving. This isn't getting 
either of us anywhere." 

"Oh, I don't know," he said. He 
put his arms around her. She 
leaned away from him with her 
head averted, swung her handbag 
back and up at his face. He caught 
her wrist deftly and turned it behind her. 

"Don't," she gasped. "Don't . . •." 

"You've made your little protest 
like a real lady, honey, so it's on 
the record. Now save us some time 
and trouble. Let's get to it." 

She kicked him. He gasped but 
stood solidly. There was a sharp 
click behind her. "Hear that?" he 
said. "That's my switch-blade. 
Push a button and zip! — seven 
inches of nice sharp steel. Now

don't you move or make a sound, 
sweetheart, and this'll be fun for 
both of us." 

Locking her against him with his 
left arm, he reached slowly up under the hem of her short jacket. 
She felt the knife against her back. 
It slipped coldly between her skin 
and the back of her low-cut dress. 
"Don't you move," he said again. 
The knife turned, sawed a little, 
and the back strap of her brassiere 
parted. The knife was removed; she 
heard it click again. He dropped it 
into his jacket pocket. 

"Now," he breathed, "doesn't 
that feel better, lamb-pie?" 

SHE filled her lungs to scream, 
and instantly his hard hand 
was clamped over her mouth. It 
was a big hand, and the palm was 
artfully placed so that she couldn't 
get her mouth open wide enough 
to use her teeth on it. 

"Let's not wrestle," he said, his 
voice really gentle, pleading. "It 
just doesn't make sense. I'd as soon 
kill you as not — you know that." 

She stood trembling violently, 
her eyes rolled up almost out of 
sight. Her mouth sagged open when 
he kissed it. Then he screamed. 

His arms whipped away from 
her and she fell. She lay looking 
dully up at him. He stood straight 
in the dim light, stretched, his face 
up and twisted with pain. He had 
both hands, apparently, on one of 
his back pockets. He whirled around 
and her eyes followed him. 



There was someone else standing 
there . . . someone in black. Someone who looked like a high-school 
teacher Priscilla had once had. Gray 
hair, thin, wattled face. 

Moving without haste but with 
great purpose, the spinsterish apparition stooped, raised her skirts 
daintily and kicked Irving accurately in the groin. He emitted a croaking sound and dropped to a crouch, 
and began a small series of agonized grunts. The old lady stepped 
forward as if she were dancing a 
minuet, put out one sensible shoe 
and shoved. Irving went down on 
his knees and elbows, his head 
hanging. 

"Get out," said the old lady crisply. "Now." She clapped her hands 
once. The sound stiffened Irving. 
With a long, breathy groan he staggered to his feet, turned stupidly 
to get his bearings and hobbled 
rapidly away. 

"Come on, dear." The woman 
got her hands under Priscilla's armpits and helped her up. She halfcarried the girl over to one of the 
picnic tables and seated her on the 
bench. With an arm around Priscilla's shoulders, she held her upright while she put a large black 
handbag on the table. Out of it she 
rummaged a voluminous handkerchief which she thrust into Priscilla's hands. "Now, you sit there 
and cry a while." 

Priscilla said, still trembling, "I 
can't," and burst into tears. 

When it was over she blew her

nose weakly. "I don't . . . know 
what to say to you. I — he would 
have killed me." 

"No, he wouldn't. Not while I'm 
alive and carry a hatpin." 

"Who are you?" 

"A friend. If you'll believe that, 
child, that's good enough for me 
and it'll have to be good enough 
for you." 

"I believe that," said Priscilla. 
She drew a long, shuddering breath. 
"How can I ever thank you?" 

"By paying attention to what I 
tell you. But you must tell me some 
things first. How did you ever get 
yourself mixed up with such an 
animal? You surely have better 
sense than that." 

"T) LEASE don't scold ... I was 

-L silly, that's all." 

"You were in a tizzy, you mean. 
You were, weren't you?" 

"Well," sniffed Priscilla, "yes. 
You see, I work with this doctor, 
and he and I — it isn't anything formal, you understand, but we work 
so well together and laugh at the 
same things, and it's . . . nice. And 
then he — " 

"Go on." 

"He was married once. Years 
ago. And he saw her tonight. And 
he didn't look at me any more. I 
guess I'm foolish, but I got all upset." 

"Why?" 

"I told you. He just wanted to 
talk to her. He forgot I was alive." 
"That isn't why. You were upset 



because you were afraid he'd get 
together with her again." 

"I — I suppose so." 

"Do you want to marry him?" 

"Why, I— I don't .... No, I 
wouldn't. It isn't that." 

The old lady nodded. "You 
think if he married her again — or 
anyone else — that it would make a 
big difference in the work you do 
together, in the way he treats you?" 

"I . . . don't suppose there would 
be any big difference, no," Priscilla 
said thoughtfully. "I'd never 
thought it through." 

"And," continued the old lady 
relentlessly, "have you thought 
through any other possible course 
of action he could have taken tonight? He was married to her for 
some time. He apparently hasn't 
seen her for years. It must have 
been a small shock to him to find 
her there. Now, what else might 
he have done? 'Goodness gracious, 
there's my old used-up wife. Priscilla, let's dance.' Is that what you 
expected?" 

At last she giggled. "You're 
wonderful. And you're right, you 
are so absolutely right. I have been 
sil— Oh!" 

"What is it?" 

"You called me Priscilla. How 
did you know my name? Who are 
you?" 

"A friend. Come along, girl; 
you can't sit here all night." She 
drew the startled girl to her feet. 
"Here, let me look at you. Your 
lipstick's smeared. Over here.

That's better. Can you button that 
jacket? I think perhaps you should. 
Not that it should matter if your 
bust does show, the way you brazen 
things dress nowadays. There now, 
come along." 

She hurried Priscilla through the 
park, and when they reached the 
street, turned north. Priscilla 
tugged at the black sleeve. "Please 
— wait. I live that way." She 
pointed. 

"I know, I know. But you're not 
going home just yet. Come along, 
child!" 

"Where are you — we — going?" 

"You'll see. Now listen to me. 
Do you trust me?" 

"Oh, my goodness, yes !" 

"Very well. When we get where 
we're going, you'll go inside alone. 
Don't worry now, it's perfectly safe. 
Once you're inside you'll do something very stupid indeed." 

"I will?" 

"You will. You'll turn around 
and try to leave. Now, then, I want 
you to understand that you must 
not leave. I shall be standing outside to see that you don't." 

"But I— £ut why? What am I 
supposed . . . where ..." 

"Hush, child ! You do as you're 
told and you'll be all right." 

Priscilla walked along in silence 
for a time. Then she said, "All 
right." The old lady turned to look 
into the softest-smiling, most trusting face she had ever seen. She put 
her arm around Priscilla's shoulders and squeezed. 



"You'll do," she said. 

HENRY FAULKNER sat in a 
booth, far from the bellythumping juke box and the knot of 
people chattering away at the headend of the bar. Henry's elbows were 
on the table and his thumbs, fitted 
carefully into the bony arches over 
his eyelids, supported the weight 
of his head. The cafe went round 
and round like a Czerny etude, but 
with a horizontal axis. The walls 
moved upward in front of him and 
down behind him, and he felt very 
ill. Once he had forced down three 
beers, and that was his established 
capacity; it had bloated him horribly and he'd had a backache in 
the morning. Tonight he'd had four 
double ryes. 

"There he shtood," he said to 
one of the blonde girls who sat 
opposite, "nex' to the conductor, 
watching the orch'stra, an' sometimes he'd beat time wiz arms. 
When the last movement ended, th' 
audience rozhe up as one man an' 
roared. An' there he shtood, nex' 
to the conductor — " 

"You said that before," said the 
girls. They spoke in unison, and 
the pair of them had only one 
voice, like the doubled leading tone 
in a major chord. 

"There he shtood," Henry went 
on, "shtill beating time after the 
music stopped. An' the conductor, 
wi' eyes in his tears — wi' tears in 
his eyes — turned him around so he 
could shee the applause."

"What was the matter with 
him?" asked the girls. 
"He was deaf." 
"Who was?" 

"Beethoven." Henry wept. 

"My God. Is that what you're 
tying one on about?" 

"You said to tell you the sad 
story," said Henry. "You didn't say 
tell you my sad story." 

"Okay, okay. You got money, 
ain't you?" 

Henry lifted his head and reared 
back to get perspective. It was then 
that the girl merged and became 
one; he realized that there had been 
one all along, in spite of what he 
had seen. That explained why they 
both had the same voice. He was 
extravagantly pleased. "Sure I got 
money." 

"Well, come on up to my place. 
I'm tired uh sittin' around here." 

"Very gracious," he intoned. "I 
shall now tell you the sad story of 
my laysted wife." 

"What type wife?" 

"I beg your pardon? I've never 
been married." 

The girl looked perplexed. 
"Start over again." 

"Da capo," he said with his finger beside his nose. "Very well. I 
repeat. I shall now tell you the 
story of my wasted life." 

"Oh," said the girl. 

"I have had the ultimate in rejections," said Henry solemnly. "I 
fell in love, deeply, deeply, deeply, 
dee — " 

"Who with?" said the girl tired


ly. "Get to the point and let's get 
out of here." 

"With a string bass. A bull, as 
it were, fiddle." He nodded solemnly. 

"Ah, fer Pete's sake," she said 
scornfully. She stood up. "Look, 
mister, I can't waste the whole 
night. Are you comin' or ain't 
you?" 

HENRY scowled up at her. He 
hadn't asked for her company. She'd just appeared there in 
the booth. She had niggled and 
nagged until he was about to tell 
her all the things he had come here 
to forget. And now she wanted to 
walk out. Suddenly he was furious. 
He, who had never raised his hand 
or his voice in his whole life, was 
suddenly so angry that he was, for 
a moment, blind. He growled like 
the open D on a bass clarinet and 
leaped at her. His clawed hand 
swept past her fluffy collar and got 
caught, tore the collar a little, high 
on the shoulder. 

She squealed in routine fear. The 
bartender hopped up sitting on the 
bar and swung his thick legs over. 

"What the hell's going on back 
there?" he demanded, pushing 
himself off onto the floor. 

The blonde said, shrilly and indignantly, exactly what she thought 
Henry was trying to do. 

"Right there in the booth?" said 
a bourbon up the row. 

"That I got to see," replied a 
beer. 



92 




 



They started back, followed by 
the rest of the customers. 

The bartender reached into the 
booth and lifted Henry bodily out 
of it. Henry, sick and in a state of 
extreme panic, wriggled free and 
ran — two steps. The side of his 
head met the bridge of the bourbon's nose. Henry was aware of a 
dull crunch. There were exploding 
lights and he went down, rolled, 
got to his feet again. 

The girl was screaming in a 
scratchy monotone somewhere 
around high E flat. The bourbon 
was sitting on the floor with blood 
spouting from his nose. 

"Get 'im!" somebody barked. 

Powerful hands caught Henry's 
thin biceps. A heavy man stood in 
front of him, gigantic yellow mallets of fists raised. 

"Hold him tight," said the heavy 
man. "I'm gonna let him have it." 

And then a sort of puffball with 
bright blue eyes was between Henry 
and the heavy man. In a soft, 
severe voice it said, "Leave him 
alone, you — you bullies! You let 
that man go, this very minute!" 

Henry shook his head. He regretted the movement, but among 
the other things it made him experience was clearing sight. He 
looked at the puffball, which became a sweet-faced lady in her 
fifties. She had gentleness about 
her mouth and sheer determination 
in her crackling blue eyes. 

"You better stay out of this, 
Granny," said the bartender not un


kindly. "This character's got it 
comin' to him." 

"You'll let him go this instant!" 
said the lady, and stamped a small 
foot. "And that's the way it is." 

"Al," said the heavy man to the 
bartender, "just lead this lady off 
to one side while I paste this bastard." 

"Don't you put a hand on me." 

"Watch your language, Sylvan," 
said the bartender to the heavy 
man. He put a hand on the lady's 
shoulder. "Come over her a sec — 
uh!" 

THE final syllable was his staccato response to the old lady's 
elbow in the pit of his stomach. 
That, however, was not the end of 
her — literally — chain reaction. She 
swung her crocus reticule around in 
a full-armed arc and brought it 
down on the heavy man's head. He 
sank to the floor without a whimper. In the same movement she put 
her other hand swiftly but firmly 
against Henry's jaw and pushed it 
violently. His head tipped back and 
smashed into the face of the man 
who stood behind him holding his 
arms. The man staggered backward, tripped, and fell, bouncing 
his skull off an unpadded bar stool. 

"Come along, Henry," said the 
old lady cheerfully. She took him 
by the wrist as if he were a small 
boy whose face needed washing, 
and marched him out of the cafe. 

On the street he gasped, "They'll 
chase us . . ." 



RULE OF THREE 



93 



"Naturally," said the lady. She 
put two fingers into her mouth and 
blew a piercing blast. A block and 
a half away, a parked taxicab slid 
away from the curb and came toward them. There was shouting 
from the cafe. The taxicab pulled 
up beside them. The lady whipped 
the door open and pushed Henry 
in. As four angry men shouldered 
out on the sidewalk, she reached 
deep into her reticule and snatched 
a dark object from it. She stood 
poised for a moment, and in the 
neon-shot half-light Henry saw 
what was in her hand — an oldfashioned, top-of-stove flat iron. 
He understood then why the heavy 
man had drowsed off so readily. 

The lady hefted the iron and let 
it fly. It grazed the temple of one 
of the men and flew straight 
through a plate glass window. The 
man who was hit went to his knees, 
his hands holding his head. The 
other three fell all over each other 
trying to get back out of range. 
The lady skipped into the cab and 
said calmly, "Young man, take us 
away from here." 

"Yes, ma'am!" said the driver in 
an awed tone, and let in his clutch. 

They jounced along in silence 
for a moment, and then she leaned 
' forward. "Driver, pull up by one 
of these warehouses. Henry's going 
to be sick." 

"I'm all right," said Henry 
weakly. The cab stopped. The lady 
• opened the door. "Come along!" 

"No, really, I—" 



94 



The lady snapped her fingers. 

"Oh, all right," said Henry 
sheepishly. In the black shadows by 
the warehouse he protested faintly, 
"But I don't want to foe sick!" 

"I know what's best," she said 
solicitously. She took his hand, 
spread it, and presented him with 
his long middle finger, point first, 
as if it were a' clinical thermometer. 
"Down your throat," she ordered. 

"No!" he said loudly. 

"Are you going to do as you're 
told?" 

He looked at her. "Yes." 

"I'll hold your head," she said. 
"Go on." 

She held his head. 

Afterward, in the cab, he asked 
her timidly if she would take him 
home now. 

"No," she said. "You play the 
piano, don't you, Henry?" 

He nodded. 

"Well, you're going to play for 
me." She reached forcefully into 
her reticule again, and his protest 
died on his trembling lips. "Here," 
she said, and handed him an oldfashioned mint. 



JT She had a "walking-underwater" feeling, as if she were 
immersed in her own reluctance. 
She had trod these stairs many 
times at night — usually downward 
after a perplexing, intriguing series 
of experiments. She did not know 
why she should be returning to the 
laboratory now, except that she had 




mounted the stairs.

been ordered to do so. She freely 
admitted that if it were not for the 
thin, straight figure in black who 
waited downstairs, she would certainly be in bed by now. But there 
was an air of command, of complete certainty about the old lady 
who had saved her that was utterly 
compelling. 

She walked quietly down the carpeted hall. The outer door of the 
lab office was ajar. There was no 
light in the office, but a dim radiance filtered in from the lab itself, 
through the frosted panel of the 
inner door. She crossed to it and 
went in. 

Someone gasped. 

Someone said, "Priscilla!" 

Priscilla said, "Excuse me!" and 
spun around. She shot through the 
office and out into the hall, her 
cheeks burning, her eyes stinging. 
"He — he — " she sobbed, but could 
not complete the thought, would 
not review the picture she had seen. 

At the lower landing she raced 
to the street door, valiantly holding 
back the tears and the sobs that 
would accompany them. Her hand 
went out to the 'big brass doorknob, 
touched it — 

' As the cool metal greeted her 
hand she stopped. 

Outside that door, standing on 
the walk by the iron railings, radiating strength and rectitude, would 
be the old lady. She would watch 
Priscilla come out of the building. 
She would probably nod her head 
in knowledgable disappointment. 



She would doubtless say, "I told 
you you would want to leave, and 
that it would be foolish." 

"But they were — " said Priscilla 
in audible protest. 

Then came the thought of trustfulness: "Listen to me. Do you 
trust me?" 

PRISCILLA took her hand away 
from the knob. She thought 
she heard the murmur of low 
voices upstairs. 

She remembered the talk about 
Jon and his meeting with Edie at 
the party. She remembered herself 
saying, "I — just didn't think it 
through." 

She turned and faced the stairs. 
"I can't, I can't possibly go back. 
Not now. Even if . . . even if it 
didn't make any difference to me, 
they'd . . . they'd hate me. It would 
be a terrible thing to do, to go 
back." 

She turned until the big brass 
knob nudged her hip. Its touch 
projected a vivid picture into her 
mind — the old lady, straight and 
waiting in the lamplight. 

She sighed and started slowly up 
the stairs again. 

When she got to the office this 
time the light was on. She pushed 
the door open. Jon was leaning 
against the desk, watching it open. 
Edie, his ex-wife, stood by the laboratory door, her wide-spaced eyes 
soft and bright. For a moment no 
one moved. Then Edie went to Jon 
and stood beside him, and together

they watched Priscilla with questions on their faces, and something 
like gentle sympathy. Or was it 
empathy ? 

Priscilla came in slowly. She 
went up to Edie and stopped. She 
said, "You're just what he 
needed." 

The wide dark eyes filled with 
tears. Edie put her arms out and 
Priscilla was in them without quite 
knowing which of them had moved. 
When she could, Edie said, "You 
are so lovely, Priscilla. You're so 
very lovely." And Priscilla knew 
she was not talking about her red 
hair or her face. 

Jon put a hand on each of their 
shoulders. "I don't understand 
what's happening here," he said, 
"but I have the feeling that it's 
good. Priscilla, why did you come 
here?" 

She looked at him and said nothing. 

"What made you come back?" 

She shook her head. 

"You know," he smiled, "but 
you're just not talking. You've 
never done a wiser thing than to 
come back. If yt>u hadn't, Edie and 
I would have been driven apart just 
as surely as if you'd used a wedge. 
Am I right, Edie?" 

Edie nodded. "You've made us 
very happy." 

Priscilla felt embarrassed. "You 
are giving me an awful lot of 
credit," she said in a choked voice. 
I "I didn't really do anything. I wish 
I had the — the bigness or wisdom 



you think 1 have." She raised her 
eyes to them. "I'll try to live up 
to it, though. I will . . ." 

The phone rang. 

"Now who could that — " Jon 
reached for it. 

Priscilla took it out of his hand. 
"I'll take it." 

Edie and Jon looked at each 
other. Priscilla said into the phone, 
"Yes . . . yes, it's me. How in the 
world did you . . . Tonight? But 
it's so late! Will you be there? 
Then so will I. Oh, you're wonderful . . . yes, right away." 

She hung up. 

Jon said, "Who was it?" 

Priscilla laughed. "A friend." 

Jon touched her jaw. "All right, 
Miss Mysterious. What's it all 
about?" 

"Will you do something if I ask 
you? You, too, Edie?" 
"Oh, yes." 

Priscilla laughed again. "We do 
have something to celebrate, don't 
we?" When they nodded, she 
laughed again. "Well, come on!" 

IT WAS easier to carry the chopsticks piano-player with Derek 
to help, Jane concluded. She 
watched the rapt faces in the club. 
The house counted good, and it 
was going great, but she couldn't 
help thinking what it would be like 
if Derek hadn't been so pigheaded 
about little Henry. She finished her 
chorus and the piano took it up 
metronomically, nudged on the upbeats by the authoritative beat of 



RULE OF THREE 



97 



Derek's bass. She looked at him. 
He was playing steadily, almost absently. His face was sullen. When 
he got absentminded he wasn't 
colossal any more; only terrific. 

The piano moved through an obvious C-sharp seventh chord to 
change key to F-sharp, her key for 
the windup. She drifted into the 
bridge section with a long glissando, and disgust moved into her 
face and Derek's in perfect sychronization as they realized that the 
pianist was blindly going into another 32 bars from the beginning. 

Derek doubled his beat and 
slapped the strings hard, and the 
sudden flurry of sound snapped the 
pianist out of it. Blushing, he recovered the fluff. Jane rolled her 
eyes up in despair and finished the 
number. To scattered applause she 
turned to the piano and said, 
"Tinkle some. Derek and I are going to take ten. And while you're 
tinkling," she added viciously, 
"practice, huh?" 

She smiled at the audience, 
crossed the stand and touched Derek's elbow. "I'm going behind that 
potted palm and flip my lid. Come 
catch it." 

He put his bass out of harm's 
way and followed her into the 
office. She let him pass her and 
slump down on the desk. She 
banged the door. 

"You—" 

He looked at her sullenly. "I 
know what you're going to say. I 
threw out the best ten fingers in 



the business. I told you I don't 
want to talk about it. You don't 
believe that, do you?" 

"I believe it," she said. Her eyes 
glittered. "Derek Jax, I love you." 

"Cut it out." 

"I'm not kidding. I'm not changing the subject, either. I love you 
this much. I'm going to call your 
hand, kid. I love you so much that 
I'm going to make you talk about 
what's with this business of Henry, 
or I'm going to see you walk out 
of here with, and into, your doghouse." 

"That don't make a hell of a lot 
of sense, Janie," he said uncomfortably. 

"No, huh? Listen, the guy I love 
talks to me. I understand him 
enough so he can talk to me. If he 
won't talk to me, it's because he 
thinks I won't understand. I think 
you see what I mean. I love the guy 
I think you are. If you won't talk 
about it, you're just not that guy. 
Maybe that doesn't mean anything 
to you." 

"Could be," he growled. He 
rose and stretched. "Well, guess 
I'll be going. Nice working with 
you, Janie." 

"So long," she said. She went 
and opened the door. 

"By God," he said, "you really 
mean it." 

She nodded. 

HE LICKED his lips, then bit 
them. He sat down. "Shut the 
door, Janie." 



98 




 



She shut the door and put her 
head against it. He flashed her a 
look. "What's the matter?" 

She said hoarsely, "I got something in my eye. Wait." Presently 
she swung around and faced him. 
Her smile was brilliant, her face 
composed. The vein in the side of 
her neck was thick and throbbing. 

"Jane . . ." he said with difficulty, "that Henry — did he ever 
make a pass at you?" 

"Why, you egghead. No! To him 
I'm something that makes music, 
like a saxophone. It's you he's interested in. Hell, did you see his 
face when you came in with your 
bass this afternoon? He'd rather 
play to that bass than go over the 
falls in a barrel with me. If that's 
all that was on your mind, forget 
it." 

"You make it tough for me," he 
said heavily. "I'll play it through 
for you a note at a time. Got a 
stick?" 

She rummaged in the desk 
drawer and found him a cigarette. 
He lit it and dragged until he 
coughed. She had never seen him 
like this. She said nothing. 

He seemed to appreciate that. 
He glanced at her and half his 
mouth flashed part of a smile. Then 
he said, "Did I ever tell you about 
Danny?" 

"No." 

"Kids together. Kids get close. 
He lived down the pike. I got 
caught in a root one time, swimming in a rock quarry. Danny 



seemed to know the instant I got 
tangled. He couldn't swim worth 
a damn, but in he came. Got me 
out, too." 

He dragged on his cigarette, still 
hungry, hot and harsh. The words 
came out, smoking. "There was a 
lot of stuff ... we played ball, we 
run away from home, we broke 
into an oT house and pried loose a 
toilet and threw it out a fourthfloor window onto a concrete walk. 
We done a lot. 

"We jived a lot. He had natural 
rhythm. We used to bang away on 
his ol' lady's piano. I played 
trumpet for a while, but what I 
wanted to do was play string bass. 
I wanted that real bad. 

"We grew up and he moved 
away. Some lousy job trying to 
learn cabinet-making. Saw him a 
couple times. Half-starved, but real 
happy. I was playing bass by then, 
some. Had to borrow a fiddle. 
Wanted my own instrument so bad, 
never had the money. So one day 
he called me up Ions distance. 
Come over. I didn't have no trainfare, so I hitchhiked. Met him at a 
barrelhouse joint in town. He was 
real excited, dragged me out to his 
place. A shack — practically a 
shanty. When we got in sight of it 
he started to run. It was on iire." 

DEREK closed his eyes and 
went on talking. "We got to 
it and it was pretty far gone. I got 
there first. One wall was gone. Inside everything was burning. 



, RULE OF THREE 



99 



Danny, he — he screamed like a 
stung kid. He tried to jump inside. 
I hung on to him. Was much bigger' n him. Then I saw it — a string 
bass. A full-size string bass, burning up. I sat on Danny and watched 
it burn. I knew why he'd moved 
out of town. I knew why he cook 
up cabinet-making. I knew why he 
was so hungry an' — an' so happy. 
Made the box with his own two 
hands. We watched it burn and he 
tried to fight me because I would 
not let him save it. He cried. Well 
— we cried. Just two kids." 

Jane said a single, unprintable 
word with a bookful of feeling behind it. 

"We got over it. We roomed together after that. We done everything together. Crowd we ran with 
used to kid us about it, and that 
just made it better. I guess we were 
about nineteen then." 

He squeezed out a long breath 
and looked up at her with stretched, 
blind eyes. "We had something, 
see? Something clean and big that 
never happened before, and wasn't 
nothing wrong with it. 

"Then I come home one night 
and he's at the back window staring into the yard. Said he was moving out. Said we weren't doing each 
other any good. He was in bad 
shape. Somebody'd been talking to 
him, some lousy crumb with a 
sewer mouth and sewer ideas. I 
didn't know what it was all about. 
We were still just kids, see? 

"Anyway, I couldn't talk him out 



out of it. He left. He was halfcrazy, all eaten up. Like the time 
we watched the bull-fiddle burn up. 
He wouldn't say what was the trouble. So after he went I milled 
around the joint trying to make 
sense out of it and I couldn't. Then 
I—" 

Derek's voice seemed to desert 
him. He coughed hard and got it 
back. " — Then I went and looked 
out the window. Somebody'd wrote 
our names on the fence. Drew a 
heart around 'em. 

"I never gave a damn what anyone thought, see? But Danny, he 
did. I guess you can't know how 
someone else feels, but you can get 
a pretty fair idea. First I was just 
mad, and then I pretended I was 
Danny looking at a thing like that, 
and I got an idea how bad it was. I 
ran out lookin' for him. 

"Saw him after a time. Up by 
the highway, staggering a bit like 
he was half-soused. He wasn't, 
though. I ran after him. He was 
waiting for the light to change. 
There was a lot of traffic. Tried to 
get to him. Couldn't begin to. He 
sort of pitched off the curb right 
under oh my God I can still see it 
the big dual wheel it run right over 
his head . . ." he finished in a rapid 
monotone. 

JANE put her hand on his shoulder. Derek said, "I didn't know 
then and I don't know now and I 
never will know if he was so tore 
up and sick he just fell, or if he 



100 




 



done it on purpose. All I know is 
I've lived ever since with the idea 
I killed him just by being around 
him so much. Don't try to talk me 
out of it. I know it don't make 
sense. I know all the right answers. 
But knowing don't help. 

"That's the whole story." 

Jane waited a long time and then 
said gently, "No, Derek." 

He started as if he had suddenly 
found himself in an utterly strange 
place. Gradually his sense of presence returned to him and he wiped 
his face. 

"Yeah," he said. "Your boy 
Henry. Danny — he played piano, 
Janie. I started with him. Danny 
played piano like nothing that ever 
lived except this Henry. Everything 
I ever drug out of a string bass was 
put in there first by the way he 
played piano. He used to sit and 
play like that and every once in a 
while grin at me. Shy. 

"So I walk in here on a guy 
playing that kind of piano and he 
grins shy like that when he plays, 
and besides, here's that real close 
stuff around him like a fog. That 
Henry's a genius, Janie. And he's 
a — he's the type of guy they ought 
to use for a mold to make people 
out of. And he just wants to be 
near my fiddle. And me. And you 
want me to keep him around here 
until he knocks hisself off. 

"Janie," he said, with agony in 
his voice, "I'm not goin' through 
that again!" 

Jane squeezed his shoulder. She 



looked back over the afternoon and 
evening and words flitted through 
her mind: "You won't have to lose 
any sleep over him" . . . "Looks 
like you've made a conquest" . . . 
"Did he ever make a pass at you?" 
Aloud she told him, "I've sure said 
all the right things . . . take a swing 
at me, pudd'nhead." 

Derek pulled her hand close 
against his cheek and pressed it 
there so hard it hurt her. She let 
him do it as long as he wanted. "I 
love you, Janie," he whispered. "I 
shoulda told you all that about 
Danny a long time ago." 

"How could you tell till you 
tried?" she asked huskily. "Let's go 
on out there before oT Kitten on 
the Keys drives all the customers 
away." 

<<T CAN'T go in there," said 
-L Henry Faulkner in genuine 
panic. 

"You can and you will," said the 
old lady firmly. 

"Listen, there's a man in there 
who'll throw me out on sight." 

"Have I been wrong yet? This 
is your night to do as you're told, 
young man, and that's the way it 
is." 

In spite of himself he grinned. 
They went in through the herculite 
doors. Janie was just finishing a 
number. The piano fluffed the last 
chorus badly. Henry and the old 
lady stood in the back of the club 
until Derek and Jane walked off 
the floor. 



RULE OF THREE 



10T 



"Now," she said briskly, "go on 
up there and play for me. Play 
anything you want to." 

"But they have a piano player!" 

"He's in a pet. Just go up there." 

"Wh-what'll I say to him?" 

"Don't say anything, silly! Just 
stand there. He'll go away." 

He hesitated, and the lady gave 
him a small shove. He shambled 
around the dance floor and diffidently approached the piano. 

The pianist was playing a dingdong version of Stardust. He saw 
Henry coming. "You again." 

Henry said nothing. 

"I suppose you want to take my 
job again." 

Henry still said nothing. The 
man went on playing. Presently, 
"You can have it. How anyone can 
work with a couple sourpusses like 
that . . ." He got off the stool in 
mid-chorus, leaving Stardust's garden gate musically ajar. Henry's 
right hand shot out and, catching 
the chord as if it had been syncopated instead of shut off, began 
molding it like a handful of soft 
clay. He sat down still playing. 

EDIE said, "1 can't help feeling 
a little peculiar. This is wonderful, so wonderful — but there 
are still two of us and one of you." 

"Three of us," corrected Priscilla. 

"In some ways that's so," said 
Jon. He swallowed the rest of his 
drink and beckoned the waiter. 
"Pris is the best statistician and 



psychological steno I've ever run 
across. And you're a genius with 
the machines. Why, between us we 
will do research that'll make history." 

"Of course we will. But — isn't 
three a crowd ?" 

Priscilla said, without malice, 
"From anyone but you I'd consider 
that a hint. Don't worry about me. 
I have the most wonderful feeling 
that the miracles aren't finished." 

"Pris, are you ever going to tell 
us about the miracles?" 

"I don't know, Jon. Perhaps." 
Her eyes searched the club. Suddenly they fixed on a distant corner 
table. "There she is!" 

"Who?" Jon twisted around. 
"Well, I'll be damned!" 

"What is it?" asked Edie. 

"Excuse me," said Jon, and rose. 
"Someone I've got to see." He 
stalked over to the corner table and 
glowered down at its occupants. 
"May I ask what you're doing 
here?" 

"Why, Dr. Prince!" said Pallas. 
"Imagine meeting you here!" 

"What are you two doing here 
at this time of night?" 

"We can go where we like," said 
Verna, smoothing her snowy hair, 
"and that's the way it is." 

. "We're not due to report to you 
until the day after tomorrow," said 
Pallas self-righteously. 

"There's no law against a lady 
having a spot at bedtime," amended Verna. 

"You two never cease to amaze 



102 




 



me," Jon said, chuckling in spite 
of himself. "Just be careful. I'd 
hate to see my prize exhibits get 
hurt.'* 

They smiled up at him. "We'll 
be all right. We'll talk to you again 
later, won't we, Verna?" 

"Oh, yes," said Verna. "Definitely. That's the way it is." 

STILL chuckling, Jon went back 
to his table. "There sits the 
damnedest pair of human beings 
I've encountered yet," he said as he 
sat down. "Three years ago they 
were senile psychotics, the two of 
them. As far as I can determine 
they had no special therapy — they 
were in the County Home, and as 
mindless as a human being can get 
and stay alive. First thing you know 
they actually started feeding themselves- — " 

"Pallas and Verna!" said Priscilla. "You've mentioned — holy 
Pete! Are you sure?" 

"Of course I'm sure. I'm on the 
Board out there. You know the case 
history. They have to report to me 
every sixty days." 

"Well— I— will— be— damned," 
Priscilla intoned, awed. 

"What is it, Pris? I didn't think 
you'd ever seen them. They've never 
been to the lab . . . Say, how did 
you recognize them just now?" 

"Could . . . could you bring them 
over?" 

"Oh, come now. This celebration 
is only for — " 

"I've heard enough to be curious 



about them," said Edie. "Do invite 
them, Jon." 

He shrugged and returned to the 
other table. In a moment he was 
back with the two spinsters. He 
drew out chairs for them in courtly 
fashion, and called a waiter. Pallas 
ordered a double rye, no chaser. 
Verna smiled like a kitten and ordered scotch on the rocks. "For our 
colds," she explained. 

"How long have you had colds?" 
he demanded professionally. 

"Oh, dear, we don't get colds," 
explained Verna sweetly. "That's 
because we drink our liquor 
straight." 

Dr. Jonathan Prince felt it within him to lay down the law at this 
point. A patient was a patient. But 
there was something in the air that 
prevented it. He found himself 
laughing again. He thought he saw 
Pallas wink at Priscilla and shake 
her head slightly, but he wasn't 
sure. He introduced the girls. Without the slightest hesitation he introduced Edie as "my wife." She 
colored and looked pleased. 

"Listen to that music," breathed 
Priscilla. 

"Thought you'd notice it," said 
Pallas, and smiled at Verna. 

They all listened. It was a modal, 
moody, rhythmic invention, built 
around a circle of chords in the 
bass which beat, and beat, and beat 
on a single sonorous tone. The 
treble progressed evenly, regularly, 
tripped up on itself and ran giggling around and through the steady 



RULE OF THREE 



103 



structure of the bass modulations, 
then sobered and marched again, 
but always full of suppressed mirth. 

Priscilla was craning her neck. "I 
can't see him!" 

Verna said, "Why don't you go 
up there, dear? I'm sure he would 
not mind." 

"Oh . . . really not?" She caught 
Pallas's eye. Pallas gave her one 
firm nod. Priscilla said, "Do you 
mind?" She slipped out of her chair 
and went up past the dance floor. 

"Look at her," breathed Edie. 
"She's got that — that 'miracle' expression again . . . Oh, Jon, she's 
so lovely." 

Jon said, looking at the spinsters, 
"What are you two hugging each 
other about?" 

HENRY looked up from the keyboard and smiled shyly. 
"Hello," Priscilla said. 
"Hello." He looked at her face, 
her hair, her body, her eyes. His 
shyness was there, and no boldness 
was present; he looked at her the 
way she listened to his music. It 
was personal and not aggressive. 
He moved over on the bench. "Sit 
down." 

Without hesitation she did. She 
looked at him, too — the hawk profile, the gentle gray-green eyes. 
"You play beautifully." 

"Listen." 

He played with his eyes on her 
face. His hands leaped joyfully like 
baby goats. Then they felt awe and 
hummed something. Henry stopped 



playing by ear. He began to sightread. 

Note followed note followed 
note for the line of her nose, and 
doubled and curved and turned 
back for her nostrils. The theme 
became higher and fuller and 
rounded and there was her forehead, and then there were colorful 
waves up and back for her hair. 
Here was a phrase for an earlobe, 
and one for the turn of the cheek, 
and now there were mysteries, two 
of them, long and subdued and 
agleam and end-tilted, and they 
were her eyes . . . 

DEREK came out of the office 
and stopped so abruptly that 
Jane ran into him. Before she could 
utter the first startled syllable, her 
breath was taken away in a great 
gasp. 

Derek turned and gestured at the 
music. "You — " 

She looked up at him, the furious 
eyes, the terrified trembling at the 
corners of his mouth. "No, Derek, 
so help me God, I didn't ask him 
to come back. I wouldn't do that, 
Derek. I ivouldn't." 

"You wouldn't," he agreed gently. "I know it, hon. I'm sorry. But 
out he goes." He strode out to the 
stand. Jane trotted behind him, and 
when they turned the corner she 
caught his arm so violently that her 
long fingernails sank into his flesh. 
"Watt!" 

There was a girl on the bench 
with Henry, and as he played he 



104 




 



stared at her face. His eyes moved 
over it, his own face moved closer. 
His hands made music like the almost visible current which flowed 
between them. Their lips touched. 

There was a tinkling explosion 
of sound from the piano that built 
up in fullness and sonority until 
Jane and Derek all but blinked 
their eyes, as if it were a blaze of 
light. And then Henry's left hand 
picked up a theme, a thudding, joyous melody that brought the few 
late-owls, in the club right to their 
feet. He no longer looked at the 
girl. His eyes were closed, and his 
hands spoke of himself and what 
he felt — a great honest hunger and 
new riches, a shy and willing experience with a hitherto undreamedof spectrum of sensation. 

Jane and Derek looked at each 
other with shining eyes. Jane said, 
deliberately, "Son, you got a rival," 
and Derek laughed in sheer relieved delight. 

"I'm going to get my fiddle," he 
said. 

When Derek started to play, four 
people left their table and came up 
to the piano as if cables drew them. 
Hand in hand, Jon and Edie 
stopped close by Priscilla and stood 
there, rapt as she. Pallas and Verna 
stood at the other end of the bench, 
their eyes glowing. 

And out of the music, out of the 
bodies that fell into synchronization with the masterful pulse of the 
great viol, came a union, a blending 
of forces from each of six people. 



Each of the six had a part that was 
different from all of the others, but 
the shape of them all was a major 
chord, infinitely complete and completely satisfying. 

«T>IL!" 

J.V "Oh, make it formal, KadKedKud !" 

"RilRylRul, then . . ." 

"If only Mak were here." 

"Myk is with us, and Muk. Poor 
partial things, and how hard they 
have worked, guarding and guiding 
with those pitifully inadequate human bodies as instruments. Come, 
Ril; we must decide. Now that we 
can operate fully, we can investigate these creatures." 

Just as they had investigated, 
compared, computed and stored 
away observations on industrial 
techniques, strength of materials, 
stress and temperature and power 
and design, so now they took instant.and total inventory of their 
hosts. 

RilRylRul found classicism and 
inventiveness, tolerance and empathy in Henry. In Derek were loyalty and rugged strength and a 
powerful interpretive quality. In 
Jane was the full-blown beauty of 
sensualism and directive thought, 
and a unique stylization of the 
products of artistic creation. 

KadKedKud separated and analyzed a splendid systematization in 
Priscilla, a superior grasp of applied theory in Edie, and in Jon 
that rarest of qualities, the asso

ciative mind — the mind that can 
bridge the specialties. 

"A great race," said Ril, "but a 
sick one, badly infected with the 
Pa'ak pestilence." 

"The wisest thing to do," reflected Kad, "would be to stimulate the virus to such an extent that 
humanity will impose its own quarantine — by reducing itself to savagery through atomic warfare. 
There is such a great chance of 
that, no matter what we do, that it 
would seem expedient to hasten the 
process. The object would be to 
force atomic warfare before space 
travel can begin. That at least would 
keep the virus out of the Galaxy, 
which is what we came here to 
effect." 

"It's a temptation," conceded 
Ril. "And yet — what a tremendous 
species this human race could be! 
Let us stay, Kad. Let us see what 
we can do with them. Let us move 
on to other human groups, . now 
that we know the techniques of 
entry and merging. With just the 
right pressure on exactly the right 
points, who knows? Perhaps we 
can cause them to discover how-to 
cure themselves." 

"It will be a close race," worried Kad. "We can do a great deal, 
but can we do it soon enough? We 
face three possibilities: Mankind 
may destroy itself through its own 
sick ingenuity; it may reach the 
Stars to spread its infection; or it 
may find its true place as a healthy 
species in a healthy Cosmos. I 



would not predict which is more 
likely." 

"Neither would I," Ril returned. 
"So if the forces are that closely 
balanced, I have hope for the one 
we join. Are you with me?" 

"Agreed. Myk — Muk . . . will 
you join us?" 

Faintly, faintly came the weak 
response of the two paltry parts of 
a once powerful triad: "Back in our 
sector we would be considered 
dead. Here we have a life, and 
work. Of course we will help." 

So they considered, and, at 
length, decided. 

And their meeting and consideration and decision took four microseconds. 

THE six people looked at one another, entranced, dazed. 
"It's — gone," said Jon. He wondered, then, what he meant by 
that. 

Henry's fingers slid off the keys, 
and the big bass was silent. Priscilla opened her tilted eyes wide 
and looked about her. Edie pressed 
close to Jonathan, bright-faced, 
composed. Jane stood with her head 
high, her nostrils arched. 

They felt as if they were suddenly living on a new plane of existence, where colors were more vivid 
and the hues between them more 
recognizable. There was a new richness to the air, and a new strength 
in their bodies; but most of all it 
was as if a curtain had been lifted

from their minds for the first time 
in their lives. They had all reached 
a high unity, a supreme harmony 
in the music a second before, but 
this was something different, infinitely more complete. "Cured" was 
the word that came to Jonathan. 
He knew instinctively that what he 
now felt was a new norm, and that 
it was humanity's birthright. 

"My goodness gracious!" 

Verna and Pallas stood close together, like two frightened birds, 
darting glances about them and 
.twittering. 

"I can't think what I'm doing 
here," said Pallas blankly, yet 
aware. "I've had one of my 
spells . . ." 

"We both have," Verna agreed. 
"And that's the way it is." 

Jonathan looked at them, and 
knew them instantly as incomplete. 

He raised his eyes to the rest of 
the people in the club, still stirring 
with the final rustle of applause 
from the magnificent burst of music they had heard, and he recognized them as sick. His mind 
worked with a new directiveness 
and brilliance to the causes of their 
sickness. 



He turned to Edie. "We have 
work to do . . ." 

She pressed his hand, and Priscilla looked up and smiled. 

Derek and Jane looked into each 
other's eyes, into depths neither 
had dreamed of before. There 
would be music from that, they 
knew. 

Henry said, with all his known 
gentleness and none of the frightened diffidence, "Hey, you with the 
red hair. I love you. What's your 
name?" And Priscilla laughed with 
a sound like wings and buried her 
face in his shoulder.

Somewhere is an ideal mate

bet on it. He was a man 
who rolled his own!

THE pressure tube locks 
clicked behind them, as the 
train moved on. It was a 
strange, sighing click and to Joe it 
sounded like, "She's not right — 
she's not right — she's not right — " 
So, finally, he said it. "She's not 
right." 

Sam, who was riding with him, 
looked over wonderingly. "Who 
isn't?" 

"Vera. My wife. She's not 
right." 

Sam frowned. "Are you serious, 
Joe? You mean she's — ?" He 
tapped his temple. 

"Oh, no. I mean she's not what 
I want." 

"That's why we have the Center," Sam answered, as if quoting, 
which he was. "With the current 



and growing preponderance of 
women over men, something had 
to be done. I think we've done it." 

Sam was the Director of the Domestic Center and a man sold on 
his job. 

"You've done as well as you 
could," Joe agreed in an argumentative way. "You've given some 
reason and order to the marital 
competition among women. You've 
almost eliminated illicit relations. 
You've established a basic security 
for the kids. But the big job? 
You've missed It completely." 

"Thanks," Sam- said. "That's a 
very small knife you've inserted 
between my shoulder blades, but 
I'm thin-skinned." He took a deep 
breath. "What, in the opinion of 
the Junior Assistant to the Adju

109 



tant Science Director, was the big 
job?" 

Joe looked for some scorn in 
Sam's words, found it, and said, 
"The big job is too big for a sociologist." 

Sam seemed to flinch. "I didn't 
think that axe would fit alongside 
the knife. I underestimated you." 

"No offense," Joe said. "It's just 
that you have to deal with human 
beings." 

"Oh," Sam said. "Now it 
comes. You know, for a minute I 
forgot who you were. I forgot you 
were the greatest living authority 
on robots. I was thinking of you 
as my boyhood chum, good old 
Joe. You're beyond that now, 
aren't you?" 

"Beyond my adolescence? I 
hope so, though very few people 
are." Joe looked at Sam squarely. 
"Every man wants a perfect wife, 
doesn't he?" 

Sam shrugged. "I suppose." 

"And no human is perfect, so 
no man gets a perfect wife. Am I 
right, so far?" 

"Sounds like it." 

"Okay." Joe tapped Sam's chest 
with a hard finger. "I'm going to 
make a perfect wife." He tapped 
his own chest. "For me, just for 
me, the way I want her. No human frailties. Ideal." 

"A perfect robot," Sam objected. 

"A wife," Joe corrected. "A person. A human being." 

"But without a brain." 

"With a brain. Do you know 



anything about cybernetics, Sam?" 

"I know just as much about cybernetics as you know about people. Nothing." 

"fpHAT'S not quite fair. I'm 
J- not sentimental about people, 
but it's inaccurate to say I don't 
know anything about them. I'm a 
person. I think I'm — discerning 
and sensitive." 

"Sure," Sam said. "Let's drop 
the subject." 
"Why?" 

"Because you're talking nonsense. A person without faults is 
not a person. And if — it or he — 
she were, I don't think I'd care to 
know him or her or it." 

"Naturally. You're a sentimentalist. You've seen so much misery, 
so much human error, so much stupidity that you've built up your 
natural tolerance into a sloppy and 
unscientific sentimentality. It happens to sociologists all the time." 

"Joe, I'm not going to argue 
with you. Only one thing I ask. 
When you — break the news to 
Vera, break it gently. And get her 
back to the Center as quickly as 
you can. She's a choice, rare number.." 

Joe said nothing to that. Sam 
looked miserable. They sat there, 
listening to the swishing, burring 
clicks of the airlocks, two friends 
— one who dealt with people and 
had grown soft, the other who 
dealt with machines and might not 
have grown at all.

As the car rose for the Inglewood station, Sam looked over, but 
Joe's eyes were straight ahead. Sam 
got up and out of the seat. 

There was a whispering sigh of 
escaping air and the sunlight glare 
of the Inglewood station, synthetic 
redwood and chrome and marble. 

Sam was out of the cylindrical, 
stainless steel car and hurrying for 
the Westchester local when Joe 
came out onto the platform. Sam 
was annoyed, it was plain. 

Joe's glance went from his hurrying friend to the parking lot, and 
his coupe was there with Vera behind the wheel. It was only a three 
block walk, but she had to be there 
to meet him, every evening. That 
was her major fault, her romantic 
sentimentality. 

"Darling," she said, as he approached the coupe. "Sweetheart. 
Have a good day?" 

He kissed her casually. "Ordinary." She slid over and he climbed 
in behind the wheel. "Sat with Sam 
Tullgren on the train." 

"Sam's nice." 

He turned on the ignition and 
said, "Start." The motor obediently started and he swung out of the 
lot, onto Chestnut. "Sam's all right. 
Kind of sentimental." 

"That's what I mean." 

JOE was silent. The coupe went 
past a row of solar homes and 
turned on Fulsom. Three houses 
from the corner, he turned into 
their driveway. 



"You're awfully quiet," Vera 
said. 

"I'm thinking." 

"About what?" Her voice was 
suddenly strained. "Sam didn't try 
to sell you — " 

"A new wife?" He looked at 
her. "What makes you think 
that?" 

"You're thinking about me, 
about trading me in. Joe, haven't 
I — darling, is there — ?" She broke 
off, looking even more miserable 
than Sam had. 

"I don't intend to trade- you in," 
he said quietly. 

She took a deep breath. 

He didn't look at her. "But 
you're going back to the Center." 

She stared at him, a film of moisture in her eyes. She didn't cry or 
ask questions or protest. Joe 
wished she would. This was worse. 

"It's not your fault," he said, 
after a moment. "I'm not going to 
get another. You're as ideal, almost, as a human wife can ever 
be." 

"I've tried so hard," she said. 
"Maybe I tried too hard." 

"No," he said, "it isn't your 
fault. Any reasonable man would 
be delighted with you, Vera. You 
won't be at the Center long." 

"I don't want a reasonable 
man," she said quietly. "I want 
you, Joe. I— I loved you." 

He had started to get out of the 
car. He paused to look back. 
"Loved? Did you use the past 
tense?" 



MADE TO MEASURE 



111 



"I used the past tense." She 
started to get out on her side of the 
car. "I don't want to talk about it." 

"But I do," he told her. "Is this 
love something you can turn on 
and off like a faucet?" 

"I don't care to explain it to 
you," she said. "I've got to pack." 
She left the car, slammed the door, 
and moved hurriedly toward the 
house. 

Joe watched her. Something was 
troubling him, something he 
couldn't analyze, but he felt certain that if he could, it would prove 
to be absurd. 

He went thoughtfully into the 
living room and snapped on the 
telenews. He saw troops moving 
by on foot, a file of them dispersed 
along a Brazilian road. He turned 
the knob to another station and 
saw the huge stock market board, 
a rebroadcast. Another twist and 
he saw a disheveled, shrieking woman being transported down some 
tenement steps by a pair of policemen. The small crowd on the sidewalk mugged into the camera. 

He snapped it off impatiently 
and went into the kitchen. The 
dinette was a glass-walled alcove 
off this, and the table was set. 
There was food on his plate, none 
on Vera's. 

HE WENT to the living room 
and then, with a mutter of 
impatience, to the door of the back 
bedroom. She had her grips open 
on the low bed. 



"You don't have to leave tonight, you know." 
"I know." 

"You're being very unreasonable." 
"Am I?" 

"I wasn't trying to be intentionally cruel." 

"Weren't you?" 

His voice rose. "Will you stop 
talking like some damned robot? 
Are you a human being, or aren't 
you?" 

"I'm afraid I am," she said, 
"and that's why I'm going back to 
the Center. I've changed my mind. 
I want to get registered. I want to 
find a man." 

She started to go past him, her 
grip in her hand. He put a hand 
on her shoulder. "Vera, you — " 

Something flashed toward his 
face. It was her slim, white hand, 
but it didn't feel slim and white. 
She said, "I can see now why you 
weren't made Settlor Assistant to 
the Adjutant Science Director. 
You're a stupid, emotionless mechanic. A machine." 

He was still staring after her 
when the door slammed. He 
thought of the huge Domestic Center with its classes in Allure, Boudoir Manners, Diet, Poise, Budgeting. That vast, efficient, beautifully 
decorated Center which was the 
brain child of Sam Tullgren, but 
which still had to deal with imperfect humans. 

People, people, people . . . and 
particularly women. He rose, after 



112 




 



a while, and went into the dinette. 
He sat down and stared moodily 
at his food. 

Little boys are made of something and snails and puppydogs' 
tails. What are little girls made 
of? Joe didn't want a little girl; 
he wanted one about a hundred 
and twenty-two pounds and five 
feet, four inches high. He wanted 
her to be flat where she should be 
and curved where she should be, 
with blonde hair and gray-green 
eyes and an exciting smile. 

He had a medical degree, among 
his others. The nerves, muscles, 
flesh, circulatory system could be 
made — and better than they were 
ever made naturally. The brain 
would be cybernetic and fashioned 
after his own, with his own mental background stored in the memory circuits. 

So far, of course, he had described nothing more than a robot 
of flesh and blood. The spark, now 
— what distinguished the bettergrade robots from people? Prenatal heat, that was it. Incubation. 
A mold, a heated mold. Warmth, 
the spark, the sun, life. 

FOR the skin, he went to Pete 
Celano, the top syntho-dermatologist in the Department. 

"Something special?" Pete asked. 
"Not just a local skin graft? What 
then?" 

"A wife. A perfect wife." 
Pete's grin sagged bafHedly. "I 
don't get it, Joe. Perfect how?" 



"In all ways." Joe's face was 
grave. "Someone ideal to live 
with." 

"How about Vera? What was 
wrong with her?" 

"A sentimentalist, too romantic, 
kind of — well, maybe not dumb, 
exactly, but — " 

"But not perfect. Who is, Joe?" 

"My new wife is going to be." 

Pete shrugged and began putting 
together the ingredients for the 
kind of skin Joe had specified. 

They're all the same, Joe 
thought, Sam and Pete and the 
rest. They seemed to think his idea 
childish. He built the instillers and 
incubator that night. The mold 
would be done by one of the Department's engravers. Joe had the 
sketches and dimensions ready. 

Wednesday afternoon, Burke 
called him in. Burke was the Senior assistant, a job Joe had expected 
and been miffed about. Burke was 
a jerk, in Joe's book. 

This afternoon, 'Burke's long 
nose was twitching and his thin 
face was gravely bleak. He had a 
clipped, efficient way of speaking. 

"Tired, Joe?" 

"What do you mean?" 

"Not hitting the ball, not on the 
beam, no zipperoo." 

"I'm — yes, I guess you're right. 
I've been working at home on a 
private project." 

"Scientific?" 

"Naturally." 

"Anything in particular?" 

Joe took a breath, looked away, 



MADE TO MEASURE 



113 



and back at Burke. "Well, a wife." 

A frown, a doubtful look from 
the cold, blue eyes. "Robot? Dishwasher and cook and phone answerer and like that?" 

"More than that." 

Slightly raised eyebrows. 

"More?" 

"Competely human, except she 
will have no human faults." 

Cool smile. "Wouldn't be human, then, of course." 

"Human, but without human 
faults, I said!" 

"You raised your voice, Joe." 

"I did." 

"I'm the Senior Assistant. Junior Assistants do not raise their 
voices to Senior Assistants." 

"I thought you might be deaf, 
as well as dumb," Joe said. 

A silence. The granite face of 
Burke was marble, then steel and 
finally chromium. His voice 
matched it. "I'll have to talk to the 
Chief before I fire you, of course. 
Department rule. Good afternoon." 

"Go to hell." 

JOE went back to his desk and 
burned. He started with a low 
flame and fed it with the grievances 
of the past weeks. When it began 
to warm his collar, he picked up 
his hat and left. 

Click, burr, click went the airlocks. Very few riders, this time 
of the afternoon. The brain would 
go in, intact, and then the knowledge instiller would work during 



the incubation period, feeding the 
adolescent memories to the retentive circuits. She would really 
spend her mental childhood in the 
mold, while the warmth sent the 
human spark through her body. 

Robot? Huh! What did they 
know? A human being, a product 
of science, a flaw/ess human being. 

The rise, the big hiss of the final 
airlock, and Jnglewood. Joe stood 
on the platform a second, looking 
for his car, and then realized she 
wasn't there. She hadn't been there 
for a week, and he'd done that 
every night. Silly thing, habit. Human trait. 

Tonight, he'd know. The flesh 
had been in the mold for two days. 
The synthetic nerves were plump 
and white under the derma-ray, the 
fluxo heart was pumping steadily, 
the entire muscular structure kept 
under pneumatic massage for 
muscle tone. 

He'd thought of omitting the 
frowning muscles, but realized it 
would ruin the facial contours. 
They weren't, however, under 
massage and would not be active. 

And the mind? 

Well, naturally it would be 
tuned to his. She'd know everything he knew. What room was 
there for disagreement if the 
minds were the same? Smiling, as 
she agreed, because she couldn't 
frown. Her tenderness, her ro-. 
manticism would have an intensity 
variable, of course. He didn't want 
one of these grinning simperers. 



114 




 



He remembered his own words: 
"Is this love something you can 
turn on and off like a faudet?" 
Were his own words biting him, or 
only scratching him? Something 
itched. An intensity variable was 
not a faucet, though unscientific 
minds might find a crude, allegorical resemblance. 

To hell with unscientific minds. 

He went down to the basement. 
The mold was 98.6. He watched 
the knowledge instiller send its 
minute current to the head end of 
the mold. The meter read less than 
a tenth of an amp. The slow, plastic pulse of the muscle tone massage worked off a small pump near 
the foot of the mold. 

On the wall, the big master 
operating clock sent the minute 
currents to the various bodily sections, building up the cells, maintaining the organic functions. In 
two hours, the clock would shut off 
all power, the box would cool, and 
there would be his — Alice. Well, 
why not Alice? She had to have a 
name, didn't she? 

WARMTH, that was the difference between a human and 
a robot, just warmth, just the 
spark. Funny he'd never thought 
of it before. Warmth was — it had 
unscientific connotations. It wasn't, 
though. 

He went upstairs and fried some 
eggs. Twice a day, for a week, he 
had fried eggs. Their flavor was 
overrated. 



Then he went into the living 
room and snapped on the ball 
game. 

Martin was on third and Pelter 
was at bat. On the mound, the lank 
form of Dorffberger cast a long, 
grotesque shadow in the afternoon 
sun. Dorffberger chewed and spat 
and wiped his nose with the back 
of his glove. He looked over at 
third and yawned. 

At the plate, Pelter was digging 
in. Pelter looked nervous. 

Joe said, "Bet that Dorffberger 
fans him. He's got the Indian sign 
on Pelter." 

Then he realized he was talking 
to himself. Damn it. On the telenews screen, Dorffberger looked 
right into the camera and nodded. 
He was winding up, and the director put the ball into slow motion. 
Even in slow motion, it winged. 

"Ho-ho!" Joe said. "You can't 
hit what you can't see." 

Pelter must have seen it. He 
caught it on the fat part of the 
bat, twisting into it with all his 
hundred and ninety pounds. The 
impact rattled the telenews screen 
and the telescopic cameras took 
over. They followed the ball's 
flight about halfway to Jersey and 
then the short-range eyes came back 
to show Pelter crossing the plate, 
and Martin waiting there to shake 
his hand. 

Joe snapped off the machine impatiently. Very unscientific game, 
baseball. No rhyme or reason to it. 
He went out onto the porch.

The grass was dry and gray; he'd 
forgotten to set the sprinkler clock, 
Vera's old job. Across the street, 
Dan Harvey sat with his wife, each 
with a drink. Sat with his human 
wife, the poor fish. They looked 
happy, though. Some people were 
satisfied with mediocrities. Unscientific people. 

Why was he restless? Why was 
he bored? Was he worried about 
his job? Only slightly; the Chief 
thought a lot of him, a hell of a 
lot. The Chief was a great guy for 
seniority and Burke had it, or Joe 
would certainly have been Senior 
Assistant. 

The stirring in him he didn't 
want to analyze and he thought of 
the days he'd courted Vera, going 
to dances at the Center, playing 
bridge at the Center, studying 
Greek at the Center. A fine but 
too well-lighted place. You could 
do everything but smooch there; 
the smooching came after the declaration of intentions and a man 
was bound after the declaration to 
go through with the wedding, to 
live with his chosen mate for the' 
minimum three months of the adjustment period. 

ADJUSTMENT period ... another necessity for humans, 
for imperfect people. Across the 
street, the perfectly adjusted Harveys smiled at each other and 
sipped their drinks. Hell, that 
wasn't adjustment, that was surrender. 




He got up and went into the 
living room; fighting the stirring 
in him, the stirring he didn't want 
to analyze and find absurd. He 
went into the bathroom and studied 
his lean, now haggard face. He 
looked like hell. He went into the 
back bedroom and smelled her perfume and went quickly from the 
house and into the backyard. 

He sat there until seven, listening to the throb from .the basement. The molecule agitator should 
have the flesh firm and finished 
now, nourished by the select blood, 
massaged by the pulsating plastic. 

At seven, she should be ready. 

At seven, he went down to the 
basement. His heart should have 
been hammering and his mind expectant, but he was just another 
guy going down to the basement. 

The pumps had stopped, the agi

tator, the instiller. He felt the 
mold; it was cool to the touch. He 
lifted the lid, his mind on Vera for 
some reason. 

A beauty. The lid was fully back 
and his mate sat up, smiled and 
said, "Hello, Joe." 

"Hello, Alice. Everything all 
right?" 

"Fine." 

Her hair was a silver blonde, her 
features a blend of the patrician 
and the classical. Her figure was 
neither too slim nor too stout, too 
flat nor too rounded. Nowhere was 
there any sag. 

"Thought we'd drop over to the 
Harveys' for a drink," Joe said. 
"Sort of show you off, you know." 

"Ego gratification, Joe?" 

"Of course. I've some clothes upstairs for you." 

"I'm sure they're lovely." 



"They are lovely.' 

While she dressed, he phoned 
the Harveys. He explained about 
Vera first, because Vera was what 
the Harveys considered a good 
neighbor. 

Dan Harvey said sympathetically, 
"It happens to the best of us. 
Thinking of getting a new one, 
Joe?" 

'Tve got one right here. 
Thought I'd drop over, sort of 
break the ice." 

"Great," Dan said. "Fine. 
Dandy." 

The event was of minor importance, except for the revelation involved. 

The Harveys had a gift for putting guests at ease, the gift being 
a cellar full of thirty-year-old bourbon the elder Harvey had bequeathed them at the end of their 
adjustment period. 

The talk moved here and there, 
over the bourbon, Alice sharing in 
it rarely, though nodding when 
Joe war, talking. 

Then, at mention of someone or 
other, Mrs. Harvey said tolerantly, 
"Well, none of us are perfect, I 
guess." 

Alice smiled and answered, 
"Some of us are satisfied with 
mediocrities in marriage." 

Mrs. Harvey frowned doubtfully. "I don't quite understand, 
dear. In any marriage, there has to 
be adjustment. Dan and I, for example, have adjusted very well." 

"You haven't adjusted," Alice

said smilingly. "You've surrendered." 

Joe coughed up half a glass of 
bourbon, Dan turned a sort of redgreen and Mrs. Harvey stared with 
her mouth open. Alice smiled. 

Finally, Mrs. Harvey said, 
"Well, I never—" 

"Of all the — " Dan Harvey said. 

Joe rose and said, "Must get to 
bed, got to get to bed." 

"Here?" Alice asked. 

"No, of course not. Home. Let's 
go, dear. Have to rush." 

Alice's smile had nothing sentimental about it. 

HE DIDN'T berate her until 
morning. He wanted time to 
cool off, to look at the whole thing 
objectively. It just wouldn't get objective, though. 

At breakfast, he said, "That was 
tactless last night. Very, very tactless." 

"Yes, Joe. Tact requires deception. Tact is essentially deception." 

When had he said that ? Oh, yes, 
at the Hydra Club lecture. And it 
was true and he hated deception 
and he'd created a wife without 
one. 

He said, "I'll have to devise a 
character distiller that won't require putting you back in the 
mold." 

"Of course, dear. Why?" 

"You need just a touch of deception, just a wee shade of it." 

"Of course, Joe." 

So she had tact. 



He went to the office with very 
little of the absurdity mood stirring 
in him. He'd had a full breakfast, 
naturally. 

At the office, there was a note 
on his desk: Mr. Bebrens wants to 
see you immediately. It bore his 
secretary's initials. Mr. Behrens 
was the Chief. 

He was a fairly short man with 
immense shoulders and what he'd 
been told was a classical head. So 
he let his hair grow, and had a 
habit of thrusting his chin forward 
when he listened. He listened to 
Joe's account of the interview with 
Burke. 

When Joe had finished, the 
Chief's smile was tolerant. "Ribbing him, were you? Old Burke 
hasn't much sense of humor, Joe." 

Joe said patiently, "I wasn't ribbing him. I took her out of the 
mold last night. I ate breakfast 
with her this morning. She's — 
beautiful, Chief. She's ideal." 

The Chief looked at him for 
seconds, his head tilted. 

Joe said, "Heat, that's what does 
it. If you'd like to come for dinner with us tonight, Chief, and see 
for yourself — " 

The Chief nodded. "I'd like 
that." • 

THEY left a little early to avoid 
the crowd in the tube. Burke 
saw them leaving, and his long 
face grew even longer. 

On the trip, Joe told his boss 
about the cybernetic brain, about 



118 




 



his background and his beliefs 
stored in the memory circuits, and 
the boss listened quietly, not committing himself with any comments. 

But he did say, "I certainly 
thought a lot of Vera. You 
wouldn't have to warm her in any 
incubating mold." 

"Wait'll you see this one," Joe 
said. 

And when she walked into the 
living room at home, when she acknowledged the introduction to the 
Chief, Joe knew the old boy was 
sold. The Chief could only stare. 

Joe took him down to the basement then to show him the molecule agitator, the memory feeder, 
the instillers. 

The old boy looked it over and 
said, quite simply, "I'll be 
damned!" 

They went up to a perfect dinner — and incident number two. 

The Chief was a sentimentalist 
and he'd just lost a fine friend. 
This friend was his terrier, Murph, 
who'd been hit by a speeding car. 

The story of Murph from birth 
to death was a fairly long one, but 
never dull. The Chief had a way 
with words. Even Joe, one of the 
world's top-ranking non-sentimentalists, was touched by the tale. 
When they came to the end, where 
Murph had lain in his master's 
arms, whimpering, as though to 
comfort him, trying to lick his face, 
Joe's eyes were wet and the drink 
wobbled in his hand. 



The Chief finished in a whisper, 
and looked up from the carpet he'd 
been staring at through the account. 

And there was Alice, sitting 
erect, a smile of perfect joy on her 
face. "How touching," she said, 
and grinned. 

For one horror-stricken second, 
the Chief glared at her, and then 
his questioning eyes went to Joe. 

"She can't frown," Joe explained. "The muscles are there, 
but they need massage to bring 
them to life." He paused. "I wanted a smiling wife." 

The Chief inhaled heavily. 
"There are times when a smile is 
out of order, don't you think, Joe?" 

"It seems that way." 

It didn't take long. Massage, 
orientation, practice, concentration. 
It didn't take long, and she was so 
willing to cooperate. Golly, she 
was agreeable. She was more than 
that; she voiced his thoughts before 
he did. Because of the mental affinity, you see. He'd made sure of 
that. 

She could frown now and she 
had enough deception to get by in 
almost any company. These flaws 
were necessary, but they were still 
flaws and brought her closer to being — -human. 

AT THE office on Saturday 
morning, Sam Tullgren 
dropped in. Sam said, "I've been 
hearing things, Joseph." 

"From Vera? At the Center?" 



MADE TO MEASURE 



119 



Sam shook his head. "Vera's 
been too busy to have much time 
for the director. She's our most 
popular number." Sam paused. 
"About the new one. Hear she's 
something to see." 

"You heard right. She's practically flawless, Sam. She's just what 
a man needs at home." His voice, 
for some reason, didn't indicate the 
enthusiasm he should have felt. 

Sam chewed one corner of his 
mouth. "Why not bring her over, 
say, tonight? We'll play some 
bridge." 

That would be something. Two 
minds, perfectly in harmony, synchroni2ed, working in partnership. 
Joe's smile was smug. "We'll be 
there. At eight-thirty." 

Driving over to Westchester that 
night, Joe told Alice, "Sam's a 
timid bidder. His wife's inclined 
to overbid. Plays a sacrificing game 
when she knows it will gain 
points. Our job will be to make 
her oversacrifice." 

Sam's eyes opened at sight of 
her; his wife's narrowed. Joe took 
pride in their reaction, but it was 
a strange, impersonal pride. 

They had a drink and some 
small talk, and settled around the 
table. It was more like a seance 
than a game. 

They bid and made four clubs, 
a heart. Sam's wife got that determined look. With the opposition 
holding down one leg of the rubber, she figured to make the next 
bid a costly one. 



She won it with six diamonds, 
and went down nine tricks, doubled. Sam started to say something, 
after the debacle, but one look at 
his wife's anguished countenance 
stopped him short of audibility. 

Sam said consolingly, "I'm such 
a lousy bidder, dear. I must have 
given you the wrong idea of my 
hand." 

NEXT time, Sam made up for 
his timidity. Sam, with one 
heart in his hand, tried a psychic. 
"One heart," he said firmly. 

Sam knew there was a good 
chance the hearts were in the oppositions' hands, and this looked like 
a fine defensive tactic. 

However, his wife, with a threesuit powerhouse, couldn't conceive 
of a psychic from Sam. She had 
need of only a second round stopper in hearts and a small slam in 
no trump was in the bag. She had 
no hearts, but timid Sam was undoubtedly holding the ace-king. 

She bid six no-trump, which was 
conservative for her. She didn't 
want to make the mistake of having Sam let the bid die. 

Joe had the ace, king, queen and 
jack of hearts and a three to lead 
to Alice's hand. Alice finished up 
the hearts for a total of seven 
tricks, and this time it was Mrs. 
Tullgren who opened her mouth 
to speak. 

But she remembered Sam's kindness in the former hand, and she 
said, "It was all my fault, darling. 



120 




 



To think I couldn't recognize a 
psychic, just because it came from 
you. I think we're overmatched, 
sweet." She paused to smile at Joe. 
"Up against the man who invented 
the comptin-reduco-determina." She 
added, as an afterthought, "And 
his charming, brilliant new wife." 

Which brought about incident 
number three. 

Alice turned to Mrs. Tullgren 
sweetly and asked, "Don't you 
really understand the comptin-reduco-determina ?" 

"Not even faintly," Mrs. Tullgren answered. She smiled at 
Alice. 

The smile faded after about ten 
minutes. For Alice was telling her 
all about the comptin-reduco-determina. For an hour and nineteen 
minutes, Alice talked to this woman who had been humiliated 
twice, telling her all the things 
about the famous thinking machine 
that Mrs. Tullgren didn't want to 
know. 

It wasn't until Alice was through 
talking animatedly that the entranced Joe began to suspect that 
perhaps the Tullgrens weren't as 
interested in the dingus as a scientific mind would assume. 

They weren't. There was a strain 
after that, a decided heaviness to 
the rest of the evening. Sam seemed 
to sigh with relief when they said 
good night. 

In the car, Joe was thoughtful. 
Halfway home, he said, "Darling, 
I think you know too much — for 



a female, that is. I think you'll 
have to have a go with the knowledge-instiller. In reverse, of 
course." 

"Of course," she agreed. 

"I don't object to females knowing a lot. The world does." 

"Of course," she said. 

She was a first model and, therefore, experimental. These bugs 
were bound to show up. She was 
now less knowing, more deceptive, 
and she could frown. 

She began to remind him of 
Vera, which didn't make sense. 

Alice was sad when he was sad, 
gay when he was gay, and romantic 
to the same split-degree in the same 
split-second. She even told him his 
old jokes with the same inflection 
he always used. 

Their mood affinity was geared 
as closely as the comptin-reduco-determina. What more could a man 
want? And, damn it, why should 
Vera's perfume linger in that back 
bedroom ? 

THE fumigators could do nothing. They left, after the third 
trip, shaking their heads. Joe stood 
in the doorway, insisting he could 
still smell it. 

Alice said, "It's probably mental, dear. Perhaps you still — still — 
what's that word? Perhaps you still 
love her." 

"How could you think that?" he 
asked. "How? How could you 
think that unless I was thinking 
it?" 



MADE TO MEASURE 



121 



"I couldn't. I love you, too, Joe, 
but you know why that is." 

"What do you mean?" 

"We both love you, Joe." 

"Both? You and Vera?" 

"No. You and I, we both love 
you." 

"That," said Joe peevishly, "is 
ridiculous. If you could think for 
yourself, you'd know it was ridiculous." 

"Of course," she agreed. And 
frowned, because he was frowning. 

"You act like a robot," Joe said. 
She nodded. 

"That's all you are," Joe went 
on evenly, "a robot. No volition." 
She nodded, frowning. 
"I'm sick of it." 

She said nothing, sympathetically looking sick. 

And then he smiled and said, 
"I'm not stumped. Not the inventor 
of the comptin-reduco-determina. 
By Harry, I'll give you volition. 
I'll give you enough volition to 
make you dizzy." 

And because he was smiling, she 
was smiling. And only a very perceptive person might notice that 
her smile seemed to have an intensity, an anticipation slightly beyond his. 

He got to work on it that night. 
He would have to erase some of 
his mental 'background from her 
brain. He wanted her no less intelligent, no less discerning, but 
with enough of a change in background to give her a viewpoint of 



her own. He labored until midnight, and tumbled into bed with 
a headache. 

Next morning, at breakfast, he 
told her, "We'll try it out tonight. 
After that, you'll be a person." 

"Of course. And will you love 
me, Joe?" 

"More coffee, please," he answered. 

At the office, there was another 
note from his secretary: Air. Burke 
wants to see you. At your convenience. 

At your convenience ? Was Burke 
going soft? Joe went right in. 

BURKE was smiling, a miracle 
in itself. Burke's voice was 
jovial. "The Chief's been telling 
me about the new wife, Joe. I guess 
I owe you an apology." 

"Not at all," Joe said. "I had 
no right to be rude. I was a little 
overworked — at home. I wasn't myself." 

Burke nodded smugly, soaking 
it up. "Beautiful, the Chief tells 
me. Am I going to meet her, Joe?" 

"If you want. How about tonight, for dinner? I've got something new planned. I'm giving her 
volition. Maybe you'll want to 
watch." 

"Volition?" 

Joe went on to explain about 
volition, making it as simple as he 
could, to match Burke's mind. 

"That," Burke said when he'd 
finished, "I want to see." 

They went home in the crowded 



122 




 



Inglewood tube. Sam was there, but 
Sam seemed to avoid them, for 
some reason. All the way home, 
Joe had the uncomfortable feeling 
that Burke didn't believe any part 
of this business, that Burke was 
making the trip only to substantiate 
his own misconceptions. 

But when Alice came into the 
living room, smiling brightly, extending her hand to the Senior Assistant, Joe had a gratifying glimpse 
of Burke's face. 

Burke was lost. Burke stared and 
swallowed and grinned like a green 
stage hand at a burlesque show. 
Burke's smile was perpetual and 
nauseating. Even in the face of 
Alice's cool reserve. 

The dinner was fine, the liquor 
mellow. 

Then Joe said, "Well, Alice, it's 
time for the volition. It's time for 
your birth as a person." 

"Of course," she said, and 
smiled. 

They went down into the basement, the three of them; she sat in 
the chair he'd prepared and he 
clamped on the wired helmet and 
adjusted the electrodes. 

Burke said weakly, "It isn't — 
dangerous, is it?" 

"Dangerous?" Joe stared at him. 
"Of course not. Remember how 
I explained it?" 

"I — uh — my memory — " Burke 
subsided. 

She closed her eyes and smiled. 
Joe threw the switch. She'd have 
knowledge; she'd have the mem


ory of her past few days of existence as his alter ego. She'd have 
volition. 

The contact clock took over. Her 
eyes remained closed, but her smile 
began to fade as the second hand 
moved around and around the big, 
contact-studded dial. 

Joe was smiling, though she 
wasn't. Joe was filled with a sense 
of his own creative power, his own 
inventive genius and gratification 
at the worried frown on the face 
of the imbecile Burke. 

THEN the clock stopped and 
there was a buzz; the meters 
dropped to zero. Alice opened her 
eyes. For the first time, as a person, 
she opened her eyes. 

Her smile was back. But she 
was looking at Burke. Looking at 
Burke and smiling! 
"Baby," she said. 
Burke looked puzzled, but definitely pleased. In all Burke's adult 
life, no female had ever looked at 
him like that. 

Joe said tolerantly, "You're a 
little confused yet, Alice. I'm your 
husband." 

"You?" She stared at him. "Do 
you think I've forgotten you? Do 
you think I don't know you, after 
living inside your brain, almost? 
You monster, you egocentric, selfish, humorless walking equation. 
You're not my husband and I'd 
like to see you prove that you are." 

Now it was only Burke who 
smiled. "By George," he said,

123 



"that's right There's no wedding 
on record, is there, Joe?" 

"Wedding?" Joe repeated blankly. "I made her. I created her. Of 
course there's no — " 

"Of course, of course, of course," 
Alice shrilled. "That's all you 
know. You're the original 'of 
course' kid. Things aren't that certain, Junior. I've known you just 
long enough and just well enough 
to detest you." Now she pointed 
at Burke. "That's what I want. 
That's my kind of man." 

Burke gulped and grinned, nodded. "To coin a phrase, you said it, 
kiddo." He smiled at Joe. "I'll run 
her right down to the Center and 
get her registered, and take out an 
intent option. I guess we can't fight 
fate, Joe, can we?" 

Joe took a deep breath of air. 
"I guess not. I guess it's — (kismet." 

He was still standing there when 
he heard the front door slam. He 
kept staring at the machine, not 
seeing it, hearing instead all she 
had said. She knew him better than 
anyone who lived. Better, actually, 
than he knew himself, because she 
didn't rationalize, being outside his 
mental sphere now. You might say 
she'd been in his mind and detested what she had found there. 

It was a crawling feeling, the 
knowledge that he had been guilty 
of rationalization himself, that he 
had faults his mind refused to acknowledge. He couldn't doubt that 
he was all the cold and gruesome 
things she had called him. The 



worst shock, however, was that he 
had studied psychology and honestly had believed he was an objective 
thinker. 

But who, he realized, could be 
completely honest about himself? 

HE LOOKED at the machine 
and saw the non-rationalization electrodes. He had used that 
on her and she had seen clearly 
what he still couldn't recognize. 
What he needed, apparently, was 
a good, objective look at his own 
mind. 

He set the contact clock for ob



124 




 



jectivity maximum and clamped the 
electrodes on his head. He reached 
for the switch, had to close his eyes 
before he could throw it. 

He didn't see the second hand 
going around and around the 
clock, but he felt the prejudice-erasing impulses, the objective-appraisal stimuli, revealing 
memories that had shaped him, 
humiliations that had twisted him 
and been forgotten, urgings and 
longings and guilts that he had 
never known existed. 

He saw himself. It was highly 
unpleasant. 




There was a final buzz and the 
clock stopped. Joe opened his eyes, 
both figuratively and literally. He 
undamped the helmet with the 
electrodes and stepped from the 
chair, holding onto the arm, looking at the mirrored inside walls of 
the mold. 

He had made an image of himself and it had turned on him. Now 
he had made — what? An image of 
his image's image of him? It was 
very confusing, yet somehow clear. 

He went slowly up the stairs, 
smelling the perfume. It wasn't 
Alice's and that was peculiar, because she had practically swabbed 
herself with the stuff, knowing he 
liked it, and she had just left. 

It was Vera's perfume. 

He remembered her waiting at 
the station, making her ridiculous 
bids at the card table, gossiping 
witlessly with Mrs. Harvey, hitting 
her thumb when she tried to hang 
his pictures in the study. 

Vera . . . 

He prowled dissatisfiedly 
through the house, as though in 
search of something, and then went 
out to the car. He took the superpike almost all the way to the Center. There were bright cards on 
posts every few hundred feet: 

IT'S NOT TOO LATE 
TO GET A MATE 
THE GIRLS ARE GREAT 
AT THE DOMESTIC CENTER 

He pulled into the sweeping circular drive at the huge group of 



MADE TO MEASURE 



125 



buildings. A troupe of singing girls 
came out, dressed in majorette costumes, opened the door, helped him 
out, parked the car, escorted him 
into the lavish reception room. Music came from somewhere, soft and 
moody. There were murals all over 
the walls, every one romantic. A 
dispensing machine held engagement and wedding rings with a 
series of finger-holes on the left 
side for matching sizes. 

THE matron recognized him and 
said, "Mr. Tullgren has gone 
home for the day. Is there anything 
I can do?" 

He told her what he wanted 
and she thumbed through a register. 

"Yes, she's still here," the matron said finally. "She's refused 
exactly thirty-two offers up to yesterday. You were thinking of a — 
reconciliation ?" 

Joe nodded with a new 
humility. "If she'll have me." 

The matron smiled. "I think she 
will. Women are more understanding than men, usually. More romantic, you might say." 

Nine-tenths of the building was 
brightly lighted, one-tenth rather 
dim. In the dim tenth were the 
post-intent rooms, the reconciliation 
chambers. 

Joe sat on a yellow love-seat in 
one of the empty reconciliation 
chambers, leafing through, but not 
seeing, a copy of a fashion magazine. Then there were steps in the 



hall, familiar steps, and he smelled 
the perfume before she came in. 

She stood timidly at the archway, but Joe was even more unsure 
and, weak in the legs and he had 
trouble with his breathing. 

"Joe," Vera said. 

"Vera," he answered. 

It wasn't much, but it seemed 
to be what both had in mind. 

"Was there something you wanted to tell me?" she asked. "Something important?" 

"It's important to me, Vera," he 
said humbly. "I hope it's just as 
important to you." 

She looked brightly at him. 

"I find it very difficult to put 
into words," he stumbled. "The 
usual expressions of this emotion 
are so hackneyed. I would like to 
find some other way to say it." 

"Say what?" 

"That I love you." 

She ran to him. The impact 
knocked the breath out of both of 
them, but neither noticed. 

"Isn't the old phrase good 
enough, silly?" she scolded and 
kissed him. "I love you too, lover 
baby." 

Behind them, at the key words, 
the sonic-signal closed the hidden 
doors in the archway and they 
were alone in the reconciliation 
chamber. 

Joe discovered that Sam Tullgren, Director of the Domestic 
Center, had thought of everything 
to make reconciliations complete.

Susceptibility 

By JOHN D. McDONALD 



SEAN MALLOY stood unnoticed at the edge of the clearing and frowned as he 
watched the girl work. Exposure to 
the rays of the yellow-white sun, 
half again the size of Sol, had 
turned her to copper bronze, 
against which the mane of yellow 
hair was cjuite startling. He found 
that he was taking pleasure in 
watching the smooth play of 
muscles in her naked back as she 
swung the instrument against the 
tree. Each stroke bit out a chunk 



of the soft yellowish wood, veined 
with green. Exertion had put a 
sheen of perspiration on her shoulders. 

The proper paleolingual word 
eluded him. Suddenly he remembered. Of course — it was an ax. 

The sound of it, biting into the 
wood, resounded across the clearing, a sharp, metronomic sound. 
He heard the crackle of fibers and 
saw her step back from the tree. 
Sean Malloy glanced up then, and 
saw the great mass of branches and

was as if they had deliberately decided to set their 
civilization back to some harsh era out of the past!

leaves sway toward him. He gave 
a gasp of alarm, and forgetting all 
the dignity of a Praecursor from 
the Colonial Adjustments Bureau, 
he ran at right angles to the line of 
fall. After fifty feet of surprising 
fleetness, he struck a hummock of 
grass and fell just at the moment 
the tree thundered to the ground, 
so close behind him that the end 
of a branch rapped him smartly 
across the shoulders. He crawled 
out from under the leaves and 
stood up. The tall woman was 
hurrying toward him, buttoning on 
a shirt of coarse fabric, quick concern in her eyes. 

"You're not hurt?" 

"It so happens that I'm not," he 
said acidly. 

He saw her glance take in his 
uniform, the CAB seal, the tiny 
gold question mark of the Praecursor blazoned upon it. She no 
longer looked concerned. 

"People who wait for trees to 
fall on them generally get hurt," 
she said indifferently. 

"I am Sean Malloy, Praecursor. 
They told me, in the village, that I 
should talk to you. You are Deen 
Thomason ?" 

She nodded. She looked regretfully at the tree. "I suppose I can 
just as well finish it tomorrow. 
Come along, Malloy." 

She shouldered the ax and headed across the clearing to the mouth 
of a narrow trail. Her stride was 
long. Once again Malloy found 
himself taking a rather surprising 



pleasure in watching her. He made 
a mental note to apply, on his return to the Bureau, for deep psychological analysis. Praecursors who 
became emotionally involved with 
colonial women suffered a loss of 
efficiency. It would be wise to have 
this susceptibility tracked down and 
eliminated. In the meantime, to 
take his attention away from the 
swing of her walk, he asked hastily, 
"What were you planning to do 
with the tree, Thomason?" 

"Cut off the branches today, saw 
it tomorrow, then split it and carry 
the pieces back to my place." 

"But why?" he asked, baffled. 

SHE stopped so suddenly that he' 
almost ran into her. She turnedaround and he saw a mixture of 
amusement and irony in her grayeyes. ' • 

"Our winter season is coming, 
Malloy," she said. "I burn the 
wood in order to keep warm." 

She was almost as tall as he. He 
said, as though reasoning with a 
child, "Wouldn't it be much simpler to ask for a heat unit? There's 
a field station here, an unlimited 
power source. All you have to do 
is . . ." 

"Of course, Malloy. It just so 
happens that I'd rather do it this 
way." 

"But . . ." 

She had turned again and was 
striding along the trail. He had to 
trot to catch up with her. They 
emerged into a second clearing. A 



128 




 



crude wooden house sat at the base 
of a hill, and he was forced to admit that the setting, with the small 
busy stream foaming through the 
rocky channel, was superb. Primitive, though. 

He followed her to the door of 
the house. It was open. 

"Where is your mate?" he asked, 
realizing too late that his choice of 
words had been a bit hasty. It was 
undiplomatic to point out the backwardness of this unfortunate social 
order without shrewd preparation. 

She looked more amused than 
angered. "Sit down, Malloy. I have 
not yet mated, if that's what you 
Bureau people prefer to call it." 

"You built this house yourself?" 

"No. I selected the spot. All the 
others helped me. It was built in 
two days. The Bureau would have 
been horrified. Everyone working 
with their hands. Dancing and 
food that didn't come from the 
field station and a strong brew 
made from fruits. Very barbaric." 

He sat at a bench beside a 
wooden table. She lifted a trap 
door, went down steps and returned 
with a corked earthenware -jug. She 
poured a cup of water and handed 
it to him. The day was warm, the 
water cool and sweet. 

"Thank you," he said. She sat 
opposite him. 

He smiled officially. "Well, shall 
we get to it, Thomason ? It took me 
a long time to find you. And I 
didn't expect anyone like you to 
be . . . head of the planet." 

130 



"Let us be accurate, Malloy. This' 
year it happened to be my turn to 
represent the village at general 
meeting, and also the turn of my 
village to supply the chairman for 
the meeting." 

MALLOY gave her a pained 
look. "My dear young woman, my duty involves contacting 
the person in charge here. Are you 
or are you not in charge?" 

"If you could say anyone is in 
charge, I suppose I am." 

"Then you keep the records, I 
gather. Issue orders. Take care of 
administration." 

"There are no records to keep, 
Malloy. I issued one order, I think. 
I set the day of the next meeting. 
And the villages administer themselves." 

Malloy stood up, walked to the 
stone fireplace, turned abruptly. 
"Please, Thomason. A Praecursor 
named Zedder was sent here to 
Able XII seven Earth years ago, 
five and a half of your years. His 
job was to find out why the field 
station was almost unutilized, why 
there were no entertainment imports, why you were canceled off 
the tour schedules for lack of business. Zedder came here and put his 
ship on homing automatic with his 
resignation fastened to the flight 
panel. That was so unusual that 
Able XII was put on emergency 
priority. Our press of business is so 
great that this is the first time you 
have had Bureau contact since then. 


 



"I came here expecting to find 
most of the population gone. At 
first I thought I was right. No one 
seems to live at the Centers the 
Bureau built for you people. Then 
I found you of Able XII living out 
here in these crude villages and 
shacks. It has taken me two full 
weeks to locate you, Thomason. 
I'm a busy man. A very busy man. 
The field station is in perfect working order. I've tested it. I projected 
a perfectly satisfactory little flier, 
synthesized foods at random from 
the list that checked perfectly, even 
used the tele-tubes from Center to 
Center. My job is to find out what's 
wrong here, Thomason." 

"Does something have to be 
wrong?" she demanded. 

"Don't try my patience, Thomason." 

Her gray eyes narrowed a bit. "I 
can think of very few things I'm 
more indifferent to, Malloy, than 
your patience or lack of patience. 
This is my home. You have all the 
normal privileges of a guest. An 
autocratic attitude is not one of 
those privileges." 

He sat down wearily. "I'm sorry. 
It's just that I'm upset. Where's 
Zedder?" 

"I'm sure I haven't the faintest 
idea." 

"Isn't there any central record 
of population? Any index?" 

"We don't find that necessary, 
Malloy." 

"I can't spare the time to hunt 
in every village for him. I've got 



four more emergency priority cases 
to cover in other parts of the 
Galaxy." 

"Then why don't you just get 
back into whatever you came here 
in and go take care of them?" 

HE LIFTED his chin. "When 
the Colonial Bureau sets up 
proper resident facilities on a planet 
and stocks the planet with colonists, and when said colonists fail 
to use the facilities provided, it is 
the duty of the Colonial Adjustments Bureau to send a Praecursor 
to make investigation and recommendation as to what sort of adjustment team should be sent to 
rectify said non-utilization of 
standard facilities." 

She looked amused. "I assume 
you're quoting from some sort of 
absurd manual, Malloy. Does it actually use the word 'stock' ? As with 
fish in a pond?" 

"There is a case on record where 
one colonial planet suffered such an 
emotional degeneration that the 
colonists acquired a superstitious 
fear of Center facilities and moved 
off into the woods." 

"And they were adjusted?" Deen 
Thomason asked mildly. 

"Re-educated," Malloy amended. 
"That sounds dreadful. Just report, Praecursor, that the inhabitants of Able XII prefer a so-called 
primitive life, and that the facilities of the Centers and the field 
station are used when emergencies 
arise." 



SUSCEPTIBILITY 



131 



"That will make no sense to the 
Bureau," he said hotly. "You people live out here in absolute 
squalor. All the Center homes are 
empty. Insects have gotten in. Of 
course they can do no damage, but 
they have spun webs on the projector dials. It's untidy, a criminal 
waste. You could move to a Center. Everything you could possibly 
desire would be no farther from 
your hand than the nearest dial. It 
is incomprehensible to me, Thomason, that you should prefer to 
walk back into the earliest history 
of your race. Every possible comfort 
was made available when this colonial planet was set up for . . ." 

She raised her hand. "Please, 
Malloy. Stand up a moment." 

He stood up, puzzled. She 
walked around the table, smiled 
enigmatically at him and suddenly, 
clenching her fist, she struck him 
hard in the diaphragm. He had 
just enough warning so that he was 
able to tense his muscles against the 
blow. Even so, it almost took his 
breath. 

"To strike a Praecursor is . . ." 

"Oh, stop being so stuffy! Why 
are you a Praecursor? Why are you 
reasonably lean and hard and fit? 
Why aren't you sitting plump and 
happy within arm's reach of a dial 
on your home planet?" 

He stared at her. "Why, I . . . 
there have to be Praecursors !" 

"That point is debatable. But 
I'm asking why you are one." 

"I like problems and new places, 



I suppose," he said hesitantly. 
"And I have to keep fit because 
sometimes I run into . . . strenuous 
situations. But no one forced me 
to be a Praecursor." 

"Exactly," she said. 

"I hope you realize that you are 
not making sense, Thomason." 

"Indeed? I thought I was making a great deal of sense. Anyway, 
you can report that we are not completely lost. One of the Centers is 
occupied, you know." 

"Is it? Good! Which one?" 

"Number Six. I'd like to visit it 
with you. I have a reason, Malloy." 

He pressed the stud on his time 
ring and the correct sun time of the 
Able XII twenty-hour day came 
into his mind. He knew that she 
was standing near enough to him 
so that she caught it, too, though 
less strongly. She chuckled, and it 
was a surprisingly warm sound. 

"Why are you laughing?" he 
asked. 

"That toy. See the sun pattern 
on the floor? From that I could 
have told you the time within a 
half hour." 

"Not much of a degree of accuracy." 

<< A GAIN you've missed the 
XX point, Malloy. It's accurate 
enough." 

"I can't argue with unreason. 
Come on. That flier I projected is 
beyond the clearing where I found 
you. I'll leave it with you when I 

g°-" 



132 




 



"Thank you. I'd have no use for 
it. And we should eat before we 
go-" 

"We'll eat at the Center." 

"Thank you, no. I'll get us something here. First, though, I must 
bathe." 

He looked around the room. "No 
cleansing unit here." 

"There's a perfectly good one in 
the stream, Malloy." She went to 
the shelves near the fireplace, selected a tunic of softer fabric than 
her work clothes, and a heavy 
towel. "You can make yourself useful, Malloy. Build a small fire in 
the fireplace. But first come here a 
moment. That's my garden. See 
those spiky green things? Pull up 
about a dozen of them and wash 
them in the stream." 

Before he could decide whether 
or not to refuse the request, she 
had gone, walking toward the 
stream with that long stride of hers, 
supple and somehow wild. He selected small sticks and tried with 
infuriating lack of success to start 
them burning by using a short hot 
focus of his pocket heat unit. Angry 
at failing in so simple a task, he 
walked out and yanked up a dozen 
of the growths she had indicated. 
Black moist soil clung to the bulbular white ends that came out of 
the ground. 

He took them to the stream, below the wider part that formed a 
pool. Remembering the extreme 
variations in attitudes of modesty 
on the colonial planets, he did not 



wish to look directly at her. Precursors were trained to adapt themselves readily to many odd folkways. But in spite of his intentions 
he found himself gawking at her as 
she stood by the pool, tall and 
tanned and lithe. She smiled down 
the slope at him as she toweled her 
shining hair and he made a comparison oddly damaging to the soft 
pallid women of home. 

She belted the short aqua tunic 
around her slim waist and he followed her back to the house. As 
he watched her she put some dried 
moss under the sticks in the fireplace, scratched an object which he 
recognized as being one of the 
crude nremaking devices of earliest 
times. It was called, he remembered, 
a "match." The small fire blazed. 
She brought ovoid white objects 
from the cellar, cracked them into 
an earthenware dish, chopped the 
bulbous white growths with a 
crude knife and stirred them into 
the mixture. The dish was then suspended over the flame while she 
sawed off heavy slabs of coarse 
bread, spread them with a yellow 
substance. 

MALLOY watched closely. This 
primitive substitute for the 
extremely simple procedure of operating the synthesizer would form 
an interesting portion of his report. 
The odor that filled the room, however, made his salivary glands surprisingly active. The mixture firmed 
and she took the dish from over 



SUSCEPTIBILITY 



133 



the fire, divided the contents into 
two parts, placed one part between 
two heavy slabs of bread and put 
it on another dish, set it in front 
of him. 

Malloy took a cautious bite and 
then a much larger one. The taste 
was harsher and more concentrated, 
the texture far coarser than any 
food he had ever tasted before. 

Before he knew it, his share was 
gone. She washed the dishes in the 
stream and replaced them on the 
shelf. 

"That was very interesting," he 
said. 

"But nothing you'd care for day 
in and day out?" 

"N-no," he said. 

She smiled. "I'm ready, Malloy. 
Shall we go?" 

They walked to the small flier. 
Malloy watched her closely. She 
had no awe of it, accepted it as 
something routine and unimpressive. He ducked under the low 
door, sat down beside her, lifted 
the flier off the ground, swung 
around the crest of a clump of trees. 

"Let me see," he said, "six would 
be . . ." 

"Turn it a bit to your right, 
Malloy. That's enough." 

Air whined by as he upped the 
speed. Cabin heat increased and the 
cooling unit came on. The ground 
streamed by far below, flattened by 
the height. 

He said, in a fatherly tone, "This 
would be a long trip afoot, the way 
you people seem to travel." 



"Several days, Malloy. Through 
country where pine woods cover the 
hills, where silvery fish leap high 
in the lakes, where the trees hold 
wild honey. At dusk you come to a 
village. You are always made welcome. Cheese and bread and wine 
and dancing in the dusk, and the 
fireflies are like little lanterns." 

"Oh," he said distantly. 

"But your way is, of course, much 
quicker," she added. 

"I see the Center," he said. 

HE BROUGHT the flier around 
in a long swooping curve and 
dropped it lightly onto cleared land 
outside the gates. Even as he got 
out he saw people walking in the 
wide pastel streets of the Center. 
It was like a scene from home. They 
wore clothes of all shades, hues, 
fancies, whims. A completely anachronistic shack stood outside the 
gate, though. A tall young man 
with a full blond beard sat with his 
back against the door frame. He 
grinned and stood up as Malloy 
and Deen approached. He wore the 
crude garments of the villagers. 
"Thomason, isn't it?" he asked. 
"That's right. This is just an inspection trip." 

"Go right ahead," he said. 
He turned to a metallic plate set 
beside the rude door, depressed a 
switch. Malloy, slightly baffled, 
followed Deen through the gate. 
As he passed through he felt the 
momentary tingle of a space-twist 
fence temporarily reversed. 



134 




 



Then he straightened his shoulders. He walked beside Thomason. 
"You see how pleasant life can be 
in a Center?" he asked proudly. 

A well-larded woman sat in the 
sun playing with two romping fuzzy 
creatures she had created out of the 
mental projector. Beyond her a man 
slept propped against a wall, halfempty bottles surrounding him. 

"Very pleasant," Thomason said. 

"They all have everything they 
want. Who would want to live out 
in the brush when everything is 
right here, within arm's reach? Exotic foods, toys, amusement." 

"Who indeed?" Thomason 
stressed with gentle irony. 
. Malloy beamed at the colonists. 
They had the familiar triple chins 
of the home planet, the same shortness of breath, the same bland look 
that comes of satiety in all things. 
But he was puzzled by the way they 
stared at the two of them. Dulled 
eyes, with the glow of resentment 
almost submerged. 

At the end of the street he 
stopped. "But the rest of the Center is empty!" he said. 

"Yes. There's just this one 
street. We can't go any farther. 
The fence will stop us." 

She turned and started back. He 
caught her in two quick strides, 
grasped her arm and pulled her 
around roughly. "Why have you 
people installed a twist fence 
around this street?" 

"Because there's no need to put 
it around a bigger area." 



"Why put it around any area?" 
he shouted into her face. 

"You are rude," she said coldly. 
"And more stupid than I thought. 
We'll walk back slowly. Look at 
their faces, JVIalloy. Look long and 
well. You see, this is the penal 
colony for this planet." 

The breath whoofed out of him. • 
"Penal? But . . . Wait. Anybody 
who lives here can have every last 
thing they want." 

"Exactly," she said. 

Subdued, he walked beside her 
and he looked at their faces. 

IT WAS dusk in the heart of the 
village. He heard the thin eager 
voices of children at play. Smoke 
from the cook fires lost itself in 
the grayness overhead where the 
first strange star patterns were beginning to appear. Deen sat with 
her -back against a tree. Sean Malloy lay stretched out on the grass 
on his back, the concavity of the 
nape of his neck fitting comfortably 
over the warm convexity of her 
thigh. 

An insect lit on the back of his 
hand and he slapped it. He 
squirmed a 'bit. He wasn't yet accustomed to the scratchiness of 
homespun clothes. He squinted up 
at the skies and thought of his ship 
speeding toward Bureau headquarters, the resignation affixed to the 
automatic controls. This was the 
third night back at her home. 

"A crazy thing to do," he muttered. 



SUSCEPTIBILITY 



135 



She took her cool fingertips from 
his forehead abruptly. "Sorry you 
did it, Sean?" she asked a bit frigidly. 

He captured her hand, kissed the 
palm. "Not the way it sounded. My 
ship will get back there. They'll 
give Able XII a double priority. A 
new Praecursor will be here in 
probably less than four years. He 
may send an adjustment team." 

The children were being called 
in from play. A few hundred feet 
down the unpaved main street 
came' the -first tentative sounds of 
music. 

"I wouldn't worry about that, 
Sean," she said softly. 

He sat up, faced her. "Why in 
Sol not?" 

She smiled at him. "Because 
when he comes, he'll go looking 
for the person in charge, won't 
he?" 

"Naturally." 

"It was decided a long time ago 
that what little centralized administration we need should be handled by those of us least likely to 
be hungry for that sort of power." 

"I don't get the connection." 

"Village representatives to the 
general meeting are always unmarried girls, and are always those considered to be the most pleasing to 
the eye. And we are beginning to 



find that anyone who has become a 
Praecursor seems peculiarly . . . 
susceptible to this sort of existence." 

HE WAS silent for a long time, 
and then he laughed. "Poor 
Zedder," he said. 

"And poor Malloy," she added 
teasingly. 

Suddenly he became suspicious. 
"Did you have orders to — to — " 

"Seduce the Praecursor? How 
strangely short your memory is, my 
Sean! I seem to remember that the 
shoe was on the other foot." She 
stood up quickly and held out her 
hand. "Come. They will expect us 
to dance. I shall teach you. It will 
make you hungry for the wedding 
feast." 

"How barbaric!" muttered the 
ex-Praecursor as he urgently uptilted her mouth. 

"How primitive you're becoming!" she taunted, and writhed out 
of his arms. 

He caught her finally, but only 
because she let him. He needed 
some woodchopping and farming, 
maybe some hunting and hiking, 
too, before he could outrun her 
legitimately. A couple of months 
and she would see who was the 
stronger.

BY GROFF CONKLIN 



T HE pickings are slim this 
month. Three books, one of 
them not science fiction and 
another a minor effort by a major 
author, make up our quota. 

The book which, despite its 
various faults, stacks up as a worthwhile addition to one's science fiction collection is Stanton A. Coblentz's After 12,000 Years {Fantasy Publishing Co., Inc., 295 
pages, $3.00). It comes as a surprise to find myself enjoying this 
book, for I have heretofore found 
Coblentz's tales almost painfully 
gauche and sententious in style and 
idea. 



It is true that the present opus 
is no masterpiece of vari-colored 
writing, and that its romantic elements are handled with all the sensitiveness of the Sweet Singer of 
Michigan. But if you pass up these 
defects, you will find it one of the 
most interesting and believable 
anti-Utopias of recent decades. 

The book was first published, according to the copyright notice, in 
1928; in many ways it sounds much 
older. For example, Coblentz's description of aircraft is more like 
Jules Verne than what has come 
since the Wright brothers. Yet the 
ideas in the book are valid — more 



★ ★★★★ SHELF 



137 



so today, I believe, than when the 
book was written. Coblentz conceives of a world in which the class 
society has been frozen rigid by 
ruthless selective breeding and 
genetic manipulation. 

By the time the story takes place, 
14101 A.D., the people of the 
world are differentiated into the 
Political-Financial species or "Wolf 
Faces" — politicians, dictators, slaveowners, the elite of the society; the 
Intellectuals, or "Large Heads;" and 
the "Small Heads," subdivided into 
Workers and Soldiers. In addition 
there is a remnant of normal human beings occupying caves on the 
island of Borneo, defending themselves as best they can against Wolf 
Face hunting bands. 

The peoples of organized society 
(but not the Borneans) are kept 
under control by automatic propaganda reminiscent of that in George 
Orwell's 1984, and also of the 
Nazis' own "Big Lie" technique — 
a remarkable prevision of Hitlerism by Coblentz. 

The hero of the story is from our 
times, and survives 12,000 years as 
the result of a faulty experiment 
with suspended animation. He is 
much like the Borneans in appearance; and, like them, when they are 
captured, he is enslaved, forced to 
become a "Keeper of the Insects," 
a frightful job. 

The insects he tends comprise the 
armies of the empires of the world, 
Panamica, A-Uria, and Afalia, of 
which the most aggressive is the 



"Financial Democracy" of Panamica, by whose soldiery the hero of 
the story was captured. The armies 
of insects, bred for enormous size, 
vicious temper and specialized activity (they include wasps, bees, soldier ants, locusts and such) are 
tended by Bornean slaves and by 
Small Head Workers. 

After adventures including a 
jello-like affair with a Bornean girl 
named Luellen, the hero is transferred to the Panamican army, 
given a mission to spread termites 
over A-Uria.from an airship, captured by the enemy and set to work 
as a farmer. However, before anything drastic can happen to him, the 
whole civilization is wiped out by 
termites, which turn on their masters and consume every bit of food 
left in the world — including the 
starved corpses of the people. All of 
the world is theirs except for 
Borneo, to which the hero and his 
Bornean beloved escape. 

Make no mistake — this is not one 
of science fiction's works of 
genius. But it is fresh and full of 
uncomfortable ideas about the future. 

THE other science fiction item on 
our list this month is A. E. van 
Vogt's The House That Stood Still 
{Greenberg: Publisher, 210 pages, 
$2.50). This is a potboiler that develops no head of steam — a routine 
attempt at a detective story of the 
frenetic "West Coast" school, forced 
into a science fiction mold by in


138 




 



serting "Immortals" and their 
never-changing house (built around 
the spaceship of a prehistoric visitor 
to Earth) which keeps them immortal. 

The story, with its various dreary 
murders, revolves around the struggles between two factions of the 
Immortals, one of which wants to 
quit Earth in the spaceship and go 
to Mars before Earth's inevitable 
atomic war blasts them to bits, and 
the few — including the bee-youtiful heroine — who want to stay and 
try to stop the war with their superhuman powers. 

Allison Stephens, estate agent 
for the richest of the Immortals, is 
an Erie Stanley Gardner type of 
hero. At the end of 7 out of 23 
chapters, he is knocked out, held 
up, or in other ways pushed around 
the landscape to make him stop interfering. 

Of course, he wins out in the 
end, getting the heroine, fame, 
gold, immortality in one big, delicious economy package. 

The book is readable, no question about it. But in science fiction 
more is needed, as van Vogt's other 
works brilliantly show. Ideas, imagination, scope — these things, essential in good science fiction, this 
book has in minimal quantities. I 
would class it as a rental library 
property. 

THE month's third book is 
pseudo-historical romance, with 
a tablespoonful of (black magic and 



diabolism. It is of the same genre 
as E. R. Eddison's The Worm Ouroboros, (which of course surpasses 
our current item). Even so, Robert 
E. Howard's Conan The Conqueror 
{Gnome Press, Inc., 255 pages, 
$2.75, originally published under 
the title The Hour of the Dragon 
in one of the 1935 pulps) is a colorful action story, in many ways a 
delightful piece of relaxation reading. 

Much of the action in the story, 
which takes place in semi-mythical 
places and times, concerns the conspiracies of Xaltotun, a sorcerer 
3,000 years dead, revived for purposes of the plot by a clique of 
empire-seekers who use the rediscovered "Heart of Ahriman" as 
their revivifying instrument. Conan, 
a king against whom the others conspire, is a believable and fullbodied character; one could wish 
that Howard had done more with 
him and less with his villains and 
black magics. 

As a straight creation of the 
imagination, the world of Conan 
and his co-players on their swashbuckling stage has real merit. As a 
piece of writing it is only average, 
being pretty well laden with bombast. As supernatural literature it 
is faintly ridiculous. 

Nevertheless, for those who 
like to lean back and read with 
their minds closed, Conan will be 
highly acceptable and enjoyable.

The Reluctant 




Pioneers have always resented their wanderlust, hated 
their hardships. But the future brings a new grudge — 
when pioneers stay put and scholars do the exploring! 




By FRANK M. ROBINSON 



rHE very young man sat on 
the edge of the sofa and 
looked nervous. He carefully studied his fingernails and ran 
his hands through his hair and 
picked imaginary lint off the upholstery. 

"I have a chance to go with the 
first research expedition to Venus," 
he said. 

The older man studied the very 
young man thoughtfully and then 
leaned over to his humidor and 
offered him a cigaret. "It's nice to 
have the new air units now. There 
was a time when we had to be very 
careful about things like smoking." 



The verv young man was annoyed. 

"I don't think I want to go," he 
blurted. "I don't think I would care 
to spend two years there." 

The older man blew a smoke 
ring and watched it drift toward 
the air exhaust vent. 

"You mean you would miss it 
here, the people you've known and 
grown up with, the little familiar 
things that have made up your life 
here. You're afraid the glamor 
would wear off and you would get 
to hate it on Venus." 

The very young man nodded 
miserably. "1 guess that's it."

"Anything else?" 

The very young man found his 
fingernails extremely fascinating 
again and finally said, in a low 
voice, "Yes, there is." 

"A girl?" 

A nod confirmed this. 

It was the older man's turn to 
look thoughtful. "You know, I'm 
sure, that psychologists and research 
men agree that research stations 
should be staffed by couples. That 
is, of course, as soon as it's practical." 

"But that might be a long time!" 
the very young man protested. 
"It might be — but sometimes it's 



sooner than you think. And the 
goal is worth it." 

"I suppose so, but — " 

The older man smiled. "Still the 
reluctant heroes," he said, somewhat to himself.

give him a bonus, the every-manhas-his-price idea. They probably 
thought he liked it there. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



141 



Oh, sure, he loved it. Canned 
coffee, canned beans, canned pills, 
and canned air until your insides 
felt as though they were plated 
with tin. Life in a cramped, smelly 
little hut where you could take only 
ten steps in any one direction. 
Their little scientific home of tomorrow with none of the modern 
conveniences, a charming place 
where you couldn't take a shower, 
couldn't brush your teeth, and your 
kidneys didn't work right. 

And for double his salary they 
thought he'd be glad to stay for another year and a half. Or maybe 
three. He should probably be glad 
he had the opportunity. 

The key started to stutter again, 
demanding an answer. 

He tapped out his reply: "No!" 

There was a silence and then the 
key stammered once more in a sudden fit of bureaucratic rage. Chapman stuffed a rag under it and ignored it. He turned to the hammocks, strung against the bulkhead 
on the other side of the room. 

The chattering of the key hadn't 
awakened anybody; they were still 
asleep, making the animal noises 
that people usually make in slumber. Dowden, half in the bottom 
hammock and half on the floor, was 
snoring peacefully. Dahl, the poor 
kid who was due for stopover, was 
mumbling to himself. Julius Klein, 
with that look of ineffable happiness on his face, looked as if he had 
just squirmed under the tent to his 
personal idea of heaven. Donley 



and Bening were lying perfectly 
still, their covers not mussed, sleeping very lightly. 

Lord, Chapman thought, I'll be 
happy when I can see some other 
faces. 

"What'd they want?" Klein had 
one eyelid open and a questioning 
look on his face. 

"They wanted me to stay until 
the next relief ship lands," Chapman whispered back. 

"What did you say?" 

He shrugged. "No." 

"You kept it short," somebody 
else whispered. It was Donley, up 
and sitting on the side of his hammock. "If it had been me, I would 
have told them just what they could 
do about it." 

THE others were awake now, 
with the exception of Dahl who 
had his face to the bulkhead and a 
pillow over his head. 

Dowden rubbed his eyes sleepily. "Sore, aren't you?" 

"Kind of. Who wouldn't be?" 
"Well, don't let it throw you. 
They've never been here on the 
Moon. They don't know what it's 
like. All they're trying to do is get 
a good man to stay on the job a 
while longer." 

"All they're trying to do," Chapman said sarcastically. "They've got 
a fat chance." 

"They think you've found a 
home here," Donley said. 

"Why the hell don't you guys 
shut up until morning?" Dahl was 



142 




 



awake, looking bitter. "Some of us 
still have to stay here, you know. 
Some of us aren't going back today." 

No, Chapman thought, some of 
us aren't going back. You aren't. 
And Dixon's staying, too. Only 
Dixon isn't ever going back. 

Klein jerked his thumb toward 
Dahl's bunk, held a finger to his 
lips, and walked noiselessly over to 
the small electric stove. It was his 
day for breakfast duty. 

The others started lacing up their 
bunks, getting ready for their last 
day of work on the Moon. In a few 
hours they'd be relieved by members of the Third research group 
and they'd be on their way back to 
Earth. 

And that includes me, Chapman 
thought. I'm going home. I'm 
finally going home. 

He walked silently to the one 
small, quartz window in the room. 
It was morning — the Moon's 
"morning" — and he shivered 
slightly. The rays of the Sun were 
just striking the far rim of the 
crater and long shadows shot across 
the crater floor. The rest of it was 
still blanketed in a dark jumble of 
powdery pumice and jagged peaks 
that would make the Black Hills of 
Dakota look like paradise. 

A hundred yards from the research bunker he could make out 
the small mound of stones and the 
forlorn homemade cross, juryrigged out of small condensed milk 
tins slid over crossed iron bars. You 



could still see the footprints in the 
powdery soil where the group had 
gathered about the grave. It had 
been more than eighteen months 
ago, but there was no wind to wear 
those tracks away. They'd be there 
forever. 

That's what happened to guys 
like Dixon, Chapman thought. On 
the Moon, one mistake could use 
up your whole quota of chances. 

Klein came back with the coffee. 
Chapman took a cup, gagged, and 
forced himself to swallow the rest 
of it. It had been in the can for so 
long you could almost taste the 
glue on the label. 

DONLEY was warming himself 
over his cup, looking thoughtful. Dowden and Bening were 
struggling into their suits, getting 
ready to go outside. Dahl was still 
sitting on his hammock, trying to 
ignore them. 

"Think we ought to radio the 
space station and see if they've left 
there yet?" Klein asked. 

"I talked to them on the last 
call," Chapman said. "The relief 
ship left there twelve hours ago. 
They should get here"- — he looked 
at his watch — "in about six and a 
half hours." 

"Chap, you know, I've been 
thinking," Donley said quietly. 
"You've been here just twice as 
long as the rest of us. What's the 
first thing you're going to do once 
you get back?" 

It hit them, then. Dowden and 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



143 



Bening looked blank for a minute 
and blindly found packing cases 
to sit on. The top halves of their 
suits were still hanging on the bulkhead. Klein lowered his coffee cup 
and looked grave. Even Dahl 
glanced up expectantly. 

"I don't know," Chapman said 
slowly. "I guess I was trying not to 
think of that. I suppose none of us 
have. We've been like little kids 
who have waited so long for Christmas that they just can't believe it 
when it's finally Christmas Eve." 

Klein nodded in agreement. "I 
haven't been here three years like 
you have, but I think I know what 
you mean." He warmed up to it as 
the idea sank in. "Just what the 
hell are you going to do?" 

"Nothing very spectacular," 
Chapman said, smiling. "I'm going 



to rent a room over Times Square, 
get a recording of a rikky-tik piano, 
and drink and listen to the music 
and watch the people on the street 
below. Then I think I'll see somebody." 

"Who's the somebody?" Donley 
asked. 

Chapman grinned. "Oh, just 
somebody. What are you going to 
do, Dick?" 

"Well, I'm going to do something practical. First of all, I want 
to turn over all my geological samples to the government. Then I'm 
going to sell my life story to the 
movies and then — why, then, I 
think I'll get drunk!" 

Everybody laughed and Chapman turned to Klein. 

"How about you, Julius?" 

Klein looked solemn. "Like 



144 




 



Dick, I'll first get rid of my obligations to the expedition. Then I 
think I'll go home and see my 
wife." 

They were quiet. "I thought all 
members of the groups were supposed to be single," Donley said. 

"They are. And I can see their 
reasons for it. But who could pass 
up the money the Commission was 
paying?" 

"If I had to do it all over again ? 
Me," said Donley promptly. 

They laughed. Somebody said: 
"Go play your record, Chap. Today's the day for it." 

The phonograph was a small, 
wind-up model that Chapman had 
smuggled in when he had landed 
with the First group. The record 
was old and the shellac was nearly 
worn off, but the music was good. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



The roads are the dustiest, 
The winds are the gustiest 
The gates are the rustiest, 
The pies are the crustiest, 
The songs are the lustiest, 
The friends the trustiest, 
Way back home* 

THEY ran through it twice. 
They were beginning to feel it 
now, Chapman thought. They were 
going to go home in a little while 
and the idea was just starting to 
sink in. 

"You know, Chap," Donley said, 
"it won't seem like the same old 
Moon without you on it. Why, 
we'll look at it when we're out 
spooning or something and it just 
won't have the same old appeal." 

"Like they say in the army," 
Bening said, "you never had it so 
good. You found a home here." 

The others chimed in and Chapman grinned. Yesterday or a week 
ago they couldn't have done it. He 
had been there too long and he had 
hated it too much. 

The party quieted down after a 
while and Dowden and Bening finished getting into their suits. They 
still had a section of the sky to map 
before they left. Donley was right 
after them. There was an outcropping of rock that he wanted a sample of and some strata he wished to 
investigate. 

And the time went faster when 
you kept busy.

Chapman stopped them at the 
lock. "Remember to check your 
suits for leaks," he warned. "And 
check the valves of your oxygen 
tanks." 

Donley looked sour. "I've gone 
out at least five hundred times," he 
said, "and you check me each time." 

"And I'd check you five hundred more," -Chapman said. "It 
takes only one mistake. And watch 
out for blisters under the pumice 
crust. You go through one of those 
and that's it, brother." 

Donley sighed. "Chap, you watch 
us like an old mother hen. You see 
we check our suits, you settle our 
arguments, you see that we're not 
bored and that we stay healthy and 
happy. I think you'd blow our noses 
for us if we caught cold. But some 
day, Chap old man, you're gonna 
find out that your little boys can 
watch out for themselves!" 

But he checked his suit for leaks 
and tested the valve of his tank 
before he left. 

Only Klein and Chapman were 
left in the bunker. Klein was at the 
work table, carefully labeling some 
lichen specimens. 

"I never knew you were married," Chapman said. 

Klein didn't look up. "There 
wasn't much sense in talking about 
it. You just get to thinking and 
wanting — and there's nothing you 
can do about it. You talk about it 
and it just makes it worse." 

"She let you go without any fuss, 
huh?" 



146 




 



"No, she didn't make any fuss. 
But I don't think she liked to see 
me go, either." He laughed a little. 
"At least I hope she didn't." 

THEY were silent for a while. 
"What do you miss most, 
Chap?" Klein asked. "Oh, I know 
what we said a little while ago, but 
I mean seriously." 

Chapman thought a minute. "I 
think I miss the sky," he said quietly. "The blue sky and the green 
grass and trees with leaves on them 
that turn color in the Fall. I think, 
when I go back, that I'd like to go 
out in a rain storm and strip and 
feel the rain on my skin." 

He stopped, feeling embarrassed. 
Klein's expression was encouraging. "And then I think I'd like to 
go downtown and just watch the 
shoppers on the sidewalks. Or maybe go to a burlesque house and 
smell the cheap perfume and the 
popcorn and the people sweating in 
the dark." 

He studied his hands. "I think 
what I miss most is people — all 
kinds of people. Bad people and 
good people and fat people and 
thin people, and people I can't understand. People who wouldn't 
know an atom from an artichoke. 
And people who wouldn't give a 
damn. We're a quarter of a million 
miles from nowhere, Julius, and to 
make it literary, I think I miss my 
fellow man more than anything." 

"Got a girl back home?" Klein 
asked almost casually. 



"Yes." 

"You're not like Dahl. You've 
never mentioned it." 

"Same reason you didn't mention 
your wife. You get to thinking 
about it." 

Klein flipped the lid on the specimen box. "Going to get married 
when you get back?" 

Chapman was at the port again, 
staring out at the bleak landscape. 
"We hope to." 

"Settle down in a small cottage 
and raise lots of little Chapmans, 
eh?" 

Chapman nodded. 

"That's the only future," Klein 
said. 

He put away the box and came 
over to the port. Chapman moved 
over so they both could look out. 

"Chap." Klein hesitated a moment. "What happened to Dixon ?" 

"He died," Chapman said. "He 
was a good kid, all wrapped up in 
science. Being on the Moon was 
the opportunity of a lifetime. He 
thought so much about it that he 
forgot a lot of little things — like 
how to stay alive. The day before 
the Second group came, he went 
out to finish some work he was interested in. He forgot to check for 
leaks and whether or not the valve 
on his tank was all the way closed. 
We couldn't get to him in time." 

"He had his walkie-talkie with 
him?" 

"Yes. It worked fine, too. We 
heard everything that went through 
his mind at the end." 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



147 



Klein's face was blank. "What's 
your real job here, Chap? Why 
does somebody have to stay for 
stopover?" 

"Hell, lots of reasons, Julius. 
You can't get a whole relief crew 
and let them take over cold. They 
have to know where you left off. 
They have to know where things 
are, how things work, what to 
watch out for. And then, because 
you've been here a year and a half 
and know the ropes, you have to 
watch them to see that they stay 
alive in spite of themselves. The 
Moon's a new environment and you 
have to learn how to live in it. 
There's a lot of things to learn — 
and some people just never learn." 

"You're nursemaid, then." 

"I suppose you could call it 
that." 

KLEIN said, "You're not a scientist, are you?" 
"No, you should know that. I 
came as the pilot of the first ship. 
We made the bunker out of parts 
of the ship so there wasn't anything to go back on. I'm a good 
mechanic and I made myself useful with the machinery. When it 
occurred to us that somebody was 
going to have to stay over, I volunteered. I thbught the others were so 
important that it was better they 
should take their samples and data 
back to Earth when the first relief 
ship came." 

"You wouldn't do it again, 
though, would you?" 



"No, I wouldn't." 

"Do you think Dahl will do as 
good a job as you've done here?" 

Chapman frowned. "Frankly, I 
hadn't thought of that. I don't believe I care. I've put in my time; 
it's somebody else's turn. now. He 
volunteered for it. I think I was 
fair in explaining all about the job 
when you talked it over among 
yourselves." 

"You did, but I don't think 
Dahl's the man for it. He's too 
young, too much of a kid. He volunteered because he thought it 
made him look like a hero. He 
doesn't have the judgment that an 
older man would have. That you 
have." 

Chapman turned slowly around 
and faced Klein. 

"I'm not the indispensable man," 
he said slowly, "and even if I was, 
it wouldn't make any difference to 
me. I'm sorry if Dahl is young. So 
was I. I've lost three years up here. 
And I don't intend to lose any 
more." 

Klein held up his hands. "Look, 
Chap, I didn't mean you should 
stay. I know how much you hate 
it and the time you put in up here. 
It's just — " His voice trailed away. 
"It's just that I think it's such a 
damn important job." 

Klein had gone out in a last 
search for rock lichens and Chapman enjoyed one of his relatively 
few moments of privacy. He wandered over to his bunk and opened 
his barracks bag. He checked the 



148 




 



underwear and his toothbrush and 
shaving kit for maybe the hundredth time and pushed the clothing down farther in the canvas. It 
was foolish because the bag was already packed and had been for a 
week. He remembered stalling it 
off for as long as he could and then 
the quiet satisfaction about a week 
before, when he had opened his 
small gear locker and transferred 
its meager belongings to the bag. 

He hadn't actually needed to 
pack, of course. In less than twentyfour hours he'd be back on Earth 
where he could drown himself in 
toothpaste and buy more tee shirts 
than he could wear in a lifetime. 
He could leave behind his shorts 
and socks and the outsize shirts he 
had inherited from — who was it? 
Driesbach? — of the First group. 
Dahl could probably use them or 
maybe one of the boys in the Third. 

BUT it wasn't like going home 
unless you packed. It was part 
of the ritual, like marking off the 
last three weeks in pencil on the 
gray steel of the bulkhead beside 
his hammock. Just a few hours ago, 
when he woke up, he had made the 
last check mark and signed his 
name and the date. His signature 
was right beneath Dixon's. 

He frowned when he thought of 
Dixon and slid back the catch on 
the top of the bag and locked it. 
They should never have sent a kid 
like Dixon to the Moon. 

He had just locked the bag when 



he heard the rumble of the airlock 
and the soft hiss of air. Somebody 
had come back earlier than expected. He watched the inner door 
swing open and the spacesuited 
figure clump in and unscrew its helmet. 

Dahl. He had gone out to help 
Dowden on the Schmidt telescope. 
Maybe Dowden hadn't needed any 
help, with Bening along. Or more 
likely, considering the circumstances, Dahl wasn't much good at 
helping anybody today. 

Dahl stripped off his suit. His 
face was covered with light beads 
of sweat and his eyes were frightened. 

He moistened his lips slightly. 
"Do — do you think they'll ever 
have relief ships up here more 
often than every eighteen months, 
Chap? I mean, considering the advance of — " 

"No," Chapman interrupted 
bluntly. "I don't. Not at least for 
ten years. The fuel's too expensive 
and the trip's too hazardous. On 
freight charges alone you're worth 
your weight in platinum when they 
send you here. Even if it becomes 
cheaper, Bob, it won't come about 
so it will shorten stopover right 
away." He stopped, feeling a little 
sorry for Dahl. "It won't be too 
bad. There'll be new men up here 
and you'll pass a lot of time getting 
to know them." 

"Well, you see," Dahl started, 
"that's why I came back early. I 
wanted to see you about stopover. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



149 



It's that — well, I'll put it this way." 
He seemed to be groping for an 
easy way to say what he wanted to. 
"I'm engaged back home. Really 
nice girl, Chap, you'd like her if 
you knew her." He fumbled in his 
pocket and found a photograph and 
put it on the desk. "That's a picture 
of Alice, taken at a picnic we were 
on together." Chapman didn't look. 
"She — we — expected to be married 
when I got back. I never told her 
about stopover, Chap. She thinks 
I'll be home tomorrow. I kept 
thinking, hoping, that maybe somehow — " 

He was fumbling it badly, Chapman thought. 

"You wanted to trade places with 
me, didn't you, Bob? You thought 
I might stay for stopover again, in 
your place?" 

It hurt to look in Dahl's eyes. 
They were the eyes of a man who 
was trying desperately to stop what 
he was about to do, but just couldn't 
help himself. 



"Well, yes, more or less. Oh, 
God, Chap, I know you want to go 
home! But I couldn't ask any of 
the others; you were the only one 
who could, the only one who was 
qualified !" 

DAHL looked as though he was 
going to be sick. Chapman 
tried to recall all he knew about 
him. Dahl, Robert. Good mathematician. Graduate from one of the 
Ivy League schools. Father was a 
manufacturer of stoves or something. 

It still didn't add, not quite. 
"You know I don't like it here any 
more than you do," Chapman said 
slowly. "I may have commitments 
at home, too. What made you think 
I would change my mind?" 

Dahl took the plunge. "Well, 
you see," he started eagerly, too far 
gone to remember such a thing as 
pride, "you know my father's pretty 
well fixed. We would make it 
worth your while, Chap." He was 




150 




 



feverish. "It would mean eighteen 
more months, Chap, but they'd be 
well-paid months !" 

Chapman felt tired. The good 
feeling he had about going home 
was slowly evaporating. 

"If you have any report to make, 
I think you had better get at it," he 
cut in, keeping all the harshness he 
felt out of his voice. "It'll be too 
late after the relief ship leaves. It'll 
be easier to give the captain your 
report than try to radio it back to 
Earth from here." 

He felt sorrier for Dahl than he 
could ever remember having felt 
for anybody. Long after going' 
home, Dahl would remember this. 



It would eat at him like a cancer. 

Cowardice is the one thing for 
which no man ever forgives himself. 

DONLEY was eating a sandwich and looking out the port, 
so, naturally, he saw the ship 
first. "Well, whaddya know!" he 
shouted. "We got company!" He 
dashed for his suit. Dowden and 
Bening piled after him and all three 
started for the lock. 

Chapman was standing in front 
of it. "Check your suits," he said 
softly. "Just be sure to check." 

"Oh, what the hell, Chap!" Donley started angrily. Then he shut up 
and went over his suit. He got to 
his tank and turned white. Empty. 
It was only half a mile to the relief rocket, so somebody would 
probably have got to him in time, 
but . . . He bit his lips and got a 
full tank. 

Chapman and Klein watched 
them dash across the pumice, mak



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



151 



ing the tremendous leaps they used 
to read about in the Sunday supplements. The port of the rocket had 
opened and tiny figures were climbing down the ladder. The small 
figures from the bunker reached 
them and did a short jig of welcome. Then the figures linked arms 
and started back. Chapman noticed 
one — it was probably Donley — pat 
the ship affectionately before he 
started back. 

They were in the lock and the air 
pumped in and then they were in 
the bunker, taking off their suits. 
The newcomers were impressed and 
solemn, very much aware of the 
tremendous responsibility that 
rested on their shoulders. Like 
Donley and Klein and the members 
of the Second group had been when 
they had landed. Like Chapman 
had been in the First. 

Donley and the others were all 
over them. 

HOW was it back on Earth? 
Who had won the series? 
Was so-and-so still teaching at the 
university? What was the international situation? 

Was the sky still blue, was the 
grass still green, did the leaves still 
turn color in the autumn, did people still love and cry and were there 
still people who didn't know what 
an atom was and didn't give a 
damn ? 

Chapman had gone through it 
all before. But was Ginny still 
Ginny ? 



Some of the men in the Third 
had their luggage with them. One 
of them — a husky, red-faced kid 
named Williams — was opening a 
box about a foot square and six 
inches deep. Chapman watched him 
curiously. 

"Well, I'll be damned!" Klein 
said. "Hey, guys, look what we've 
got here!" 

Chapman and the others crowded 
around and suddenly Donley leaned 
over and took a deep breath. In the 
box, covering a thick layer of ordinary dirt, was a plot of grass. They 
looked at it, awed. Klein put out 
his hand and laid it on top of the 
grass. 

"I like the feel of it," he said 
simply. 

Chapman cut off a single blade 
with his fingernail and put it between his lips. It had been years 
since he had seen grass and had the 
luxury of walking on it and lying 
on its cool thickness during those 
sultry summer nights when it was 
too hot to sleep indoors. 

Williams blushed. "I thought we 
could spare a little water for it and 
maybe use the ultraviolet lamp on 
it some of the time. Couldn't help 
but bring it along; it se'emed sort 
of like a symbol . . ." He looked 
embarrassed. 

Chapman sympathized. If he had 
had any sense, he'd have tried to 
smuggle something like that up to 
the Moon instead of his phonograph. 

"That's valuable grass," Dahl

said sharply. "Do you realize that 
at current freight rates up here, it's 
worth about ten dollars a blade?" 

Williams looked stricken and 
somebody said, "Oh, shut up, 
Dahl." 

One of the men separated from 
the group and came over to Chapman. He held out his hand and 
said, "My name's Eberlein. Captain 
of the relief ship. I understand 
you're in charge here?" 

Chapman nodded and shook 
hands. They hadn't had a captain 
on the First ship. Just a pilot and 
crew. Eberlein looked every inch a" 
captain, too. Craggy face, gray hair, 
the firm chin of a man who was 
sure of himself. 

"You might say I'm in charge 
here," Chapman said. 

"Well, look, Mr. Chapman, is 
there any place where we can talk 
together privately?" 

They walked over to one corner 
of the bunker. "This is about as 
private as we can get, captain," 
Chapman said. "What's on your 
mind?" 

EBERLEIN found a packing 
crate and made himself comfortable. He looked at Chapman. 

"I've always wanted to meet the 
man who's spent more time here 
than anybody else," he began. 

"I'm sure you wanted to see me 
for more reasons than just curiosity" 

Eberlein took out a pack of cigar 
rets. "Mind if I smoke?" 



Chapman jerked a thumb toward Dahl. "Ask him. He's in 
charge now." 

The captain didn't bother. He 
put the pack away. "You know we 
have big plans for the station," he 
said. 

"I hadn't heard of them." 

"Oh, yes, big plans. They're 
working on unmanned, open-side 
rockets now that could carry cargo 
and sheet steel for more bunkers 
like this. Enable us to enlarge the 
unit, have a series of bunkers all 
linked together. Make good laboratories and living quarters for you 
people." His eyes swept the room. 
"Have a little privacy for a change." 

Chapman nodded. "They could 
use a little privacy up here." 

The captain noticed the pronoun. 
"Well, that's one of the reasons 
why I wanted to talk to you, Chapman. The Commission talked it 
over and they'd like to see you stay. 
They feel if they're going to enlarge it, add more bunkers and 
have more men up here, that a man 
of practical experience should be 
running things. They figure that 
you're the only man who's capable 
and who's had the experience." 

The captain vaguely felt the approach was all wrong. 

"Is that all?" 

Eberlein was ill at ease. "Naturally you'd be paid well. I don't 
imagine any man would like being 
here all the time. They're prepared 
to double your salary — maybe even 
a bonus in addition — and let you 



154 




 



have full charge. You'd be Director 
of the Luna Laboratories." 

All this and a title too, Chapman 
thought. 

"That's it?" Chapman asked. 

Eberlein frowned. "Well, the 
Commission said they'd be willing 
to consider anything else you had 
in mind, if it was more money 
or ..." 

"The answer is no," Chapman 
said. "I'm not interested in more 
money for staying because I'm not 
interested in staying. Money can't 
buy it, captain. I'm sorry, but I'm 
afraid that you'd have to stay up 
here to appreciate that. 

"Bob Dahl is staying for stopover. If there's something important about the project or impending 
changes, perhaps you'd better tell 
him before you go." 

He walked away. 

CHAPMAN held the letter in 
both hands, but the paper still 
shook. The others had left the 
bunker, the men of the Second taking those of the Third in hand to 
show them the machinery and apparatus that was outside, point out 
the deadly blisters underneath the 
pumice covering, and show them 
how to keep out of the Sun and 
how to watch their air supply. 

He was glad he was alone. He 
felt something trickle down his face 
and tasted salt on his lips. 

The mail had been distributed 
and he had saved his latest letter 
until the others had left so he could 



read it in privacy. It was a short 
letter, very short. 

It started: "Dear Joel: This isn't 
going to be a nice letter, but I 
thought it best that you should 
know before you came home." 

There was more to it, but he 
hadn't even needed to read it to 
know what it said. It wasn't original, of course. Women who 
change their minds weren't exactly an innovation, either. 

He crumpled the paper and held 
a match to it and watched it burn 
on the steel floor. 

Three years had been a long 
time. It was too long a time to 
keep loving a man who was a quarter of a million miles away. She 
could look up in the night sky 
when she was out with somebody 
else now and tell him how she had 
once been engaged to the Man in 
the Moon. 

It would make good conversation. 
It would be funny. A joke. 

He got up and walked over to 
his phonograph and put the record 
on. The somewhat scratchy voice 
sang as if nothing had happened. 

The home food's the spreadiest, 
The old wine's the_ headiest, 
The old pals the readiest, 
The home gal's the steadiest, 
The love the liveliest, 
The life the loveliest, 
Way back home. 

The record caught and started 
repeating the last line. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



155 



He hadn't actually wanted to play 
it. It had been an automatic response. He had played it lots of 
times before when he had thought 
of Earth. Of going home. 

He crossed over and threw the 
record across the bunker and 
watched it shatter on the steel wall 
and the pieces fall to the floor. 

The others came back in the 
bunker and the men of the Second 
started grabbing their bags and 
few belongings and getting ready 
to leave. Dahl sat in a corner, a 
peculiar expression on his face. He 
looked as if he wanted to cry and 
yet still felt that the occasion was 
one for rejoicing. 

Chapman walked over to him. 
"Get your stuff and leave with the 
others, Dahl." His voice was quiet 
and hard. 

Dahl looked up, opened his 
mouth to say something, and then 
shut up. Donley and Bening and 
Dowden were already in the airlock, ready to leave. Klein caught 
the conversation and came over. He 
gripped Chapman's arm. 

"What the hell's going on, 
Chap? Get your bag and let's go. 
I know just the bistro to throw a 
whing-ding when we get — " 

"I'm not going back," Chapman 
said. 

Klein looked annoyed, not believing him. "Come on, what's the matter with you? You suddenly decide you don't like the blue sky and 
trees and stuff? Let's go!" 

The men in the lock were looking 



at them questioningly. Some members of the Third looked embarrassed, like outsiders caught in a 
family argument. 

"Look, Julius, I'm not going 
back," Chapman repeated dully. "I 
haven't anything to go back for." 

"You're doing a much braver 
thing than you may think," a voice 
cut in. It belonged to Eberlein. 

Chapman looked at him. Eberlein flushed, then turned and 
walked-stiffly to the lock to join the 
others. 

Just before the inner door of the 
lock shut, they could hear Chapman, his hands on his hips, break: 
ing in the Third on how to be 
happy and stay healthy on the 
Moon. His voice was ragged and 
strained and sounded like a topsergeant's. 

DAHL and Eberlein stood in the 
outer port of the relief ship, 
staring back at the research bunker. 
It was half hidden in the shadows 
of a rocky overhang that protected 
it from meteorites. 

"They kidded him a lot this 
morning," Dahl said. "They said 
he had found a home on the 
Moon." J 

"If we had stayed an hour or so 
more, he might have changed his 
mind and left, after all," Eberlein 
mused, his face a thoughtful mask 
behind his air helmet. 

"I offered him money," Dahl 
said painfully. "I was a coward and 
I offered him money to stay in my

place." His face was bitter and 
full of disgust for himself. 

Eberlein turned to him quickly 
and automatically told him the 
right thing. 

"We're all cowards once in a 
while," he said earnestly. "But your 
offer of money had nothing to do 
with his staying. He stayed because 
he had to stay, because we made 
him stay." 

"I don't understand," Dahl said. 

"Chapman had a lot to go home 
for. He was engaged to be married." Dahl winced. "We got her 
to write him a letter breaking it off. 
We knew it meant that he lost one 
of his main reasons for wanting to 
go back. I think, perhaps, that he 
still would have left if we had 
stayed and argued him into going. 
But we left before he could change 
his mind." 

"That — was a lousy thing to do!" 

"We had no choice. We didn't 
use it except as a last resort." 

"I don't know of any girl who 
would have done such a thing, no 
matter what your reasons, if she 
was in love with a guy like Chapman," Dahl said. 

"There was only one who would 
have," Eberlein agreed. "Ginny 
Dixon. She understood what we 
were trying to tell her. She had to; 
her brother had died up here." 

"Why was Chapman so important?" Dahl burst out. "What could 
he have done that I couldn't have 
done — would have done if I had 
had any guts?" 



"Perhaps you could have," Eberlein said. "But I doubt it. I don't 
think there were many men who 
could have. And we couldn't take 
the chance. Chapman knows how 
to live on the Moon. He's like a 
trapper who's spent all his time in 
the forests and knows it like the 
palm of his hand. He never makes 
mistakes, he never fails to check 
things. And he isn't a scientist. He 
would never become so preoccupied 
with research that he'd fail to make 
checks. And he can watch out for 
those who do make mistakes. Ginny 
understood that all too well." 

"How did you know all this 
about Chapman?" Dahl asked. 

"The men in the First told us 
some of it. And we had our own 
observer with you here. Bening 
kept us pretty well informed." 

TjlBERLEIN stared at the bunker 
-Hi thoughtfully. 

"It costs a lot of money to send 
ships up here and establish a colony. It will cost a lot to expand it. 
And with that kind of investment, 
you don't take chances. You have 
to have the best men for the job. 
You get them even if they don't 
want to do it." 

He gestured at the small, blotchy 
globe of blue and green that was 
the Earth, riding high in the black 
sky. 

"You remember what it was like 
five years ago, Dahl? Nations at 
each other's throats, re-arming to 
the teeth? It isn't that way now.

We've got the one lead that nobody 
can duplicate or catch up on. Nobody has our technical background. 
I know, this isn't a military base. 
But it could become one." 
He paused. 

"But these aren't even the most 
important reasons, Dahl. We're at 
the beginnings of space travel, the 
first bare, feeble start. If this base 
on the Moon succeeds, the whole 
human race will be Outward 
Bound." He waved at the stars. 
"You have your choice — a frontier 
that lies in the stars, or a psychotic 
little world that tries and fails 
and spends its time and talents trying to find better methods of suicide. 

"With a choice like that, Dahl, 
you can't let it fail. And personal 
lives and viewpoints are expendable. But it's got to be that way. 
There's too much at stake." 

Eberlein hesitated a moment and 
when he started again, it was on a 
different track. "You're an odd 
bunch of guys, you and the others 
in the groups, Dahl. Damn few of 
you come up for the glamor, I 
know. None of you like it and none 
of you are really enthusiastic about 
it. You were all reluctant to come 
in the first place, for the most part. 
You're a bunch of pretty reluctant 
heroes, Dahl." 

The captain nodded soberly at 
the bunker. "I, personally, don't 
feel happy about that. I don't like 
having to mess up other people's 
lives. I hope I won't have to again. 



Maybe somehow, someway, this one 
can be patched up. We'll try to." 

He started the mechanism that 
closed the port of the rocket. His 
face was a study of regret and helplessness. He was thinking of a future that, despite what he had told 
Dahl, wasn't quite real to him. 

"I feel like a cheap son of a 
bitch," Eberlein said. 

HPHE very young man said, "Do 
* they actually care where they 
send us? Do they actually care what 
we think?" 

The older man got up and 
walked to the window. The bunkers 
and towers and squat buildings of 
the research colony glinted in the 
sunlight. The colony had come a 
long way; it housed several thousands now. 

The Sun was just rising for the 
long morning and farther down 
shadows stabbed across the crater 
floor. Tycho was by far the most 
beautiful of the craters, he thought. 

It was nice to know that the very 
young man was going to miss it. It 
had taken the older man quite a 
long time to get to like it. But that 
was to be expected — he hadn't been 
on the Moon. 

"I would say so," he said. "They 
were cruel, that way, at the start. 
But then they had to be. The goal 
was too important. And they made 
up for it as soon as they could. It 
didn't take them too long to remember the men who had traded 
their future for the stars." 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



159 



The very young man said, "Did 
you actually think of it that way 
when you first came up here?" 

The older man thought for a 
minute. "No," he admitted. "No, 
we didn't. Most of us were strictly 
play-for-pay men. The Commission 
wanted men who wouldn't fall 
apart when the glamor wore off 
and there was nothing left but privation and hard work and loneliness. The men who fell for the 
glamor were all right for quick 
trips, but not for an eighteen-month 
stay in a research bunker. So the 
Commission offered high salaries 
and we reluctantly look the jobs.

"Oh, there was the idea behind 
the project, the vision the Commission had in mind. But it took a 
while for that to grow." 

A woman came in the room just 
then, bearing a tray with glasses on 
it. The older man took one and 
said, "Your mother and I were 
notified yesterday that you had been 
chosen to go. We ivould like to see 
you go, but of course the final decision is up to you." 

He sipped his drink and turned 
to his wife: "It has its privations, 
but in the long run we've never regretted it, have we, Ginny?"
