Susceptibility By JOHN D. McDONALD 



SEAN MALLOY stood unnoticed at the edge of the clearing and frowned as he 
watched the girl work. Exposure to 
the rays of the yellow-white sun, 
half again the size of Sol, had 
turned her to copper bronze, 
against which the mane of yellow 
hair was cjuite startling. He found 
that he was taking pleasure in 
watching the smooth play of 
muscles in her naked back as she 
swung the instrument against the 
tree. Each stroke bit out a chunk 



of the soft yellowish wood, veined 
with green. Exertion had put a 
sheen of perspiration on her shoulders. 

The proper paleolingual word 
eluded him. Suddenly he remembered. Of course — it was an ax. 

The sound of it, biting into the 
wood, resounded across the clearing, a sharp, metronomic sound. 
He heard the crackle of fibers and 
saw her step back from the tree. 
Sean Malloy glanced up then, and 
saw the great mass of branches and 

leaves sway toward him. He gave 
a gasp of alarm, and forgetting all 
the dignity of a Praecursor from 
the Colonial Adjustments Bureau, 
he ran at right angles to the line of 
fall. After fifty feet of surprising 
fleetness, he struck a hummock of 
grass and fell just at the moment 
the tree thundered to the ground, 
so close behind him that the end 
of a branch rapped him smartly 
across the shoulders. He crawled 
out from under the leaves and 
stood up. The tall woman was 
hurrying toward him, buttoning on 
a shirt of coarse fabric, quick concern in her eyes. 

"You're not hurt?" 

"It so happens that I'm not," he 
said acidly. 

He saw her glance take in his 
uniform, the CAB seal, the tiny 
gold question mark of the Praecursor blazoned upon it. She no 
longer looked concerned. 

"People who wait for trees to 
fall on them generally get hurt," 
she said indifferently. 

"I am Sean Malloy, Praecursor. 
They told me, in the village, that I 
should talk to you. You are Deen 
Thomason ?" 

She nodded. She looked regretfully at the tree. "I suppose I can 
just as well finish it tomorrow. 
Come along, Malloy." 

She shouldered the ax and headed across the clearing to the mouth 
of a narrow trail. Her stride was 
long. Once again Malloy found 
himself taking a rather surprising 



pleasure in watching her. He made 
a mental note to apply, on his return to the Bureau, for deep psychological analysis. Praecursors who 
became emotionally involved with 
colonial women suffered a loss of 
efficiency. It would be wise to have 
this susceptibility tracked down and 
eliminated. In the meantime, to 
take his attention away from the 
swing of her walk, he asked hastily, 
"What were you planning to do 
with the tree, Thomason?" 

"Cut off the branches today, saw 
it tomorrow, then split it and carry 
the pieces back to my place." 

"But why?" he asked, baffled. 

SHE stopped so suddenly that he' 
almost ran into her. She turnedaround and he saw a mixture of 
amusement and irony in her grayeyes. ' • 

"Our winter season is coming, 
Malloy," she said. "I burn the 
wood in order to keep warm." 

She was almost as tall as he. He 
said, as though reasoning with a 
child, "Wouldn't it be much simpler to ask for a heat unit? There's 
a field station here, an unlimited 
power source. All you have to do 
is . . ." 

"Of course, Malloy. It just so 
happens that I'd rather do it this 
way." 

"But . . ." 

She had turned again and was 
striding along the trail. He had to 
trot to catch up with her. They 
emerged into a second clearing. A

crude wooden house sat at the base 
of a hill, and he was forced to admit that the setting, with the small 
busy stream foaming through the 
rocky channel, was superb. Primitive, though. 

He followed her to the door of 
the house. It was open. 

"Where is your mate?" he asked, 
realizing too late that his choice of 
words had been a bit hasty. It was 
undiplomatic to point out the backwardness of this unfortunate social 
order without shrewd preparation. 

She looked more amused than 
angered. "Sit down, Malloy. I have 
not yet mated, if that's what you 
Bureau people prefer to call it." 

"You built this house yourself?" 

"No. I selected the spot. All the 
others helped me. It was built in 
two days. The Bureau would have 
been horrified. Everyone working 
with their hands. Dancing and 
food that didn't come from the 
field station and a strong brew 
made from fruits. Very barbaric." 

He sat at a bench beside a 
wooden table. She lifted a trap 
door, went down steps and returned 
with a corked earthenware -jug. She 
poured a cup of water and handed 
it to him. The day was warm, the 
water cool and sweet. 

"Thank you," he said. She sat 
opposite him. 

He smiled officially. "Well, shall 
we get to it, Thomason ? It took me 
a long time to find you. And I 
didn't expect anyone like you to 
be . . . head of the planet."

"Let us be accurate, Malloy. This' 
year it happened to be my turn to 
represent the village at general 
meeting, and also the turn of my 
village to supply the chairman for 
the meeting." 

MALLOY gave her a pained 
look. "My dear young woman, my duty involves contacting 
the person in charge here. Are you 
or are you not in charge?" 

"If you could say anyone is in 
charge, I suppose I am." 

"Then you keep the records, I 
gather. Issue orders. Take care of 
administration." 

"There are no records to keep, 
Malloy. I issued one order, I think. 
I set the day of the next meeting. 
And the villages administer themselves." 

Malloy stood up, walked to the 
stone fireplace, turned abruptly. 
"Please, Thomason. A Praecursor 
named Zedder was sent here to 
Able XII seven Earth years ago, 
five and a half of your years. His 
job was to find out why the field 
station was almost unutilized, why 
there were no entertainment imports, why you were canceled off 
the tour schedules for lack of business. Zedder came here and put his 
ship on homing automatic with his 
resignation fastened to the flight 
panel. That was so unusual that 
Able XII was put on emergency 
priority. Our press of business is so 
great that this is the first time you 
have had Bureau contact since then. 


 



"I came here expecting to find 
most of the population gone. At 
first I thought I was right. No one 
seems to live at the Centers the 
Bureau built for you people. Then 
I found you of Able XII living out 
here in these crude villages and 
shacks. It has taken me two full 
weeks to locate you, Thomason. 
I'm a busy man. A very busy man. 
The field station is in perfect working order. I've tested it. I projected 
a perfectly satisfactory little flier, 
synthesized foods at random from 
the list that checked perfectly, even 
used the tele-tubes from Center to 
Center. My job is to find out what's 
wrong here, Thomason." 

"Does something have to be 
wrong?" she demanded. 

"Don't try my patience, Thomason." 

Her gray eyes narrowed a bit. "I 
can think of very few things I'm 
more indifferent to, Malloy, than 
your patience or lack of patience. 
This is my home. You have all the 
normal privileges of a guest. An 
autocratic attitude is not one of 
those privileges." 

He sat down wearily. "I'm sorry. 
It's just that I'm upset. Where's 
Zedder?" 

"I'm sure I haven't the faintest 
idea." 

"Isn't there any central record 
of population? Any index?" 

"We don't find that necessary, 
Malloy." 

"I can't spare the time to hunt 
in every village for him. I've got 



four more emergency priority cases 
to cover in other parts of the 
Galaxy." 

"Then why don't you just get 
back into whatever you came here 
in and go take care of them?" 

HE LIFTED his chin. "When 
the Colonial Bureau sets up 
proper resident facilities on a planet 
and stocks the planet with colonists, and when said colonists fail 
to use the facilities provided, it is 
the duty of the Colonial Adjustments Bureau to send a Praecursor 
to make investigation and recommendation as to what sort of adjustment team should be sent to 
rectify said non-utilization of 
standard facilities." 

She looked amused. "I assume 
you're quoting from some sort of 
absurd manual, Malloy. Does it actually use the word 'stock' ? As with 
fish in a pond?" 

"There is a case on record where 
one colonial planet suffered such an 
emotional degeneration that the 
colonists acquired a superstitious 
fear of Center facilities and moved 
off into the woods." 

"And they were adjusted?" Deen 
Thomason asked mildly. 

"Re-educated," Malloy amended. 
"That sounds dreadful. Just report, Praecursor, that the inhabitants of Able XII prefer a so-called 
primitive life, and that the facilities of the Centers and the field 
station are used when emergencies 
arise."

"That will make no sense to the 
Bureau," he said hotly. "You people live out here in absolute 
squalor. All the Center homes are 
empty. Insects have gotten in. Of 
course they can do no damage, but 
they have spun webs on the projector dials. It's untidy, a criminal 
waste. You could move to a Center. Everything you could possibly 
desire would be no farther from 
your hand than the nearest dial. It 
is incomprehensible to me, Thomason, that you should prefer to 
walk back into the earliest history 
of your race. Every possible comfort 
was made available when this colonial planet was set up for . . ." 

She raised her hand. "Please, 
Malloy. Stand up a moment." 

He stood up, puzzled. She 
walked around the table, smiled 
enigmatically at him and suddenly, 
clenching her fist, she struck him 
hard in the diaphragm. He had 
just enough warning so that he was 
able to tense his muscles against the 
blow. Even so, it almost took his 
breath. 

"To strike a Praecursor is . . ." 

"Oh, stop being so stuffy! Why 
are you a Praecursor? Why are you 
reasonably lean and hard and fit? 
Why aren't you sitting plump and 
happy within arm's reach of a dial 
on your home planet?" 

He stared at her. "Why, I . . . 
there have to be Praecursors !" 

"That point is debatable. But 
I'm asking why you are one." 

"I like problems and new places, 



I suppose," he said hesitantly. 
"And I have to keep fit because 
sometimes I run into . . . strenuous 
situations. But no one forced me 
to be a Praecursor." 

"Exactly," she said. 

"I hope you realize that you are 
not making sense, Thomason." 

"Indeed? I thought I was making a great deal of sense. Anyway, 
you can report that we are not completely lost. One of the Centers is 
occupied, you know." 

"Is it? Good! Which one?" 

"Number Six. I'd like to visit it 
with you. I have a reason, Malloy." 

He pressed the stud on his time 
ring and the correct sun time of the 
Able XII twenty-hour day came 
into his mind. He knew that she 
was standing near enough to him 
so that she caught it, too, though 
less strongly. She chuckled, and it 
was a surprisingly warm sound. 

"Why are you laughing?" he 
asked. 

"That toy. See the sun pattern 
on the floor? From that I could 
have told you the time within a 
half hour." 

"Not much of a degree of accuracy." 

<< A GAIN you've missed the 
XX point, Malloy. It's accurate 
enough." 

"I can't argue with unreason. 
Come on. That flier I projected is 
beyond the clearing where I found 
you. I'll leave it with you when I 

g°-"

"Thank you. I'd have no use for 
it. And we should eat before we 
go-" 

"We'll eat at the Center." 

"Thank you, no. I'll get us something here. First, though, I must 
bathe." 

He looked around the room. "No 
cleansing unit here." 

"There's a perfectly good one in 
the stream, Malloy." She went to 
the shelves near the fireplace, selected a tunic of softer fabric than 
her work clothes, and a heavy 
towel. "You can make yourself useful, Malloy. Build a small fire in 
the fireplace. But first come here a 
moment. That's my garden. See 
those spiky green things? Pull up 
about a dozen of them and wash 
them in the stream." 

Before he could decide whether 
or not to refuse the request, she 
had gone, walking toward the 
stream with that long stride of hers, 
supple and somehow wild. He selected small sticks and tried with 
infuriating lack of success to start 
them burning by using a short hot 
focus of his pocket heat unit. Angry 
at failing in so simple a task, he 
walked out and yanked up a dozen 
of the growths she had indicated. 
Black moist soil clung to the bulbular white ends that came out of 
the ground. 

He took them to the stream, below the wider part that formed a 
pool. Remembering the extreme 
variations in attitudes of modesty 
on the colonial planets, he did not 



wish to look directly at her. Precursors were trained to adapt themselves readily to many odd folkways. But in spite of his intentions 
he found himself gawking at her as 
she stood by the pool, tall and 
tanned and lithe. She smiled down 
the slope at him as she toweled her 
shining hair and he made a comparison oddly damaging to the soft 
pallid women of home. 

She belted the short aqua tunic 
around her slim waist and he followed her back to the house. As 
he watched her she put some dried 
moss under the sticks in the fireplace, scratched an object which he 
recognized as being one of the 
crude nremaking devices of earliest 
times. It was called, he remembered, 
a "match." The small fire blazed. 
She brought ovoid white objects 
from the cellar, cracked them into 
an earthenware dish, chopped the 
bulbous white growths with a 
crude knife and stirred them into 
the mixture. The dish was then suspended over the flame while she 
sawed off heavy slabs of coarse 
bread, spread them with a yellow 
substance. 

MALLOY watched closely. This 
primitive substitute for the 
extremely simple procedure of operating the synthesizer would form 
an interesting portion of his report. 
The odor that filled the room, however, made his salivary glands surprisingly active. The mixture firmed 
and she took the dish from over

the fire, divided the contents into 
two parts, placed one part between 
two heavy slabs of bread and put 
it on another dish, set it in front 
of him. 

Malloy took a cautious bite and 
then a much larger one. The taste 
was harsher and more concentrated, 
the texture far coarser than any 
food he had ever tasted before. 

Before he knew it, his share was 
gone. She washed the dishes in the 
stream and replaced them on the 
shelf. 

"That was very interesting," he 
said. 

"But nothing you'd care for day 
in and day out?" 

"N-no," he said. 

She smiled. "I'm ready, Malloy. 
Shall we go?" 

They walked to the small flier. 
Malloy watched her closely. She 
had no awe of it, accepted it as 
something routine and unimpressive. He ducked under the low 
door, sat down beside her, lifted 
the flier off the ground, swung 
around the crest of a clump of trees. 

"Let me see," he said, "six would 
be . . ." 

"Turn it a bit to your right, 
Malloy. That's enough." 

Air whined by as he upped the 
speed. Cabin heat increased and the 
cooling unit came on. The ground 
streamed by far below, flattened by 
the height. 

He said, in a fatherly tone, "This 
would be a long trip afoot, the way 
you people seem to travel." 



"Several days, Malloy. Through 
country where pine woods cover the 
hills, where silvery fish leap high 
in the lakes, where the trees hold 
wild honey. At dusk you come to a 
village. You are always made welcome. Cheese and bread and wine 
and dancing in the dusk, and the 
fireflies are like little lanterns." 

"Oh," he said distantly. 

"But your way is, of course, much 
quicker," she added. 

"I see the Center," he said. 

HE BROUGHT the flier around 
in a long swooping curve and 
dropped it lightly onto cleared land 
outside the gates. Even as he got 
out he saw people walking in the 
wide pastel streets of the Center. 
It was like a scene from home. They 
wore clothes of all shades, hues, 
fancies, whims. A completely anachronistic shack stood outside the 
gate, though. A tall young man 
with a full blond beard sat with his 
back against the door frame. He 
grinned and stood up as Malloy 
and Deen approached. He wore the 
crude garments of the villagers. 
"Thomason, isn't it?" he asked. 
"That's right. This is just an inspection trip." 

"Go right ahead," he said. 
He turned to a metallic plate set 
beside the rude door, depressed a 
switch. Malloy, slightly baffled, 
followed Deen through the gate. 
As he passed through he felt the 
momentary tingle of a space-twist 
fence temporarily reversed. 



134 




 



Then he straightened his shoulders. He walked beside Thomason. 
"You see how pleasant life can be 
in a Center?" he asked proudly. 

A well-larded woman sat in the 
sun playing with two romping fuzzy 
creatures she had created out of the 
mental projector. Beyond her a man 
slept propped against a wall, halfempty bottles surrounding him. 

"Very pleasant," Thomason said. 

"They all have everything they 
want. Who would want to live out 
in the brush when everything is 
right here, within arm's reach? Exotic foods, toys, amusement." 

"Who indeed?" Thomason 
stressed with gentle irony. 
. Malloy beamed at the colonists. 
They had the familiar triple chins 
of the home planet, the same shortness of breath, the same bland look 
that comes of satiety in all things. 
But he was puzzled by the way they 
stared at the two of them. Dulled 
eyes, with the glow of resentment 
almost submerged. 

At the end of the street he 
stopped. "But the rest of the Center is empty!" he said. 

"Yes. There's just this one 
street. We can't go any farther. 
The fence will stop us." 

She turned and started back. He 
caught her in two quick strides, 
grasped her arm and pulled her 
around roughly. "Why have you 
people installed a twist fence 
around this street?" 

"Because there's no need to put 
it around a bigger area." 



"Why put it around any area?" 
he shouted into her face. 

"You are rude," she said coldly. 
"And more stupid than I thought. 
We'll walk back slowly. Look at 
their faces, JVIalloy. Look long and 
well. You see, this is the penal 
colony for this planet." 

The breath whoofed out of him. • 
"Penal? But . . . Wait. Anybody 
who lives here can have every last 
thing they want." 

"Exactly," she said. 

Subdued, he walked beside her 
and he looked at their faces. 

IT WAS dusk in the heart of the 
village. He heard the thin eager 
voices of children at play. Smoke 
from the cook fires lost itself in 
the grayness overhead where the 
first strange star patterns were beginning to appear. Deen sat with 
her -back against a tree. Sean Malloy lay stretched out on the grass 
on his back, the concavity of the 
nape of his neck fitting comfortably 
over the warm convexity of her 
thigh. 

An insect lit on the back of his 
hand and he slapped it. He 
squirmed a 'bit. He wasn't yet accustomed to the scratchiness of 
homespun clothes. He squinted up 
at the skies and thought of his ship 
speeding toward Bureau headquarters, the resignation affixed to the 
automatic controls. This was the 
third night back at her home. 

"A crazy thing to do," he muttered. 



SUSCEPTIBILITY 



135 



She took her cool fingertips from 
his forehead abruptly. "Sorry you 
did it, Sean?" she asked a bit frigidly. 

He captured her hand, kissed the 
palm. "Not the way it sounded. My 
ship will get back there. They'll 
give Able XII a double priority. A 
new Praecursor will be here in 
probably less than four years. He 
may send an adjustment team." 

The children were being called 
in from play. A few hundred feet 
down the unpaved main street 
came' the -first tentative sounds of 
music. 

"I wouldn't worry about that, 
Sean," she said softly. 

He sat up, faced her. "Why in 
Sol not?" 

She smiled at him. "Because 
when he comes, he'll go looking 
for the person in charge, won't 
he?" 

"Naturally." 

"It was decided a long time ago 
that what little centralized administration we need should be handled by those of us least likely to 
be hungry for that sort of power." 

"I don't get the connection." 

"Village representatives to the 
general meeting are always unmarried girls, and are always those considered to be the most pleasing to 
the eye. And we are beginning to 



find that anyone who has become a 
Praecursor seems peculiarly . . . 
susceptible to this sort of existence." 

HE WAS silent for a long time, 
and then he laughed. "Poor 
Zedder," he said. 

"And poor Malloy," she added 
teasingly. 

Suddenly he became suspicious. 
"Did you have orders to — to — " 

"Seduce the Praecursor? How 
strangely short your memory is, my 
Sean! I seem to remember that the 
shoe was on the other foot." She 
stood up quickly and held out her 
hand. "Come. They will expect us 
to dance. I shall teach you. It will 
make you hungry for the wedding 
feast." 

"How barbaric!" muttered the 
ex-Praecursor as he urgently uptilted her mouth. 

"How primitive you're becoming!" she taunted, and writhed out 
of his arms. 

He caught her finally, but only 
because she let him. He needed 
some woodchopping and farming, 
maybe some hunting and hiking, 
too, before he could outrun her 
legitimately. A couple of months 
and she would see who was the 
stronger.
