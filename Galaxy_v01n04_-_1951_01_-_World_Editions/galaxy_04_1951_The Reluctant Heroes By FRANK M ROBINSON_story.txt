The Reluctant Heroes By FRANK M. ROBINSON 

THE very young man sat on 
the edge of the sofa and 
looked nervous. He carefully studied his fingernails and ran 
his hands through his hair and 
picked imaginary lint off the upholstery. 

"I have a chance to go with the 
first research expedition to Venus," 
he said. 

The older man studied the very 
young man thoughtfully and then 
leaned over to his humidor and 
offered him a cigaret. "It's nice to 
have the new air units now. There 
was a time when we had to be very 
careful about things like smoking." 

The verv young man was annoyed. 

"I don't think I want to go," he 
blurted. "I don't think I would care 
to spend two years there." 

The older man blew a smoke 
ring and watched it drift toward 
the air exhaust vent. 

"You mean you would miss it 
here, the people you've known and 
grown up with, the little familiar 
things that have made up your life 
here. You're afraid the glamor 
would wear off and you would get 
to hate it on Venus." 

The very young man nodded 
miserably. "1 guess that's it." 




"Anything else?" 

The very young man found his 
fingernails extremely fascinating 
again and finally said, in a low 
voice, "Yes, there is." 

"A girl?" 

A nod confirmed this. 

It was the older man's turn to 
look thoughtful. "You know, I'm 
sure, that psychologists and research 
men agree that research stations 
should be staffed by couples. That 
is, of course, as soon as it's practical." 

"But that might be a long time!" 
the very young man protested. 
"It might be — but sometimes it's 



sooner than you think. And the 
goal is worth it." 

"I suppose so, but — " 

The older man smiled. "Still the 
reluctant heroes," he said, somewhat to himself. 




HAPMAN stared at the radio 
1 key. 



Three years on the Moon and 
they didn't want him to come back. 

Three years on the Moon and 
they thought he'd be glad to stay 
for more. Just raise his salary or 
give him a bonus, the every-manhas-his-price idea. They probably 
thought he liked it there. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES

Oh, sure, he loved it. Canned 
coffee, canned beans, canned pills, 
and canned air until your insides 
felt as though they were plated 
with tin. Life in a cramped, smelly 
little hut where you could take only 
ten steps in any one direction. 
Their little scientific home of tomorrow with none of the modern 
conveniences, a charming place 
where you couldn't take a shower, 
couldn't brush your teeth, and your 
kidneys didn't work right. 

And for double his salary they 
thought he'd be glad to stay for another year and a half. Or maybe 
three. He should probably be glad 
he had the opportunity. 

The key started to stutter again, 
demanding an answer. 

He tapped out his reply: "No!" 

There was a silence and then the 
key stammered once more in a sudden fit of bureaucratic rage. Chapman stuffed a rag under it and ignored it. He turned to the hammocks, strung against the bulkhead 
on the other side of the room. 

The chattering of the key hadn't 
awakened anybody; they were still 
asleep, making the animal noises 
that people usually make in slumber. Dowden, half in the bottom 
hammock and half on the floor, was 
snoring peacefully. Dahl, the poor 
kid who was due for stopover, was 
mumbling to himself. Julius Klein, 
with that look of ineffable happiness on his face, looked as if he had 
just squirmed under the tent to his 
personal idea of heaven. Donley 



and Bening were lying perfectly 
still, their covers not mussed, sleeping very lightly. 

Lord, Chapman thought, I'll be 
happy when I can see some other 
faces. 

"What'd they want?" Klein had 
one eyelid open and a questioning 
look on his face. 

"They wanted me to stay until 
the next relief ship lands," Chapman whispered back. 

"What did you say?" 

He shrugged. "No." 

"You kept it short," somebody 
else whispered. It was Donley, up 
and sitting on the side of his hammock. "If it had been me, I would 
have told them just what they could 
do about it." 

THE others were awake now, 
with the exception of Dahl who 
had his face to the bulkhead and a 
pillow over his head. 

Dowden rubbed his eyes sleepily. "Sore, aren't you?" 

"Kind of. Who wouldn't be?" 
"Well, don't let it throw you. 
They've never been here on the 
Moon. They don't know what it's 
like. All they're trying to do is get 
a good man to stay on the job a 
while longer." 

"All they're trying to do," Chapman said sarcastically. "They've got 
a fat chance." 

"They think you've found a 
home here," Donley said. 

"Why the hell don't you guys 
shut up until morning?" Dahl was 



142 




 



awake, looking bitter. "Some of us 
still have to stay here, you know. 
Some of us aren't going back today." 

No, Chapman thought, some of 
us aren't going back. You aren't. 
And Dixon's staying, too. Only 
Dixon isn't ever going back. 

Klein jerked his thumb toward 
Dahl's bunk, held a finger to his 
lips, and walked noiselessly over to 
the small electric stove. It was his 
day for breakfast duty. 

The others started lacing up their 
bunks, getting ready for their last 
day of work on the Moon. In a few 
hours they'd be relieved by members of the Third research group 
and they'd be on their way back to 
Earth. 

And that includes me, Chapman 
thought. I'm going home. I'm 
finally going home. 

He walked silently to the one 
small, quartz window in the room. 
It was morning — the Moon's 
"morning" — and he shivered 
slightly. The rays of the Sun were 
just striking the far rim of the 
crater and long shadows shot across 
the crater floor. The rest of it was 
still blanketed in a dark jumble of 
powdery pumice and jagged peaks 
that would make the Black Hills of 
Dakota look like paradise. 

A hundred yards from the research bunker he could make out 
the small mound of stones and the 
forlorn homemade cross, juryrigged out of small condensed milk 
tins slid over crossed iron bars. You 



could still see the footprints in the 
powdery soil where the group had 
gathered about the grave. It had 
been more than eighteen months 
ago, but there was no wind to wear 
those tracks away. They'd be there 
forever. 

That's what happened to guys 
like Dixon, Chapman thought. On 
the Moon, one mistake could use 
up your whole quota of chances. 

Klein came back with the coffee. 
Chapman took a cup, gagged, and 
forced himself to swallow the rest 
of it. It had been in the can for so 
long you could almost taste the 
glue on the label. 

DONLEY was warming himself 
over his cup, looking thoughtful. Dowden and Bening were 
struggling into their suits, getting 
ready to go outside. Dahl was still 
sitting on his hammock, trying to 
ignore them. 

"Think we ought to radio the 
space station and see if they've left 
there yet?" Klein asked. 

"I talked to them on the last 
call," Chapman said. "The relief 
ship left there twelve hours ago. 
They should get here"- — he looked 
at his watch — "in about six and a 
half hours." 

"Chap, you know, I've been 
thinking," Donley said quietly. 
"You've been here just twice as 
long as the rest of us. What's the 
first thing you're going to do once 
you get back?" 

It hit them, then. Dowden and 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



143 



Bening looked blank for a minute 
and blindly found packing cases 
to sit on. The top halves of their 
suits were still hanging on the bulkhead. Klein lowered his coffee cup 
and looked grave. Even Dahl 
glanced up expectantly. 

"I don't know," Chapman said 
slowly. "I guess I was trying not to 
think of that. I suppose none of us 
have. We've been like little kids 
who have waited so long for Christmas that they just can't believe it 
when it's finally Christmas Eve." 

Klein nodded in agreement. "I 
haven't been here three years like 
you have, but I think I know what 
you mean." He warmed up to it as 
the idea sank in. "Just what the 
hell are you going to do?" 

"Nothing very spectacular," 
Chapman said, smiling. "I'm going 



to rent a room over Times Square, 
get a recording of a rikky-tik piano, 
and drink and listen to the music 
and watch the people on the street 
below. Then I think I'll see somebody." 

"Who's the somebody?" Donley 
asked. 

Chapman grinned. "Oh, just 
somebody. What are you going to 
do, Dick?" 

"Well, I'm going to do something practical. First of all, I want 
to turn over all my geological samples to the government. Then I'm 
going to sell my life story to the 
movies and then — why, then, I 
think I'll get drunk!" 

Everybody laughed and Chapman turned to Klein. 

"How about you, Julius?" 

Klein looked solemn. "Like 



144 




 



Dick, I'll first get rid of my obligations to the expedition. Then I 
think I'll go home and see my 
wife." 

They were quiet. "I thought all 
members of the groups were supposed to be single," Donley said. 

"They are. And I can see their 
reasons for it. But who could pass 
up the money the Commission was 
paying?" 

"If I had to do it all over again ? 
Me," said Donley promptly. 

They laughed. Somebody said: 
"Go play your record, Chap. Today's the day for it." 

The phonograph was a small, 
wind-up model that Chapman had 
smuggled in when he had landed 
with the First group. The record 
was old and the shellac was nearly 
worn off, but the music was good. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



The roads are the dustiest, 
The winds are the gustiest 
The gates are the rustiest, 
The pies are the crustiest, 
The songs are the lustiest, 
The friends the trustiest, 
Way back home* 

THEY ran through it twice. 
They were beginning to feel it 
now, Chapman thought. They were 
going to go home in a little while 
and the idea was just starting to 
sink in. 

"You know, Chap," Donley said, 
"it won't seem like the same old 
Moon without you on it. Why, 
we'll look at it when we're out 
spooning or something and it just 
won't have the same old appeal." 

"Like they say in the army," 
Bening said, "you never had it so 
good. You found a home here." 

The others chimed in and Chapman grinned. Yesterday or a week 
ago they couldn't have done it. He 
had been there too long and he had 
hated it too much. 

The party quieted down after a 
while and Dowden and Bening finished getting into their suits. They 
still had a section of the sky to map 
before they left. Donley was right 
after them. There was an outcropping of rock that he wanted a sample of and some strata he wished to 
investigate. 

And the time went faster when 
you kept busy.

Chapman stopped them at the 
lock. "Remember to check your 
suits for leaks," he warned. "And 
check the valves of your oxygen 
tanks." 

Donley looked sour. "I've gone 
out at least five hundred times," he 
said, "and you check me each time." 

"And I'd check you five hundred more," -Chapman said. "It 
takes only one mistake. And watch 
out for blisters under the pumice 
crust. You go through one of those 
and that's it, brother." 

Donley sighed. "Chap, you watch 
us like an old mother hen. You see 
we check our suits, you settle our 
arguments, you see that we're not 
bored and that we stay healthy and 
happy. I think you'd blow our noses 
for us if we caught cold. But some 
day, Chap old man, you're gonna 
find out that your little boys can 
watch out for themselves!" 

But he checked his suit for leaks 
and tested the valve of his tank 
before he left. 

Only Klein and Chapman were 
left in the bunker. Klein was at the 
work table, carefully labeling some 
lichen specimens. 

"I never knew you were married," Chapman said. 

Klein didn't look up. "There 
wasn't much sense in talking about 
it. You just get to thinking and 
wanting — and there's nothing you 
can do about it. You talk about it 
and it just makes it worse." 

"She let you go without any fuss, 
huh?" 



146 




 



"No, she didn't make any fuss. 
But I don't think she liked to see 
me go, either." He laughed a little. 
"At least I hope she didn't." 

THEY were silent for a while. 
"What do you miss most, 
Chap?" Klein asked. "Oh, I know 
what we said a little while ago, but 
I mean seriously." 

Chapman thought a minute. "I 
think I miss the sky," he said quietly. "The blue sky and the green 
grass and trees with leaves on them 
that turn color in the Fall. I think, 
when I go back, that I'd like to go 
out in a rain storm and strip and 
feel the rain on my skin." 

He stopped, feeling embarrassed. 
Klein's expression was encouraging. "And then I think I'd like to 
go downtown and just watch the 
shoppers on the sidewalks. Or maybe go to a burlesque house and 
smell the cheap perfume and the 
popcorn and the people sweating in 
the dark." 

He studied his hands. "I think 
what I miss most is people — all 
kinds of people. Bad people and 
good people and fat people and 
thin people, and people I can't understand. People who wouldn't 
know an atom from an artichoke. 
And people who wouldn't give a 
damn. We're a quarter of a million 
miles from nowhere, Julius, and to 
make it literary, I think I miss my 
fellow man more than anything." 

"Got a girl back home?" Klein 
asked almost casually. 



"Yes." 

"You're not like Dahl. You've 
never mentioned it." 

"Same reason you didn't mention 
your wife. You get to thinking 
about it." 

Klein flipped the lid on the specimen box. "Going to get married 
when you get back?" 

Chapman was at the port again, 
staring out at the bleak landscape. 
"We hope to." 

"Settle down in a small cottage 
and raise lots of little Chapmans, 
eh?" 

Chapman nodded. 

"That's the only future," Klein 
said. 

He put away the box and came 
over to the port. Chapman moved 
over so they both could look out. 

"Chap." Klein hesitated a moment. "What happened to Dixon ?" 

"He died," Chapman said. "He 
was a good kid, all wrapped up in 
science. Being on the Moon was 
the opportunity of a lifetime. He 
thought so much about it that he 
forgot a lot of little things — like 
how to stay alive. The day before 
the Second group came, he went 
out to finish some work he was interested in. He forgot to check for 
leaks and whether or not the valve 
on his tank was all the way closed. 
We couldn't get to him in time." 

"He had his walkie-talkie with 
him?" 

"Yes. It worked fine, too. We 
heard everything that went through 
his mind at the end." 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



147 



Klein's face was blank. "What's 
your real job here, Chap? Why 
does somebody have to stay for 
stopover?" 

"Hell, lots of reasons, Julius. 
You can't get a whole relief crew 
and let them take over cold. They 
have to know where you left off. 
They have to know where things 
are, how things work, what to 
watch out for. And then, because 
you've been here a year and a half 
and know the ropes, you have to 
watch them to see that they stay 
alive in spite of themselves. The 
Moon's a new environment and you 
have to learn how to live in it. 
There's a lot of things to learn — 
and some people just never learn." 

"You're nursemaid, then." 

"I suppose you could call it 
that." 

KLEIN said, "You're not a scientist, are you?" 
"No, you should know that. I 
came as the pilot of the first ship. 
We made the bunker out of parts 
of the ship so there wasn't anything to go back on. I'm a good 
mechanic and I made myself useful with the machinery. When it 
occurred to us that somebody was 
going to have to stay over, I volunteered. I thbught the others were so 
important that it was better they 
should take their samples and data 
back to Earth when the first relief 
ship came." 

"You wouldn't do it again, 
though, would you?" 



"No, I wouldn't." 

"Do you think Dahl will do as 
good a job as you've done here?" 

Chapman frowned. "Frankly, I 
hadn't thought of that. I don't believe I care. I've put in my time; 
it's somebody else's turn. now. He 
volunteered for it. I think I was 
fair in explaining all about the job 
when you talked it over among 
yourselves." 

"You did, but I don't think 
Dahl's the man for it. He's too 
young, too much of a kid. He volunteered because he thought it 
made him look like a hero. He 
doesn't have the judgment that an 
older man would have. That you 
have." 

Chapman turned slowly around 
and faced Klein. 

"I'm not the indispensable man," 
he said slowly, "and even if I was, 
it wouldn't make any difference to 
me. I'm sorry if Dahl is young. So 
was I. I've lost three years up here. 
And I don't intend to lose any 
more." 

Klein held up his hands. "Look, 
Chap, I didn't mean you should 
stay. I know how much you hate 
it and the time you put in up here. 
It's just — " His voice trailed away. 
"It's just that I think it's such a 
damn important job." 

Klein had gone out in a last 
search for rock lichens and Chapman enjoyed one of his relatively 
few moments of privacy. He wandered over to his bunk and opened 
his barracks bag. He checked the 



148 




 



underwear and his toothbrush and 
shaving kit for maybe the hundredth time and pushed the clothing down farther in the canvas. It 
was foolish because the bag was already packed and had been for a 
week. He remembered stalling it 
off for as long as he could and then 
the quiet satisfaction about a week 
before, when he had opened his 
small gear locker and transferred 
its meager belongings to the bag. 

He hadn't actually needed to 
pack, of course. In less than twentyfour hours he'd be back on Earth 
where he could drown himself in 
toothpaste and buy more tee shirts 
than he could wear in a lifetime. 
He could leave behind his shorts 
and socks and the outsize shirts he 
had inherited from — who was it? 
Driesbach? — of the First group. 
Dahl could probably use them or 
maybe one of the boys in the Third. 

BUT it wasn't like going home 
unless you packed. It was part 
of the ritual, like marking off the 
last three weeks in pencil on the 
gray steel of the bulkhead beside 
his hammock. Just a few hours ago, 
when he woke up, he had made the 
last check mark and signed his 
name and the date. His signature 
was right beneath Dixon's. 

He frowned when he thought of 
Dixon and slid back the catch on 
the top of the bag and locked it. 
They should never have sent a kid 
like Dixon to the Moon. 

He had just locked the bag when 



he heard the rumble of the airlock 
and the soft hiss of air. Somebody 
had come back earlier than expected. He watched the inner door 
swing open and the spacesuited 
figure clump in and unscrew its helmet. 

Dahl. He had gone out to help 
Dowden on the Schmidt telescope. 
Maybe Dowden hadn't needed any 
help, with Bening along. Or more 
likely, considering the circumstances, Dahl wasn't much good at 
helping anybody today. 

Dahl stripped off his suit. His 
face was covered with light beads 
of sweat and his eyes were frightened. 

He moistened his lips slightly. 
"Do — do you think they'll ever 
have relief ships up here more 
often than every eighteen months, 
Chap? I mean, considering the advance of — " 

"No," Chapman interrupted 
bluntly. "I don't. Not at least for 
ten years. The fuel's too expensive 
and the trip's too hazardous. On 
freight charges alone you're worth 
your weight in platinum when they 
send you here. Even if it becomes 
cheaper, Bob, it won't come about 
so it will shorten stopover right 
away." He stopped, feeling a little 
sorry for Dahl. "It won't be too 
bad. There'll be new men up here 
and you'll pass a lot of time getting 
to know them." 

"Well, you see," Dahl started, 
"that's why I came back early. I 
wanted to see you about stopover. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



149 



It's that — well, I'll put it this way." 
He seemed to be groping for an 
easy way to say what he wanted to. 
"I'm engaged back home. Really 
nice girl, Chap, you'd like her if 
you knew her." He fumbled in his 
pocket and found a photograph and 
put it on the desk. "That's a picture 
of Alice, taken at a picnic we were 
on together." Chapman didn't look. 
"She — we — expected to be married 
when I got back. I never told her 
about stopover, Chap. She thinks 
I'll be home tomorrow. I kept 
thinking, hoping, that maybe somehow — " 

He was fumbling it badly, Chapman thought. 

"You wanted to trade places with 
me, didn't you, Bob? You thought 
I might stay for stopover again, in 
your place?" 

It hurt to look in Dahl's eyes. 
They were the eyes of a man who 
was trying desperately to stop what 
he was about to do, but just couldn't 
help himself. 



"Well, yes, more or less. Oh, 
God, Chap, I know you want to go 
home! But I couldn't ask any of 
the others; you were the only one 
who could, the only one who was 
qualified !" 

DAHL looked as though he was 
going to be sick. Chapman 
tried to recall all he knew about 
him. Dahl, Robert. Good mathematician. Graduate from one of the 
Ivy League schools. Father was a 
manufacturer of stoves or something. 

It still didn't add, not quite. 
"You know I don't like it here any 
more than you do," Chapman said 
slowly. "I may have commitments 
at home, too. What made you think 
I would change my mind?" 

Dahl took the plunge. "Well, 
you see," he started eagerly, too far 
gone to remember such a thing as 
pride, "you know my father's pretty 
well fixed. We would make it 
worth your while, Chap." He was 




150 




 



feverish. "It would mean eighteen 
more months, Chap, but they'd be 
well-paid months !" 

Chapman felt tired. The good 
feeling he had about going home 
was slowly evaporating. 

"If you have any report to make, 
I think you had better get at it," he 
cut in, keeping all the harshness he 
felt out of his voice. "It'll be too 
late after the relief ship leaves. It'll 
be easier to give the captain your 
report than try to radio it back to 
Earth from here." 

He felt sorrier for Dahl than he 
could ever remember having felt 
for anybody. Long after going' 
home, Dahl would remember this. 



It would eat at him like a cancer. 

Cowardice is the one thing for 
which no man ever forgives himself. 

DONLEY was eating a sandwich and looking out the port, 
so, naturally, he saw the ship 
first. "Well, whaddya know!" he 
shouted. "We got company!" He 
dashed for his suit. Dowden and 
Bening piled after him and all three 
started for the lock. 

Chapman was standing in front 
of it. "Check your suits," he said 
softly. "Just be sure to check." 

"Oh, what the hell, Chap!" Donley started angrily. Then he shut up 
and went over his suit. He got to 
his tank and turned white. Empty. 
It was only half a mile to the relief rocket, so somebody would 
probably have got to him in time, 
but . . . He bit his lips and got a 
full tank. 

Chapman and Klein watched 
them dash across the pumice, mak

151 



ing the tremendous leaps they used 
to read about in the Sunday supplements. The port of the rocket had 
opened and tiny figures were climbing down the ladder. The small 
figures from the bunker reached 
them and did a short jig of welcome. Then the figures linked arms 
and started back. Chapman noticed 
one — it was probably Donley — pat 
the ship affectionately before he 
started back. 

They were in the lock and the air 
pumped in and then they were in 
the bunker, taking off their suits. 
The newcomers were impressed and 
solemn, very much aware of the 
tremendous responsibility that 
rested on their shoulders. Like 
Donley and Klein and the members 
of the Second group had been when 
they had landed. Like Chapman 
had been in the First. 

Donley and the others were all 
over them. 

HOW was it back on Earth? 
Who had won the series? 
Was so-and-so still teaching at the 
university? What was the international situation? 

Was the sky still blue, was the 
grass still green, did the leaves still 
turn color in the autumn, did people still love and cry and were there 
still people who didn't know what 
an atom was and didn't give a 
damn ? 

Chapman had gone through it 
all before. But was Ginny still 
Ginny ? 



Some of the men in the Third 
had their luggage with them. One 
of them — a husky, red-faced kid 
named Williams — was opening a 
box about a foot square and six 
inches deep. Chapman watched him 
curiously. 

"Well, I'll be damned!" Klein 
said. "Hey, guys, look what we've 
got here!" 

Chapman and the others crowded 
around and suddenly Donley leaned 
over and took a deep breath. In the 
box, covering a thick layer of ordinary dirt, was a plot of grass. They 
looked at it, awed. Klein put out 
his hand and laid it on top of the 
grass. 

"I like the feel of it," he said 
simply. 

Chapman cut off a single blade 
with his fingernail and put it between his lips. It had been years 
since he had seen grass and had the 
luxury of walking on it and lying 
on its cool thickness during those 
sultry summer nights when it was 
too hot to sleep indoors. 

Williams blushed. "I thought we 
could spare a little water for it and 
maybe use the ultraviolet lamp on 
it some of the time. Couldn't help 
but bring it along; it se'emed sort 
of like a symbol . . ." He looked 
embarrassed. 

Chapman sympathized. If he had 
had any sense, he'd have tried to 
smuggle something like that up to 
the Moon instead of his phonograph. 

"That's valuable grass," Dahl 
said sharply. "Do you realize that 
at current freight rates up here, it's 
worth about ten dollars a blade?" 

Williams looked stricken and 
somebody said, "Oh, shut up, 
Dahl." 

One of the men separated from 
the group and came over to Chapman. He held out his hand and 
said, "My name's Eberlein. Captain 
of the relief ship. I understand 
you're in charge here?" 

Chapman nodded and shook 
hands. They hadn't had a captain 
on the First ship. Just a pilot and 
crew. Eberlein looked every inch a" 
captain, too. Craggy face, gray hair, 
the firm chin of a man who was 
sure of himself. 

"You might say I'm in charge 
here," Chapman said. 

"Well, look, Mr. Chapman, is 
there any place where we can talk 
together privately?" 

They walked over to one corner 
of the bunker. "This is about as 
private as we can get, captain," 
Chapman said. "What's on your 
mind?" 

EBERLEIN found a packing 
crate and made himself comfortable. He looked at Chapman. 

"I've always wanted to meet the 
man who's spent more time here 
than anybody else," he began. 

"I'm sure you wanted to see me 
for more reasons than just curiosity" 

Eberlein took out a pack of cigar 
rets. "Mind if I smoke?" 



Chapman jerked a thumb toward Dahl. "Ask him. He's in 
charge now." 

The captain didn't bother. He 
put the pack away. "You know we 
have big plans for the station," he 
said. 

"I hadn't heard of them." 

"Oh, yes, big plans. They're 
working on unmanned, open-side 
rockets now that could carry cargo 
and sheet steel for more bunkers 
like this. Enable us to enlarge the 
unit, have a series of bunkers all 
linked together. Make good laboratories and living quarters for you 
people." His eyes swept the room. 
"Have a little privacy for a change." 

Chapman nodded. "They could 
use a little privacy up here." 

The captain noticed the pronoun. 
"Well, that's one of the reasons 
why I wanted to talk to you, Chapman. The Commission talked it 
over and they'd like to see you stay. 
They feel if they're going to enlarge it, add more bunkers and 
have more men up here, that a man 
of practical experience should be 
running things. They figure that 
you're the only man who's capable 
and who's had the experience." 

The captain vaguely felt the approach was all wrong. 

"Is that all?" 

Eberlein was ill at ease. "Naturally you'd be paid well. I don't 
imagine any man would like being 
here all the time. They're prepared 
to double your salary — maybe even 
a bonus in addition — and let you

have full charge. You'd be Director 
of the Luna Laboratories." 

All this and a title too, Chapman 
thought. 

"That's it?" Chapman asked. 

Eberlein frowned. "Well, the 
Commission said they'd be willing 
to consider anything else you had 
in mind, if it was more money 
or ..." 

"The answer is no," Chapman 
said. "I'm not interested in more 
money for staying because I'm not 
interested in staying. Money can't 
buy it, captain. I'm sorry, but I'm 
afraid that you'd have to stay up 
here to appreciate that. 

"Bob Dahl is staying for stopover. If there's something important about the project or impending 
changes, perhaps you'd better tell 
him before you go." 

He walked away. 

CHAPMAN held the letter in 
both hands, but the paper still 
shook. The others had left the 
bunker, the men of the Second taking those of the Third in hand to 
show them the machinery and apparatus that was outside, point out 
the deadly blisters underneath the 
pumice covering, and show them 
how to keep out of the Sun and 
how to watch their air supply. 

He was glad he was alone. He 
felt something trickle down his face 
and tasted salt on his lips. 

The mail had been distributed 
and he had saved his latest letter 
until the others had left so he could 



read it in privacy. It was a short 
letter, very short. 

It started: "Dear Joel: This isn't 
going to be a nice letter, but I 
thought it best that you should 
know before you came home." 

There was more to it, but he 
hadn't even needed to read it to 
know what it said. It wasn't original, of course. Women who 
change their minds weren't exactly an innovation, either. 

He crumpled the paper and held 
a match to it and watched it burn 
on the steel floor. 

Three years had been a long 
time. It was too long a time to 
keep loving a man who was a quarter of a million miles away. She 
could look up in the night sky 
when she was out with somebody 
else now and tell him how she had 
once been engaged to the Man in 
the Moon. 

It would make good conversation. 
It would be funny. A joke. 

He got up and walked over to 
his phonograph and put the record 
on. The somewhat scratchy voice 
sang as if nothing had happened. 

The home food's the spreadiest, 
The old wine's the_ headiest, 
The old pals the readiest, 
The home gal's the steadiest, 
The love the liveliest, 
The life the loveliest, 
Way back home. 

The record caught and started 
repeating the last line. 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



155 



He hadn't actually wanted to play 
it. It had been an automatic response. He had played it lots of 
times before when he had thought 
of Earth. Of going home. 

He crossed over and threw the 
record across the bunker and 
watched it shatter on the steel wall 
and the pieces fall to the floor. 

The others came back in the 
bunker and the men of the Second 
started grabbing their bags and 
few belongings and getting ready 
to leave. Dahl sat in a corner, a 
peculiar expression on his face. He 
looked as if he wanted to cry and 
yet still felt that the occasion was 
one for rejoicing. 

Chapman walked over to him. 
"Get your stuff and leave with the 
others, Dahl." His voice was quiet 
and hard. 

Dahl looked up, opened his 
mouth to say something, and then 
shut up. Donley and Bening and 
Dowden were already in the airlock, ready to leave. Klein caught 
the conversation and came over. He 
gripped Chapman's arm. 

"What the hell's going on, 
Chap? Get your bag and let's go. 
I know just the bistro to throw a 
whing-ding when we get — " 

"I'm not going back," Chapman 
said. 

Klein looked annoyed, not believing him. "Come on, what's the matter with you? You suddenly decide you don't like the blue sky and 
trees and stuff? Let's go!" 

The men in the lock were looking 



at them questioningly. Some members of the Third looked embarrassed, like outsiders caught in a 
family argument. 

"Look, Julius, I'm not going 
back," Chapman repeated dully. "I 
haven't anything to go back for." 

"You're doing a much braver 
thing than you may think," a voice 
cut in. It belonged to Eberlein. 

Chapman looked at him. Eberlein flushed, then turned and 
walked-stiffly to the lock to join the 
others. 

Just before the inner door of the 
lock shut, they could hear Chapman, his hands on his hips, break: 
ing in the Third on how to be 
happy and stay healthy on the 
Moon. His voice was ragged and 
strained and sounded like a topsergeant's. 

DAHL and Eberlein stood in the 
outer port of the relief ship, 
staring back at the research bunker. 
It was half hidden in the shadows 
of a rocky overhang that protected 
it from meteorites. 

"They kidded him a lot this 
morning," Dahl said. "They said 
he had found a home on the 
Moon." J 

"If we had stayed an hour or so 
more, he might have changed his 
mind and left, after all," Eberlein 
mused, his face a thoughtful mask 
behind his air helmet. 

"I offered him money," Dahl 
said painfully. "I was a coward and 
I offered him money to stay in my 
place." His face was bitter and 
full of disgust for himself. 

Eberlein turned to him quickly 
and automatically told him the 
right thing. 

"We're all cowards once in a 
while," he said earnestly. "But your 
offer of money had nothing to do 
with his staying. He stayed because 
he had to stay, because we made 
him stay." 

"I don't understand," Dahl said. 

"Chapman had a lot to go home 
for. He was engaged to be married." Dahl winced. "We got her 
to write him a letter breaking it off. 
We knew it meant that he lost one 
of his main reasons for wanting to 
go back. I think, perhaps, that he 
still would have left if we had 
stayed and argued him into going. 
But we left before he could change 
his mind." 

"That — was a lousy thing to do!" 

"We had no choice. We didn't 
use it except as a last resort." 

"I don't know of any girl who 
would have done such a thing, no 
matter what your reasons, if she 
was in love with a guy like Chapman," Dahl said. 

"There was only one who would 
have," Eberlein agreed. "Ginny 
Dixon. She understood what we 
were trying to tell her. She had to; 
her brother had died up here." 

"Why was Chapman so important?" Dahl burst out. "What could 
he have done that I couldn't have 
done — would have done if I had 
had any guts?" 



"Perhaps you could have," Eberlein said. "But I doubt it. I don't 
think there were many men who 
could have. And we couldn't take 
the chance. Chapman knows how 
to live on the Moon. He's like a 
trapper who's spent all his time in 
the forests and knows it like the 
palm of his hand. He never makes 
mistakes, he never fails to check 
things. And he isn't a scientist. He 
would never become so preoccupied 
with research that he'd fail to make 
checks. And he can watch out for 
those who do make mistakes. Ginny 
understood that all too well." 

"How did you know all this 
about Chapman?" Dahl asked. 

"The men in the First told us 
some of it. And we had our own 
observer with you here. Bening 
kept us pretty well informed." 

TjlBERLEIN stared at the bunker 
-Hi thoughtfully. 

"It costs a lot of money to send 
ships up here and establish a colony. It will cost a lot to expand it. 
And with that kind of investment, 
you don't take chances. You have 
to have the best men for the job. 
You get them even if they don't 
want to do it." 

He gestured at the small, blotchy 
globe of blue and green that was 
the Earth, riding high in the black 
sky. 

"You remember what it was like 
five years ago, Dahl? Nations at 
each other's throats, re-arming to 
the teeth? It isn't that way now. 



158 




 



We've got the one lead that nobody 
can duplicate or catch up on. Nobody has our technical background. 
I know, this isn't a military base. 
But it could become one." 
He paused. 

"But these aren't even the most 
important reasons, Dahl. We're at 
the beginnings of space travel, the 
first bare, feeble start. If this base 
on the Moon succeeds, the whole 
human race will be Outward 
Bound." He waved at the stars. 
"You have your choice — a frontier 
that lies in the stars, or a psychotic 
little world that tries and fails 
and spends its time and talents trying to find better methods of suicide. 

"With a choice like that, Dahl, 
you can't let it fail. And personal 
lives and viewpoints are expendable. But it's got to be that way. 
There's too much at stake." 

Eberlein hesitated a moment and 
when he started again, it was on a 
different track. "You're an odd 
bunch of guys, you and the others 
in the groups, Dahl. Damn few of 
you come up for the glamor, I 
know. None of you like it and none 
of you are really enthusiastic about 
it. You were all reluctant to come 
in the first place, for the most part. 
You're a bunch of pretty reluctant 
heroes, Dahl." 

The captain nodded soberly at 
the bunker. "I, personally, don't 
feel happy about that. I don't like 
having to mess up other people's 
lives. I hope I won't have to again. 



Maybe somehow, someway, this one 
can be patched up. We'll try to." 

He started the mechanism that 
closed the port of the rocket. His 
face was a study of regret and helplessness. He was thinking of a future that, despite what he had told 
Dahl, wasn't quite real to him. 

"I feel like a cheap son of a 
bitch," Eberlein said. 

HPHE very young man said, "Do 
* they actually care where they 
send us? Do they actually care what 
we think?" 

The older man got up and 
walked to the window. The bunkers 
and towers and squat buildings of 
the research colony glinted in the 
sunlight. The colony had come a 
long way; it housed several thousands now. 

The Sun was just rising for the 
long morning and farther down 
shadows stabbed across the crater 
floor. Tycho was by far the most 
beautiful of the craters, he thought. 

It was nice to know that the very 
young man was going to miss it. It 
had taken the older man quite a 
long time to get to like it. But that 
was to be expected — he hadn't been 
on the Moon. 

"I would say so," he said. "They 
were cruel, that way, at the start. 
But then they had to be. The goal 
was too important. And they made 
up for it as soon as they could. It 
didn't take them too long to remember the men who had traded 
their future for the stars." 



THE RELUCTANT HEROES 



159 



The very young man said, "Did 
you actually think of it that way 
when you first came up here?" 

The older man thought for a 
minute. "No," he admitted. "No, 
we didn't. Most of us were strictly 
play-for-pay men. The Commission 
wanted men who wouldn't fall 
apart when the glamor wore off 
and there was nothing left but privation and hard work and loneliness. The men who fell for the 
glamor were all right for quick 
trips, but not for an eighteen-month 
stay in a research bunker. So the 
Commission offered high salaries 
and we reluctantly look the jobs. 
"Oh, there was the idea behind 
the project, the vision the Commission had in mind. But it took a 
while for that to grow." 

A woman came in the room just 
then, bearing a tray with glasses on 
it. The older man took one and 
said, "Your mother and I were 
notified yesterday that you had been 
chosen to go. We ivould like to see 
you go, but of course the final decision is up to you." 

He sipped his drink and turned 
to his wife: "It has its privations, 
but in the long run we've never regretted it, have we, Ginny?"
