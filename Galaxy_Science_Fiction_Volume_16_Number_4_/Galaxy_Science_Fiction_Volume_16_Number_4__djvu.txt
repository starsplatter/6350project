HOW TO GET AROUND 
ON OTHER PLANETS 

By WILLY LEY 

THE year will be around 
1985 aj>. 
Captain Sixtus E. Boyle, 
assisted by Navigator Roderich 
Meerschaum, has just put his ship 
down at latitude 6° 15' S. on 
Mars. What do they do next? 

Before landing, they had orbited 
Mars for several days in order to 
take detailed pictures of the sur- 
face in the equatorial regions so 

73 



that they could decide on a suit- 
able spot for landing. The general 
instructions which they carried 
both on perma-paper and in their 
heads had been somewhat vague 
about the landing itself. They 
merely stated that the landing 
should be made near the Martian 
equator for reasons of tempera- 
tures. 

Near the equator, one could ex- 
pect reasonable temperatures dur- 
ing the day. The nights would be 
extremely cold, but that could not 
be helped. Far from the equator, 
it would be cold around the clock. 
In addition to the order to land 
near the equator, the instructions 
merely said that, "of course," the 
landing place should be "in the 
proximity of interesting forma- 
tions." Captain Boyle finally found 
a spot on the photographs which 
looked like smooth desert with a 
ridge of fairly high hills (rare on 
Mars) not too far away. There 
is also a "canal" nearby. On the 
pictures taken from the orbit 
around Mars, the formation did 
not look like a "canal," nor like 
anything else for which there was 
an established name. 

But the charts drawn from a 
long distance - Earth, that is - in- 
sisted that it was a canal. Hence 
it was something to be investigated. 
Now the ship sits on the desert 
sand, undamaged. The ridge of 
hills is to the north, clearly visible, 
and it looks as if it were about five 

74 



miles away. And the "canal," what- 
ever it really is, must be to the 
east. It is not visible from the ship, 
but if they hit anywhere near the 
intended spot, it would be about 
twenty miles away. 

The captain decides that one 
does not explore well on an empty 
stomach, so the crew eats first. 
There is a rest period of several 
hours, mostly for the purpose of 
getting used to gravity again. Then 
the captains assign watches and 
two men break out the ground 
car. 

LETS come back from the fu- 
ture and think about that 
ground car for Mars. How would 
you design ground transportation 
for such different conditions? 

But the first question might well 
be whether you really need a 
ground car. Whafs wrong with 
walking? 

Of course one could walk on 

Mars. 

As has been mentioned, the day- 
time temperatures near the Mar- 
tian equator are bearable, even if 
highly extreme. In the morning, 
say, one hour after sunrise, it is 
still about forty below zero. An 
hour after noon, it is around seven- 
ty above zero. The tropics of Mars 
might better be called its "intem- 
perate zone," but they do not rep- 
resent an impossible situation. Our 
own highland of Tibet is very 
nearly as bad; the temperature 


 



does not go so low there during 
the night, but it climbs to around 
a hundred in daytime when the 
season is right 

Air pressure is a somewhat dif- 
ferent story. The Martian atmos- 
phere, near the ground, has rough- 
ly the same pressure as our own 
atmosphere eleven miles up. This 
calls for a pressure suit, especially 
since the oxygen content seems to 
be near zero. Even if it were all 
oxygen, a man could not breathe 
at such a low pressure. The incon- 
venience of the pressure suit is 
more than compensated by the low 
gravity — a man will weigh pre- 
cisely 38 per cent of what he 
weighs on Earth. Which means 
that even a heavy suit, with oxygen 
bottles on the back and all kinds 
of hand tools dangling from the 
belt, will not produce full Earth 
weight for the explorer. 

So one could walk and the men 
will do it for short distances. But, 
for exploration, ground transpor- 
tation of some kind is needed. 
Specimens will have to be car- 
ried to the ship. Even if they are 
not heavy, they might be awk- 
ward to handle. 

The design of any kind of 
ground transportation is chiefly 
influenced by the nature of the 
ground. On Mars, there may be 
rocky ground in many places, 
rather rough. Much of it must be 
sandy desert. And in those areas 
which look dark when seen from 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



Earth, there are likely to be salty 
marshes. For all these types of 
ground, wheels are not practical. 

HP HE first alternative that al- 
x ways occurs to everybody, 
when wheels won't do, is the cater- 
pillar tread. But it has its limita- 
tions too, and for Mars the best 
bet is indubitably the so-called 
"rolligon" - the barrel-shaped in- 
flated pillows developed for similar 
conditions on Earth. 

Rolligons produce fine traction 
on sand and do not sink in. They 
can tolerate very rough rocky 
ground and don't shake up the 
driver in the process. They do well 
in marshes, and if the water should 
be too deep, they will float. They 
could be inflated on the spot with 
Martian atmosphere. It would 
take some time because the atmos- 
phere is so thin, but it can be com- 
pressed. 

The question of engine power is 
somewhat more complicated. It 
must not need air, for we have to 
go on the assumption that Mar- 
tian air will not sustain combus- 
tion, even when compressed to 
what we consider normal density. 
Right now we know three types 
of non-air-breathing engines. They 
are (1) the rocket, (2) the elec- 
tric motor and (3) the atomic 
reactor. 

Rocket power is useless for the 
conditions in question, because the 
ground vehicles must be able to

move very slowly, which is the 
one thing the rocket cannot do, at 
least not efficiently. The electric 
motor could provide almost any 
speed range desired, but it needs 
electric current. Of course, one 
might say that between 1958 and 
1985 somebody may invent an in- 
credibly efficient kind of storage 
battery. This is possible, but no- 
body can promise that somebody 
else will. 

As regards atomic reactors, we 
can't really tell. Maybe it can be 
built small enough and light 
enough in time, but it would be 
hard to say when, and impossible 
to tell what other complications 

76 



might go with a small reactor. 

It was pointed out several years 
ago — by Wernher von Braun — 
that a ground car for an airless 
planet or a planet with oxygen- 
less atmosphere could be turbine- 
powered, provided you pick the 
right fuel for the turbine. The right 
fuel would be hydrogen peroxide, 
H 2 2 . At ordinary temperatures, 
hydrogen peroxide is a liquid and 
it is quite safe if pure, or rather if 
it does not contain any other im- 
purities than water. When hydrogen 
peroxide is decomposed, the reaction 
proceeds according to the formula 

2 H 2 2 * 2 H 2 + 2

It produces water and free oxy- 
gen. It also produces, which the 
equations fails to show, a large 
amount of heat. Hence the water 
appears in the form of steam, so 
that the product is a mixture of 
steam and hot oxygen. If there 
was water present in the hydrogen 
peroxide, this water is naturally 
heated into steam too. 

Tj^OR 80 per cent hydrogen per- 
-*- oxide (the other 20 per cent be- 
ing water), all the water, both the 
20 per cent present and the water 
formed by the decomposition, will 
appear as steam with a tempera- 
ture of 870 degrees Fahrenheit. 
This steam can turn a turbine 
wheel. After it has passed through 
the turbine wheel, the steam will 
be too cool and too weak to do 
additional work. 

But the free oxygen that was 
formed by the decomposition and 
which is mixed with the steam has 
not done any work worth men- 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



tioning. So far, it has only in- 
creased the bulk somewhat. So, 
when it emerges from the turbine 
wheel, the steam-oxygen mixture 
enters a combustion chamber 
where some ordinary fuel like 
gasoline is injected. After it has 
burned, there is now a mixture of 
hot carbon dioxide from the com- 
bustion and reheated steam. This 
can drive a second turbine wheel. 

You have here what is known 
as a two-stage turbine which is 
not air-breathing, hence the ideal 
power plant for ground vehicles 
on airless or oxygenless planets. 

But by the time an expedition 
sets out for Mars, there will be an 
establishment of some sort on the 
Moon. Conditions on the surface 
of the Moon are like those on 
Mars, with much exaggeration. 

Where Mars has a thin atmos- 
phere, the Moon has just traces of 
gases, argon and so forth. (When 
I say traces, I mean rraces, not 
just a highly attenuated gas.) 
Where Mars cools off to an esti- 
mated seventy degrees below zero 
during the night, the Moon cools 
to an estimated one hundred de- 
grees below zero during its night 
— if a night lasts two weeks, Earth 
time, the surface obviously has a 
better chance to radiate what heat 
it has into space. Likewise, the two- 
week day produces higher tem- 
peratures as it wears on slowly. 
Near the Moon's equator, the 
temperature of the surface rock 

77 




Fig. 3: Moon car 



climbs to beyond the boiling point 
of water after a week of sunshine. 

As for condition of the lunar 
surface, one can only say that it 
is not Earthlike. The old ideas 
about the rock cracking into splin- 
ters because of the large tempera- 
ture span between day and night 
have been abandoned. Laboratory 
experiments have shown that rock 
will not crack if heated and cooled 
as slowly as in the course of a full 
lunar day. 

But the rock is being pounded 
by meteorites of all sizes. Meteo- 
rites of a size that form craters 
visible from Earth are naturally 
rare. But cosmic dust grains are 

78 



very frequent. Each dust grain 
hitting lunar rock will produce 
several other dust grains. The cos- 
mic rays join in this work; they 
can, and in time will, break up 
the crystalline structure of the 
rock. 

THE overall result of these 
forces, acting over several mil- 
lion years of time, must be sharp 
rocks on the one hand and a layer 
of dust on the other. On an ex- 
posed vertical or very steep rock 
surface, the action of dust forma- 
tion must be continuous, since the 
rock flakes and dust produced will 
simply fall off and settle on the 


 



ground. On a flat area, however, 
the process must be self-limiting, 
because the dust formed will pro- 
tect the rock underneath against 
further meteorite and cosmic ray 
impacts. 

The question is how far the dust- 
forming process can be carried be- 
fore the dust becomes a protection. 
In the case of tiny metorites, 
roughly speaking of the size of 
sand grains, half an inch of dust 
will obviously be enough; the force 
of a new impact will not be car- 
ried through such a layer, but will 
be dissipated by throwing some 
of the existing dust around. Cos- 
mic rays could easily penetrate a 
half-inch layer of dust, however, 
and continue the process of the 
destruction of the rock. But this 
process must be self-limiting too, 



except that the required dust layer 
would have to be thicker. 

The general consensus right now 
is that the average depth of a dust 
layer might be about an inch, but 
that in some places a much deeper 
accumulation is easily possible. If 
dust is fine enough, it will behave 
more or less like water, and the 
English astronomer Thomas Gold 
- now in the United States — has 
suggested that the smoothness of 
the Moon's maria is due to such 
a dust accumulation; the maria 
might be just large depressions 
filled with dust. 

The lunar surface, then, must 
be rocky with a dust layer on top, 
with possible accumulations of dust 
of great depth. 

The two-stage hydrogen per- 
oxide turbine would work on the

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



79 




Fig. 5: Prototype of Gyrobus under construction 






Moon too; the problem is what 
shape to give to the car. Most 
people who had to think about 
this problem — the first probably 
were illustrators of science fiction 
magazines — have simply settled 
for a tank as the most likely shape. 
Caterpillar treads can negotiate 
any kind of ground except ground 
that is very soft They do not slip 
easily on gravel and can take con- 
siderable inclines. 

But so can rolligons, and if there 
are such dust-filled depressions, the 
rolligons would be safer. If a tank 
shape is picked, it might be prac- 
tical to have a tank push an ordi- 
nary heavy wheel ahead of itself 
on a boom. This would show 
where the ground is treacherous. 

Another likely shape for a Moon 
car would be a vehicle which 

80 



simply has four wheels, but very 
large wheels, at least fifteen feet 
in diameter, with spiked rims. Such 
a vehicle could make much better 
speed on flat ground, and because 
of the large size of the wheels, 
there would be a high clearance 
between the body of the car and 
the ground, which would permit 
the passing of obstacles where a 
tank would have to lurch and 
clamber. 

IT is very likely that every Moon 
car would have to carry a 
sheet metal "shield" on vertical 
booms above its body. 

This shield would, in the first 
place, be a protection against too 
much sunlight. Since the Moon 
lacks anything that could reason- 
ably be called an atmosphere, the 


 



sunlight beating down on the lunar 
plains will be about three times as 
powerful as the tropical Sun on a 
clear day on Earth. 

In the second place, the shield 
would protect the body of the car 
against the fairly frequent dust 
particles coming from space with 
an average velocity of forty miles 
per second. They would cover the 
shield with nearly microscopic pits 
in the course of time, but they 
would not penetrate. 

But if there is a permanent 
base of some kind on the Moon, 
electricity would be a possible 
source of power for the Moon cars 
in the vicinity of the vase. The 
base would have an atomic reactor, 
a stationary power plant, for its 
own needs. Ground cars staying 
close to the base could run on re- 
chargeable batteries. 

The problem is that rechargeable 
batteries must not be exposed to a 
vacuum; they have to be pres- 



surized - that is, they must be 
located in the interior of the Moon 
car. This might be inconvenient, 
to say the least, and the designers 
therefore are likely to fall back 
on a trick used in Switzerland a 
few years ago. 

Engineers of the Swiss firm of 
Oerlikon, at Oerlikon, near Zurich, 
built an experimental bus with a 
capacity of two dozen passengers. 
The wheels of this bus were driven 
by an ordinary three-phase elec- 
tric motor, but the current for the 
motor was not supplied by either 
overhead wire or by batteries. The 
energy was stored in a one-ton 
flywheel, measuring six feet in 
diameter and mounted in a hori- 
zontal position under the floor of 
the bus. 

To reduce friction, the Swiss en- 
gineers ran the flywheel in a sealed 
casing in a hydrogen atmosphere, 
but this is a minor point. 

A second three-phase motor was

mounted on the flywheel shaft, and 
at the terminal, this motor brought 
the flywheel up to 3000 revolu- 
tions per minute, drawing current 
from the net. When disconnected 
from the net, this motor became 
the generator, drawing mechanical 
energy from the flywheel and sup- 
plying electric current to the drive 
motor. 

After six miles of stop-and-go 
driving with a full passenger load, 
the flywheel had run down to 1500 
revolutions per minute. It then 
needed recharging, which could 
be done by means of power out- 
lets near passenger stops. The re- 
charging topk two minutes. Then 
the bus was ready for another six- 
mile run. 

With a stationary power plant 
for the Moon base, such flywheel- 
driven vehicles would be very 



practical for routine runs on the 
lunar surface. If there are a num- 
ber of routine stops - say, lunar 
base, space port, astronomical ob- 
servatory and so forth — cables 
could be laid to those points from 
the power plant, with intermediate 
recharging points where necessary. 
The problem of getting around 
on other planets bears much re- 
semblance to quite a number of 
other detail problems in space 
travel. Engineers have very defi- 
nite ideas of how these problems 
could be solved. They could even 
build their solutions right now. 

But these solutions are not 
needed here on Earth. They are 
needed at the other end of the 

trip. 

And the first problem is to get 
to the other end of the trip.

THE TROUBLE WITH 

ELMO 

By DANIEL KEYES 

Said trouble being that Elmo 
had to live by his wits — and 
the one man who could outwit 
him couldn't do it wittingly! 



? ?rir! HE tr ouble with Elmo," The thin, weary-looking private, 

shouted Senator Ferdus, haggard from lack of sleep, checked 

JL as Private Busby helped his controls and then peered 

him up into the copter, "is that he through the early morning mist at

ate it, Busby. Elmo has been pull- 
ing this for years just to excuse 
his staying alive. It won't do, Bus- 
by. It's blackmail. And I'm warn- 
ing you that it's your job to—" 
The Senator paused as he looked 
around him. "Busby! Why aren't 
we off the ground?" 

Private Busby pointed to the 
flickering red light on the control 
panel. "Waiting for an automatic 
beam to the other side of the Poto- 
mac." 

"Busby, this is an emergency! 
For all I know, that mechanical 
monster is creating a new crisis at 
this very moment. Forget about 
the automatic. You can fly this 
thing without—" 

Busby took a deep breath and 
flicked the manual control switch, 
lifting the copter so quickly that 
the Senator lost the rest of his 
sentence. He glared suspiciously, 
waggled a fat but threatening 
finger. "Busby, I suspect you're 
on Elmo's side." 

All the way to Computer Base, 
the Senator hammered away. 
"Mark my words, Busby. The peo- 
ple will not stand for the idea of 
spending twenty millions a year 
to service an Electronic Monitor 
that served its purpose more than 
fifteen years ago. You'd better 
come through with a demolition 
job this time. Not in twenty or 
thirty years, when Elmo decides 
he's ready, but now, Busby, now! 
Otherwise, I'm afraid I'll have to 



recommend and insist upon your 
demotion." 

JAKE Busby sighed, glanced 
down at the stitch marks that 
formed a chevron-shaped scar on 
his sleeve. 

"Senator," he said, "fifteen years 
ago, when they assigned me to the 
Computer Demolition Squad, I 
was a master sergeant with a good 
record. And then the President is- 
sues the order to dismantle Elmo. 
The Secretary of Cybernetics 
hands it to the General of the 
Army, and down it comes through 
the old chain of command. Gen- 
erals, colonels, majors, until — 
where does it end up? Right here 
in the lap of Jake Busby. 

"And since then, Senator, I've 
had my ratings taken away from 
me, stripe by stripe, by every of- 
ficer who blames me for not get- 
ting his promotion. Senator—" Bus- 
by settled back and lit one of his 
favorite cigars, calmer now— "Fm 
sorry, but I've got no more stripes 
to give." 

"What did you do before you 
volunteered to serve your coun- 
try?" 

"I didn't volunteer, Senator. I 
was drafted. Before that, I ran a 
little business of my own. Busby's 
Fixit Shop. And I used to go from 
house to house to find out if people 
needed anything fixed or—" 

"How old are you, Busby?" 

"Forty-six, Senator. And I had 



84 




 



this shop of mine all fitted out 
with lathes and—" 

"Then will you tell me," snapped 
the Senator, "why the Army's best 
computer technician, after twenty- 
two years in uniform and fifteen 
years of study and preparation, 
can't get Elmo dismantled? My 
boy, don't you see what you're 
doing to your military career?" 

"Senator, I go through this every 
few years, but I'll say it again: 
Elmo was built to solve the world's 
major problems, and he can't let 
himself be dismantled until he's 
finished the job. Now you've got to 
admit that this cobalt radiation in 
the atmosphere was a threat to 
human survival." 

"You know as well as I do, Bus- 
by—as well as any sixth-grade 
child knows by now — that Elmo 
caused the cobalt radiation in the 
first place." 

Busby hunched angrily over the 
controls and stared ahead as he 
chewed his cigar. "The cobalt 
radiation was a byproduct of the 
solution to the world-famine threat. 
If not for Elmo-" 

"If not for your Elmo," shouted 
the Senator, "there would have 
been no famine in the first place! 
It was a result of his solution to the 
storm cycle that he created to 
solve the problem of the five-year 
drought. Your Elmo solves one 
problem by creating a new one, 
just to keep us from putting him 
out of business. Well, you'd better 



make certain that this new solu- 
tion to the cobalt radiation hasn't 
created any new problems. Other- 
wise, Busby, if they can't break 
you any lower than a private, I'll 
see that you're court-martialed." 

"But thafs not fair! Is it my 
Computer? Why do I have to be 
the goat? For crying out loud, 
I didn't build him!" 

Senator Ferdus shrugged his 
shoulders and clasped his hands 
across his huge stomach. It was a 
final movement, like the passing of 
judgment. "Busby, the people are 
crying for blood. If it's necessary, 
yours will have to do." 

Busby stared at his cigar, 
chewed to shreds the way it al- 
ways was when he became upset. 
As they approached Computer 
Base, the dreadful question pound- 
ed into his mind as it had during 
all these months of waiting. Elmo 
had solved the radiation problem. 
What would the new problem be? 

FROM the air, the building 
■■- housing Elmo at its center 
looked like a flat oval — the out- 
line shape of an egg. There, two 
hundred feet below ground level, 
the Electronic Monitor (known as 
Elmo for short) worked away at 
solving the problems of mankind. 
Busby lowered the copter gently 
— like a giant spider at the end 
of an invisible thread — to the 
roofport cradle. 

He wouldn't be in this mess 



THE TRjOUBLE WITH ELMO 



85 



now, thought Busby, if they had 
let him out of the Army when his 
hitch was up. When it was discov- 
ered he had been trained for the 
special job of dismantling Elmo, 
someone declared him essential to 
the national defense. His discharge 
was pigeonholed and he was as- 
signed to demolition duty at Com- 
puter Base. 

He remembered his first years 
as an aide to the scientists who 
built Elmo. Under their instruc- 
tion, he got to know Elmo and be- 
came more interested in learning 
how an Electronic Monitor worked. 
He serviced Elmo's parts with the 
loving care that a boy bestows on 
his first jalopy. He polished and 
oiled and tightened. And by the 
time the last of the scientists died, 
Busby knew more about Elmo 
than any man alive. 

And of course there were the 
feelings of guilt as he waited for 
Elmo to outlive his usefulness, 
waited for the final problem to be 
solved so he could perform his 
duty — as executioner. Thinking 
about that now, he caught himself 
up short. As much as he loved 
Elmo, he couldn't deny the pecul- 
iar problems that were so unex- 
pected and suspicious. If Elmo was 
really creating them, as some peo- 
ple said, to stay alive, then Elmo 
was a menace. 

Inside the central vault, the 
Senator strode up and down with 
his hands clasped behind his back 



while he surveyed his electronic 
nemesis. "All right, Busby, let's get 
to it. I want to know exactly how 
Elmo has solved this problem. 
And then I want you to get right 
to work on the demolition job. 
Unless he's pulled another fast one. 
And if he has, by gad—" 

"Oh, shut up!" It came out with- 
out Busby realizing it, but sud- 
denly he was glad he said it. 

Senator Ferdus' mouth dropped 
open and he stared with bulging 
eyes beneath his thick white eye- 
brows. "I— I— how dare—" 

Busby swallowed and decided 
that, for once in his life, he would 
go all the way. "Now listen, Sena- 
tor. Outside this control room, you 
may be a big shot as the duly 
elected representative of suckers 
from Idaho, but down here you're 
just my guest. I'm the only per- 
son who has unlimited clearance 
— even the President accepts that. 
If you keep your mouth shut, you 
can stay. If not, I'll have to see 
that you're escorted off Computer 
Base. As I mentioned before, Sen- 
ator," he added, pointing to the 
stitch marks on his sleeve, "I have 
nothing to lose." 

IKE a gulping fish, the Senator 
■■^ opened and closed his mouth, 
finally shut it without saying any- 
thing. The transformation in Bus- 
by's behavior was unmistakable; 
here he was undisputed authority. 
The Senator nodded a bright red 



86 




 



face and seated himself in a near- 
by chair. 

"Good, Senator. We understand 
each other. Now let's find out 
what this is all about." Busby 
reached over and threw the kine- 
scope tape-key that would present 
Elmo's verbal and visual report. 

In the midst of the semi-circu- 
lar arc of computer banks, a video 
screen flashed into blinding white- 
ness. On both sides of this screen, 
oscilloscopes traced the electrical 
waves of sound. The voice boomed 
out, deep, hollow, clear. Elmo's 
bass was slightly metallic, but to 
Busby it had the familiar tone of 
a friend. 

"— in answer to your move, 
Knight to Queen four, I move 
Bishop to Bishop five, check—" 
The video, now in focus, showed 
a closeup of Busby straining, deep 
in thought, over a chessboard. 

Busby fumbled with the tape- 
key. He had gone too far bapk on 
the kinescope recording. From the 
accusing look on the Senator's 
face, Busby knew he would have a 
hard time explaining to a Senate 
investigating committee why he 
used a multi-billion-dollar Elec- 
tronic Monitor as a chess com- 
panion. 

Silently cursing himself, he 
found the position on the tapes 
that indicated the exact time he 
left the control room to pick up 
the Senator. Why hadn't he re- 
membered to erase the chess-play- 



ing tapes as he always did? It was 
too late now. The Senator was 
making notes in his memo book. 

"Here we are," said Busby, try- 
ing to appear lighthearted. "Now 
we'll find out whaf s going on." 

At first there was no sound, 
and the video showed only the 
usual scanning of the various parts 
of the world. Then the picture 
halted and closed in on the scene 
of an open meadow just half a 
mile south of Computer Base. 
There appeared a circle of shim- 
mering orange light, like a spot- 
light, against the background of 
the uncut grass. 

The Senator leaned forward. 
"What's that?" 

Before Busby could say he had 
no idea, they were confronted with 
the materialization of an enor- 
mous silver object that resembled 
an early twentieth-century gas-fuel 
tank. Peculiarly, this was crated 
with glowing yellow bands of un- 
dulating ribbonlike substance tied 
into a giant bow. 

Then a second appeared along- 
side the first. 

"Seems to be a tank of some 
kind," suggested Busby. "Let's cut 
Elmo in and ask him directly . . . 
Elmo, what's going on? What are 
those things?" 

"-Q-V-Z-S. Electronic Monitor 
reports solution to problem six, 
two-nine, eight. Contact made with 
intelligent life on Proxima Cen- 
tauri." 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



87 



The Senator dropped his note- 
book as he jumped to his feet 

"A matter-transmitter field has 
been established at Computer 
Base and surrounding neighbor- 
hood to serve as a receiving cen- 
ter for the shipment of gleep from 
the second planet of Proxima Cen- 
tauri. This liquid ore, when re- 
leased in the form of gases, will 
counteract the cobalt radiation in 
Terran atmosphere. All that re- 
mains is the payment for the twen- 
ty billion tuns of gleep as per our 
trade agreement." 

THE Senator screeched. "Trade 
agreement? Busby, what is 
this?" 

"Elmo," chided Busby, "you 
can't make a trade agreement. 
That's against the law. Only Con- 
gress can—" 

Elmo interrupted. "That would 
be the case, Private Busby, if it 
were a matter of trade here on 
Earth. The people of the planet 
Kdoolit are not from Earth— or 
even our own Solar System. The 
Senator himself would have to 
agree that the law does not apply." 

"We'll pass a law!" shouted the 
Senator. 

"That might prevent a recur- 
rence," said Elmo, "but it would 
hardly affect anything done before 
the passage of such a law. That is 
fortunate, since gleep is essential 
for the preservation of life on 
Earth. I have solved the problem. 



The rest is up to you." 

"To me?" said Busby. "Why al- 



ways me?" 

"To the governments of Earth," 
amended Elmo. 

"This time," roared the Sena- 
tor, "you've gone too far! You've 
overstepped your authority—" 

"I suggest," continued Elmo, 
"that Congress make arrangements 
with the people of Asia as to pay- 
ment. The shipment of gleep will 
be completed within forty-eight 
hours. I have been informed that 
the Kdoolans will require C.O.D. 
payment in full, since Earth has 
not yet established a galactic 
credit rating." 

Busby was almost afraid to ask 
the obvious question. "Elmo, tell 
me. Whafs the payment for this 
gleep?" 

"The best terms I could get for 
twenty billion tuns of gleep de- 
livered, via interstellar matter- 
portation, was the exchange of the 
ore for the continent of Asia. We're 
getting a bargain." 

"Busby, you heard him! You 
heard what he said! Asia — he 
traded twenty-billion tuns of greep 
for Asia!" 

"Gleep," corrected Elmo, "not 
greep. Yes, it was difficult to find 
something the Kdoolans actually 
needed. There was nothing else to 
make it worthwhile for them to 
matterport the molten ore over the 
distance of four and one-third light- 
years." 



88 




 




THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



89 



"He's sold one of Earth's conti- 
nents . . ." moaned the Senator. 

"Only after exploring every 
other possibility," said Elmo. 

Busby tried another angle. "You 
can't do that, Elmo. Ifs against 
all your restrictive tapes. All those 
millions of people—" 

"Oh, no, not the people," said 
Elmo, "just the land. Though it 
may create problems of relocation 
and reorganization, that is not in- 
soluble." 

The Senator staggered around 
in circles as if trying to tag some- 
one in a game of blind man's buff. 
"He's crazy! He's out of his mind! 
How can he sell a chunk of Earth?" 

BUSBY suspected that he had 
not yet learned the complete 
story. "Elmo, what do they want 
with Asia?" 

"The Kdoolans live on a planet 
whose land mass rests on a high- 
ly unstable molten core. It is this 
lava from which they are able to 
pump out gleep — somewhat as 
we pump out oil. But they are 
desperately in need of land. Most 
of what they have keeps sinking 
below sea level or getting upended 
as mountain ranges." 

"Well, they can't have Asia!" 
shouted the Senator. "That's final. 
Get in touch with 'em and tell 'em 
we'll give anything else we can 
spare, but not Asia—" 

"The Kdoolans," said Elmo, 
"have already begun delivery. 



Their sales representative, Kzar, 
informs me that as soon as the 
shipment is delivered in full, they 
will insist on payment. If we don't 
give them Asia, they'll just take 
it." 

"We'll fight! Asia or no Asia, 
it's a part of Earth and we're not 
letting any aliens get a foothold—" 

Elmo's voice sounded almost 
weary. "The Kdoolans have a cul- 
ture far beyond ours. We would 
have no way of stopping them 
from taking Asia. And now, if 
you'll excuse me, I have a new 
problem to work out." 

Busby avoided the Senator's 
stare. "N-new problem?" 

"The problem of relocating the 
entire population of Asia." 

Senator Ferdus' voice turned 
frantic. "You can't do that! That's 
half the population of Earth to 
spread over the other half!" 

"The alternative, Senator, is 
having an irate party of Kdoolans 
take over Earth for themselves. 
Now, if you don't mind, I'm faced 
with the serious problem of trans- 
porting hundreds of millions of 
refugees during the next few days. 
Since the Computer Base is set 
up as a teleport station, I will use 
this as a port of entry." 

The Senator was trying to direct 
Busby's attention to the screen. 
"Look! Look! Make him stop it, 
Busby! Make him stop!" 

Busby saw them. There in the 
shimmering, widening ball of 



90 




 



orange light in the meadow, 
framed against the background of 
hundreds of giant tanks, were a 
dozen strange creatures — serpen- 
tine things that had never walked 
the Earth before. 

The Senator grabbed the phone 
on Busby's desk, and when he 
finally found the right end, he 
shouted into it. "Get me the White 
House. The President. Emergen- 
cy. Invasion from outer space! Hel- 
lo! No, I'm not crazy! Tell him to 
call an emergency meeting!" 

Slamming the phone into its 
cradle, he shook his fist at Busby. 
"It's all your fault. You'd better 
do something about it — and 
damned quick! " 

Before Busby could answer, the 
Senator was out of the room. 

A T the secret meeting of the 
•**• cabinet and the leaders of 
Congress, it was agreed that some 
other payment should be made 
to the aliens for the gleep. 

"What if they refuse?" asked 
the Senator from Missouri. 

"Then," declared the Secretary 
of State, "we go to the brink of 
war!" 

Busby, forgetting that he was 
merely an invited guest, spoke 
up. "Mr. Secretary, Elmo won't 
permit war." 

The Secretary glowered at Bus- 
by and thoughtfully pulled his 
lip. "You misquote me, sir. I didn't 
say war." 



"But you said-" 
"I know exactly what I said, 
sir. I said the brink of war. Your 
Electronic Monitor has no right 
to prevent us from going to the 
brink of war as often as we like. 
It is absolutely necessary as a dip- 
lomatic technique for preserving 
the peace. And this is a time, above 
all, for diplomacy." 

It was motioned, seconded and 
passed unanimously (Busby not 
being permitted to vote) that all 
dealings with the aliens should be 
conducted through Elmo, and 
since everyone was certain that 
Elmo would not permit the Kdoo- 
lans to attack, it was established 
that absolutely no concessions 
were to be made. 

Elmo had to find another way 
to make payment, and Busby was 
responsible for seeing it done. 

Several of the Senators had 
ideas. The Senator from Wiscon- 
sin said that if the government 
would assure a subsidy, his state 
would be glad to provide cheese 
for payment of the gleep. At this 
suggestion, the Senator from Kan- 
sas leaped to his feet and said that 
wheat was the staff of life, and 
that the government should con- 
sider buying it from the farmers 
of his state to use as payment. 
The Senator from Texas just 
wanted to point out that if gleep 
had oil in it, it was subject to 
tariff, and he had to insist that 
his state be protected. 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



91 



Busby was confused until he re- 
membered it was an election year. 
This was, obviously, the beginning 
of a series of speeches for the peo- 
ple — speeches that would be re- 
called on the floor of the Senate 
for inclusion into the Congres- 
sional Record. 

Nobody noticed Busby leave 
the meeting. 

KZAR of Kdoolit, a long lizard- 
like creature with red scales, 
long tentacle-arms, and two faces, 
was waiting when Busby entered 
Elmo's control room. Elmo intro- 
duced them. Kzar bowed gracious- 
ly. His head appeared to be sup- 
ported on a swivel base, and one 
of his faces smiled while the other 
one frowned. 

"I turn the face of peace in your 
direction. We have come in peace- 
ful trade, and now we ask pay- 
ment for our services." 

"But we can't give you Asia." 
Busby frowned as he replied. 

Kzar immediately stirred in 
alarm. His glistening scales stood 
on end and he swiveled his head 
around, displaying an angry coun- 
tenance. "You dare to make war?" 

"No! No!" gasped Busby, trying 
to smile through his chattering 
teeth. "Of course not. I forgot about 
the facial expression—" 

Elmo soothed his visitor, ex- 
plaining the difference in facial 
mobility on Earth. Earthlings, he 
pointed out, could frown when 



they were really happy, pretend- 
ing they had nothing to be hap- 
py about. "This," said Elmo, "pre- 
vents the envy of a neighbor or a 
friend. A necessary protective de- 
vice. On the other hand, humans 
can smile when they are actually 
angry and even preparing for war. 
Very different from your people, 
Kzar. You must make allowances." 

Kzar looked doubtful, but he 
finally relaxed and listened to Bus- 
by. However, argue as he might, 
Busby could not convince Kzar 
that it was impractical to take 
Asia. How would the United States 
explain to the people of Asia that 
their land had been confiscated as 
payment in a business deal with 
another planet? "It won't do any 
good," said Busby, "to tell them 
we're doing it to save mankind. 
We've used that excuse too often 
before." 

"I see no alternative," thought 
Kzar, telepathing impatiently. "I 
assure you that neither Wisconsin 
cheese nor your Idaho potatoes nor 
Kansas wheat will serve us in the 
place of land. Now, if youll ex- 
cuse us, I have details to work out 
with your great problem solver, 
Elmo, about converting our gleep 
into gases to release into your at- 
mosphere." 

LATER that afternoon, at the 
White House, Busby learned 
that Senator Ferdus had reported 
to his commanding officer about 



92 




 



the chess games with Elmo. It was 
generally agreed that Busby's mis- 
use of Elmo had resulted in the 
crisis at hand. Furthermore, the 
Senator suggested to the Army 
that Busby had the power to solve 
this whole mess if he really wanted 
to, and it was obviously his lack 
of patriotism that prevented him 
from doing so. He even hinted that 
Busby might be a Kdoolit agent 
in disguise, planted here on Earth 
years ago to work out this dia- 
bolical plot. 

When they finally let Busby go, 
it was with the ultimatum to find 
a way of preventing the loss of 
Asia and at the same time getting 
rid of the Kdoolan threat to the 
peace. As the General of the Army 
put it: "Private Busby, that's an 
order! See that you do it or—" 

Outside, Busby sat down on the 
steps of the Capitol. For half an 
hour, he sat there feeding the 
pigeons while he wept. "Whatever 
I do, I'm going to get it in the 
neck. I feel like telling them to 
take this uniform and do what- 
ever they damn well please with 
it." He sat there daydreaming 
about what it would be like to 
go home to Allenville, back to his 
little repair shop, where he could 
make his daily rounds from door 
to door and do little odd jobs for 
his friends and neighbors. 

If there was one thing he knew, 
it was that he had no business be- 
ing in the Army. He was the kind 



of guy who just had to be his own 
boss, and he had discovered to 
his sorrow, after so many years, 
that being your own boss was 
something they tended not to en- 
courage in the Army. 

That, of course, was what gave 
him the idea. 

All the way back to Computer 
Base in the copter, he went over 
and over the details in his mind. 
There was no doubt about it, it 
would work. If only he was not 
too late. 

When he arrived, Kzar was still 
there, and Busby — remember- 
ing to smile broadly — communi- 
cated his proposition. Kzar listened 
quietly, thought about it, and fi- 
nally agreed to leave Asia exactly 
where it was. He praised Busby for 
a most superior solution to the 
entire problem. Busby smiled and 
let his hand rest contentedly on 
the metal shell that covered Elmo's 
master keys. From now on, things 
were going to be mighty different 
around here. 

"JC 1 ARLY next morning, Busby 
■" admitted Senator Ferdus to 
the Vault and informed him that 
the crisis was over. 

The Senator looked suspicious. 
"What crisis?" 

"Well, the Kdoolans are gone 
and Asia is still where it always 
was. That's why I called you." 

The Senator shook his head. 
"Busby, I don't believe a word of 



THE TROUBLE WITH ELMO 



93 



it. What are you trying to pull 
now?" 

Busby flipped the dials on the 
televiewer to focus on the meadow 
where the Kdoolans first landed 
on Earth. They were gone and so 
were their empty gleep tanks. 
Once again the meadow was green. 

The Senator stared. "And you 
say Asia is still where it belongs?" 

Busby nodded. 

"All right, Busby, what have you 
done? If you've betrayed our gov- 
ernment in any way — given away 
any military secrets—" 

Busby waved these comments 
aside. "The only thing I gave away 
was our problem." He flipped the 
dial to show the area where the 
Electronic Computer had once 
stood. "The Kdoolans were crazy 
about Elmo. They have tremen- 
dous problems to solve. We've 
been wanting to get rid of Elmo 
for the last fifteen years. So — the 
most logical thing in the world — 
I gave them Elmo instead of 
Asia." 

Senator Ferdus blinked vacant- 
ly. "You gave them what?" 

"All your worries are over. The 
Kdoolans transported Elmo to 
Proxima Centauri during the 
night. As far as Earth is concerned, 
he's completely dismantled, de- 
commissioned, demolished. Elmo 
is gone." 

As the words took effect, the 
Senator began to burble. 

"You — you gave Elmo away? 



A multi-billion dollars worth of 
equipment? All the computer 
secrets that we've guarded all these 
years? You gave them away? This 
is treason, Busby! Treason! You 
can be executed for this! And I 
promise you, Busby, I promise 
you—" 

Busby backed away. He had 
known this was going to happen, 
that Senator Ferdus would be on 
his back no matter what he did. 

"Wait a minute, Busby. You're 
lying." The Senator paused and 
looked at the screen again. "You 
know as well as I do that Elmo 
was built to solve problems for 
human beings. Elmo just won't 
work up there on Kdoolit And 
besides, there's no one who knows 
how to service him but you, Bus- 
by — and you're here. Come clean, 
Busby. Lef s have the truth. What 
have you done with Elmo? 
Where'd you hide him? You ought 
to know you can't swipe a multi- 
billion-dollar government computer 
and get away with it. What have 
you done with the blasted—" 

The Senator stopped. His eyes 
opened wide; his thick white eye- 
brows arched into question marks; 
his red face drained of all its color. 
He looked frantically around the 
chamber. The door hadn't opened, 
and there was no place where Bus- 
by could possibly have hidden. 

"Busby?" he whispered. "Where 
are you, Busby?" 

He looked under the desk, be- 



94 




 



hind the chairs, between the rows 
of empty shells where Elmo's elec- 
tronic computing units had, until 
yesterday, pulsed with thought. 

"It's all just a bad dream," he 
reassured himself. "He couldn't 
just vanish into thin air. He was 
never here ..." 

Yet there, in the ashtray, chewed 
to shreds as it always was when 
Busby was upset, the Senator saw 
Busby's still-lit cigar. 

"Busby!" he roared, pounding 
the desk with his fist. "Busby, 
come back!" 

IN a hastily erected Computer 
-■- Base on Kdoolit, the second 
planet in the system of Proxima 
Centauri, Mr. Jake Busby relaxed 
over the chess board with a tall, 
frosty glass of Kdoolan beer. He 
smiled as he recalled his last 



glimpse of Senator Harry Ferdus' 
face. As Ferdus had said, Elmo 
would solve problems only for 
humans. But Jake Busby was the 
one man who could service Elmo, 
and Jake Busby was a human, 
wasn't he? 

And then, thought Busby, when 
all the problems on Kdoolit were 
solved, there would be no need for 
Elmo to manufacture new ones. 
There were millions of worlds in 
the Cosmos with intelligent life 
and problems to be solved. Now 
Elmo had a reason to exist, and, 
for that matter, so did Busby. 
They were partners in the Univer- 
sal Fixit Company. 

"Anyway," he said aloud, fin- 
ishing the glass of beer, "it's a liv- 
ing — and I'm my own boss." 

"Your move," said Elmo.

NOBODY moaned: "Buddy, 
please listen to me? I'm 
hungry. Couldn't you at 
least give me something to eat?" 

We paid no attention, of course. 

"Oliver," Diane said. "I love 
you." 

I stopped and kissed her. No- 
body sobbed and drifted away in 
the mist. 

All of Grendoon was down by 
the Wallow. Torches inflamed the 
fog like living lips of fire, kissing 
each other as they blended. The 
noise of the big jungle machines 
boomed in the background, but 
it was almost drowned out by the 
crowd, a constant bull's bellow 
of noise.

Borton and the others to see it, 
there was no doubt. The police 
listened to them. Vince was 
framed - Albert admitted it" 

"I know." 

"And Dunlap? Did you know 
about him? He wasn't an Earthie; 
he was from one of the South Pole 
cities, working for Quayle, running 
in knives for trade with the sapo- 
saurs." 

"I know. When he called me 
Oliver, I knew for sure, but I'd 
wondered since that scene in the 
Club. He didn't tell me what 



Quayle had done when I threw 
the drink in his face — tried to hit 
me then, too, and didn't pass out. 
Vince Borton had to tell me about 
it. Then there was the brassard — 
Dunlap must have done it, if the 
cop didn't, and it had to be one 
or the other." 

Diane leaned forward. "It's all 
right now," she said huskily. "We 
can forget. Oliver, you're wonder- 
ful!" 

I said, reaching out to her: "I 
know."

SEVEN DEADLY VIRTUES

GALAXY'S 



5 Star Shelf 



CITIZEN OF THE GALAXY 

by Robert A. Heinlein, Charles 
Scribner's Sons, N. Y., $2.95 

AT first, it appeared that Hein- 
lein had fallen over the same 
fallacy that afflicted the van Vogt 
post-atomic series: extreme tech- 
nological skill in a primitive so- 
ciety. Starting his story in a slave 
market, Heinlein soon makes his 
point that even in so-called en- 
lightened eras in history, frontiers 
always brought slavery into being. 
In Sargon, capital of the Nine 
Worlds, sedan chairs toted by 
slaves are a mark of elegance. 

126 



Thorby, a young, fiercely rebel- 
lious boy, is auctioned to an old 
one-legged beggar who refuses to 
be his master. In actuality, he has 
rescued the boy from slavery. He 
teaches Thorby languages, con- 
centration and retention. 

Although their sole income is 
from alms, it is soon evident to 
Thorby that Baslim is far from 
being solely a beggar. This is 
proved forcefully one day when 
Baslim disappears and Thorby is 
hounded into hiding by the police. 
In accord with the old man's in- 
structions, he manages to locate 
the skipper of a spaceship of the 


 



Free Traders and to repeat a hyp- 
notically memorized message from 
the old beggar. 

As foster son of Baslim, to whom 
the Traders owe a debt of honor, 
Thorby is accepted as one of the 
People, subject to their codes and 
taboos. Here, Heinlein gives an 
accurate and detailed anthropolog- 
ical picture of a small isolated 
culture, practicing both exogamy 
and endogamy as well as being a 
patrilocal matriarchy. 

Sounds frightening, but it's a 
humanities course in one easy les- 
son. 

Thorby's actual identity is a bit 
startling, but Heinlein is invariably 
logical. And invariably entertain- 
ing, I might add, even when en- 
gaged in a crusade against future 
slavery. 

A STIR OF ECHOES by Richard 
Matheson. J. B. Lippincott Co., 
Phila., $3.00 

DOBINSON'S Power and 
-"Maine's Isotope Man preced- 
ed Matheson's in Lippincott's 
"Novel of Menace" series. Like 
Power, Stir of Echoes qualifies in 
full. Matheson expertly builds a 
mood of horror and terror that 
only on one occasion exceeds cre- 
dulity. 

After a jocose opening, which 
nevertheless fits the spirit of the 
parlor-game hypnosis stunt that 
precipitates the action, the story 



becomes taut and gripping. Tom 
Wallace is the scoffing subject of 
his college-student brother-in-law 
at one of neighbor Elsie's deadly 
dull parties. Incredibly, he goes 
under. 

The repercussions begin later, 
however, as a result of the hypno- 
tist freeing and uninhibiting his 
mind. That night, he sees a ghostly 
woman in black. He later finds 
that he possesses either clairvoy- 
ance or low telepathy. He is aware 
of imminent or impending death. 
He cannot read thoughts, but is 
susceptible to and overwhelmed by 
raw emotion. His life becomes a 
complete nightmare because his 
newfound gift is completely uncon- 
trollable and unpredictable. 

Matheson rides the nightmare 
to the finish line in a lather of cold 
sweat.

WASP by Eric Frank Russell. 
Avalon Books, N. Y., $2.75 

RUSSELL, old pro, has a real 
sleeper here. He draws on his 
wartime experience in the British 
Army and the almost incredible 
feats of British Intelligence in the 
darkest days of WW II when 
Britain could only sting its enemy. 
The Sirian Combine and Terra 
are at war and, although inferior 
technologically, Sirius has an over- 
whelming numerical advantage — 
so much so that Terra is forced 
to adopt the Wasp technique. 

James Mowry, Wasp, was born 
and spent his first seventeen years 
on Sirian Diracta. Special train- 
ing, pigmentation and surgery en- 
able him to pass as Sirian on 
planet Jaimec where he is to sting 
the planetary officials by one-man 
sabotage, rumor-mongering and as- 
sassination into crediting existence 
of a widespread underground anti- 
war organization. 

Russell has invested this hard- 
boiled yarn with plenty of action 
and authenticity. A fine light 
opera. 

ONCE AROUND THE SUN by 
Ronald Fraser. The Macmillan 
Co., N. Y., $3.95 



THE IGY program is a com- 
plicated enterprise, and Dr. 
Fraser as Administrative Secretary 
of the International Council of Sci- 
entific Unions, worldwide sponsor 
of the IGY, has the inside track 
on information about it. 

The title is a misnomer — the 
IGY was chosen for maximum sun- 
spot activity, a period of eighteen 
months. 

A glance at the contents page 
alone sets the head spinning with 
the ramifications of the program. 
Part I "On the Boundaries of the 
Known World" subheads the 
Earth's size and shape, magnetic 
fields, wandering poles, atmos- 
pheric jet streams, ocean current, 
the night airglow and chemistry of 
the atmosphere, the atmospheric 
heat engine and multiple etcs. Part 
II, "Toward New Horizons," cate- 
gorizes the areas of cooperation 
among the nations for the purpose 
of extending knowledge of Part I. 

Jampacked with data and ex- 
planation, ORTS is virtually a 
handbook of the IGY.

"Lorelei of the Red Mist" by 



128 




 



Bradbury and Brackett is the oper- 
atic result of a barely post-war 
collaboration, when neither of 
these talents had jelled into pres- 
ent solidity. It is a pleasant super- 
fantasy-adventure on Venus in a 
more-so mood of Burroughs and 
Kline. 

"The Golden Helix" by Stur- 
geon is an account of the estab- 
lishment of a star colony by three 
couples who awaken from sus- 
pended animation to find them- 
selves either the pawns or the gods 
of a mysterious race. The story 
has the moments of poetry to be 
found in any Sturgeon work but 
doesn't rank as real Sturgeon. 

"Destination Moon" by Hein- 
lein more than makes up for the 
minor shortcomings of the other 
yarns. This masterpiece of film 
and print still has immense emo- 
tional impact and credibility and is 
of redoubled interest now that the 
Age of Space has truly dawned.

CPUTNIK'S prime effect was to 
^ spotlight the inadequacies of 
American education. To supple- 
ment formal study, I will present 
monthly reviews of noteworthy 
items. 

The three books above are 
excellently done popularizations 
in narrative form, full of palatable 
information, experiments and il- 
lustrations. 

Randy Morrow, brother Sam 
and their science-writer father car- 
ry the thread of story continuity 
in each volume. In Chemistry, the 
boy's carbide lamp fails at a spe- 
lunking outing. A recommended 
local chemist is a teen-aged girl 
who teaches Randy chemical fun- 
damentals. In Electronics, Randy 
overcomes the animosity of a mal- 
adjusted young ham operator. 
Atomic Energy sees the boys visit 
Argonne National Laboratory. 

My only quibble is the empha- 
sis on these being boys' books. By 
actual test, I have found them to 
be of equal interest to teen-age 
girls. 

If Popular Mechanics intends, 
as I hope, to make this a series, 
they have set a genuinely high 
and meritorious standard for them- 
selves.

IN BLACK 

AND WHITE 

By J. T. MclNTOSH 

To poke loopholes in galactic 
law, never advertise what you 
are selling ... so you can sell 
what you are not advertising! 

Illustrated by MARTINEZ 



1 LOOKED in the tank and 
shuddered. My lovely wife 
Rogan was turning into some- 
thing I couldn't look at for long 
without getting sick. I decided not 
to risk looking in there again. 

Ped was in the control sphere 
playing with a black and white 
board and a lot of little disks. I'd 
seen him at it before. 

"What's this?" I inquired. 
"Game I picked up on Earth. 
Checkers." 



"It isn't in the spools," I ac- 
cused. 

"Is. You haven't digested them 
all," he accused back. 

"I still have two to go," I ad- 
mitted. "Is the game any good?" 

He showed me. It was very 
simple. I said so, wondering what 
he saw in it. 

"Try," he said, indicating the 
white discs. 

I made a move. He made one. 
I made another. 



130 




 



"See?" he said. 

I had to take a piece. He took 
two. I had to take another. He 
moved. I took another. He moved 
again. I took one more. 

Having got me exactly where 
he wanted me, he wiped me off 
the board. 

"I see," I said. "The rule about 
capture makes it. Think if 11 go in 
the Twenty Worlds?" 

"Can try," said Ped. He pushed 
the board away. "What are you 
trying to sell on this planet?" 

"Nothing much," I said. 

Ped spat I winced. He was an 
old man with a lot of nasty habits 
he'd picked up on the umpteen 
worlds on which he'd been the 
first Vigintan. But I had to put 
up with him, nasty habits and all, 
because I knew of nobody with 
one-tenth his talent in his own valu- 
able line. 

How many people could land 
on an alien world about which 
nobody knew anything and leave 
it six months later with complete 
knowledge of the language, cus- 
toms and physical structure of the 
principal race? And no unsolved 
crime left on the planet, either, 
or suspicion among the highest 
creatures of the world concerned 
that an alien had been among 
them. 

"You know the law," I said 
virtuously. "We can't exploit this 
or any other unaffiliated world." 

"I know it," he said skeptically. 



A N YWAY, it was none of Ped's 

■**■ business. He was retained 
simply to teach us enough for us 
to pass as natives. Rogan and I 
wouldn't have had a hope landing 
on our own, without Ped's expert 
preliminary work. 

"What do you sell, usually?" 
he asked. 

"Ergeron," I said, knowing he 
could find out, anyway. 

"What's that?" 

"It powers this ship." 

"Oh," he said. "Well, they're a 
long way from that Two centuries 
at least. They'll go to their moon 
any day, and the planets the fol- 
lowing week. But deep space . . . 
they won't be buying ergeron for 
three centuries at least." 

"Well, I guess my company will 
still be around in three centuries," 
I said. "And they'll still have to 
use ergeron. It's the only way, 
theoretically." 

He spat again. I decided to ter- 
minate this conversation pretty 
quickly. I didn't like the turn it 
was taking. 

"What are you selling now?" he 
asked. 

"I don't know." Before he spat 
again, which seemed to be his un- 
hygienic way of saying "I don't 
believe you," I went on hastily: 
"That is, I don't know what we're 
going to call it What we're going 
to say it will do, I guess." 

"You mean it won't do it?" 

"No, it'll do what we say." I

turned away. "If I digest the other 
two spools now, can you get the 
metabolism change started? " 

"Right away. Your wife should 
be pretty well along." 

I shuddered again. "She is. I 
looked." 

"Wait," he said. "One thing you'd 
better know. Ifs not on the spools. 
It's no more than a hunch about 
these people." 

"Think I'd better hear it, if ifs 
only a hunch?" 

"Obviously. You're going to do 
something good? Bad?" 

"Good, I'd say." 

"Naturally you'd say." He spat. 
But this time I was a long way 
away. "Remember this. These peo- 
ple see things in black and white. 
No grays. You're a friend, every- 
thing you do is fine. You're an 
enemy, nothing you ever do can 
be right. They like you, you're 
in. They hate you, you're outside 
for good." 

"Thanks," I said. "That may be 
useful. We should convince them 
at all costs that what we're doing 
is good?" 

"You'd better," said Ped. 

"IVTEXT time I saw Rogan, things 
-L^ were different. I was one of 
the things that were different, and 
that made a big difference in the 
way she looked to me. Now it 
was Ped who made us both sick. 
We didn't have to look at him, 
but we had to smell him. It was a 



pity that the two species, Terran 
human and Vigintan, could use 
the same atmosphere and tempera- 
ture range. Being Terran and be- 
ing in the same room with a Vigin- 
tan was an experience we could 
have done without. 

Like and dislike are a lot more 
physical than you know until 
you've made a body-change. I'd 
seen Rogan as a Terran and I'd 
been sick — but that was when I 
was Vigintan. Now that we were 
both Terran, she was wonderful, 
far more beautiful than when we 
were both Vigintan. That meant 
sex was a stronger impulse on 
Earth than on the Twenty Worlds. 

Rogan was thinking the same 
thing. She murmured: "This is go- 
ing to be interesting. On some 
worlds, sex is nice; on other worlds, 
ifs nasty; but on any world there's 
nothing quite like it." 

"Where there is sex, that is," 
I remarked. 

'Where there isn't, I don't go. 
I have better things to do than be 
a neuter." 

"When do you want me to come 
back for you?" Ped interrupted. 
We spoke English, he Vigintan— 
it was easier that way. 

I reflected. "How much local 
currency did you say you'd col- 
lected for us?" 

"Ten thousand dollars." 

I checked that against what I'd 
learned from the spools. "Which 
isn't exactly a fortune." 



132 




 



"Best I could do." 

'Well have to start in a small 
way. I guess we'll need six weeks." 
I wanted so much to get away from 
the Vigintan smell that I could 
hardly think straight. We should 
have fixed all this before making 
the body-changes — or made Ped 
resume his Terran shape. 

"Think six weeks will be 
enough?" Ped asked. 

"Yes. Let's go, Rogan." 

"Haven't you forgotten some- 
thing?" Ped asked mildly. 

"I don't think so." 

"They wear clothes on this 
planet." 

groaned. "We'll put them on 
■*■ in the landing car," I said. 

"It couldn't be that you don't like 
rny company?" Ped inquired. 

"I hate to say this," I said, "but 
you stink." 

"So do you," said Ped, unruffled. 
"Both of you. Also, you look—" 

"I know," I said hastily. "Vigin- 
tans and humans are different. 
Let's leave it at that" 

I shut the door behind us. Al- 
most at once, the landing car's air 
refiner swirled away the last traces 
of Vigintan scent — though to call 
it that is to flatter it — and we 
breathed delicious clean air. 

"We don't know how to wear 
these things," Rogan objected, stir- 
ring the little pile of clothes with 
her foot. "We should have let him 
show us." 



"I know," I said, "but I couldn't 
stand it any longer." 

"I know what you mean," she 
said feelingly. 

The little car was falling away 
from the parent ship. It was time 
to make ourselves into civilized 
Terrans. 

We knew a lot about Earth 
from the spools we'd digested, but 
that was all theoretical, and put- 
ting clothes on is practical. Though 
Rogan knew what the little wisps 
of white nylon were meant to be, 
it needed quite a lot of experimen- 
tation to get them on right. Imagine 
putting on a brassiere for the first 
time, when you haven't seen any- 
body putting one on, or wearing 
one. We kept putting things on 
back to front, and telling each 
other doubtfully: "I'm sure that 
can't be right." 

However, when Rogan looked 
at last as if her dress had been 
painted on her, we were sure that 
might be right. Funny how back- 
ward peoples can think of things 
that escape far more advanced 
races — zip-fasteners are wonder- 
ful, and when we sell the idea in 
the Twenty Worlds, it'll pay for 
the trip twice over. That's if Ped 
hasn't sold it first. 

My clothes gave me less trouble, 
once I had figured one thing out. 
Rogan's fastenings were all at the 
back, which gave us the idea all 
mine must be too, only they 
weren't. My clothes were pretty 



IN BLACK AND WHITE 



133 



crumpled by the time I'd estab- 
lished that. 

By then, we had landed in the 
spot Ped had picked — soft soil 
four hundred yards from a high- 
way two miles outside a small 
town called Gelland. We got out 
and set the landing car to dig 
itself in. Half an hour later, there 
was only a big patch of darker 
soil to show where it was, and that 
wouldn't last long under a hot sun. 

We took careful bearings, picked 
our way to the road and started to 
walk to Gelland. 

f f "IESUS, it's hot," said Rogan. 

•I "You're not supposed to say 
that," I reminded her. 

"Am I just supposed to fry in 
silence?" 

"Not that. Women don't say 
Jesus'." 

"But it's part of the local re- 
ligion. Aren't women supposed to 
be religious?" 

"You didn't digest spool eight," 
I said accusingly. 

"I did too. I know women aren't 
supposed to say 'Jesus,' and — and 
— but the spool didn't say why not. 
I don't think it's fair that men 
should be able to use some words 
and women shouldn't. Most of 
them are very useful words. Any- 
way, I'm going to take this dress 
off." 

"You can't. Didn't you digest 
spool three?" 

Rogan sulked. 



Those references to digesting 
data may be misleading because 
it is also a Terran idiom. That, 
however, is only a metaphor; we 
really digest information — we eat 
it. Some long-ago genius — I don't 
know if he was Vigintan or there 
was a Vigintan middleman in- 
volved — couldn't see why it had 
to be a metaphor and experi- 
mented till he came up with an 
edible neuron tape onto which in- 
formation could be — well, fed — 
and the tape — how else can I ex- 
press it? — fed directly into the 
brain. Easy, cheap, permanent. 

We saw a tall, yellow-haired 
youth ambling along the highway 
in our direction and braced our- 
selves for our first effort to con- 
vince a human that we were 
human. 

"Excuse me, sir," I said. 

He stopped, but looked sur- 
prised. "Why? You ain't done 
nothin'," he said. 

Hastily I checked back, and 
there it was. On accosting a 
stranger, say, "Excuse me, sir or 
madam, as the case may be." 
Damn Ped. He'd got it wrong. 

"How do you know?" demanded 
Rogan, unable to leave well enough 
alone. 

Curiously enough, this seemed 
to be the right thing to say. The 
yellow-haired youth grinned, and 
it seemed we were all right 

"Does this road go anywhere?" 
I asked. 



134 




 



Now I knew as I said it that 
that wasn't quite right. I should 
have said something like "How 
far to the next town?" But there 
was no need for this character to 
say: 

"Naw. I been watching it all 
day and it ain't moved yet." 

Y1TE had been unlucky enough 
* * to meet a humorist. We pos- 
sess a sense of humor too, but 
there was no telling if it was the 
same. As a matter of fact, it is, 
more or less, but we didn't know 
that then. 

"How far to the next town?" I 
asked warily. 

"Three miles," he said. "Maybe 
four." 

Rogan turned to me resentfully. 
"Ped said it was only—" 

I dug her in the ribs. "Thanks," 
I said to the youth. 

"Think nothin' of it." 

"I won't," I assured him cour- 
teously. 

He stared at us and moved 
slowly on. 

"I wonder what we did wrong," 
I mused when I was sure he 
couldn't hear me. 

"I know what we did wrong," 
Rogan complained. "Trusting that 
Ped! Three miles — that's about 
six thousand five hundred of these 
steps . . . Jesus!" 

"I told you not to say that." 

She said a coarser word. "If if s 
actually that far, I am not going to 

IN BLACK AND WHITE 



carry this ridiculous extra weight," 
she declared. 

She took off her dress. 

Almost immediately a car, the 
first we'd seen — naturally Ped had 
picked a very quiet roadway — 
came up behind us, went past us 
swerving all over the road with 
three faces goggling at us and 
came to a halt about two hundred 
yards further on. Before we 
reached it, however, a woman got 
out of the back seat, pushed over 
the man in the driving seat and 
drove off. 

"Well, what do you know about 
that?" said Rogan. 

"If you don't put your dress 
back on," I said grimly, "I will." 

"Idiot," she retorted. "You'd 
never get into it." 

"Refer to spool seven," I said. 
"When to wear which clothes." 

"I was half asleep when I di- 
gested that," she admitted. "Oh, 
well, I guess you're right. Zip me 
up the back." 

'X^HERE were a lot more mis- 
■■• takes we made, but a couple 
of days later we were past the 
worst. We knew that if people 
looked old-fashioned at us, we 
just had to pretend it was all a 
joke, and we knew that almost 
anything Rogan said was regarded 
as a joke anyway. We knew that 
the yellow-haired youth had stared 
because people don't walk along 
a highway dressed as we were and 

135 



not carrying anything. We knew 
that if we'd said our car was out 
of gas, he'd have been satisfied — 
only that might have landed us in 
trouble too, when we failed to 
produce a car, so perhaps it was 
just as well that we hadn't made 
any explanations. 

We took a hotel room — not the 
first we tried; the second. It was a 
pity about that first hotel. Ped 
had told us about wedding rings, 
and made one when he made the 
clothes, but Rogan had forgotten 
to put it on. It was probably still 
on the floor of the landing car. 

AT the second hotel, there was 
no trouble. 

The first thing was to make some 
of the stuff I'd developed on the 
ship and find a name for it. We 
wanted to call it Elixir of Life, but 
found that had been used. Every 
name we thought of had already 
been used. 

Then Rogan read a wonderful 
book called Alice in Wonderland 
and we decided to call it simply 
Drink Me. 

There were difficulties in mak- 
ing Drink Me, and not the ones 
I'd expected. It wasn't in the least 
difficult to get chemicals and drugs; 
the trouble was that they weren't 
quite what I expected when I got 
them. Standards were different, 
but I'd anticipated that. What 
I had not considered were the 
impurities. 



Seems obvious, but I hadn't 
realized that what a chemist calls 
impurities are quite arbitrary, and 
different in every culture. Iodine is 
an impurity in salt if you don't 
want it. So are air, water, oxygen, 
hydrogen, carbon, in anything. I 
kept finding that human chemists 
had gone to enormous trouble to 
remove from this or that something 
that I wanted left in, and hadn't 
bothered about something else that 
I wanted left out. 

Water was worst of all. On my 
home planet, we seldom bother to 
distill water; consequently, our 
standard is undistilled water. 
Shocking chemistry on Earth, I 
know. Trouble was, neither fresh 
water nor distilled water reacted 
quite the way I wanted, and I had 
to go to a lot of trouble to intro- 
duce the proper impurities. 

"Call yourself a chemist," said 
Roger derisively, while I sweated 
blood. 

Despite the difficulties, I had a 
couple of dozen bottles of Drink 
Me ready in a day or two. Then 
we saw a lawyer and fixed up the 
legal side. That was easy, because 
we didn't care much about exclu- 
sive rights. 

That puzzled him a lot. 

I couldn't very well explain that 
after a week or two we weren't go- 
ing to be around to collect the cash, 
so we didn't care who got it. 

I had a few thousand labels 
printed. They said: 



136 




 




IN BLACK AND WHITE

DRINK ME 

for Coughs 
Colds 
Catarrh 
Bronchitis 
Asthma 
Headaches 
etc. 

In small type, the formula was 
given, but there was a warning that 
the manner of preparation was im- 
portant. If an ordinary Earth 
chemist made it up according to 
the given formula, the result would 
be harmless but wouldn't work. 

On the Twenty Worlds, we're 
not geniuses and we don't know 
everything. In biology, however, 
we have practically all the an- 
swers. Making ourselves Terran 
bodies was just one of our party 
tricks. The elixir was another. With 
the information Ped had brought 
back, it had been child's play for 
me to throw Drink Me together. 

Getting it on the market wasn't 
nearly so easy. After buying clothes 
and things, and living expenses, we 
only had seven thousand dollars 
left. 

"A real Elixir of Life and we 
can't sell it," Rogan sneered. 

"We haven't tried yet. You're 
the saleswoman." 

She perked up at that. She'd had 
nothing to do so far. "What do I 
do?" she asked. "How do you sell 
things here?" 

Unfortunately, we didn't quite 



know. We could have hired some- 
body to sell the stuff for us, if only 
we'd known whom to hire. But 
things are awkward when you're in 
a strange land, no matter how 
much theoretical knowledge you 
have about it. 

What we eventually did was 
this. Rogan made the rounds of 
the various drugstores in town, 
buying aspirin or bromides or 
paperback books, until she found 
an owner who had a heavy asth- 
matic wheeze. It had to be an 
owner, of course. Then she told 
him brightly there was no need to 
wheeze like that. She was travel- 
ing for a firm which had made 
asthma prehistoric. 

"Just try this," she said, pro- 
ducing the bottle. "I'll be back in 
a couple of hours." 

"Hey, wait a minute," wheezed 
E. Levitski, Prop. But Rogan was 
gone. 

When she went back, his asthma 
had completely gone. 

"It was too easy," she told me 
later. "He fell over himself to buy 
a couple of gross. What's a gross?" 

I explained as I made up the 
couple of gross. We delivered them. 

"Now what do we do?" Rogan 
asked. 

"We take a holiday," I said. 
"This job is finished, honey." 

WE spent a couple of weeks 
having fun in our part of 
Earth. There were forests, lakes 



138 




 



and rivers, and we liked it all. We 
weren't much interested in the peo- 
ple everywhere. Every town in the 
Galaxy is full of people. 

But we liked the fishing and we 
liked bathing. 

Bathing — now there's some- 
thing. 

Nobody on the Twenty Worlds 
has ever willingly immersed him- 
self or herself in water. Maybe 
that's one reason we smell. Another 
reason we don't do it is we'd never 
come out. It's all very well for Ter- 
rans — they float. 

How we came to learn to swim 
was, Rogan was moaning as usual 
about the heat when we happened 
to see a couple of girls in bathing 
suits. Nobody had told us about 
that. Ped had been too busy other- 
wise to find out about bathing suits 
— and, as I said, he was an old 
man, anyway. 

Naturally, Rogan had to get into 
a suit. Then she found what they 
were for. 

We were horrified. Rationally, 
we knew it was quite likely that 
human bodies would float. Emo- 
tionally, we knew too well that if 
we went into the water, we'd sink 
like stones. 

BUT Rogan was still hot and the 
water of the lake looked beau- 
tifully cool. She waded in, waving 
good-by. 

Five minutes later, she could 
float. It was amazingly easy. And 



after that we spent a lot of our 
time in the water. 

At the end of a couple of weeks, 
we went back to Levitski's to see 
what had happened. 

Nothing had happened. 

I couldn't believe it. He had sold 
a couple of dozen bottles of Drink 
Me, but that was all. And he'd 
only been able to do that because 
he'd been telling everybody with 
obvious sincerity how wonderful 
the stuff was. 

Could it be that everybody who 
had bought the stuff had been 100 
per cent healthy and sane? 

Two days later, however, we 
had the first nibble. Levitski rang 
up to ask for more. Somebody had 
come in and bought his entire 
stock. 

I made more. And more. And 
more. Soon I couldn't make it fast 
enough. 

It was a shock to learn, however, 
that people were simply buying 
it as an asthma cure. 

We set up a small factory to 
make the stuff — it was simple 
enough, so long as I supervised 
operations. And then orders started 
coming in from all over the place 
— one from as far as Philadelphia, 
nearly a thousand miles away. 

Then one day, when I arrived 
back at our hotel, Rogan was 
looking excited and secretive. 

"There's a man to see you," she 
said. "Dr. Byron. Do you think he 
suspects what we are?" 



IN BLACK AND WHITE 



139 






I went in to see him and find 
out. 

P|R. James Byron was a young- 
*-^ ish man, very energetic and 
excitable. "Mr. Smith?" he said. 

I admitted it, then also cau- 
tiously admitted that I had de- 
veloped Drink Me. 

Dr. Byron produced two large 
plates which I recognized as chest 
X-rays. "You're not a doctor?" 

I shook my head. "Just a 
chemist." 

"Nevertheless, you might find 
these interesting." The first X-ray 
showed three tubercular cavities. 
In the second, the cavities were 
much less distinct. 

"You see?" said Byron excited- 
ly. "Regeneration. Do you know 
anything about this, Mr. Smith?" 

"Only what youVe told me," I 
said. "This is unusual, isn't it?" 

"There was precisely one week 
between these X-rays," said Byron. 
"And the only thing I can find to 
account for this astonishing change 
is that my patient took some of 
your product. Against my advice, I 
may say. I repeat, Mr. Smith — 
do you know anything about this?" 

"We never claimed that Drink 
Me was a cure for tuberculosis," 
I stated. 

He stared at me. "Why not? In 
my experience, drugs of this sort 
are supposed to do anything. I 
sometimes wonder why anybody 
ever dies." 



Sarcasm. Obviously this was a 
case for Rogan. I brought her in. 

"This is the sales representa- 
tive," I said. "My wife Rogan." 

Byron fixed her with his rather 
wild gaze. "Mrs. Smith, what is 
this product for?" 

"Coughs and colds," said Rogan 
brightly. "It positively won't make 
hair grow." 

"Will it cure tuberculosis?" 

"Well," said Rogan judicially, 
"it won't do it any harm." 

"Bronchitis, asthma, silicosis, 
pneumonia?" 

"I can only suggest," Rogan said, 
"that you try it and see." 

"I will," said Byron. 

A ND he did. He was back three 
^ days later, dazed. "This stuff 
seems to cure any respiratory ail- 
ment. 

"Oh, that's good," Rogan said. 
"I was sure it would be good for 
something. My husband's very 
clever." 

"I'm beginning to wonder if you 
are, too," said Byron thoughtfully. 
Curiously enough, now that he had 
found something to excite him, he 
seemed much less excited and 
much more thoughtful. "In fact, 
Mr. and Mrs. Smith, I'm beginning 
to get ideas about you two." 

We couldn't help exchanging 
startled glances. 

"I'm just wondering," said By- 
ron, "when you're going to stop 
charging a dollar a bottle and start 



140 




 



charging, say, fifty dollars." 

"Oh," said Rogan, relieved that 
that was all he was wondering. 
"You think we should?" 

Byron stared hard at her. "What 
else won't this thing do besides 
not making hair grow?" 

"Well," said Rogan, "we never 
said it would cure cancer." 

Byron jumped in the air and 
scuttled out. 

"Six weeks was a good guess," 
I said complacently. 

Once you start a huge ball roll- 
ing? you can't stop it if you try. As 
it happened, we didn't want to stop 
it. 

We were gradually becoming 
famous. So was Drink Me. Our pic- 
tures appeared in the papers. We 
were on newsreels. We sold a 
bottle of Drink Me in Washington. 
The President had had a cough. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
brand of stockings. Somebody had 
noticed her legs. 

A famous male film star rang 
us up and asked plaintively if it 
was quite true that Drink Me 
wouldn't make hair grow. We said 
sorry, yes. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
shampoo. Somebody had noticed 
her hair. 

A Kentucky farmer claimed to 
have got drunk on Drink Me. He 
didn't sue; he was delighted. We 
couldn't account for the incident. 
It turned out that his wife had 
put the medicinal brandy in an 



empty Drink Me bottle. 

Rogan was asked to sponsor a 
new girdle. People were noticing 
too damned much about Rogan. 

Indeed, it was high time we dis- 
appeared. 

The next time Dr. Byron called 
to see us, he had a fat German 
doctor with him, a Dr. Hans Aus- 
terlitz. 

"It is not possible," Austerlitz 
declared, "to cure cancer in a week 
with a drug orally administered." 

We agreed. 

"Besides," said Rogan, "it's 
against the law to claim to be able 
to cure cancer at all. You know 
that, Doctor." 

"Nevertheless—" began the Heir 
Doktor. 

Rogan stopped him. "Dr. Aus- 
terlitz, we make a cough mixture. 
Please don't embarrass us." 

"But—" Austerlitz tried to con- 
tinue. 

"Please," said Rogan. 

CHE was right; it was embarrass- 
^ ing. 

I'd never forgotten what Ped 
had said about these people. We 
were public benefactors. So long 
as we were careful to stay public 
benefactors, everything we did 
was fine. Everybody loved us, ex- 
cept people who couldn't get Drink 
*Me. 

There had inevitably been a 
rush of imitators. One of them was 
called Drink This, another Try 



IN BLACK AND WH ITE 



141 



Me. They looked and tasted exact- 
ly like our product. 

But they didn't do anything, of 
course. 

People bought them only when 
supplies of Drink Me failed, which 
was often. We only had one small 
factory trying to supply the whole 
of the United States, and after that 
the rest of the world. We'd been 
careful to ensure that samples 
reached every part of Earth. 

The last time Byron called on 
us, he had a positively glassy look 
in his eye. 

"Another thing you didn't claim," 
he said weakly, "was that Drink 
Me would cure insanity." 

"Thaf s right," Rogan assented. 
"We didn't claim it, I mean." 

"Well, I've tried it," said Byron. 
"And in all cases there is a distinct 
improvement. Ordinary people 
who take it seem to have their 
minor neuroses cleared up for 
them." 

He stopped and looked at us 
pleadingly. "What is this stuff?" 

"A cough mixture," said Rogan 
brightly. 

"I'm beginning to get ideas 
again," he said. "I tried to dupli- 
cate your product. I couldn't." 

"You didn't do it right," I said. 

"I wonder. Once people have 
had a thing like this, theyVe got 
to go on having it. You could hold 
the world for ransom, you know 
that?" 

"He wouldn't do a thing like 



that," said Rogan, very shocked. 

"I wonder. Can anybody make 
it but you?" 

We saw no reason to tell him. 

Just two days before we were 
due to leave, a very awkward situ- 
ation arose. The President wanted 
to see us. His cough was better. 
Besides, new legislation was to be 
passed to buy up the Drink Me 
formula, plant, equipment and 
process for the benefit of all hu- 
manity. Apparently any time any- 
thing important happens, human 
beings have to pass laws about it. 

We managed to fix an appoint- 
ment for the day after we'd be 
gone. 

Our last morning we spent 
swimming. As we lay in the sun 
afterward, Regan sighed: "I'm go- 
ing to miss this, Jac." 

"Me too," I said. I looked at her, 
slim, tanned, provocative in a white 
sharkskin two-piece. "There's a lot 
of things I'm going to miss." 

"I'm almost sorry about what 
we're doing to them," she said. 

"Only almost?" 

"Yes, only almost. It's a good 
idea for a sales team to be two 
people in love with each other. If 
I'd been single, I'd have fallen in 
love with some human male and 
would probably have stayed here. 
And if you'd been single—" 

"I never saw a girl half as pretty 
as you." 

"You didn't look," she said com- 
placently, flexing sundry muscles 



142 




 



and making my hair stand on end. 

Soon we had to go. We had 
left everything; the people at the 
factory, the reporters, Byron and 
the others could have no clue that 
we'd been planning to disappear. 
All we had with us as we walked 
out that same road were the shoes, 
shirt and pants I wore, and the 
shoes, shorts and blouse Rogan 
wore. 

We were picked up without a 
bit of trouble by Ped. 

VES, we did miss Earth. I didn't 
-*■ know how much until we were 
back in our own bodies and I 
found that even my Vigintan mind 
remembered Rogan wistfully as a 
human female. 

I saw to my disgust that, while 
we'd been gone, Ped had been per- 
fecting a form of zip-fastener which 
he obviously intended to sell on 
the Twenty Worlds. There was 
nothing we could do about it; 
he was first. 

I took my revenge by beating 
him at checkers. On Earth, I'd 
played quite a few games. 

"Well," he said, "have you mur- 
dered them?" 

"What do you mean?" I asked. 

"Wrecked the place, so that we 
can move in? Given them some- 
thing they can use to kill them- 
selves with? Or what?" 

"You know the law," I said. 

Ped spat. 

"He's ill," said Rogan solicitous- 



ly. "Let's put him to tank, Jac." 

"I'm not ill," Ped retorted, sur- 
prised. 

"You must be. You're spitting. 
You take his leg, Jac, and I'll 
take his heads." 

I should have thought of that. 
I only saw Ped spit once more 
after that. 

"What did you do to them?" 
he demanded. "You couldn't sell 
them ergeron, so what did you 
do?" 

We saw we'd have to tell him. 

"We made an investment," I 
said. 

"We cured them," said Rogan. 

"You did what?" 

"Cured them. Left them a drug 
which mops up practically all their 
diseases. Lung infections, malig- 
nant growths, most heart diseases, 
paralysis, brain disorders." 

"And just what do you hope to 
gain by that?" 

I sighed. "Well, with the drop in 
neurosis, they don't fight wars. 
Won't be able to now. The stuff 
also makes both sexes universally 
fertile. All the killing diseases and 
war are out, so they'll breed like 
flies." 

"So?" 

I sneered. "I thought you could 
play checkers. A few years and 
their world's full. Before that, 
they've gone to the Moon. They 
find how to make homes on Mars 
and Venus, because they have to. 
Then on Mercury, the asteroids

...AND WAKING UP 30 YEARS YOUNGER 



WAN YOUR SmETHEAR 

JUST put yourself in Daniel Davis* 
place. It's the year 1970. You're a 
young engineer, about to sell a million- 
dollar invention. You're sitting pretty— 
until your passionate friend, Belle Dar- 
kin, upsets your apple cart. First she 
steals your invention. Then she slips you 
a hypo; puts you in a new kind of deep 
freeze called "The Long Sleep." 

You wake up 30 YEARS LATER, in 
the year 2000-and you're still only 29 
years old! But time has passed 
while you were in "cold storage," 
and Belle, your ex-sweetheart, is 
now 30 years older than you are ! 
Well, you've lost interest in her 
anyway, after the way she two- 
timed and future-timed you. 

The Fascinating World of 2000 A.D. 

But there are other attractions 
in that world of 2000 : its women 
in "sticktite" clothes they just 
throw away after wearing. . . its 
honeymoon trips to the moon . . . 
its remarkable new conveniences 
...its brand new words of love 
and ways to live. No more menial 
labor. Robots take care of all that. 
Soon you're enjoying life as never 
before ! You're glad to be out of 
that miserably backward world 
of the 20th century. 

But unfortunately you must get 
back to the year 1970, to take 
care of one last urgent mission. 
You only hope that you can come 
back to the 21st century by tak- 
ing "The Long Sleep" again. The 
big question is: Can it be done?
