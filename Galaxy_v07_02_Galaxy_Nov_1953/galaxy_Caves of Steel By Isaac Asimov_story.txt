Caves of Steel By Isaac Asimov 

AFTER making his accusation, 
Baley was most conscious of 
the thud of his own pulse. He 
seemed to be living in a moment 
of suspended time. R. Daneel's 
expression was, as always, unreadable. The Spacer, Dr. Han 
Fastolfe, wore a look of wellbred astonishment on his face. 

It was Commissioner Julius 
Enderby's reaction that most 
concerned Baley. The trimensic 
receiver out of which his face 
stared did not allow perfect reproduction. There was always 
that tiny flicker and that notquite-ideal resolution. Through 
that imperfection and the further 
masking of the Commissioner's 
spectacles, Enderby's eyes were 
completely unreadable. 

Baley thought : Don't go to 
pieces on me, Julius. I need you. 

He didn't really think that 
Fastolfe would act in haste or 
under emotional impulse. He had 
read somewhere once that Spacers had no religion, but substituted, instead, a cold and 
phlegmatic intellectualism raised 
to the heights of a philosophy. 
He believed that and counted on 
it. They would make a point of 
acting slowly and then only on 
the basis of reason. 

If he were alone among them 
and had said what he had said, 
he was certain that he would 



never have returned to the City. 
The Spacers' plans were worth 
more to them, many times over, 
than the life of a City-dweller. 
Maybe they would present his 
corpse to the Commissioner; 
shake their heads and speak of 
an Earthman conspiracy having 
struck again. The Commissioner 
would believe them. If he hated 
Spacers, it was a hatred based 
on fear. He wouldn't dare disbelieve them. 

That was why he had to be an 
actual witness of events — a witness, moreover, safely out of 
reach of the Spacers' calculated 
safety measures. 

'T'HE Commissioner said chokingly, "Lije, you're all wrong. 
I saw Dr. Sarton's corpse." 

"You saw the charred remnants 
of something you were told was 
Dr. Sarton's corpse," retorted 
Baley. He thought grimly of the 
Commissioner's smashed glasses. 
That had been an unexpected 
break for the Spacers. 

"No, no, Lije. I knew Dr. Sarton well and his face was undamaged." The Commissioner put his 
hand to his glasses uneasily, as 
though he, too, remembered, and 
added, "I looked at him closely, 
very closely." 

"How about this one, Commissioner?" asked Baley, pointing to 
R. Daneel again. "Doesn't he 
resemble Dr. Sarton?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



101 



"Yes, the way a statue would." 

"An expressionless attitude can 
be assumed, Commissioner. Suppose it was a robot you had seen 
blasted to death. You say you 
looked closely. Did you look 
clo&ely enough to see whether the 
charred surface at the edge of 
the blast was really organic tissue or carbonization over fused 
metal?" 

The Commissioner looked revolted. He said, "You're being ridiculous." 

Baley turned to the Spacer. 
"Are you willing to have the body 
exhumed for examination?" 

Dr. Fastolfe smiled. "I would 
have no objection, Mr. Baley, but 
we do not bury our dead. Cremation is a universal custom 
among us/' 

"Very convenient." 

"Tell me, Mr. Baley," said Dr. 
Fastolfe, "just how did you arrive at this very extraordinary 
conclusion of yours?" 

Baley thought: He isn't giving 
up. He'll brazen it out, if he can. 

He said, "There's more to imitating a robot than just putting 
on a frozen expression and adopting a stilted style of conversation. 
The trouble with you men of the 
Outer Worlds is that you're too 
used to robots. You've gotten to 
accept them almost as human beings. On Earth, we're very conscious of what a robot is. R. 
Daneel is too good a human to 



be a robot. My first impression 
of him was that he was a Spacer. 
It was quite an effort for me to 
adjust myself to his statement 
that he was a robot. And, of 
course, the reason for that was 
that he was a Spacer and wasn't 
a robot." 

R. Daneel interrupted without 
any sign of self- consciousness. 
"As I told you, partner Elijah, I 
was designed to take a temporary 
place in a human society. The resemblance to humanity is purposeful." 

"Even," asked Baley, "down 
to the painstaking duplication of 
organs which, in a robot, would 
have no conceivable function?" 

Enderby demanded suddenly, 
"How did you find that out?" 

Baley reddened. "I couldn't 
help noticing in the — in the Personal." 

Enderby looked shocked. 

FASTOLFE said, "Surely you 
understand that a resemblance 
must be complete if it is to be 
useful. For our purposes, halfmeasures are as bad as none at 
all." 

Baley asked abruptly, "May I 
smoke?" 

Three pipefuls in one day was 
a ridiculous extravagance, but he 
was riding a rolling torrent of 
recklessness and needed the release of tobacco. After all, he was 
talking back to Spacers. He was 



102 




 



going to force their lies down 
their own throat. 

Fastolfe said, "I'm sorry, but 
I'd prefer that you didn't." 

It was a "preference" that had 
the force of a command. Baley 
felt that. Of course, he thought 
angrily, Enderby didn't warn me 
because he doesn't smoke himself, 
but it follows- They don't smoke 
on their hygienic Outer Worlds, 
or drink, or have any human 
vices. No wonder they accept robots in their damned — what did 
R. Daneel call it? — C/Fe society. 
No wonder R. Daneel can play 
the robot as well as he does. 
They're all robots to begin with. 

He said, "The too-complete 
resemblance is just one point out 
of many. There was a near-riot 
in my section as I was taking 
him home." He had to point. He 
could bring himself neither to 
say "R. Daneel" nor "Dr. Sarton" aloud. "He was the one who 
stopped the trouble and he did it 
by pointing & blaster at the potential rioters." 

"Good Lord!" said Enderby. 
"The report stated that it was 
you — " 

"I know, Commissioner. The 
report was based on information 
that I gave. I didn't want to have 
it on the record that a robot had 
threatened to blast men and women." 

"No, no, of course not." Enderby was visibly horrified. He lean
THE CAVES OF STEEL 



ed forward to look at something 
out of range of the trimensic receiver. Baley could guess what 
it was. The Commissioner was 
checking the power gauge to see 
if the transmitter was being tapped. 

"Is that a point in your argument?" asked Fastolfe. 

"It certainly is. The First Law 
of Robotics states that a robot 
cannot harm a human being." 

"But R. Daneel did no harm." 

"True. He even stated afterward that he wouldn't have fired 
under any circumstances. Still, 
no robot I ever heard of could 
have violated the spirit of the 
First Law by threatening to blast 
a human crowd, even if he had 
no intention to do so." 

"I see. Are you a robotics expert, Mr. Baley?" 

"No, sir. But I've had a course 
in general robotics and in positronic analysis." 

"Very nice," said Fastolfe 
agreeably, "but, you see, I am a 
robotics expert, and I assure you 
that the essence of the robot mind 
lies in a completely literal interpretation of the Universe. It recognizes no spirit in the First Law, 
only the letter. The simple models you have on Earth may be 
incapable of threatening a human. An advanced model such as 
R. Daneel is another* matter. If 
I gather the situation correctly, 
Daneel's threat was necessary to 

10J 

\ 



prevent a riot. It was intended 
then to prevent harm to human 
beings. He was obeying the First 
Law, not defying it." 

TJALEY squirmed inwardly, 
but maintained a tight external calm. Hard as it would be, 
he would match this Spacer at 
his own game. 

He said, "You may counter 
each point separately, but they 
add up just the same. Last evening, in our discussion of the socalled murder, this alleged robot 
claimed that he had been converted into a detective by the installation of a new drive into his 
positronic circuits. A drive for 
justice." 

"I'll vouch for that," said Fastolfe. "It was done to him three 
days ago under my own supervision." 

"A drive for justice? Justice, 
Dr. Fastolfe, is an abstraction. 
Only a human being can use the 
term." 

"If you define 'justice' in such 
a way that it is an abstraction, if 
you say that it is the rendering of 
each man his due, that it is adhering to the right, or anything 
of the sort, I grant you your argument, Mr. Baley. A human 
understanding of abstractions 
cannot as yet be built into a positronic brain." 

"You admit that, then — as an 
expert in robotics?" 



"Certainly. The question is, 
what did R. Daneel mean by using the term 'justice?' " 

"From the context of our conversation, he meant what you and 
I and any human being would 
mean, but what no robot could 
mean." 

"Why don't you ask him to define the term?" 

Baley turned to R. Daneel. 
"What is your definition of justice?" 

"Justice is that which exists 
when all laws are enforced." 

Fastolfe nodded. "A good definition for a robot, Mr. Baley. 
Justice is a very concrete term to 
him since it is based on law enforcement, which is in turn based 
upon the existence of specific and 
definite laws. There is nothing 
abstract about it. A human being 
can recognize the fact that, on 
the basis of an abstract moral 
code, some laws may be bad ones 
and their enforcement unjust. 
What do you say, R. Daneel?" 

"An unjust law," said R, Daneel, "is a contradiction in terms." 

"To a robot it is, Mr. Baley. 
As you can see, you mustn't 
confuse your justice and R. 
Daneel's." 

Baley faced R. Daneel sharply 
and said, "You left my apartment last night." 

R. Daneel replied, "I did. If 
my leaving disturbed your sleep, 
I am sorry." 



104 




 



"Where did you go?" 

"To the Men's Personal." 

For a moment, Baley was staggered. It was the answer he had 
already decided was the truth, 
but he had not expected it to be 
the answer R. Daneel would give. 
He felt a little of his certainty 
oozing away. The Commissioner 
was watching, his lensed eyes 
nickering from one to the other 
as they spoke. Baley couldn't 
back down now, no matter what 
sophistries they used against him. 

He said, "On reaching my section, he insisted on entering the 
Personal with me. His excuse was 
a poor one. During the night, he 
left to visit Personal again, as he 
has just admitted. If he were a 
man, I'd say he had every reason 
and right to do so. Obviously. 
As a robot, however, the trip was 
purposeless. The conclusion can 
only be that he is a man." 

FASTOLFE nodded, seeming 
not in the least put out. "This 
is most interesting. Suppose we 
ask Daneel why he made his trip 
to the Personal last night." 

Commissioner Enderby leaned 
forward. "Please, Dr. Fastolfe, 
it is not proper to — " 

"You need not be concerned. 
Commissioner," said Fastolfe, his 
thin lips curving back in something that looked like a smile, but 
wasn't. "I am certain that Daneel's answer will not offend your 



sensibilities or those of Mr. Baley. Won't you tell us, Daneel?" 

R. Daneel said, "Elijah's wife, 
Jessie, left the apartment last 
night on friendly terms with me. 
It was apparent that she had no 
reason for thinking me to be other than human. She returned to 
the apartment knowing I was a 
robot. Quite evidently, the information to that effect exists 
outside the apartment. It followed that my conversation with 
Elijah last night had been overheard. In no other way could the 
secret of my true nature have become common knowledge. 

"Elijah told me that the apartments were well -insulated. Furthermore, we spoke together in 
low voices. Elijah is known as a 
policeman. If a conspiracy exists 
within the City sufficiently wellorganized to have planned the 
murder of Dr. Sarton, it may well 
have been aware that Elijah had 
been placed in charge of the murder investigation. It would fall 
within the realm of possibility 
then, even of probability, that his 
apartment had been spy-beamed. 

"I searched the apartment as 
well as I could after Elijah and 
Jessie had gone to bed, but 
could find no transmitter. This 
complicated matters. A focused 
duo-beam could do the trick even 
in the absence of a transmitter, 
but that requires rathter elaborate 
equipment. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



"Analysis of the situation led 
to the following conclusion. The 
one place where a City-dweller 
can do almost anything without 
being disturbed or questioned is 
in the Personals. He could even 
set up a duo-beam there, for the 
custom of absolute privacy in 
the Personals is very strong and 
other men would not even look at 
him. The Section Personal is 
quite close to Elijah's apartment, 
so that the distance factor is not 
important. A suitcase model 
could be used. I went to the Personal to investigate." 

"And what did you find?" asked Baley quickly. 

"Nothing, Elijah, No sign of a 
duo -beam." 

Dr. Fastolfe said, "Well, Mr. 
Baley, does this sound reasonable to you?" 

T>ALEY'S uncertainty was gone 
now. He said, "Reasonable as 
far as it goes, perhaps, but it 
stops short of perfection by a hell 
of a way. What he doesn't know 
is that my wife told me where 
she got the information and 
when. She learned he was a robot 
shortly after she left the house. 
Even then, the rumor had been 
circulating for hours. So the fact 
that he was a robot could not 
have leaked out through spying 
on our last evening's conversation." 

"Nevertheless/ 1 said Dr. Fas


tolfe, "his action last night of going to the Personal stands explained, I think." 

"But something is brought uj 
that is nor explained," retorted 
Baley. "How did the news gd 
out that there was a Spacer robot 
in the City? As far as I know, 
only two of us knew about the. 
deal, Commissioner Enderby and 
myself, and we told no one. Commissioner, did anyone else in thi 
Department know?" 

"No," said Enderby anxiously 
"Not even the Mayor. Only wi 
and Dr. Fastolfe." 

"And he," added Baley, pointing. 

"I?" asked R. Daneel. "I wa 
with you at all times, Elijah." 

"You were not! I was in th 
Personal for half an hour or mori 
before we went to my apartment 
During that time, we two weij 
completely out of contact witl 
one another. It was then that yen 
got in touch with your group in 
the City." 

"What group?" asked Fastolfe 

And "what group?" echoe< 
Commissioner Enderby almos 
simultaneously. * 

Baley rose from his chair an< 
turned to the trimensic receiver: 
"Commissioner, I want you to 
listen closely to this. A murdef 
is reported. By a curious coin«ffl 
cidence, it happens just as yoifj 
are entering Spacetown to keep.fl 
an appointment with the mur-^ 



106 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIO 



dered man. You are shown the 
corpse of something supposed to 
be human, but the corpse has 
since been disposed of and is not 
available for close examination. 

"The Spacers insist an Earthman did the killing, even though 
the only way they can make such 
an accusation stick is to suppose 
that a City man had left the City 
and cut cross-country to Spacetown alone and at night. You 
know damn well how unlikely 
that is. 

"Next they send a supposed 
robot into the City; in fact, they 
msisr on sending him. The first 
thing the robot does is to threaten 
a crowd of human beings with a 
blaster. The second is to set in 
motion the rumor that there is 
: Spacer robot in the City. The 
rumor is so specific that Jessie 
told me it was known that he was 
working with the police. That 
means that before long it will be 
known that it was the robot who 
handled the blaster. Maybe even 
now, the rumor is spreading 
across the yeast vat country and 
down the Long Island hydroponic 
plants that there's a killer robot 
on the loose." 

"This is impossible! Impossible!" groaned Enderby. 

"It's exactly what's happening, 
Commissioner, Don't you see it? 
There's a conspiracy in the City, 
ill right, but it's run from Spacetown. The Spacers want to be 



able to report a murder. They 
want riots. They want an assault 
on Spacetown. The worse things 
get, the better the incident Then 
Spacer ships can come down and 
occupy the Cities of Earth." 

T\R. FASTOLFE said mildly, 
"We had an excuse to do just 
that during the Barrier riots of 
twenty-five years ago." 

"You weren't ready then. You 
are now." Baley's heart was 
pounding madly. 

"This is quite a complicated 
plot you're attributing to us, Mr. 
Baley. If we wanted to occupy 
Earth, we could do so in much 
simpler fashion." 

"Maybe not, Dr. Fastolf e. Your 
so-called robot told me that public opinion about Earth is by no 
means unified on your Outer 
Worlds. I think he was telling the 
truth at that time, anyway. Maybe an outright occupation would 
not sit well with the people at 
home. Maybe an incident is an 
absolute necessity. A good shocking incident." 

"Like a murder, eh? Is that it? 
Youll admit it would have to be 
a pretended murder. You won't 
suggest, I hope, that we'd really 
kill one of ourselves for the sake 
of an incident." 

"You built a robot to look like 
Dr. Sarton, blasted the robot, 
and showed the remains to Commissioner Enderby." 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



"And then," said Dr. Fastolfe, 
"having used R. Daneel to impersonate Dr. Sarton in the false 
murder, we have to use Dr. Sarton to impersonate R. Daneel in 
the false investigation of the false 
murder." 

"Exactly. I am telling you this 
in the presence of a witness who 
is not here in the flesh and whom 
you cannot blast out of existence 
and who is important enough to 
be believed by the City government and by Washington itself. 
We will be prepared for you and 
we know what your intentions 
are. If necessary, our government 
will report directly to your people, expose the situation for exactly what it is. I doubt if this 
sort of interstellar trickery will 
be tolerated." 

Fastolfe shook his head. "Really, you have the most astonishing 
notions. Suppose now that R. 
Daneel is really R. Daneel, that 
he is actually a robot. Wouldn't 
the corpse that Commissioner 
Enderby saw really be Dr. Sarton? It would be scarcely reasonable to believe that the corpse 
was still another robot. Commissioner Enderby witness R. Daneel 
under construction and can vouch 
for the fact only one existed." 

"If it comes to that," said Baley stubbornly, "the Commissioner is not a robotics expert. You 
might have had a dozen such robots." 

108 I 



"Stick to the point, Mr. Baley. 
What if R. Daneel is R. Daneel? 
Would you have any further 
basis for this completely melodramatic and implausible; 
interstellar plot you have con-, 
structed?" 

"Ii he is a robot! I say he is! 
human. I say no other conclusion 
is possible." 

"Yet you haven't investigated 
the problem, Mr. Baley," said 
Fastolfe. "To differentiate a robot, even a very humanoid robot,' 
from a human being, it isn't 
necessary to make elaborately, 
shaky deductions from little 
things he says or does. For in-« 
stance, have you tried sticking a 
pin into R. Daneel?" 




ALEY'S mouth fell open, 
' "What's that?" 



; "It's a simple experiment 
There are others perhaps not 
quite so simple. His skin and hain 
look real, but have you tried 
looking at them under adequate 
magnification? Then again, he 
seems to breathe, particularly 
when he is using air to talk, but 
have you noticed that his breathi 
ing is irregular, that minutes may 
i go by during which he has no 
breath at all? You might even 
have trapped some of his expired 
air and measured the carbon dU 
i oxide content. You might haVH 
tried to draw a sample of bloocfl

a pulse in his wrist, or a heartbeat under his shirt. Do you see 
what I mean, Mr. Baley?" 

"That's just talk," said Baley 
uneasily. "I'm not going to be 
bluffed. I might have tried any 
of those things, but do you suppose this alleged robot would 
have let me use a hypodermic on 
him, or a stethoscope or a microscope?" 

"I see your point," said Fastolfe. 

He looked at R. Daneel and 
gestured slightly. 

R. Daneel touched the cuff of 
his right shirt sleeve and the 
diamagnetic seam slipped open 
the entire length of his arm. A 
smooth, sinewy and entirely human limb lay exposed. Its short 
bronze hairs, both in quantity 
and distribution, were exactly 
what one would expect of a human being. 

Baley said, "So?" 

R. Daneel squeezed the ball of 
his right middle finger with the 
thumb and forefinger of his left 
hand. Just as the sleeve had 
separated when the diamagnetic 
field of its seam had been interrupted, so the arm itself opened 
along the center. 

Under a thin layer of fleshlike 
material was the dull blue-gray 
of stainless-steel rods, cords and 
joints. 

"Would you care to examine 
Daneel's workings more closely, 



Mr. Baley?" asked Dr. Fastolfe 
politely. 

Baley could scarcely hear the 
remark for the buzzing in his 
ears and the Commissioner's sudden hysterical laughter. 

CHAPTER IX 

THE minutes passed and the 
buzzing grew louder and 
drowned out the laughter. The 
Dome and everything it contained and Baley's time-sense all 
wavered. 

He found himself sitting in an 
unchanged position, but with a 
definite feeling of lost time. The 
Commissioner was gone; the trimensic receiver was milky and 
opaque; and R. Daneel sat at his 
side, pinching up the skin of 
Baley's bared upper arm. Baley 
could see, just beneath the skin, 
the thin dark outline of a hyposliver. It vanished as he watched, 
spreading away into the intercellular fluid, from that into the 
bloodstream and the neighboring 
cells, and then into all the cells 
of his body. 

"Do you feel better, partner 
Elijah?" asked R. Daneel. 

Baley did. He rolled down his 
sleeve and looked about. Dr. 
Fastolfe sat where he had been, 
a small smile softening the homeliness of his face. 

"Did 1 black out?" Baley 
asked. 



THE CAVES OF STIEl 



109 



Dr. Fastolfe said, "You received a sizable shock, I'm 
afraid."' 

It came back quite clearly. 
Baley seized R. Cancel's arm* 
forced up the sleeve as far as it 
would go, exposing the wrist. 
The robot's flesh felt soft to his 
fingers, but underneath was the 
hardness of something more than 
bone, 

R. Daneel let his arm rest 
easily in the plainclothesman's 
grip. Baley stared at it, pinching 
the skin along the median line. 
Was there a faint seam? 

It was logical that there should 
be. A robot, covered with synthetic skin, and deliberately made 
to look human, could not be repaired in. the ordinary fashion. 
A chest plate could not be unriveted. A skull could not be 
hinged up and outward. Instead, 
the various parts of the mechanical body would have to be put 
together along a line of micromagnetic fields. An arm, a head, 
an entire body must fall open at 
the proper touch, then come together again when repaired. 

Baley looked up. "Where's the 
Commissioner?" he mumbled, hot 
with mortification. 

"Pressing business," said Dr. 
Fastolfe. "I encouraged him to 
leave, I'm afraid. I assured him 
we would take care of you." 

"You've taken care of me quite 
nicely already, thank you," said 

110 < 



Baley grimly. "I think our busk 
ness is done." 

He lifted himself erect, feeling 
like an old man very suddenly.' 
Too old to start over again. He 
needed no deep insight to foresee 
that prospect. 

The Commissioner would be 
half-frightened and half-furious. 
He would face Baley whitely, 
taking his glasses off to wipe, 
them every fifteen seconds. His 
soft voice (Julius Enderby almost ■ 
never shouted) would explain 
carefully that the Spacers had 
been mortally offended, 

"You can't talk to Spacers that 
way, Lije. I warned you. If they 
were Earthmen, it would be different. I'd say yes, chance it. 
Run the risk. Smoke them out. 
But Spacers! You might have, 
t consulted me. I know them in 
, side and out." j 

WHAT would Baley be abl 
to say? That Enderby waa 
exactly the man he couldn't tell 
That the project was one oj 
tremendous risk and Enderby I 
man of tremendous caution. Thai 
it had been Enderby himself who 
had pointed out the supreme 
dangers of either outright failun 
or of the wrong kind of success 
i That the one way of defeatini 
i declassification was to show tha 
the guilt lay in Spacetown itseli 
: Enderby would say, "There'] 
1 have to be a report on this, Lij« 

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTICj 



and all sorts of repercussions. 
The Spacers will demand your 
removal from the case and it'll 
have to be that way. You understand that, don*t you? But I'll 
protect you as far as I can, Lije." 

Baley knew that would be exactly true. The Commissioner 
would protect him, but only as 
far as he could — not to the point, 
for instance of infuriating an 
already angry Mayor. 

He could hear the Mayor, too. 
"Damn it, Enderby, who's running the City? Why was an unauthorized robot allowed inside? 
And just what the devil did this 
Baley—" 

If it came to a decision between Baley's future in the Department and the Commissioner's 
own, what possible choice could 
Baley expect? He could find no 
reasonable way of blaming Enderby. 

The least he could expect was 
demotion and that was bad 
enough. The mere act of living in 
a modern City insured the bare 
possibility of existence, even for 
those entirely declassified. How 
bare that possibility was, he knew 
only too well. 

It was the addition of status 
that brought the little things: a 
more comfortable seat here, a 
better cut of meat there, a shorter wait in line at the other place. 
To the philosophical mind, these 
items might seem scarcely worth 



any great trouble to acquire. 

Yet no one, however philosophical, could give up those 
privileges, once acquired, without a pang. That was the point. 

What a trifling addition to the 
convenience of the apartment a 
wash-basin was when, for thirty 
years, the trip to Personals had 
been an automatic and unregarded one. How useless it was even 
as a device to prove "status" 
when it was considered the height 
of ill-form to parade "status." 
Yet were the wash-basin to be 
removed, how humiliating and 
unbearable would each trip to 
Personals be! How yearningly attractive the memory of the bedroom shave! How filled with a 
sense of lost luxury! 

TT was fashionable . for modern 
political writers to look back 
with smug disapproval at the 
"Fiscalism" of Medieval times, 
when economy had been based 
on money. The competitive struggle for existence, they said, was 
brutal. No truly complex society 
could survive the eternal "fightfor the buck." (Scholars had 
varying interpretations of the 
word "buck," but there was no 
dispute over the meaning as a 
whole.) 

By contrast, modern "Civism" 
was praised as efficient and enlightened. 

Maybe so. There were histor

ical novels both in the romantic 
and the sensational tradition and 
the Medievalists thought "Fiscalism" had bred such things as individualism and initiative. 

Baley wondered sickly if ever 
a man fought harder for that 
buck, whatever it was, than a 
City-dweller fought to keep from 
losing his Sunday night option on 
a chicken drumstick — a realflesh drumstick from a onceliving bird. 

Baley thought: Not me so 
much. There's Jessie and Ben. 

Dr. Fastolfe's voice broke in 
upon his thoughts. "Mr. Baley, 
do you hear me?" 

Baley blinked. "Yes?" How 
long had he been standing there 
like a frozen fool? 

"Won't you sit down, sir? Having attended to the matter on 
your mind, you may now be interested in the films we took of 
the scene of the crime." 

"No, thank you. I have business in the City." 

"Surely the ease of Dr. Sarton 
comes first." 

"Not with me. I imagine I'm 
off the case already." Suddenly, 
he boiled over. "Damn it, why 
didn't you prove R. Daneel was 
a robot right away? Why did 
you let me make a fool of myself?" 

"My dear Mr. Baley, I was interested in your deductions. As 
for your being off the case, I 

112 l 



made a special point of asking 
the Commissioner that you be retained. I believe he will cooperate." 

Baley sat down, not entirely 
voluntarily. He said sharply, 
"Why?" 

Dr. Fastolfe crossed his legs 
and sighed. "Mr. Baley, in general I have met two kinds of 
City-dwellers, rioters and politicians. Your Commissioner is 
useful to us, but he is a politician. 
He handles us, if you know what 
I mean. You came here and boldly accused us of tremendous 
crimes and tried to prove your 
case. I found it a hopeful development." 

"How hopeful?" asked Baley 
sardonically. 

"Hopeful enough. You are* 
someone I can deal with frankly. 
Last night, Mr. Baley, R. Daneel 
reported to me by shielded subether. Some things about you in- ' 
terested me very much. For 
instance, there was the point concerning the nature of the book- .: 
films in your apartment." 

"What about them?" 

"A good many dealt with historical and archeological subjects. 
It makes it appear that you are 
interested in human society and 
that you know a little about its 
evolution." 

"Even policemen can spend 
their free time on book-films, if 
they choose." ,i

"4~|UITE," agreed Dr. Fastolfe. 
\£ "I'm glad of your choice of 
viewing matter. It will help me 
in what I am trying to do. In 
the first place, I want to explain, 
or try to, the exclusivism of the 
men of the Outer Worlds. We 
live here in Spacetown; we don't 
enter the City; we mingle with 
you City-dwellers only in a very 
rigidly limited fashion. I sit here 
now with filters in my nostrils, 
gloves on my hands, and a fixed 
determination to come no closer 
to you than I can help. Why do 
you suppose that is?" 

Baley said, "There's no point 
in guessing." Let him talk now. 

"If you guessed as some of 
your people do, you would say 
that it was because we despised 
the men of Earth and refused to 
lose caste by allowing their shadow to fall upon us. That is not 
so. The medical examination you 
went through, as well as the 
cleansing procedures, were not 
matters of ritual. They were dictated by necessity." 

"Disease?" 

"Yes, disease. The Earthmen 
who colonized the Outer Worlds 
found themselves on planets entirely free of terrestrial bacteria 
and viruses. They brought in 
their own, of course, but they 
also brought with them the latest medical and microbiological 
techniques. They had a small 
community of micro-organisms 



to deal with and no intermediate 
hosts, such as mosquitoes to 
spread malaria, snails to spread 
schistosomiasis. Disease agents 
were wiped out and symbiotic 
bacteria allowed to grow. The 
Outer Worlds became diseasefree. Naturally, as time went on, 
entrance requirements for immigrant Earthmen were made more 
and more rigorous, since less and 
less could the Outer Worlds resist disease." 

"You've never been sick. Dr. 
Fastolfe?" 

"Not with a parasitic disease. 
We are all liable to degenerative 
diseases, but I have never had a 
cold. If I were to contract one, 
I might die of it, having built 
up no resistance to it whatsoever. 
Those of us who come here run 
a great risk. Earth is riddled with 
diseases to which we have no defense, no natural defense. You 
yourself are carrying the germs 
of almost every known disease. 
You are not aware of it, since 
you keep them under control at 
almost all times through the antibodies your body has developed 
over the years. We lack the antibodies. Do you wonder that I 
come no closer to you? Believe 
me, Mr. Baley, I act aloof only 
in self-defense." 

Baley said, "If tftis is so, why 
isn't the fact made known on 
Earth? I mean that it is not just 
queasiness on your part, but a 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



113 



defense against an actual physical danger." 

The Spacer shook his head. 
"We are few, Mr. Baley, and are 
disliked as foreigners anyway. 
We maintain our own safety on 
the basis of a rather shaky prestige as a superior class of being. 
We cannot afford to lose face by 
admitting that we are afraid to 
approach an Earthman. Not, at 
least, until there is a better understanding between Earthmen 
and Spacers." 

"There won't be on the present 
terms. It's your supposed superiority that we — they hate you 
for." 

"It is a dilemma. Don't think 
we aren't aware of it." 

"Does the Commissioner know 
of this?" 

"We have never explained it to 
him flatly, as I have just done 
to you. He may guess it, however. 
He is quite an intelligent man." 

"If he guessed it, he might have 
told me," Baley said reflectively. 

r\R. Fastolfe lifted his eye" brows. "If he had, then you 
wouldn't have considered the 
possibility of R. Daneel being a 
human Spacer. Is that it?" 

Baley shrugged slightly. 

But Dr. Fastolfe went on, 
"That's quite true, you know. 
Putting the psychological difficulties to one side, the terrible 
effect of the noise and crowds 



upon us, the fact remains that 
for one of us to enter the City 
is the equivalent of a death sentence. It is why Dr. Sarton initiated his project of humanoid 
robots. They were substitute men, 
designed to enter the City instead 
of us — " 

"R. Daneel explained it to me," 

"Do you disapprove?" 

"Look," said Baley, "since 
we're talking to one another so 
freely, let me ask a question in 
simple words. Why have you 
Spacers come to Earth anyway? 
Why don't you leave us alone?" 

Dr. Fastolfe said, with obvious 
surprise, "Are you satisfied with 
life on Earth?" 

"We get along." 

"Yes, but how long will that 
continue? Your population goes 
up continuously; the available 
calories meet the needs only as a 
result of greater and greater 
effort. Earth is up a blind alley." 

"We get along," Baley repeated stubbornly. 

"Barely. A City like New York 
must spend every ounce of effort 
getting water in and waste out. 
The nuclear power plants are 
kept going by uranium supplies 
that are constantly more difficult 
to obtain even from the other 
planets of the Solar System, and 
the supply needed goes up steadily. The life of the City depends 
every moment on the arrival of 
wood-pulp for the yeast vats and 



114 



OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION : 



minerals for the hydroponic 
plants. Air must be circulated unceasingly. The balance is a very 
delicate one in a hundred directions, and growing more delicate 
each year. What would happen to 
New York if the tremendous flow 
of input and outgo were to be 
interrupted for even a single 
hour?" 

"It never has been." Baley 
was on the defensive. 

"Which is no security for the 
future. In primitive times, individual population centers were 
virtually self-supporting, living 
on the produce of neighboring 
farms. Nothing but immediate 
disaster, a flood or a pestilence 
or crop failure, could harm them. 
As the centers grew and technology improved, localized disasters could be overcome by 
drawing on help from distant 
centers, but at the cost of making 
even larger areas interdependent. 
In Medieval times, the open 
cities, even the largest, could subsist on food stores and on emergency supplies of all sorts for a 
week at least. When New York 
first became a City, it could have 
lived on itself for a day- Now it 
cannot do so for an hour. A disaster that would have been uncomfortable ten thousand years 
ago and merely serious a thousand years ago and acute a hundred years ago would now be 
fatal." 



TJALEY moved restlessly in his 
chair. "I've heard all this before. The Medievalists want an 
end to Cities. They want us to 
get back to the soil and to natural agriculture. Well, they're 
mad; we can't. There are too 
many of us and you can't go 
backward in history, only forward. Of course, if emigration to 
the Outer Worlds were not restricted — " 

"You know why it must be." 

"Then we have to go on as we ' 
are." 

"What about emigration to new 
worlds? There are a hundred billion stars in the Galaxy. It is 
estimated that there are a hundred million planets that can be 
inhabited." 

"That*s ridiculous." 

"Why?" asked Dr. Fastolfe, 
with vehemence. "Why is the suggestion ridiculous? Thirty of the 
fifty Outer Worlds, including my 
native Aurora, were directly colonized by Earthmen. Is colonization no longer possible?'* 

"Well—" 

"If it is no longer possible, it 
is because of the development of 
City culture on Earth, Before 
the Cities, human life on Earth 
wasn't so specialized that men 
couldn't break loose and start all 
over on a raw world. They did it 
thirty times. But now Earthmen 
are so enwombed in their imprisoning caves of steel that they 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



115 



dare not leave. You, Mr. Baley, 
won't even believe that a Citydweller is capable of crossing 
country to get to Spacetown. 
Crossing space to get to a new 
world must represent impossibility squared to you. City civilization is ruining Earth!" 

Baley said angrily, "And if it 
does, how does that concern you 
people? It's our problem." 

"I know how you feel. It is not 
pleasant to listen to the preaching of a stranger. Yet I wish your 
people could preach to us for we, 
too, have a problem — one that is 
analogous to yours." 

Baley smiled crookedly. "Overpopulation?" 

"Analogous, not identical. Ours 
is underpopulation. How old do 
you think I am?" 

The Earthman considered for 
a moment and then deliberately 
overestimated. "Sixty, I'd say." 

"A hundred and sixty, you 
should say." 

"What!" 

"A hundred and sixty-three 
next birthday, to be exact, and 
I'm using the standard Earth 
year as the unit. If I'm fortunate, 
if I take care of myself, most 
of all, if I catch no disease on 
Earth, I may double that age. 
People on Aurora have been 
known to live over three hundred 
and fifty years. And life expectancy is still increasing." 

Baley looked to R. Daneel 



(who throughout the conversation had been listening in stolid 
silence), as though he were seeking confirmation. 

HE said, "How is that possible?" 

"In an underpopulated society," replied Dr. Fastolfe, "it is 
practical to concentrate research 
on the aging process. In a world 
such as yours, a lengthened life 
expectancy would be disastrous. 
You couldn't afford the resulting 
rise in population. On Aurora, 
there is room for tricentenarians. 
Then, of course, a long life becomes doubly and triply precious. 
If you were to die now, you would 
lose perhaps forty years of your 
life, probably less. If I were to 
die, I would lone a hundred and 
fifty years, probably more. In a 
culture such as ours, then, individual life is of prime importance. Our birth rate is low and 
population increase is rigidly 
controlled. We maintain a definite robot man ratio designed to 
maintain the individual in the 
greatest comfort. Logically, developing children are carefully 
screened for physical and mental 
defects before being allowed to 
mature." 

Baley interrupted. "You mean 
you kill them if they don't — " 

"If they don't measure upQuite painlessly, I assure you. 
The notion shocks you. But the' 



116 




 



Earthman's uncontrolled breeding shocks us just as much." 

"We're controlled, Dr, Fastolfe, 
Each family is allowed only so 
many children." 

Dr. Fastolfe smiled tolerantly. 
"So many of any kind of children; not so many healthy children." 

"Who's to judge?" 

"That's rather complicated and 
not to be answered in a sentence. 
Some day we may talk it over." 

"Well, Where's yout problem? 
You sound satisfied with your 
society.'' 

"It is stable. That's the trouble. 
It is too stable." 

T>ALEY said, "Nothing pleases 
you. Our civilization is too 
close to the ragged edge of chaos, 
according to you, and your own 
isn't close enough." 

"It is possible to be too stable. 
No Outer World has colonized 
a new planet in two and a half 
centuries. There is no prospect for 
colonization in tlte future. Our 
lives in the Outer Worlds are too 
long to risk and too comfortable 
to upset." 

"You've come to Earth. You 
risk disease." 

"There are some of us, Mr. 
Baley, who feel that the future 
of the human race is even worth 
the possible loss of an extended 
lifetime. Too few of us, I am 
sorry to say." 



"All right, we're coming to the 
point. How is Spacetown helping 
matters?" 

"In trying to introduce robots 
here on Earth, we're doing our 
best to upset the balance of your 
City economy." 

"That's your way of helping?" 
Baley's lips quivered. "You mean 
you're creating a growing group 
of displaced and declassified men 
on purpose?" 

"Not out of cruelty or callousness, believe me. A group of displaced men, as you call them, are 
what we need to serve as a nucleus for colonization. Your 
ancient America was discovered 
by ships fitted out with men from 
the prisons. Don't you see that 
the City's womb has failed the 
displaced man? He has nothing 
to lose and worlds to gain by 
leaving Earth." 

"But it isn't working." Baley 
frowned thoughtfully. 

"No, it isn't," said Dr. Fastolfe, 
sadly. "There is something 
wrong. The resentment of the 
Earthman for the robot blocks 
things. Yet those very robots can 
accompany humans, smooth the 
difficulties of initial adjustment 
to a raw world, make colonization 
practical." 

"Then what? More Outer 
Worlds?" 

"No. The Outer Worlds were 
established before the Cities had 
spread over Earth. The new col


THE CAVE5 OF STEEL 



117 



onies will be built by humans 
who have the City background 
plus the beginnings of a C/Fe 
culture. It will be a synthesis. A 
carbon iron symbiosis. As it 
stands now. Earth's own structure must go ricketing down in 
the near future, the Outer Worlds 
will slowly degenerate and decay 
in a somewhat further future, but 
the new colonies will be a new 
and healthy strain, combining 
the best of both cultures. By their 
reaction upon the older worlds, 
including Earth, we ourselves 
may gain new life." 

"I don't know. It's all very 
vague, Dr. Fastolfe." 

"A dream, yes, but a sharply 



detailed one. Think about it." 
Abruptly the Spacer rose to his 
feet. "I have spent more time 
with you than I intended. In 
fact, more time than our health 
ordinances allow. You will excuse me?" 

WITH R. Daneel, Baley left 
the dome. Sunlight, at a 
different angle, somewhat yellower, washed down upon them once 
again. Baley wondered uneasily 
whether sunlight might not seem 
different on another world. Less 
harsh and brazen, perhaps. More 
acceptable. 

Another world? The homely 
Spacer with the prominent ears 





 



had filled his mind with queer 
imaginings. Did the doctors of 
Aurora once look at the child 
Fastolfe and wonder if he ought 
to be allowed to mature? Wasn't 
he too ugly? Or did their criteria 
include physical appearance at 
all? When did ugliness become a 
deformity and what deformities — 

But when the sunlight vanished and they entered the first 
door that led to the Personal, 
the mood became harder to maintain. 

Baley shook his head with exasperation. Forcing Earthmen to 
emigrate, to set up a new society! It was nonsense! What 
were these Spacers really after? 

He thought about it and came 
to no conclusion. 

Slowly, their squad-car rolled 
down the vehicular lane. Reality 
was surging all about Baley. His 
blaster was a warm and comfortable weight against his hip. The 
noise and vibrant life of the City 
were just as warm, just as comfortable. 

For a moment, as the City 
closed in, his nose tingled to a 
slight and fugitive pungence. 

He thought wonderingly: The 
City smells, 

He thought of the twenty million human beings crammed into 
the steel walls of the great cave 
and for the first time in his life 
he smelled them with nostrils that 



had been washed clean by outdoor air. 

He thought; Would it be different on another world? Less 
people and more air — cleaner? 

But the afternoon roar of the 
City was all around them, the 
smell faded and was gone and 
he felt a little ashamed of himself. 

He let the drive-rod in slowly 
and tapped a larger share of the 
beamed power. The squad-car 
accelerated sharply as it slanted 
down into the empty Motorway. 

"Daneel," he said. 
"Yes, Elijah?" 

"Why was Dr. Fastolfe telling 
me all that?" 

"We are not here just to solve 
a murder, but to save Spacetown 
and, with it, the future of the 
human race." 

Baley said drily, "I think he'd 
have been better off if he'd let 
me see the scene of the crime 
and interview the men who first 
found the body." 

"I doubt if you could have 
added anything, Elijah. We have 
been quite thorough." 

"Have you? You've got nothing. Not a clue. Not a suspect." 

"No, you are right. The answer must be in the City. To be 
accurate, though, we did have one 
suspect." 

"What? You said nothing of 
this before." 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



119 



"I did not feel it to be necessary, Elijah. Surely it is obvious 
to you that one suspect automatically existed." 

"In the devil's name, who?" 

"The one Earthman who was 
on the scene. Commissioner 
Julius Enderby," 

CHAPTER X 

rriHE squad-car veered to one 
side, halted against the concrete wall of the Motorway. With 
the humming of its motor stopped, the silence was dead and 
thick. 

Baley looked at the robot next 
to him and asked in an incongruously quiet voice, "What did you 
say?" 

Time stretched while Baley 
waited for an answer. A small 
and lonesome vibration rose and 
reached a minor peak, then faded. 
It was the sound of another 
squad-car, boring its way past 
them on some unknown errand, 
perhaps a mile away. Or else it 
was a fire-car hurrying along toward its own appointment with 
combustion. 

A detached portion of Baley's 
mind wondered if any one man 
any longer knew all the Motorways that twisted about in New 
York City's bowels. At no time 
in the day or night could the 
entire Motorway system be completely empty, and yet there must 



be individual passages that no 
man had entered in years. With 
sudden, devastating clarity, he 
remerdbered a short story he r^ad 
viewed as a youngster. 

It concerned the Motorways of 
London and began, quietly 
enough, with a murder. The murderer fled toward a prearranged 
hideout in the corner of a Motorway in whose dust his own shoeprints had been the only 
disturbance for a century. In that 
abandoned hole, he could wait in 
complete safety till the search 
died. 

But he took a wrong turning 
and in the silence and loneness 
of those twisting corridors he 
swore a blaspheming oath that 
he would yet reach his haven. 

From that time on, no turning 
was right. He wandered through 
an unending maze from the 
Brighton sector on the Channel 
to Norwich and from Coventry to 
Canterbury. He burrowed endlessly beneath the great City of 
London from end to end of its 
sprawl across the southeastern 
corner of Medieval England. His 
clothes were rags and his shoes 
ribbons, his strength wore down 
but never left him. He was tired, 
tired, yet unable to stop. 

Sometimes he heard the sound 
of passing cars, but they were 
always in the next corridor, and 
however fast he rushed (for he 
would gladly have given himself 



120 




 



up by then), the corridors he 
reached were always empty. 
Sometimes he saw an exit far 
ahead that would lead to the 
City's life and breath, but it always glimmered farther away as 
he approached until he would 
turn — and it would be gone. 

Occasionally, Londoners on 
official business through the underground would see a misty figure limping silently toward them, 
a semi-transparent arm lifted in 
pleading, a mouth open and moving, but soundless. As it approached, it would waver and 
vanish. 

It was a story that had lost 
the attributes of ordinary fiction 
and had entered the realm of 
folklore. The "Wandering Londoner" had become a familiar 
phrase to all the world. 

In the depths of New York 
City, Baley remembered the 
story and stirred uneasily. 

RDANEEL spoke antl there 
• was a small echo to his 
voice. He said, "We may be overheard." 

"Down here? Not a chance. 
Now what was that you said 
about the Commissioner?" 

"He was on the scene, ElijahHe is a City-dweller. He was 
inevitably a suspect." 

"Was? You mean he isn't a 
suspect now?" 

"His innocence was quickly 



established. For one thing, there 
was no blaster in his possession. 
There could not very well be one. 
He had entered Spacetown in the 
usual fashion and you know 
blasters are removed as a matter 
of course." 

"Was the murder weapon 
found at all?" 

"No, Elijah. Every blaster in 
Spacetown was examined and 
none had been fired for weeks." 

"Then whoever had committed 
the murder had either hidden the 
weapon so well — " 

"It could not have been hidden 
anywhere in Spacetown." 

Baley said impatiently, "I'm 
trying to consider all possibilities. 
It was either hidden or it was 
carried away ,by the murderer 
when he left." 

"Exactly." 

"And if you admit only the 
second possibility, then the Commissioner is cleared." 

"Yes. As a precaution, of 
course, he was cerebroanalyzed." 

"He was what?" 

"The interpretation of the electromagnetic fie'lds of the living 
brain cells." 

"Oh," said Baley, unenlightened. "And what does that tell 
you?" 

"It gives us information concerning the temperamental and 
emotional makeup of an individual. In the case of Commissioner 
Enderby, it told us that he was 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



121 



incapable of killing Dr. Sarton." 

"I could have told you that." 

"It is better to have objective 
information. Naturally, our people in Spacetown allowed themselves to be cerebroanalyzed as 
well." 

"All incapable, I suppose." 

"Beyond question. That is why 
we know that the murderer must 
be a City-dweller." 

"Well, then, all we have to do 
is put the whole City through 
your cute little process." 

"It would not be very practical, Elijah. There might be millions temperamentally capable of 
the deed." 

"Millions," grunted Baley, 
thinking of the crowds that long 
ago day who had screamed at 
the "dirty Spacers," and of 
the threatening and slobbering 
crowds outside the shoe store the 
night before. 

He thought: Poor Julius. A 
suspect! 

He could hear the Commissioner's voice describing the 
period after the discovery of the 
body: '"It was brutal, brutal." 
No wonder he had broken his 
glasses in shock and dismay. No 
wonder he did not want to return to Spacetown. "I hate 
them," he had ground out between his teeth. 

Poor Julius, The man who 
could handle Spacers. The man 
whose greatest value to the City 



lay in his ability to get along 
with them. How much had that 
contributed to his rapid promotions? 

No wonder the Commissioner 
had wanted Baley to take over. 
Good old loyal, close-mouthed 
Baley. College chum! He would 
keep quiet if he found out about 
that little incident. Baley wondered how cerebroanalysis was 
done. He imagined huge' electrodes, busy pantographs skidding inklines across graphed 
paper. 

Poor Julius. He must already 
be seeing himself at the end of 
his career with a forced letter of 
resignation in the hands of the 
Mayor. 

The squad-car slanted up into 
the sub-levels of City Hall. 

¥T was 14:30 when Baley ar-1 rived back at his desk. The 
Commissioner was out. R. Sammy, grinning his mechanical grin, 
did not know where the Commissioner was. 

Baley spent some time thinking. The fact that he was hungry 
didn't register. 

At 15:20 R. Sammy came to 
his desk and said, "The Commissioner is in now, Lije." 

Baley said, "Thanks." 

For once he listened to R. 
Sammy without being annoyed. 
R. Sammy, after all, was a kind 
of relation to R. Daneel, and R. 



122 



 



Daneel obviously wasn't a person — or thing, rather — to get annoyed with. Baley wondered how 
it would be on a new planet with 
men and robots starting even 
about a City culture. He considered the situation quite dispassionately. 

The Commissioner was going 
through some documents as 
Baley entered, stopping occasionally to make notations. 

He said, "That was a giantsize blooper you pulled out in 
Spacetown." 

■pOR a moment, Baley felt puz*■ zled. Then it hit him with 
shocking impact. Jehoshaphat, 
how had he forgotten the verbal 
duel with Fastolfe! 

His long face took on a lugubrious expression of chagrin. 
"I'll say I did, Commissioner. 
I'm sorry." 

Enderby looked up. His expression was keen and his eyes 
glanced firmly through their 
glass barriers. He seemed more 
himself than at any time these 
thirty hours. He said, "Fastolfe 
didn't seem to mind, so well forget it. Unpredictable, these Spacers. You don't deserve your luck, 
Lije. Next time, talk it over with 
me before you make like a subether hero." 

Baley nodded. He had tried a 
grandstand stunt and it hadn't 
worked. Okay. He was a little 



surprised that he could be so 
casual about it, but there it was. 

He said, "Look, Commissioner. 
I want to have a two-man apartment assigned to Daneel and myself. I'm not taking him home 
tonight." 

"What's all this?" 

"The news is out that he's a 
robot. Remember? Maybe nothing will happen, but if there is 
a riot, I don't want my family 
in the middle of it." 

"Nonsense, Lije. I've had the 
thing checked. There's no such 
rumor in the City." 

"Jessie got the story somewhere. Commissioner." 

"Well, there's no organized 
rumor. Nothing dangerous. I've 
been checking this ever since I 
got off the trimensic at Fastolfe's 
dome, which was why I left. I 
had to track it down fast. There's 
Doris Gillid's report. She went 
through a dozen Women's Personals in different parts of the 
City, You know Doris. She's a 
competent girl. Well, nothing 
showed anywhere. Not a thing." 

"Then how did Jessie get the 
rumor?" 

"It can be explained. R. Daneel 
made a display of himself in 
the shoe store. Did he really pull 
a blaster, Lije, or were you 
stretching the facts a little — just 
a little, perhaps?" 

"He really pulled one. Pointed 
it, too."

COMMISSIONER Enderby 
shook his head. "All right. 
Someone recognized him. As a 
robot, I mean." 

"Hold on," said Baley indignantly. "You can't tell he's a 
robot." 

"Why not?" 

"Could you? I couldn't." 

"We're no experts. Suppose 
there was a technician out of the 
Westchester robot factories in the 
crowd, a man who has spent his 
life building and designing robots. He notices something queer 
about R. Daneel. Maybe in the 
way he talks or holds himself. 
He speculates about it. Maybe 
he tells his wife. She tells a few 
friends. Then it dies because people don't believe it. Only it got 
to Jessie before it died." 

"Maybe," said Baley doubtfully. "But how about an assignment to a bachelor room for two, 
anyway?" 

The Commissioner shrugged, 
lifted the intercom. After a while, 
he said, "Section Q-27 is all they 
can do. It's not a very good 
neighborhood." 

"It'll do," said Baley. 

"Where's R. Daneel now, by 
the way?" 

"He's at our record files, trying to collect information on 
Medievalist agitators." 

"But there are millions!" 

"I know, but it keeps him 
happy." 

124 



Baley was nearly at the door 
when he turned, half on impulse, 
and said, "Commissioner, did Dr. 
Sarton ever talk to you about 
Spacetown's program? I mean 
about introducing the C/Fe culture?" 

"The what?" 
"Introducing robots." 
"Occasionally." 

"Did he ever explain what 
Spacetown's purpose was?" 

"Oh, improve health, raise the 
standard of living. The usual 
stuff. I nodded my head and all 
that. It's just a matter of humoring them and hoping they'll keep 
their ideas within reason. Maybe 
some day — " 

Baley waited, but Enderby 
didn't say what particular maybe 
some day might bring. 

Baley said, "Did he ever mention anything to you about emigration?" 

"Emigration? Never! Letting 
an Earthman into an Outer 
World is like finding a diamond 
asteroid in the rings of Saturn." 

"I mean emigration to new 
worlds." 

But the Commissioner answered that one with a simple 
stare of incredulous horror. 
Baley said with sudden blunti ness, "What's cerebroanalysis, 
Commissioner? Ever hear of it?" 
The Commissioner's round face 
i showed only polite interest. "No. 
What's it supposed to be?" 

OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Nothing. Just picked it up." 

Baley left the office and at 
his desk continued thinking. Certainly the Commissioner wasn't 
that good an actor. 

AT 16:05, Baley called Jessie 
and told her he wouldn't be 
home that night or probably any 
night for a while. 

"Lije, is there trouble?" she 
asked anxiously. "Are you in 
danger?" 

"A policeman is always in a 
certain amount of danger," he explained lightly. It didn't satisfy 
her. 

"Where will you be staying?" 

He didn't tell her. "If you're 
going to be lonely tonight," he 
said, "stay at your mother's." 
He broke the connection abruptly, which was probably just as 
well. 

At 16:20, he made a call to 
Washington. It took a long time 
to reach the man he wanted and 
an almost equally long time to 
convince him he ought to make 
an air-trip to New York the next 
day. By 16:40, he had succeeded. 

At 16:55, the Commissioner 
left, passing him with an uncertain smile. The day shift departed 
en masse. The skeleton night 
shift made its way in and greeted 
him in varied tones of surprise. 

R. Daneel came to his desk 
with a thick sheaf of papers. 
"This is a list of men and women 



who might belong to a Medievalist organization, Elijah." 

Baley shook his head. "Can't 
be. It's too small." 

"But there are over a million 
names here!" 

"Listen, Daneel. Almost all 
Earthmen are Medievalists in 
one way or another. Look at the 
Commissioner's — " he almost 
said "spectacles," then remembered that Earthmen must stick 
together, the Commissioner's face 
must be protected in the figurative as well as the literal sense — 
"eye -ornaments." 

"Yes," said R. Daneel, "I had 
noticed them, but thought it perhaps indelicate to refer to them. 
I have not seen such ornaments 
on other City-dwellers." 

"It is a very old-fashioned sort 
of thing." 

"Does it serve a purpose of 
any sort?" 

"Usually. Daneel, how did you 
get your list?" 

"A machine did it for me. Apparently, one sets it for a particular type of offense and it 
does the rest. I let it scan all 
disorderly conduct cases involving robots over the jpast twentyfive years. Another machine 
scanned all City Newspapers for 
those who made unfavorable 
statements concerning robots or 
men of the Outer Worlds. It is 
amazing what can be done in 
three hours. The machine even 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



125 



eliminated the names of nonsurvivors from the lists." 

"You are amazed? Surely 
you've got computers on the 
Outer Worlds." 

"Very advanced ones. But 
none are as massive and complex 
as the ones here. You must remember, of course, that even the 
largest Outer World scarcely has 
the population of one of your 
Cities and so extreme complexity 
is not necessary." 

"Have you ever been on 
Aurora?" 

"No," said R. Daneel. "I was 
assembled here on Earth." 

"Then how do you know about 
Outer World computers?" 

"My data store was drawn 
from Dr. Sarton." 

"I see. Can you eat, Daneel?" 

"I am nuclear-powered. I had 
thought you were aware of that." 

"I didn't ask if you needed to 
eat. I asked if you could eat — 
put food in your mouth, chew it 
and swallow it. I should think 
that would be important in seeming to be a man." 

"I see your point. Yes, I can 
perform the mechanical operations of chewing and swallowing. 
Naturally, I would eventually 
have to remove the merely macerated food from what you might 
call my stomach." 

"All right. You can do that 
in the privacy of our room tonight. I've missed lunch, damn 



it, and I want you with me when 
I eat. And you can't sit there 
and nor eat without attracting 
attention." 

"Very well," said R. Daneel. 
"I shall be glad to — eat — with 
you." 

SECTION kitchens were the 
same all over the City. What's 
more, Baley had been in Washington, Toronto, Buenos Aires, 
London, Canton and Durban in 
line of duty, and they had been 
the same there, too. Perhaps it 
had been different in Medieval 
times when languages and diets 
had varied. Nowadays, yeast 
products were identical everywhere; and English might not be 
the "English" of Shakespeare or 
Churchill, but it was the final 
potpourri that was current over 
all the continents and, with some 
modification, on the Outer 
Worlds as well. 

Language and dietary aside, 
there were the deeper similarities. There was always that particular odor, undefinable but 
completely ., characteristic, of 
"kitchen." There was the waiting 
triple line moving slowly in, converging at the door and splitting 
up again; right, left, center. 
There was the rumble of humanity, speaking and moving, and 
the sharper clatter of plastic on 
plastic. There was the gleam of 
simulated wood, highly polished; 



126 




 



highlights on glass; long tables; 
the touch of steam in the air. 

Baley inched forward as the 
line moved. With all possible 
staggering of meal hours, a wait 
of at least ten minutes was almost unavoidable. He said to R. 
Daneel in sudden curiosity, "Can 
you smile?" 

R. Daneel had been gazing at 
the interior of the kitchen with 
cool absorption. He turned and 
smiled. That is, his lips curled 
back and the skin about either 
end folded. Only the mouth 
smiled, however. The rest of the 
robot's face was unchanged. 

Baley looked away. "Don't 
bother. It doesn't do a thing for 
you." 

They were at the entrance. 
Person after person thrust a metal 
food-tag through the appropriate 
slot and had it scanned. Click — 
click — click — 

A smoothly running kitchen 
could allow the entrance of two 
hundred persons a minute, the 
tags of each one being fully 
scanned to prevent kitchen-jumping, meal -jumping and ration stretching. But that was at 
maximum efficiency, which was 
lost when any one person required special treatment, like stepping to the manual window, as 
Baley and R. Daneel did, in order 
to thrust a special permit pass at 
the official in charge. 

Jessie, an assistant dietitian be


fore she'd married Baley, had explained it once to him. 

"It upsets things completely, 
throws off consumption figures 
and inventory estimates. It means 
special checks. You have to 
match slips with all the different 
Section kitchens to make sure 
the balance isn't too unbalanced, 
if you know what I mean. There's 
a separate balance sheet to be 
made out each week. Then if 
anything goes wrong and you're 
overdrawn, it's always your fault. 
It's never the fault of the City for 
passing out special tickets to 
everybody and his kid sister. Oh, 
no. And when we have to say 
that free choice is suspended for 
the meal, don't the people in line 
make a fuss! It's always the 
fault of the people behind the 
counter — " 

T7-NOWING this, Baley understood the dry and poisonous 
look he received from the woman 
behind the window. She made a 
few hurried notes. Home Section, 
occupation; reason for meal displacement ("official business," a 
very irritating reason, but irrefutable). Then she folded the slip 
and pushed it into a slot. A computer seized it, devoured the 
contents and digested the information. 

Finished with Baley, she turned to R. Daneel. 

Baley jumped in hurriedly. He 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



127 



said, "My friend is out-of-City." 

The woman looked finally 
and completely outraged. "Home 
City, please," she asked through 
clamped teeth. 

Baley intercepted for Daneel 
once again. "All records are to be 
credited to the Police Department. No details necessary. Official business." 

The woman brought down a 
pad of slips with an angry slam 
and filled in the data in darklight code with savage pressure 
of the first two fingers of her 
right hand. 

"How long will you be eating 
here?" 

"Till further notice," said 
Baley. 
"Press here." 

Baley had a short qualm as R. 
Daneel's even fingers with their 
glistening nails pushed downward. Surely they wouldn't have 
forgotten to supply him with 
fingerprints. 

The woman took the blank 
away and fed it into the machine near her elbow. 'It belched 
nothing back and Baley breathed 
more easily. 

She gave them little metal tags 
that were in the bright red that 
meant "temporary." 

She said, "No free choices. 
We're short this week. Take table 
DF." 

They made their way toward 
DF. 



R. Daneel said, "I am under 
the impression that most of your 
people eat regularly in kitchens 
such as these." 

"Yes. Of course, it's rather 
gruesome eating in a strange 
kitchen. There's no one you 
know. In your own kitchen, you 
have your own seat and you're 
with your family and your 
friends. Especially when you're 
young, mealtimes are the bright 
spot of the day." Baley smiled 
in brief reminiscence. 

Table DF was apparently reserved for transients. Those already seated watched their plates 
and did not talk with one another. They looked with sneaking envy at the laughing crowds. 

There is no one so uncomfortable, thought Baley, as the 
man eating out-of-Section. Be it 
ever so humble, the old saying 
went, there's no place like homekitchen. Even the food tastes 
better, no matter how many 
chemists are ready to swear it to 
be no different from the food in 
Johannesburg. 

HE sat down on a stool and 
R. Daneel took one next to 

him. 

"No free choice," said Baley, 
"so just close the switch there 
and wait." 

It took two minutes. A disc 
slid back in the table top and a 
dish lifted. 



12S 




 



"Mashed potatoes, zymoveal 
sauce and stewed apricots. Oh, 
well," Baley said. 

A fork and two slices of whole 
yeast bread appeared in a recess 
just in front of the low railing 
that went down the long center 
of the table. 

R. Daneel said in a low voice, 
"You may help yourself to my 
serving, if you wish." 

For a moment, Baley was 
scandalized. Then he remembered and mumbled, "That would 
be bad manners. Go on, eat." 

Baley ate industriously, but 
without enjoyment. He flicked an 
occasional glance at R. Daneel. 
The robot ate with precise motions of his jaws. Too precise. 
It didn't look quite natural. 

Strange, now that Baley knew 
R. Daneel was actually a robot, 
all sorts of little disparities 
showed up clearly, such as no 
movement of an Adam's apple 
when R. Daneel swallowed. Yet 
Baley didn't mind so much. Was 
he getting used to the creature? 
Suppose people started afresh on 
a new world — how that ran 
through his mind ever since Dr. 
Fastolfe had put it there — suppose Bentley, for instance, were 
to leave Earth, could he get so 
he wouldn't mind working and 
living alongside robots? . 

R. Daneel said, "Elijah, is it 
bad manners to watch another 
man while he is eating?" 



"If you mean stare directly 
at him, well, sure. That's only 
common sense, isn't it? A man 
has a right to his privacy. Ordinary conversation is all right, 
but you don't gape at a man 
while he's chewing." 

"I see. Why is it, then, that I 
count eight people watching us 
very closely?" 

Baley put down his fork. He 
looked about as though he were 
searching for the salt-pinch dispenser. 

"I see nothing at all out of the 
ordinary." 

But he said it without conviction. The mob of diners was only 
a vast conglomeration of strangers to him. And when R. Daneel 
turned his impersonal brown eyes 
upon him, Baley suspected uncomfortably that those were not 
eyes he saw, but photographic 
scanners. 

"I am quite certain," said R. 
Daneel calmly. 

"Well, what of it? It's crude 
behavior, but what does it 
prove?" 

"I cannot say, Elijah. Is it 
coincidence that six of the watchers were in the crowd outside 
the shoe store last night?" 

CHAPTER XI 

LIJE Baley's grip tightened on 
his fork. 
"Are you sure?" he demanded, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



129 



and immediately realized the uselessness of the question. You 
don't ask a computer if it is 
sure of the answer it disgorges; 
not even a computer with arms 
and legs and face. "Are they 
close to us?" 

"Not very. They are scattered." 

Baley returned to his meal, his 
fork moving mechanically. Behind the frown on his long face, 
his mind worked furiously. 

Suppose the incident last night 
had been organized by a group 
of anti-robot fanatics — men who 
had studied robots with the intensity born of deep hostility. 
One of them might have recognized R. Daneel for what he was. 
(The Commissioner had suggested that, in a way. Damn it, 
there were surprising depths to 
that man.) 

Even if they had been unable 
to act in an organized manner 
at the spur of the moment, they 
would still have been able to plan 
for the future. If they could 
recognize a robot such as R. 
Daneel, they could certainly 
realize that Baley himself was a 
police officer. A police officer in 
the unusual company of a humanoid robot would very likely 
be a responsible man in the organization. 

It followed then that observers 
at City Hall (or perhaps agents 
within City Hall) would be 
bound to spot Baley, R. Daneel, 



or both before too long a time 
had passed. That they had within 
twenty-four hours was not surprising, They might have done 
so in less time if Baley's day 
had not been spent mainly in 
Spacetown and along the Motorway. 

R. Daneel had finished his 
meal. He sat quietly waiting, his 
perfect hands resting lightly on 
the end of the table. 

"Had we not better do something?" he asked. 

"We're safe here in the kitchen," said Baley, "Now leave this 
to me. Please." 

Baley looked about him cautiously and it was as though he 
saw a kitchen for the first time. 

What was the capacity of an 
average kitchen? About 2200. 
This one was larger than average. 

Suppose the cry "Robot ! " 
were tossed among the thousands 
like a — 

He was at a loss for a comparison, 

A SPONTANEOUS riot could 
flare anywhere; in the kitchens as easily as in the corridors 
or in the elevators. More easily, 
perhaps. There was a lack of inhibition at mealtimes, a sense of 
horseplay that could degenerate 
into something more serious at a 
trifle. 

But a planned riot would be 




 



different. Here in the kitchen, 
the agitators would themselves 
be caught in a mob-filled room. 
Hundreds would certainly die 
and they themselves might easily 
be among them. 

No, a safe riot would have to 
be planned in the avenues of the 
City, in some relatively narrow 
passageway. There would be 
time for the quick, prepared fadeaway along the side passage or 
the unobtrusive step onto an 
escalating Localway that would 
move them to a higher level and 
disappearance. 

Baley felt trapped. There were 
probably others waiting outside. 
Baley and R. Daneel were to be 
followed to a proper point and 
the fuse would be set off. 

R. Daneel said, "Why not arrest them?" 

"That would only start the 
trouble sooner. You know their 
faces, don't you?" 

"I am not capable of forgetting." 

"Then we'll nab them another 
time. Follow me. Do exactly as 
I do." 

He rose, turned his dish carefully upside down, centering it 
on the movable disc on which it 
had risen. He put his fork back 
in its recess. R. Daneel, watching, 
did the same. The dishes and 
utensils dropped out of sight. 

R. Daneel said, "They are getting up, too." 



"They won't get too close. Not 
here." 

TJALEY looked through the, 
" steamy haze and the noise 
and with incongruous sharpness 
thought of a visit to the City Zoo 
with Ben six or seven years ago. 
It had been the boy's first visit 
and he had been excited. After 
all, he had never actually seen 
a cat or a dog or a bird before. 
Even Baley himself, who had seen 
it a dozen times before, was not 
immune to its fascination. 

It was feeding time in the 
sparrow cage and an attendant 
was dumping cracked oats into 
a long trough. Human beings had 
grown used to yeast substitutes, 
but animals, more conservative 
in their way, insisted on real 
grain. 

The sparrows flocked down in 
what seemed like hundreds. 
Wing to wing, with an earsplitting twitter, they lined the 
trough — 

That was it, the picture that 
came to Baley's mind as he looked back at the kitchen he was 
leaving. Sparrows at the trough. 
The thought repelled him. 

He thought: Jehoshaphat, there 
must be a better way. 

But what better way? What 
was wrong with this way? It 
had never bothered him before. 

He said abruptly to R. Daneel, 
"Ready, Daneel?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



131 



"I am ready, Elijah." 

They left the kitchen and 
escape was now flatly up to 
Baley. 

THERE is a game that youngsters know called "running 
the strips." Its rules vary from 
City to City, but the essentials 
are eternal. Its object is to get 
from point A to point B via the 
City's rapid transit system in 
such a way that the "leader" 
manages to lose as many of his 
followers as possible. A leader 
who arrives at the destination 
alone is skillful indeed, as is a 
follower who refuses to be shaken. 

The game is usually conducted during the evening rush-hour 
when the increased flow of commuters makes it more hazardous 
and complicated. The leader sets 
off, running up and down the 
accelerating strips. He does his 
best to do the unexpected, standing on a strip as long as possible, 
then leaping off suddenly in either 
direction. He will run quickly 
through several strips, then remain waiting once more. 

Pity the follower who incautiously careens forward one strip 
too far. Before he has caught his 
mistake, unless he is extraordinarily nimble, he has driven 
past the leader or fallen behind. 

To increase the complexity of 
the task tenfold, a leader will 
board the Locatways or the Ex


pressways themselves, and hurtle 
off the other side. It is bad form 
to avoid them completely and 
also bad form to linger on them. 

The attraction of the game is 
not easy for an adult to understand, particularly for an adult 
who has never himself been a 
teen-age strip-runner. The players are roughly treated by legitimate travelers into whose path 
they find themselves inevitably 
flying. They are persecuted by 
the police and punished by their 
parents, denounced in the schools 
and on the sub-etherics. No year 
passed without its four or five 
teen-agers killed at the game; its 
dozens hurt; its cases of injured 
innocent bystanders. 

Yet nothing could be done to 
wipe out the strip-running gangs. 
The greater the danger, the more 
the strip-runners had that most 
valuable of all prizes, honor in 
the eyes of their fellows. A successful one might well swagger; 
a well-known leader was cockof-the-walk. 

Elijah Baley, for instance, remembered with satisfaction even 
now that he had been a striprunner once. He had led a gang 
of twenty from the Concourse 
Sector to the borders of Queens, 
crossing three Expressways. In 
two tireless and relentless hours, 
he had shaken off some of the 
most agile followers of the Bronx, 
and arrived at the destination 



in 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



point alone. They had talked 
about that run for months. 

Baley hadn't run the strips for 
over twenty years, but he remembered some of the tricks. What 
he had lost in agility, he made 
up in the fact that he was a 
policeman. No one but another 
policeman as experienced as himself could possibly know where 
almost every metal-bordered alley began and ended. 

TTE walked away from the 
kitchen briskly, but not too 
rapidly. Each moment he expected the cry of "Robot! Robot!" 
to ring out behind him. He counted the steps until he felt the fifst 
accelerating strip moving under 
him. 

He stopped- for a moment, 
while R. Daneel moved smoothly 
up beside him. 

"Are they still behind us, 
Daneel?" 

"Yes. They are moving closer." 

"That won't last," said Baley 
confidently. He looked at the 
strips stretching to either side, 
with their human cargo whipping 
to his left more and more rapidly as their distance from him increased. He had felt the strips 
beneath his feet many times a 
day almost all the days of his 
life, but he had not bent his 
knees in anticipation of running 
them in seven thousand days and 
more. He felt the old familiar 



thrill and his breath grew more 
rapid. 

He forgot the one time he had 
caught Ben at the game. He had 
lectured him interminably and 
threatened to have him* put under police surveillance. 

Lightly, quickly, at double the 
"safe" rate, he went up the 
strips. He leaned forward sharply against the acceleration. The 
Local way was humming past. 
For a moment, it looked as 
though he would mount, but suddenly he was fading backward, 
backward, dodging through the 
crowd to left and right as it thickened on the slower strips. 

He stopped and let himself be 
carried along at a mere fifteen 
miles an hour. 

"How many are with us, Daneel?" 

"Only one, Elijah." The robot 
was at his side, unruffled, unbreathing. 

"He must have been a good 
one in his day, too, but he won't 
last either." 

He looked about quickly. 
Where were they now? B-22nd 
Street flashed by. 

He judged his steps carefully. 
Up the strips, smoothly and 
steadily, a swing onto the Localway platform and a quick wriggle to the other side. 

Off he went and down the decelerating strips in a complicated 
pattern so that his feet met the 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



133 



V-joint strips of an Expressway 
at the exact point of cross-over. 
Without loss of rhythm, he was 
accelerating again, then up and 
over an Expressway. 

"Is he with us, Daneel?" 

"Not one in sight, Elijah." 

"Good. What a strip-runner 
you would have been, Daneel!" 

Off onto another Localway in 
a whirl and down the strips with 
a clatter to a doorway, large and 
official in appearance. A guard 
rose to his feet. 

Baley flashed his identification. 
"Official business." 

They were inside. 

"Power plant," said Baley 
curtly. "This covers our tracks 
completely." 

¥>ALEY had been in power 
plants before, including this 
one. Familiarity did not lessen 
his feeling of uncomfortable awe. 
His father had held an important 
job in such a - plant — before a 
robot specialist replaced him. 

There was the surrounding 
hum of the tremendous generators hidden in the central well of 
the plant; the faint sharpness of 
ozone in the air, the grim and silent threat of the red lines that 
marked the limits beyond which 
no one could pass without protective clothing. 

Somewhere in the plant — Baley 
had no idea just where — a pound 
of fissionable material was con



 



sumed each day. Every so often, 
the radioactive fission products, 
the so-called "hot ash" was 
forced by air pressure through 
leaden pipes to distant caverns 
ten miles out in the ocean and a 
half-mile below the ocean floor. 
Baley sometimes wondered what 
would happen when the caverns 
were filled. 

He said to R. Daneel with sudden gruffness, "Stay away from 
the red lines." Then he added 
sheepishly, "But I suppose it 
doesn't matter to you." 

"Is it a question of radioactivity?" asked Daneel. 

"Yes." 

"Then it does matter to me. 
Gamma radiation destroys the 
delicate balance of a positronic 
brain. It would affect me much 
sooner than it would affect you." 

"You mean it would kill you?" 

"I would require a new positronic brain. Since no two can 
be alike, I would be a new individual. The Daneel you now 
speak to would, in a manner of 
speaking, be dead." 

Baley looked at the other 
doubtfully. "I never knew that. 
Up these ramps." 

"The point isn't stressed. 
Spacetown wishes to convince 
Earthmen of the usefulness of 
such as myself, not of our weaknesses." 

"Then why tell me?" 

R. Daneel turned his eyes full 



on his human companion. "You 
are my partner, Elijah. It is well 
that you know my weaknesses 
and Shortcomings." 

Baley cleared his throat and 
had nothing more to add to the 
subject. 

"Out in this direction," he said 
a moment later, "and we're a 
quarter of a mile from our apartment." 

IT was a grim lower-class flat. 
One small room and two beds. 
Two fold-in chairs and a closet. 
A built-in sub-etheric screen that 
allowed no manual adjustment, 
and would be working only at 
stated hours, but would be working then. No wash-basin and no 
facilities for cooking or even boiling water. A small trash-disposal 
pipe was in one corner of the 
room, an ugly, unadorned, unpleasantly functional object. 

Baley shrugged. "I guess we 
can stand it." 

R. Daneel walked to the trashdisposal pipe. His shirt unseamed 
at a touch, revealing a smooth 
and, to all appearances, wellmuscled chest. 

"What are you doing?" asked 
Baley. 

"Getting rid of the food I ingested. If I were to leave it, it 
would spoil and I would attract 
displeasure." 

R. Daneel placed two fingers 
carefully under one nipple and

his chest opened longitudinally. 
He reached in and from a welter 
of gleaming metal withdrew a 
translucent sac, partly distended. 
He opened it while Baley watched with a kind of horror. 

R. Daneel hesitated. He said, 
"The food is completely unchanged. I do not salivate or 
digest. It was drawn in through 
the gullet by suction, you know. 
It is as edible as if it were put 
through any other kind of machine." 

"Thafs all right," said Baley 
gently. "You just get rid of it." 

R. Daneel's food sac was of 
fluorocarbon plastic, Baley decided. At least the food did not 
cling to it. It came out smoothly 
and was placed little by little 
into the pipe. A waste of good 
food at that, he thought. 

He sat down on one bed and 
removed his shirt. He said, "I 
suggest an early start tomorrow." 

"For a specific reason?" 

"The location of this apartment isn't known to our friends 
yet. At least, I hope not. If we 
leave early, we are that much 
safer. Once in City Hall, we will 
have to decide whether our partnership is still practical." 

"You think perhaps it is not?" 

Baley shrugged and said dourly, "We can't go through this sort 
of thing every day." 

"But it seems to me — " 

R. Daneel was interrupted by 



the sharp scarlet sliver of the 
door signal. 

BALEY rose silently to his feet 
and unlimbered his blaster. 
The door signal flashed once 
mort. 

He moved silently to the door, 
put his thumb on the blaster 
contact and threw the switch 
that activated the one-way transparency patch. It was small and 
had a distorting effect, but it was 
good enough to show Baley's 
youngster, Ben, outside the door. 

Baley flung the door open, 
snatched brutally at Ben's wrist 
as the boy raised his hand to 
signal a third time and pulled 
him in. 

The look of fright and bewilderment faded only slowly from 
Ben's eyes as he leaned breathlessly against the wall toward 
which he had been hurled. He 
rubbed his wrist. 

"Dad!" he said. "You didn't 
have to grab me like that." 

Baley was staring through the 
view-patch of the closed door. 
As nearly as he could tell, the 
corridor was empty. 

"Did you see anyone out there, 
Ben?" 

"No. Gee, dad, I just came to 
see if you were all right." 

"Why shouldn't I be all right?" 

"I don't know. It was Mom. 
She was crying and all like that. 
She said I had to find you. If I 




 



didn't she said she would go herself and then she didn't know 
what would happen. She made 
me go, Dad." 

Baley said, "How did you find 
me? Did your - mother know 
where I was?" 

"No, she didn't. I called up 
your office." 

"And they told you?" 

Ben looked startled at his 
father's vehemence. 

"Sure. Weren't they supposed 
to?" 

Baley and Daneel looked at 
one another. 

Baley rose heavily to his feet. 
"Where's your mother now, Ben? 
At the apartment?" 

"No, we went to Grandma's for 
dinner and stayed there. I'm 
supposed to go back there now. 
I mean as long as you're all right, 
Dad." 

"You'll stay here. Daneel, did 
you notice the exact location of 
the floor Communo?" 

The robot said, "Yes. Do you 
intend leaving the room to use 
it?" 

"I've got to. I have to get in 
touch with Jessie." 

"Might I suggest that it would 
be more logical to let Bentley 
do that? It is a form of risk and 
he is less valuable." 

Baley stared: "Why, you — " 
He thought: Jehoshaphat, what 
am I getting angry about? He 
went on more calmly, "You don't 



understand, Daneel. Among us, 
it is not customary for a man to 
send his young son into possible 
danger, even if it is logical to do 
so." 

"Danger!" squeaked Ben in a 
sort of horrified pleasure. "What's 
going on, Dad? Huh, Dad?" 

'This isn't any of your business, understand? I want you in 
bed when I get back. You hear 
me?" 

"Aw, gosh. You could tell a 
fellow. I won't say anything." 
"In bed!" 
"Aw, yeast!" 

HITCHING his jacket back, 
Baley stood at the floor 
Cummuno, his blaster butt ready 
for snatching. He spoke his personal number into the mouthpiece 
and waited while a computer fifteen miles away checked it to 
make sure the call was permissible. It was a very short wait, 
since a plainsclothesman had no 
limit on the number of his business calls. He spoke the code 
number of his mother-in-law's 
apartment. 

The small screen at the base 
of the instrument lit up and her 
face looked out at him. 

He said in a low voice, "Mother, put Jessie on." 

Jessie must have been waiting 
for him. She appeared at once. 
Baley looked at her face and then 
darkened the screen deliberately. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



"All right, Jessie. Ben's here. 
Now what's the matter?" His 
eyes roved from side to side continuously, watching. 

"Are you all right? You aren't 
in trouble?" 

. "I'm obviously all right, Jessie. 
Now stop it." 

"Oh, Lije, I've been so worried." 

"What about?" 

"You know. Your friend." 

"There'll be no trouble. I'm 
keeping Ben with me tonight and 
you go to bed. Good-by, dear." 

He broke the connection and 
waited for two breaths before 
starting back. His face was gray 
with apprehension and fear. 

Ben was standing in the middle 
of the room when Baley returned. 
One of his contact lenses was 
neatly pocketed in a little suction cup. The other was still in 
his eye. 

Ben said, "Gosh, Dad, isn't 
there any water in the place? 
Mr. Olivaw says I can't go to 
the Personal." 

"You can't. Put that thing 
back in your eye, Ben. It won't 
hurt you to sleep with them for 
one night." 

"All right." Ben obeyed and 
climbed into bed. "Boy, what a 
mattress V 

Baley said to R. Daneel, "I 
suppose you won't mind sitting 
up." 

"Of course not. I was interest


ed, by the way, in the queer glass 
Bentley wears close to his eyes. 
Do all Earthmen wear them?" 

"Just some," said Baley absently. "I don't, for instance." 

"For what reason is it worn?" 

Baley was too absorbed with 
his own thoughts to answer. His 
own uneasy thoughts. 

The lights were out, but Baley 
remained wakeful. He was dimly 
aware of Ben's breathing as it 
grew deep and regular. When he 
turned his head, he became conscious of R. Daneel, sitting in a 
chair with grave immobility, facing the door. 

Then he fell asleep. 

He dreamed Jessie was falling 
into the fission chamber of a 
nuclear power plant. She held out 
her arms to him, shrieking, but 
he could only stand frozenly just 
outside a scarlet line and watch 
her distorted figure as it fell, 
growing smaller until it was only 
a dot. 

He could only watch her in 
the dream, knowing that it was 
he himself who had pushed her. 

CHAPTER XII 

T^LIJAH BALEY looked up as 
-"-^ Commissioner Julius Enderby entered the office. He nodded 
wearily. 

The Commissioner looked at 
the clock. "Don't tell me you've 
been here all night." 



138 




 



"I won't," Baley said. 

The Commissioner asked in a 
low voice, "Any trouble last 
night?*' 

"No." 

"I've been thinking that I 
might be minimizing the danger 
of riots. If there's anything to — " 

"For God's sake, Commissioner, if anything happened, I'd tell 
you. There was no trouble of any 
sort." 

"AH right." The Commissioner 
moved away, closing the door 
that marked off the unusual privacy that went with his exalted 
position. 

Baley looked after him and 
thought: He slept last night. 

Baley hadn't. He bent to the 
routine report he was trying to 
write as a cover-up for the real 
activities of the last two days, 
but the words he had tapped out 
by finger-touch blurred and 
danced. Slowly, he became aware 
of an object standing by his desk. 

It was R. Sammy. Baley 
thought: Julius's private mechanical flunky. It pays to be a 
Commissioner. 

R., Sammy said through his 
fatuous grin, "The Commissioner 
wants to see you, Lije." 

"He just saw me. Tell him I'll 
be in later." 

"He says right now." 

"I heard you. Go away." 

The robot backed away, saying, "The Commissioner wants 



to see you right now, Lije. He 
says right now." 

"Jehoshaphat," said Baley angrily. "I'm going. I'm going." He 
got up from his desk, headed for 
the office and R. Sammy was 
silent. 

Baley said as he entered, 
"Damn it, Commissioner, don't 
send that thing after me, will 
you?" 

The Commissioner was tapping the paper before him. 
"There's a record of a call you 
made to a Dr, Gerrigel at Washington by insulated beam." 

"That's right." 

"There's no record of the conversation, naturally, since it was 
insulated. What's it all about?" 

"I'm after background information." 

"He's a roboticist, isn't he?" . 

"Yes." 

"What's the point? What kind 
of information are you after?" 

"I'm not sure, Commissioner. 
I just have a feeling that in a 
case like this, information on 
robots might help." 

"I wouldn't, Lije. I don't think 
it's wise." 

"What's your objection?" 

"The fewer the people ivho 
know about all this, the better." 

"I'll tell him as little as I can." 

"I still don't think it's wise." 

"Are you ordering me not to 
see him, Commissioner?" 

"No, no! Do as you see fit. 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



You're heading this investigation. 
Only—" 

"Only what?" 

The Commissioner shook his 
head. "Nothing. Where is he? 
You know who I mean." 

"Daneel's still at the files." 

The Commissioner paused a 
long moment. "We're not making 
much progress, you know." 

"We're not making any. That's 
why I'm calling in Dr. Gerrigel." 

"All right," said the Commissioner, but he didn't look as 
though he really thought it was 
all right. 

RDANEEL was at Baley's 
• desk when the plainclothesman returned. 

"Well, and what have you 
got?" Baley asked gruffly. 

"I have completed my first 
rather hasty search through the 
files, partner Elijah. I believe I 
have located two people whose 
descriptions tally with two of 
those who tried to track us last 
night and who. moreover, were 
at the shoe store during the former incident." 
"Let's see." 

R. Daneel placed the stampsize cards before Baley. They 
were mottled with the small dots 
that served as code. The robot 
also produced a portable decoder 
and put one of the cards into a 
slot. The dots possessed electrical 
conduction properties different 



from that of the card as a whole. 
The electric field passing through , 
the card was therefore distorted | 
and, in response, the three-by- j 
six screen above the decoder was j 
filled with words. Words which, i 
uncoded, would have filled sev- J 
eral sheets of standard report- j 
paper. Words, furthermore, which '• 
could not possibly be interpreted 
without an official police decoder. 

Baley read through the material stolidly. The first person was 
Francis Clousarr, age 33 at time 
of arrest two years before; cause 
of arrest, inciting to riot; employee at New York Yeast; home , 
address; parentage; hair, eyes, i 
distinguishing marks, educational | 
history, employment history, psy- j 
choanalytic profile, physical pro-| 
file, reference to tri-photo in the 
rogues' gallery. 

"You checked the photo- i 
graph?" asked Baley. j 

"Yes. Elijah." R. Daneel spoke} 
patiently. i 

The second person was Ger- f 
hard Paul. Baley glanced at the 
material on that card and said, 
"This is all no good." 

"I am sure that cannot be so. 
If there is an organization of 
Earthmen capable of the crime 
we are investigating, these are 
members. Should they not be 
questioned?" 

"We'd get nothing out of 
them." 

"They were there, both at the 



140 




 



shoe store and in the kitchen. 
They cannot deny it." 

"Just being there's no crime. 
Besides which, they can say they 
weren't there. How can we prove 
they're lying?" 

"I saw them." 

"That's no proof," said Baley 
savagely. "No court, if it ever 
came to that, would believe that 
you could remember two faces in 
a blur of a million." 

"It is obvious that / can." 

"Sure. Tell them what you are. 
As soon as you do that, you're 
no witness. Your kind have no 
status in any court of law on 
Earth." 

R. Daneel said, "I take it, 
then, that you have changed your 
mind." 

"What do you mean?" Baley 
scowled at him. 

"Yesterday, in the kitchen, you 
said there was no need to arrest 
them. You said that as long as I 
remembered their faces, we could 
arrest them at any time." 

"Well, I didn't think it through. 
It can't be done." 

"Not even for psychological 
reasons? They would not know 
we had no legal proof of their 
complicity in conspiracy." 

Baley said tensely; "Look, I am 
expecting Dr. Gerrigel of Washington in half an hour. Do you 
mind waiting till he's been here 
and gone? Do you mind?" 

"I will wait," said R. Daneel. 



ANTHONY GERRIGEL was 
a precise and very polite 
man of middle height, who looked far from being one of the most 
erudite roboticists on Earth. He 
was nearly twenty minutes late 
and quite apologetic about it. 
Baley, white with an anger born 
of apprehension, shrugged off the 
apologies gracelessly. He checked 
his reservation on Conference 
Room D, repeated his instructions that they were not to be 
disturbed for an hour and led Dr. 
Gerrigel and R. Daneel down the 
corridor, up a ramp, and through 
a. door that led to one of the 
spy-beam-insulated chambers. 

Before sitting down, Baley listened to the soft burr of the 
pulsometer in his hand, waiting 
for any fading of the steady 
sound which would indicate a 
break, even a small one, in the 
insulation. He turned it on the 
ceiling, floor, and, with particular care, on the door. There was 
no break. 

Dr. Gerrigel smiled a little. He 
looked like a man who never 
smiled more than a little. He was 
dressed with a neatness that could 
only be described as fussy. His 
iron-gray hair was smoothed 
carefully back and his face looked pink and freshly washed. He 
sat with prim stiffness. 

He said to Baley, "You make 
this seem very formidable." 
"It's important, Doctor. Any


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



141 



thing we say here, of course, is 
top secret and the City will expect you to forget it all when you 
leave." Baley looked at his 
watch. 

The little smile on the roboti. cist's face winked away. "Let me 
explain why I am late." The matter obviously weighed upon him. 
"I decided not to go by air. I get 
airsick." 

, "That's too bad," said Baley. 
He put away the pulsometer, 
after checking its standard settings to make last-minute certain 
that there was nothing wrong 
with it, and sat down. 

"Not exactly airsick, but nervous. A mild agoraphobia. It's 
nothing particularly abnormal, 
but it's there. So I took the Expressways." 

Baley felt a sudden sharp interest. "Agoraphobia?" 

"I make it sound worse than 
it is," the roboticist said at once. 
"It's just the sensation you get 
in a plane. Have you ever been 
in one, Mr. Baley?" 

"Several times." 

"Then you must know what I 
mean. It's that feeling of being 
surrounded by nothing; of being 
separated from — from empty air 
by a mere inch of metal. It's very 
uncomfortable." 

"So you took the Expressway." 

"Yes." 

"All the way from Washington 
to New York?" 

142 



"Oh, I've done it before. Since 
they built the Baltimore-Philadelphia tunnel, it's quite simple." 

SO it was. Baley had never 
made the trip himself, but he 
was aware that it was possible. 
Washington, Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York had 
grown, in the last two centuries, 
to the point where all nearly 
touched. The Four City Area was 
almost the official name for the 
entire stretch of coast and there 
were a considerable number of 
people who favored administrative consolidation and the formation of a single super-City, 
Baley disagreed. New York City, 
by itself was almost too large to J 
be handled by a centralized gov- ' 
ernment. A larger City with over 
fifty million population would 
break down under its own weight. 

"The trouble was," Dr. Gerrigel was saying, "that I missed a 
connection in Chester Sector, 1 
Philadelphia, and lost time. That : 
and a little difficulty in getting a 
transient room assignment ended 3 
by making me late." 

"Don't worry about it, doctor. 
What you say, though, is interesting. In view of your dislike 
for planes, how would you feel 
about going outside City limits 
on foot?" 

"For what reason?" He looked 
startled. 

"I'm not suggesting that you 

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



really should. I want to know 
how the notion strikes you, that's 
all." 

"It strikes me very unpleasantly." 

"Suppose you had to leave the 
City at night and walk crosscountry for half a mile or more." 

"I — I don't think I could be 
persuaded to." 

"No matter how important the 
necessity?" 

"If it were to save my life or 
those of my family, I might try 
it." He looked embarrassed. 
"May I ask the point of these 
questions, Mr. Baley?" 

"I'll tell you. A serious crime 
has been committed, a particularly disturbing murder. I'm not at 
liberty to give you the details. 
There is a theory, however, that 
the murderer, in order to commit 
the crime, did just what we were 
discussing — he crossed open 
country at night and alone. I was 
just wondering what kind of man 
could do that." 

Dr. Gerrigel shuddered. "No 
one I know. Certainly not I. Of 
course, among millions, I suppose 
you could find a few such individuals." 

"But you wouldn't say it was 
a very likely thing for a human 
being to do." 

"No. Not at all likely." 

"In fact, if there's any other 
explanation for the crime, any 
other conceiVab/e explanation, it 



should definitely be considered." 

Dr. Gerrigel looked more uncomfortable than ever as he sat 
upright with his well-kept hands 
precisely folded in his lap. "Do 
you have an alternate explanation in mind?" 

"Yes. It occurs to me that a 
robot, for instance, would have 
no difficulty at all in crossing 
open country." 

T\R. GERRIGEL stood up. 
" "Oh, my dear sir!" 

"What's wrong?" asked Baley. 

"You mean a robot may have 
committed the crime?" 

"Why not?" 

"Murder? Of a human being?" 

"Yes. Please sit down, Doctor." 

"Mr. Baley, there are two acts 
involved: walking cross-country 
and murder. A human being 
could commit the murder, but 
would find difficulty in crossing 
open country. A robot could cross 
open country easily, but the murder would be completely impossible. If you're going to replace 
an unlikely theory by t an impossible one — " 

"Impossible is a strong word." 

"You've heard of the First Law 
of Robotics, Mr. Baley?" 

"Sure. I can even quote it: A 
robot may not injure a human 
being, or, through inaction, allow 
a human being to come to harm." 
Baley suddenly pointed a finger 
at the roboticist- "Why can't a 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



143 



robot be built without the First 
Law? What's so sacred about it?" 

"If you even know a little 
about robotics, you must know 
the gigantic task involved, both 
mathematically and electronically, in building a positronic brain." 

"I have an idea," said Baley. 
He remembered well his visit to a 
robot factory once in line of duty. 
He had seen the library of bookfilms; long ones, each of which 
contained the mathematical analysis of a single type of positronic brain. It took more than 
an hour for the average film to be 
viewed at standard scanning 
speed, condensed though its 
symbolisms were. And no two 
brains were alike even when prepared according to the most rigid 
specifications. That, Baley understood, was a consequence of 
Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle. This meant that each film 
had to be supplemented by appendices involving possible variations. 

It was a job, all right. Baley 
wouldn't deny that. 

Dr. Gerrigel said, "Well, then, 
you must understand that a design for a new type of positronic 
brain, even one where only minor 
innovations are involved, is not 
the matter of a night's work. It 
usually requires the entire research staff of a factory and takes 
anywhere up to a year. Even this 
would not be enough if it were 

144 i 



not that the basic theory of such 
circuits has already been standardized. The basic theory involves the Three Laws of Robotics: the First Law, which you've 
quoted; the Second Law, which 
states 'A robot must obey the 
orders given it by human beings 
except where such orders would 
conflict with the First Law,' and 
the Third Law, which states 'A 
robot must protect its own existence as long as such protection 
does not conflict with the First or 
Second Law.' Do you understand?" 

RDANEEL, who, to all ap• pearances, had been following the conversation with close 
attention, broke in. "If you will 
excuse me, Elijah, I would like 
to see if I follow Dr. Gerrigel. 
What you imply, sir, is that any 
attempt to build a robot, the 
workings of whose positronic 
brain is not oriented about the 
Three Laws, would require first 
the setting up of a new basic 
theory and that this, in turn, 
would take many years." 

The roboticist looked gratified. "That is exactly what I 
mean, Mr. — " 

Baley said, "This is Daneel 
Olivaw, Dr. Gerrigel." 
"Good day, Mr. Olivaw." Dr. 
i Gerrigel shook Daneel's hand. He 
t went on, "It is my estimation that 
it would take fifty years to de

 



velop the basic theory of a nonAsenion positronic brain — that 
is, one in which the basic assumptions of the Three Laws are disallowed — and bring it to the 
point where robots similar to 
modern models could be constructed." 

"And this has never been 
done?" asked Baley. "We've been 
building robots for thousands of 
yeafs. In all that time, hasn't 
anybody or any group had fifty 
years to spare?" 

"Certainly," said the roboticist, "but it is not the sort of 
work a roboticist would care to 
do." 

"I find that hard to believe. 
Human curiosity will undertake 
anything." 

"It hasn't undertaken the nonAsenion robot. The human race, 
Mr. Baley, has a strong Frankenstein complex." 

"A what?" 

"That's a popular name derived from a Medieval novel describing a robot that turned 
against its creator. I never read 
the novel myself. However, that's 
beside the point. What I wish to 
say is that robots without the 
First Law are simply not built." 

"And no theory for it even exists?" 

"Not to my knowledge, and 
my knowledge^" he smiled selfconsciously — "is rather extensive." 



"And a robot with a First Law 
built in could not kill a man." 

"Never. Unless the killings 
were completely accidental or 
unless it were necessary to save 
the lives of two or more men. In 
either case, the positronic conflict 
would ruin the brain beyond recovery." 

"All this represents the situation on Earth. Right?" 

"Yes. Certainly." 

"What about the Outer 
Worlds?" Baley demanded. 

SOME ofs Dr. Gerrigel's selfassurance seemed to ooze 
away. "Oh, dear, Mr. Baley, I 
couldn't say of my own knowledge, but I'm sure that if nonAsenion positronic brains were 
ever designed or if the mathematical theory were worked out, 
we'd hear of it." 

"Would we? Well, let me follow up another thought in my 
mind, Dr. Gerrigel. I hope you 
don't mind." 

"No. Not at all." He looked 
helplessly first at Baley, then at 
R. Daneel. "After all, if it is as 
important as you say, I'm glad 
to do all I can." 

"Thank you, Doctor. My question is, why humanoid robots? 
I've been taking them for granted 
all my life, but it occurs to me 
that I don't know the reason for 
their existence. Why should a 
robot look like a man?" 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



145 



Dr. Gerrigel smiled a little. 
"The early literature of robotics 
is riddled with heated arguments 
over that very matter. If you 
would like a very good reference 
to the polemics among the functionalists and antifunctionalists, 
I can recommend Hanford's History of Robotics. Mathematics is 
kept to a minimum. I think you'd 
find it very interesting." 

"I'll look it up," said Baley 
patiently. "Meanwhile, could you 
give me an idea?" 

"The decision was made on the 
basis of economics. Look here, 
Mr. Baley, if you were supervising a farm, would you care to 
buy a tractor, a reaper, a harrow, 
a milker, an automobile, and so 
on, each with a positronic brain; 
or would you rather have ordinary un-brained machinery with 
a single positronic robot to run 
them all? The second alternative, 
incidentally, represents only a 
fiftieth or a hundredth the expense." 

"But why the human form?" 
Baley persisted. 

**Because it is the most successful generalized form in all nature. 
We are not a specialized animal, 
Mr. Baley, except for our nervous systems and a few odd 
items. If you want a design capable of doing a great many different things, you could do no 
better than to imitate the human 
form. Besides that, our entire 



technology is based on the human form. An automobile, for 
instance, has controls meant to 
be manipulated by human kands 
and feet of a certain average size 
and shape, attached to the body 
by limbs of a certain average 
length and joints of a certain 
type. Even simple objects like 
chairs and tables or knives and 
forks are designed to meet such 
requirements. It is easier to have 
robots imitate the human shape 
than to redesign radically so 
much of our civilization." 

"That makes sense. Now isn't 
it true, Doctor, that the roboticists of the Outer World manufacture robots that are much 
more humanoid than our own?" 

"I believe so." 

"Could they manufacture a robot so humanoid that it would 
pass as human under ordinary 
conditions?" 

T\R. GERRIGEL lifted his 
eyebrows and considered 
that. "It would be terribly expensive. I doubt that the return 
could be profitable enough to 
make the attempt worth the effort." 

"Do you suppose," went on 
Baley remorselessly, "that they 
could make a robot that would 
fool you into thinking it was human?" 

The roboticist tittered. "Oh, 
my dear Mr. Baley. I doubt that. 



GA1AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Really. There's more to a robot 
than just his appear — " 

Dr. Gerrigel froze in the middle of the word. Slowly, he turned to R. Daneel, and his pink 
face went very pale. 

"Dear me!" he whispered. "Oh, 
dear me!" 

He reached out one hand and 
touched R. Daneel's cheek gingerly. R. Daneel did not move 
away, but gazed at the roboticist 
calmly, 

"Dear me," said Dr. Gerrigel, 
with what was almost a sob in his 
voice, "you are a robot." 

"It took you a long time to 
realize that," said Baley drily. 

"I wasn't expecting it. I never 
saw one like this. Outer World 
manufacture?" 

"Yes." 

"It's obvious now. The way he 
holds himself. The manner of his 
speaking. It is not a perfect imitation, Mr. Baley." 

"It's pretty good, though, isn't 
it?" 

"Oh, it's marvelous. I doubt 
that anyone could recognize the 
imposture at sight. I am very 
grateful to you for having me 
brought face to face with him. 
May I examine him?" The roboticist was on his feet, eager, 

Baley put out c hand. "Please, 
Doctor. In a moment. First, the 
matter of the murder, you know." 

"Is that real, then?" Dr, Gerrigel was bitterly disappointed and 



showed it. "I thought perhaps 
that was just a trick to keep my 
mind engaged and to see how 
long I could be fooled by — " 

"It is not a trick, Dr. Gerrigel. 
Tell me now, in constructing a 
robot as humanoid as this one, 
with the deliberate purpose of 
having it pass as human, is it not 
necessary to make its brain possess properties as close to those 
of the human brain as possible?" 

"Certainly." 

"Very well. Couldn't such a 
humanoid brain lack the First 
Law? Perhaps it is left out accidentally. You say the theory is 
unknown. The very fact that it 
is unknown means that the constructors might set up a brain 
without the First Law. They*" 
would not know what to avoid." 

GERRIGEL was shaking his* 
head vigorously. "Oh, no! 
Impossible! A robot without the 
First Law? It can't be done!" 

"Are you sure? We can test 
the Second Law, of course. Daneel, let me have your blaster." 

Baley's eyes never left the robot. His own fist, well to one side, 
gripped his own blaster tightly. 

R. Daneel said calmly, "Here 
it is, Elijah," and held it out, 
butt-first. 

Baley said, "A plainclothesman must never abandon his 
blaster. A robot has ho choice 
but to obey a human." 



THE CAVES OF STIfl 



147 



"Except, Mr. Baley," said Dr. 
Gerrigel, "when obedience involves breaking the First Law." 

"Do you know, Doctor, that 
Daneel drew his blaster on an 
unarmed group of men and women and threatened to shoot?" 

"But I did not shoot," R. Daneel stated. 

"Granted, but the threat was 
unusual in itself, wasn't it, Doctor?" 

Dr. Gerrigel bit his lip. "I'd 
need to know the exact circumstances to judge. It does sound 
unusual, I admit." 

"Consider this, then. R. Daneel 
was on the scene at the time of 
the murder, and if "you omit the 
possibility of an Earthman having moved across open country, 
carrying a weapon with him, 
only Daneel of all the persons on 
the scene could have hidden the 
weapon." 

"Hidden the weapon?" asked 
Dr. Gerrigel. "I don't follow 
you." 

"Let me explain. The scene of 
the murder was searched minutely and the blaster that did the 
killing was not found. Yet ,it 
could not have vanished like 
smoke. There is only one place 
it could have been; only one place 
they would not have thought to 
look." 

"Where, Elijah?" asked R. 
Daneel. 

Baley brought his blaster into 



view, held its barrel firmly in 
the robot's direction. 
"In your food sac, Daneel!" 

CHAPTER XIII 

THE roboticist, whose glance 
had been alternating wildly 
between the plainclothesman and 
the robot, let it come to rest upon 
the human being. 

"What is all this?" he bleated. 
"I've asked you here for an authoritative analysis of this robot," 
said Baley. "I can arrange to 
have you use the laboratories of 
the City Bureau of Standards. If 
you need any piece of equipment 
they don't have, I'll get it for 
you. What I want is a quick and 
definite answer, and hang the 
expense and trouble." 

Dr. Gerrigel tittered nervously 
and said, "My dear Mr. Baley, 
I won't need a laboratory." 

"Why not?" asked Baley apprehensively, muscles tense. 

"It's not difficult to test the 
First Law. I've never had to, but 
it's simple enough." 

Baley pulled air in through his 
mouth and let it out slowly. "Are 
you saying that you can test him 
here?" 

"Yes, of course. If I were a 
Doctor of Medicine and had to 
test a patient's blood sugar, 
measure his basal metabolic 
rate, his cortical function, or 
check his genes to pinpoint a 




 



congenital malfunction, I'd need 
elaborate equipment. On the 
other hand, I could learn if he 
was blind by merely passing my 
hand before his eyes and test 
whether he was dead by feeling 
for his pulse. 

"What I'm getting at is that 
the more important and fundamental the property being tested, 
the simpler the needed equipment. It's the same in a robot. 
The First Law is fundamental. 
It affects everything. If it were 
absent, the robot could not react 
properly in at least two dozen 
obvious ways." 

As he spoke, he took out a 

THE CAVES OF STEEl 



flat, black object which expanded 
into a small book-viewer. He inserted a well-worn spool into the 
receptacle. He then took out a 
stopwatch and a series of white 
plastic slivers that fitted together 
to form something that looked 
like a slide-rule with three independent movable scales. The notations upon it struck no chord 
of familiarity to Baley. 

Dr. Gerrigel tapped his bookviewer and smiled a little, as 
though the prospect of a bit of 
fieldwork cheered him. 

He said, "It's my Handbook of 
Robotics. I never go anywhere 
without it. It's like part of me." 

149 



He put the eyepiece of the 
viewer to his eyes and his finger 
dealt delicately with the controls. 
The viewer whirred and stopped, 
whirred and stopped. 

"Built-in index," the roboticist said proudly, his voice muffled because the viewer covered 
his mouth. "I constructed it myself. It saves a great deal of 
time. But that's not the point 
now, is it? Let's see. Umm, won't 
you move your chair near me, 
Daneel?" 

R. Daneel did so. During the 
roboticist's preparations, he had 
watched closely and unemotionally. 

Baley shifted his blaster to 
keep aiming at the robot. 

WHAT followed confused and 
disappointed him. Dr. Gerrigel proceeded to ask questions 
and perform actions that seemed 
without meaning, punctuated by 
references to his triple slide-rule 
and occasionally to the viewer 
itself. 

At one time, he asked, "If I 
have two cousins, five years 
apart in age, and the younger is 
a girl, what sex is the older?" 

Daneel answered, "It is impossible to say on the information given." 

Dr. Gerrigel's only response, 
aside from a glance at his stopwatch, was to extend his right 
hand as far as he could sideways 



and to say, "Would you touch 
the tip of my middle finger with 
the tip of the third finger of your 
left hand?" 

Daneel did that promptly and 
easily. 

In fifteen minutes, Dr. Gerrigel was finished. He used his 
slide-rule for a last silent calculation, then disassembled it with 
a series of snaps. He put away 
his stopwatch, withdrew the 
Handbook from the viewer and 
collapsed the machine. 

"Is that all?" said Baley, 
frowning. 

"That's all." 

"But it's ridiculous. You've 
asked nothing that pertains to the 
First Law." 

"Mr. Baley, when a doctor hits 
your knee with a little rubber 
mallet, don't you accept the fact 
that it gives information concerning the presence or absence 
of some degenerative nerve disease? When he looks closely at 
your eyes and considers the reaction of your iris to light, are 
you surprised that he can tell you 
about your possible addiction to 
the use of certain alkaloids?" 

Baley said, "Well, whit's your 
decision?" 

"Daneel is fully equipped with 
the First Law!" The roboticist 
jerked his head in a sharp affirmative. 

"You can't be right," said 
Baley flatly. 



150 




 



"Are you teaching me my job?" 
The little smile had turned to an 
indignant glare. 

"I don't mean you*re incompetent," said Baley. He put out 
a large, pleading hand. "But 
couldn't you be mistaken? You've 
said yourself nobody knows anything about the theory of nonAsenion robots. A blind man 
could read by using Braille or a 
sound -scriber. Couldn't you, in 
all honesty, say that a man had 
eyes because he knew the contents of a certain book-film, and 
be mistaken?" 

roboticist grew genial 
again. "I see your point. But 
a blind man could not read 
by use of his eyes and that is 
what I was testing, if I may use 
the analogy. Take my word for 
it, regardless of what a nonAsenion robot could or could not 
do, it is certain that R. Daneel is 
equipped with the First Law." 

"Couldn't he have falsified his 
answers?" 

"A human brain, or any mammalian brain, cannot be completely analyzed by any mathematical 
discipline now known. The robot 
brain is completely analyzable, 
or it could not be constructed. 
We know exactly what the responses to given stimuli must be. 
Therefore, no robot can falsify 
answers." 

"Then let's get down to cases," 



said Baley. "R. Daneel did point 
a blaster at a crowd of human beings. I was there. Granted that 
he didn't shoot, wouldn't the 
First Law still have forced him 
into a kind of neurosis? It didn't, 
you know. He was perfectly 
normal afterward." 

The roboticist put a hesitant 
hand to his chin. "That is anomalous." 

"Not at all," said R. Daneel 
suddenly. "Partner Elijah, would 
you look at the blaster that you 
took from me?" 

Baley looked down upon the 
blaster he held cradled in his left 
hand. 

"Break open the charge chamber," urged R. Daneel. "Inspect 
it." 

Baley weighed his chances, 
then slowly put his own blaster 
on the table beside him. With a 
quick movement, he opened the 
robot's blaster. 

"It's empty," he said blankly. 

"There is no charge in it," 
agreed R. Daneel. "If you will 
look closer, you will see that the 
blaster has no ignition-bud and 
cannot be used." 

Baley said, "You held an uncharged blaster on the crowd?" 

"I had to have a blaster or fail 
in my role as plainclothesman," 
said R. Daneel, "yet to carry a 
charged and usable blaster might 
have made it possible for me to 
hurt a human being by accident, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



1S1 



a thing which is, of course, unthinkable. It did not occur to me 
to explain that to a detective because I thought it was obvious. 
I still believe it is." 

Baley stared bleakly at the 
useless blaster in his hand and 
said in a low voice, "I think that's 
all, Dr. Gerrigel. Thank you for 
your help." 

T> ALEY sent out for lunch, but 
when it came (yeast-nut cake 
and a rather extravagant slice of 
fried chicken on cracker) he 
could only stare at it. 

Round and round went the currents of his mind. The immediate 
past stretched behind him like a 
misty improbable dream, dating 
back to the moment he had stepped into Julius Enderby's office 
and found himself suddenly immersed in a nightmare of murder 
and robotics. 

Jehoshaphat, it had begun only 
fifty hours before! 

Persistently, he had sought the 
solution in Spacetown. Twice he 
had accused R. Daneel, once of 
being a human being in disguise, 
and once as an admitted and 
actual robot; each time as a murderer. Twice the accusation had 
been broken. 

Against his will, he was being 
forced to turn his suspicions to 
the City, and since last night he 
dared not. Certain questions battered at his conscious mind, but 



he would not listen. If he heard 
them, he couldn't help but answer them and he didn't want to 
face the answers. 

"Lije! Lije!" A hand shook 
Baley's shoulder roughly. 

Baley stirred and said, "What's 
up, Phil?" 

Philip Norris, Plainclothesman 
C-5, sat down, put his hands on 
his knees and leaned forward, 
peering at Baley's face. "What 
happened to you? Been living on 
knockout drops lately? You were 
sitting there with your eyes open 
and near as I could make out, 
you were dead." 

He rubbed his thinning, pale 
blond hair, and his close-set eyes 
appraised Baley's cooling lunch 
greedily. "Chicken!" he said. "It's 
getting so you can't get it without 
a doctor's prescription." 

"Take some," offered Baley 
listlessly. 

Decorum won out and Norris 
said, "Oh, well, I'm going out to 
eat in a minute. Say, what's doing with the Commish?" 

"What?" 

Norris attempted a casual attitude, but his hands were restless. "You know what I mean. 
You've been living with him ever 
since he got back. What's up? A 
promotion in the works?" 

Baley frowned and felt reality 
return somewhat at the touch of 
office politics. Norris had approximately his own seniority and he 



152 




 



was bound to watch assiduously 
for any sign of official preference. 

Baley said, "No promotion. 
And if it's the Commissioner 
you're wanting, I wish I could 
give him to you!" 

"Don't get me wrong, Lije. I 
don't care if you get promoted. 
I just mean that if you've got 
any pull with the Commish, how 
about using t for the kid?" 

Baley didn't have to ask what 
kid. Vincent Barrett, the youngster who had been moved out of 
his job to make room for R. 
Sammy, was shuffling up from 
an unnoticed corner of the room. 
A skull-cap turned uncomfortably in his hands and the skin 
over his high cheek-bones creased 
as he tried to smile. 

"Hello, Mr. Baley." 

"Oh, hello, Vince. How're you 
doing?" 

"Not so good, Mr. Baley." 

"IflNCE was looking about hun" grily. Baley thought: He 
looks lost, half-dead — declassified. 

Then, savagely, his lips almost 
twisting with the force of his 
emotion, he thought: But what 
does he want from me? 

He said, "I'm sorry, kid." What 
else was there to say? 

"I keep thinking," said the boy. 
"Maybe something has come up." 

Norris moved close and spoke 
into Baley's ear. "Someone's got 



to stop this! They're going to 
push out Chenlow now." 
"What?" 

"Haven't you heard?" 

"No, I haven't. Damn it, he's 
a C-3. He's got ten years behind 
him." 

"I know. But a machine with 
legs can do his work. Who's 
next, now?" 

Young Vince Barrett was oblivious to the whispers. He said 
out of the depths of his own 
thinking, "Mr. Baley?" 

"Yes, Vince?" 

"You know what they say? 
They say Lyrane Millane, the 
dancer, is really a robot." 

"That's silly," 

"Is it? They say they can make 
robots look just like humans; 
give them a special plastic skin, 
sort of." 

Baley thought guiltily of R. 
Daneel and found no words. He 
shook his head. 

The boy said, "Do you suppose 
anyone will mind if I just walk 
around? It makes me feel better 
to see the old place." 

"Go ahead, kid-" 

The youngster wandered off. 
Baley and Norris watched him 
go
Norris said, "Maybe the Medievalists are right. The hell with 
robots. Old Earth has a better 
future without them." 

Baley muttered, "Eight billion 
people and the uranium run


THE CAVES OF STEEL 



153 



ning out! What's better about 
it?" 

"What if the uranium does run 
out? We'll import it. Or we'll 
discover other nuclear processes. 
We can use sun power and that's 
good for billions of years. We 
can build space stations inside 
Mercury's orbit to act as energy 
accumulators. We'll transmit energy to Earth by direct beam." 

This project was not new \o 
Baley. The speculative fringe of 
science had been playing with it 
for a hundred and fifty years at 
least. What was holding it up 
was the impossibility, so far, of 
projecting a beam tight enough 
to reach so many million miles 
without total dissipation, Baley 
said as much. 

Norris argued, "When it's necessary, it'll be done," 

BALEY thought of an Earth 
of unlimited energy. Population could continue to increase; 
the yeast farms could expand; 
hydroponic culture intensify. Energy was the only thing needed. 
The raw minerals could be 
brought in from the uninhabited 
rocks of the System. If ever water 
became a bottleneck, more could 
be brought in from the moons of 
Jupiter. For that matter, the 
oceans could be frozen and 
dragged out into space where they 
could circle Earth as moonlets 
of ice. There they would be. 



always available for use, while 
the ocean bottoms would represent more land for exploitation; 
more room to live. Even carbon 
and oxygen could be maintained 
and increased on Earth through 
utilization of the methane atmosphere of Titan and the frozen 
oxygen of Umbriel. 

Earth's population could reach 
a trillion or two. Why not? There 
was a time when the current 
population of eight billion would 
have been considered impossible. 
Even a population of a single 
billion would have been unthinkable a couple of thousand years 
ago. There had always been 
prophets of Malthusian doom in 
every generation since Medieval 
days and they had always been 
proven wrong. 

What would Fastolfe say? A 
world of a trillion? Surely! But 
they would be dependent on imported air and water and an 
energy supply from complicated 
storehouses millions of miles 
away. Earth would be, and remain, staring over the edge of 
disaster if any single part of the 
program failed. Disruption for 
only one hour would be catastrophic now. What would it be 
then? A minute? A second? Less? 

Baley said, "I think it would 
be easier to ship off some of the 
surplus population." It was more 
an answer to the picture he had 
conjured up than to anything 



154 




 



Norris had just been saying. 

"Who'd have us?" said Norris 
with bitter lightness. 

"Any uninhabited planet." 

Norris rose, patted Baley on 
the shoulder. "Lije, you eat your 
chicken, and recover. You must 
be living on knockout pills.*' 

Baley watched him leave with 
a humorless twist to his mouth. 
Norris would spread the news 
and it would be weeks before 
the office comedians would lay 
off. But at least it got him off 
the subject of young Vince, or 
robots, or declassification. 

He sighed as he put a fork into 
the now-cold and somewhat 
soggy chicken. 

A S Baley finished the last of 
the yeast-nut, R. Daneel left 
his own desk (assigned him that 
morning) and approached. 

Baley eyed him uncomfortably. 
"Well?" 

R. Daneel said, "The Commissioner is not in his office and it 
is not known when he'll be back. 
I've told R. Sammy we will use 
it and that he was to allow no 
one but the Commissioner to enter." 

"What are we going to use it 

for?" 

"Greater privacy. I'm sure you 
agree that we must plan our next 
move. After all, you do not intend to abandon the investigation, do you?" 



That was precisely what Baley 
longed to do, but he rose and 
led the way into Enderby's office. 

The robot said, "Partner Elijah, since last night, you are not 
yourself. There is a definite alteration in your mental aura." 

A horrible thought sprang into 
Baley's mind. "Are you telepathic?" • 

"No, of course not," said R. 
Daneel. 

Baley's panic ebbed. "Then 
what the devil do you mean 
about my mental aura?" 

"It is difficult to explain. You 
will recall that I was originally 
designed to study human psychology for our people back in 
Spacetown." 

"I know. You were adjusted to 
detective work by the simple installation of a justice -desire circuit." Baley did not try to keep 
the sarcasm out of his voice. 

"Exactly, Elijah. But my original design remains essentially 
unaltered. I was constructed for 
the purpose of cerebroanalysis." 

"For analyzing brain waves?" 

"Why, yes. It can be done by 
field -measurements without the 
necessity of direct electrode contact, if the proper receiver exists. 
My mind is such a receiver. Is 
that principle not applied on 
Earth?" 

Baley didn't know. He ignored 
the question and said cautiously, 
"If you measure the brain-waves, 



THE CAVES OF STEEL 



what do you get out of it?" 

"Not thoughts, Elijah. I get a 
glimpse of emotion and, most of 
all, I can analyze temperament, 
the underlying drives and attitudes of a man. For instance, it 
was 1 who was able to ascertain 
that Commissioner Enderby was 
incapable of killing a man under 
the circumstances of*the time of 
the murder." 

"And they eliminated him as a 
suspect on your say-so." 

"It was safe enough to do so. 
I am a very delicate machine in 
that respect." 

Again a thought struck Baley. 
"Wait! Commissioner Enderby 
didn't know he was being cerebroanalyzed, did he?" 

"There was no need to hurt his 
feelings." 

"I mean you just stood there 
and looked at him. No electrodes. 
No needles and graphs." 

"Certainly not. I am a selfcontained unit." 

Baley bit his lower lip in anger 
and chagrin. It had been the one 
remaining inconsistency, the one 
loophole through which a last 
stab might be made to pin the 
crime on Spacetown. 

RDANEEL had stated that 
• the Commissioner had been 
cerebroanalyzed. One hour later, 
the Commissioner himself had, 
with apparent candor, denied any 
knowledge of the term. Certainly 



no man could have undergone the 
shattering experience of electroencephalographic measurements 
by electrode and graph under the 
suspicion of murder without an 
unmistakable impression of what 
cerebroanalysis must be. 

But now that discrepancy had 
evaporated. The Commissioner 
had been cerebroanalyzed and 
had never known it. R. Daneel 
told the truth; so had the Commissioner. 

"Well," said Baley sharply, 
"what does cerebroanalysis tell 
you about me?" 

"You are disturbed." 

"That's a great discovery, isn't 
it? You're damn right I'm disturbed." 

"Specifically, though, your disturbance is due to a clash between motivations within you. On 
the one hand, your devotion to 
the principles of your profession 
urges you to look deeply into this 
conspiracy of Earthmen who lay 
siege to us last night. Another 
motivation, equally strong, forces 
you in the opposite direction. 
This much is apparent in the 
electric field of your cerebral 
cells." 

"My cerebral cells, yeast!" 
snapped Baley. "Look, I'll tell 
you why there's no point in investigating your so-called conspiracy. It has nothing to do with 
the murder. I thought it might 
have. I'll admit that. Yesterday, 




 



in the kitchen, I thought we were 
in danger. But what happened? 
They followed us out, were quick' 
ly lost on the strips and that was 
that. That was not the action of 
well -organized and desperatemen. 

"My own son found out where 
we were staying easily enpugh. 
He called the Department. He 
didn't even have to identify himself. Our alleged conspirators 
could have done the same if they 
had really wanted to get us." 
/ "Didn't they?" 

"Obviously not. If they had 
wanted riots, they could have 
started one at the shoe counter, 
and yet they backed out tamely 
enough before one man and a 
blaster. One robot, and a blaster 
which they must have known you 
would be unable to fire. They're 
Medievalists, harmless crackpots. 
You wouldn't know that, but I 
should have. And I would have, 
if it weren't for the fact that this 
whole business haa me thinking 
in idiotic melodramatic terms. 

"I tell you I know the type 
of people that become Medievalists. They're people who find life 
too hard for them here and get 
lost in an ideal world of the past 
that never really existed. If you 
could cerebroanalyze a movement as you do an individual, you 
would find they are no more capable of murder than Julius Enderby himself." 

R. Daneel said slowly, "I can


not accept your statements at 
face value." 

"What do you mean?" 

"Your conversion to this view 
is too sudden. There are certain 
discrepancies, too. You arranged 
the appointment with Dr. Gerrigel hours before the evening 
meal. You did not know of my 
food sac then and could not have 
suspected me as the murderer. 
Why did you call him?" 

"I suspected you even then." 

"And last night you talked in 
your sleep." 

BALEY'S eyes widened. "What 
did I say?" 
"Merely the one word 'Jessie' 
several times. I believe you were 
referring to your wife." 

Baley let his tight muscles 
loosen. He said shakily, "I had a 
nightmare. Do you know what 
that is?" 

"I do not know by personal 
experience, of course. The dictionary definition is that it is a 
bad dream." 

"And do you know what a 
dream is?" 

"Again, the dictionary definition only. It is an illusion of 
reality experienced during the 
temporary suspension of conscious thought which you call 
sleep." 

"Sometimes the illusions can 
seem damned real. Well, I dreamed my wife was in danger. I

called her name. That happens. 
You can take my word for it." 

"I am only too glad to do so. 
But it brings up a thought. How 
did Jessie find out I was a robot?" 

Baley's forehead went moist 
again. "We're not going into that 
again, are we? The rumor — " 

"I am sorry to interrupt, partner Elijah, but there is no rumor. 
If there were, the City would be 
alive with unrest today. I have 
checked reports coming into the 
Department and there simply is 
no rumor. Therefore, how did 
your wife find out?" 

"Jehoshaphat! What are you 
trying to say? Do you think my 
wife is one of the members of — 
of this — " 

"I do, Elijah." 

Baley gripped his hands together tightly. "Well, she isn't, 
and we won't discuss that point 
any further.'* 

"This is not like you, Elijah. 
In the course of duty, you accused me of murder twice." 

"And is this your way of getting even?" 

"I am not sure I understand 
what you mean by the phrase. I 
approve your readiness to suspect 
me. You had your reasons. They 
were wrong, but they might have 
been right. Equally strong evidence points to your wife." 

"As a murderess? Jessie 
wouldn't hurt her worst enemy. 
She couldn't set foot outside the 



City. She couldn't — Why, if you 
were flesh and blood, I'd — " 

"I merely say that she is a 
member of the conspiracy. I say 
that she should be questioned." 

"Not on whatever it is you call 
your life. Now listen to me. The 
Medievalists aren't after our 
blood. It's not the way they do 
things. But they are trying to get 
you out of the City. And they're 
trying to do it by a kind of psychological attack. They're trying 
to make life unpleasant for you 
and for me, since I'm with you. 
They could easily have found out 
Jessie was my wife, and it was 
an obvious move for them to let 
the news leak to her. She's like 
any other human being. She 
doesn't like robots. She wouldn't 
want me to associate with one, 
especially if she thought it involved danger, and surely they 
would imply that. I tell you it 
worked. She begged all night to 
have me abandon the case or to 
get you out of the City somehow." 

"Presumably," said R. Daneel, 
"you have a very strong urge to 
protect your wife against questioning. It seems obvious to me 
that you are constructing this line 
of argument without really believing it." 

"What the hell do you think 
you are?" yelled Baley. "You're 
not a detective! You're a cerebroanalysis machine like the elec

troencephalographs we have in 
this building! You've got arms, 
legs, a head and can talk, but 
you're not one inch more than 
that machine! Putting a lousy circuit into you doesn't make you a 
detective, so you keep your 
mouth shut and let me do the 
figuring out!" 

The robot said quietly, "I think 
it would be better if you lowered 
your voice, Elijah. Granted that 
I am not a detective in the sense 
that you are, I would still like 
to bring one small item to your 
attention." 

"I'm not interested." 

"If I am wrong, you will tell 
me so, and it will do no harm. 
It is only this. Last night you 
left our room to call Jessie by 
corridor phone. I suggested that 
your son go in your place. You 
told me it was not the custom 
among Earthmen for a father to 
send his son into danger. Is it the 
custom for a mother to do so?" 

"No, of cour — " began Baley, 
and stopped. 

"You see my point," said R. 
Daneel. "Ordinarily, if Jessie 
feared for your safety and wished 
to warn you, she would risk her 
own life, not send her son. The 
fact that she did send Bentley 



could only mean that she felt that 
he would be safe while she herself 
would not. If the conspiracy consisted of people unknown to Jessie, that would not be the case, 
or at least she would have no 
reason to think it to be the case. 
On the other hand, if she were a 
member of the conspiracy, she 
would know — she would know, 
Elijah — that she would be watched for and recognized whereas 
Bentley might get through unnoticed." 

"Wait now," said Baley, sick 
at heart. "That's feather-fine 
reasoning, but — " 

The signal on the Commissioner's desk started flickering madly. R. Daneel waited for Baley to 
answer, but the man could only 
stare at it helplessly. The robot 
closed contact. 

"What is it?" 

R. Sammy's slurring voice 
said, "There is a lady here who 
wishes to see Lije. I told her he 
wm busy, but she will not go 
away. She says her name is 
Jessie." 

"Let her in," said R. Daneel 
calmly, and his brown eyes rose 
unemotionally to meet the panicky glare of Baley's.
