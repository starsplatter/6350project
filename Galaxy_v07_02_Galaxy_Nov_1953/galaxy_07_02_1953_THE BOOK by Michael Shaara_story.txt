THE BOOK by Michael Shaara

months out of the Academy. It 
was a wonderful day. 

The Commandant told Beauclaire to sit down, and sat looking at him for a long while. The 
Commandant was an old man 
with a face of many lines. He 
was old, was hot, was tired. He 
was also very irritated. He had 
reached that point of oldness 
when talking to a young man is 
an irritation because they are so 
bright and certain and don't know 
anything and there is nothing 
you can do about it. 

"All right," the Commandant 
said, "there are a few things I 
have to tell you. Do you know 
where you are going?" 

"No, sir," Beauclaire said 
cheerfully. 

"All right," the Commandant 
said again, "I'll tell you. You 
are going to the Hole in Cygnus. 
You've heard of it, I hope? Good. 
Then you know that the Hole 
is a large dust cloud — estimated 
diameter, ten light-years. We 
have never gone into the Hole, 
for a number of reasons. It's too 
thick for light speeds, it's too 
big, and Mapping Command 
ships are being spread thin. Also, 
until now, we never thought there 
was anything in the Hole worth 
looking at. So we have never gone 
into the Hole. Your ship will 
be the first." 

"Yes, sir," Beauclaire said, eyes 
shining. 



"A few weeks ago," the Commandant said, "one of our amateurs had a lens on the Hole, 
just looking. He saw a glow. He 
reported to us; we checked and 
saw the same thing. There is a 
faint light coming out of the Hole 
— obviously, a sun, a star inside 
the cloud, just far enough in to 
be almost invisible. God knows 
how long it's been there, but we 
do know that there's never been 
a record of a light in the Hole. 
Apparently this star orbited in 
some time ago, and is now on its 
way out. It is just approaching 
the edge of the cloud. Do you 
follow me?" 

"Yes, sir," Beauclaire said. 

"Your job is this: You will 
investigate that sun for livable 
planets and alien life. If you 
find anything — which is highly 
unlikely — you are to decipher the 
language and come right back. A 
Psych team will go out and determine the effects of a starless 
sky upon the alien culture— obviously, these people will never 
have seen the stars." 

rpHE Commandant leaned forward, intent now for the first 
time. 

"Now, this is an important job. 
There were no other linguists 
available , so we' passed over a 
lot of good men to pick you. 
Make no mistake about your 
qualifications. You are nothing

spectacular. But the ship will be 
yours from now on, permanently. 
Have you got that?" 

The young man nodded, grinning from ear to ear. 

"There is something else," the 
Commandant said, and abruptly 
he paused. 

He gazed silently at Beauclaire 
— at the crisp gray uniform, the 
baby-slick cheek — and he thought 
fleetingly and bitterly of the Hole 
in Cygnus which he, an old man, 
would never see. Then he told 
himself sternly to leave off selfpity. The important thing was 
coming up, and he would have to 
say it well. • 

"Listen," he said. The tone of 
his voice was very strong and 
Beauclaire blinked. "You are replacing one of our oldest men. 
One of our best men. His name 
is Billy Wyatt. He — he has been 
with us a long time." The Commandant paused again, his ringers 
toying with the blotter on his 
desk. "They have told you a lot 
of stuff at the Academy, which 
is all very important. But I want 
you to understand something 
else: This Mapping Command is 
a weary business — few men last 
for any length of time, and those 
that do aren't much good in the 
end. You know that. Well, I want 
you to be very careful when you 
talk to Billy Wyatt; and I want 
you to listen to him, because he's 
been around longer than any


body. We're relieving him, yes, 
because he is breaking down. He's 
no good for us any more; he 
has no more nerve. He's lost the 
feeling a man has to have to do 
his job right." 

The Commandant got up slowly and walked around in front of 
Beauclaire, looking into his eyes. 

"When you relieve Wyatt, treat 
him with respect. He's been farther and seen more than any man 
you will ever meet. I want no 
cracks and no pity for that man. 
Because, listen, boy, sooner or 
later the same thing will happen 
to you. Why? Because it's too 
big — " the Commandant gestured 
helplessly with spread hands — 
"it's all just too damn big. Space 
is never so big that it can't get 
bigger. If you fly long enough, 
it will finally get too big to make 
any sense, and you'll start thinking. You'll start thinking that it 
doesn't make sense. On that day, 
we'll bring you back and put you 
into an office somewhere. If we 
leave you alone, you lose ships 
and get good men killed — there's 
nothing we can do when space 
gets too big. That is what happened to Wyatt. That is what 
will happen, eventually, to you. 
Do you understand?" 

The young man nodded uncertainly. 

"And that," the Commandant 
said sadly, "is the lesson for 
today. Take your ship. Wyatt

will go with you on this one trip, 
to break you in. Pay attention to 
what he has to say — it will mean 
something. There's one other 
crewman, a man named Cooper. 
You'll be flying with him now. 
Keep your ears open and your 
mouth shut, except for questions. 
And don't take any chances. 
That's all." 

Beauclaire saluted and rose to 
go. 

"When you see Wyatt," the 
Commandant said, "tell him I 
won't be able to make it down 
before you leave. Too busy. Got 
papers to sign. Got more damn 
papers than the chief has ulcers." 

The young man waited. 

"That, .God help you, is all," 
said the Commandant. 

WYATT saw the letter when 
the young man was still a 
long way off. The white caught 
his eye, and he watched idly for 
a moment. And then he saw the 
fresh green gear on the man's 
back and the look on his face as 
he came up the ladder, and Wyatt 
stopped breathing. . 

He stood for a moment blinking in the sun. Me? he thought 
. . . me? 

Beauclaire reached the platform and threw down his gear, 
thinking that this was one hell 
of a way to begin a career. 

Wyatt nodded to him, but 
didn't say anything. He accepted 



the letter, opened it and read it. 
He was a short man, thick and 
dark and very powerful. The 
lines of his face did not change 
as he read the letter. 

"Well," he said when he was 
done, "thank you." 

There was a long wait, and 
Wyatt said at last: "Is the Commandant coming down?" 

"No, sir. He said he was tied 
up. He said to give you his best." 

"That's nice," Wyatt said. 

After that, neither of them 
spoke. Wyatt showed the new 
man to his room and wished him 
good luck. Then he went back 
to his cabin and sat down to 
think. 

After 28 years in the Mapping 
Command, he had become necessarily immune to surprise; he 
could understand this at once, but 
it would be some time before he 
would react. Well, well, he said 
to himself; but he did not feel it. 

Vaguely, flicking cigarettes onto 
the floor, he wondered why. The 
letter had not given a reason. He 
had probably flunked a physical. 
Or a mental. One or the other, 
each good enough reason. He 
was 47 years old, and this was a 
rough business. Still, he felt 
strong and cautious, and he knew 
he was not afraid. He felt good 
for a long while yet . . . but obviously he was not. 

Well, then, he thought, where 
now? 



48 




 



He considered that with interest. There was no particular place 
for him to go. Really no place. 
He had come into the business 
easily and naturally, knowing 
what he wanted — which was 
simply to move and listen and 
see. When he was young, it had 
been adventure alone that drew 
him; now it was something else 
he could not define, but a thing 
he knew he needed badly. He had 
to see, to watch . . . and understand. 

It was ending, the long time 
was ending. It didn't matter 
what was wrong with him. The 
point was that he was through. 
The point was that he was going 
home, to nowhere in particular. 

When evening came, he was 
still in his room. Eventually he'd 
been able to accept it all and 
examine it clearly, and had decided that there was nothing to 
do. If there was anything out in 
space which he had not yet 
found, he would not be likely to 
need it. 

He left off sitting, and went up 
to the control room. 

COOPER was waiting for him. 
Cooper was a tall, bearded, 
scrawny man with a great temper 
and a great heart and a small 
capacity for liquor. He was sitting all alone in the room when 
Wyatt entered. 
Except for the pearl-green glow 



of dashlights from the panel, the 
room was dark. Cooper was lying 
far back in the pilot's seat, his 
feet propped up on the panel. 
One shoe was off, and he was 
carefully pressing buttons with 
his huge bare toes. The first thing 
Wyatt saw when he entered was 
the foot glowing luridly in the 
green light of the panel. Deep 
within the ship he could hear the 
hum of the dynamos starting and 
stopping. 

Wyatt grinned. From the play 
of Coop's toes, and the attitude, 
and the limp, forgotten pole of 
an arm which hung down loosely 
from the chair, it was obvious 
that Coop was drunk. In port, 
he was usually drunk. He was a 
lean, likable man with very few 
cares and no manners at all, 
which was typical of men in that 
Command. 

"What say, Billy?" Coop mumbled from deep in the seat. 

Wyatt sat down. "Where you 
been?" 

"In the port. Been drinkin' in 
the goddam port. Hot!" 

"Bring back any?" 

Coop waved an arm floppUy 
in no particular direction. "Look 
around." 

The flasks lay in a heap by 
the door. Wyatt took one and 
sat down again. The room was 
warm and green and silent. The 
two men had been together long 
enough to be able to sit without

speaking, and in the green glow 
they waited, thinking. The first 
pull Wyatt took was long and 
numbing; he closed his eyes. 

Coop did not move at all. Not 
even his toes. When-Wyatt had 
begun to think he was asleep, he 
said suddenly: 

"Heard about the replacement." 

Wyatt looked at him. 

"Found out this afternoon," 
Coop said, "from the goddam 
Commandant." 

Wyatt closed his eyes again. 

' 'Where you goin' ?" Coop 
asked. 

Wyatt shrugged. "Plush job." 

"You got any plans?" 

Wyatt shook his head. 

Coop swore moodily. "Never 
let you alone," he muttered. 
"Miserable bastards." He rose up 
suddenly in the chair, pointing a 
long matchstick finger into 
Wyatt's face. "Listen, Billy," he 
said with determination, "you 
was a good man, you know that? 
You was one hell of a good goddam man." 

Wyatt took another long pull 
and nodded, smiling. 

"You said it," he said. 

"I sailed with some good men, 
some good men," Coop insisted, 
stabbing shakily but emphatically 
with his finger, "but you don't 
take nothin' from nobody." . 

"Here's to me, I'm true blue," 
Wyatt grinned.

/^OOP sank back in the chair, 
^ satisfied. "I just wanted you 
should know. You been a good 
man." 

"Betcher sweet life," Wyatt 
said. 

"So they throw you out. Me 
they keep. You they throw out. 
They got no brains." 

Wyatt lay back, letting the 
liquor take hold, receding without pain into a quiet world. The 
ship was good to feel around 
him, dark and throbbing like a 
living womb. Just like a womb, 
he thought. It's a lot like a womb. 

"Listen," Coop said thickly, 
rising from his chair. "I think 
I'll quit this racket. What the 
hell I wanna stay in this racket 
for?" 

Wyatt looked up, startled. 
When Coop was drunk, he was 
never a little drunk. He was 
always far gone, and he could 
be very mean. Wyatt saw now 
that he was down deep and 
sinking; that the replacement was 
a big thing to him, bigger than 
Wyatt had expected. In this 
team, Wyatt had been the leader, 
and it had seldom occurred to 
him that Coop really needed him. 
He had never really thought 
about it. But now he let himself 
realize that, alone, Coop could 
be very bad. Unless this new 
man was worth anything and 
learned quickly, Coop would 
very likely get himself killed. 



Now, more than ever, this replacement thing was ridiculous; 
but for Coop's sake, Wyatt said 
quickly: 

"Drop that, man. You'll be on 
this ship in the boneyard. You 
even look like this ship — you got 
a bright red bow." 

When the tall man was dark 
and silent, Wyatt said gently, 
"Coop. Easy. We leave at midnight. Want me to take her up?" 

"Naw." Coop turned away 
abruptly, shaking his head. 
"T'hell with you. Go die." He 
sank back deeply in the seat, his 
gaunt face reflecting the green 
glow from the panel. His next 
words were sad, and, to Wyatt, 
very touching. 

"Hell, Billy," Coop said wearily, "this ain' no fun." 

Wyatt let him take the ship up 
alone. There was no reason to 
argue about it. Coop was drunk; 
his mind was unreachable. 

At midnight, the ship bucked 
and heaved and leaped up into 
the sky. Wyatt hung tenuously 
to a stanchion by a port, watched 
the night lights recede and the 
stars begin blooming. In a few 
moments the last clouds were 
past, and they were out in the 
long night, and the million million speckled points of glittering 
blue and red and silver burned 
once more with the mighty light 
which was, to Wyatt, all that was 
real or had ever meant living. In 



52 




 



the great glare and the black he 
stood, as always, waiting for 
something to happen, for the huge 
lonely beauty to resolve itself to 
a pattern and descend and be understood. 

It did not. It was just space, 
an area in Which things existed, 
in which mechanized substance 
moved. Wondering, waiting, Wyatt regarded the Universe. The 
stars looked icily back. 

At last, almost completely 
broken, Wyatt went to bed. 

TJEAUCLAIRE'S first days 
passed very quickly. He spent 
them in combing the ship, seeking 
her out in her deepest layers, 
watching and touching and loving. The ship was to him like a 
woman; the first few days were 
his honeymoon. Because there is 
no lonelier job that a man tan 
have, it was nearly always this 
way with men in the Command. 

Wyatt and Cooper left him 
pretty much alone. They did not 
come looking for him, and the 
few times that he did see them 
he could not help but feel their 
surprise and resentment. Wyatt 
was always polite. Cooper was 
not. Neither seemed to have anything to say to Beauclaire, and 
he was wise enough to stay by 
himself. Most of Beauclaire's life 
until now had been spent among 
books and dust and dead, ancient 
languages. He was by nature a 



solitary man, and therefore it was 
not difficult for him to be alone. 

On a morning some weeks after 
the trip began, Wyatt came looking for him. His eyes twinkling, 
Wyatt fished him up, greasecoated and embarrassed, out of a 
shaft between the main dynamos. 
Together they went up toward 
the astrogation dome. And under 
the great dome, beneath the massive crystal sheet on the other 
side of which there was nothing 
for ever and ever, Beauclaire saw 
a beauty which he was to remember as long as he lived. 

They were nearing the Hole in 
Cygnus. On the side which faces 
the center of the Galaxy the Hole 
is almost flat, from top to bottom, 
like a wall. They were moving 
in on the flat side now, floating 
along some distance from the 
wall, which was so huge and incredible that Beauclaire was 
struck dumb. 

It began above him, light-years 
high. It came down in a black, 
folding, rushing silence, fell away 
beneath him for millions upon 
millions of miles, passed down beyond sight so far away, so unbelievably far away and so vast, 
that there could be nothing as 
big as this, and if he had not 
seen the stars still blazing on 
either side he would have had to 
believe that the wall was just outside the glass, so close he could 
touch it. From all over the wall 



THE BOOK 



53 



a haze reflected faintly, so that 
the wall stood out in ridges and 
folds from the great black of 
space. Beauclaire looked up and 
then down, and then stood and 
gazed. 

After a while, Wyatt pointed 
silently down. Beauclaire looked 
in among the folds and saw it, the 
tiny yellow gleam toward which 
they were moving. It was so small 
against the massive cloud that 
he lost it easily. 

Each time he took his eyes 
away, he lost it, and had to 
search for it again. 

"It's not too far in," Wyatt 
said at last, breaking the silence. 
"We'll move down the cloud to 
the nearest point, then we'll slow 
down and move in. Should take a 
couple of days." 

Beauclaire nodded. 

"Thought you'd like to see," 
Wyatt said. 

"Thanks." Beauclaire was sincerely grateful. And then, unable 
to contain himself, he shook his 
head with wonder. "My God!" he 
said. 

Wyatt smiled. "It's a big 
show." 

Later, much later, Beauclaire 
began to remember what the 
Commandant had said about 
Wyatt. But he could not understand it at all. Sure, something 
like the Hole was incomprehensible. It did not make any sense — 
but so what? A thing as beautiful 



as that, Beauclaire thought, did 
not have to make sense. 

HpHEY reached the sun slowly. 

The gas was not thick by any 
Earthly standards — approximately one atom to every cubic mile 
of space — but for a starship, any 
matter at all is too much. At 
normal speeds, the ship would 
hit the gas like a wall. So they 
came in slowly, swung in and 
around the large yellow sun. 

They saw one planet almost 
immediately. While moving in toward that one they scanned for 
others, found none at all. 

Space around them was absolutely strange; there was nothing 
in the sky but a faint haze. They 
were in the cloud now, and of 
course could see no star. There 
was nothing but the huge sun and 
the green gleaming dot of that 
one planet, and the endless haze. 

From a good distance out, Wyatt and Cooper ran through the 
standard tests while Beauclaire 
watched with grave delight. They 
checked for radio signals, found 
none. The spectrum of the planet 
revealed strong oxygen and watervapor lines, surprisingly little 
nitrogen. The temperature, while 
somewhat cool, was in the livable 
range. 

It was a habitable planet. 

"Jackpot!" Coop said cheerfully. "All that oxygen, bound to 
be some kind of life." 



54 




 



Wyatt said nothing. He was 
sitting in the pilot chair, his huge 
hands on the controls, nursing 
the ship around into the long 
slow spiral which would take 
them down. He was thinking of 
many other things, many other 
landings. He was remembering 
the acid ocean at Lupus and the 
rotting disease of Altair, all the 
dark, vicious, unknowable things 
he had approached, unsuspecting, 
down the years. 

... So many years, that now 
he suddenly realized it was too 
long, too long. 

Cooper, grinning unconsciously 
as he scanned with the telescope, 
did not notice Wyatt's sudden 
freeze. 

It was over all at once.. Wyatt's 
knuckles had gradually whitened 
as he gripped the panel. Sweat 
had formed on his face and run 
down into his eyes, and he blinked, and realized with a strange 
numbness that he was soaking 
wet all over. In that moment, 
his hands froze and gripped the 
panel, and he could not move 
them. 

It was a hell of a thing to happen on a man's last trip, he 
thought. He would like to have 
taken her down just this once. 
He sat looking at his hands. 
Gradually, calmly, carefully, with 
a cold will and a welling sadness, he broke his hands away 
from the panel. 



"Coop/' he said, "take over." 

Coop glanced over and saw. 
Wyatt's faqe was white and 
glistening; his hands in front of 
him were wooden and strange. 

"Sure," Coop said, after a very 
long moment. "Sure." 

Wyatt backed off, and Coop 
slid into the seat. 

"They got me just in time," 
Wyatt said, looking at his stiff, 
still fingers. He looked up and 
ran into Beauclaire's wide eyes, 
and turned away from the open 
pity. Coop was bending over the 
panel, swallowing heavily. 

"Well," Wyatt said. He was 
beginning to cry. He walked 
slowly from the room, his hands 
held before him like old gray 
things that had died. 

fT^HE ship circled automatically 
throughout the night, while 
its crew slept or tried to. In the 
morning they were all forcefully 
cheerful and began to work up an 
interest. 

There were people on the 
planet. Because the people lived 
in villages, and had no cities and 
no apparent science, Coop let the 
ship land. 

It was unreal. For a long while, 
none of them could get over the 
feeling of unreality, Wyatt least 
of all. He stayed in the ship and 
got briefly drunk, and then came 
out as carefully efficient as ever. 
Coop was gay and brittle. Only 



THE BOOK

Beauclaire saw the planet with 
any degree of clarity. And all the 
while the people looked back. 

From the very beginning it was 
peculiar. 

The people saw the ship passing overhead, yet curiously they 
did not run. They gathered in 
groups and watched. When the 
ship landed, a small band of them 
came out of the circling woods 
and hills and ringed the ship, 
and a few came up and touched it 
calmly, ran fingers over smooth 
steel sides. 

The people were human. 

There was not, so far as Beauclaire could tell, a single significant difference. It was not really 
extraordinary — similar conditions 
will generally breed similar races 
— but there was something about 
these men and women which was 
hard and powerful, and in a way 
almost grand. 

They were magnificently built, 
rounded and bronzed. Their women especially were remarkably 
beautiful. They were wearing 
woven clothes of various colors, 
in simple savage fashions; but 
there was nothing at all savage 
about them. They did not shout 
or seem nervous or move around 
very much, and nowhere among 
them was there any sign of a 
weapon. Furthermore, they did 
not seem to be particularly curious. The ring about the ship 
did not increase. Although sev


eral new people wandered in from 
time to time, others were leaving, 
unconcerned. The only ones 
among them who seemed at all 
excited were the children. 

Beauclaire stood by the viewscreen, watching. Eventually 
Coop joined him, looking without 
interest until he saw the women. 
There was one particular girl 
with shaded brown eyes and a 
body of gentle hills. Coop grinned 
widely and turned up the magnification until the screen showed 
nothing but the girl. He was gazing with appreciation and making side comments to Beauclaire 
when Wyatt came in. 

"Looka that, Billy," Coop 
roared with delight, pointing. 
"Man, we have come home!" 

WYATT smiled very tightly, 
changed the magnification 
quickly to cover the whole throng 
around them. 
"No trouble?" 

"Nope," Coop said. "Air's 
good, too. Thin, but practically 
pure oxygen. Who's first to go 
out?" 

"Me," Wyatt said, for obvious 
reasons. He would not be missed. 

No one argued with him. Coop 
was smiling as Wyatt armed himself. Then he warned Wyatt to 
leave that cute little brown-eyed 
doll alone. 

Wyatt went out. 

The air was clear and cool. 



56 




 



There was a faint breeze stirring 
the leaves around him, and Wyatt 
listened momentarily to the far 
bell-calls of birds. This would be 
the last time he would ever go 
out like this, to walk upon an 
unknown world. He waited for 
some time by the airlock before 
he went forward. 

The ring of people did not 
move as he approached, his hand 
upraised in what the Mapping 
Command had come to rely on as 
the universal gesture of peace. 
He paused before a tall, monolithic old man in a single sheath 
of green cloth. 

"Hello," he said aloud, and 
bowed his head slowly. 

From the ship, through the 
wide-angle sights of a gun, Beauclaire watched breathlessly as 
Wyatt went through the pantomime of greeting. 

None of the tall people moved, 
except the old man, who folded 
his arms and looked openly 
amused. When the pantomime 
was done, Wyatt bowed again. 
The old man broke into a broad 
grin, looked amiably around at 
the circle of people, and then 
quite suddenly bowed to Wyatt. 
One by one the people, grinning, 
bowed. 

Wyatt turned and waved at the 
ship, and Beauclaire stood away 
from his gun, smiling. 

It was a very fine way to begin. 



IN the morning Wyatt went out 
alone, to walk in the sun 
among the trees, and he found 
the girl he had seen from the 
ship. She was sitting alone by a 
stream, her feet cooling and 
splashing in the clear water. 

Wyatt sat down beside her. 
She looked up, unsurprised, out 
of eyes that were rich and grained 
like small pieces of beautiful 
wood. Then she bowed, from the 
waist. Wyatt grinned and bowed 
back. 

Unceremoniously he took off 
his boots and let his feet plunk 
down into the water. It was 
shockingly cold, and he whistled. 
The girl smiled at him. To his 
surprise, she began to hum softly. 
It was a pretty tune that he was 
able to follow, and after a moment he picked up the harmony 
and hummed along with her. She 
laughed, and he laughed with her, 
feeling very young. 

Me Billy, he thought of saying, 
and laughed again. He was content just to sit without saying 
anything. Even her body, which 
was magnificent, did not move 
him to anything but a quiet admiration, and he regarded himself with wonder. 

The girl picked up one of his 
boots and examined it critically, 
clucking with interest. Her lovely 
eyes widened as she played with 
the buckle. Wyatt showed her 
how the snaps worked and she

sr 



was delighted and clapped her 
hands. 

Wyatt brought other things out 
of his pockets arid she examined 
them all, one after the other. The 
picture of him on his ID card 
was the only one which seemed 
to puzzle her. She handled it and 
looked at it, and then at him, and 
shook her head- Eventually she 
frowned and gave it definitely 
' back to him. He got the impression that she thought it was very 
bad art. He chuckled. 

The afternoon passed quickly, 
and the sun began to go down. 
They hummed some more and 
sang songs to each other which 
neither understood and both enjoyed, and it did not occur to 
Wyatt until much later how little 
curiosity they had felt. They did 
not speak at all. She had no interest in his language or his name, 
and, strangely, he felt all through 
the afternoon that talking was unnecessary. It was a very rare day 
spent between two people who 
were not curious and did not 
want anything from each other. 
The only words they said to each 
other were goodbye. 

Wyatt, lost inside himself, 
plodding, went back to the ship. 

IN the first week, Beauclaire 
spent his every waking hour 
learning the language of the 
planet. From the very beginning 
he had felt an unsettling, peculiar 

58 



manner about these pople. Their 
behavior was decidedly unusual. 
Although they did not differ in 
any appreciable way from human beings, they did not act 
very much like human beings in 
that they were almost wholly 
lacking a sense of awe, a sense of 
wonder. Only the children seemed 
surprised that the ship had landed, and only the children hung 
around and inspected it- Almost 
all the others went off about their 
regular business — which seemed 
to be farming — and when Beauclaire tried learning the language, 
he found very few of the people 
willing to spend time enough to 
teach him. 

But they were always more or 
less polite, and by making a pest 
of himself he began to succeed. 
On another day when Wyatt 
came back from the brown-eyed 
girl, Beauclaire reported some 
progress. 

"It's a beautiful language," he 
said as Wyatt came in. "Amazingly well -developed. It's something like our Latin — same type 
of construction, but much softer 
and more flexible. I've been trying 
to read their book," 

Wyatt sat down thoughtfully 
and lit a cigarette. 

"B x>k?" he said. 

"Yes. They have a lot of books, 
but everybody has this one particular book — they keep it in a 
place of honor in their houses. 


 



i ve tried to ask them what it is— 
I think it's a bible of some kind — 
>ut they just won't bother to tell 

ae." 

Wyatt shrugged, his mind drifting away. 

"I just don't understand them," 
Beauclaire said plaintively, glad 
to have someone to talk to. "I 
lon't get them at all. They're 
iuick, they're bright, but they 
liaven't the damnedest bit of curiosity about anything, not even 
each other. My God, they don't 
even gossip!" 

Wyatt, contented, puffed quietly. "Do you think not seeing the 
stars has something to do with 
it? Ought to have slowed down 
the development of physics and 
math." 

Beauclaire shook his head. "No. 
It's very strange. There's something else. Have you noticed the 
way the ground seems to be sharp 
and j agged almost everywhere 
you look, sort of chewed up as if 
there was a war? Yet these people swear that they've never had 
a war within living memory, and 
they don't keep any history so 
a man could really find out." 

When Wyatt didn't say anything, he went on: 

"And 1 can't see the connection 
about no stars. Not with these 
people. I don't care if you can't 
see the roof of the house you live 
in, you still have to have a certain amount of curiosity in order 



to stay alive. But these people 
just don't give a damn. The ship 
landed. You remember that? Out 
of the sky come Gods like thunder — " 

"WTYATT smiled. At another 
" time, at any time in the 
past, he would have been very 
much interested in this sort of 
thing. But now he was not. He 
felt himself — remote, sort of — 
and he, like these people, did not 
particularly give a damn. 

But the problem bothered 
Beauclaire, who was new and 
fresh and looking for reasons, and 
it also bothered Cooper. 

"Damn !" Coop grumbled as 
he came stalking into the room. 
"Here you are, Billy. I'm bored 
stiff. Been all over this whole 
crummy place lookin for you. 
Where you been?" He folded himself into a chair, scratched his 
black hair broodingly with long, 
sharp fingers. "Game o' cards?" 

"Not just now, Coop," Wyatt 
said, lying back and resting. 

Coop grunted. "Nothin to do, 
nothin to do." he swiveled his 
eyes to Beauclaire. "How you 
comin, son? How soon we leave 
this place? Like Sunday afternoon all the time." 

Beauclaire was always ready to 
talk about the problem. He outlined it now to Cooper again, and 
Wyatt, listening, grew very tired. 
There is just this one continent, 



THE BOOK 



59 



Beauclaire said, and just one nation, and everyone spoke the 
same tongue. There was no government, no police, no law that 
he could find. There was not 
even, as far as he could tell, a 
system of marriage. You couldn't 
even call it a society, really, but 
dammit, it existed — and Beauclaire could not find a single trace 
of rape or murder or violence of 
any kind. The people here, he 
said, just didn't give a damn. 



"You said it," Coop boomed. 
"I think they're all whacky." 

"But happy," Wyatt said suddenly. "You can see that they're 
happy." 

"Sure, they're happy," Coop 
chortled. "They're nuts. They 
got funny looks in their eyes. 
Happiest guys I know are screwy 
as — ". 

The sound which cut him off, 
which grew and blossomed and 
eventually explained everything, 



60 



6A1AXY SCIENCE FICTION 



had begun a few seconds ago, 
too softly to be heard. Now suddenly, from a slight rushing 
noise, it burst into an enormous, 
thundering scream. 

They leaped up together, horrified, and an overwhelming, gigantic blast threw them to the 
floor. 

fTlHE ground rocked, the ship 
fluttered and settled crazily. 
In that one long second, the 



monstrous noise of a world collapsing grew in the air and filled 
the room, filled the men and 
everything with one incredible, 
crushing, grinding shock. 

When it was over there was another rushing sound, farther 
away, and another, and two more 
tremendous explosions; and 
though all in all the noise lasted 
for perhaps five seconds, it was 
the greatest any of them had 
ever heard, and the world beneath

them continued to flutter, wounded and trembling, for several 
minutes. 

Wyatt was first out of the ship, 
shaking his head as he ran to get 
back his hearing. To the west, 
over a long slight rise of green 
and yellow trees, a vast black 
cloud of smoke, several miles 
long and very high, was rising 
and boiling. As he stared and 
tried to steady his feet upon the 
shaking ground, he was able to 
gather himself enough to realize 
what this was. 

Meteors. 

He had heard meteors before, 
long before, on a world of Aldebaran. Now he could smell the 
same sharp burning disaster, and 
feel the wind rushing wildly back 
to the west, where the meteors 
had struck and hurled the air 
away. 

In that moment Wyatt thought 
of the girl, and although she 
meant nothing to him at all — 
none of these people meant anything in the least to him — he began running as fast as he could 
toward- the west. 

Behind him, white-faced and 
bewildered, came Beauclaire and 
Cooper. 

When Wyatt reached the top of 
the rise, the great cloud covered 
the whole valley before him. Fires 
were burning in the crushed forest 
to his right, and from the lay of 
the cloud he could tell that the 



village of the people was not 
there any more. 

He ran down into the smoke, ; 
circling toward the woods and 
the stream where he had passed 
an afternoon with the girl. For 
a while he lost himself in the 
smoke, stumbling over rocks and 
fallen trees. 

Gradually the smoke lifted, and 
he began running into some of 
the people. Now he wished that 
he could speak the language. 

They were all wandering quietly away from the site of their 
village, none of them looking 
back. Wyatt could see a great i 
many dead as he moved, but he 
had no time to stop, no time to 
wonder. It was twilight now, and 
the sun was gone. He thanked 
God that he had a flashlight 
with him; long after night came, 
he was searching in the raw gash 
where the first meteor had f alien.. 

He found the girl, dazed and 
bleeding, in a cleft between two 
rocks. He knelt and took her in 
his arms. Gently, gratefully, 
through the night and the fires 
and past the broken and the 
dead, he carried her back to the 
ship. 

IT had all become frighteningly 
clear to Beauclaire. He talked 
with the people and began to 
understand. 

The meteors had been falling 
since the beginning of time, so the 



62 




 



people said. Perhaps it was the 
fault of the great dust-cloud 
through which this planet was 
moving; perhaps it was that this 
had not always been a one-planet 
system — a number of other planets, broken and shredded by unknown .gravitational forces, 
would provide enough meteors 
for a very long time. And the air 
of this planet being thin, there 
was no real protection as there 
was on Earth. So year after year 
the meteors fell. In unpredictable 
places, at unknowable times, the 
meteors fell, like stones from the 
sling of God. They had been falling since the beginning of time. 
So the people, the unconcerned 
people, said. 

And here was Beauclaire's clue. 
Terrified and shaken as he was, 
Beauclaire was the kind of man 
who saw reason in everything. He 
followed this one to the end. 

In the meantime, Wyatt nursed 
the girl. She had not been badly 
hurt, and recovered quickly. But 
her family and friends were mostly dead now, and so she had no 
reason to leave the ship. 

Gradually Wyatt learned the 
language. The girl's name was 
ridiculous when spoken in English, so he called her Donna, 
which was something like her real 
name. She was, like all her people, unconcerned about the meteors and her dead. She was 
extraordinarily cheerful. Her fea


tures were classic, her cheeks 
slim and smiling, her teeth perfect. In the joy and whiteness of 
her, Wyatt saw each day what 
he had seen and known in his 
mind on the day the meteors 
fell. Love to him was something 
new. He was not sure whether or 
not he was in love, and he did 
not care. He realized that he 
needed this girl and was at home 
with her, could rest with her and 
talk with her, and watch her walk 
and understand what beauty was ; 
and in the ship in those days a 
great peace began to settle over 
him. 

When the girl was well again, 
Beauclaire was in the middle of 
translating the book — the biblelike book which all the people 
seemed to treasure so much. As 
his work progressed, a striking 
change began to come over him. 
He spent much time alone under 
the sky, watching the soft haze 
through which, very soon, the 
stars would begin to shine. 

He tried to explain what he felt 
to Wyatt, but Wyatt had no 
time. 

"But, Billy," Beauclaire said 
fervently, "do you see what these 
people go through? Do you see 
how they live?" 

Wyatt nodded, but his eyes 
were on the girl as she sat listening dreamily to a recording of 
ancient music. 

"They live every day waiting," 



THE BOOK 



63 



Beauclaire said. "They have no 
idea what the meteors are. They 
don't know that there is anything 
else in the Universe but their 
planet and their sun. They think 
that's all there is. They don't 
know why they're here — but 
when the meteors keep falling 
like that, they have only one conclusion." 

W/"YATT turned from the girl 
smiling absently. None of 
this could touch him. He had 
seen the order and beauty of 
space, the incredible perfection 
of the Universe, so often and so 
deeply that, like Beauclaire, he 
could not help but believe in a 
Purpose, a grand final meaning. 
When his father had died of an 
insect bite at Oberon he had believed in a purpose for that, and 
had looked for it? When his first 
crewmate fell into the acid ocean 
of Alcestis and the second died of 
a horrible rot, Wyatt had seen 
purpose, purpose; and each time 
another man died, for no apparent reason, on windless, evil useless worlds, the meaning of things 
had become clearer and clearer, 
and now in the end Wyatt was 
approaching the truth, which was 
perhaps that none of it mattered 
at all. 

It especially did not matter 
now. So many things had happened that he had lost the capacity to pay attention. He was not 



young any more; he wanted to ; 
rest, and upon the bosom of this 
girl he had all the reason for anything and everything he needed. 

But Beauclaire was incoherent. 
It seemed to him that here on this 
planet a great wrong was being 
done, and the more he thought of 
it .the more angry and confused 
he became. He went off by himself and looked at the terrible 
wound on the face of the planet, 
at all the sweet, lovely, fragrant 
things which would never be 
again, and he ended by cursing 
the nature of things, as Wyatt 
had done so many years before. 
And then he went on with the 
translation of the book. He came 
upon the final passage, still cursing inwardly, and reread it again 
and again. When the sun was 
rising on a brilliant new morning, he went back to the ship. 

"They had a man here once," 
he said to Wyatt, "who was as 
good a writer as there ever was. 
He wrote a book which these 
people use as their Bible. It's like 
our Bible sometimes, but mostly 
it's just the opposite. It preaches 
that a man shouldn't worship 
anything. Would you like to hear 
some of it?" 

Wyatt had been pinned down 
and he had to listen, feeling sorry 
for Beauclaire, who had such a 
long way to go. His thoughts 
were on Donna, who had gone 
out alone to walk in the woods 



64 




 



and say goodbye to her world. 
Soon he would go out and bring 
her back to the ship, and she 
would probably cry a little, but 
she would come. She would come 
with him always, wherever he 
went. 

"I have translated this the best 
way I could," Beauclaire said 
thickly, "but remember this. This 
man could write. He was Shakespeare and Voltaire and all the 
rest all at once. He could make 
you feel. I couldn't do a decent 
translation if I tried forever, but 
please listen and try to get what 
he means. I've put it in the style 
of Ecclesiastes because it's something like that." 

"All right," Wyatt said. 

¥>EAUCLAIRE waited for a 
" long moment, feeling this 
deeply. When he read, his voice 
was warm and strong, and something of his emotion came 
through. As Wyatt listened, he 
found his attention attracted, and 
then he felt the last traces of his 
sadness and weariness fall away. 

He nodded, smiling. 

These are the words Beauclaire 
had gathered from the Book: 

Rise up smiling, and walk with me. 
Rise up in the armor of thy body and 
what shall pass shall make thee unafraid. Walk among the yellow hills, 
for they belong to thee. Walk upon 
grasj and let thy feet descend into soft 
soil; in the end when all has failed 
thee the soil shall comfort thee, the 



soil shall receive thee and in thy dark 
bed thou shalt find such peace as is 
thy portion. 

In thine armor, hear my voice. In 
thine armor, hear. Whatsoever thou 
doest, thy friend and thy brother and 
thy woman shall betray thee. Whatsoever thou dost plant, the weeds and 
the seasons shall spite thee. Wheresoever thou goest, the heavens shall fall 
upon thee. Though the nations shall 
come unto thee in friendship thou art 
curst. Know that the Gods ignore thee. 
Know that thou art Life, and that pain 
shall forever come into thee, though 
thy years be without end and thy days 
without sleep, even and forever. And 
knowing this, in thine armor, thou 
shalt rise up. 

Red and full and glowing is thy 
heart; a steel is forging within thy 
breast. And what can hurt thee now? 
In thy granite mansion, what can hurt 
thee ever? Thou shalt only die. Therefore seek not redemption nor forgiveness for thy sins, for know that thou 
hast never sinned. 

Let the Gods come unto thee. 

When it was' finished, Wyatt 
sat very still. 

Beauclaire was looking at him 
intently. 

Wyatt nodded. "I see," he said. 

"They don't ask for anything," 
Beauclaire said. "No immortality, 
no forgiveness, no happiness. 
They take what comes and don't 
—wonder." 

Wyatt smiled, rising. He looked at Beauclaire for a long while, 
trying to think of something to 
say. But there was nothing to 
say. If the young man could believe this, here and now, he would 
save himself a long, long, painful journey. But Wyatt could not

65 



talk about it — not just yet. 

He reached out and clapped 
Beauclaire gently upon the shoulder. Then he left the ship and 
walked out toward the yellow 
hills, toward the girl and the love 
that was waiting. 

"WTH-AT will they do, Beau" claire asked himself, when 
the stars come out? When there 
are other places to go, will these 
people, too, begin to seek? 

They would. With sadness, he 
knew that they would. For there 



is a chord in Man which is pluck- ' 
ed by the stars, which will rise ; 
upward and outward into infinity, ; 
as long as there is one man anywhere and one lonely place to 
which he has not been. And therefore what does the meaning matter? We are built in this way, and 
so shall we live. 

Beauclaire looked up into the 
sky. 

Dimly, faintly, like God's eye 
peeking through the silvery haze, 
a single star had begun to shine.
