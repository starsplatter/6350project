Zeritsky's Law by ANN GRIFFITH 




SOMEBODY someday will 
make a study of the influence of animals on history. 
Although not as famous as Mrs. 
O'Leary's cow, Mrs. Graham's 
cat should certainly be included 
in any such study. It has now 
been definitely established that 



the experiences of this cat led 
to the idea of quick-frozen people, 
which, in turn, led to the passage 
of Zeritsky's Law. 

We must go back to the files 
of the Los Angeles newspapers 
for 1950 to find the story. In 
brief, a Mrs. Fred C. Graham 
 



missed her pet cat on the same 
day that she put a good deal of 
food down in her home deepfreeze unit. She suspected ho connection between the two events. 
The cat was not to be found 
until six days later, when its 
owner went to fetch something 
from the deep-freeze. Much as 
she loved her pet, we may imagine 
that she was more horror- than 
grief- stricken at her discoveryShe lifted the little ice-encased 
body out of the deep-freeze and 
set it on the floor. Then she 
managed to run as far as the 
next door neighbor's house before 
fainting. 

Mrs. Graham became hysterical after she was revived, and 
it was several hours before she 
could be quieted enough to persuade anybody that she hadn't 
made up the whole thing. She 
prevailed upon her neighbor to 
go back to the house with her. 
In front of the deep-freeze they 
found a small pool of water, and 
a wet cat, busily licking itself. 
The neighbor subsequently told 
reporters that the cat was concentrating its licking on one of 
its hind legs, where some ice still 
remained, so that she, for one, 
believed the story. 

A follow-up dispatch, published a week later, reported that 
the cat was unharmed by the adventure. Further, Mrs. Graham 
was quoted as saying that the 



cat had had a large meal just 
before its disappearance; that as 
soon after its rescue as it had 
dried itself off, it took a long 
hap, precisely as it always did 
after a meal; and that it was not 
hungry again until evening. It was 
clear from the accounts that the 
life processes had been stopped 
dead in their tracks, and had, 
after defrosting, resumed at exactly the point where they left 
off. 

Perhaps it Is unfair to put all 
the responsibility on one luckless 
cat. Had such a thing happened 
anywhere else in the country, it 
would have been talked about, 
believed by a few, disbelieved by 
most, and forgotten. But as the 
historic kick of Mrs. O'Leary's 
cow achieved significance because 
of the time and place that it was 
delivered, so the falling of Mrs. 
Graham's cat into the deep-freeze 
became significant because it occurred in Los Angeles. There, and 
probably only there, the event 
was anything but forgotten; the 
principles it revealed became the 
basis of a hugely successful business. 

How shall we regard the Zeritsky Brothers? As archvillains or 
pioneers? In support of the latter view, it must be admitted that 
the spirit of inquiry and the willingness to risk the unknown 
were indisputably theirs. However, their pioneering — if we agree 




 



to call it that — was, equally indisputably, bound up with the 
quest for a fast buck. 

Some of their first clients paid 
as high as $15,000 for the initial 
freezing, and the exorbitant rate 
of $1,000 per year as a storage 
charge. The Zeritsky Brothers 
owned and managed one of the 
largest quick-freezing plants in 
the world, and it was their claim 
that converting the freezing 
equipment and storage facilities 
to accommodate humans was extremely expensive, hence the high 
rates. 

When the early clients who 
paid these rates were defrosted 
years later, and found other clients receiving the same services 
for as little as $3,000, they threatened a row and the Zeritskys 
made substantial refunds. By that 
time they could easily afford it, 
and since any publicity about 
their enterprise was unwelcome 
to them, all refunds were made 
without a whimper. $3,000 became the standard rate, with $100 
per year the storage charge, and 
no charge for defrosting. 

The Zeritskys were businessmen, first and last. Anyone who 
had the fee could put himself 
away for whatever period of time 
he wished, and no questions 
asked. The ironclad rule that full 
payment must be made in advance was broken only once, as 
far as the records show. 



A certain young man had a 
very wealthy uncle, residing in 
Milwaukee, whose heir he was, 
but the uncle was not getting 
along in years fast enough. The 
young man, then 18 years old, 
did not wish to waste the "best 
years of his life" as a poor boy. 
He wanted the money while he 
was young, but his uncle was as 
healthy as he was wealthy. The 
Zeritskys were the obvious miswer 
to his problem. 

The agreement between them 
has been preserved. They undertook to service the youth without advance payment. They further undertook to watch the Milwaukee papers until the d< mise 
of the uncle should be reported, 
whereupon they would defrost 
the hoy. In exchange for this, 
the youth, thinking of course that 
money would be no object when 
he came out, agreed to pay 
double. 

The uncle lived 17 years longer, 
during which time he seems to 
have forgotten his nephew and 
to have become deeply interested 
in a mystic society, to which he 
left his entire fortune. The Zeritskys duly defrosted the boy. and 
whether they or he were the more 
disappointed is impossible to 
imagine. They never forgot the 
lessfld, and never made another 
exception to their rule* 

He, poor fellow, spent the rest 
of his life, including the best

years, paying off his debt which, 
at $3,000 plus 17 years at $100 
per year, and the whole doubled, 
amounted to $9,400. The books 
record his slow but regular payments over the next 43 years, and 
indicate that he had only $250 
left to pay when he died. We 
may, I think, assume that various 
underworld characters who were 
grateful ex-clients of the Zeritskys 
were instrumental in persuading 
the boy to keep up his payments. 

Criminals were the first to 
apply for quick-freezing, and 
formed the mainstay of the Zeritskys' business through the years. 
What more easy than to rob, hide 
the loot (except for that all-important advance payment), present yourself to the Zeritskys and 
remain in their admirable chambers for five or ten years, emerge 
to find the hue and cry long since 
died down and the crime forgotten, recover your haul and 
live out your life in luxury? 

Due to the shady character of 
most of their patrons, the Zeritskys kept all records by a system of numbers. Names never 
appeared on the books, and anonimity was guaranteed. 

Law enforcement agents, looking for fugitives from justice, 
found no way to break down this 
system, nor any law which they 
could interpret as making it illegal to quick-freeze. Perhaps the 
truth is that they did not search 



too diligently for a law that could 
be made to apply. As long as the 
Zeritskys kept things quiet and 
did not advertise or attract public 
attention, they could safely continue their bizarre business. 

City officials of Los Angeles, 
and particularly members of the 
police force, enjoyed a period of 
unparalleled prosperity. Lawyers 
and other experts who thought 
they were on the track of legal 
means by which to liquidate the 
Zeritsky empire found themselves 
suddenly able to buy a ranch or 
a yacht or both, and retire forever from the arduous task of 
earning a living. 

Even with a goodly part of 
the population of Los Angeles as 
permanent pensioners, the Zeritsky fortune grew to incredible 
proportions. By the time the 
Zeritsky Brothers died and left 
the business to their sons, it was 
a gold mine, and an inexhaustible 
one at that. 

During these later years, the 
enterprise began to attract a 
somewhat better class of people. 
Murderers and other criminals 
continued to furnish the bulk of 
the business, but as word of this 
amazing service seeped through 
the country, others began to see 
in it an easy way of solving their 
problems. They were encouraged, 
too, by the fact that the process 
was painless, and the firm completely reliable. There were no

risks, no accidents, no fatalities. 
One could, in short, have confidence in the Zeritskys. 

Soon after Monahan's great exposure rocked the nation, however, many of these better-type 
clients leaped into print to tell 
their experiences. 

One of the most poignant stories came from the daughter of 
a Zeritsky client. Her father was 
still, at the age of one hundred 
and two, passionately interested 
in politics, but the chances of 
his lasting until the next election 
were not good. The daughter herself suggested the deep freeze, 
and he welcomed the idea. He 
decided on a twenty year stay 
because, in his own words, "If 
the Republicans can't get into 
the White House in twenty years, 
1 give up." Upon his return, he 
found that his condition had not 
been fulfilled. His daughter described him. as utterly baffled by 
the new world. He lived in it 
just a week before he left it, 
this time for good. She states his 
last words were, "How do you 
people stand it?" 

Some professional people patronized the Zeritskys, chiefly 
movie stars. After the expose, fan 
magazines were filled with accounts of how the stars had kept 
youthful. The more zealous ones 
had prolonged their screen lives 
for years by the simple expedient 
of storing themselves away be


tween pictures. We may imagine 
the feelings of their public upon 
discovering that the seemingly 
eternal youth of their favorites 
was due to the Zeritskys and not, 
as they had been led to believe, 
to expensive creams, lotions, diet 
and exercise. There was a distinctly unfavorable reaction, and 
the letter columns of the fan magazines bristled with angry charges 
of cheating. 

But next to criminals, the majority of people who applied for 
quick-freezing seems to have been 
husbands or wives caught in insupportable marital situations. 
Their experiences were subsequently written up in the confession magazines. It was usually, 
the husband who fled to Los 
Angeles and incarcerated himself 
for an appropriate number of 
years, at the end of which time 
his unamiable spouse would have 
died or made other arrangements. 
If we can believe the magazines, 
this scheme worked out very well 
in most cases. 

There was, inevitably, one 
spiteful wife who divined her husband's intentions. By shrewd reasoning, she figured approximately 
the number of years he had 
chosen to be absent, and put herself away for a like period. In 
a TV dramatization rather pessimistically entitled You Can't 
Get Away, the husband described 
his sensations upon being de

frosted after 15 years, only to 
find his wife waiting for him, 
right there in the reception room 
of the Zeritsky plant. 

"She was as perfectly preserved 
as I was," he said. "Every irritating habit that had made my 
life unbearable with her was absolutely intact." 

The sins of the fathers may 
be visited on the sons, but how 
often we see repeated the old 
familiar pattern of the sons destroying the lifework of the fathers ! The Zeritsky Brothers were 
fanatically meticulous. They supervised every detail of their 
operations, and kept their records 
with an elaborate system of 
checks and doublechecks. They 
were shrewd enough to realize 
that complete dependability was 
essential to their business. A satisfied Zeritsky client was a silent 
client. One dissatisfied client 
would be enough to blow the 
business apart. 

The sons, in their greed, overexpanded to the point where they 
could not, even among the four 
of them, personally supervise 
each and every detail. A fatal 
mistake was bound to occur 
sooner or later. When it did, the 
victim broadcast his grievance to 
the world. 

The story appeared in a national magazine, every copy of 
which was sold an hour after it 
appeared on the stands. Under 



the title They Put the Freeze on 
Me! John A. Monahan told his 
tragic tale. At the age of 37, he 
had fallen desperately in love 
with a girl of 16. She was immature and frivolous and wanted to 
"play around" a little more before she settled down. 

"She told me," he wrote, "to 
come back in five years, and that 
started me thinking. In five years 
I'd be 42, and what would a girl 
of 21 want with a man twice as 
old as her?" 

John Monahan moved in circles where the work of the Zeritskys was well known. Not only 
did he see an opportunity of being 
still only 37 when his darling 
reached 21, but he foresaw a painless way of passing the years 
which he must endure without 
her. Accordingly, he presented 
himself for the deep-freeze, paid 
his $3,000 and the $500 storage 
charge in advance, and left, he 
claimed, "written instructions to 
let me out in five years, so there'd 
be no mistakes." 

Nobody knows how the slip 
happened, but somehow John A, 
Monahan, or rather the number 
assigned to him, was entered on 
the books for 25 years instead of 
five years. Upon being defrosted, 
and discovering that a quarter of 
a century had elapsed, his rage 
was awesome. Along with everything else, his love for his 
sweetheart had been perfectly 




 



preserved, but she had given up 
waiting for him and was a happy 
mother of two boys and six girls. 

Monahan's accusation that the 
Zeritskys had "ruined his life" 
may be taken with a grain of 
salt. He was still a young man, 
and the rumor that he received 
a hundred thousand for the magazine rights to his story was true. 

As most readers are aware, 
what has come to be known as 
"Zeritsky's Law" was passed by 
Congress and signed by the President three days after Monahan's 
story broke. 

Seventy -five years after Mrs. 
Graham's cat fell into the freezer, 
it became the law of the land 
that the mandatory penalty for 
anyone applying quick-freezing 
methods to any living thing, human or animal, Was death. Also, 
all quick-frozen people were to 



be defrosted immediately. 

Los Angeles papers reported 
that beginning on the day Monahan's story appeared, men by the 
thousands poured into the city. 
They continued to come, choking 
every available means of transport, for the next two days — until, 
that is, Zeritsky's Law went 
through. 

When we consider the date, and 
remember that due to the gravity 
of the international situation, a 
bill had just been passed drafting 
all men from 16 to 60, we realize 
why Congress had to act. 

The Zeritskys, of course, were 
among the first to be taken. Because of their experience, they 
were put in charge of a military 
warehouse for dehydrated foods, 
and warned not to get any ideas 
for a new business.
