ODD JOHN 

BY OlAF STAPLEDON 

Many authors have tried to write the story of Homo 
Superior and have failed— It's like Pithecanthropus describing 
Modern Man, an obviously overwhelming task. But Stapledon 
succeeded! This is THE masterpiece of the super-race that 
may some day replace Homo Sapiens! Compellingly convincing, ODD JOHN is truly a great work of science fiction! 



Step Outside 



I AST month, one of the questions raised was whether a 
^ science fiction magazine 
can afford to have a viewpoint, 
and, if so, if it can impose the 
viewpoint on its stories. 

An editor has his own opinions 
and convictions, of course, many 
of which are outraged by stories 
submitted to him. Should he take 
only those that agree with his 
opinions? 

What makes this important is 
the occasional anguished or angry 
letter revealing that that particular reader has had his mental 
corns stepped on. Avoiding offense would be a cinch — simply 
pick stories that say nothing at 
all. Enough come in every month', 
devoid of everything but witless 
action or trivial surprise, to fill a 
dozen issues. 

But is that the purpose of 
science fiction? Perhaps we need 
a definition of purpose. 

The first goal, naturally, is entertainment, a word, by the way, 
that makes rubber seem inflexible 
by contrast. It ranges all the vast 
distance from staring through 
keyholes to staring through telescopes, from racetracks to treatises, scatology to seismography. 



In science fiction, the range is 
just as enormous. It goes from a 
scant step above the comics to a 
scant step below textbooks. The 
widest audience is between these 
two extremes, and that is where 
GALAXY stands. It strives for 
interesting ideas, characters, conflict, situations, backgrounds, and 
these are the ingredients of entertainment for all but the most specialized repetitive satisfactions, 
such as rest room artistry, crossword puzzlement, and higher 
math addiction. 

What science fiction must present entertainingly is speculation. 
Not prophecy, but fictional surmises based on present factors, 
scientific, social, political, cultural, or whatever. When a story hits 
a future development on the head, 
it should be considered a minor 
accident: its main job was not to 
predict, but to conjecture what 
might happen if certain circumstances followed certain lines of 
development. 

Take the case of television. Anticipating it in 1900 was a technological feat — and that was exactly how it was presented, a sideshow wonder to awe those who 
read of it. But we who live with 



2 




 



TV's Uncle Miltie, nightly murder, the resurrected cadaver of 
vaudeville, frighteningly stupid 
and stupidly frightening "kiddie" 
shows, the idiot quizzes and amateur hours, know that the impact 
is overwhelmingly social and cultural, rather than technological. 

Any science fiction writer can 
and does predict gadgets and obvious trends by the score. But the 
gadgets and trends alone mean 
nothing. Enough authors have described World War III so completely that it will be somewhat 
of an anti-climax if it ever does 
come. And interplanetary flight, 
time travel, extraterrestrial invasion, and all the other basic situations in science fiction. 

Will these worlds ever exist? 
They may. or may not; it doesn't 
matter. The possibility is what 
counts in science fiction, not the 
certainty. 

Now the question is whether 
writer, editor and reader must be 
in favor of these possible developments. Again, it doesn't matter. 
If the writer who predicted television in 1900 could have foreseen 
its dismaying results, he should 
still have had to describe them 
dramatically, and the more objectivity he could attain, the better. 

Coming Attraction by Fritz 
Leiber is such a case. It told with 
shocking realism the moral collapse that might occur as a result 



of brutalizing warfare. Did Leiber 
favor it? Did I? Did the thou* 
sands of readers who admired it, 
the editors of anthologies who 
fought to reprint it first, the authors who almost bitterly envied 
its stunning craftsmanship? Of 
course not, any more than the 
prediction of the effects of TV 
would have had to involve the 
author's approval. Yet several 
readers attacked the story on exactly that basis, though history 
records similar moral breakdowns after other wars. 

The Fireman by Ray Bradbury, Dark Interlude by Fredric 
Brown and Mack Reynolds, To 
Serve Man by Damon Knight, 
Common Denominator by John 
D. MacDonald, and several other 
GALAXY stories were interpreted 
by some'readers as in one way or 
another approving possible trends 
that might not prove pleasant if 
they ever occurred. 

But the writers are not saying 
that these extrapolations are anything more than possibilities. 
They are examining prospects, 
pleasant and unpleasant alike, 
and that, if it produces good 
stories, is the legitimate province 
of science fiction. 

I think moralizing should be 
left to ministers, while commentators and astrologers keep their 
claim to 20/20 foresightAnyone disagree?

STEP OUTSIDE 



^ 




Roof less and footloose, a man 
in space can't help but dream 
of coming home. But something 
nobody should do is bet on the 
validity of a homesick dream! 



FLIGHT Officer Robert 
Craig surrendered the tube 
containing his service record tapes and stood waiting while 
the bored process clerk examined 
the seal. 

"Your clearance," said the 
clerk. 

Craig handed him a battered 
punch card and watched the man 
insert it in the reproducer. He 
felt anxiety as the much-handled 
card refused for a time to match 
the instrument's metal contact 
points. The line of men behind 
Craig fidgeted. 

"You got to get this punched 
by Territorial," said the clerk. 
"Take it back to your unit's 
clearance office." 

"Look again. Sergeant," Craig 
said, repressing his irritation. 

"It ain't notched." 

"The hell it isn't." 

The man examined the card 
with squinting care and nodded 
finally. "It's so damn notched/' 
he complained. "You ought to 



SEA LEGS 



take care of that card; can't get 
on without one" 

Craig hesitated before moving. 
"Next," said the clerk. "What 
you waiting for?" 

"Don't I take my 201 hie?" 
"We send it on ahead. Go to 
Grav 1 desk." 

A murmur greeted the order. 
Craig experienced the thrill of 
knowing the envy of the others. 
Grav 1 — that meant Terra. He 
crossed the long, dreary room, 
knowing the eyes of the other 
men were upon him. 

"Your service tapes," the next 
noncom said. "Where you going?"' 
"Grav 1 — Terra" fumbled 
Craig. "Los Angeles." 

"Los Angeles, eh? Where in Los 
Angeles?" ■ . 

i "I — X — M Craig muttered, fumbling in his pockets. 

"No specific destination," supplied the man as he punched a 
key on a small instrument. "AirJock ahead and to your right 
Strip and follow the robot's orders. Any metal?" 

"Metal?" asked Craig. 
"You know, metal." 
"Well, my identification key." 
"Here," commanded the clerk, 
extending a plastic envelope. 

Craig moved in the direction 
indicated. He fought the irrational fear that he had missed 
an important step in the complicated clerical process. He 
cursed the grudging attitude of 



the headquarters satellite personnel and felt the impotence of 
a spaceman who had long forgotten the bureaucracy of a rear 
area base. The knowledge that 
much of it was moti va ted by 
envy soothed him as he clumsily 
let himself into the lock. 

"Place your clothing in the receptacle provided and assume a 
stationary position on the raised 
podium in the center of the lock." 

Cratg obeyed the robot voice 
and began reluctantly to remove 
his flight jacket. Its incredibly 
fine-grained leather would carry, 
none of the strange, foreign associations for the base station clerk 
who , would appropriate it. He 
would never know the beautiful, 
gentle beast that supplied this 
skin. 

"You are retarding the progress 
of others. Please respond more 
quickly to your orders." 

Craig quickly removed the last 
of his clothing. It was impossible 
to hate a robot, but one could 
certainly hate those who set it 
into operation. 

"You will find a red button at 
your feet. Lower your head and 
depress that button." 

Stepping on the button with 
his bare foot produced an instant 
of brilliant blue illumination. A 
small scratch on his arm stung 
briefly and he was somewhat 
blinded by the flash even through 
his eyelids, but that was all there 



i 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was to the sterilizing process. 

"Your clothing and effects will 
be in the dressing room immediately beyond the locked door." 

He found his clothing cleanly 
and neatly hung on plastic 
h«ngers just inside the door to 
the dressing room. The few personal items he carried in his 
pockets were still there. The 
Schtaan flight jacket was actually 
there, looking like new, its spaceblue uniaded and as wonderfully 
pliant as before. 

"Insert your right arm into the 
instrument on the central table," 
commanded the same voice he 
had heard before. "Turn your 
aim until the scratch is in contact with the metal plate. There 
will be a slight pain, but it is 
necessary to treat the small injury 
you have been disregarding." 

Craig obeyed and clenched his 
teeth against a sharp stinging. 
His respect for the robot-controlled equipment of bases had 
risen. When he withdrew his arm, 
the scratch was neatly coated 
with a layer of flesh-colored plastic material. 

He dressed quickly and was on 
the verge of asking the robot for 
instructions, when a man appeared in the open doorway. 

"I am Captain Wyandotte," 
said the man in a pleasant voice. 

"Well, what*s next?" asked 
Craig somewhat more belligerently than he had intended. 



The man smiled. "Your reaction is quite natural. You are 
somewhat aggressive after Clerical, eh?" 

"I'm a little anxious to get 
home, I suppose," said Craig defensively. 

"By 'home' you mean Terra. 
But you've never been there, have 
you?" 

"No, but my father — " 

"Your parents left Terra during the Second Colonization of 
Cassiopeia II, didn't they?** 

"Yes," Craig said. He was uncomfortable; Wyandotte seemed 
to know all about him. 

"We might say you've been 
away ejuite a while, eh?" 

"I was entered as a spaceman 
when 1 was 16." Craig said. "I've 
never been down for any period 
as yet." 

"You mean you haven't been 
in a gravity system?** 

"Oh, I've landed a few limes, 
even walked around for m 
while . . .*' 

"With the help of paraoxylnebutal," supplied the captain. 

"Well, sure." 

"Mr. Craig, I suppose you've 
guessed that the next step in our 
little torture system here ia 
psych." 

"So I gathered.** 

The captain laughed reassuringly. "No, don't put up your 
guard again. The worst is over. 
Short of Gravitational condition


SEA LEGS 



ing, there is nothing to stop you 
from going to Terra." 

"Sorry, I guess I'm a little 
touchy. This is my -first time . . *"Quite natural. But it being 
your first time — in quite a number of ways, I might add — it will 
be necessary for you to undergo 
some conditioning." 

"Conditioning?" asked Craig. 
"Yes. You have spent eleven 
years in space. Your body is conditioned to a normal state of free 
fall, or at best to a state of 
acceleration.*' 

"Yeah, I know. Once on Gerymeade . . ." 

"You were ill, couldn't keep 
your balance, felt dizzy. That is 
why all spacemen carry PON", 
paraoxylnebutal, with them. It 
helps suppress certain physiological reactions to an entirely new 
set of conditions. Channels of 
the ear, for example. They play 
an important part in our awareness of balance. They operate on 
a simple gravity principle. Without gravity they act up for a 
time, then gradually lose function. Returning to gravity is 
rather frightening at first." 

"I know all about this, Captain." 

"You've undoubtedly read 
popularizations in tapezines. But 
you have experienced it briefly." 

"I expect to have some trouble 
at first." Craig was disturbed by 
the wordy psychologist. What was 



the man actually saying? 

"Do you know what sailors of 
ancient times meant by 'sea 
legs?' ? asked Wyandotte. "Men 
on a rolling ocean acclimated 
themselves to a rolling horizontal. 
They had trouble when they went 
ashore and the horizontal didn't 
roll any more." 

"It meant more than that. 
There were excellent psychological reasons for the old stereotype, the 'drunken sailor.' A port 
city was a frightening thing to 
an old sailor^ — but let's begin our 
little job at the beginning. I'll 
turn you over to psychometry for 
the usual tests and pick you up 
tomorrow morning at, say, 0900." 

TOURING the days that fol-L' lowed, the psychologist 
seemed to Craig to become progressively more didactic. He 
would deliver long speeches about 
the "freedom of open space." He 
spoke repetitiously of the "growing complexity of Terran society." And yet the man could not 
be pinned down to any specific 
condition the spaceman would 
find intolerable. 

Craig began to hate the delay 
that kept him from Terra. 
Through the ports of the headquarters base satellite, he scanned 
the constellations for the scores 
of worlds he had visited during 
his eleven years in space. They 
were incredibly varied, even those 



* 




 



that supported life. He had 
weathered difficult landings on 
worlds with rip-tide gravities, had 
felt the pull of the incredible 
star-tides imparted by twin and 
even triple star systems. He had 
been on Einstein IV, the planet 
of eight moons, and had felt the 
pulse of all eight of the satellites 
at once that no pon could completely nullify. 

But even if he could accept 
the psychologist's authority for 
the cumulative effect of a gravity 
system, he could not understand 
the unspoken warning he felt underlying all that the man said. 

"Of course it has changed," 
Craig was protesting. "Anyway, 
I never really knew very much 
about Terra. So what? I know 
it won't be as it was in tapezines 
either." 

"Yet you are completely sure 
you will want to live out your life 
there, that you are willing to give 
up space service for it." 

"We've gone through this time 
and time again," Craig said wearily. "I gave you my reasons 
for quitting space. We analyzed 
them. You agreed that you could 
not decide that for me and that 
my decision is logical. You tell 
me spacemen don't settle down 
on Terra. Yet you won't — or can't 
■ — tell me why. I've got a damned 
good job there — " 

"You may find that 'damned 
good jobs* become boring." 



"So I'll transfer. I don't know 
what you're trying to get at. Captain, but you're not talking me 
out of going back. If the service 
needs men so badly, let them get 
somebody else. I've put in my 
time." 

"Do you really think that's my 
reason?" 

"Sure. What else can it be?" 

"Mr. Craig," the psychologist 
said slowly, "you have my authorization for you to return to 
Terra as a private citizen of that 
planet. You will be given a very 
liberal supply of pon — which you 
will definitely need. Good luck. 
You'll need that too." 

^"\N the eighth day, two attendants, who showed the effects 
of massive doses of pon to protect themselves from the centrifugal force, had to carry a man 
out of the tank. Many others 
asked to be removed, begged to 
be allowed to withdraw thrir 
resignations. 

"The twelfth day is the worst," 
a grizzled spaceman told Craig. 
"That's when the best of 'em 
want out." 

Craig clenched the iron rung 
©f his bed and struggled to bring 
the old man's face into focus. 

"How . . . how do they know 
when you ought ... -to come 
out?" he asked between waves 
of nausea. 

"Blood pressure. They get you 



SEA LEGS 



* 



just before you go iato shock." 

"How can they tell ?" Craig 
fought down his growing panic. 
**I can't." 

"That strap around your belly. 
You mean you ain't noticed it?" 

"Haven't noticed much of anything." 

"Well, it's keyed to give them 
some kind of signal." 

The old man lapsed into silence. Craig wished him to continue. He desperately wanted 
something to distract his mind 
from the ghastly conditioning 
process. 

Slowly at first, the lines formed 
by seams in the metal ceiling 
began to bend. Here it came 
again! 

"Old man!" shouted Craig. 

"Yeah, son. They've dropped 
it down a notch." 

"Dropped . . . it . . . down?" 

"Maybe that ain't scientific, 
but it's the way I always think 
of it." 

"Can't they . . . drop it down 
continuously?" 

"They tried that a few times 
— once when I was aboard. 
You wouldn't like it, kid. You 
wouldn't like it at all." 

"How . . . many times . . . do 
they drop it?" 

"Four times during the day, 
three at night. Twenty days." 

A nightmare of visual sensations ebbed into Craig's mind. He 
was vaguely aware of the moans 



of other men In the vaultlike 
room. Wave upon wave of nausea 
swept him as he watched the seam 
lines bend and warp fantastically. 
He snapped his eyelids shut, only 
to begin feeling the nightmarish 
bodily sensations once more. He 
felt the cot slowly rise longitudinally, felt himself upside down, 
then the snap of turning right 
side up once more — and he knew 
that neither he nor the cot had 
moved so much as an inch. 

Craig heard the voices around 
him, muffled, as though talking 
through wadding. 
". . . got it bad." 
"We better take him out.*' 
*'. . . pretty bad." 
"He'll go into shock." 
"... never make it the twelfth.** 
"We better yank him." 
"I'm ... all right," Craig mumbled at the voices. He struggled 
with the bonds of his cot. With 
terrible effort he forced his eyes 
open. Two white-clad figures, 
ridiculously out of proportion, 
hovered wraithlike over him. 
Four elongated eyes peered at 
him. 

Attendants coming for to take 
me home . . . 

"Touch me and I'll kick your 
teeth in!" he yelled. "I'm going 
to Terra. Wish you weTe going 
to Terra?" 

Then it was better. Oddly, he 
passed the twelfth day easily. 
By the fourteenth day, Craig 




 



knew he could stand Grav r. 
The whine of the centrifuge's 
motors had diminished to a low 
hum. Either that or they had 
begun to produce ultra-sonic 
waves. Craig was not sure. 

Most of the men had passed 
through the torments of gravitational conditioning. The huge 
headquarters base centrifuge 
aboard the man-made satellite 
had gradually caused their bodies 
to respond once more to a single 
source of pull. They were now 
ready to become inhabitants of 
planets again, instead of freefalling ships. 

On the eighteenth day, automatic machinery freed them 
from their imprisoning cots. 
Clumsily and awkwardly at first, 
the men began to walk, to hold 
their heads and arms in proper 
attitudes. They laughed and 
joked about it and kidded those 
who were slow at adjusting. Then 
they again began taking paraoxylnebutal in preparation for the 
free-fall flight to Terra. 

Only one of the score of men 
in the centrifuge tank remained 
voluntarily in his cot. 

"Space article violator," the 
old man informed Craig. "Psycho, 
I think. Went amuck with some 
extraterritorials. Killed a dozen." 

"What will they do, exile him?" 

"Not to Chociante, if that's 
what you mean. They just jerked 
his space card and gave him a 



one-way ticket to Terra.** 

"For twelve murders?" asked 
Craig incredulously. 

"That's enough, son." The old 
man eyed Craig for an instant 
before looking away. "Pick something to talk about. What do you 
figure on doing when you get 
to Terra, for instance?" 

"I'm going into Import. My father was in it for twenty years." 

"Sure," said the old spaceman, 
watching a group of young crewmen engaged in an animated conversation. 

"It's a good job. There's a future to it." 

"Yeah." 

Why did he have to explain 
anything at all to the old space 
tramp? 

"Once I get set up, I'll probably try to open my own business." 

"And spend your weekends on 
Luna." 

Craig half rose from his cot, 
jarred into anger. 

But the old spaceman turned, 
smiling wryly. "Don't get hot, 
kid. I guess I spent too long in 
Zone V." He paused to examine 
his wrinkled hands. They were 
indelibly marked with lever callouses. "You get to thinking anyone who stays closer'n eighty 
light years from Terra is a landlubber." 

Craig relaxed, realizing he had 
acted childishly, "Used to think 



SEA LEGS 



11 



the same. Then I took the exam 
and got this job." r 

"Whereabouts?" 

"Los Angeles." 

The old man looked up at 
Craig. "You don't know much 
about Terra, do you, son?" 

"Not much." 

"Yeah. Well, I hope you ain't 
disappointed." 

" My father was born there, 
but I never saw it. Never hit the 
Solar System, matter of fact. 
Never saw much of anything close 
up. I stood it a lortg time, old 
man, this hitting atmospheres all 
over the Universe." 

But the spaceman seemed to 
have lost interest. He was unpacking some personal belongings from a kit. 

"What are you doing in Grav 
1?" Craig asked. 

The old man's face clouded for 
an instant. "In the old days, they 
used to say us old-timers acted 
like clocks. They used to say we 
just ran down. Now they got 
some fancy psychology name for 
it." 

Craig regretted his question. He 
would have muttered some word 
of apology, but the old man continued. 

"Maybe you've read some of 
the old sea stories, or more'n 
likely had 'em read to you. Sailors could go to sea until they just 
sort of dried up. The sea tanned 
. their skins and stiffened their 



bones, but it never stiffened their 
hearts. When they got old, it just 
pulled them in. 

"But space is different. Space 
is raw and new. It tugs at your 
guts. It sends the blood rushing 
through your veins. It's like loving. You don't become a part of 
space the way you do the old 
sea, though. It leaves you strictly 
alone. Except that it sucks you 
dry, takes all the soup out of 
you, leaves you brittle and old — 
old as a dehydrated piece of split 
leather. 

"Then one day it shoots a spurt 
of blood around in one of your 
old veins. Something gives. Space 
is through with you then. And 
if you can stand this whirligig 
conditioning", you're through with 
space." 

"yOU can't figure it. Some of 
J- 'em urp all over and turn six 
shades of green." 

"You got to watch the ones 
that don't.** 

"Yeah, you got to watch the 
ones that don't. Especially th& 
old ones." 

"He's old. You think it was hia 
heart?" 

"Who knows? 1 * 

"They'll dump turn, worCi 
they?" 

"After a tracer is sent through. 
But it won't do any good." 

"He probably outlived everybody that ever knew him.'*

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOA 



"Wouldn't be surprised. Here, 
grab his leg." 

ROBERT Craig folded the 
flight jacket tightly and 
stuffed it into the cylindrical carton. A sleeve unwound just as he 
did so, making it difficult to fit 
into the place he had made for 
it. Exasperated, he refolded it and 
jammed it in place. Smaller rolls 
of underclothing were then fitted 
in. When he was satisfied with 
the layer, he tossed in a small 
handful of crystals and began to 
fill the next layer. After the carton was completely filled, he 
ignited the sealing strip and 
watched as the plastic melted 
into a single, seamless whole. It 
was ready for irradiation. Probably in another ten years his 
son-to-be would put it on and 
play spaceman. But Craig swore 
he'd make sure that the kid 
knew what a stinking life it was. 

At 1 300 hours, the ferry 
bumped heavily alongside the 
starboard lock. It was the signal 
for relief in the passengers' quarters ; many were beginning to feel 
a reaction to the short free-fall 
flight from the headquarters satellite. 

The audio called out: "Flight 
Officer Robert Craig. Flight Officer Robert Craig. Report to Orderly 12. Report to Orderly 12 
through the aft door.** 

With pangs of anxiety he could 



not completely suppress, Craig 
obeyed. 

Orderly 12 handed him a message container. 

"Who's it from? Somebody on 
Terra?" 

"From a private spaceman 
named Morgan Brockman." 
"Brockman?" 

"He was with you in the grav 
tank." 

"The old man!" 

The message container produced a battered punch card. 
Craig straightened it and was 
about to reach into his pocket 
for a hand transcriber. But then 
he noticed the card bore only a 
few irregular punches and was 
covered with rough hand printing. 

Son, when the flunkies get around 
to giving you this, they'll have shot 
me out the tube. How do I know? 
Same way you know when your turbos 
are going to throw a blade. It's good 
this way. 

.There's something you can do for 
me if you want to. Way back, some 
fifty years ago, there was a woman. 
She was my wife. It's a long story I 
won't bother you with. Anyway, I left 
her. Wanted to take her along with 
me, but she wouldn't go. 

Earth was a lot different then than 
it ia now. They don't have to tell me; 
I know. I saw it coming and so did 
Ethel. We talked about it and I knew 
I had to go. She wouldn't or couldn't 
go. Wanted me to stay, but I couldn't. 

I tried to send her some units once 
in a while. Don't know if she ever got 
them. Sometimes I forgot to send them 
at all. You know, you're way out across 
the Galaxy, while she's home. 

Go see her if you can, son. Will you? 
Make sure she gets the unit transfer

I made out. It isn't much out of seventy 
years of living, but she may need it. 
And maybe you can tell her a little 
bit about what it means to be out 
there. Tell her it's open and free and 
when you got hold of those levers and 
you're trying for an orbit on something 
big and new and green . . . Hell, you 
remember. You know how to tell her. 

Her name is Ethel Brockman. I know 
she'll still use my name. Her address 
is or was East 71, North 101, Number 
4. You can trace her easy if she moved. 
Women don't generally shove off and 
not leave a forwarding address. Not 
Ethel, at least. 

Craig put the battered card in 
his pocket and walked back 
through the door to the passenger 
room. How did you explain to 
an old woman why her husband 
deserted her fifty years before? 
Some kind of story about one's 
duty to the Universe? No, the 
old man had not been in Intergalactic. He had been a tramp 
spaceman. Well, why had he left? 

Fifty years in space. Fifty 
years! Zone V had been beyond 
anybody's imagination that long 
ago. He must have been in. on 
the first Cetusian flights and shot 
the early landings in Cetus II. 
God only knew how many times 
he had battled Zone 111b pirates . . . 

Damn the old man! How did 
one explain? 

CRAIG descended the ramp 
from the huge jet and concentrated on his impressions. One 
day he would recall this moment, 

14 i 



his first on the planet Terra. He 
tried to recall his first thrill at 
seeing Los Angeles, 1500 square 
miles of it, from the ship as it 
entered the atmosphere. 

He was about to step off the 
last step when a man appeared 
hurriedly. A rather plump man, 
he displayed a toothy smile on 
his puffy red face. 

"A moment, sir. Just a little 
greeting from the Terra. You 
understand, . of course. Purely 
routine." 

Craig remained on the final 
step of the ramp, puzzled. The 
man turned to a companion at 
his right. 

"We can see that this gentleman has come from a long, long 
way off, can't we?" 

The other man did not look 
up. He was peering into what 
seemed to Craig to be a kind of 
camera. 

"We can allow the gentlemen 
to continue now, can't we? It 
wasn't that we believed for a 
minute, you understand . . • 
purely routine." 

Both men were gone in an 
instant, leaving Craig completely 
bewildered. 

"You goin' to move on, buddy, 
or you want to go back?" 

Craig turned to face a line of 
his fellow passengers up the ramp 
behind him. 

"Who was that?" Craig asked 

"Customs. Bet you never got 

iALAXY SCIENCE F I C T I O 14 



such a smooth screening before, 
eh?" 

"You mean he screened me? 
What Tor?" 

"Hard to say," the other passenger said. "You'll get used to 
this. They get it over with quick." 

Craig made his way toward 
the spaceport administration 
building. His first physical contact with Terra had passed unnoticed. 

"Sir! Sir!" cried a voice behind 
him. 

He wheeled to see a man walking briskly toward him. 

"You dropped this, sir. Quite 
by accident, of course." 

Craig examined the small object the man had given him before rushing oft' toward an exit. 

It was an empty pon tube he 
had just discarded. He couldn't 
understand why the man had 
bothered until he realized that 
the plastaloid floor of the lobby 
displayed not the faintest scrap 
of paper nor trace of dirt. 

HPHE Import personnel man 
was toying with a small chip 
of gleaming metal. He did not 
look directly at Craig for more 
than an instant at a time, and 
commented on Craig's description 
of his trip through the city only 
very briefly between questions. 

"It's a good deal bigger than 
I imagined," Craig was saying. 
"Haven't seen much of it, of 



course. Thought I'd check in here 
with you first." 

"Yes, naturally." 

"Thought you could give me 
some idea of conditions . . ." 

"Conditions?" 

"For instance, what part of the 
city I should live in. That is, 
what part is closest to where I'll 
work." 

"I see," said the man noncommittally. It seemed to Craig that 
he was about to add something. 
He did not, however, but instead 
rose from his chair and walked 
to the large window overlooking 
an enormous section of the city 
far below. He stared out the window for a time, leaving Craig 
seated uncomfortably in the silent 
room. There was a distracted 
quality about him. Craig thought. 

"You are the first man we have 
had from the Intergalactic Service," the personnel man said 
finally. 

"That so?" 

"Yes." He turned to face Craig 
briefly before continuing. "You 
must find it very strange here." 

"Well, I've never seen a city 
so big." 

"Yes, so big. And also . . ." He 
seemed to consider many words 
before completing the sentence. 
"And also different." 

"I haven't been here very long," 
said Craig. "Matter of fact, I 
haven't been anywhere very long. 
This is my first real experience 



SEA LEGS

with life on a planet. As an adult, 
anyway." 

The personnel man seated himself once more and pressed a button on a small instrument. A 
secretary entered the office from 
a door to Craig's left. 

"Miss Wendel, this is Mr. 
Craig. Mr. Craig, my secretary. 
Mr. Craig will enter Minerals and 
Metals, Zone V." 

They exchanged formal greetings. She was a moderately pretty 
girl of medium height and, to 
Craig, a pleasantly rounded figure. He would have attempted to 
catch her eye had she not immediately occupied herself with 
unfolding the legs of a small instrument she was carrying. 

"This is Mr. Craig's first landing on Terra, Miss Wendel," the 
personnel man continued. "Actually, we shall have to consider 
him in much the same way we 
would an extraterrestrial." 

The girl glanced at Craig, casting him a cool, impersonal smile. 

"He was formerly a flight officer in the Intergalactic Space 
Service." The statement was delivered in an almost exaggeratedly 
casual tone. 

The giii glanced at him once 
more, this time with a definite 
quizzical look in her brown eyes. 

"Three complete tours of duty, 
1 believe." 

"Four," corrected Craig. "Four 
tours of three years each, minus 



a year's terminal leave." 

"I take it you have no identification card?" the man asked. 

"The one I held in the service. 
It's pretty comprehensive." 

The other turned to the secretary. "You'll see that he is assisted in filing his application, 
won't you? A provisional Code II. 
That will enable you to enter all 
Import offices freely, Mr. Craig." 

"Will he need a food and — 
clothing ration also?" asked the 
girl, without looking at Craig. 

"Yes." The man laughed. 
"You'll excuse us, Mr. Craig. We 
realize that you couldn't be expected to be familiar with Terra's fashions. In your present outfit you would certainly be typed 
as a , . . well, you'd be made 
uncomfortable." 

Craig reddened in spite of himself. He had bought the suit on 
Ghandii. 

"A hick," he supplied. 
"I wouldn't go that far, but 
some people might." 

CRAIG noted the pleasant way 
the girl filled her trim, rather 
severe business suit. He amused 
himself by calculating stress patterns in its plain woven material 
as she assembled the forms for 
him. 

"Here, Mr. Craig. I believe 
these are complete." 

"They look pretty complicated."

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIC7I 



"Not at all. The questions are 
quite explicit." 

Craig looked them over quickly. 

"I guess so. Say, Miss Wendel, 
I was wondering — I don't know 
the city at all. Maybe you could 
go with me to have dinner. It 
must be almost dinnertime now. 
You could sort of check me out 
on some . . 

"I'm afraid that would be quite 
impossible. You couldn't gain admittance to any office you need 
to visit tonight. Therefore, it is 
impossible for me to be of any 
assistance to you." 

"Oh, come now, Miss Wendel. 
There are women aboard spaceships. I'm not a starved wolf.*' 

"Certainly you are not, Mr. 
Craig. But it is not possible for 
me . . 

"You said that already, but 
you can have dinner with me. 
Just company." 

"I'm afraid I don't understand." 

THE Galactic hotel strove to 
preserve an archaic tone of 
hospitality. It advertised "a 
night's lodgings" and it possessed 
a bellboy. The bellboy actually 
carried Craig's plasticarton and 
large file of punch cards and 
forms to his room. Tired from the 
long, confusing day, Craig was 
not impressed. He vaguely wondered if the little drama of the 



hotel carried so far as a small 
fee to be paid the bellboy, and 
he hoped he would have the right 
size of Terran units in his wallet. 

Outside the door to the room, 
the bellboy stopped and turned 
to Craig. 

"For five I'll tell you where it 
is," he said in a subdued tone. 

"Tell me where what is?" 

"You know, the mike." 

"Mike?" 

"All right, mister, three units, 
then. I wasn't trying to hold you 
up." 

"You mean a microphone?** 
asked Craig, mechanically fishing for his wallet. 

"Sure, they don't put in screens 
here. Wanted to, but the boss 
convinced 'em there aren't any 
Freedomites ever stay here." 

"Where is the microphone?" 
Craig asked as he found a ten 
unit note. He was too puzzled 
to wonder what he was expected 
to do with the information. 

"It's in the bed illuminator. 
You can short it out with a razor 
blade. Or I'll do it for another 
two." 

"Never mind," Craig said wearily. He waited while the bellboy 
inserted a key into the door and 
opened it for him. 

"I can get you a sensatia-tape,'* 
whispered the boy when they had 
entered. He nudged Craig wickedly. "You know what they're 
like?'*

"Yeah," Craig said disgustedly. 
Traffic in the illicit mental-image 
tapes was known as far into space 
as lonely men had penetrated. 
Intergalactic considered them as 
great a menace to mental and 
moral stability as the hectopiates. 
Craig wearily got the man out of 
the room, took a PON pill, and 
eased himself into the bed. 

It had been a weird day and 
he had not liked it. There was no 
telling how long it would .take 
him to shake his — sea legs, the 
psychologist had called it. One 
thing was sure : Terra aggressively went a f ter its strangers. 

USHERED into the room by a 
sullen and silent secretory, 
Craig found himself facing a 
semi-circulor table at which were 
seated five uniformed men. The 
center man, obviously their superior, rose to greet him. He wore 
the familiar smile Craig had come 
to know so well and hate so 
much. The man was somewhat 
over forty years old, short, stout, 
entirely unpleasant and puffy. 

"Mr. Craig, I believe," he 
greeted Craig. Since it seemed to 
be more of a statement than a 
question, Craig did not answer. 
He took up a position of- more 
or less military attention at the 
center of the curved table. 

"You are Robert Craig,'* insisted the man. 

"Yes, I'm Robert Craig," he 



answered, somewhat surprised. 

The stout man seated himself 
with a sigh and began to sort 
through some papers on the table 
before him. The other four men 
continued to stare at Craig silently, until he began to feel uncomfortable and hostile. He 
stiffened his position of attention 
defiantly. 

"You may relax, Mr. Craig." 
said the first man without looking 
up. "You aren't nervous, are 
you?" 

"No," Craig said, trying to 
smile. "This is the first time I've 
been here and . ." He let the 
sentence trail off, hoping for a 
sympathetic response. But he did 
not get it. 

"Flight Officer, eh?" said the 
man. Then, looking up, he added, 
"Somewhat unusual to find a 
vigorous young man like yourself 
abandoning the space service for 
a Terran job, isn't it?" 
"I don't know. Is it?" 
"Leaving something behind out 
there, Mr. Craig?" 

"No, nothing," Craig snapped. 
The other man glared at him 
a full minute. Craig met the stare 
and realized the considerable 
power behind the weak face. 

"You don't like this sort of 
affair, do you, Mr. Craig?" 

Craig was forced to look away. 
"I'm afraid I don't see the necessity," he answered in a controlled 
voice. "I serve-d the Intergalactic

GALAXY SCIENCf FICTIOM 



Service well. My records prove 
that." 

"Granted," said his questioner 
bluntly. "You are a Terran, are 
you not, Mr. Craig?" 

"I should think that would be 
obvious," Craig said, matching 
the blunt tone. 

The man rapped the table. 
"That's enough of your impertinence! You may very well have 
served the Intergalactic Service, 
but you are on. Terra now. Terra, 
greatest, first of all civilized systems. Intergalactic may very well 
have to piddle with incompetent 
savages and wild colonists, but 
we of Terra assert our supremacy. 
Remember those words. You may 
not always find Terra so submissive to Intergalactic as Intergalactic would desire." 

''Where are your loyalties, Mr. 
C rai g ?" demanded one of tH e 
other men suddenly. . 

"I am a Terran . . .** 

"But your first loyalty is to 
Intergalactic. Is that right?" 

"Is there a distinction?" Craig 
shot back, thoroughly angry. 

"Do you wish to be held in 
contempt of this committee?" 
asked the first matt, leaning forward half out of his chair. 

"Of course not." 

"Then you will confine your 
responses to simple yes and ho 
answers, if you please, Mr. 
Craig." 

Craig glared at the men in im


potent rage. His head was beginning to ache. He had been many 
hours without paraoxylnebutal. 

"Now, Mr. Craig." the first 
man began in an overly mild 
tone, "we shall begin again. Please 
try to restrain your show of emotion. You are here in petition of 
an identity card of provisional 
Code II type. You maintain that 
you have never been on Terra 
before. Indeed, you state that you 
have never had a political affiliation." 

"Yes." 

"What are your reactions to the 
latest acts of the Liberty party?" 
a third man abruptly asked. 

"I have none," Craig answered, 
after an instant of confusion. 

"You do not condemn the Liberty party?" 

"I . . . I . . 

"Then you must favor it" 

"I don't know anything about 
any . . ." 

"Now, then, Mr. Craig," interrupted the head of the group.. 
"The Import service report shows 
that you passed your tests aboard 
your ship. You were enabled to 
accomplish this through night 
study." 

"Yes." 

"Yet you maintain in your application that you had considered 
the space service a career.** 

"I changed my mind." 

"Oh. You changed your mind, 
I see . ,

"XFTHAT do you do if they 
turn you down on your 
food ration?" Craig asked the 
man by his side on the bench. He 
had intended it as a vaguely humorous question. 

"You don't eat." 

"You mean they would actually let you starve?" 

"If you could not eat, you 
would starve," the man said 
matter-of-factly. 

"What's all this for, anyway? 
I mean the medical part." 

"You are rationed fairly in accordance with your particular 
metabolism." 

"You're kidding." 

"One does not jest of such matters," said the man, getting up to 
take a seat on another bench. 

"But I'd like to keep it as a 
souvenir'* 

"It is not permitted." 

"Look, it isn't issue. I bought 
the hide, had it made. I can pull 
off the marks of insignia and it's 
just another jacket . . ." 

"That is not the point, Mr. 
Craig. Your clothing ration is 
defined by law. There are no 
exceptions." 

"These are your permanent 
Quarters. You will occupy them 
immediately. Then, if you believe the location is wasteful of 
your time, you must petition the 
appropriate committee. This de


partment cannot accept such a 
petition." 

"Your petition to be permitted 
to purchase a private means of 
conveyance is hereby denied." 

THE big man leaned far back 
in the battered desk chair. It 
creaked at worn joints, but 
touched the wall without sliding 
from under its enormous load. 
The *nan was silent through 
Craig's long, confused speech. By 
turns he examined his fingernails, 
picked at yellowed teeth, and 
stared above his head at the discolored ceiling. 

". . . but you can get all this 
from iss, maybe even from Import, if they'll release my file," 
Craig argued. 

"Uh-huh," the big man said 
between closed lips. 

"I just made a mistake, that's 
all. You don't hear much about 
Terra out there. It was different 
in my father's day. It must have 
been different." 
"Yeah." 

"I haven't any character references on Terra, but I can post 
a good-sized bond if they'll release my ISS units." 

The space - freight agent 
glanced up at Craig at the remark. 

"Anyway, I can get my units 
anywhere iss has a base," Craig 
continued. "I can handle any

tiling up to 15 Gs acceleration 
without a new license. I can go 
heavier if I get a check ride." 

The fat man leaned forward in 
the protesting chair. "You got 
everything, but you can't go. I 
can't hire you." 

"Why not?" 

"Look, kid — Craig, is it? — how 
long you been in?" 

"Four days. I'm still working 
on my work clearances." 

"Four days. You tried Intergalactic to see if they'd take you 
back?" 

"Yes. Their hands are tied by 
my Terran contract." 

"And ours aren't, eh?" The 
man rose from t he desk and 
walked to a water tap. He popped 
a pill into his gaping mouth and 
drank from a tin cup. Then he 
returned to the inadequate chair. 
"So you're a spaceman. Flight 
officer — ex-flight officer. You 
know how to navigate through 
four star zones and the asteroid 
belt thrown in. You got a license 
for 15 Gs, could get five more. 
You got enough brains to pass 
Import's senior router's exam. 

"Still, you ain't got enough 
sense to come in out of the rain I" 

Craig sat upright in his chair. 

"We get guys like you two, 
three a day. You're hot. You're 
big. You're rarin* to go. But you 
ain't goin* nowhere!" 

Craig glared at .the big man. 

"I don't know how you got

business. Maybe you did quit 
honorable. Quit to follow your 
daddy's footsteps. Or maybe you 
went and burned up a colony 
somewhere !" 

"That would be in my records, 
wouldn't it?" Craig challenged. 

"It still don't make any difference. You're stuck here. Nobody;

Wordlessly she slid into the booth 
opposite him and made a sign 
for the bartender. 

"Have a drink?" Craig suggested, smiling. 
"Yeah." 
"Work here?" 
"What you mean by that?" 
"I mean if you get a percentage 
on the drinks, I can . . .** 
"I don't get no percentage," 
The bartender brought them a 
version of N'cadian taz. The girl 
■louched in the booth and sullenly tapped the glass. The lights 
in the bar had dimmed to simulate some kind of planetary night. 
The walls came alive with projected images of Terran constellations. On their table, a globe 
lamp began to glow. Tiny bright 
lights swung orbits around a 
miniature sun inside the lamp. 

As a miniature Pluto swung on 
its slow arc, an image of it was 
projected on the girl's dusky face. 



She seemed to be staring at nothing. 

"Why d'you call mc over 
here? You a purist, or don't you 
like the brand of sensatia -tapes 
they're peddlin' these days?" 

"I don't understand," Craig 
said. 

She smiled crookedly at him. 
Not a bad face, Craig decided, 
but hard, hard as the ceramiplate 
of a ship. She could not be very 
old. It was the kind of wild look 
in her eyes that gave her a false 
appearance of age. 

"Maybe you're writing a book 
—you got me over here for something." 

"I just got in," Craig answered. 

"What am I supposed to do 
for this drink?" 

"Nothing. Nothing at all. I suppose I thought . . . just skip it. 
I'm lonesome, that's all." 

"Lonely, huh?" said the girl. 
"Lonely and just in, huh? Just 
in from space." She turned away 
from him to signal the bartender. 
"What you need is drinks." 

There were more drinks. Many 
more drinks. The girl kept them 
coming, kept talking to him about 
— what was it? Craig looked at 
the girl and then at the globe 
lamp. He watched as the tiny 
bright orbs of light projected 
their images on the girl opposite 
him. He was aware of the gradual dimming of the lights, the 
suppression of sound in the bar.

He' watched the tiny lights of 
other globes appear around shadows, watched as the lights traced 
fiery trails across the dusky 
skin of the girl opposite him, 
watched as they crossed the 
warm, rounded flesh . . . 

"/ tell ya we didn't give him 
nothing but a coupla tazes." 

"The pump will determine that. 
You might as well tell the truth." 

"I am t elfin* the truth. He

"Four, five, six. Vou Jet her

"Hey, look, this guy's a spaceman, or was." 

"I didn't know that. Honest I

"All right, you didn't know.

"We denature the polyester just 
like the law says." 

"And you get it straight from 
M'cadii, eh?" 

"We put in some syn. So what? 
That ain't against the law." 

"He's probably got grav trouble. Chief." 

"Who was the girl?" 

"Girl? What girl?" 

"You know what girl!" 

"Just a girl, like a million of

"Professional?" 

"There ain't any any more.

**KiK3w her name?" 



*'T don't ask no names. How

"What you think a guy like

•'Why not?" 

"Well, look at /lis clothes. He'a 
got units, too. Can't figure thai 
out. She must've been after something else." 

"How about his clothing and 
food tickets?" 

"Uh . . . that's it. She got his 
tickets." 

"Come on, give me a hand. 
Lug him into the hold.'' 

THE hard face of the Civil Control chief peered down at him. 
It was a thick, red face that displayed no trace of feeling except 
perhaps toughness. It was long 
yet full, and it contained the 
proper features; but it added 
nothing of expression to the 
harsh, rasping voice. 

"First time in, eh? Or else Central's too damned lazy to check 
the file. Okay, I ain't going to 
cite you. Waste of time. But listen 
to me. You got problems, we 
got problems. You solve yours 
and don't come back here." 

Craig was aware of officers 
glowering at his back as he fumbled with the door button. The 
door opened onto a city street. 
It was entirely foreign to Craig. 
It was not a clean, straight thor

oughfare at the bottom of a canyon of towering white buildings 
and contrived but bright parks. 
It was an old street, a dirty 
street ; an incredible welter of 
color and line, of big and little 
shops, of dirty human shapes in 
drab gray. A flood of tone and 
noi se hit C ra i g as he e merge d 
from the station and descended 
the long, broad steps. 

Craig's head was in a whirl 
despite the strong dose of paraoxylnebutal he had taken in the 
station clinic. He felt closed in 
and befogged. He could remember almost nothing of the night 
in Civil Control. Even the clinic 
v/as fading from his memory. He 
was aware that he stank, that he 
was dirty, that his clothing clung 
to his body. He was miserable. 

He must call Import. He was 
due to begin work this morning, 
his period of personal adjustment 
complete. Instead, Craig turned 
end began to walk. He could not 
carry on a coherent conversation 
in his present state. He could 
never find his way unassisted 
back to his apartment; he was 
not even sure he remembered the 
address. But the thought of returning to his quarters, to Import 
sickened him. 

What was his address? East 7 I, 
North . . . No, that would be 
old lady Brockman. The association irritated him. He had completely forgotten the unwanted 



assignment, had forgotten to inquire where the address could be 
found. 

Craig became aware of the 
heavy flow of vehicular traffic 
that roared a scant eight fee', 
away. Large surface carrierr 
whistled in the nearest lane of 
the complex four-lane pattern. 
Then there were the private surface craft ; they were of many 
sizes and shapes. He guessed thai 
they were turbine-powered, but 
he could not identify the odor of 
their exhausts. 

There was an odd, unreal quality about the busy thoroughfare. 
Even myriad sounds from it were 
sounds he had never heard before and could not break down 
into thetr component parts. 

Craig became aware of other 
humans, many of them, 0:1 the 
sidewalk. Again they were of a 
class that he could not identify. 
They had none of the brisk, purposeful stride of those he had 
seen near Import. They lacked 
also the graceful, colorful dress. 
Their faces, so far as he could 
separate them from the blurring 
film over his eyes, were different. 

They seemed somehow looser 
faces, though Craig did not know 
exactly what he meant by the 
term. They were not tight, 
pinched, set, as were the faces 
he had seen before on Terra. 
There were bulbous noses, large 
ears, squint eyes, disheveled hair, 



SEA LEGS 



35 



the men's and women's faces 
strangely similar. Some were 
young, some old, but few were 
hard or fixed. They seemed more 
plastic, more full of expression 
than those he had come to know 
elsewhere in the city. He felt 
an inexplicable craving to know 
someone of this strange street. 

"You looking for something, 
mister?" asked a voice near him. 

Craig turned to find a middleaged man eying him from the 
doorway of an empty building. 
"I got it," the man added. 
"Got what?" Craig asked. 
"Anything a guy just outa the 
Can would want." 

"What would a *guy just outa 
the can* want that you have?" 
Craig examined the weathered, 
sharp face. It was an unpleasant 
one, but it belonged to this street; 
it would do to tell him what he 
wanted to know of the place. 

"Follow me." The man quickly 
inserted a magnikey into the door 
of the vacant store buildjng. 

"There's a station just up the 
Street," Craig warned. 
"Sure. So what?" 
The empty room was dusty and 
dark and received little light 
through the grimy display windows that faced on the street. 
What kind of store it had been, 
Craig could not guess. The man 
led him through a kind of storage 
room which was piled high with 
snoldy paper cartons and back to 



a rear door. With quick, dextrous 
movements, the man swung an 
ancient bar assembly and pushed 
open the rear door. It led to a 
litter-strewn yard enclosed by 
rough, eroded shacks and a 
wooden garage. 

They entered the garage 
through a creaking hinged door. 
It was a dank, almost completely 
dark room. Craig stumbled over 
something on the floor and fell 
against a packing box of some 
kind. 

"Just stand still." said the man. 
He was shuffling invisibly about 
in the darkness. Craig could hear 
him opening a kind of cabinet 
or drawer while saying in a steady 
monotone, "You got the right 
man, mister. My stuff is pure. 
You can test it. But you'd rather 
drink it, right?" 

For the tenth time, Craig asked 
himself why he had accepted the 
furtive invitation. The thought of 
this man's kind of intoxicant— 
however 'pure' — nauseated him. 
Nevertheless, he felt himself compelled by a kind of insatiable 
curiosity to follow out the part 
he had accepted. Perhaps through 
this man, through this somehow 
fascinating street, he could . . . 

"You got ten; I know that. 
Maybe you got more, huh?" the 
man interrupted his confused 
train of thought. 

"What makes you think I got 
ten?" Craig asked. He did not 



24 




 



know himself how many units 
his wallet contained — certainly 
not after the previous night. 

"Don't get sore. I'm honest. But 
I know you got ten. Otherwise 
you wouldn't have got out of the 
Station." 

The lack of clearly defined objects by which to orient himself 
in the darkness of the garage 
made his head begin to swim once 
more. He wanted to leave. 

"Don't get scared, buddy. They 
don't ever come in here." 

Craig fumbled for support in 
the darkness. He was afraid he 
would be sick. Fulfillment for the 
half-formed plan that was beginning to take shape in his mind 
would not come with the bootlegger. It would come into being 
somehow in the tawdry street he 
had just left, only he did not 
know how. 

"They don't really go after 
polyester. They don'J want to 
stop the stuff. It makes their 
job easier. You don't have to 
WQrry, buddy. Come on, how 
much you want? You might have 
trouble finding more for a while." 

Craig said nothing. He fumbled 
for a grip on a packing box. 

"You're from Out, aren't you, 
buddy? You ain't used to us 
here yet. Most of my customers 
ere^ from Out. What jam'd you 
get into?" 

"I got ten units, I think," Craig 
evaded. 



"It ain't none of my business 
what you done. Nobody around 
here is going to ask you any questions. Long as you got units, you 
get poly like the big shots that 
come over here all the way from 
Uptown." 

"Yeah," said Craig. "Gimme 
what I get for ten units and let's 
beat it out of here." 

"Myself, I never been Out. Not 
even Luna. Never wanted to. I 
stay here and have my little business — you can call it a business. 
You'll see, buddy, there are millions of guys like me. The controllers don't stop 'us. We're 
respectable. A damned sight more 
respectable than those . . ." 

"All right," snapped Craig. 
"Let's get out of here." 

"You got it bad, huh? This 
poly will fix that up. It's pure. 
You just come back to old Nave 
and get poly." 

"How . . . how you get out of 
here?" asked Craig, nauseated. 

"Get lost pretty easy in the 
dark, huh?" The man was beginning to mock him. 

Craig lashed out suddenly at 
the unseen face in the darkness. 
He caught the thin throat in his 
left hand. His right left the packing box and cocked to deliver a 
blow. But he began to fall and 
had to let go. 

"Okay, buddy, okay," the otlhef 
man said soothingly as Craig was 
forced to catch himself. "I like 



SEA IEGS 



17 



ex-spacemen. I Itnow lots of you. 
I sell you poly. You don't want 
to get tough with me." 

He shoved a block of ten smalt 
cubes into Craig*s hand and, 
while Craig fished for his wallet, 
he produced a tiny, narrowbeamed flash. The transaction 
was quickly over. The cube was 
small enough to be forced without much difficulty into Craig's 
jacket pocket. 

The man led him back across 
the tittered yard, through the 
empty store building, and out the 
front door. When Craig emerged 
onto the street once more, a uniformed figure was standing nearby. 

"He'll need two," whispered the 
man from behind him. 

Craig reached into his pocket 
and mechanically fumbled two of 
the small cubes of waxltke substance from the loose package. 
He placed them on the outstretched hand of the Civil Control officer. The officer did not 
look in his direction at any time, 
but accepted the offer and walked 
slowly on toward the station. 

Craig continued aimlessly 
down the long street. His head 
cleared as he walked and once 
more began to form a kind of 
vague plan. There was anonymity 
to a street such as this. There 
was also a kind of freedom. 
Everywhere in the universe, there 
were such stree ts. Neutralized 



streets, where a kind of compromise was reached between law 
and lawlessness. They were permitted because it was always 
necessary to provide such a place 
for those who were not permitted 
elsewhere. Those who would not 
fit, could not be "rehabilitated," 
could neither be jailed nor permitted complete freedom. 

Controllers of one kind or another patrolled such streets, keeping them in a kind of check — or, 
more accurately, in a kind of 
containment. But no amount of . 
control would ever completely 
stamp out the likes of Nave, the 
bootlegger. 

Perhaps here, on this street, 

Craig could be "lost." Here he 
might find security for a time in 
anonymity, security and time to 

find a way ... to what? He did 

not know. 

"Mister! Mister!" cried a thin, 

high voice from somewhere to 

his left. "Here, quick!" 

It was a young boy of perhaps 

nine or ten. Craig caught sight 

of him as he motioned urgently. 

He wore a shabby, torn version 

of what appeared to be a space 

service uniform. 

"I'm not buying anything, son." 

Craig said, pausing briefly. 

"Come here, quick!" insisted 

the boy, his eyes large in a dirty 

face. "You already bought too 

much." 

The boy was motioning him to 



28 




 



follow. He had stepped between 
two buildings. Craig approached 
him with suspicion. 

"What did you say?" 

"Slip in here quick! You 
bought from Nave the peddler. 
You bought poly, didn't ya?" 

"How did you . .. Craig 
began. 

"Tell you later. Slip through 
here quick or they'll send you to 
Hardy!" 

The genuine fear of the youngster conveyed itself to Craig. With 
effort he forced his body through 
the space between the old buildings. At first he did not intend 
to follow the boy, but only to 
stop him for an explanation. The 
boy, however, continued down the 
tight corridor formed by the 
buildings. 

"There's • window soon," he 
said from nhead of Craig. "Hurry. 
You lost timy with that peddler." 

Lost time? Cursing himself for 
becoming involved again in something he did not understand, 
Craig nevertheless followed as 
best he could. It was a tight 
squeeze and he found himself becoming breathless. 

"Dive down!" shouted the boy, 
looking back with terror in his 
eyes. 

Instinctively Craig did so. The 
rough walls tore at his suit. 

"Stop!" shouted a voice from 
behind Craig. "Stop or we fire!" 

Craig suddenly felt the sill of 



a window which opened into the 
building to his left. He quickly 
pulled himself into it. There was 
a sickening whine and a part of 
the window distingrated in a 
cloud of splinters and plaster. 

"Through here," said the boy 
from the semi -darkness. "They'll 
blast their way inside in a minute!" 

Craig found himself in another 
empty building. He followed the 
boy through a doorway and felt 
his way as he half ran along the 
dark hall. 

"Who are they?" he panted. 

"Controllers." 

"Civil Control?" 

"Sure. You must be pretty important. I didn't get it all. But 
they say the controllers checked 
up on you after . , . I'll explain 
later." 

The hall ended in a dim room 
piled high with plasmolite packing boxes in great disarray. The 
boy chose a box and lifted a lid. 

"Follow me. It's a passage." 

"Where to?" 

"No time now. Down here. 

The passage, which seemed to 
be constructed of plasmolite 
boxes, seemed somehow lit by 
daylight, although Craig could 
not actually see the source of 
the light. 

The tunnel ended in broad afternoon daylight. As he climbed 
out he saw a large clearing surrounded by ruins. 



SEA LEGS 



"We're just inside the old city," 
the boy said. ."We're safe now— 
unless those controllers are willing to take more chances than I 
think." 

"Wait a minute, son. You said 
'old city.' You mean that this is 
a part of pre-war Los Angeles?"" 

"Well, sure." 

"But that's supposed to be ... 

''Radioactive? Most of it, anyway. Good thing, too. Otherwise 
we'd have no place to go." 

"Look, kid, you better explain," 
said Craig,. "You were right about 
somebody being after me, but I 
don't get the 'we* business. Or 
how you knew all about this." 

"All right, mister, but let's get 
away from here. Those guys won't 
come through to here, even if they 
find a way — I don't think. But 
they're gettin* smarter and you're 
pretty hot right now." 

The boy led the way to what 
appeared to be a completely demolished building. 

"Used to be the old library," 
he said. 

They circled the heap of plaster, brick, and twisted steel. On 
the other side Craig saw what 
appeared to be a window. The 
boy let himself down through it. 

Craig was amazed to find a 
large, relatively clear area inside, 
probably part of an old room that 
had been spared by some freak of 
the blast. 

"You tivs here?" Craig asked 



the youngster incredulously. 

"Part of the time." The boy 
brought up an old crate and offered it to Craig as a chair. 
"Listen, mister, I don't know who 
you are. You're an ex-spaceman 
and that's enough for me." There 
was a slightly amusing attempt 
at adult hardness about him, 
"You shouldn't have wasted time 
with Nave. You should have got 
out of there." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know. What you done P 
anyway?" 

"I don't remember. Passed out 
at a bar . . ." 

The boy showed disgust. He 
glanced at the pocket which contained the polyester. 

Craig smiled. (£ I don't use this 
stuff. At least not enough to deserve what you're thinking." He 
tossed the remaining cubes on the 
littered floor of the room. 

The boy maintained his look 
of scorn for a time, but then 
softened. "I was afraid you got 
kicked out of the service for that." 

"How did you know I was ever 
in it?" 

"Easy. You don't know how 
to walk on a planet yet. Anybody 
can tell." 

"I didn't get kicked out," Craig 
said. "I came here to take a civil 
service job." 

"It'd almost be better if you 
had been." 

"I didn't know about Terra. 




 



None of us had any idea." 

"I know," said the boy sadly. 
"My father quit, too. He quit to 
marry my mother. That was before it was ... so bad." 

"Where — " Craig began, then 
bit off the question. 

"Oh, gee, mister, Terra's in en 
awful bad shape! They took . , . 
my parents. They hunt us down. 
They . . 

Craig approached the boy and 
put a hand on his shoulder. 
"What's your name, son?" 

"Phil." 

"Phil what?" 

"I don't know exactly. My father had to use so many names 
toward the . . . end. He once had 
only one name, but I guess even 
he forgot what it was." 

HpHEY prepared to spend the 
night in the old library room, 
but first Phil left it and made his 
way into the wilderness of rubble. 
He returned dragging a packing 
box of plastic insulating material, 
out of which they fashioned a 
crude bed. Despite the thousands 
of questions that paraded across 
Craig's mind, he waited each 
time for the boy to speak. 

"I can't take you any further 
until . . ." 

"Until you know more about 
me?" 

"In a way. They* It let me 
know." 

Craig would have risked much 



to identify the "they" Phil referred to, but he did not ask the 
question. As he watched the boy 
preparing the dimly lit room for 
ihe night, he felt sure Phil could 
be trusted. He was almost frightf ningly mature for his age. 

The room was well hidden, for 
the once great library lay in a 
powdered ruin about "it on all 
sides but a part of one. Only by 
accident or knowledge would a 
stranger recognize it in what was 
literally a world of rubble. During 
the moments of silence between 
Ihe boy's volunteered statements, 
Craig tried to visualize the awful 
catastrophe that had befallen the 
old city. Piles of powdered masonry restricted his view greatly 
under the gathering night. He 
could see a scant city block 
Ihrough the window, but he knew 
the wreckage around them must 
extend for miles. 

"You don't have to worry, mister . . ." 

"Craig." 

"Mr. Craig. They don't come 
in here at night." 

"Radioactivity?" 

"Yes. Not right here, but all 
around, everywhere." 

"What?" 

"It's all around us. You go 
through it to get here, but you 
can't stay anywhere but a few 
places like this." 

"How do you know all of these 
things, Phil?" 



SiA IEGS 



"Oh, we know, all right. We 
had to find out.'* 

"You must have ion counters,** 
he said in what he hoped was 
a casual tone. 

"We have lots of things." 
Craig was thoughtful for a minute. The boy was obviously on 
his guard now. 

"Those empty buildings?*' 
Craig asked tentatively. 

"They built them too close," 
said the boy. It seemed to be « 
safe subject. "They built them 
up as close as they thought was 
safe. Space is very valuable here. 
But they built them too close." 

"Yet the 'we' you speak of live 
even closer?" 

The boy bit his Hp and eyed 
him suspiciously in silence. 

"Look, kid,*' Craig said very 
deliberately, "I'm not a controller 
and I'm not interested in a bunch 
of petty thieves." 

The effect was just what he had 
intended. "We're not thieves !" 
And we're not traitors, either! 
We're . . " 

The boy was almost in tears. 
Craig waited a moment, then continued in a soft voice. "Phil, I'm 
just beginning to realize what a 
rotten place Terra is. From just 
what I've seen — it isn't very much 
—I can imagine such a system 
producing a great many 'we' 
groups like yours. I don't know 
who you are or what you are, 
hut you can't be any worse than 

32 



what I've already seen of Terran officials. Tell me, kid, what's 
it all about? And is there any way 
out of here? I mean — way out!" 

"You may tell him, Philip/' 
said a quiet voice from the window entrance. "Like us, Philip, 
Mr. Craig is an enemy of tyranny, 
though he doesn't realize it yet." 

Craig instinctively jumped 
back to get out of range of 
the window, meanwhile feeling 
around for something that could 
be used as a weapon. But the 
boy ran to the silhouetted figure 
in the window. 

"Mr. Sam!" he cried eagerly. 

Craig relaxed his hold on a 
strip of heavy metal. When the 
man had entered, the boy pulled 
a ragged black cloth across the 
window once more. He then ignited a small oil burning lamp 
in a carved-out nook in the wall. 

"It's all right, Philip, nobody 
is following me," the newcomer 
said. 

Craig studied his face. It was 
an old face covered by a stained 
gray beard. With a shock Craig 
recognized the man as a tramp 
he had seen earlier on the street, 
napping, sprawled in a doorway. 
Now for the first time he saw the 
eyes. Sharp and clear, they 
caught up the yellow light of the 
oil lamp and glowed warmly as 
they turned to Craig. 

"I am 'Mr. Sam,* Mr. Craig. 
You might know me by the full 

; A L A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



name, Samuel Cocteau, but I 
doubt it. Even the names of the 
infamous do not penetrate space." 

"I guess not," Craig agreed. 
"But you said something about 
my being an enemy of tyranny." 

"Whether you like it at once 
or not, you are temporarily one 
of us — one of the 'we' Philip has 
been speaking of. But all of that 
in due time. Right now it is necessary for us to leave here." , 

"They're going to try to find 
us tonight?" asked Phil, startled. 

"Yes, a tribute to Mr. Craig," 
said the old man. "A Geiger team 
is being readied at the station." 

Craig started to protest as the 
boy began hurriedly to pick up 
his few possessions in the room. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Craig," the 
man said. "I must ask you to 
decide now whether to trust us 
and our judgment. There is grave 
danger for you if you are caught 
by the Civil Control. The report 
I have received is that you are 
largely unaware of the 'crimes 
against the state' you have committed. The Civil Control hoped 
to capture you before you find 
them out. But that, of course, is 
my word only. There is no time 
to give you proof, even if I had 
it." 

Craig's mind whirled under the 
sudden onslaught of new facts. He 
had followed a peddler without 
knowing why he did it. He had 
bought polyester he had no use 



for. He had followed a boy who 
beckoned to him. Now — how 
much longer was he to move haphazardly through Terra like a 
cork on a wind-blown sea? Whq 
were these strange fugitives who 
said he was one of them and who 
lived in the heart of a radioactive 
city? 

"Well, Mr. Craig?" asked Cocteau quietly. 

Craig glanced at the boy. The 
child's eyes were wide and pleading in the dim light of the oil 
lamp. 

"Let's go," Craig said. 

"p^ARKNESS was swiftly falling 
on the wilderness of heaping 
ruin. The three made their way 
toward what Craig at first 
thought was an unbroken wall of 
rubble. The near-horizontal rays 
of the sun tipped the white mass 
of broken stone with brilliance, 
and gave the entire scene an unearthly quality. Below the towering rubble mountains, long black 
shadows were reaching toward 
what Craig knew to be the living 
city. 

Cocteau took the lead nod set 
a fast pace for a man of hi* m*e. 
He took a highly deviou-; p Uh 
through the "mountain," or 'iat 
began to seem to Craig need!, ly 
difficult and that outlined them 
against the bright western sky. 
At one point Craig left the invisible path of the older man to 



SEA LEGS 



33 



avoid an exhaustingly steep rise. 

"Follow me exactly," warned 
Cocteau in a sharp voice. "There 
is only one relatively safe patli 
through here." 

"They'll see us against the 
Sky!" 

*'It cannot be helped." 
But there was no indication 
that they were followed. They 
pushed onwaTd, scurrying over 
heaps of weathered plaster and 
brick. The old man seemed to 
avoid with great care places 
where metal girders were visible. 

The exertion together with 
walking directly into the setting 
sun made Craig begin to feel the 
old nausea return. He resisted it 
for a time, but it would not be 
repressed, particularly as he 
strove to maintain his balance 
on difficult climbs. Once he stumbled on a splintered building 
Stone and fell. It was a long minute before he could regain his 
feet and mutter a feeble, "Sorry." 

"We must push on, Mr. Craig," 
was Cocteau's only comment. 

"It's safe here for a minute, 
isn't it?" Craig panted, dizzy and 
breathless. 

"There is no Safe place here, 
Mr. Craig." 

They continued their winding 
way through the growing darkness. For Craig it became a nightmare of stumbling over the endless piles of sharp stones. His 
mind spun sickeningly and he 



retched as he half ran along the 
path Cocteau set for them. 

"Please, mister," breathed the 
voice of Ph il behind him . "It 
isn't so far now." 

Doggedness carried Craig onward long after awareness left 
him. 

¥¥E became conscious suddenly, 
as though by an injection of 
stimulant. He found himself surrounded by a number of figures, 
including Cocteau and a white 
garbed man, evidently a doctor. 

"You are quite safe now, Mr. 
Craig," said Cocteau warmly. 
"Welcome to the City of We" 

"Where are we?" 

"Deep in the old city, in a place 
where the radioactivity is negligible," the man answered as the 
doctor took his pulse. "This is 
Dr. Grant and these others are 
members of the Liberty party." 

"Liberty!" 

"You've heard of it?" 

"Yeah, you're pretty unpopular, aren't you?" 

"Unpopular? Let us say that 
all of Terran officialdom is dedicated to exterminating us." 

"The committee on somethingor-other asked me about my attitudes toward the Liberty party." 
said Craig, rising to a sitting position on the cot. 

"And at the time you had a 
lack of attitude, which most likely 
was unacceptable to them," sup



 



plied Cocteau, smiling. "Well, 
you may be interested to know 
that you are considered one of us 
by most of Terra just now." 
"What?" 

"That is correct," said another 
of the group. "It seems you were 
in a bar in — ah — in a somewhat 
less than fully conscious state . . ." 

"But I didn't know anything 
about the Liberty party." 

"No, nor is it alleged that you 
actually mentioned the party in 
so many words," continued the 
white-haired man, smiling. "But 
it seems that you did make certain statements in the presence 
of certain persons that did indicate a definite predilection . . ." 

"That's crazy," said Craig angrily. 

"Of course," Cocteau agreed. 

"Furthermore," the other man 
said, "you are charged with wilful abandonment of duty and 
'acts indicative of your desire to 
sfiun the best utilization of your 
talents in behalf of the state of 
Terra.* " 

"In other words," explained 
Cocteau, "you applied for a job 
on a private space freighter. 
Without permission to do so." 

Craig was silent. He lay back 
down on the cot and tried to 
absorb the data he had just received. 

"So I'm accused of belonging 
to something I don't know anything about?" 



"Then HI tell you briefly about 
us. You have a right to know 
the magnitude of the crime with 
which you are charged." Cocteau 
took a seat by Craig's cot. The 
others also found chairs. 

"But first a brief bit of history 
— a history that you have never 
heard before. Not your fault. It 
is not allowed to penetrate Terra's 
atmosphere." 

"I don't know much about 
Terra," Craig interjected. "I'm 
just finding out how much I don't 
know." 

"God, I wish the rest of the 
Universe could find out with 
you!" said one of the group. 

"Yes, the history of Terra is 
almost lost now. That is, the part 
of it that followed the Great Wars 
of seventy-five years ago. You 
know of those wars; you have just 
walked through one of the physical results of them. No nation or 
alliance of nations can be said 
to have won them, but the wars 
had a most profound effect upon 
Terra. More than Anything else, 
they made men reach to the stars, 
if only to escape the deadly conflicts of Terra. 

"Ideological issues were involved, naturally, but the underlying cause of the Great Wars 
was the struggle for power. The 
world was disunited. Peoples were 
divided from peoples by an almost inconceivable number of unimportant distinctions. These 



SEA LEGS 



35 



were ethnical, national, racial, 
cultural — name any brand of 
prejudice and you'll find it existed then. 

"Incredibly enough, the destructiveness of the Great Wars 
accomplished a kind of unity. 
Gone were the once proud aggressive nations. Gone into oblivion. Gone, too, were the 
systems of economics and sociology of which men were once 
so sure. There was a kind of 
'plague -on -both -your -houses' attitude among the peoples of the 
world. There was a large measure of ■ anarchy following the 
Great Wars. Not a violent, active 
anarchy of hate and terror, but 
of apathy and weariness. Apathy 
at the outcome of false conflicts, 
and weariness of the self-defeating strife of man against man. 

"At first men produced by the 
full extent of their labors barely 
enough on which to survive. Only 
gradually did they regain their 
ability to produce surpluses once 
more. Of course, surpluses mean 
exchanges — trade. And trade requires order and system. 

"The first ten years following 
the Great Wars was a period of 
gradualism in all things. Peoples 
united in small groups. There 
were no political or racial divisions. The units were built upon 
functional lines. They were natural and free. Above all, they 
were cooperative. 



"It wai not communism. Men 
knew all too well the mental and 
physical slavery of that brutally 
rigid system. It was not rugged 
individualism either. Rugged individuals during this period 
cither starved or were driven out 
by the starving. 

"This natural, cooperative 
unity spread and became more 
complex. There came into being 
natural associations of units. Not 
exclusive but inclusive associations that linked all who would 
join and could produce surpluses. 
Productivity increased thereby. 
Men were intelligent enough t» 
avoid many of the old abuses. 

"Ways were found to harness 
the productivity of each man and 
woman. Genuine efforts were 
made to avoid misfits, to make 
those who produced fit. It was 
realized, Mr. Craig, that the unhappy man will infect others with. 
his misery, and the trouble he 
will cause is much more difficult 
to undo than to prevent in the 
first place. 

"There were, of course, mistakes, false starts. But the newfound system of world-wide unity, 
proved flexible. It was multiplebased. To a very large degree, all 
men fitted into it logically and 
naturally. It was the first truly 
*grass-roots* economic and social 
system in the history of man. 
And it was a great tribute to his 
ability to work out his destiny. 




 



particularly since it came after 
a tragedy that was so enormous 
and devastating. 

"The list -of its successes is incredible. For in a decade the ageold problem of poverty seemed 
to have disappeared. There were 
no significant outbreaks of disorder and lawlessness — indeed, 
there was comparatively little 
need for a written law. The principle of mutuality and cooperation was too strongly conditioned 
into the people. 

"Scientifically, the first half of 
the new century, a scant twentyfive years after the last bomb 
was dropped, was the greatest in 
man's history. Man reached the 
stars. He began to know the molecule, the atom, the electron. He 
pushed the frontier of his knowledge deep into both microcosm 
and macrocosm. 

"But a fatal flaw had long before developed in the structure, 
wonderful as it was. It was an 
age-old flaw. It was one that was 
disguised by the very nature of 
the new system. When it was 
recognized, that flaw had so 
weakened the system that its 
spread was all but inevitable. It 
is a flaw that will always plague 
man to a certain extent, but one 
that must keep us eternally vigilant. 

"It is this: the greatest human 
good comes not in how well you 
learn to control man and keep 



him froni harming himself. What 
determines it is how completely 
you learn to free hint. 

"Conversely, the law provides 
that no control system, however 
devised, will succeed, in bringing 
happiness and security to man 
to any greater extent than it permits the fullest expression of his 
nature. 

"Man is inherently good. He 
will always choose a moral path 
when free to do so. He strives 
for justice and truth both as an 
individual and in mass. 

"Mr. Craig, democracy is man's 
greatest a priori. Yet based upon 
a law of restraint, it cannot escape the hopeless contradiction 
that leads to its own destruction. 
Man can democratically do the 
irrational and the insane. He can 
democratically limit and coerce 
the absolute highest nature of 
himself. Bad laws are forever 
passed to achieve good ends. But 
each new law produces new criminals while the cause of the new 
crime remains unsolved. 

"Ergo, the world you have just 
seen. Ergo, the Liberty party. Mr. 
Craig, our world is ruled by a 
vast and horrible bureaucracy 
whose terrible weapon is conformity. You would find few laws 
even today written in books. Our 
assemblies pass few statutes. 
They determine dogma instead. 
They 'resolve' and 'move.' They

It had been a long speech. 
Craig had listened in awe, for it 
was a completely new story to 
him. 

"And you propose to destroy 
this bureaucracy?" he said. 

"In so far as it is a philosophical entity, yes." 

"And you say I am one of you 
now?" 

"You are considered one of us. 
Your employer and his secretary 
are also suspected.*' 

"But I'm entitled to a trial, or 
at least a hearing.'* 

"Not now, Mr. Craig. It would 
do you little good, anyway. The 
'position' of the Assembly on subversion is that it 'rightly behooves 
every loyal Terran so to conduct 
his behavior that a suspicion of 
membership in the Liberty party 
is unthinkable.' " 

Craig found himself regretting 




38 




 



I've seen plenty of that bureaucracy and there seems to be 
damned little freedom of action 
left on Terra. But how do I know 
you can do any better when you 
get in power?" 

-"Liberty will never be 'in 
power,' Mr. Craig," Cocteau said 
quietly. "Liberty wjll attempt to 
reach the minds of the people 
with our message of hope, of 
freedom in true democracy." 

Another of the group joined 
Cocteau. "We are now hunted as 
criminals. We have only this 
small stronghold in the old city." 



"We shall attempt only to gain 
entry to the minds of the people," 
said Cocteau. "Gain entry to tell 
them how they live, for most of 
them have had no contact with 
any other kind of life." 

"It would mean killing a few 
people," Craig pointed out. 

"One of the basic principles of 
Liberty is the inherent goodness 
of every man," Cocteau repeated. 
"We have never taken a life, even 
in self-defense. We shall never 
take one. Nor will it , ever be 
necessary for a member of the 
Liberty party to hold public of




fice, to own a weapon, to coerce 
a man in any physical way." 

"But you will coerce them with 
ideas. Is that what you have in 
mind?" Craig protested. 

"If a point of view, a promise, 
3 goal is coercion, then the answer to your question is yes. But 
ideas are not dangerous when a 
man is free to argue and act 
against them." 

"Look here, Cocteau," Craig 
said earnestly, "all you say may 
be true. I believe it is. But what 
can I do? I'm a spaceman, or 
at best an apprentice import clerk. 
I don't know anything about this 
sort of work." 

"Come here a moment," invited 
a member of the group. 

Through the window indicated 
by the man, Craig saw an incredible sight. The entire scene 
seemed to be on the inside of a 
vast underground cavern. There 
were other buildings and some 
kind of systematic work being 
done by many men and women. 
But the thing that caught Craig's 
eye seemed to be cradled in a 
kind of hangar. 

. "A spaceship!" exclaimed 
Craig. 

"A very modest one, yet not 
so modest when you consider that 
it was necessary to carry in every 
single piece and part by hand." 

"Good Lord!" 

"You, Mr. Craig, might captain that ship. Very few Terrans 



have ever even flown in one. It 
will be necessary to establish contact with possible assistance outside of Terra. You can make that 
possible." 

Craig was thoughtful, "I suppose, now that I've seen all this, 
you can't let me leave here unless 
I join you." 

"No," denied Cocteau. "You 
may leave here any time you 
like." 

"I'd be sure to get caught, of 
course . . ." 

"Within limits, it might be possible to help you avoid capture." 
Cocteau reached into his beggar's 
coat and withdrew a wallet. 
"Identity card, food ration, 
clothing, work card, even a Government party card. It's all here, 
Mr. Craig. You could have a 
slightly altered physical appearance. Liberty accepts no unwilling members. You are given as 
nearly a free choice in this matter 
as is possible to give you." 

"Suppose I talked?" asked 
Craig, nodding bluntly toward 
the port. 

Cocteau smiled. "It was necessary to prepare for that. You 
were given a drug. It has not affected your thinking capacity in 
any way. But once it wears off, 
you will be unable to remember 
what took place while under its 
influence. 

"When agents of the Liberty 
party are sent out of here, they

go having had all experience with 
Liberty take place while under 
the drug. None of us could remember for more than a few 
hours the exact location of this 
headquarters. When it is necessary to leave for very long, we 
carry a small amount of the 
drug with us. Many of our agents 
have been caught and a few have 
resigned. But none has divulged 
enough information to harm us 
seriously." 

Craig was postponing his decision to the last. "They must 
know you're somewhere in here. 
If the radioactivity keeps them 
out, why shouldn't they put a 
cordon around the entire old 
city ?" 

"Periodically, they try. But 
there are many, many other ways 
of leaving here than by the surface. Underground water conduits, ancient power and sewer 
lines, a number of tunnels we 
have dug . . 

Craig was solemnly handed the 
wallet. 

"If you will submit to sufficient 
plastic surgery to make you resemble this man, you may safely 
leave here no later than tomorrow 
night." 

A long silence ensued. It was 
Interrupted by a noise from outside the door of the room. It was 
the voice of Phil. 

"Has he decided to stay? Did 
you see him? He looks like my 



daddy did . . . Will he stay?'* 
"You mustn't interrupt, son. 

They're in conference now. We'll 

let you know.** 

"Tell him yes!" said Craig in 

a loud voice. "Tell him hell, yes, 

I'm staying!" 

The men gathered around htm 

to congratulate him on the decision. 

Phil was allowed in the clinic 
to join them. 

"Oh, Cocteau, one more thing," 
Craig said.. 
'."Yes?" 

Craig was fumbling for his own 
wallet. He extracted a folded 
card. j v 

"Where would East 71, North 
101, Number 4 be?" 

"It would have been somewhere 
here in Old City." 

"God! How did the old guy 
expect me to deliver this message? Old man named Brockman. 
He sent me a message just before 
he died in Gravitation. I was to 
visit his wife." 

"Brockman?" asked Cocteau. 
"You mean Ethel Brockman?" 

"Yeah. How'd you know?" 

"Ethel Brockman was one of 
the organizers of the Liberty 
party. She served as its chairman 
until her death only a few years 
ago. Her husband must have felt 
your 'sea legs* would lead you to 
us eventually. And, of course, 
they did." .

"A klepto? What are you waiting for?" asked the other. "Let's

"Watch her for a moment. 
There's something damned

her hands running over the merchandise on the shelf. She took 
three cookie cutters, and popped 
them into the pocketbook. Two 
large cake tins and a potato

Then a large aluminum skillet.

She looked up blankly, then

picked it up. It felt like a pocketbook. "What's in it?" 

"You tell us," Evanson said. 

Collins opened it up. It was 
curiously dark inside, with a dull 
metallic ring around the inside, 
near the top. He turned it upside 
down, and shook it. Nothing came 
out. 

"Don't reach around inside," 
Evanson cautioned. "It's not safe. 
One fellow tried, and lost a wristwatch." 

Collins looked up, his bland 
full face curious. "Where did you 
get this?" 

"A couple of section managers 
spotted a shoplifter down in the 
Taylor-Hyden store a couple of 
days ago. She was helping herself 
to kitchen hardware, and was 
Stuffing anything and everything 
into the pocketbook. They nabbed her, but when they tried to 
get the hardware back out of the 
pocketbook, they couldn't find 
any. One of them lost a wristwatch groping around in it." 

"Yes, but how did you wind up 
with the purse?" 

Evanson shrugged. "Ever since 
■the end of the war in '71, when 
they organized Psych, they've 
turned shoplifters over to them. 
This woman was taken to Psych, 
but when they jarred her into remembering who she was, she 
couldn't recall having the purse. 
After Psych had looked at the 
pocketbook, they naturally sent it

over to us. Here, I'll show you 
why." 

Evanson picked up a meter 
Btick, and began to push it into 
the pocketbook. It went in about 
ten centimeters,, to the bottom of 
the purse — 

And kept on going. 

It didn't poke out the bottom. 
It didn't even bulge the purse. 

Collins goggled at it. "Holy 
smoke, how'd you do that?" 

"Maybe it's going somewhere 
else. Fourth dimension. I don't 
know." 

"Nuts!" 

"Where else, then?" Evanson. 
laid the meter stick down. "Another thing about that pocketbook," he added. "No matter 
what you do, you can't turn it 
inside out." 

Collins looked at the dark inside of the pocketbook. Gingerly 
he stuck his finger in, rubbed the 
metallic ring, scratched it with his 
nail. A shiny line appeared. 
"That's aluminum in there," he 
said. "An aluminum circle." 

Evanson took it and looked. 
"All the stuff she was stealing 
was aluminum." he said. "That's 
one reason we called you. You 
know your mechanics, and you 
know your metals. We've been 
trying for three days to figure out 
what happens here. We can't. 
Maybe you can." 

"What have you been doing?** 

"Pushing st uff in. Che eking 



it with all the instruments, X-ray, 
everything. Didn't tell us a thing. 
We'd like to know where that 
stuff goes that we push in." 

Collins dropped an aluminum 
button into the purse. It went 
through the aluminum circle and 
vanished. "Say," he asked suddenly, scowling, "what do you 
mean, you can't turn this thing 
inside out?" 

"It's a second-order geometric 
form." Evanson lit a cigarette 
carefully. "You can turn a firstorder form, like a sphere or rubber ball, inside out through a 
small hole in the surface. But you 
can't turn an inner-tube inside 
out. no matter what you do." 

"Why not?" 

"Because it's got a hole in it. 
And you can't pull a hole through 
a hole. Not even an infinitesimal 
hole." 

"Well?" said Collins, frowning. 

"It's the same thing with that 
purse. We think it's wrapped 
around a chunk of another 
verse. A four-dirhensional universe. And you can't pull a chunk 
of another universe through this 
one, without causing a lot of 
trouble." 

"But you can turn an innertube insi de out," Coll ins protested. "It may not look like an 
inner-tube any more, but it will 
all come through the hole." 

Evanson eyed the pocketbook 
on the table. "Maybe so. A sec


TIGER WITH A TAIl

©nd -order geometric under condition of stress. But there's one 
hitch to that. It won't be an inner-tube any more." 

"CWANSON pushed the fourth 
item made of aluminum into 
the purse. He shook his head 
tiredly. "I don't knojv. Something 
is taking that aluminum — " He 
pushed in a wooden ruler; it 
popped right out again. "And it 
wants only aluminum. Nothing 
else. That detective had an aluminum military watch, which disappeared from his wrist, but he 
had two gold rings on that hand, 
and neither one was touched." 

"Let's play some thinking 
games," Collins said. 

Evanson looked up sharply. 
"What do you mean?" 

Collins grinned. "Whatever is 
on the other side of that pocketbook seems to want aluminum. 
Why? There's an aluminum ring 
around the mouth of the purse — 
ell around it. Like a portal. But 
it isn't very big, and it doesn't 
use much aluminum. They seem 
to want lots more." 

"They?" 

"Whatever takes the metal, but 
pushes back the wood." 
"Why?" 

"We could venture a guess. 
Maybe they're building another 
opening. A large one." 

Evanson stared at him. "Don't 
be silly," he said. "Why — " 



"I was just thinking out loud," 
said Collins mildly. He picked up 
a steel meter stick. Taking a firm 
grip on one end, he pushed the 
other end into the purse. 

Evanson watched, puzzled. 
"They don't want it. They're trying to push it back." 

Collins continued to insert the 
stick, with pressure, and suddenly 
the end appeared, coming back 
out. Like a flash Collins grabbed 
it, and began tugging both ends 
at once. 

"Watch it. watch it!" Evanson 
snapped. "You're making their 
universe conform to our geometry!" The purse seemed to sag 
inward. 

One end of the rod suddenly 
slipped out of Collins hand. He 
ft 11 back, grasping the stick. It 
was straight: 

"Evanson!" he snapped excitedly. "Can you get a winch up 
here?" 

Evanson blinked dully, and 
nodded. 

"Good," said Collins. "I think 
I know how we can hook onto 
their universe." 

THE big three-inch steel bar 
rolled easily into the lab on a 
dolly. The end of the bar, for 
inches, was covered with shiny 
aluminum tubing, and bent into a 
sharp hook. 

"Is the winch ready?" Collins 
asked excitedly. 



46 




 



Evanson told him it was. 

"Then slide the purse onto the 
end of the bar." 

The end of the bar disappeared 
into the pocketbook. 

"What are you trying to do?" 
Evanson asked uneasily. 

"They seem to want aluminum, 
so we're going to give them some. 
If they're building another opening through with it, I want to 
hook onto the opening and pull it 
out into this lab. They'll be putting the aluminum on this bar 
with the rest. If we can hook onto 
that aluminum, they'll either 
have to cut it free and let us retrieve it, or open it into this lab.** 

Evanson scowled. "But what if 
they don't do either?" " 

"They have to. If we pull a 
non-free section of their universe 
through the purse, it will put a 
terrific strain on their whole geometric pattern. Their whole universe will be twisted. Just like an 
inner-tube." 

The winch squeaked as Collins 
worked the bar to and fro ininside the purse. 

"Up a little," he said to the 
operator. 

Evanson shook his head sourly. 
*I don't see — " he began. The bar 
twanged under sudden pressure. 

"Hold it! You've got it 
hooked!" Collins shouted. 

The winch squealed noisily, the 
motor whining under the strain. 
The steel bar slid slowly out of 

TIGER WITH A TAIL 



the purse, millimeter by millimeter, pulled as taut as a piano 
wire. Every ten minutes one of 
the technicians made a chalk 
mark on the bar by the mouth 
of the purse. 

Frank Collins filled a pipe and 
puffed nervously. "The way I see 
it," he said, "these beings pried a 
small fourth-dimension hole into 
our universe, and somehow got 
that woman under a suggestive 
trance. They made her collect 
aluminum so they could build a 
bigger opening." 

"But why?" Evanson poured 
coffee out of a thermos. It was 
late, and the whole building was 
silent and deserted except for this 
one lab section. The only noise 
in the room was the whine of the 
winch, straining at the other universe. 

"Who knows? To get more and 
more aluminum ? Whatever the 
reason, they want to get through 
to our universe. Maybe theirs is 
in some danger or other. Hell, 
the reason may be so alien that 
we couldn't possibly understand 
it." 

"But what's the idea of hooking 
onto them?" Evanson's eyes were 
worried. 

"Control. We pull a non-free 
chunk of their universe into ours, 
and they can't use the opening. 
It'll be plugged up. The more we 
pull through, the more strain on 
the structure of their universe. 

47 




They'll have to listen to our 
terms then. They'll have to give 
us their information so that we 
can build openings, and examine 
them properly. If they don't, we'll 
wreck their universe." 

"But you don't even- know what 
they're doing in there!" 

Collins shrugged, made another 
chalk mark on the bar. The bar 
was humming. 

"I don't think we should take 
the risk," Evanson complained. 
"I didn't have permission to try 
this. I just let you go ahead on 
my own authority, on data—" 
he shuddered suddenly — "that's 
so damned vague, it makes no 
sense at all." 

Collins knocked out his pipe 
sharply. "It's all the data we 
have." 

"I say it's wrong. I think we 
should release the bar right now, 
and wait till Chalmers gets iwftf* 
in the morning." 

Collins eyed the winch with 
growing uneasiness, lighting his 
pipe with a match held in unsteady fingers. "We can't release 
the bar now. The tapered sheaves 
are under too much tension. We 
couldn't even burn through that 
rod with an oxy-torch in less than 
twenty minutes — and it would 
jolt the whole building apart 
when it broke." 

"But the danger — " Evanson 
stood up, his forehead beaded 
with perspiration. He nodded to

ward the creaking winch. "You 
might be gambling our whole 
universe." 

"Oh, calm down!" Collins said 
angrily. "We don't have any 
choice now, or even time to talk 
it over. We're doing it and that's 
all there is to it. When you grab 
a tiger by the tail, you've got to 
hang on." 

Evanson crossed the room excitedly. "It seems to me," he said 
tensely, "that the tiger might 
have the advantage. If it went the 
wrong way, think what they 



could do to our universe!" 

Collins blew smoke from the 
corner of his mouth. "At any rate, 
I'm glad we thought of it first — ** 
He trailed off, his face slowly 
turning white. 

Evanson followed his stare, and 
his breath came in a sharp gasp. 
The thermos clattered noisily to 
the floor. He pointed at the second chalk mark, sliding into the 
pocketbook. 

"You mean you hope we did,** 
he said.

Zeritsky's 
Law 

Why bother building a time machine 
when there's something much easier 

to find right in your own kitchen? 



SOMEBODY someday will 
make a study of the influence of animals on history. 
Although not as famous as Mrs. 
O'Leary's cow, Mrs. Graham's 
cat should certainly be included 
in any such study. It has now 
been definitely established that 



the experiences of this cat led 
to the idea of quick-frozen people, 
which, in turn, led to the passage 
of Zeritsky's Law. 

We must go back to the files 
of the Los Angeles newspapers 
for 1950 to find the story. In 
brief, a Mrs. Fred C. Graham 



Illustrated by THORNE 



ZERITSKY'S LAW 



51 



missed her pet cat on the same 
day that she put a good deal of 
food down in her home deepfreeze unit. She suspected ho connection between the two events. 
The cat was not to be found 
until six days later, when its 
owner went to fetch something 
from the deep-freeze. Much as 
she loved her pet, we may imagine 
that she was more horror- than 
grief- stricken at her discoveryShe lifted the little ice-encased 
body out of the deep-freeze and 
set it on the floor. Then she 
managed to run as far as the 
next door neighbor's house before 
fainting. 

Mrs. Graham became hysterical after she was revived, and 
it was several hours before she 
could be quieted enough to persuade anybody that she hadn't 
made up the whole thing. She 
prevailed upon her neighbor to 
go back to the house with her. 
In front of the deep-freeze they 
found a small pool of water, and 
a wet cat, busily licking itself. 
The neighbor subsequently told 
reporters that the cat was concentrating its licking on one of 
its hind legs, where some ice still 
remained, so that she, for one, 
believed the story. 

A follow-up dispatch, published a week later, reported that 
the cat was unharmed by the adventure. Further, Mrs. Graham 
was quoted as saying that the 



cat had had a large meal just 
before its disappearance; that as 
soon after its rescue as it had 
dried itself off, it took a long 
hap, precisely as it always did 
after a meal; and that it was not 
hungry again until evening. It was 
clear from the accounts that the 
life processes had been stopped 
dead in their tracks, and had, 
after defrosting, resumed at exactly the point where they left 
off. 

Perhaps it Is unfair to put all 
the responsibility on one luckless 
cat. Had such a thing happened 
anywhere else in the country, it 
would have been talked about, 
believed by a few, disbelieved by 
most, and forgotten. But as the 
historic kick of Mrs. O'Leary's 
cow achieved significance because 
of the time and place that it was 
delivered, so the falling of Mrs. 
Graham's cat into the deep-freeze 
became significant because it occurred in Los Angeles. There, and 
probably only there, the event 
was anything but forgotten; the 
principles it revealed became the 
basis of a hugely successful business. 

How shall we regard the Zeritsky Brothers? As archvillains or 
pioneers? In support of the latter view, it must be admitted that 
the spirit of inquiry and the willingness to risk the unknown 
were indisputably theirs. However, their pioneering — if we agree 




 



to call it that — was, equally indisputably, bound up with the 
quest for a fast buck. 

Some of their first clients paid 
as high as $15,000 for the initial 
freezing, and the exorbitant rate 
of $1,000 per year as a storage 
charge. The Zeritsky Brothers 
owned and managed one of the 
largest quick-freezing plants in 
the world, and it was their claim 
that converting the freezing 
equipment and storage facilities 
to accommodate humans was extremely expensive, hence the high 
rates. 

When the early clients who 
paid these rates were defrosted 
years later, and found other clients receiving the same services 
for as little as $3,000, they threatened a row and the Zeritskys 
made substantial refunds. By that 
time they could easily afford it, 
and since any publicity about 
their enterprise was unwelcome 
to them, all refunds were made 
without a whimper. $3,000 became the standard rate, with $100 
per year the storage charge, and 
no charge for defrosting. 

The Zeritskys were businessmen, first and last. Anyone who 
had the fee could put himself 
away for whatever period of time 
he wished, and no questions 
asked. The ironclad rule that full 
payment must be made in advance was broken only once, as 
far as the records show. 



A certain young man had a 
very wealthy uncle, residing in 
Milwaukee, whose heir he was, 
but the uncle was not getting 
along in years fast enough. The 
young man, then 18 years old, 
did not wish to waste the "best 
years of his life" as a poor boy. 
He wanted the money while he 
was young, but his uncle was as 
healthy as he was wealthy. The 
Zeritskys were the obvious miswer 
to his problem. 

The agreement between them 
has been preserved. They undertook to service the youth without advance payment. They further undertook to watch the Milwaukee papers until the d< mise 
of the uncle should be reported, 
whereupon they would defrost 
the hoy. In exchange for this, 
the youth, thinking of course that 
money would be no object when 
he came out, agreed to pay 
double. 

The uncle lived 17 years longer, 
during which time he seems to 
have forgotten his nephew and 
to have become deeply interested 
in a mystic society, to which he 
left his entire fortune. The Zeritskys duly defrosted the boy. and 
whether they or he were the more 
disappointed is impossible to 
imagine. They never forgot the 
lessfld, and never made another 
exception to their rule* 

He, poor fellow, spent the rest 
of his life, including the best 



ZERITSKYS LAW 



years, paying off his debt which, 
at $3,000 plus 17 years at $100 
per year, and the whole doubled, 
amounted to $9,400. The books 
record his slow but regular payments over the next 43 years, and 
indicate that he had only $250 
left to pay when he died. We 
may, I think, assume that various 
underworld characters who were 
grateful ex-clients of the Zeritskys 
were instrumental in persuading 
the boy to keep up his payments. 

Criminals were the first to 
apply for quick-freezing, and 
formed the mainstay of the Zeritskys' business through the years. 
What more easy than to rob, hide 
the loot (except for that all-important advance payment), present yourself to the Zeritskys and 
remain in their admirable chambers for five or ten years, emerge 
to find the hue and cry long since 
died down and the crime forgotten, recover your haul and 
live out your life in luxury? 

Due to the shady character of 
most of their patrons, the Zeritskys kept all records by a system of numbers. Names never 
appeared on the books, and anonimity was guaranteed. 

Law enforcement agents, looking for fugitives from justice, 
found no way to break down this 
system, nor any law which they 
could interpret as making it illegal to quick-freeze. Perhaps the 
truth is that they did not search 



too diligently for a law that could 
be made to apply. As long as the 
Zeritskys kept things quiet and 
did not advertise or attract public 
attention, they could safely continue their bizarre business. 

City officials of Los Angeles, 
and particularly members of the 
police force, enjoyed a period of 
unparalleled prosperity. Lawyers 
and other experts who thought 
they were on the track of legal 
means by which to liquidate the 
Zeritsky empire found themselves 
suddenly able to buy a ranch or 
a yacht or both, and retire forever from the arduous task of 
earning a living. 

Even with a goodly part of 
the population of Los Angeles as 
permanent pensioners, the Zeritsky fortune grew to incredible 
proportions. By the time the 
Zeritsky Brothers died and left 
the business to their sons, it was 
a gold mine, and an inexhaustible 
one at that. 

During these later years, the 
enterprise began to attract a 
somewhat better class of people. 
Murderers and other criminals 
continued to furnish the bulk of 
the business, but as word of this 
amazing service seeped through 
the country, others began to see 
in it an easy way of solving their 
problems. They were encouraged, 
too, by the fact that the process 
was painless, and the firm completely reliable. There were no 



64 




 



risks, no accidents, no fatalities. 
One could, in short, have confidence in the Zeritskys. 

Soon after Monahan's great exposure rocked the nation, however, many of these better-type 
clients leaped into print to tell 
their experiences. 

One of the most poignant stories came from the daughter of 
a Zeritsky client. Her father was 
still, at the age of one hundred 
and two, passionately interested 
in politics, but the chances of 
his lasting until the next election 
were not good. The daughter herself suggested the deep freeze, 
and he welcomed the idea. He 
decided on a twenty year stay 
because, in his own words, "If 
the Republicans can't get into 
the White House in twenty years, 
1 give up." Upon his return, he 
found that his condition had not 
been fulfilled. His daughter described him. as utterly baffled by 
the new world. He lived in it 
just a week before he left it, 
this time for good. She states his 
last words were, "How do you 
people stand it?" 

Some professional people patronized the Zeritskys, chiefly 
movie stars. After the expose, fan 
magazines were filled with accounts of how the stars had kept 
youthful. The more zealous ones 
had prolonged their screen lives 
for years by the simple expedient 
of storing themselves away be


tween pictures. We may imagine 
the feelings of their public upon 
discovering that the seemingly 
eternal youth of their favorites 
was due to the Zeritskys and not, 
as they had been led to believe, 
to expensive creams, lotions, diet 
and exercise. There was a distinctly unfavorable reaction, and 
the letter columns of the fan magazines bristled with angry charges 
of cheating. 

But next to criminals, the majority of people who applied for 
quick-freezing seems to have been 
husbands or wives caught in insupportable marital situations. 
Their experiences were subsequently written up in the confession magazines. It was usually, 
the husband who fled to Los 
Angeles and incarcerated himself 
for an appropriate number of 
years, at the end of which time 
his unamiable spouse would have 
died or made other arrangements. 
If we can believe the magazines, 
this scheme worked out very well 
in most cases. 

There was, inevitably, one 
spiteful wife who divined her husband's intentions. By shrewd reasoning, she figured approximately 
the number of years he had 
chosen to be absent, and put herself away for a like period. In 
a TV dramatization rather pessimistically entitled You Can't 
Get Away, the husband described 
his sensations upon being de

frosted after 15 years, only to 
find his wife waiting for him, 
right there in the reception room 
of the Zeritsky plant. 

"She was as perfectly preserved 
as I was," he said. "Every irritating habit that had made my 
life unbearable with her was absolutely intact." 

The sins of the fathers may 
be visited on the sons, but how 
often we see repeated the old 
familiar pattern of the sons destroying the lifework of the fathers ! The Zeritsky Brothers were 
fanatically meticulous. They supervised every detail of their 
operations, and kept their records 
with an elaborate system of 
checks and doublechecks. They 
were shrewd enough to realize 
that complete dependability was 
essential to their business. A satisfied Zeritsky client was a silent 
client. One dissatisfied client 
would be enough to blow the 
business apart. 

The sons, in their greed, overexpanded to the point where they 
could not, even among the four 
of them, personally supervise 
each and every detail. A fatal 
mistake was bound to occur 
sooner or later. When it did, the 
victim broadcast his grievance to 
the world. 

The story appeared in a national magazine, every copy of 
which was sold an hour after it 
appeared on the stands. Under 



the title They Put the Freeze on 
Me! John A. Monahan told his 
tragic tale. At the age of 37, he 
had fallen desperately in love 
with a girl of 16. She was immature and frivolous and wanted to 
"play around" a little more before she settled down. 

"She told me," he wrote, "to 
come back in five years, and that 
started me thinking. In five years 
I'd be 42, and what would a girl 
of 21 want with a man twice as 
old as her?" 

John Monahan moved in circles where the work of the Zeritskys was well known. Not only 
did he see an opportunity of being 
still only 37 when his darling 
reached 21, but he foresaw a painless way of passing the years 
which he must endure without 
her. Accordingly, he presented 
himself for the deep-freeze, paid 
his $3,000 and the $500 storage 
charge in advance, and left, he 
claimed, "written instructions to 
let me out in five years, so there'd 
be no mistakes." 

Nobody knows how the slip 
happened, but somehow John A, 
Monahan, or rather the number 
assigned to him, was entered on 
the books for 25 years instead of 
five years. Upon being defrosted, 
and discovering that a quarter of 
a century had elapsed, his rage 
was awesome. Along with everything else, his love for his 
sweetheart had been perfectly 




 



preserved, but she had given up 
waiting for him and was a happy 
mother of two boys and six girls. 

Monahan's accusation that the 
Zeritskys had "ruined his life" 
may be taken with a grain of 
salt. He was still a young man, 
and the rumor that he received 
a hundred thousand for the magazine rights to his story was true. 

As most readers are aware, 
what has come to be known as 
"Zeritsky's Law" was passed by 
Congress and signed by the President three days after Monahan's 
story broke. 

Seventy -five years after Mrs. 
Graham's cat fell into the freezer, 
it became the law of the land 
that the mandatory penalty for 
anyone applying quick-freezing 
methods to any living thing, human or animal, Was death. Also, 
all quick-frozen people were to 



be defrosted immediately. 

Los Angeles papers reported 
that beginning on the day Monahan's story appeared, men by the 
thousands poured into the city. 
They continued to come, choking 
every available means of transport, for the next two days — until, 
that is, Zeritsky's Law went 
through. 

When we consider the date, and 
remember that due to the gravity 
of the international situation, a 
bill had just been passed drafting 
all men from 16 to 60, we realize 
why Congress had to act. 

The Zeritskys, of course, were 
among the first to be taken. Because of their experience, they 
were put in charge of a military 
warehouse for dehydrated foods, 
and warned not to get any ideas 
for a new business.

WELL, here I am at 
Princeton, ifacs is quite 
a place, quite a place, 
but the atmosphere's darned informal. My colleagues seem to 
be mostly youngish fellows 
dressed in sloppy dungarees, 
sweatshirts (the kind Einstein 
made so famous) and moccasins, 



and when they're not puttering in 
the labs they're likely to be lolling on the grass, lounging in front 
of the fire in commons, or slouching around in conference rooms 
chalking up equations on a blackboard. No way of telling, of 
course, but a lot of these collegiate-looking chaps must be in the 
ms end, whatever that is. You'd

like that would dress and behave 
with a little more dignity. 

Guess I was a little previous 
in packing my soup -and -fish. 
Soon as I was shown to my room 
in the bachelor dorms, I dug it 
out and hung it way back in the 
closet, out of sight. When in 
Rome, etc. Later that day I discovered they carry dungarees in 
the Co-op; luckily, they had the 
pre-faded kind. 

October 6, 1959 

"VTET the boss this morning — 
hardly out of his thirties, 
crew-cut, wearing a flannel hunting shirt and dirty saddleshoes. 
I was glad I'd thought to change 
into my dungarees before the interview. 

"Parks," he said, "you can 
count yourself a very fortunate 
young man. You've come to the 
most important address in America, not excluding the Pentagon. 
In the world, probably. To get 
you oriented, suppose I sketch 
in some of the background of 
the place.*' 

That would be most helpful, I 
said. I wondered, though, if he 
was as naive as he sounded. EMd 
he think I'd been working in 
cybernetics labs for going on six 
years without hearing enough rumors about ifacs to make me 
dizzy? Especially about the MS 
end of if ACS? 



"Maybe you know,** he went 
on, "that in the days of Oppenheimer and Einstein, this place 
was called the Institute for Advanced Studies. It was run pretty 
loosely then — in addition to the 
mathematicians and physicists, 
they had all sorts of queer ducks 
hanging around — poets, egyptologists, numismatists, medievalists, 
herbalists, God alone knows what 
all. By 1955, however, so many 
cybernetics labs had sprung up 
around the country that we 
needed some central coordinating 
agency, so Washington arranged 
for us to take over here. Naturally, as soon as we arrived, we 
eased out the poets and egyptologists, brought in our own people, 
and changed the name to the Institute for Advanced Cybernetics 
Studies. We've got some pretty 
keen projects going now, prer-ty 
keen." 

I said I'd bet, and did he have 
any idea which project I would 
fit into? 

"Sure thing," he said. "You're 
going to take charge of a very 
important lab. The Pro lab." I 
guess he saw my puzzled look. 
"Pro — that's short for prosthetics, 
artificial limbs. You know, it's 
really a scandal. With our present 
level of technology, we should 
have artificial limbs which in 
many ways are even better than 
the originals, but actually we're 
still making do with modifies 


60 




 



tions of the same primitive, 
clumsy pegs and hooks they were 
using a thousand years ago. I'm 
counting on you to get things 
hopping in that department. It's 
a real challenge." 

I said it sure was a challenge, 
and of course I'd do my level best 
to meet it. Still, I couldn't help 
feeling a bit disappointed. Around 
cybernetics circles, I hinted, you 
heard a lot of talk about the 
hush-hush ms work that was going on at ifacs and it sounded 
so exciting that, well, a fellow 
sort of hoped he might get into 
that end of things. 

"Look here, Parks," the boss 
said. He seemed a little peeved, 
"Cybernetics is teamwork, and 
the first rule of any team is that 
not everybody can be quarterback. Each man has a specific 
job on our team, one thing he's 
best suited for, and what you're 
best suited for, obviously, is the 
Pro lab. We've followed your 
work closely these last few years, 
and we were quite impressed by 
the way you handled those photoelectric-cell insects. You pulled 
off a brilliant engineering stunt, 
you know, when you induced 
nervous breakdown in your robot 
moths and bedbugs, and proved 
that the oscillations they developed corresponded to those which 
the human animal develops in 
intention tremor and Parkinson's 
disease. A keen bit of cybernetic 



thinking, that. Very keen." 

It was just luck, I told him 
modestly. 

"Nonsense," the boss insisted. 
"You're first and foremost a talented neuro man, and that's exactly what we need in the Pro 
department. There, you see, the 
problem is primarily one of duplicating a nervous mechanism in 
the metal, of bridging the gap 
between the neuronic and electronic. So buckle down, and if 
you hear any more gossip about 
ms, forget it fast — it's not a 
proper subject of conversation 
for you. The loyalty oath you 
signed is very specific about the 
trouble you can get into with 
loose talk. Remember that." 

I said I certainly would, and 
thanks a whole lot for the advice. 

Damn! Everybody knows MS 
is the thing to get into. It gives 
you real standing in the field if 
it gets around that you're an ms 
man. I had my heart set on getting into MS.

went with them, and as we were 
walking along the trail Goldweiser, my assistant, told me the 
idea behind these expeditions. 

"You can't get away from it," 
he said. "e=mc 3 is in a tree trunk 
as well as in a uranium atom 
or a solar system. When you're 
hacking away at a particular tree, 
though, you don't think much 
about such intangibles — like any 
good, untheoretical lumberjack, 
you're a lot more concerned with 
superficialities, such as which way 
the grain runs, how to avoid the 
knots, and so on. It's very restful. So long as a cyberneticist is 
sawing and chopping, he's not 
a sliver of uncontaminated cerebrum contemplating the eternal 
slippery verities of gravity and 
electromagnetism : he's just one 
more guy trying to slice up one 
more log. Makes him feel he belongs to the human race again. 
Einstein, you know, used to get 
the same results with a violin." 

Now, I've heard talk like that 
before, and I don't like it. I don't 
like it at all. It so happens that 
I feel very strongly on the subject. I think a scientist should 
like what he's doing and not want 
to take refuge in Nature from 
the Laws of Nature (which is 
downright illogical, anyhow). I, 
for one, enjoy cutting logs precisely because, when my saw 
rasps across a knot, I know that 
the innermost secret of that knot. 



as of all matter in the "Universe, 
is e=mc 2 . It's my job to know 
it, and if s very satisfying to know 
that I know it and that the general run of people don't. I was 
about to put this thought into 
words, but before I could open 
my mouth, somebody behind us 
spoke up. 

"Bravo, Goldie," he said. "Let 
us by all means pretend that we 
belong to the human race. Make 
way for the new cyberneticists 
with their old saws. Cyberneticist, 
spare that tree!" 

I turned around to see who 
could be making jokes in such 
bad taste and — as I might have 
guessed — it was Len Ellsom. He 
was just as surprised as I was. 

"Well," he said, "if it isn't Ollie Parks! I thought you were out 
in Cal Tech, building schizophrenic bedbugs." 

After M. i. T. I had spent some 
time out in California doing 
neuro-cyber research, I explained 
— but what was he doing here? I'd 
lost track of him after he'd left 
Boston; the last I'd heard, he'd 
been working on the giant robot 
brain Remington -Rand was developing for the Air Force. I remembered seeing his picture in 
the paper two or three times 
while he was working on the 
brain. 

"I was with Remington a couple of years,'* he told me. "If I 
do say so myself, we built the

Air Force a real humdinger of 
a brain — in addition to solving 
the most complex problems in 
ballistics, it could whistle Dixie 
and, in moments of stress, produce a sound not unlike a Bronx 
cheer. Naturally, for my prowess 
in the electronic simulation of 
I.Q., I was tapped for the brain 
department of these hallowed 
precincts." 

"Oh?" I said. "Does that mean 
you're in ms?" It wasn't an easy 
idea to accept, but I think I was 
pretty successful in keeping my 
tone casual. 

"Ollie, my boy," he said in an 
exaggerated stage whisper, putting his finger to his lips, "in the 
beginning was the word and the 
word was mum. Leave us avoid 
the subject of brains in this keen 
place. We all have a job to do 
on the team." I suppose that was 
meant to be a humorous imitation of the boss; Len always did 
fancy himself quite a clown. 

We were separated during the 
sawing, but he caught up with 
me on the way back and said, 
"Let's get together soon and have 
a talk, Ollie. It's been a long 
time." 

He wants to talk about Marilyn, I suppose. Naturally. He has 
a guilty conscience. I'll have to 
make it quite clear to him that 
the whole episode is a matter of 
complete indifference to me. Marilyn is a closed book in my life; 



he must understand that. But can 
you beat that? He's right in the 
middle of ms! That lad certainly 
gets around. It's the usual Ellsom charm, I suppose. 

The usual Ellsom technique for 
irritating people, too. He's stilt 
trying to get my goat; he knows 
how much I've always hated to 
be called Ollie. Must watch Goldweiser. Thought he laughed 
pretty heartily at Len's wisecracks. 

October 18, 1959 

THINGS are shaping up in the 
Pro lab. Here's how I get 
the picture. 

A year ago, the boss laid down 
a policy for the lab : begin with 
legs because, while the neuromotor systems in legs and arms 
are a lot alike, those in legs are 
much simpler. If we build satisfactory legs, the boss figures, w« 
can then tackle arms; the main 
difficulties will have been licked. 

Well, last summer, in line with' 
this approach, the Army picked 
out a double amputee from the 
outpatient department of Walter 
Reed Hospital — fellow by the 
name of Kujack, who lost both 
his legs in a land mine explosion 
outside Pyongyang — and shipped 
him up here to be a subject i* 
our experiments. 

When Kujack arrived, the 
neuro boys made a major dec**

sion. Tt didn't make sense, they 
agreed, to keep building experimental legs directly into the 
muscles and nerves of Kujack's 
stumps ; the surgical procedure 
m these cine-plastic jobs is complicated as all getout, involves a 
lot of pain for the subject and, 
what's more to the point, means 
long delays each time while the 
tissues heal. 

Instead, they hit on the idea 
of integrating permanent metal 
and plastic sockets into the 
stumps, so constructed that each 
new experimental limb can be 
snapped into place whenever it's 
ready for a trial. 

By the time I took over, two 
weeks ago, Goldweiser had the 
sockets worked out and fitted to 
Kujack's stumps, and the muscular and neural tissues had knitted satisfactorily. There was only 
one hitch : twenty-three limbs 
had been designed, and all 
twenty- three had been dismal 
flops. That's when the boss called 
me in. 

There's no mystery about the 
failures. Not to me, anyhow. 
Cybernetics is simply the science 
of building machines that will 
duplicate and improve on the 
organs and functions of the animal, based on what we know 
about the systems of communication and control in the animal. All 
right. But in any particular cybernetics project, everything de


pends on just how many of the 
functions you want to duplicate, 
just how much of the total organ 
you want to replace. 

That's why the robot -brain 
boys can get such quick and 
spectacular results, have their 
pictures in the papers all the 
time, and become the real glamor 
boys of the profession. They're 
not asked to duplicate the human 
brain in its entirety — all they 
have to do is isolate and imitate 
one particular function of the 
brain, whether it's a simple operation in mathematics or a certain 
type of elementary logic. 

The robot brain called the 
Eniac, for example, is exactly 
what its name implies — an Electronic Numerical Integrator and 
Computer, and it just has to be 
able to integrate and compute 
figures faster and more accurately 
than the human brain can. It 
doesn't have to have daydreams 
and nightmares, make wisecracks, 
suffer from anxiety, and all that. 
What's more, it doesn't even have 
to look like a brain or fit into the 
tiny space occupied by a real 
brain. It can be housed in a sixstory building and look like an 
overgrown typewriter or an automobile dashboard or even a pogo 
stick. All it has to do is tell you 
that two times two equals four, 
and tell you fast. 

When you're told to build an 
artificial leg that'll take the place 



64 




 



of a real one, the headaches begin. Your machine must not only 
look like its living model, it must 
a/so balance and support, walk, 
run, hop, skip, jump, etc., etc. 
Also, it must fit into the same 
space. it must feel every
thing a real leg feels — touch, heat, 
cold, pain, moisture, kinesthetic 
sensations — as well as execute all 
the brain - directed movements 
that a real leg can. 

So you're not duplicating this 
or that function ; you're reconstructing the organ in its totality, 
or trying to. Your pro must have 
a full set of sensory-motor communication systems, plus machines to carry out orders, which 
is impossible enough to begin 
with. 

But our job calls for even more. 
The pro mustn't only equal the 
real thing, it must be superior! 
That means creating a synthetic 
neuro-muscular system that actually improves on the nerves and 
muscles Nature created in the 
original! 

When our twenty-fourth experimental model turned out to 
be a dud last week — it just hung 
from Kujack's stump, quivering 
like one of my robot bedbugs, 
as though it had a bad case of 
intention tremor — Goldweiser 
said something that made an impression on me. 

"They don't want much from 
us," he, said sarcastically. "They 



just want us to be God." 

I didn't care for his cynical 
attitude at all, but he had a 
point. Len Ellsom just has to 
build a fancy adding machine 
to get his picture in the papers. 
/ have to be God! 

October 22, 1959 

rvON'T know what to make 
" of Kujack. His attitude is 
peculiar. Of course, he's very cooperative, lies back on the fitting 
table and doesn't even wince 
when we snap on the pros, and 
he does his best to carry out instructions. Still, there's something 
funny about the way he looks at 
me. There's a kind of malicious 
expression in his eyes. At times, 
come to think of it, he reminds 
me of Len. 

Take this afternoon, for in- « 
stance. I've just worked out an 
entirely different kind of leg 
based on a whole new arrangement of solenoids to duplicate 
the muscle systems, and I decided to give it a try. When I 
was slipping the model into place, 
I looked up and caught Kujack's 
eye for a moment. He seemed to 
be laughing at something, although his face was expressionless. 

"All right," I said. "Let's make 
a test. I understand you used to 
be quite a football player. Well, 
just think of how you used to 



SELF PORTRAIT 



kick a footbalt and try to do it 

now." 

He really seemed to be trying; 
the effort made him sweat. All 
that happened, though, was that 
the big toe wriggled a little and 
the knee buckled. Dud Number 
Twenty-five, I was sore, of course, 
especially when I noticed that 
Kujack was more amused than 
ever. 

"You seem to think something's 
pretty funny," I said. 

"Don't get me wrong, Doc," 
he said, much too innocently. 
"It's just that I've been thinking. 
Maybe you'd have more luck if 
you thought of me as a bedbug." 

"Where did you get that idea?" 

"From Doc Ellsom. I was having some beers with him the other 
night. He's got a very high opinion of you, says you build the 
best bedbugs in the business." 

I find it hard to believe that 
Len Ellsom would say anything 
really nice about me. Must be 
his guilt about Marilyn that 
makes him talk that way. I don't 
like his hanging around Kujack. 

October 25, 1959 

rw^HE boss came along on our 
J- woodcutting expedition this 
morning and volunteered to work 
the other end of my two-handled 
saw. He asked how things were 
coming in the Pro lab. 

"As I see it," I said, "there 




*6 




 




are two sides to the problem, the 
kinesthetic and the neural. We're 
making definite progress on the 
K side — I've worked out a new 
solenoid system, with some miniature motors tied in, and I think 
it'll give us a leg that moves 
damned well. I don't know about 
the N side, though. It's pretty 
tough figuring out how to hook 
the thing up electrically with the 
central nervous system so that 
the brain can control it. Some 
sort of compromise system of 
operation, along mechanical 
rather than neural lines, would 
be a lot simpler." 

"You mean," the boss said with 
a smile, "that it's stumping you." 

I was relieved to see him taking it so well because I know 
how anxious he is to get results 
from the Pro lab. Since Pro is 
one of the few things going on 
at ipacs that can be talked about, 
he's impatient for us to come up 
with something he can release to 
the press. As the public relations 
officer explained it to me at dinner the other night, people get 
worried when they know there's 
something like ifacs going, but 
don't get any real information 
about it, so the boss, naturally, 
wants to relieve the public's curiosity with a good, reassuring story 
about our work. 

I knew I was taking an awful 
chance spilling the whole K-N 
thing to him the way I did, but 



SflP PORTRAIT 



47 



I had to lay the groundwork for 
a little plan I've just begun to 
work on. 

"By the way, sir," I said, "I 
ran into Len Ellsom the other 
day. I didn't, know he was here." 

"Do you know him?" the boss 
said. "Good man. One of the best 
brains -and -games men you'll find 
anywhere," 

I explained that Len had gotten his degree at m.i.t. the year 
before I did. From what I'd 
heard, I added, he'd done some 
important work on the Remington-Rand ballistics computer. 

"He did indeed," the boss said, 
"but that's not the half of it. 
After that he made some major 
contributions to the robot chess 
player. As a matter of fact, that's 
why he's here." 

I said I hadn't heard about the 
chess player. 

"As soon as it began to play 
a really good game of chess, 
Washington put the whole thing 
under wraps for security reasons. 
Which is why you won't hear any 
more about it from me." 

I'm no Eniac, but I can occasionally put two and two together 
myself. If the boss's . remarks 
mean anything, they mean that 
ah electronic brain capable of 
playing .games has been developed, atv\ that it's led to something important- militarily. Of 
course! I could kick myself for 
■not having guessed it before. 

68 



Brains -and-games — that's what 
MS is all about, obviously. It had 
to happen: out of the mathematical analysis of chess came a robot 
chess player, and out of the chess 
player came some kind of mechanical brain that's useful in 
military strategy. That's what 
Len Ellsom's in. the middle of. 

"Really brilliant mind," the 
boss said after we'd sawed for 
a while. "Keen. But he's a little 
erratic — quirky, queer sense of 
humor. Isn't that your impression?" 

"Definitely," I said. "I'd be the 
last one in the world to say a 
word against Len, but he was always a little peculiar. Very gay 
one moment and very sour the 
next, and inclined to poke fun 
at things other people take seriously. He used to write poetry." 

"I'm very glad to know that,'* 
the boss said. "Confirms my own 
feeling about him." 

So the boss has some doubta 
about Len. 

Octooer 27, 1959 

UNPLEASANT evening with 
Len. It all started after dinner when he showed up in my 
room, wagged his finger at me 
and said, "Ollie, you've been 
avoiding me. That hurts. 
Thought we were pals, thick and 
thin and till debt and death do 
us part." 

} A I A X y SCIENCE FICTION 



I saw immediately that he was 
drunk — he always gets his words 
mixed up when he's drunk- — and 
I tried to placate him by explaining that it wasn't anything 
like that; I'd been busy. 

"If we're pals," he said, "come 
on and have a beer with me." 

There was no shaking him off, 
so I followed him down to his 
car and we drove to this sleazy 
little bar in the Negro part of 
town. As soon as we sat down 
in a booth, Len borrowed all the 
nickels I had, put them in the 
jukebox and pressed the levers 
for a lot of old Louie Armstrong 
records. 

"Sorry, kid," he said. "I know 
how you hate this real jazzy stuff, 
but can't have a reunion without 
music, and there isn't a polka 
or cowboy ballad or hillbilly 
stomp in the box. They lack the 
folksy touch on this side of the 
tracks." Len has always been very 
snobbish about my interest in 
folk music. 

I asked him what he'd been 
doing during the day. 

"Lushing it up," he said. "Getting stinking from drinking." He 
still likes to use the most flamboyant slang; I consider it an 
infantile form of protest against 
what he regards as the "genteel" 
manner of academic people. "I 
got sort of restless this morning, 
so I ducked out and beat it into 
New York and looked up my 



friend Steve Lundy in the Village. Spent the afternoon liquidating our joint assets. Liquidating our assets in the joints." 

What, I wanted to know, was 
he feeling restless about? 

"Restless for going on three 
years now." His face grew solemn, as though he were thinking 
it over very carefully. "I'll amend 
that statement. Hell with the 
Aesopian language. I've been a 
plain lush for going on three 
years. Ever since — " 

If it was something personal—* 
I suggested. 

"It is nor something personal," 
he said, mimicking me. "G". i»s I 
can tell an old cyberneticist pal 
about it. Been a lush for three 
years because I've been scared 
for three years. Been scared for 
three years because three years 
ago I saw a machine beat a man 
at a game of chess." 

A machine that plays chess? 
That was interesting, I said. 

"Didn't tell you the whole truth 
the other day," Len mumbled. "I 
did work on. the Remington-Rand 
computer, sure, but I didn't come 
to ifacs directly from that. In 
between I spent a couple years 
at the Bell Telephone Labs. 
Claude Shannon— or, rather, to 
begin with there was Norbert 
Wiener back at M.I.T.— it's complicated . . ." 

"Look," I said, "are you sure 
you want to talk about it?" 



SELF PORTRAIT

"Stop wearing your loyalty 
oath on your sleeve," he said belligerently. "Sure I want to talk 
about it. Greatest subject I know. 
Begin at the beginning. Whole 
thing started back in the Thirties 
with those two refugee mathematicians who used to be here at 
the Institute for Advanced Studies when Einstein was around. 
Von Morgan and Neumanstern, 
no, Von JVeumann and Morganstern. You remember, they did a 
mathematical analysis of all the 
possible kinds of games, pokef, 
tossing pennies, chess, bridge, 
everything, and they wrote up 
their findings in a volume you 
certainly know, The Theory of 
Games. 

"Well, that got Wiener started. 
You may remember that when 
he founded the science of cybernetics, he announced that on the 
basis of the theory of games, it 
was feasible to design a robot 
computing machine that would 
play a better than average* game 
of chess. Right after that, back 
in '49 or maybe it was *50, Claude 
Shannon of the Bell Labs said 
Wiener wasn't just talking, and 
to prove it he was going to build 
the robot chess player. Which he 
proceeded withforth — forthwith — 
to do. Sometime in '53, I was 
taken off the Remington-Rand 
project and assigned to Bell to 
work with him." 

"Maybe we ought to start 



back," I cut in. "I've got a lot 
of work to do." 

"The night is young," he said, 
"and you're so dutiful. Where 
was I? Oh yes, Bell. At first our 
electronic pawn-pusher wasn't so 
hot — it could beat the pants off 
a lousy player, but an expert 
just made it look silly. But we 
kept improving it, see, building 
more and more electronic anticipation and gambit-plotting 
powers into it, and finally, one 
great day in '55, we thought we 
had all the kinks ironed out and 
were ready for the big test. By 
this time, of course, Washington 
had stepped in and taken over 
the whole project. 

"Well, we got hold of Fortunescu, the world's champion chess 
player, sat him down and turned 
the robot loose on him. For four 
hours straight we followed the 
match, with a delegation of big 
brass from Washington, and for 
four hours straight the machine 
trounced Fortunescu every game. 
That was when I began to get 
scared. I went out that night and 
got really loaded." 

What had he been so scared 
about? It seemed to me he should 
have felt happy. 

"Listen, Ollie," he said, "for 
Christ's sake, stop talking like a 
Boy Scout for once in your life." 

If he was going to insult me— 

"No insult intended. Just listen. 
I'm a terrible chess player. Any

five -year -old could chatemeck — 
checkmate — me with his brains 
tied behind his back. But this 
machine which I built, helped 
build, is the champion chess 
player of the world. In other 
words, my brain has given birth 
to a brain which can do things my 
brain could never do. Don't you 
find that terrifying?" 

"Not at all," I said. "You made 
the machine, didn't you? Therefore, no matter what it does, it's 
only an extension of you. You 
should feel proud to have devised 
a powerful new tool." 

"Some tool," he sneered. He 
was so drunk by now that I could 
hardly understand what he was 
saying. "The General Staff boys 
in Washington were all hopped up 
about that little old tool, and 
for a plenty good reason — they 
understood that mechanized warfare is only the most complicated 
game the human race has invented so far, an elaborate form 
of chess which uses the population of the world for pawns and 
the globe for a chessboard. They 
saw, too, that when the game of 
war gets this complex, the job 
of controlling and guiding it becomes too damned involved for 
any number of human brains, no 
matter how nimble. 

"In other words, my beamish 
Boy Scout, modern war needs 
just this kind of strategy tool; 
the General Staff has to be mech


anized along with everything else. 
So the Pentagon boys set up ifacs 
and handed us a top-priority 
cybernetics project: to build a 
superduper chess player that 
could oversee a complicated military maneuver, maybe later a 
whole campaign, maybe ultimately a whole global war. 

"We're aiming at a military 
strategy machine which can digest reports from all the units on 
all the fronts and from moment 
to moment, on the basis of that 
steady stream of information, 
grind out an elastic overall strategy and dictate concrete tactical 
directives to all the units. Wiener 
warned this might happen, and 
he was right. A very nifty tool. 
Never mind how far we've gotten 
with the thing, but I will tell 
you this : I'm a lot more scared 
today than I was three years 
ago." 

So that was the secret of ms! 
The most extraordinary machine 
ever devised by the human mindt 
It was hard to conceal the thrill 
of excitement I felt, even as a 
relative outsider. 

"Why all the jitters?" I said. 
"This could be the most wonderful tool ever invented. It might 
eliminate war altogether." 

Len was quiet for a while, gulping his beer and looking off into 
space. Then he turned to me. 

"Steve Lundy has a cute idea," 
he said. "He was telling me about

it this afternoon. He's a bum, you 
see, but he's got a damned good 
tnind and he's done a lot of reading. Among other things, he's 
smart enough to see that once 
you've got your theory of games 
worked out, there's at least the 
logical possibility of converting 
your Eniac into what he calls an 
Strategy Integrator and Computer. And he's guessed, simply 
from the Pentagon's hush-hush 
policy about it, that that's what 
we're working on here at ifacs. 
So he holds forth on the subject 
of Emsiac, and I listen." 
"What's his idea?" I asked. 
"'He thinks Emsiac might eliminate war, too, but not in the 
.way a Boy Scout might think. 
What he says is that all the industrialized nations must be 
working away like mad on Emsiac, just as they did on the atom 
bomb, so let's assume that before 
long all the big countries will 
have more or less equal ms machines. All right. A cold war gets 
under way between countries A 
and B, and pretty soon it reaches 
the showdown stage: Then both 
countries plug in their Emsiacs 
and let them calculate the date 
on which hostilities should begin. 
If the machines are equally efficient, they'll hit on the same date. 
If there's a slight discrepancy, 
the two countries can work out 
a compromise date by negotiation. 



"The day arrives. A's Emsiac 
is set up in its capital, B's is set 
up in its capital. In each capital 
the citizens gather around their 
strategy machine, the officials 
turn out in high hats and cutaways, there are speeches, pageants, choral singing, mass 
dancing — the ritual can be worked out in advance. Then, at an 
agreed time, the crowds retreat to 
a safe distance and a committee 
of the top cyberneticists appears. 
They climb into planes, take off 
and— this is beautiful — drop all 
their atom bombs and H-bombs 
on the machines. It happens simultaneously in both countries, 
you see. That's the neat part of 
it. The occasion is called International Mushroom Day. 

"Then the cyberneticists in 
both countries go back to their 
vacuum tubes to work on another 
Emsiac, and the nuclear physicists go back to their piles to 
build more atom bombs, and 
when they're ready they have 
another Mushroom Day. One 
Mushroom Day every few years, 
whenever the diplomatic -strategic 
situation calls for it, and nobody 
even fires a B-B gun. Scientific 
war. Isn't it wonderful?" 

BY the time Len finished this 
peculiar speech, I'd finally 
managed to get him out of the 
tavern and back into his car. I 
started to drive him back to the 



f2 




 



Institute, my ears still vibrating 
with the hysterical yelps of Armstrong's trumpet. I'll never for 
the life of me understand what 
Len sees in that kind of music. 
It seems to me such an unhealthy 
sort of expression. 

"Lundy's being plain silly," I 
couldn*t help saying. "What 
guarantee has he got that on your 
Mushroom Day, Country B 
wouldn*t make a great display of 
destroying one Emstac and one 
set of bombs while it had others 
in hiding? It's too great a chance 
for A to take — she might be 
throwing away all her defenses 
and laying herself wide open to 
attack." 

"See what I mean?" Len muttered. "You're a Boy Scout." 
Then he passed out, without saying a word about Marilyn, Hard 
to tell if he sees anything of her 
these days. He does see some 
pretty, peculiar people, though. 
I'd like to know more about this 
Steve Lundy. 

November 2, 1959 

I'VE done it! Today I split up 
the lab into two entirely independent operations, K and N. 
Did it all on my own authority, 
haven't breathed a word about 
it to the boss yet. Here's my line 
of reasoning. 

On the K end, we can get results, and fast: if it's just a mat


ter of building a pro that work* 
like the real leg, regardless of 
what makes it work, it's a cinchBut if it has to be worked by the 
brain, through the spinal cord, 
the job is just about impossible. 
Who knows if we'll ever learn 
enough about neuro tissue to 
build our own physico-chemicoelectrical substitutes for it? 

As I proved in my robot mothl 
and bedbugs, I can work up electronic circuits that seem to duplicate one particular function ofanimal nerve tissue — one robot is 
attracted to light like a moth, 
the other is repelled by light like 
a bedbug — but I don't know how 
to go about duplicating the tissue 
itself in all its functions. And UtH 
til we can duplicate nerve tissue, 
there's no way to provide our 
artificial limbs with a neuromotor system that can be hooked 
up with the central nervous system. The best I can do along 
those lines is ask KUjack to kick 
and get a wriggle of the big toe 
instead. 

So the perspective is clear. Mechanically, kinesthetically, motorically, I can manufacture a 
hell of a fine leg. Neurally, it 
would take decades, centuries 
maybe, to get even a reasonable 
facsimile of the original — and 
maybe it will never happen. It's 
not a project I'd care to devote 
my life to. If Len Ellsom had 
been working on that sort of thing, 



SELF PORTRAIT 



7* 



he wouldn't have gotten his picture in the paper so often, you 
can be sure. 

So, in line with this perspective, I've divided the whole operation into two separate labs, 
K-Pro and N-Pro. I'm taking 
charge of K-Pro myself, since it 
intrigues me more and I've got 
these ideas about using solenoids 
to get lifelike movements. With 
any kind of luck I'll soon have 
a peach of a mechanical limb, 
motor-driven and with its own 
built-in power plant, operated by 
push-button. Before Christmas, I 
hope. 

Got just the right man to take 
over the neuro lab — Goldweiser, 
my assistant. I weighed the thing 
from every angle before I made 
up my mind, since his being 
Jewish makes the situation very 
touchy: some people will be snide 
enough to say I picked him to be 
a potential scapegoat. Well, Goldweiser, no matter what his origins 
may be, is the best neuro man I 
know. 

Of course, personally — although my personal feelings don't 
enter into the picture at all — I am 
just a bit leary of the fellow. 
Have been ever since that first 
log-cutting expedition, when he 
began to talk in such a peculiar 
way about needing to relax and 
then laughed so hard at Len's 
jokes That sort of talk always 
indicates to me a lack of reverence 



for your job: if a thing's worth 
doing at all, etc. 

Of course, I don't mean that 
Goldweiser's cynical attitude has 
anything to do with his being 
Jewish; Len's got the same attitude and he's nor Jewish. Still, 
this afternoon, when I told Goldweiser he's going to head up the 
N-Pro lab, he sort of bowed and 
said, "That's quite a promotion. 
I always did want to be God." 

I didn't like that remark at all. 
If I'd had another neuro man as 
good as he is, I'd have withdrawn 
the promotion immediately. It's 
his luck that I'm tolerant, that's 
all. 

.November 6, 1959 

T UNCH with Len today, at my 
invitation. Bought him several Martinis, then brought up 
Lundy's name and asked who he 
was, he sounded interesting. 

"Steve?" Len said. "I roomed 
with him my first year in New 
York." 

I asked what Steve did, exactly. 

"Reads, mostly. He got into the 
habit back in the 30s, when he 
was studying philosophy at the 
University of Chicago. When the 
Civil War broke out in Spain, he 
signed up with the Lincoln Brigade find went over there to fight, 
but it turned out to be a bad mistake. His reading got him in a 



74 




 



lot of trouble, you see; he'd gotten used to asking all sorts of 
questions, so when the Moscow 
Trials came along, he asked about 
them. Then the N.K.V.D. began 
to pop up all over Spain, and he 
asked about it. 

"His comrades, he discovered, 
didn't like guys who kept asking 
questions. In fact, a couple of 
Steve's friends who had also had 
an inquiring streak were found 
dead at the front, shot in the 
back, and Steve got the idea that 
he was slated for the same treatment. It seemed that people who 
asked questions were called saboteurs, Trotskyite-Fascists or something, and they kept dying at an 
alarming rate." 

I ordered another Martini for 
Len and asked how Steve had 
managed to save himself. 

"He beat it across the mountains into France," Len explained. 
"Since then he's steered clear of 
causes. He goes to sea once in a 
while to make a few bucks, drinks 
a lot, reads a lot, asks some of the 
shrewdest questions I know. If 
he's anything you can put a label 
on, I'd say- he was a touch of 
Rousseau, a touch of Tolstoi , 
plenty of Voltaire. Come to think 
of it,* a touch of Norbert Wiener 
too. Wiener, you may remember, 
used to ask some damned iconoclastic questions for a cyberneticist. Steve knows Wiener's books 
by heart." 



Steve sounded like a very colorful fellow, I suggested, 

"Yep," Len said. "Marilyn used 
to think so." I don't think I 
moved a muscle when he said it; 
the smile didn't leave my face. 
"Ollie," Len went on, "I've been 
meaning to speak to you about 
Marilyn. Now that the subject's 
come up — " 

"I've forgotten all about it," I 
assured him. 

"I still want to set you 
straight," he insisted. "It must 
have looked funny, me moving 
down to New York after commencement and Marilyn giving 
up her job in the lab and following two days later. But never 
mind how it looked. I never made 
a pass at her all that time in 
Boston, Ollie. That's the truth. 
But she was a screwy, scatterbrained dame and she decided she 
was stuck on me because I dabbled in poetry and hung around 
with artists and such in the Village, and she thought it was all so 
glamorous. I didn't have anything 
to do with her chasing down to 
New York, no kidding. You two 
were sort of engaged, weren't 
you?" 

"It really doesn't matter," I 
said. "You don't have to explain." 
I finished my drink. "You say 
she knew Lundy?" 

"Sure, she knew Lundy. She 
also knew Kram, Rossard, Broyold, Boster, De Kroot and Havre. 



SELF PORTRAIT 



7$ 



She knew a whole lot of guys before she was through." 

"She always was sociable.'* 

"You don't get my meaning," 
Len said. "I am not talking about 
Marilyn's gregarious impulses. 
Listen. First she threw herself at 
me, but I got tired of her. Then 
she threw herself at Steve and he 
got tired of her. Damn near the 
whole male population of the Village got tired of her in the next 
couple years." 

"Those were troubled times. 
The war and all." 

"They were troubled times," 
Len agreed, "and she was the 
source of a fair amount of the 
trouble. You were well rid of her, 
Ollie, take my word for it. God 
save us from the intense Boston 
female who goes bohemian — the 
icicle parading as the torch." 

"Just as a matter of academic 
curiosity," I said as we were leaving, "what became of her?" 

"I don't know for sure. During 
her Village phase she decided her 
creative urge was hampered by 
compasses and T-squares, and in 
between men she tried to do a bit 
of painting — very abstract, very 
imitative-original, very hammy. I 
heard later that she finally gave 
up the self-expression kick, 
moved up to the East Seventies 
somewhere. If I remember, she 
got a job do! ig circuit designing 
on some project for I.B.M." 

"She's .probably doing well at 



it," I said. "She certainly knew 
her drafting. You know, she 
helped lay out the circuits for the 
first robot bedbug I ever built." 

November 19, 1959 

¥>IG step forward, if it isn*t unseemly to use a phrase like 
that in connection with Pro research. This afternoon we completed the first two experimental 
models of my self-propelled 
solenoid legs, made of transparent plastic so everything is 
visible — solenoids, batteries, motors, thyratron tubes and transistors. 

Kujack was waiting in the fitting room to give them their first 
tryout, but when I got there J 
found Len sitting with him. Theie 
were several empty beer cavs 
the floor and they were aabbi"j£ 
away a mile a minute. 

Len knows how I hate to see 
people drinking during working 
hours. When I put the pros down 
and began to rig them for fitting, 
he said conspiratorially, "Shall 
we tell him?" 

Kujack was pretty crocked, too. 
"Let's tell him," he whispered 
back. Strange thing about Kujack, he hardly ever says a word 
to me, but he never closes his 
mouth when Len's around. 

"All right," Len said. "You tell 
him. Tell him how we're going 
to bring peace on Earth and good

will toward bedbugs." 

"We just figured it out," Kujack said. "What's wrong with 
war. It's a steamroller." 

"Steamrollers are very undemocratic," Len added. "Never 
consult people on how they like 
to be flattened before flattening 
them. They just go rolling along." 

"Just go rolling, they go on 
rolling along," Kujack said. "Like 
Old Man River." 

"What's the upshot?" Len demanded. "People get upshot, shot 
up. In all countries, all of them 
without exception, they emerge 
from the war spiritually flattened, 
a little closer to the insects — like 
the hero in that Kafka story who 
wakes up one morning to find he's 
a bedbug, I mean beetle. All because they've been steamrolled. 
Nobody consulted them." 

"Take the case of an amputee," 
Kujack said. "Before the land 
mine exploded, it didn't stop and 
say, 'Look, friend, I've got to go 
off ; that's my job. Choose which 
part you'd prefer to have blown 
off — arm, leg, ear, nose, or whathave-you. Or is there somebody 
else around who would relish being clipped more than you would? 
If so, just send him along. I've got 
to do some clipping, you see, but 
it doesn't matter much which part 
of which guy I clip, so long as I 
make my quota.' Did the land 
mine say that? No! The victim 
wasn't consulted. Consequently 



he can feel victimized, full o 
self-pity. We just worked it out.' 

"The whole thing," Len said. 
"If the population had been 
polled according to democratic 
procedure, the paraplegia and 
other maimings could have been 
distributed to each according to 
his psychological need. See the 
point? Marx corrected by Freud, 
as Steve Lundy would say. Distribute the injuries to each according to his need — not his economic need, but his masochistic 
need. Those with a special taste 
for self -damage obviously should 
be allowed a lion*s share of it. 
That way nobody could claim 
he'd been victimized by the 
steamroller or got anything he 
didn't ask for. It's all on a voluntary basis, you see. Democratic." 

"Whole new concept of war," 
Kujack agreed. "Voluntary amputeeism, voluntary paraplegia, 
voluntary everything else that 
usually happens to people in a 
war. Just to get some human 
dignity back into the thing." 

"Here's how it works," Len 
went on. "Country A and Country B reach the breaking point. 
It's all over but the shooting. All 
right. So they pool their best 
brains, mathematicians, actuaries, 
strategists, logistics geniuses, and 
alt. What am I saying? They 
pool their best robot brains, their 
Emsiacs. In a matter of seconds

they figure out, down to the last 
decimal point, just how many 
casualties each side can be expected to suffer in dead and 
wounded, and then they break 
down the figures. Of the wounded, 
they determine just how many 
will lose eyes, how many arms, 
how many legs, and so on down 
the line. Now — here's where it 
gets really neat — each country, 
having established its quotas in 
dead and wounded of all categories, can send out a call for 
volunteers." 

"Less messy that way," Kujack said. "An efficiency expert's 
war. War on an actuarial basis." 

"You get exactly the same results as in a shooting war," Len 
insisted. "Just as many dead, 
wounded and psychologically 
messed up. But you avoid the 
whole steamroller effect. A tidy 
war, war with dispatch, conceived 
in terms of ends rather than 
means. The end never did justify 
the means, you see; Steve Lundy 
says that was always the great 
dilemma of politics. So with one 
fool sweeps — fell swoop — we get 
rid of means entirely." 

"As things stand with me," Kujack said, "if anything stands 
with me, I might get to feeling 
sore about what happened to me. 
But nothing happens to the volunteer amputee. He steps up to 
the operating table and says, 'Just 
chop off one arm, Doc, the left 



one, .please, up to the elbow if 
you don't mind, and in return 
put me down for one-and-twothirds free meals daily at Longchamps and a plump blonde 
every Saturday.' " 

"Or whatever the exchange 
value for one slightly used left 
arm would be," Len amended. 
"That would have to be worked 
out by the robot actuaries." 

By this time I had the pros 
fitted and the push-button controls installed in the side pocket 
of Kujack's jacket. 

"Maybe you'd better go now, 
Len," I said. I was very careful 
to show no reaction to his baiting. 
"Kujack and I have some work 
to do." 

"I hope you'll make him a 
moth instead of a bedbug," Len 
said as he got up.- "Kujack's just 
beginning to see the light. Be a 
shame if you give him a negative 
tropism to it instead of a positive 
one." He turned to Kujack, wobbling a little. "So long, kid. I'll 
pick you up at seven and we'll 
drive into New York to have a 
few with Steve. He's going to be 
very happy to hear we've got the 
whole thing figured out." 

I spent two hours with Kujack, 
getting him used to the extremely 
delicate push-button controls. I 
must say that, drunk or sober, 
he's a very apt pupil. In less than 
two hours he actually walked! A 
little unsteadily, to be sure, but 



7« 




 



his balance will get better as he 
practices and I iron out a few 
more bugs, and I don't mean bedbugs. 

For a final test, I put a little 
egg cup on the floor, balanced a 
football in it, and told Kujack to 
try a place kick. What a moment! He booted that ball so 
hard, it splintered the mirror on 
the wall. 

November 27, 1959 

LONG talk with the boss. I 
gave it to him straight about 
breaking up the lab into K-Pro 
and N-Pro, and about there being little chance that Goldweiser 
would come up with anything 
much on the neuro end for a long, 
long time. He was awfully let 
down, I could see, so^ I started 
to talk fast about the luck I'd 
been having on the kinesthetic 
end. When he began to perk up, I 
called Kujack in from the corridor and had him demonstrate his 
place kick. 

He's gotten awfully good at it 
this past week. 

"If we release the story to the 
press," I suggested, "this might 
make a fine action shot. You see, 
Kujack used to be one of the 
beat kickers in the Big Ten, and 
a lot of newspapermen will still 
remember him." Then I sprang 
t>ie biggest news of all. "During 
tie last three days of practice, sir, 



he's been consistently kicking the 
ball twenty, thirty and even forty 
yards farther than he ever did 
with his own legs. Than anybody, 
as a matter of fact, ever has with 
real legs." 

"That's a wonderful angle," the 
boss said excitedly. "A world's 
record, made with a cybernetic 
leg!" 

"It should make a terrific picture," Kujack said. "I've also 
been practicing a big, broad, 
photogenic grin." Luckily the 
boss didn't hear him — by this 
time he was bending over the legs, 
studying the solenoids. 

After Kujack left, the boss congratulated me. Very, very warmly. It was a most gratifying moment. We chatted for a while, 
making plans for the press conference, and then finally he said, 
"By the way, do you happen to 
know anything about your friend 
Ellsom? I'm worried about him. 
He went off on Thanksgiving and 
hasn't been heard from at all ever 
since." 

That was alarming, I said. 
When the boss asked why, I told 
him a little about how Len had 
been acting lately, talking and 
drinking more than was good for 
him. With all sorts of people. The 
boss said that confirmed his own 
impressions. 

I can safely say we understood 
each other. I sensed a very definite rapport.

¥T was bound to happen, of 
" course. As I got it from the 
boss, he decided after our talk 
that Len's absence needed some 
looking into, and he tipped off 
Security about it. A half dozen 
agents went to work on the case 
and right off they headed for 
Steve Lundy's apartment in the j 
Village and, sure enough, there 
was Len. 

Len and his friend were both 
blind drunk and there were all 
sorts of incriminating things in 
the room — lots of peculiar books 
and pamphlets, Lundy's identification papers from the Lincoln 
Brigade, an article Lundy was 
writing for an anarchist -pacifist 
magazine about w,hat he calls 
Emsiac. Len and his friend were 
both arrested on the spot and a 
full investigation is going on now. 

The boss says that no matter 
whether Len is brought to trial or 
not, he's all washed up. He'll 
never get a job on any classified 
cybernetics project from now on, 
because it's clear enough that he 
violated his loyalty oath by discussing MS all over the place. 

The Security men came around 
to question me this morning. 
Afraid my testimony didn't help 
Len's case any. What could I do? 
I had to own up that, to my 
knowledge, Len had violated Security on three counts; he'd dis


»1 



cussed MS matters with Kujacfc 
in my presence, with Lundy (according to what he told rae), and 
of course with me (I am technically an outsider, too) . I also 
pointed out that I'd tried to make 
him shut up, but there was no 
stopping him once he got goingDamn that Len, anyhow. Why 
does he have to go and put me in 
this ethical spot? It shows a lack 
of consideration. 

These Security men can be too 
thorough. Right off they wanted 
to pick up Kujack as well. 

I got hold of the boss and explained that if they took Kujack 
away we'd have to call off our 
press conference, because it would 
take months to fit and train another subject. 

The boss immediately saw the 
injustice of the thing, stepped in 
and got Security to calm down, at 
least until we finish our demonstration. 

December 23, 1959 

W/^HAT a dayl The press conference this afternoon was 
something. Dozens of reporters 
and photographers and newsreel 
men showed up, and we took 
them atl out to the football field 
for the demonstrations. First the 
boss gave a little orientation talk 
about cybernetics being teamwork 
in science, and about the difference between K-Pro and N-Pro, 



pointing out that from the practical, humanitarian angle of helping the amputee, K is a lot more 
important than N. 

The reporters tried to get in 
some questions about ms, but he 
parried them very good -humoredly, and he said some nice things 
about me, some very nice things 
indeed. 

Then Kujack was brought in. 
He really went through his paces, 
walking, running, skipping, jumping and everything. It was 
damned impressive. And then, to 
top off the show, Kujack placekicked a football ninety-three 
yards by actual measurement, a 
world's record, and everybody 
went wild. 

Afterward Kujack and I posed 
for the newsreels, shaking hands 
while the boss stood with his arms 
around us. They're going to play 
the whole thing up as ifacs* 
Christmas present to one of our 
gallant war heroes (just what the 
boss wanted: he figures this sort 
of things makes ifacs sound so 
much less grim to the public), 
and Kujack was asked to say 
something in line with that idea. 

"I never could kick this good 
with my real legs," he said, holding my hand tight and looking 
straight at me. "Gosh, this is just 
about the nicest Christmas present a fellow could get. Thank 
you, Santa." 

I thought he was overdoing it 



B2 




 



e bit toward the end there, but 
the newsreel men say they think 
it's a great sentimental touch. 

Goldweiser was in the crowd, 
and he said. "I only hope that 
when / prove I'm God, this many 
photographers will show up." 
That's just about the kind of remark I'd expect from Goldweiser. 

Too bad the Security men are 
coming for Kujack tomorrow. 
The boss couldn't argue. After 
all, they were patient enough to 
wait until after the tests and 
demonstration, which the boss 
and I agree was white of them. 
It's not as if Kujack isn't deeply 
involved in this Ellsom-Lundy 
case. As the boss says, you can 
tell a man by the company, etc. 

December 25, 1959 

SPENT the morning clipping 
pictures and articles from the 
papers; they gave us Quite a 
spread. Late in the afternoon I 
went over to the boss's house for 
eggnogs, and I finally got up the 
nerve to say what's been on my 
mind for over a month now. 
Strike while the iron's, etc. 

"I've been thinking, sir," I said, 
"that this solenoid system I've 
worked out for Pros has other applications. For example, it could 
easily be adapted to some of the 
tricky mechanical aspects of an 
electronic calculator." I went into 
some of the technical details 



briefly, and I could see he was 
interested. "I'd like very much 
to work on that, now that K-Pro 
is licked, more or less. And if 
there is an opening in MS — " 

"You're a go-getter," the boss 
said, nodding in a pleased way. 
He was looking at a newspaper 
lying on the coffee table; on the 
front page was a large picture of 
Kujack grinning at me and shaking my hand. "I like that. I can't' 
promise anything, but let me 
think about it." 

1 think I'm in! 

December 27, 1959 

CENT the soup-and-fish out 
^ to be cleaned and pressed. 
Looks like I'm going to get some 
use out of it, after all. We're having a big formal New Year's Eve 
party in the commons room and 
there's going to be square dancing, swing-your-partner, and all 
of that. When I called Marilyn, 
she sounded very friendly — she

come. Seems she's gotten very 
fond of folk dancing lately. 

Gosh, it'll be good to get out of 
these dungarees for a while. I'm

BEFORE them the ball took 
a savage turn toward the 
player in white. Around 
Grant the crowd stood up and 
roared, and he felt suddenly tense 
and doubting. Then the player 
ducked, the ball shot through 
above him to smash against the 
court wall, and he controlled the 
rebound to send the sphere once 
more into erratic, darting flight. 

"Again!" Grant felt his muscles suddenly relax with release 
of anxiety. He turned to the girl, 
**Bee, I'm worried. It's not like 
Tony — does he want to get killed? 
He should stop those shots, not 
dodge them. Are you sure he"s all 
right?" 

"Now, Granny." The girl kept 
her eyes fixed on the court. "Remember, Tony took this match 
for charity. He wants the crowd 
to have a show, that's all. He is 
in splendid shape."

"No sleep," Grant went on worriedly. "I'm sure it must be that. 
If his brain were alert, he'd control ' that ball until Slag went 
crazy. Without sleep, you can't 
focus prop — " 

"Please, Granny, atop!" In 
that instant her throbbing raiad 
touched his, and he caught a 
glimpse of the alarm in her face. 
She, too, felt that something was 
wrong. But she tugged at his 
sleeve and pointed through the 
screen at the oval below. "Look!" 

Slag's feet were set wide apart, 
and his black-robed body stood 
square. But his head had begun 
a sort of slow wobble, from side 
to side, as the ball lanced in penhedral swings about the court. 

"Praise Allah !" whispered 
Grant. "A beautiful dance! 
Tony's thinking that gangster, 
into a coma." 

The white player was in concentration, using his eyes only 
rarely in shifting ever more complex movements to the sphere. 
Then the rhythmic pattern had 
become a wild corondo, with Slag 
as its center, and the dark figure 
stood hypnotized, with only spasmodic jerks of his brutal features 
to mark the fear in his mind. 
. "Now," said Grant. His voice 
seemed loud in the awed silence 
of the spectators. "Now, Tony! 
Call it a day!" 

"Just touch him ," whispered 
Bee. "Don't hurt him, Tony," 



It was as if they had signaled 
the player, even through the teleproof screen. Gradually the wild 
swings of the ball slowed. It circled Slag gently, dropped closer, 
and poised above him. Tony's 
mind was clearly in full control 
of the sensitive sphere. 

In a seat behind Grant, an excited man suddenly yelled, 
"Thumbs down, hard!" Obviously the crowd was ready to sacrifice its erstwhile hero. 

Then — the ball moved, a small 
movement, and there was a roar. 
Uninfluenced, the ball dropped 
and rolled to the center court, 
and Tony stood in bewilderment 
as Slag shook himself awake. 

Grant leaped up and tried to 
push through to the box exit. 
Behind him, Bee clung. "Granny, what will you do? What can 
you . . ." 

He shook her off and answered 
her with his mind as he struggled 
on. "Stop them, that's what! End 
the match." 

"How? You know you cannot r

thought Grant. / invented a spori. 
Oh, Allah! What has my sport 
become? 

And then her mind shrieked at 
him, stabbed at his brain: "Tony 
—Tony darling!" 

Dazedly he heard the moan 
and fought a path to the transparent screen. Out on the court 
lay a white figure, outspread, and 
the ball rolled slowly past the 
dripping head. 

"Too late!" sobbed Bee. "Too 
late! Tony . . J* 

SOMEHOW she was down 
there before Grant. He saw 
her, huddled over Tony's body, 
as he finally reached an open gate 
in the domed screen. On the opposite edge of the court, Psychosport Commissioner Woods was 
in conversation with the referee, 
Harmon. A flash bulb glowed. 
Three reporters looked at the 
fallen player and spoke casually 
to each other. Towering above 
the group was Slag, staring down 
as if surprised. 

Grant went first to the Commissioner, who adopted a defensive attitude immediately, throwing up his hands. 

"Don't jump on me, now. It 
seems I am helpless. Ask Harmon 
yourself. There was nothing 
wrong that he could see." 

"That's nonsense," said Grant, 
"and you It now it. No matter 
who it is, a ball will not smash 



into an awake player. It simply 
cannot be done. Even a novice 
can overcontrol his opponent at 
that range." 

"Right. ■ It couldn't have happened." Sarcasm indicated the 
worry felt by Woods. "Damn it. 
Lane, that's the way it is. Harmon watched like a hawk in his 
bubble. The dome was sealed; not 
a single leak. Slag's second 
crouched behind the shield and 
never moved. I personally supervised Anthony's examination. He 
was in perfect condition. The 
only thing yet to check is the 
ball, but the ball . . » 

"You have it? Never mind, no 
ball invented could do that alone. 
Tony could handle any ball, even 
without the new sensitive core. 
And in a hundred games every 
day, they don't ever have this 
sort of accident." 

"Just when Slag plays." The 
Commissioner touched Grant's 
arm helplessly. "The force of the 
man's mind must be teuible. 
Lane. He must be a superman. 
But what am I going to do? If I 
outlaw him without legal grounds 
. . ." He stopped, gulped nervously. 

"There may be no grounds 
from your point of view find 
theirs." Grant gestured at the 
crowd struggling through the exits. "But there are from mine. H 
I'm to remain Honorary President of the Association, Slag has 



PSYCHOTENNIS, ANYONE? 



got to go. That's final!" 

Woods said, "Lane, you could 
stop this another way. If you 
don't, and you put Slag out, they 
will think . . ." But Grant was 
already hurrying over to Bee Anthony. 

More people joined the group 
and talk died away as uniformed 
men bent down to the prone figure. Bee sobbed in Giant's arms. 
Her mind was withdrawn, grieving, and he patted her awkwardly 
while he thought of how much 
these young twins had come to 
mean to him in the years since 
he began his research in metaphysics. Just children, they had 
seemed at first. He had been 
young Doctor Lane, graduate of 
*52 on fellowship, and they were 
the kids he had worked with, who 
had shown remarkable powers of 
the mind. 

Tony and himself — they had 
formulated the methods which 
; still governed the cultivation of 
telekinesis. Grant had discovered 
"the principles, but it was the successful results of the Anthony 
boy's training which paved the 
way for others to learn. Yet Bee 
was different. No amount of tutoring could help her influence an 
object with her mind. Different, 
but not inferior, for Bee was a 
telepath. With intimates her conversation was most strange - — 
much of it understood, yet left 
Unspoken. 



Grant was one of the intimates. 
Her silent sorrow would have 
found him at any distance, but 
now he tried to evade it, because 
Tony was gone and Woods had 
come over to face the reporters — 
and Slag. 

"Mister Woods," began one of 
the men, but the Commissioner 
raised a hand and turned to the 
giant player. 

"You have had my personal 
warning, Slag. Do, you think I 
will allow you to carry on your 
ugly career? Why, man, you're 
lucky the courts have not ruled 
you a murderer!" 

"It's not my fault," Slag said. 
"I didn't try to smash him, honest. I don't know my own 
strength, I guess." 

Bee's reddened eyes stared at 
the man, and Grant whispered, 
"Darling, can you tell?" 

"You know their minds are 
closed to me. I just feel . . . some T 
thing evil. I must get out of here. 
Please, Grant, take me away." 

Behind Slag the little blond 
man Teagle, manager and second of the professional, spoke up. 
"Like Slag says, Commissioner, 
it isn't his fault. These fastthinking players match him, get 
him all excited in the court, and 
then wonder why they get knocked down. They just don't have 
the stuff to match a champ/' 

"Slag is the only man ever 
warned to pull his shots," agreed 



a* 




 



a reporter who was taking notes. 

"Gentlemen!" Woods turned to 
Grant. "All of us here respect the 
opinion of Dr. Lane, who brought 
this sport into being and who is, 
in my estimation, its greatest exponent. I have consulted with 
him. If he is to retain any connection whatever with the game, 
he informs me, Slag must get 
out." 

There was silence. The men 
stared first at the florid-faced 
Commissioner, then at Grant. 

"More than personal considerations are involved/* added 
Woods. "Slag's brutal style of 
play, according to Dr. Lane, endangers' the entire future of this 
grand sport." 

The black-robed player looked 
around for support. Little Teagle 
pushed in front of the Commissioner. "You mean that hasbeen," he pointed at Grant, "is 
trying to get rid of my boy? It 
ain't fair, I say. Even when he 
tries to take it easy, Slag has it 
tough. They're scared, and won't 
match us — even these amateurs. 
And yet look what we've done to 
pep the game up!" 

"You may be right, Mister 
Teagle. All things considered, 
however, I feel the merit of Dr. 
Lane's suggest — " 

"Who is this Lane?" The little 
man's face was fierce. "So he 
starts the game, and invents the 
ball, so what? They used to call 



him a champ, the master, but 
that's a long time ago. Now that 
he's out, he don't like Slag coming up so strong. It kills him that 
he ain't the best any more." 

"That will be all for tonight. 
In the morning I'll have an official release ready." The reporters 
were tense, atfxious to miss nothing. "And, gentlemen, you h,ave 
a good idea of the nature of that 
statement." 

"Wait! I'm telling you," said 
Teagle. "We've tried to get a 
match with this Lane., Here it is, 
boys, the real truth. The guy 
wants Slag out because he's 
scared to meet him. Right here 
and now we challenge him! And 
I bet he hasn,'t got the guts to 
take us up." 

"I feel," said Woods, "that a 
scientist like Dr. Lane should not 
be subjected to this . . . this insolence." 

The reporters ran toward the 
exit, eager to call in this news 
break. 

Grant said nothing. Aware of 
Bee's feelings, he shot a look of 
contempt at Teagle and turned. 
Yet he knew, as they walked 
slowly away, that behind him 
were no feelings of good will. At 
best, the men awaited his next 
move — -and until then suspended 
judgment. 

■"N three days the city became 
for Grant Lane a savage jun

gle. The papers shrieked at hirri 
Teagle's endless insults, Slag's 
boastful challenge. Each statement by the Commissioner cleverly shifted more responsibility 
from Woods to himself, and the 
tragic end of yet another match 
was played down until it appeared that Slag, and not his opponent, was the injured party. 

After all, was his crowd-convincing argument, did they jail 
professional fighters in the old 
days when one was killed? Just 
a little accident in the heat of 
fair contest; it was no more than 
that. Yet there was more, this 
time. People appeared unsatisfied, disapproving of Grant, as if 
he should offer himself as a sacrifice to their sympathy with 
Slag. The one time he went restlessly into the streets, they watched him sullenly, waiting . . . 

He lrept to his apartment after 
that, and studied furiously. No 
man could overcontrol an awake 
©pponent in a direct shot — if the 
ball was all right. As the ball 
closed in, the approached player's 
influence grew proportionately 
vtrenger, while his opponent's 
lessened in inverse ratio. That 
was the reason Grant had originally declared the sport to be 
•afe. 

He interrupted his work only 
briefly for Tony's funeral, and 
felt an obscure shame in facing 
Bee Anthony. Then the cellular 



organism of the sphere used in 
the game absorbed his attention 
again. It was an artificially nurtured nerve-center, a growth devised by himself, and seemed to 
offer the only possible answer. 
Perhaps this suh-life had acquired learning ability — the ability to act independently. It seemed absurd, and yet how much 
was really known of this highly 
irritable stuff called living matter? 

Bee found him at his apartment the fourth morning. She 
seemed much more relaxed. 
"Tony hated useless grief," she 
said. "I had to come here. Granny. I had to know that we might 
see the end of all this." 

"Yes." Grant still felt a vague 
shame. "Well have to stop Slag 
short, before he adds any more 
victims." 

"Oh, it's more than that! It's 
the people, too, and the knowledge that more Slags may appear! If all the matches suddenly 
, . She broke off, frowning, as 
if uncertain whether to continue. 
"You see, Granny, Tony decided 
to play because of that. It wasn't 
even the charities, really. The 
people distrust you. Not just because you were wrong, but because they are suspicious of any 
probing into the powers of mind. 
They prefer fantasy to scientific 
hypothesis, and now Slag's triumphs ..." She faltered, and 



•>0 




 



unhappily twisted her face away.. 

"But Tony could have crushed 
Slag, too." 

"You know that was different. 
He had Slag hypnotized first. But 
Tony was awake when the ball 
struck!" 

"You're right, Bee. Frankly, I 
don't know what the answer 
could be. I'm working on the 
core of the ball. There is a 
chance — " 

"I'm sure it was something 
else! Granny, have you thought 
of the screen? There must have 
been a leak, or a- failure. Think 
of that crowd, hoping for their 
hero. Suppose they subconsciously influenced the sphere, directed 
it at Tony." 

He thought of the mob's reaction when Slag was helpless, and 
kept silent. It would be cruel to 
blast her one hope with nothing 
to offer in exchange. 

"You think I'm wrong, but 
what else would it be? The ball 
couldn't kill Tony by itself." 
Then she was in tears. "I should 
have been there to stop it. He 
wouldn't take a second — I begged him to let me — and I would 
have sensed any outside influence!" 

Grant recognized the guilt feelings she was suffering from. He 
tried to give comfort, but suddenly she was a woman, proud 
and independent, and would not 
stay. Only at the door for one 



moment did she turn appealingly to him. 

"Granny, you're not going to 
play Slag!" 

"Do you want me to? Should 
I obey the roar of the mob? And 
look!" He gestured at one of the 
papers, where a center-page box 
proclaimed, "Commissioner Rules 
Out Lane-Slag Match." "At 
thirty-seven they say I'm too old 
to play." 

"Don't do it. Grant." He felt 
her conflicting, torn emotions. 
"Yet, the funny thing is, I don't 
think I could live if they allow 
Slag to go on and on." 

GRANT'S apartment was illequipped for working with 
micro-organisms. So, although 
preliminary study opened up no 
encouraging line of experimentation, next day he transferred his 
work to the university laboratories. He found his colleagues 
friendly-^ — one had cheerfully handled Grant's lectures during his 
absence — but reserved, as if they 
suspected him to be guilty of 
some terrible sin, yet hoped he 
might prove himself innocent. 

Barker, the bio-chemist, listened to his theory of the probability of change in the nerve center of the ball. "I have not worked with these cultures," he said. 
"You claim they are artificially 
produced solely to provide a focal receptor for the controlling 



PSYCHOTENNIS, ANYONE? 



minds. At* the cells non-reproductivc?" 

"Yes. You see, the structure 
must be stable. Any mind can 
provide the necessary power to 
move Hght objects short distances, but focusing that power 
is the difficulty. Hence the sensitive core. The operator can 
sense where to direct his will." 

Barker reflected a moment. "So 
the culture is purely static — 
doesn't even amplify the influence. In that case, I can only 
visualize such changes as natural 
radiation might bring about. No 
hope there for a recurrent pattern 
of change." 

"Learning ability — acquisition 
of power to act voluntarily — I 
thought the answer might be in 
that." 

"We'll see. Might as well begin 
there, anyway. Get us a few of 
the balls, Lane, and I'm sure the 
staff will gladly try to help out." 

That evening Grant walked 
onto the court of the Colliseum 
and was made certain of the city's 
anger toward him. Bee's idea was 
worth testing, and be had 
brought with him some student 
telepaths, but the instant he appeared the crowd rose in a storm 
of fury. When the announcer requested spectators to direct the 
ball at Grant, their wrath gave 
way to cheers, and they concentrated hopefully on crushing him. 
But the screen held, the telepaths 



sensed no invading influence as 
Grant whirled the ball about the 
court, until in disgust he signaled 
for the screen to be deactivated. 

Instantly the will of the crowd 
took hold. The sphere jerked erratically until concerted influence 
steadied it opposite Grant. Then 
it flashed into motion, a heavy, 
deadly missile, with all the mind 
power of a mob driving it murderously across the court at him. 

He stopped it easily, six inches 
away. 

BARKER said, "No use seeking further. We may not know 
everything living organisms can 
do, but we can certninly tell what 
is beyond their power. The tests 
are conclusive." 

Lorms, the bchaviorist, nodded 
his head. 

For just an instant Grant felt 
confused, helpless. His original 
arguments for psychosport were 
proved valid, but the killings became even more inexplicable — 
they were logically impossible! 
And, sometiow, that made him 
the criminal. 

That left him only one thing 
to do. 

It was humiliating to accept 
such a solution to his personal 
problem. He thought of Bee Anthony and nearly turned back. 
Only since the tragedy .had he 
realized how changed was their 
relationship — and how important

she was to him. Would she scorn 
his action, think him a slave to 
public pressure? Probably, but 
Grant forced his steps onward. 

In the lobby of the Page-Horton, Bee caught him by the arm. 
"Since when," she asked, "do you 
walk grimly past your friends? 
. . . No, Grant. Don't bother to 
think up a story. I know where 
you are going." 

He wanted to chase her away— 
and to pull her close to him. But 
she glanced up and laughed. "You 
look so perplexed and silly. Professor Lorms called me, and of 
course I knew what you'd do/* 

"Do you think," said Grant, 
"that I should, Bee? Is it right?" 

"Darling, fighting results from 
frustration and breeds even more 
frustration and anger. But somehow men get cornered until — well, 
they have to. Not Tony. He was 
a gay fool, tilting at windmills. 
Oh, Grant ! I know you're 
wrong, but you're right, too, and 
inside I'm so glad!" 

He wanted to erase the worry 
behind her gladness, to smother 
tt with reassurance. They went up 
together to Stag's suite. Teagle 
was at the door. "Glad to see 
you, Mahomet," he said to Grant. 
"The contract's all ready to sign. 
I guess you'll want your cut for 
charity, eh?" 

"You won't, I suppose." 

"Not on your life. Excuse the 
double meaning. Miss." He 



smirked at Bee, "I ask you. who's 
going to match us after, we knock 
this one off?" 

Slag stared glumly from a 
chair, not even removing his hand 
from the glass beside him. "Practicing," he said. "Getting into 
shape for our tussle, Doc. Like 
Teagle said, you had to come 
across." 

Grant took the papers from the 
manager, filled in the blanks and 
signed. 

"Don't talk much, this Doc 
Lane," said Slag. "Should I show 
him, Teagle?" 

"Sure thing. Watch this practice, Doc." 

The big man concentrated on 
the amber bottle beside him. 
Slowly, jerkily, it lifted — one 
inch, then two. Slag relaxed, and 
watched v it ring as it fell to the 
table. "My job when I retire," he 
said. "Got to pour it right into 
the glass. Pretty hot, eh?" 

Grant gave no warning. The 
man's trousers were deluged as 
the glass shattered in his hand. 
He leaped up cursing, and then 
moved quickly and with ugly 
purpose toward his visitors. 

"Careful, boy," warned Teagle. "There's a dame present." 

For fifteen seconds Grant's eyes 
were locked with Slag's. He looked into their red-rimmed hatred, 
fought to see the depths of the 
man. Then, just before the other 
turned away, an unreasoning, un


PSYCHOTENNIS, ANYONE? 



93 



expected emotion surged in 
Grant. It swept over and left him 
shaken, all in that instant. 
The emotion was fear. 

OUT on the court it was anger 
he felt, anger at Slag, who 
stood opposite and bowed to the 
noisy throng, anger at Teagle, 
who chanted insults until ordered 
behind the second's shield, at the 
spectators, packing the Colliseum 
in hopes of seeing a player maimed or killed — and Bee Anthony, 
even at Bee. 

She had defied him, bribed her 
way in to act as his second, and 
had slipped behind the shield at 
his side of the court. In front of 
those jeering faces, it was out of 
the question to make her leave. 

There was a roar as the ball 
dropped from the referee's overhead bubble. Grant left it to Slag, 
let the man shoot crudely several 
times, and fought to calm himself. The shots were forceful, but 
easily stopped and returned. It 
was like Tony's match, almost 
too slow at first. Until the players became absorbed, it was hopeless to attempt any kind of hypnotic effects with the ball. 

Slag swung the sphere into 
rapid circles about the court. The 
crowd watched silently, as if impressed by the player's control. 
To Grant it was absurd — he knew 
that any trained child could exe


cute the movements. And yet, 
Tony must have felt so, too. But 
that was before — 

The ball dropped on him like 
a hawk, and he almost laughed. 
To give the gasping crowd a 
thrill, he barely deflected the 
shot, and feigned amazement. 
Slag retrieved control. 

Beneath the sudden amusement, Grant was uneasy. Slag 
had never won a real victory— 
never dazed or hypnotized an opponent before striking. All his 
triumphs rested on single, smashing thrusts. How was it possible? 
With such clumsy control , the 
professional could never set up 
a victory — yet the record stood. 
Grant could not fathom the problem. If the match went on forever, he could see no way for 
Slag to drop him. And if he 
quickly whirled Slag into dazed 
defeat, the real mystery might 
never be solved. His opponent 
Would merely have suffered defeat in a match not even recognized by the Commission. 

Now he could guess why Tony 
had played carelessly. It was not 
only victory that was sought. He 
had deluded himself in accepting 
such an irresponsible way out. 
The whole affair depressed him, 
knotted itself into mind-snaring 
tangles. The ball blurred again 
and he hardly cared, only ducking to let it splat against the 
shield behind him. A spurt of 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOM 



rage sent the sphere spinning 
back at Slag, but the other diverted it easily into a scree a hugging orbit. 

Tony, Slag, Woods and Teagte 
— they seemed to merge confusedly in his mind. They stood, each 
in turn, at the door of an ironbarred cell. For Grant, there was 
no way out. Win or lose, live or 
die, he was doomed. The light 
dimmed in the cell. Just for an 
instant Bee appeared, her hair 
throwing off sparks of brilliance. 
She, too, faded out. Neither Bee 
the child, whom he did not love, 
nor Bee the woman, who did not 
love him, could save him. Before 
him gaped the bottomless pit of 
shame and penance. He had unloosed a monster on the world. 
He had to pay for that. 

But first Grant had another 
debt to pay. He tried to throw off 
the depression, imagining as he 
did so a sob of joy in the disem bodied Bee. He wrested the 
sweeping ball from Slag, even 
from the opposite end of the 
court. He spun it in wild orbiti 
and compensated for the other's 
furious thrusts. Faster and faster 
he circled it. Slag's mind could 
not keep up the pace. The even 
swings acquired a jogging pattern, edged farther out — to within 
ten feet of Slag. A quick break 
lanced behind the man, out again, 
and then the sphere fell into helical loops, thrice differentiated by 



harmonic variations, and swept! 
wide around the court. 

Somehow Slag's distress gave 
Grant no pleasure. Defeat seemed 
to face him everywhere; he read 
it in his opponent's twisted features, even in the futile effort t» 
withdraw attention from the balL 
It's no good, he thought, t havm 
failed all along. 

Savagely he worked the sphere. 
He would do it quickly. The*« 
was no use expecting Tony's fa*e. 
The ball darted again for Slag 
and this time there could be *v» 
interference. It became pure 
mathematics, the motion, complin 
cated far beyond Tony's simple 
corondo, a flashing three-dimeasional blur of color. He could not 
keep it up.' The concentration 
brought an invading blackness tx> 
his mind. Somewhere there was 
a dull roar, and he felt as if fata 
own mind were cracking. His 
nerves quivered to put an cad to 
it, to touch Slag with the baU. 
Slowly, cautiously, he brought 
the sphere down , . „ 

Slag was not there I 

He gaped. His eyes sudden!/ 
found the crumpled heap across 
the court, and relief swept ovec 
him. The man was beaten, in a 
state of collapse, and there was 
nothing more Grant could do. 

"Grant!" Bee screamed. "Ohj, 
no! Grant darling, look upf* 

Her radiance was almost blinding. He half -twisted to reach her. 



PSYCHOTENNIS, ANYONE? 



and then his eyes caught it — the 
ugly sheen of the fast-growing 
ball. Desperately he turned, and 
it shifted in unison. Then she 
shrieked once more, despairingly, 
and he threw himself flat, arms 
outstretched, toward her. 

The ball's speed was so great 
that it shattered to pieces against 
the shield behind him. 

From back of the barrier ran 
Bee. She crouched beside him, 
and her enveloping warmth lifted 
the evil spell from his mind. The 
loud confusion of the crowd burst 
upon him, he saw the referee's 
swiftly lowering bubble. He was 
in control of himself, thanks to 
Bee's interference, and could act 
on the knowledge so dangerously 
gained. 

"The murderer!" Grant pulled 
Bee up with him. "We've got 
him!" 

Opposite them, Slag still lay 
on the court. 

"I don't see how he did it," 
Grant said bewilderedly. 

"Not Slag — him!" She pointed 
out the small, running figure. 

Teagle battered vainly at a 
gate. The still-active screen held 
him back, and the man's face was 
a despairing white grimace. Then 
Grant was upon him, and took 
him by the throat. 

WOODS paced the dressing 
room, still confused. "I begin to see," he said, "but what can 



1 do with the two of them?" 

"Stop worrying." Grant was 
curt. "You can do nothing. The 
law will take Teagle, and without 
him Slag is just another bum." 

"He never knew," marveled 
Bee. "Slag never knew how he 
won." 

"I am to blame." Grant 
thought of the surging fear Teagle had directed in him at Slag's 
hotel. "I should have known that 
telepsychical phenomena could 
be used as a weapon. The man is 
a freak. He couldn't influence the 
ball, but communicated overpowering emotion — without even seeing his subjects — from behind his 
shield. The victims committed 
suicide, just as I nearly did before Bee . . ." 

"What did you feel — a socalled death wish?" asked- Woods. 
"No matter. Not seeing Slag collapse, he overplayed his hand.*' 

"Slag's being unconscious merely provided an anti-climax," said 
Grant. "There was a more important factor added this time. 
And if you don't mind, Woods, 
I have an apology to make in private to my one and only second." 

"Not just the only one, darling," said Bee. "But your permanent, till-death-do-us-part second! Right?" 

"Right!" Grant said. 

"That's the only thing tonight,'* 
said Woods, "of which I officially 
approve." , — LLOYD WILLIAMS

STAR 



SHELF 



SEEDS OF LIFE, by John 
Taine. Fantasy Press, Reading, 
Pa., 1951. 255 pages, $2.75. 

rpHE eleventh of Eric Temple 
Bell's pseudonymous science 
fictions to get into book form during the last quarter- century, this 
deals with the science and mystery of evolution. It does so in a 
style that can only be forgiven 
because of its age (1931) and with 
characterizations and a plot that 
can hardly be forgiven at all — 
and yet it is a superb tale that 
every lover of science fiction will 
want to have around. 



The story tells of the effects 
(imagined) of certain short-wave 
radiations on biological > life. At 
"low" voltages the unicellular life 
on the skin of the operator begins 
racing frantically through the 
stages of evolution on the unicellular level ; it gives him the 
itch. At higher powers, the same 
speeding-up of life processes happens to some black widow spiders, 
a frog, and a chicken; and at still 
higher powers to man. 

The horror of the whole concept — and the book is essentially 
a horror story — is that Taine conceives of evolution as a circular

process, ending near where it began, with the reptiles. This happens with the eggs that Bertha 
the hen mothered, and also with 
a man-child. 

One human .being is actually 
transmuted into the Man of the 
Future, rather than to a reptilian 
predecessor, and it is around this 
incredible genius, Miguel de Soto, 
that the plot revolves. 

Completely off-trail science fiction — and highly recommended 
therefore. 

GREAT STORIES OF SCIENCE FICTION, edited by 
Murray Leinster. Introduction by 
Clifton Fadiman. Random House, 
New York, 1951. 321 pages, $2.95. 

There has never been another 
science fiction collection like this 
one ; it is unique. Leinster has 
been given the opportunity of 
selecting the stories he likes best 
from the whole field of science 
fiction, and somebody has not 
only published his selection but 
(presumably) paid him to make 
it The result? Just as screwy and 
delightful a book as would be the 
one you or I would turn out if we 
were' given this chance. 

The two introductions are 
worth the price of admission 
alone. Fadiman's is a beautifully 
literate and practically definitive 
anatomy of mode rn science fiction — brief, succinct, scholarly 



98 




and luminously intelligent. Lemster's is an enchantingly bizarre,, 
gadget-crazy, hobby-riding, history-hopping and totally Leinsterish gallop through the whole 
field of science, from Ben Franklin down to the atomic machine 
named Elsie, and then out beyond 
the Fitzgerald Contraction into 
the stories in the book itself. 
These number twelve, as follows: 
The Fascinating Stranger by 
Michael Fessier (a dandy tale you 
probably never have seen); Liquid Life by Ralph Milne Farley 
(about thinking viruses); Symbiosis by Will Jenkins (and no 
comment from me, either!) ; Number Nine by Cleve Cartmill (a 
story about a rabbit) ; Blind Alley 
by Malcolm Jameson (pleasant 
even though it's not science fiction 
— it's Unknown Worlds fantasy) ; 
In Hiding by Wilmar Shiras 
(about mutants); No Woman 
Born by C. L. Moore (one of the 
truly great science fiction stories) ; 
The Strange Case o! John King* 
man by Murray Leinster (ditto); 
Open Secret by Lewis Padgett 
(unforgettable goose - pimpler) J 
The Chronokinesis of Jonathan 
Hull by Anthony Boucher (bewildering!); and The Chromium 
Helmet by Theodore Sturgeon (f 
adore this tale). Five of the above ■» 
— at least — have been anthologized before, but worth many 
more reprintings. 

At the end there is a list of 79 

f AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



more anthologized stories that M. 
L. also liked. A wonderful list, 
indicating how rich and varied 
modern science fiction is. 

It's particularly valuable as a 
means of converting the heathen 
to science fiction, but you'll make 
sure you get the book back so you 
can read it yourself. 

THE TOY MAKER, by Raymond F. Jones. Fantasy Publishing Co., Inc., Los Angeles, Calif., 
1951. 287 pages, $3.00. 

A collection of six Jones novelets and short stories, ranging in 
quality from the fine tale that 
gives the book its title down to 
the piece of gadget- space-opera 
called Utility. In between, you 
have Jones on all levels. 

The Toymaker tells how a retired Professor of Peace and a 
physicist -inventor together defeat 
the war drive of a certain planet's 
politicians by "taking over" the 
imaginations of most of the children. They jdevelop toys called 
"Imaginos" which operate through 
a combination of hypnotism and 
mass emotionalism. At first the 
children see fascinating games 
and actions in the toys; but later, 
as the war hysteria rises in the 
real world, the hand of violence 
actually strikes in the Imaginoworlds. The politicians are forced 
to abandon the war drive in order 
to save the children's sanity. A 



shocking fable for our times. 

The Model Shop tells of the 
advent of men from the future in 
an engineering development laboratory of today, and the hob 
thafrresults when they apply their 
immensely advanced technology 
to our rather crude machine concepts. 

The Deadly Host is an unoriginal but exciting tale about 
mechanical insect-robots, self-reproducing, who live by draining 
Earth's electricity — and, obviously, its civilization, too. 

Utility is really a low-grade, 
pseudo-funny space opera having 
to do with a pathological drunk 
named Hydrophobia McCord, 
some objets called Jewelworlds 
from the planet Merans, and a 
passel of other nonsense, including an honest-to-God Villain. 

Forecast is about weather-control In the future — how men move 
storms about and create rain 
when they want it — and how the 
Big Bad Hydroponics Trust tries 
to break 'em up because they are 
bringing back natural farming 
and putting hydroponics out of 
business. Excellent scientific imagination; pretty primitive plotting. 

As for Children's Rocfm, it is 
in the grand tradition of the Padgett - MacDonald - Shiras - Stapledon mutant stories. Here the mutants have been escaping to another dimension for hundreds of

how a modern one gets from our 
world to theirs. 

NATURE'S WAYS, by Roy 
Chapman Andrews. Crown Publishers, New York, 1951. 206 
pages, $3.75. 

rjiHIS 8" by II" book's subtitle 
describes what it does. "How 
Nature Takes Care of Its Own" 
is what it says, and the book contains about 140 different examples 
of how animals of innumerable 
sorts, from spiders to marmots, 
camels to pickaback tadpoles, 
pikas to okapis (no kidding!) and 
pied-billed grebes to insect brownies, have adapted their ways to 
their environment in order to 
survive 

The exciting tale is told by a 
master naturalist, and is illustrated with 68 magnificent fullcolor paintings and over 100 excellent black-and-white photographs. The paintings were done 
by Andre Durenccau, for the most 
part, with others contributed by 
Steven Dohanos, A. J. Kurka, C 
B. Falls, et al. It is a book which 
shows, both in words and pictures, that science fiction still can 
be outdistanced by Nature, when 
Nature really tries! 

SEETEE SHIP, by Will Stewart. 
Gnome Press, New York, 1951. 
255 pages, $2.75. 



"C EETEE " is Contra-Terrene 
matter, or matter in which 
each atom is composed of a negative nucleus and positive electrons 
— just the opposite from the matter we know. Seetee is scientifically possible, having been prognosticated over ten years ago by 
Nobel prize winning physicists W. 
Heisenberg, E. Schrodinger and 
P. A. M. Dirac. They also posited 
that terrene and contra -terrene 
matter would annihilate each 
other on contact — 190 per cent 
efficient release of atomic energy! 
The uranium bomb releases something like 10 per cent. 

Wonderful meat for science fiction, one would say. And "Will 
Stewart" (Jack Williamson) has 
here taken full advantage of the 
concept's possibilities — technically speaking. 

But the book's quality as a 
novel? Here we have a parody 
United Nations on an interplanetary scale called The Mandate; 
a real narsty old corporation called Interplanet; The Martian 
Retch, the Jovian Soviet, and the 
Earth i'-m I-don't-know-what-all; 
and finally a few selfless people 
and their families who (unlike the 
others) want to develop seetee 
power for the Good of the People, 
and to hell with Profit. 

It's a good story if you can 
bear plowing through pages of 
literary corn -starch.

The 

Puppet 

Masters 

By ROBERT A. HEINU1N 

CONCLUSION OF A 3 PART SERIAL 
Illustrated by Don Sibtey 



SYNOPSIS 

Flying Saucers? Invaders from 
outer space? Nonsense! That this 
was any "sensible" person's reaction was one major advantage 
the parasites of Titan had over 
vs. The other was their ability to 



take over a city without any apparent sign of doing so . Each 
parasite was a formless, featureless mass of protoplasm, helpleaa 
by itself but able to dominate 
its victim by clinging to the 
shoulderblades and taking over 
the body, the mind and the will 



Beaten in every bottle with the ghastly 
invaders, man has one single weapon left 
— his mind! But will that prav* enough? 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



of its powerless human host. 

The parasites had conquered 
the Mississippi Valley before we 
could get anyone to listen. I was 
in it from the start, along with 
the Old Man (my section chief 
as well as my father) and another 
agent known to me as "Mary 
Cavanaugh." We flushed the first 
parasite in Des Moines, Iowa, 
soon after their first landing, 
through one of the few failures 
on the part of the parasites to 
simulate human behavior, i.e., a 
man possessed failed to show a 
normal, healthy, male response 
to Mary's red-haired beauty. 

If not for that, the parasites 
would have been completely perfect fifth columnists. They would 
seize first those persons concerned 
with communications and public 
order and thereby suppress the 
very knowledge of their own existence. I myself was captured by 
one we had fetched back from 
Iowa, and I secured for them the 
city of New Brooklyn before I 
was recaptured and freed by the 
Old Man. Thereafter I was coerced by him into permitting myself to be "interviewed" while 
possessed by a parasite, but under 
close restraint. This was the foulest trick ever played on a man, 
for the Old Man used Mary as 
bait to force me to agree to being 
possessed again by one of the 
dirty slugs— knowing that I was 
in love with Mary. It made me 



disgusted with them both. 

But it did enable us to learn 
where they came from — Titan, 
moon of Saturn. This time we 
had proof we could show to the 
President. Not enough proof to 
convince Congress of the incredible danger, however. It took a 
joint session in which seven parasites were captured right on the 
floor of Congress, off the bodies 
of possessed Congressmen, before 
they granted emergency powers 
to act. By then the country was 
split in two, from Canada to 
New Orleans. 

With the President setting the 
example, the unconquered part 
of the country stripped down to 
, shorts for men and shorts and 
halters for women in order to 
give the parasites no place to 
hide. A paratroop task force was 
organized to redeem the Central 
Valley. It was believed that the 
parasites were comparatively few 
in number and that the area could 
be recaptured by concentrating 
on stereo stations, police headquarters and the like. I was sent 
by the Old Man on a scouting 
expedition to Kansas City just 
before the air drop. 

I made the overwhelming discovery that we had vastly underestimated their numbers; Kansas 
City was not merely "secured" — 
it was saturated. Well over 90% 
of the population was possessed, 
although the parasites, tor rea


102 




 



eons of their own, were still maintaining the masquerade of a 
normal human society. 

J barely got out without being 
repossessed, but not in time to 
prevent the paratroop assault. 
Against such smothering odds, 
the task force was lost to the 
last man. Had we properly studied the parasites already captured, we might have predicted 
it, for, given an adequate supply 
oi hosts, the Titans could multiply indefinitely, by conjugation 
followed by fission reproduction. 

We settled down to a stalemate 
siege. Under "Schedule Bareback" it seemed hardly possible 
for the parasites to infiltrate out 
of the Mississippi Valley, but, on 
the other hand, we had not devised any way to rescue the millions of human victims in the 
central states. 

As for me, I was still shaken 
by the horror of being possessed. 
Mary and I took a few days leave 
together and I bullied her into 
marrying me. 

We went to my cabin in the 
Adirondacks; there followed the 
only completely happy period of 
my life. We never listened to a 
newscast; we saw no one; we put 
the Titan parasites out of our 
minds. Just Mary, me, and my 
cat, Pirate, loafing together in 
purring contentment and letting 
the golden days drift by . . . 
until one night Mary stepped out 



to call the cat. When she came 
in, she was possessed. 

I could spot the tell tale hump 
under her negligee, could not fail 
to see the staring horror in her 
eyes. I tackled her — but Mary 
herself was a/so an agent, alsnost 
as strong as I was and just as 
skilled in the arts of rough-andtumble killing. I had to overcome 
her without killing her, without 
letting her kill me, and without 
letting the parasite touch me. As 
a desperate last resort I forced 
her shoulders over the open tire 
in the fireplace, burning her 
badly, but causing the parasite 
to drop to the floor. I was busy 
then putting out her burning hair 
and clothing. 

When I turned, the cat wan possessed by the parasite. I grubbed 
the cat, parasite and all. and 
forced them into the fire. I killed 
the Titan parasite, but in so doing 
killed my pet cat. I dug him a 
little grave, said good-by to him, 
and buried him. Then I sat beside Mary and waited fci her 
to waken from the shot ol sedative I had given her. 

XXIII 

About dawn Mary be n to 
struggle and moan. I put a i-^nd 
on her. "There, baby, it'-: all 
right. Sam's here." 

Her eyes opened and for a moment held the same horror. Then 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



103 



she saw me and relaxed. "Sam! 
Oh, darling, I've had the most 
terrible dream." 

"It's all right," 1 repeated. 

"Why are you wearing gloves?" 
She became aware of her own 
dressings; she looked dismayed 
and said, "It wasn't a dream!" 

"No, dearest, it wasn't a dream. 
But it's all right: I killed it." 

"You're sure?" 

"Quite sure." 

"Come here, Sam. Hold me 
tight." 

I did, while trying to be careful of her burns. Presently her 
trembling stopped. "Forgive me, 
darling — I'm weak and womanish." 

"You should have seen the 
shape I was in after I was possessed." 

"I did see. Now tell me what 
happened. The last I remember, 
you were trying to force me into 
the fireplace." 

"Look, Mary, I couldn't help 
it. I had to. There was no other 
way to get it oft." 

"I know, darling, and thank 
you for doing it! Again I owe you 
everything." 

She then cried and I blew my 
nose and went on, "You didn't 
answer when I called, so I went 
into the living room and there 
you were." 

"I remember. Oh. darling, I 
tried so hard!" 

I stared at her. "I know you 



did. You tried to leave. But how? 
Once a slug gets you, there's no 
way to fight it." 

"Well, I lost— but I tried." 
Somehow. Mary had forced her 
will against that of a parasite 
and that can't be done. I know. 
I had a sneaking hunch that 
had Mary not been able to resist 
the slug to some extent, however 
slight, I would have lost the 
struggle, handicapped as I was by 
fear of killing her, too. 

"I should have used a light, 
Sam," she added, "but it never 
occurred to me to be afraid nere," 
I nodded; this was the safe place, 
like crawling into bed or into 
sheltering arms. "Pirate came at 
once. I didn't see the slug until 
I had touched him. Then it was 
too late." She sat up. "Where is 
he, Sam? Is he all right? Call 
him." 

So I had to tell her about Pirate. She listened without expression, nodded and never referred 
to him again. I changed the subject by saying, "Now that you 
are awake, I had better fix you 
some breakfast." 

"Don't go/" I stopped. "Don't 
go out of my sight at alt," she 
begged, "not for any reason. I'll 
get breakfast." 

"The hell you will. You'll stay 
in bed like a good girl." 

"Come here and take off those 
gloves. I want to see your hands." 
I did not take them off — could 



104 




 



not bear to think about it; the 
anesthesia had worn off. She said 
grimly, "Just as I thought. You 
were burned worse than I was." 

So she got breakfast. Furthermore, she ate. I wanted nothing 
but coffee. I did insist that she 
drink a lot, too; large area burns 
dehydrate the body. Presently she 
pushed aside her plate and said, 
"Darling, I'm not sorry it happened. Now we've both been 
there." I nodded dumbly. Sharing 
happiness is not enough. She 
stood up and told me, "We must 
go." 

"Yes," I agreed. "I want to get 
you to a_ doctor as soon as possible." 

"I didn't mean that." 

"I know you didn't." There was 
no need to discuss it; we both 
knew the music had stopped and 
it was time to go back to work. 
The heap we had arrived in was 
still sitting on my landing flat, 
piling up rental charges. It took 
about three minutes to burn the 
dishes, switch off everything, and 
get ready. 

Mary drove, because of my 
hands. Once in the air she said, 
"Let's go straight to the Section 
offices. We'll get treatment there 
and find out what has been going 
on — or are your hands hurting 
too badly? 7 ' 

"Suits," I said. I wanted to 
learn the situation and I wanted 
to get back to work. I asked Mary 

THE PUPPET MASTERS 



to switch on the squawk screen 
to catch a newscast, But the car's 
communication equipment was as 
junky as the rest of it; we could 
not even pick up audio. Fortunately the remote control circuits 
were okay, or Mary would have 
had to buck traffic on manual. 

A thought had been fretting 
me; I mentioned it to Mary. "A 
slug wouldn't mount a cat just 
for the hell of it, would it?" 

"I suppose not." 

"But why? It has to make 
sense; everything they do makes 
sense, from their viewpoint." 

"But it did make sense. They 
caught a human that way." 

"Yes, I know. But how could 
they plan it? Surely there aren't 
so many of them that they can 
afford to gamble like that. Or 
are there?" I remembered Kansas 
Gity, saturated, and shivered. 
"Where did the slug come from? 
It had to get to the Pirate on the 
back of another host. What host? 
1% say it was Old John — John the 
Goat. Pirate wouldn't let any 
other human get close to him." 

"Old John?" Mary closed her 
eyes, thought hard, then opened 
them. "I can't get any feeling 
about it. I was never close to 
him." 

"By elimination I think it must 
be true. Old John wore a coat 
when everyone else was complying with the bareback order. Ergo; 
he was hag-ridden before Sched
105 



ule Bareback. But why would a 
slug single out a hermit way up 
in the mountains?" 

"To cnpture you." 

"Me?" 

"To recapture you." 
It made some sense. Possibly 
any host that ever escaped them 
was a marked man. In that case, 
the doi:en-odd Congressmen we 
had rescued were in special danger. I'd mark that down to turn 
in for analysis. 

On the other hand, the slugs 
might want me in particular. 
What was special about me? I 
was a secret agent. More important, the slug, that had ridden me 
knew what I knew about the Old 
Man, and was aware that I had 
access to him. I felt emotionally 
certain that the Old Man was 
their principal antagonist; the 
slug must have known that I 
thought so, for he had had full 
use of my mind. 

That slug had even met the Old 
Man, talked with him. Wait .... 
minute — that slug was dead. My 
theory came tumbling down. 

And built up again at once. 
"Mary," I asked, "have you used 
your apartment since the morning you and I had breakfast 
there?" 

"No. Why?" 

"Don't go back there for any 
purpose. 1 recall thinking, while 
I was with them, that I would 
have to boobytrap it." 



"Well, you didn't, did you?" 

"No, but it may have been 
boobytrapped since then. There 
may be the equivalent of Old 
John waiting, spider fashion, for 
you — or me — to return there." I 
explained to her Mcllvaine's 
"group memory" idea. "I thought 
at the time he was spinning the 
dream stuff scientists are so fond 
of. But now it's the only hypothesis I can think of that covers 
everything . . . unless we assume 
that the titans are so stupid that 
they would as soon fish in a bathtub as in a brook. Which they 
aren't." 

"Just a moment, dear. By Dr. 
Mcllvaine's theory, each slug is 
really every other slug; is that 
it? In other words, that thing 
that caught me last night was 
just as much the one that rode 
you when you were with them as 
was the one that actually did 
ride you — Oh, dear, I'm getting 
confused. I mean — " 

"You've got the general idea. 
Apart, they are individuals. In 
direct conference, they merge 
memories and Tweedledum becomes exactly like Tweedledee. 
If that is true, this one last night 
remembers everything learned 
from me, provided it has had 
direct conference with the slug 
that rode me, or a slug that had 
been linked through any number 
of slugs by direct conference to 
the slug that had ridden me, after

the time it did — which you can 
bet it did, from what I know of 
their habits. It would have — the 
first one, I mean. Wait a minute. Take three slugs; Joe, Moe 
and, uh, Herbert. Herbert is the 
one last night; Moe is the one 
which — " 

"Why give them names if they 
are not individuals?" Mary asked. 

"Just to keep them — no reason ; we'll just assume that if 
Mcllvaine is right, there may be 
millions of slugs who know exactly who we are. by name and 
sight and everything, know where 
your apartment is, where mine 
is, and where our cabin is. 
They've got us on a list," 

She frowned. "That's a horrid 
thought, Sam. How would they 
know when to find us at the 
cabin? We didn't tell anybody. 
Would they simply stake it out 
and wait?" 

"They must have. We don't 
know that waiting matters to a 
slug; time may mean something 
different to them." 

"Like Venerians," she suggested. I nodded; a Venerian is 
likely as not to "marry" his own 
great-great-granddaughter — and 
be younger than she is. It depends 
on how they estivate, of course. 

"In any case," I went on, "I've 
got to report this, including our 
guesses, for the boys in the analytical group to play with," 

I was about to go on to say 



that the Old Man would have to 
be especially careful, that it was 
probably he they were really after. But my secret phone embedded under my scalp sounded 
for the first time since leave had 
started. I answered and the Old 
Man's voice cut in ahead of the 
talker's: "Report in person." 

"On our way," I acknowledged. 
"About thirty minutes." 

"Make it sooner. You use Kay 
Five; tell Mary to come in by 
Ell One. Move!" He switched off 
before I could ask him how he 
had known that Mary was with 
me. 

"Did you get it ?" I asked 
Mary. 

"Yes, I was in the circuit." 
"Sounds as if the party was 
about to start." 

"JVTOT until we had landed did 
' I begin to realize how wildly 
the situation had changed. We 
were complying with Schedule 
Bareback; we had not heard of 
Schedule Suntan. Two cops stopped us as we got out. ' ' Sta nd 
still !" one of them ordered. "Don't 
make any sudden moves." 

You would not have known 
they were cops, except for the 
manner and the drawn guns. 
They were dressed in gun belts, 
shoes, and skimpy breech clouts. 
A second glance showed their 
shields clipped to their belts. 
"Now," the same one went on. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

"off with those pants, buddy." 

I did not move quickly enough. 
He barked, "Make it snappy! 
Two have been shot trying to 
escape today; you may be the 
third." 

"Do it, Sam," Mary said 
quietly. I did it. It left me dressed 
in shoes and gloves, feeling like 
a fool — but I managed to keep 
my gun covered as I took off my 
shorts. 

The cop made me turn around. 
His mate said, "He's clean. Now 
the other one." I started to put 
on my shorts; the first cop stopped me. 

"Locking for trouble? Leave 
'em off." 

I said reasonably, "I don't 
want to get picked up for indecent exposure." 

He looked surprised, then guffawed and turned to his mate. 
"You hear that. Ski?" 

i ; second one said patiently, 
"Listen, you got to cooperate. 
You know the rules. You can 
wear a fur coat for all of me — 
but you'll get picked up D.O.A. 
The vigilantes are a lot quicker 
to shoot than we are." He turned 
to Mary. "Now, lady, if you 
please." 

Without argument Mary 
started to remove her shorts. The 
second cop Sf'd kindly, "That 
isn't necessary, Ir.dy, not the way 
those things are built. Just turn 
•round slowly," 



"Thank you," Mary said and 
complied. The policeman's point 
was well taken; Mary's briefies 
and halter appeared to have been 
sprayed on. 

"How about those bandages?" 
the first one commented. 

I answered, "She's been badly 
burned. Can't you see that?" 

He looked doubtfully at the 
sloppy, bulky job I had done on 
the dressings. "Mrmnm," he said, 
"if she was burned." 

"Of course she was burned!" 
I felt my judgment slipping; I 
was the perfect heavy husband, 




108 GAIAXY SCIINCf FICTION 



unreasonable where my wife was 
concerned. "Damn it, look at her 
hair! Would she ruin a head of 
hair like that just to fool you?" 

The first cop said darkly, "One 
of them would." 

The more patient one said, 
"Carl is right, I'm sorry, lady; 
we'll have to disturb those bandages." 

I said excitedly, "You can't 
do that! We're on our way to a 
doctor. You'll just — " 

Mary said, "Help me unroll 
the bandages, Sam." 

I shut up and started to peel 



up one corner of the dressing, my 
hands trembling with rage. Presently the older one whistled and 
said, "I'm satisfied. How about 
you, Carl?" 

"Me, too, Ski. Cripes, girlie,, 
what happened?" 

"Tell them, Sam." 

So I did. The older cop finally 
commented, "So it's cats now. 
Dogs I knew about. Horses, yes. 
But you wouldn't think the ordinary cat could carry one." His 
face clouded. "We got a cat and 
now we'll have to get rid of it, 
My kids won't like that."

"I'm sorry," Mary told him. 

"It's a bad time for everybody. 
Okay, folks, you can go." 

"Wait a minute," 1 the first one 
said. "Ski, if she goes through 
the streets with that thing on her 
back, somebody is likely to burn 
her." 

The older one scratched his 
chin. "That's true. We'll just have 
to dig up a prowl car." 

Which they did. I had to pay 
the charges on the rented wreck, 
then went along as far as Mary's 
entrance. It was in a hotel 
through a private elevator; I got 
in with her to avoid explanations, 
then went back up after she got 
out at a level lower than the 
obvious controls of the car provided for. I was tempted to go 
in with her, but the Old Man had 
ordered me to come in by Kay 
Five. 

I was tempted, too, to put my 
shorts on. In the prowl car and 
during a quick march through 
a side door of the hotel, with 
police around us to keep Mary 
from being shot, I had not minded 
much — but it took nerve to face 
the world without pants. 

I need not have worried. The 
short distance I had to go was 
enough to show me that a basic 
custom had gone with last year's 
frost. Most men were wearing 
clouts, but I was not the only 
man naked to his shoes. One in 
particular I remember; he was 



leaning against a street roof 
stanchion and searching with cold 
eyes every passerby. He was 
wearing nothing but slippers and 
a brassard lettered "vig" and he 
was cradling an Owens mob gun. 
I saw three more like him; I was 
glad that I was carrying my 
shorts. 

Few women were naked, but 
the rest might as well have been 
— string brassieres, translucent 
trunks* nothing that could hide 
a slug. Most of the women would 
have looked better in togas. That 
was my first impression, but before long even that had worn off. 
Ugly bodies weren't any more 
noticeable than ugly taxicabs; the 
eye ignored them. Skin was skin 
and what of it? 

1 was let in to see the Old Man 
at once. He looked up and 
growled, "You're late." 

I answered, "Where's Mary?" 

"In the infirmary, getting 
treated and dictating her report. 
Let's see your hands." 

"I'll show them to the doctor, 
thanks. What's up?" 

"If you would ever bother to 
listen to a newscast," he grumbled, "you would know what was 
up."

HAD Mary and I watched the 
stereo, our honeymoon would 
never have gotten to first base. 



MO 




 



My suspicion that the slugs could 
hide themselves on any part of 
the body and still control hosts 
had been correct; it had been 
proved by experiment before 
Mary and I had holed up on the 
mountain, although I had not 
seen the report. I suppose the Old 
Man knew it. Certainly the President and the high brass did. 

So Schedule Suntan replaced 
Schedule Bareback and everybody skinned down to the buff — 
Like hell they did! The matter 
was still "Top Secret" at the time 
of the Scranton Riot. Don't ask 
me why ; our government has 
gotten the habit of classifying 
information, practically all information, a Mother - Knows Best-Dear policy. The Scranton 
Riot should have convinced anybody that the slugs were loose 
in Zone Green, but even that did 
not bring on Schedule Suntan. 

The fake air raid alarm on the 
East Coast took place, as I figure 
it, the third day of our honeymoon; afterward it took a while 
to figure out what had hapened, 
even though it was obvious that 
lighting could not fail by accident in so many different shelters. 
It gives me horrors to think about 
it — all those people crouching in 
the darkness, waiting for the 
all-clear, while zombies moved 
among them, slapping slugs on 
them. Apparently in some air 
raid bunkers the recruitment was 



one hundred per cent. 

So there were more riots the 
next day and we were well into 
the Terror. Technically, the start 
of vigilantism came the first time 
a desperate citizen pulled a gun 
on a cop — Maurice T. Kaufman 
of Albany was the citizen, and 
the cop was Sergeant Malcolm 
MacDonald. Kaufman was dead 
a half second later and MacDonald followed him. torn to pieces 
by the mob, along with his titan 
master. But the vigilantes did not 
really get going until the air raid 
wardens put organization into the 
movement. 

The wardens, being stationed 
above ground during raids, largely escaped, but they felt responsible. Not that all vigilantes were 
wardens, but a stark naked, 
armed men on the street was as 
likely to be wearing a warden's 
armband as the VK3 brassard. 
Either way, you could count on 
him shooting at any unexplained 
excrescence on a human body — 
shoot and investigate afterward. 

WHILE my hands were 
dressed, I was brought up 
to date. The doctor gave me s 
short shot of tempus and I spent 
the time — subjective, about three

et some of the colleges around 
examination week. You adjust the 
speed to match your subjective 
rate and use an audio frequency 
stepdown to let you hear what is 
being said. It is hard on the eyes, 
but it is a big help in cramming. 

It was hard to believe that so 
much could have happened. Take 
dogs. A vigilante would kill a 
dog on sight, even though it was 
not wearing a slug — because it 
was even money that it would be 
wearing one before sunrise, that 
it would attack a man and that 
the titan would change riders in 
the dark. 

A hell of a world where you 
could not trust dogs! 

Apparently cats were hardly 
ever used ; poor old Pirate was 
an exception. But in Zone Green 
dogs were rarely seen now by 
day. They filtered out of Zone 
Red at night, traveled in the dark 
and hid out at dawn. They kept 
showing up even on the coasts. 
It made one think of werewolf 
legends. 

I scanned dozens of tapes which 
had been monitored from Zone 
Red. They fell into three time 
groups: the masquerade period, 
when the slugs had been continuing the "normal" broadcasts; 
a short period of counter -propaganda, during which the slugs 
had tried to convince citizens in 
Zone Green that the government 
had gone crazy; and the current 



period in which pretense had 
dropped. 

According to Dr. Mcllvaine, 
the titans have no true culture; 
they are parasitic even in that 
and merely adapt the culture they 
find. Maybe he assumes too much, 
but that is what they did in 
Zone Red. The slugs would have 
to maintain the basic economic 
activity of their victims, since the 
slugs would starve if the hosts 
did. They continued that economy with variations that we 
would not use — that business of 
processing damaged and excess 
people in fertilizer plants, for example — but in general farmers 
stayed farmers, mechanics went 
on being mechanics, and bankers 
were still bankers. That last 
seems odd, but experts claim that 
any "division-of-labor" economy 
requires an accounting system. 

But why did they continue 
human recreations? Is the desire 
to be amused a universal need? 
What they picked from human 
ideas of fun to keep and "improve 
on" does not speak well for us, 
although some of their variations 
may have merit. That stunt they 
pulled in Mexico, for example, of 
giving the bull an even break with 
the matador. 

But most of it just makes one 
sick and I won't elaborate. I am 
one of the few who saw even 
transcriptions on such things; I 
saw them professionally. I hoped

that Mary, in her -briefing, did not 
have to look at them, but Mary 
would never say so if she had. 

There was one thing I 
saw in the tapes so outrageous, 
so damnably disgusting that I 
hesitate to mention it, though I 
feel I must. There were men and 
women here and there among the 
slaves, humans — if you could 
call them that — without slugs. 

I hate slugs, but I would turn 
from killing a slug to kill a renegade. 

WE were losing ground everywhere; our methods were 
effective only in stopping their 
spread, and not fully effective in 
that. To fight them directly we 
would have to bomb our own 
cities, with no certainty of killing 
the titans. What we needed was 
a weapon that would kill slugs 
but not men, or something that 
would disable humans or render 
unconscious without killing and 
thereby permit us to rescue our 
compatriots. No such weapon was 
available, though the scientists 
were all busy on the problem. A 
"sleep" gas would have been perfect, but it is lucky that no such 
gas was known before the invasion, or the slugs could have used 
it against us. It must be remembered that the slugs then had as 
much, or more, of the military 
potential of the United States at 
their disposal as had the free men. 



Stalemate — With time on their 
side. There were fools who wanted 
to H-bomb the cities of the Mississippi Valley out of existence, 
like curing a lip cancer by cutting 
off the head, but they were offset 
by their twins who had not seen 
slugs, and felt that the whole matter was a tyrannical Washington 
plot. The second sort grew fewer 
each day, not because they 
changed their minds but because 
the vigilantes were awfully eager. • 

Then there was the tertium 
quid, the flexible mind, the "reasonable" man — he favored negotiation, claiming we could "do 
business" with the titans. One 
such committee, a delegation 
from the caucus of the opposition 
party in Congress, actually tried 
it. Bypassing the State Department, they got in touch with the 
Governor of Missouri via a linkage rigged across Zone Amber, 
and were assured of safe conduct and diplomatic immunity— 
"guarantees" from a titan, but 
they accepted them. They went 
to St. Louis and never came back. 
They sent messages, though. I ■ 
saw one, a rousing speech adding 
up to, "Come on in, the water is 
fine!" 

Do steers sign treaties with 
meat packers? 

NORTH America was still the 
one known center of infection . The only action by the 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



ni 



United Nations, other than placing the space stations at our disposal, was to move to Geneva. 
It was voted, with twenty-three 
nations abstaining, to define our 
plight as "civi! disorder" and to 
urge each member nation to give 
such aid as it saw fit to the legitimate governments of the United 
States. Mexico, and Canada. 

It remained a creeping war, 
silent, with battles lost before we 
even knew they were joined. Conventional weapons were hardly 
useful except in policing Zone 
Amber, now a double no-man'sland from the Canadian forests 
to the Mexican deserts. It was 
deserted in the daytime, save for 
our own patrols. 

At night our scouts drew back 
and the dogs came through — and 
other things. 

Only one atom bomb had been 
used in the entire war, and that 
against a Saucer which landed 
near San Francisco south of Burlingamc. Its destruction was according to doctrine, but the 
doctrine was under criticism; it 
should have been captured for 
study. I found my sympathies 
with those who wanted to shoot 
first and study later. 

By the time the dose of tempus 
was wearing off, I had a picture 
of the United States in a shape 
that I had not imagined even 
when I was in Kansas City . . . 
a country undergoing Terror. 

114 I 



Friend might shoot friend, wife 
denounce husband. Rumor of a 
titan could drum up a mob on 
any street, with Judge Lynch 
baying in the van. To rap on a 
door at night was to invite a 
blast through the pane. Honest 
folk stayed home; at night the 
dogs were out. 

The fact that most of the rumored discoveries of slugs were 
baseless made them no less dangerous. It was not exhibitionism 
which caused many people to 
prefer outright nudity to the tight 
and scanty clothing permitted 
under Schedule Suntan; even the 
skimpiest clothing invited a suspicion that might be decided too 
abruptly. The head - and - spine 
armor was never worn now; the 
slugs had faked it and used it 
almost at once. 

And there had been the case 
of a girl in Seattle. She had been 
dressed in sandals and a big 
purse, nothing else. But a vigilante who apparently had developed a nose for the enemy 
followed her, and noticed that 
she never moved the purse from 
her right hand, even when she 
opened it to make change. She 
lived, for he burned her arm off 
at the wrist, and I suppose that 
she had a new one grafted on; 
the supply of such spare parts 
was a glut. The slug was alive, 
too, when the vigilante opened 
the purse — but not for long. 


 



The drug had worn) off by the 
time I scanned this incident and 
I mentioned the matter to the 
nurse. "Mustn't worry," she told 
me. "It does no good. Now flex 
the fingers of your right hand, 
please.*' 

I flexed them, while she helped 
the doctor spray on surrogate 
skin. "Wear gloves for rough 
work," the doctor cautioned, "and 
come back next week." I thanked 
them and went to the operations 
office. I looked for Mary first, 
but she was busy in Cosmetics. 

XXV 

"TTANDS all right?" the Old 
Man asked. 

"They'll do. False skin for a 
week. They do a graft job on my 
ear tomorrow." 

He looked vexed. "There's no 
time for a graft to heal; Cosmetics will have to fake one." 

"The ear doesn't matter," I told 
him, "but why bother to fake it? 
Impersonation job?" 

"Not exactly. Now that you've 
been briefed, what do you think 
of the situation?" 

I wondered what answer he 
was fishing for. "Not good," I 
conceded. "Everybody watching 
everybody else. Might as well be 
in Russia." 

"Speaking of Russia, would 
you say that it was easier to penetrate and maintain surveillance 



in Russia or in Zone Red? Which 
would you rather tackle?" 

I eyed him suspiciously. 
"What's the catch? You don't 
let a man pick his assignment." 

"I asked your professional 
opinion." 

"I don't have enough data. 
Have the slugs infested Russia?** 

"That," he answered, "is what, 
I must find out." 

I realized suddenly that Mary 
had been right; agents should not 
marry. "This time of year," I 
said, "I think I'd want to enter 
through Canton. Unless you were 
figuring on a drop." 

"What makes you think I want 
you to go there?" he asked. "We 
might find out quicker and easier 
in Zone Red." 

"What? How?" 

"Certainly. If there is infection 
anywhere but in this continent, 
the titans in Zone Red must know 
it. Why go half around the globe 
to find out?" 

I put aside the plans I had 
been forming to be a Hindu merchant, traveling with his wife, 
and thought about what he was 
saying. 

"How in the devil can Zone 
Red be penetrated now?" I asked. 
"Do I wear a plastic imitation 
slug on my shoulders? They'd 
catch me the first time I was 
called on for direct conference." 

"Don't be a defeatist. Four 
agents have gone in already." 



THS PUPPET MASTERS 



115 



"And come back?" 

"Well, not exactly." 

"Have you decided that I've 
cluttered up the payroll long 
enough?" 

"I think the others used the 
wrong tactics — " 

"Yeah, I'd say so." 

"The trick is to convince them 
that you are a renegade. Got any 
ideas?" 

The idea was so overwhelming 
that I did not answer at once. 
Finally I burst out, "Why not 
start me easy? Can't I impersonate a Panama pimp for a 
while? Or practice being an axe 
murderer? I have to get in the 
mood for this." 

"You've had more experience 
With their ways than any agent 
I've got. You must be rested up, 
aside from that little singe on 
your fingers. Or maybe we should 
drop you near Moscow and let 
you take a direct look. Think it 
over. Don't get into a fret about 
it for a day or so." 

"Thank you too much." I 
changed the subject. "What have 
you got planned for Mary?" 

"Why don't you stick to your 
own business?" 

"I'm married to her." 

"I know." 

"Well, for the love of Pete, 
don't you even want to wish me 

luck?" 

"It strikes me," he said slowly, 
"that yo.u have had all the luck 

116 



one man could ask for. You have 
my blessing, for whatever it's 
worth." 

"Oh." Up to that moment, it 
had not occurred to me that the 
Old Man might have had something to do with Mary's leave 
and mine falling together so conveniently. I said, "Look here. 
Dad—" 

"Huh?" It was the second time 
I had called him that in a month; 
it put him, on the defensive. 

"You meant for Mary and me 
to marry all along. You planned 
it that way." 

"Don't be ridiculous. I believe 
in free will, son — and free choices. 
Both of you were entitled to leave. 
The rest was accidental." 

"Accidents don't happen; not 
around you. Never mind, I'm 
satisfied with the outcome. Now 
about the job — give me a bit 
longer to size up the possibilities. 
Meantime, I'll see Cosmetics 
about a rubber ear." 

XXVI 

WE finally decided not to attempt to penetrate Zone 
Red. The evaluation group had 
advised there was no chance of 
impersonating a renegade : the 
question hinged on, "How does a 
man get to be a renegade? Why 
do the titans trust him?" It answers itself ; a slug knows its 
host's mind. If a titan, through 

AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



possessing a man's mind, -knows 
that he is a natural renegade, a 
man who can be had, then it may 
suit the slug's purposes to let him 
be renegade rather than host. But 
first the slug had to plumb the 
vileness in the man's mind and 
be sure of its quality. 

We concluded this from logical 
necessity. Human logic, but it had 
to be slug logic, too, since it fitted 
what the slugs could and could 
not do. As for me, it was not possible even under deep hypnotic 
instruction to pass myself off as 
a candidate for renegade, or so 
the psycho lads decided, and to 
which I said, "Amen!" 

It may seem illogical that titans 
would "free" a host even though 
they knew that the host was the 
sort who could be owned. But in 
the renegades the slugs had a supply of "trustworthy" fifth columnists — "trustworthy" is not the 
right word, but no language has 
a word for this form of treachery. 
That Zone Green was being penetrated by renegades was certain, 
but it is often hard to tell a fifth 
columnist from a custard head, 
which made them hard to catch. 

So I got ready. I took under 
hynosis a refresher in the languages I would need, with emphasis on the latest shibboleth 
phrases; I was provided with a 
personality and given a load of 
money. The reporting equipment 
was a new model and a joy to 



have, ultra -microwave stuff hardly larger than a loaf of bread, and 
the power pack so well shielded 
that it would not make a Geiger 
counter even nervous. 

I had to drop through their 
screen, but it would be under a 
blanket of anti-radar "window" to 
give their search technicians fits. 
Once inside I had to make up my 
mind whether or not the Russian 
axis was slug-infested, then dictate a report to whatever space 
station was in sight. In line-ofsight, that is; I can't pick out a 
space station by eye, and I doubt 
those who say they can. Report 
made, I was free to walk, ride, 
crawl, sneak and/or bribe my way 
out if I could. 

But I never had a chance to 
use these preparations; the Pass 
Christian Saucer landed. 

IT was only the third to be seen 
" after landing. The Grinnell 
Saucer had been concealed by the 
slugs and the Burlingame Saucer 
was a radioactive memory. But 
the Pass Christian one was both 
tracked and seen on the ground. 

It was tracked by Space Station 
Alpha and recorded as an "extremely large meteorite." The 
mistake was caused by its great 
speed. The primitive radar of 
sixty-odd years ago had picked 
up Saucers many times, especially 
cruising at atmospheric speeds 
while scouting this planet. But 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



our modern radar has been "improved" to the point where Saucers could not be seen; our instruments are too specialized. 
Traffic block control sees atmospheric traffic only. The defense 
screen and fire control radars see 
only what they are supposed to 
see. The fine screen "sees" a range 
from atmospheric speeds up to 
orbiting missiles at five miles a 
second. The coarse screen overlaps the fine screen, starting down 
at the lowest missile speed and 
carrying on up to about ten miles 
per second. 

There are other setectivities, 
but none of them sees objects at 
speeds over ten miles per second 
— with the single exception of 
space station meteor-count radars, 
which are not military. Consequently the "giant meteor" was 
not associated with Flying Saucers until later. 

But the Pass Christian Saucer 
was seen to land. The submersible 
cruiser U.N.S. Robert Fulton on 
patrol of Zone Red out of 
Mobile was seven miles off Gulfport with only her receptors 
showing when the Saucer landed. 
The spaceship popped up on the 
screens of the cruiser as it dropped from outer space speedaround fifty-three miles per second, by the space station record 
—to a speed the cruiser's radars 
would accept. 

It came out of nothing, slowed 



to zero, and disappeared — but the 
operator had a fix on the last blip, 
a few miles away on the Missis-' 
sippi coast. The cruiser's skipper 
was puzzled. The track surely 
could not be a ship; ships don't 
decelerate at fifty gravities! It did 
not occur to him that that might 
not matter to a slug. He swung 
his ship over and took a look. 
His first despatch read: space* 

SHIP LANDED BEACH WEST OF PASS 
CHRISTIAN MISSISSIPPI. HlS second 
Was: LANDING FORCE BEACHING TO 
CAPTURE. 

If I had not been in the Section 
offices preparing for my drop, I 
might have been left out of the 
party. As it was, my phone 
shrilled; I bumped my head on 
the study machine and swore. 
The Old Man said, "Come at 
once. Move!" 

It was the same party we had 
started with so many weeks — or 
years? — before, the Old Man, 
Mary and myself. We were heading south at emergency maximum 
before the Old Man told us the 
reason. 

When he did, I said, "Why the 
family group? You need a fullscale atr task force." 

"It will be there," he answered 
grimly. Then he grinned his old 
wicked grin. "What do you care? 
The 'Cavanaughs* are riding 
again. Eh, Mary?" 

I snorted. "If you want that 
sister and -brother routine, you

had better get another boy." 

"Just the part where you protect her from dogs and strange 
men," he answered soberly. "And 
1 do mean dogs and I do mean 
very strange men. This may be 
the payoff, son." 

He went into the operator's 
compartment, closed the panel, 
and got busy at the communicator. I turned to Mary. She 
snuggled up and said, "Howdy, 
Bud." 

I grabbed her. "Don't give me 
that 'Bud* stuff or somebody's 
going to get a paddling." 

WE were almost shot down by 
our own boys. Then we 
picked up an escort of two Black 
Angels who turned us over to the 
command ship from which Air 
Marshal Rexton was watching the 
action. The command ship 
took us inboard with an anchor 
loop. I found the maneuver disconcerting. 

Rexton wanted to spank us and 
send us home, but spanking the 
Old Man is a chore. They finally 
unloaded us and I squatted our 
car down on the seawall roadway 
west of Pass Christian — scared 
silly, I should add: we were buffeted by A. A. on the way down. 
There was fighting all around and 
above us, but there was a curious 
calm near the Saucer itself. 

The outlander ship loomed up 
almost over us, not fifty yards 



away. It was as convincing and as 
ominous as the plastic-board fake 
in Iowa had been phony. It was 
a discus of great size, tilted slightly toward us; it had grounded 
partly on one of the high-stilted 
old mansions which line that 
coast. The Saucer was partly 
supported by the wreckage and 
by the thick trunk of a tree that 
had shaded the house. 

Its canted attitude let us see 
the upper surface and what was 
surely its airlock — a metal hemisphere, a dozen feet across, at its 
center. This hemisphere was lifted 
out or up from the body of the 
ship some six or eight feet. I could 
not see what held it out, but I 
assumed that there must be a central shaft or piston; it came out 
like a poppet valve. It was easy 
to see why the Saucer had not 
closed up again and taken off. 
The airlock was fouled, held open 
by a "mud turtle," one of those 
little amphibious tanks that were 
part of the landing force of the 
Fulton. 

Let me place this on record. 
The tank had been commanded 
by Ensign Gilbert Calhoun of 
Knoxville. With him was Powerman 2/c Florence Berzowski and 
a gunner named Booker T. W. 
Johnson. They were all dead, of 
course, before we got there. 

The car, as soon as I ronded. 
it, was surrounded by a landing 
force squad commanded by m 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



pink-cheeked lad who seemed 
anxious to shoot somebody, anybody. He was less anxious when 
he got a look at Mary, but he still 
refused to let us appoach the 
Saucer until he had checked with 
his tactical commander, who in 
turn consulted the skipper of the 
Fulton. We got an answer back in 
short time, considering that it was 
probably referred clear to Washington. 

While waiting, I watched the 
battle and was pleased to have 
no part of it. Somebody was going 
" to get hurt. A good many had already. There was a male body 
just behind the car — a boy not 
more than fourteen. He was still 
clutching a rocket launcher and 
across his shoulders was the mark 
of the beast. I wondered whether 
the slug had crawled away and 
was dying, or whether, perhaps, 
it had managed to transfer to the 
person who had killed the boy. 

Mary had walked west on the 
highway with the downy young 
naval officer while I was examining the corpse. The notion of a 
slug, possibly still alive, being 
around caused me to hurry to 
her. "Get back into the car," I 
said. 

She continued to look west 
alon^ the road. "I thought I 
might get in a shot or two," she 
answered, her eyes bright. 

"She's safe here," the youngster assured me. "We're holding 



them, well down the road." 

I ignored him. "Listen, you 
bloodthirsty little hellion," I 
snapped, "get back in that car 
before I break every bone in your 
body !" 

"Yes, Sam." She turned and 
did so. 

I looked back at the young 
salt. "What are you staring at?" 
I demanded. The place smelled 
of slugs and the wait was making 
me nervous. 

"Nothing much," he said, looking me over. "In my part of the 
country we don't speak to ladies 
that way." 

"Then why in hell don't you 
go back where you come from?" 
I answered and stalked away. The 
Old Man was missing, too; I did 
not like it. 

An ambulance, coming back 
from the west, ground to a halt 
beside me. "Has the road to 
Pascagoula been opened?" the 
driver called out. 

The Pascagoula River, thirty 
miles east of where the Saucer 
had landed, was roughly "Zone 
Amber" for that area. The town 
of that name was east of the 
river's mouth and in Zone Green, 
while sixty or seventy miles west 
of us on the same road was New 
Orleans, the heaviest concentration of titans south of St. Louis. 
Our opposition came from New 
Orleans. Our nearest base was in 
Mobile. 



120 




 



"I haven't heard," 1 told the 
driver. 

He chewed a knuckle. "Well, I 
made it through. Maybe I'll make 
it back." His turbines whined and 
he was away. I continued to look 
for the Old man. 

Although the ground fighting 
had moved from the site, the air 
fighting was all around us. I was 
watching vapor trails and trying 
to figure out who was what and 
how they could tell, when a big 
transport streaked into the area, 
put on the brakes with a burst of 
rato units, and spilled a platoon 
of sky boys. Again I wondered; it 
was too far away to tell whether 
they wore slugs or not. At least it 
came in from the east. 

I spotted the Old Man talking 
with the landing force commander. I went up and interrupted. 
"We ought to get out of here, 
boss. This place is due to be 
atom-bombed ten minutes ago." 

The commander answered. 
"Relax. The concentration does 
not merit even a pony bomb." 

I was about to ask him sharply 
how he knew that the slugs would 
figure it that way, when the Old 
Man interrupted. "He's right, 
son." He took my arm and walked me back toward the car. "He's 
right, but for the wrong reasons." 

"Huh?" 

"Why haven't we bombed the 
cities they hold? They don't want 
to damage that ship; they want 



it back. Get on back to Mary. 
Dogs and strange men- — remem* 
ber?" 

I shut up, unconvinced. I expected us all to be clicks in a 
Geiger counter any second. Slugs 
fought with gamecock recklessness, perhaps because they were 
really not individuals. Why 
should they be more cautious 
about one of their ships? They 
might be more anxious to keep it 
out of our hands than to save it. 

We had just reached the car 
and spoken to Mary when the 
still -damp youngster came trotting up. He saluted the Old Man. 
"The Commander says that you 
are to have anything you want, 
sir — anything at all!" 

From his manner I gathered 
that the answering despatch had 
been spelled out in flaming letters, accompanied by ruffles and 
flourishes. "Thank you, sir," the 
Old Man said mildly. "We merely want to inspect the captured 
ship." 

"Yes, sir. Come with me, sir.** 
He came with us instead, having 
difficulty deciding whether to escort the Old Man or Mary. Mary 
won. I followed, keeping my mind 
on watching out and ignoring the 
presence of the youngster. The 
country on that coast, unless gardened, is practically jungle; the 
Saucer lapped over into a brake 
of that sort and the Old Man 
took a shortcut through it. The 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



t21 



kid said, "Watch out, sir. Mind 
where you step." 
, I said, "Slugs?" 

He shook his head. "Coral 
snakes." 

At that point a poisonous 
snake would have seemed as 
pleasant as a honey bee, but I 
must have been paying some attention to his warning for I was 
looking down when I first heard 
a shout- Then, so help me, a 
Bengal tiger was charging us! 

Probably Mary got in the first 
shot," Mine was not behind that of 
the young officer; it might even 
have been ahead. The Old Man 
shot last. Between us we cut that 
beast so many ways that it would 
never make a rug. And yet the 
slug on it was untouched; I fried 
it with my second bolt. 

The young fellow looked at it 
Without surprise. "Well," he said, 
"I thought we had cleaned up 
that load." 

"What do you mean?" 

"One of the first transport 
tanks they sent out. Regular 
Noah's Ark. We were shooting 
everything from gorillas to polar 
bears. Say, did you ever have a 
water buffalo come at you?" 

"No, and I don't want to." 

"Not as bad as the dogs, really. 
If you ask me, those things don't 
have much sense." He looked at 
the slug, quite unmoved. 

We got out of there fast and 
onto the titan ship — which did 



not make me less nervous, but 
more. Not that there was anything frightening in the appearance of the ship itself, but its appearance wasn't right. While it 
was artificial, one knew without 
being told that it was not made 
by men. Why? I don't know. Its 
surface was dull mirror, not a 
mark on it — not any sort of mark; 
there was no way to tell how it 
had been put together. It was as 
smooth as a Jo block. 

I could not figure what it was 
made of . Metal? Of course, it had 
to be metal. But was it? You 
would expect it to be either bitterly cold or possibly intensely 
hot from its landing. I touched it 
and it was not anything at all, 
neither cold nor hot. I noticed another thing presently. A ship that 
size, landing at high speed, should 
have blasted a couple of acres. 
There was no blast area at all; 
the brake around it was green and 
rank. 

We went up to the parasol 
business, the airlock, if that is 
what it was. The edge was jammed down on the little mud turtle; the armor of the tank was 
crushed in, as one might crush a 
pasteboard box with the hand. 
Those mud turtles are built to 
launch five hundred feet deep in 
water; they are strong. 

Well, I suppose this one was 
strong. The parasol arrangement 
had damaged it, but the airlock 




 



had not closed, On the other hand 
the metal, or whatever the spaceship's door was made of, was unmarked by the exchange. 

The Old Man turned to me. 
"Wait here with Mary." 

"You're going in there by yourself?" 

"Yes. There may be very little 
time," 

The kid spoke up. "I'm to stay 
with you, sir. That's what the 
Commander said." 

"Very well, sir," the Old Man 
agreed. "Come along." He peered 
over the edge, then knelt and 
lowered himself by his hands. The 
kid followed him. I felt burned 
up, but had no desire to argue the 
arrangements. 

Mary turned to me and said, 
"Sam, I don't like this. I'm 
afraid." 

She startled me. I was afraid 
myself, but I had not expected 
her to be. "I'll take care of you." 

"Do we have to stay? He didn't 
actually say so." 

I considered it. "If you want to 
go back to the car, I'll take you 
there." 

"Well . . . no, Sam, I guess we 
have to stay. Come closer to me.'* 
She was trembling. 

T DON'T know how long it was 
before they stuck their heads 
over the rim. The youngster 
climbed out and the Old Man 
told him to stand guard. "Come 



on," he said to us. "It's safe — I 
think." 

"The hell it is," I told him, but 
I went because Mary was already 
starting. The Old Man helped her 
down. 

"Mind your head," he said, 
"Low bridge all the way." 

It is a platitude that unhuman 
races produce unhuman works, 
but very few humans have ever 
been inside a Venerian labyrinth 
and still fewer have seen the Martian ruins — and I was not one of 
the few. I don't know what I expected. 

Superficially, the inside of the 
Saucer was hot, I suppose, too 
startling, but it was strange. It 
had been thought out by unhuman brains, ones which had 
never heard of the right angle and 
the straight line, or regarded them 
as unnecessary or undesirable. 

We found ourselves in a small 
oblate chamber, and from there 
we crawled through a tube about 
four feet thick, which seemed to 
wind down into the ship, ahd 
glowed from all its surface with 
a reddish light. 

The tube held an odd and 
somewhat distressing odor, ns if 
of marsh gas, and mixed with it 
faintly was the reek of dead slugs. 
That and the reddish glow and 
the total lack of heat response 
from the wall of the tube, as my 
palms pressed against it, gave me 
the unpleasant fancy that I was 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



crawling through the gut of some 
unearthly behemoth, rather than 
exploring a strange machine. 

The tube branched like an artery and there we came across our 
first Titanian androgyne. He — 
let me call it "he" — was sprawled 
on his back, like a child sleeping, 
his head pillowed on his slug. 
Theje was a suggestion of a smile 
on the little rosebud mouth. I did 
not realize that lie was dead. 

At first sight, the similarities 
between the Titanian people and 
ourselves are more noticeable 
than the differences; we impress 
what we expect to see on what we 
do see. Take the pretty little 
"mouth" for example — how was 
I to know that it was an organ 
for breathing solely? 

But despite the casual similarities of four limbs and a headlike 
protuberance, wc are less alike 
than a bullfrog and bullpup. 
Nevertheless the general effect is 
pleasing and faintly human. "Elfin," I should say— the elves of 
Saturn's moons. 

When I saw the little fellow, I 
managed to draw my gun. The 
Old Man turned and said, "Take 
it easy. It's dead. They are all 
dead, smothered in oxygen when 
the tank ruined their air seal." 

I still had my gun out. "I want 
to burn the slug," I insisted. "It 
may still be alive." It was not 
covered by the shell we had lately 
come to expect, but was naked 



and ugly. Very naked and ugly. 

He shrugged. "Suit yourself. It 
can't possibly hurt you. That slug 
can't live on an oxygen breather." 
He crawled across the little body, 
giving me no chance to shoot had 
I decided to. Mary had not 
drawn, but had shrunk against 
my side and was breathing in 
sharp, sobbing gasps. The Old 
Man stopped and said patiently, 
"Coming, Mary?" 

She choked, "Let's get out of 
here!" 

I said, "She's right. This is no 
job for three people. This is something for a research team and 
proper equipment." 

He paid no attention to me. "It 
has to be done, Mary. You know 
that. And you have to be the one 
to do it." 

"Why does she have to do it?" 
I demanded angrily. 

Again he ignored me. "Well, 
Mary?" 

From somewhere inside she 
called on reserves. Her breathing 
became normal, her features relaxed, and she crawled across the 
slug-ridden elfin body with the 
serenity of a queen going to the 
gallows. I lumbered after, still 
hampered by my gun and trying 
not to touch the corpse. 

We came at last to a large 
chamber which may have been 
the control room ; there were 
many of the dead little elfin creatures in it. Its inner surface wai

ca vita ted and picked out with 
lights much brighter than the reddish illumination, and the space 
was festooned with processes as 
meaningless to me as the convolutions of a brain. I was 
troubled again with the thought — 
completely wrong — that the ship 
itself was a living organism. 

The Old Man paid no mind but 
crawled through and into another 
ruddy-glowing tube. We followed 
its contortions to where it widened out to ten feet or more with a 
"ceiling" almost tall enougli to let 
us stand erect. But that was not 
what caught our eyes; the walls 
were no longer opaque. 

On each side of us, beyond 
transparent membranes, were 
thousands on thousands of slugs, 
swimming, floating, writhing in 
some fluid which sustained them. 
Each tank had an inner diffuse 
light of its own that let me see 
back into the palpitating mass — 
and I wanted to scream. 

I still had my gun out! The Old 
Man placed his hand over the 
bell of it. "You don't want to let 
that loose in here," he warned me. 
"Those are for us." 

Mary looked at them with a 
face too calm. I doubt that she 
was fully conscious in the ordinary sense. I looked at her, 
glanced back at the walls of that 
ghoulish aquarium, and said urgently, "Let's get out of here if 
we can, then just bomb it out of 



existence. Before it's too Iatc! M 

"No," he said quietly, "there is 
more. Come." The tube narrowed 
in again, then enlarged, and we 
were in a somewhat smaller 
chamber. Again there were transparent walls; again there were 
things floating beyond them. 

I had to look twice before I 
could believe what I saw. 

Floating just beyond the wall, 
face down, was the body of a man 
— a human, Earth-born man — 
about forty to fifty years old. His 
arms were curved across his chest 
and his knees were drawn up, as 
if he were sleeping. 

He was not alone : there were 
more beyond him, male and female, young and old, but be got 
my attention. I was sure that he 
was dead; it did not occur to me 
to think otherwise — then T saw 
his mouth working — and then I 
wished he were dead. 

TVJARY was wandering around 
as if she were drunk. No, not 
drunk, but preoccupied and 
dazed. She went from one wall to 
the other, peering into the crowded, half-seen depths. The Old 
Man looked only at her. "Well, 
Mary?" he asked softly. 

"I can't find them!" she said 
piteously in a voice like a little 
girl's. She ran back to the other 
side. 

The Old Man grasped her arm. 
** You're not looking for them in 



THE FUPPET MASTERS 



he whispered fiercely. "Keep out 
of this — you must keep out." 
"But — " 

"No!" He let go of Mary and 
led me to the entrance. "Stay 
there. And as you love your wife, 
as you hate the titans, do not in



terfere. I shan't hurt her. I promise." 

"What are you going to do?" 
But he had turned away. I stayed, 
unwilling, yet afraid to tamper 
with what I did not understand. 

Mary had sunk to the floor like 
a child, face covered with hands. 
The Old Man knelt down and 
touched her arm. "Go back," X 
heard him say. "Back to where it 
started." 

I could barely hear her answer. 
"No . . . no." 

"How old were you? You seemed to be about seven or eight 
when you were found. It was before that?" 

"Yes — yes, it was before that." 
She sobbed, "Mama! Mama!" 

"What is your mama saying?** 
he asked gently. 

"She doesn't say anything. 
She's looking* at me so queerly. 
There's something on her back. 
I'm afraid!" 

I hurried toward them, crouching to keep from hitting the low 
ceiling. Without taking his eyes 
off Mary, the Old Man motioned 
me back. I stopped, hesitated. 
"Go back," he ordered. "Way 
back." 

The words were directed at me 
and I obeyed them — but so did 
Mary. 

"There was a ship," she muttered, "a big, shiny ship — " He 
said something; if she answered, 
I could not hear it. I stayed back

this time. Despite my vastly disturbed emotions, I realized that 
something important was going 
on, something big enough to absorb the Old Man's full attention 
in the presence of the enemy. 

He continued to talk soothingly 
but insistently. Mary quieted, 
seemed to sink into lethargy. 
After a while she was talking in 
the monotonous logorrhea of 
emotional release. Only occasionally did he prompt her. 

1 heard something crawling 
along the passage behind me, 
turned and drew my gun, with a 
wild feeling that we were trapped. 
I almost shot him before I recognized the ubiquitous young officer we had left outside. "Come 
out!" he said urgently. He pushed 
past me into the chamber and 
repeated the demand to the Old 
Man. m 

The Old Man looked exasperated beyond endurance. "Shut up 
and don't bother me," he said. 

"You've got to, sir," the youngster insisted. "The Commander 
says that you must come out at 
once. We're falling back; he says 
he may have to use demolition at 
any moment. If we are still inside — blooie!" 

"Very well," the Old Man 
a-greed calmly. "Go tell your commander that he must hold off 
until we get out; I have vitally 
important information. Son, help 
me with Mary.** 



"Aye aye. sir!" the youngster 
acknowledged. "But hurry!" He 
scrambled away. I picked up 
Mary and carried her to where 
the chamber narrowed into a 
tube; she seemed almost unconscious. I put her down. 

"Mary," I shouted. "Mary! 
Can you hear me?" 

Her eyes opened. "Yes, Sam?" 

"Darling, we've got to get out 
of here, fast! Can you crawl?" 

"Yes, Sam." She closed her 
eyes. 

I shook her again. "Mary!" 

"Yes, darling? What is it? I'm 
so tired." 

"Listen, Mary, you've got to 
crawl out of here. If you don't, 
the slugs will get us. Do you 
understand?" 

"All right, darling." Her eyes 
stayed open, but were vacant. I 
got her headed up the tube and 
came after her. I lifted and dragged her through the chamber of 
slugs and again through the control room, if that's what it was. 
When we came to where the tube 
was partly blocked by the dead 
elfin creature, she stopped ; I 
wormed past her and stuffed it 
into the branching tube. There 
was no doubt, this time, that its 
slug was dead. 

After an endless nightmare of 
leaden-limbed striving, we reached the outer door. The young officer was there and helped us lift 
her out, him pulling and the Old 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTI ©-N 



Man and me lifting and pushing. 
I gave the Old Man a leg up, 

jumped out myself, and took her 
away from the youngster. 

It was quite dark as we went 
back past the crushed house, 
avoiding the brake, and thence 
down to the road. Our car was no 
longer there. We were hurried into 
a "mud turtle" tank — none too 
soon, for the fighting was almost 
on top of us. The tank commander buttoned up and the craft 
lumbered into the water. 

Fifteen minutes later we were 
inside the Fulton, and an hour 
later we disembarked at the Mobile base. 

The Old Man and I had had 
coffee and sandwiches in the 
wardroom of the Fulton. Some of 
the Wave officers had cared for 
Mary in the women's quarters. 
She joined us as we left and 
seemed normal. 

I said, "Mary, are you all 
right?" 

She smiled. "Of course, darling. Why shouldn't I be?" 

A command ship and escort 
took us out of there. I had supposed that we were headed back 
to the Section offices, or to Washington. The pilot put us into a 
mountainside hangar in one of 
those egg-on-a-plate maneuvers 
that no civilian craft can accomplish — in the sky at high 
speed, then in a cave and stationary. 

THE PU»PET MASTERS 



"Where are we?" I asked. 

The Old Man did not answer. 

He got out; Mary and I followed. 
The hangar was small, just parking space for a dozen craft, an 
arresting platform, and a single 
launching rack. Guards directed 
us on back to a door set in living 
rock; we went through and found 
ourselves in an anteroom. A loudspeaker told us to strip. I hated 
to part with my gun and phone. 
We went in and were met by a 
young fellow whose clothing was 
an armband showing three chevrons and crossed retorts. He turned us over to a girl who was wearing less — only two chevrons. Both 
of them noticed Mary, each with 
typical response. I think the 
corporal was glad to pass us on to 
the female captain who received 
us. 

"We got your message," the 
captain said. "Dr. Steelton is 
waiting." 

"Thank you, ma'am," the Old 
Man answered. "Where?" 

"Just a moment," she said, 
went to Mary and felt through 
her hair. "We have to be sure," 
she s#id apologetically. If she was 
aware of the falseness of much 
of Mary's hair, she did not mention it. "All right," she decided, 
"let's go." Her own hair was cut 
mannishly short. 

"Right," agreed the Old Man, 
"No, son, this is as far as you go." 

"Why?" I asked. 

1» 



"Because you damn near loused 
up the first try." » 

The captain said, "The officers* 
mess is down the first passageway 
to the left. Why not wait there?" 

So I did. I passed a door 
decorated primly in red skull and 
crossbones and stenciled with: 

WARNING 
LIVE PARASITES BEYOND THIS DOOR 

Qualified Personnel Only 
Use Procedure A 

I gave it a wide berth. 

The officers' mess had three or 
four men and two women lounging in it. I found an unoccupied 
chair, sat down and wondered 
who you had to be to get a drink 
around there. After a time I was 
joined by a large male extrovert 
Wearing a colonel's insignia on a 
neck chain. 

"Newcomer?" he asked. I admitted it. "Civilian expert?" he 
went on. 

"I don't know about 'expert'," 
I replied. "I'm a field operative." 

"Name? Sorry to be officious,** 
he apologized, "but I'm the security officer around here. My 
name's Kelly." 

I told him mine. He nodded. 
"Matter of fact I saw you coming 
in. Now, Mr. Nivens, how about 
a drink?" 

I stood up. "Whom do I have 
to kill to get it?** 



"AS far as I can see,*' Kelly 
went on later, "this place 
needs a security officer the way a 
horse needs rollerskates. We 
should publish our results as fast 
as we get them." 

I commented that he did not 
sound like a brass hat. He laughed. "Believe me, son. not all brass 
hats are as they are pictured. 
They just seem to be." 

I remarked that Air Marshal 
Rexton struck me as a pretty 
sharp citizen. 

"You know him?" the colonel 
asked. 

"Not exactly, but my work has 
thrown me in his company a bit. 
I last saw him earlier today." 

"Hmm," said the colonel. "I've 
never met the gentleman. You 
move in more rarefied strata than 
I do, sir." 

1 explained that it was mere 
happenstance, but from then on 
he showed me more respect. Presently he was telling me about the 
work the laboratory did. 

"By now we know more about 
those foul creatures than does Old 
Nick himself. But do we know 
how to kill them without killing 
their hosts? We do not. I'm no 
scientist-— just a cop under a different tag— but I've talked to the 
scientists here. This is a biological 
war. We need a bug, one that will 
bite the slug and not the host. 
Doesn't sound too hard, does it? 
We know a hundred things that 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



will kill the slug — smallpox, typhus, syphilis, encephalitis lethargies, Gbermayer's virus, 
plague, yellow fever, and so on. 
But they all kill the host, too." 

"Couldn't we use something 
that everyone is immune to?" I 
asked. "Everybody has typhoid 
shots. And almost everybody is 
vaccinated for smallpox." 

"No good. If the host is immune, the parasite doesn't get exposed to it. Now that the slugs 
have developed this outer cuticle, 
the parasite's environment is the 
host. No, we need something the 
host will catch and that will kill 
the slug, but won't give the host 
more than a mild fever." 

I started to answer when I saw 
the Old Man in the doorway. I 
excused myself and went to him. 
"What was Kelly grilling you 
about?" he asked. 

"He wasn't grilling me," I answered. 

"That's what you think. You 
know which Kelly that is? B. J. 
Kelly, the greatest scientific criminologist of our generation." 

"That Kelly! But he's not in 
the army." 

"Reserve, probably. But you 
can guess how important this lab 
is. Come on." 

"Where's Mary?" 

"You can't see her now. She's 
recuperating." 

"Is she — hurt?" 

"I promised you she would not 



be. Steelton is the best in his line. 
But we had to go down deep, 
against great resistance. That** 
always rough on the subject." 

"Did you get what you were 

after?" 

"Yes and no. We aren't 
through." 

"What were you after?" 

We had been walking along one 
of the place's endless underground passageways. Now he 
turned us into a small office, sat 
down, touched the desk communicator and said, "Private 
conference." 

"Yes. sir," a voice answered. 
"We wilt not record." A green 
light came on in the ceiling. 

"Not that I believe them," the 
Old Man complained, "but it 
may keep anyone but Kelly from 
playing it back. Well, I'll tell you 
a bit and answer your questions — 
some of them — in exchange for 
a solemn promise never to bother 
your wife with it. You don't have 
the skill to keep her from going 
into a wingding." 

"Very well, sir. I promise." 

"There were a group of people, 
a cult you might call them, that 
got into disrepute." 

"I know. The Whitmanites." 

"Eh? How did you know? 
From Mary? No, she couldn't 
have; she didn't know herself." 

"Not from Mary. I figured it 
out." 

He looked at me with odd re


THE PUPPET MASTERS

spect. "Maybe I've underestimated you, son. As you say, the 
Whitmanites. Mary was one, as a 
kid in Antarctica." 

"Wait a minute!" I said. "They 
left Antarctica in 1974." 

"Right." 

"But that would make Mary 
around forty years old!" 

"Do you care?" 

"Of course not, only she can't 
be." 

"She is and she isn't. Chronologically, her age is about forty. 
Biologically, she is in her middle 
twenties. Subjectively, she is even 
younger, because she doesn't consciously remember anything earlier than about 1990." 

"What do you mean? That she 
doesn't remember, I can understand — she never wants to remember. But what do you mean 
by the rest?" 

"What I said. She is no older 
than she is because— You know 
that room where she started to 
remember? She spent ten years 
or more H in suspended animation 
in just such a tank as that." 

*XVIII 

AS I get older, I don't get 
tougher: I get softer. The 
thought of my beloved Mary 
swimming in that artificial womb, 
neither dead nor alive, preserved 
like a pickled grasshopper, was 
too much for me. 



I heard the Old Man saying, 
"Take it easy, son. She's all 
right." 

I said, "Go ahead." 

Mary's overt history was simple, though mystifying. She had 
been found in the swamps near 
Kaiserville at the north pole of 
Venus — a little girl who could 
give no account of herself and 
who knew only her name, Allucquere. Nobody spotted the significance of the name, and a child 
of her apparent age could not be 
associated with the Whitmanite 
debacle in any case; the 1980 supply ship had not been able to find 
any survivor of their "New Zion" 
colony. Ten years of time and 
more than two hundred miles of 
jungle separated the little waif of 
Kaiserville from the God-struck 
colonists of New Zion. 

In 1990 an unaccounted-for 
Earth child on Venus was incredible, but there was no one 
around with the intellectual curiosity to push the matter. Kaiserville was made up of miners, doxies, company representatives of 
Two Planets Corporation, and 
nothing else. Shoveling radioactive mud in the swamps would 
not leave much energy for wonder. 

She grew up using poker chips 
for toys and calling every woman 
in crib row "mother" or "auntie.** 
They shortened her name to 
"Lucky." The Old Man did not 



132 




 



say who paid her way back to 
Earth; the real questions were 
where she had been from the time 
New Zion was eaten up by the 
jungle, and just what had happened to the colony. 

But the only record was buried 
in Mary's mind, locked tight in 
terror and despair. 

SOMETIME before 1980 — 
^ about the time of the Flying 
Saucer reports from Russo -Siberia — the titans had discovered 
New Zion colony. If you place it 
one Saturn year earlier than the 
invasion of Earth, the chronology 
fits fairly well. The titans probably were not looking for Earthmen on Venus; more likely they 
were scouting Venus as they had 
long scouted Earth. Or they may 
have known where to look. We 
know that they kidnapped Earthmen over the course of two or 
more centuries; they may have 
captured someone whose brain 
could tell them where to find New 
Zion. Mary's dark memories 
could contain no clue to that. 

Mary saw the colony captured, 
saw her parents turned into zombies who no longer cared for her. 
Apparently she herself was not 
possessed, or she may have been 
possessed and turned loose. the 
ti tans finding a weak and ignorant young girl an unsuitable 
slave. In any case, for what was 
to her baby mind an endless time, 



she hung around, unwanted, un
cared for, but unmolested, scavenging like a mouse. 

The slugs were moving in to 
stay; their principal slaves were 
Venerians and the colonists were 
only incidental. It is sure that 
Mary saw her parents being 
placed in suspended animation. 
For later use in the invasion of 
Earth? Possible. 

In due course she herself was 
placed in the tanks. Inside a titan 
ship? At a base on Venus? More 
probably the latter, for when she 
woke , she w as still on Venus. 
There are many gaps. Were the 
slugs that rode the Venerians 
identical with the slugs which 
rode the colonists? The slugs 
seem endlessly adaptable, but 
they have to adapt themselves to 
the biochemistry of their hosts. 
Had Venus an oxy-silicon econ-« 
omy like Mars, or a fluorine economy, the same parasite type could 
not have fed on both Venerians 
and Earth men. 

But the gist of the matter lay 
in the situation as it was when 
Mary was removed from the artificial incubator. The titan inva* 
sion of Venus had failed, or was 
failing. She was possessed as soon 
as they removed her from the 
tank — but Mary had outlived the 
slug that possessed her. 

Why had the slugs died? Why 
had the invasion of Venus failed? 
It was for clues to these that the

Old Man and Dr. Steelton had 
gone fishing in Mary's brain. 

1SAID, "Is that all?" 
"Isn't that enough?" 
"But it raises as many questions as it answers/' I complained, 
"There is a great deal more," he 
told me, "only you aren't a Venerian expert or a psychologist. 
I've told you what I have so that 
you will know why we have to 
work on Mary and won't question her about it. Be good to her, 
boy. She's had more than her 
share of grief." 

I ignored the advice; I can get 
along or not get along with my 
own wife without help, "What I 
can't see is why you had Mary 
linked up with Flying Saucers in 
the first place. I realize now that 
you took her along on that first 
trip on purpose. You were right — 
but why? And don't give me any 
malarkey." 

The Old Man looked puzzled. 
"Son, what is a 'hunch'?" 

"A belief that something is so, 
or isn't so, without evidence." 

"I'd call a hunch the result of 
unconscious reasoning on data 
you did not know you possessed." 

"Don't tell me your unconscious mind works on data you 
are going to get, but don't have." 

"Ah, but I did have data. 
What's the last thing that happeng^feo a candidate before he is 
certified as an agent?" 

134 



"The personal interview with 
you." 

"No, no!" 

"Oh, the trance analysis." I had 
forgotten hypnoanalysis for the 
simple reason that the subject 
never remembers it. "You mean 
you had this data on Mary then. 
It wasn't a hunch at all." 

"No again. I had a very little 
of it — Mary's defenses are strong. 
But I knew that Mary was the 
agent for this job. Later I played 
back her hypno interview; then I 
knew that there must be more. 
We tried for it and did not get it. 
But I knew that there had to be 
more." 

I thought it over. "You sure 
put her over the bumps to get it." 

"I had to. I'm sorry." 

"Okay, okay." I waited a moftient, then said, "Look, what was 
there in my hypno record?'* 

"I had my deputy play it. He 
said there wasn't anything I needed to know, so I never played it." 

"Well— thanks." 

He merely grunted.

rj^HE slugs had died from something they contracted on Venus; that much we thought we 
knew. We weren't likely to get 
another chance in a hurry to collect direct information, for a despatch came in while the Old Man 
and I were talking, saying that 

5ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the Pass Christian Saucer had 
been bombed to keep it from being recaptured. The Old Man had 
hoped to get at those human 
prisoners in that ship, revive and 
question them. 

That chance was gone. What 
they could dig out of Mary had 
better be the answer. If some infection peculiar to Venus was 
fatal to slugs but not fatal to 
humans — at least, Mary had 
lived through it — then the next 
step was to test them all and determine which one. Just dandy! 
The list of diseases native to 
Venus which are not fatal but 
merely nastily annoying is very 
long — from the standpoint of a 
Venerian bug. we must be too 
strange a diet. 

The problem was made harder 
by the fact that diseases native 
to Venus which were represented 
by cultures on Earth were strictly 
limited in number. Such an omission could be repaired — in a century or so of exploration and research on a strange planet. 

In the meantime, there was a 
breath of frost in the air; Schedule 
Suntan could not go on forever. 

The psych boys had to go back 
where they hoped the answer was, 
in Mary's brain. I did not like it, 
but I could not stop it. She did 
not appear to know why she was 
being asked to submit, over and 
over again, to hypnotics. Though 
she seemed serene, the strain 



showed — circles under her eyes, 
tremor, inattentiveness. Finally I 
told the Old Man that it had to 
stop. 

"You know better than that, 
son," he said. 

"The hell I do! If you haven't 
gotten what you want by now, 
you'll never get it." 

"If we don't succeed," he answered gently, "you'll wish to 
heaven that she had. Or do you 
want to raise kids to be hosts to 
titans?" 

I chewed my lip. "Why didn't 
you send me to Russia, instead of 
keeping me here?" 

"Oh, that — I want you here, 
with Mary, keeping her morale 
up, instead of acting like a spoiled 
brat. In the second place, it isn't 
necessary." 

"Huh? What happened? Some 
other agent report in?" 

"If you would ever show a 
grown-up interest in the news, 
you would know." 

I hurried out and brought myself up to date. This time I had 
managed to miss the first news of 
the only continentwide epidemic 
of Black Death since the 17th 
Century. 

I could not understand it. Russian public health measures were 
fairly good; they were carried out 
"by the numbers" and no nonsense tolerated. A country has to 
be literally lousy to * Spread 
plagues — rats, lice, and fleas, the

historical vectors. The Russian 
bureaucrats had even cleaned up 
China to the point where bubonic 
plague and typhus were localized. 

Now both plagues were spreading across the whole Sino-RussoSiberian axis, to the point where 
the government had broken down 
and pleas were being sent out for 
V. N. help. What had happened? 

I put the pieces together and 
looked up the Old Man again. 
'"Boss, there were slugs in Russia." 

"Yes." 

"You know? Well, for cripes 
sake, we'd better move fast, or 
the whole Mississippi Valley will 
be in the shape that Asia is in. 
Just one little rat — " The titans 
did not bother about human sanitation. I doubted if there had 
been a bath taken between the 
Canadian border and New Orleans since the slugs dropped the 
masquerade. Lice, fleas — 

The Old Man sighed. ''Maybe 
that's the solution.** 

"You might as well bomb them, 
if that's the best we have to offer. 
It's a cleaner way to die." 

"So it is. But you know we 
won't. As long as there is a chance 
we'll keep on trying." 

I mulled it over at length. We 
were in still another race against 
time. Fundamentally, the slugs 
must be too stupid to keep slaves; 
perhaps that was why they moved 
from planet to planet — they 



spoiled what they touched. After 
a while their hosts would die and 
then they needed new hosts. 

Theory, just theory. One thing 
was sure : Zone Red would be 
plague-ridden unless we found a 
way to kill the slugs, and that 
mighty soon! I made up my mind 
to do something I had considered 
before — force myself into the 
mind -searching sessions. If there 
were something in Mary's hidden 
memories which could be used to 
kill slugs, I might see it where 
others had failed. In any case I 
was going in, whether Steelton 
and the Old Man liked it or not. 
I was tired of being treated like 
a cross between a prince consort 
and an unwelcome child. 

XXX 

MARY and I had been living 
in a cubicle intended for one 
officer; we were as crowded as 
a plate of smorgasbord, but wc 
did not care. I woke up first the 
next morning and made my usual 
quick check to be sure that a slug 
had not gotten to her. While I 
was doing so, she opened her 
eyes and smiled drowsily. 
"Go back to sleep," I said. 
"I'm awake now." 
"Mary, do you know the incubation period for bubonic 
plague?*' 

She answered, "Should I know? 
Why, one of your eyes is slightly 



13* 




 



darker than the other. I never 
noticed before." 

I shook her. "Pay attention, 
wench. I was in the lab library 
last night, doing some figuring. 
As I get it, the slugs must have 
moved in on the Russians at least 
three months before they invaded 
us." 

"Yes, of course." 

"You know? Why didn't -you 
lay so?" 

"Nobody asked me." 

"Oh, for heaven's sake! Let's 
get up; I'm hungry." Before we 
left, I said, "Guessing games at 
the usual time?" 

"Yes." 

"Mary, you never talk about 
..ftp what they ask you." 

She looked surprised. "But I 
never know." 

"That's what I gathered. Deep 
trance with a 'forgetter' order, 
eh?" 

"I suppose so." 

"Hmm. Well, there'll be some 
Changes made. Today I am going 
with you." 

All she said was, "Yes, dear." 

They were gathered as usual 
in Dr. Steelton's office, the Old 
Man, Steelton himself, a Colonel 
Gibsy who was chief of staff, a 
lieutenant colonel, and an odd lot 
of sergeant-technicians, J.O.s and 
flunkies. In the army it takes an 
* eight-man working party to help 
a brasshat blow his nose. The 
Old Man's eyebrows shot up 



when he saw mc, but he said 

nothing. 

A sergeant tried to stop me. 
"Good morning, Mrs. Nivens," h( 
said to Mary, then told me, "1 
don't have you on the list." 

"I'm putting myself on thr 
list," I announced, and pushed or 
past him. 

Colonel Gibsy glared and 
turned to the Old Man with 
a "Hrrumph - what's - all - this?' 
noise. The rest looked frozenfaced, except one Wac sergeant 
who could not keep from grinning. 

The Old Man said to Gibsy. 
"Just a moment, Colonel," and 
limped over to me. In a voice 
that reached me alone, he said. 
"Son, you promised me." 

"And I withdraw it. You had 
no business exacting a promis* 
like that." 

"YouVe no business here, son. 
You are not skilled in these matters. For Mary's sake, get out." 

"You are the one with no business here. You are not an analyst. 
You get out." 

The Old Man glanced at Mary 
Nothing showed in her face. Th( 
Old Man said slowly, "You been 
eating raw meat, son?" 

I answered, "It's my wife who 
is being experimented on. From 
here on, I make the rules." 

Colonel Gibsy butted in. 
"Young man, art you out of your 
mind?"

I glanced at his hands. "That's 
a V.M.I, ring, isn't it? Have you 
any other qualifications? Are you 
an M. D.? A psychologist?" 

He drew himself up. "You seem 
to forget that this is a military 
reservation." 

"You forget that my wife and 
I aren't military personnel!" I 
added, "Come, Mary. We're 
leaving." 

"Yes, Sam." 

I said to the Old Man, 'Til 
tell the offices where to send our 
mail." I started for the door with 
Mary following. 

The Old Man said. "Just a moment." I stopped and he asked 
Gibsy, "Colonel, will you step 
outside with me? I'd like a word 
in private." 

Colonel Gibsy - gave me a general-court-martial look, but he 
went. We all waited. The juniors 
continued to be poker-faced, the 
lieutenant colonel looked perturbed, and the Wac sergeant 
seemed about to burst. Steelton 
was the only one who appeared 
unconcerned. He took papers out 
of li is "incoming" basket and 
went quietly to work. 

Ten or fifteen minutes later a 
sergeant came in. "Dr. Steelton, 
the Commanding Officer says to 
go ahead." 

"Very well, Sergeant," he acknowledged, then looked at me and 
said, "Let's go into the operating 
room." 



I said, "Not so fast. Who are 
these others? How about him?" 
I indicated the lieutenant colonel. 

"Eh? He's Dr. Hazelhurst. Two 
years on Venus." 

"Okay, he stays." I caught the 
eye of the sergeant with the grin 
and said, "What's your job, sister?" 

'Tm sort of chaperone." 

"I'm taking over the chaperone 
business. Now, Doctor, suppose 
you sort out the spare wheels 
from the people you actually 
need." 

"Certainly, sir.** It turned out 
that he really wanted no one but 
Colonel Hazelhurst. We went inside — Mary, myself, and the two 
specialists. 

The operating room contained 
a psychiatrist's couch surrounded 
by chairs. The double snout of a 
tri -dimension at camera poked out 
of the overhead. Mary went to 
the couch and lay down. 

Dr. Steelton got out an injector. "We'll try to pick up 
where we left off, Mrs. Nivens." 

I said, "Just a moment. You 
have records of the earlier attempts?'* 

"Of course." 

"Let's play them over first. I 
want to come up to date." 

He hesitated, then answered, 
"If you wish. Mrs. Nivens, I 
suggest that you wait in my 
office." 

It was probably the contrary 




 



mood that I was in; bucking the 
Old Man had gotten me hiked 
Up. 

"Let's find out first if she wants 
to leave." 

Steelton looked surprised. "You 
don't know what you are suggesting. These records would be emotionally disturbing to your wife." 

"Very questionable therapy," 
Hazel hurst put in. 

I said, "This isn't therapy and 
you know it. If therapy had been 
your object, you would have used 
eidetic recall techniques instead 
of drugs." 

"There was no time. We had 
to use rough methods for quick 
results. I'm not sure that I can 
authorize the subject to see the 
records." 

; I exploded. "Damn it, nobody 
asked you and you haven't got 
any authority in the matter. 
Those records were snitched out 
of my wife's head and they belong to her. She'll make up her 
own mind. Now ask her!" 

Steelton said, "Mrs. Nivens, do 
you wish to see your records?" 

Mary answered, "Yes, Doctor, 
I'd like to very much." 

He seemed astonished. "Do you 
wish to see them by yourself?" 

"With my husband. You and 
Dr. Hazelhurst are welcome to 
remain." 

They did. A stack of tape 
spools were brought in, each labeled with attributed dates and 



ages. It would have taken hours 
to go through them all, so I discarded those which concerned 
Mary's life after 1991; they could 
hardly affect the problem. 

We began with her very early, 
life. Each record started with, 
the subject, Mary, choking and 
groaning and struggling the way 
people always do when they are 
being forced back on a memory 
track which they would rather 
not follow. Then would come the 
reconstruction, both in her voice 
and in others. What surprised me 
most was Mary's face— in the 
tank, I mean. We had the magnification stepped up so that the 
stereo image was practically in 
our laps and one could follow 
every expression. 

First her face became that of 
a little girl — oh, her features were 
the same grown-up ones, but I 
knew that I was seeing my darling as she must have been when 
she was very small. It made me 
hope that we would have a little 
girl ourselves. 

Then her expression would 
change to match when other actors out of her memory took over. 
It was like watching an Incredibly 
able monologist playing many 
parts. 

Mary took it calmly, but her 
hand stole into mine. When we 
came to the terrible part where 
her parents changed, became 
slaves of slugs, she clamped down 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



139 



hard on my fingers. But she controlled herself. 

I skipped over the spools 
marked "period of suspended animation" and proceeded to the 
group concerned with the time 
from her resuscitation to the 
group concerned with her rescue 
from the swamps. 

One thing was certain: she had 
been possessed by a slug as soon 
as she was revived. The dead expression was that of a slug not 
bothering to keep up a masquerade ; the stereocasts from 
Zone Red were full of that look. 
The barrenness of her memories 
from that period confirmed it. 

Then, rather suddenly, she was 
no longer hag-ridden, but was 
again a little girl, very sick and 
f ri ghtened. There wa s a delirious quality to her remembered 
thoughts, until, at the last, a new 
voice came out loud and clear: 
"Welt, skin me alive ! Look, Pete, 
it's a little girl!" 

That tape carried on into 
Kaiserville, her recovery from 
starvation and exposure, and 
many new voices and memories; 
presently it ended. 

"I suggest," Dr. Steel ton said 
- as he took the tape out of the 
projector, "that we play another 
of the same period. They are all 
slightly different and this period 
is the key to the whole matter." 

"Why, Doctor?'* Mary asked. 

"If we could tell what killed 



the titan which, uh, possessed 
you before you were found — what 
killed it and left you alive — we 
might have the weapon we need." 

"But don't you know?" Mary 
asked wonderingly. 

"Not yet, but we'll get it. The 
human memory is an amazingly 
complete record." 

"I. thought you knew. It was 
nine-day fever." 

" What?" Hazelhurst bounced 
out of his chair. 

"Couldn't you tell from my 
face? It was characteristic — the 
mask, I mean, f used to nurse 
it back ho — back in Kaiserville, 
because I had had it once and 
was immune." 

Steelton said, "How about it. 
Doctor? Have you ever seen a 
case of it?" 

"By the time of the second expedition, they had the vaccine. 
I'm acquainted with its clinical 
characteristics, however." 

"But can't you tell from this 
record ?" 

"Well," Hazelhurst answered 
carefully, "I would say that what 
we have seen is consistent with 
it, but not conclusive." 

"What's not conclusive?" Mary 
said sharply. "I told you it was 
nine -day fever." 

"We must be sure," Steelton 
said apologetically. 

"How sure can you get? There 
is no question about it. I wai 
told that I had been sick with

it when Pete and Frisco found 
me. I nursed other cases later 
end I never caught it. I remember 
their faces when they were ready 
to die — just like my own face 
in the record. Anyone who has 
ever seen a case could not possibly mistake it for anything else. 
What more do you want?" 

I have never seen Mary so close 
to losing her temper — except once. 
I said to myself: look out, gentlemen, better duck! 

Steelton said, "I think you 
have proved your point, but tell 
me: You were believed to have 
no conscious memory of this 
period and my own examination 
of you confirmed it. Now you 
speak as if you had.'* 

Mary looked puzzled. "I remember it now, quite clearly. I 
haven't thought about it in many 
years." 

"I think I understand." He 
turned to Hazelhurst. "Well, Doctor, do we have a culture of the 
disease? Have your boys done 
any work on it?" 

Hazelhurst seemed stunned. 
"Work on it? Of course not! It's 
out of the question — nine-day 
fever! We might as well use polio 
or typhus. I'd rather treat a hangnail with an ax!" 

I touched Mary's arm. "Let's 
go, darling. I think we have done 
all the damage we can." She was 
trembling and her eyes were full 
of tears. I took her into the mess


room for systemic treatmentdistilled. 

A FTER bedding Mary down 
for a nap, I looked up my 
father in the office they had assigned him. 

He looked at me speculatively. 
"Well, Elihu, I hear you hit the 
jackpot." 

"I prefer to be called Sam," I 
answered. 

"Very well, Sam. Success is its 
own excuse; nevertheless, the 
jackpot appears to be disappointingly small. Nine-day fever — no 
wonder the colony died out and 
the slugs as well. I don't see how 
we can use it. We can't expect 
everyone to have Mary's remarkable resistance." 

He was right, of course. The 
fever carried a 98%-plus death 
rate among unprotected Earthmen, With those who had taken 
the shots, the rate was an effective 
zero — but that would be true of 
the slugs, too. 

"I can't see that it matters," I 
pointed out. "It's odds-on that 
you will have typhus or plague 
— or both — throughout the Mississippi Valley in the next six 
weeks." 

"Or the slugs may have learned 
a lesson in Asia and will start 
taking drastic sanitary measures." 
The idea startled me so that I 
almost missed the next thing he 
said, which was: "No, Sam, you'll

"/'// have to? I just work here.** 
"You did once. Now you've 
taken charge of this job." 

"What the devil are you talking about? I'm not in charge of 
anything and don't want to be. 
You are the boss." 

He shook his head. "A boss 
is the man who does the bossing. 
Titles and insignia come later. 
Tell me, do you think Oldfield 
could ever replace me?" 

I shook my head; Dad's chief 
deputy was the executive officer 
type, a "carry-outer," not a 
4 think-upper." "I've never promoted you," he went on, "because 
I knew that when the time came 
you would promote yourself. Now 
you've done it — by bucking my 
judgment, forcing your own on 
me, and by being right." 

"Rats! I got bull-headed and 
forced one issue. It never occurred to you big brains that you 
weren't consulting the one real 
Venus expert you had on tap — 
Mary. But I didn't expect to find 
out anything ; I had a lucky 
break." 

He shook his head. "Luck is a 
tag given by the mediocre to 
excuse for their mediocrity." 

I placed my hands on the desk 
and leaned toward him. "Okay, 
so I'm a genius — but you are not 
going to make me hold the sack. 
When this is over, Mary and I are 
going up in the mountains and 



raise kittens and kids, I don't intend to boss screwball agents." 

He smiled gently and didn't 
answer. 

"I don't want your job. Understand me?" 

"Don't take it so hard, Sam. 
I'll keep the title for the present. 
In the meantime, what are your 
plans — sir?" 

XXXI 

THE worst of it was that he 
meant it. I tried to go limp 
on him, but it didn't work. A toplevel conference was called that 
afternoon; I was notified, but 
stayed away. Shortly a polite little Wac came to tell me that 
the commanding officer was waiting and would I please come at 
once? 

So I went — and tried to stay 
out of the discussion. But my 
father has a way of conducting 
a meeting, even if he is not in 
the chair, by looking expectantly 
at the one he wants to hear from. 
It's a subtle trick; the group does 
not know that it is being led. 

But / knew. With every eye in 
the room on you, it is easier to 
voice an opinion than to keep 
quiet. Particularly when I found 
that I had opinions. 

There was much moaning and 
groaning about the impossibility 
of using nine-day fever. Admitted 
that it would kill slugs, but it 



142 




 



would even kill Venetians who 
can be chopped in two and survive, and it was sure death to 
almost any human. Seven to ten 
days after exposure — curtains. 

"Yes, Mr. Nivens?" It was the 
commanding general, addressing 
me. I hadn't said anything, but 
Dad*s eyes were on me, waiting. 

"I think there has been a lot 
of despair voiced at this session," 
I said, "and a lot of opinions 
given that were based on assumptions. The assumptions may not 
be correct." 

"How so?" • 

I did not have an instance in 
mind; I had been shooting from 
the hip. "Well, I hear constant 
reference to nine-day fever as if 
the nine-day part were an absolute fact. It's not." 

The boss brass shrugged impatiently. "It's a convenient tag. 
It averages nine days." 

"Yes, but how do you know 
it lasts nine days — for a stag?" 

By the murmur with which it 
was received, I knew that I had 
hit the jackpot again. 

I was invited to explain why I 
thought the fever might run a 
different time in slugs and why it 
mattered. I bulled on ahead. 

"In the only case we knew 
about, the slug did die in less 
than nine days — a lot less. Those 
of ycu who have seen the records 
on my wife — and I gather that 
entirely too many of you have — 



are aware that her parasite left 
her, presumably dropped off and 
died, long before the eighth -day 
crisis. If experiments confirm this, 
then the problem is different. A 
man infected with the fever might 
be rid of his slug in— oh, call it 
four days. That gives you five 
days to catch and cure him." 

The general whistled silently. 
"That's a pretty heroic solution, 
Mr. Nivens. How do you propose 
to cure him? Or even catch him? 
I mean to say, suppose we plant 
an epidemic in Zone Red. it 
would take incredibly fast footwork — in the face of stubborn 
resistance, remember — to locate 
and treat more than fifty million 
people before they died." 

I slung the hot potato right 
back, wondering how many "experts" had made their names by 
passing the buck. "The second 
question is a logistical and tactical problem — your problem. As 
to the first, there is your expert." 
1 pointed to Dr. Hazelhurst. 

Hazelhurst huffed and puffed 
and I knew how he felt. More research needed . . . experiments 
would be required . . . work had 
been done toward an antitoxin, 
but the vaccine for immunizing 
had proven so successful that he 
was not sure the antitoxin had 
ever been perfected. He concluded 
lamely by saying that the utudy 
of the exotic diseases of Venus 
was still in its infancy. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



•«3 



The general interrupted him. 
"This antitoxin business — how 
soon can you find out about it?" 

Hazelhurst said that there was 
a man at the Sorbonne he wanted 
to phone. 

"Do so," his commanding officer said. "You are excused." 

TTAZELHURST came buzzing 
at our door before breakfast 
the next morning. I stepped out 
into the passage to see him. 
"Sorry to wake you/' he said, 
"but you were right about that 
antitoxin matter." 
"I was?" 

"They are sending me some 
from Paris; it should arrive any 
minute. I do hope it's still potent." 

"And if it isn't?" 

"Well, we have the means to 
make it. We'll have to, of course, 
if this wild scheme is used — millions of units of it." 

"Thanks for telling me," I said. 
I started to turn away; he stopped me. 

"Uh, Mr. Nivens, about the 
matter of vectors — ** 

"Vectors?" 

"Disease vectors. We can't use 
rats or mice or anything like that. 
Do you know how the fever is 
transmitted on Venus? By a little 
flying rotifer, the Venerian equivalent of an insect. But we don't 
have any and that is the only 
Way it can be carried." 



"Do you mean to say you 
couldn ' t gi ve it to me if you 
tried?" 

"Oh, yes, I could inject you. 
But I can't picture a million paratroopers dropping into Zone Red 
and asking the parasite-ridden 
population to hold still while they 
gave them injections." 

Something started turning over 
slowly in my brain ... a million 
men in a single drop. "Why ask 
me?" I said. "It's a medical problem." 

"Of course. I just thought — 
Well, you seemed to have a ready 
grasp — " He paused. 

"Thanks." My mind was struggling with two problems at once 
and having traffic trouble. How 
many people were there in Zone 
Red? "Let me get this straight. 
Suppose you had the fever. I 
couldn't catch it from you?" The 
drop could not be medical men; 
there weren't that many. 

"Not easily. From a smear or 
a trace transfusion from my veins 
to yours." 

"Direct contact, eh?" How 
many people could one paratrooper service? Twenty? Thirty? 
More? "If that is what it takes, 
you don't have any problem." 

"I'm sorry. I don't — " 

"What's the first thing a slug 
does when he runs across another

"Conjugation!* '

called it, but I use the sloppy old 
slug language for it. Do you think 
that would pass on the disease?" 

"Think so? I'm sure of it! We 
have demonstrated, right in this 
laboratory, that there is exchange 
of living protein during conjugation. They could not possibly escape transmission; we can infect 
the whole colony as if it were one 
body. Now why didn't J think of 
that?" 

"Don't go off half-cocked," I 
warned. "But I suspect it will 
work." 

"It wilH It will!" He started to 
go, then stopped. "Oh, Mr. Nivens, would you mind very much 
—I know it's a lot to ask — " 

"What is? Speak up." I was 
anxious to work out the Test of 
the other problem, 

"Well, would you permit me 
to announce this method of vectoring? I'll give you full credit, 
but the general expects a lot and 
this is just what I need to make 
my report complete." He looked 
so anxious that I almost laughed. 

"Go ahead," I said. "It's your 
department." 

"That's decent of you. I'll try 
to return the favor." He went 
away happy and so was I ; I was 
beginning to like being a "genius." 

I stopped to straighten out in 
my mind the main features of the 
big drop. Then I went in. Mary 
opened her eyes and gave me 
that long heavenly smile. 



I reached down and smoothed 
her hair. "Howdy, flame top. Did 
you know that your husband is 
a genius?" 

"Of courst." 

"You did? You never said so." 
"You never asked me." 

TTAZELHURST referred to it 
as the "Nivens Vector." Then 
I was asked to comment, though 
Dad looked my way first. 

"I agree with Dr. Hazelhurst," 
I started out, "subject to experimental confirmation. However, he 
has left for discussion aspects 
which are tactical rather than 
medical. Important considerations of timing — crucial, I should 
say — " I had worked out my 
opening speech, even to the hesitations, while eating breakfast — 
"require vectoring from many focal points. If we are to save a 
nominal hundred per cent of the 
population of Zone Red, it is 
necessary that all parasites be 
infected at nearly the same time 
in order that rescue squads may 
enter after the slugs are no longer 
dangerous and before any host 
has passed the point where antitoxin can save him. 

"The problem is susceptil le, to 
mathematical analysis — " Sam, 
boy, I said to myself, you old 
phony, you could not solve it 
with an electronic integrator and 
twenty years of sweat — "and 
should be turned over to your

analytical section. However, let 
me sketch out the factors. Call 
the number of vector origins X; 
call the number of rescue workers 
Y. There will be an indefinitely 
large number of simultaneous 
solutions, with optimum solution 
depending on logistic factors. 

"Speaking in advance of rigorous mathematical treatment — " I 
had done my damnedest with a 
slipstick, but I did not mention 
that — "and basing my opinions 
on my own unfortunately toointimate knowledge of their habits. I would estimate — " 

You could have heard a pin 
drop, if anybody in that bareskinned crew had had a pin. The 
general interrupted once when I 
placed a low estimate on X, "Mr. 
Nivens, I think we can assure 
you of any number of volunteers 
for vectoring." 

1 shook my head. 
"You can't accept volunteers, 
General.** 

"I think I see your objection. 
The disease would have to be 
given time to establish in the 
volunteer and the timing might 
be dangerously close. But I think 
we could get around that — a gelatine capsule of antitoxin embedded in tissue, or something of the 
sort. I'm sure the staff could 
work it out." 

I thought they could, too, but 
my real objection was a deeprooted aversion to any human 



soul having to be possessed by 
a slug. "You must nor use human 
volunteers, General. The slug will 
know everything that his host 
knows and he simply will not go 
into direct conference; he'll warn 
the others by word of mouth instead. No, sir, we will use animals 
— apes, dogs, anything large 
enough to carry a slug, but incapable of speech, and in quantities large enough to infect the 
whole group before any slug 
knows that it is sick." 

I gave a fast sketch of the Anal 
drop, "Schedule Mercy/* as I 
saw it. "The first drop — 'Schedule Fever* — can start as soon as 
we have enough antitoxin for the 
second drop. Less than a week 
after, there should be no slug left 
alive on this continent." 

They did not applaud, but it 
felt that way. The General hurried away to call Air Marshall 
Rexton. then sent his aide back 
to invite me to lunch. I sent word 
that I would be pleased provided 
the invitation included my wife. 

Dad waited for me outside the 
conference room. "Well, how did 
I do?" I asked him, more anxiously than I tried to sound. 

He shook his head. "Sam, you 
wowed 'em. I think 1*11 sign 
you up for twenty-six weeks of 
stereo." 

I tried not to show how much 
I was pleased. I had gotten 
through the whole performance

without once stammering; I felt 
like a genius.

rpHAT ape Satan which had 
-"- wrung my heart at the National Zoo turned out to be as 
mean as he was billed, once he 
was free of his slug. Dad had 
volunteered to be the test case 
for the Nivens-Hazelhurst theories, but I put my foot down 
and Satan drew the short straw. 
It was neither filial affection nor 
its neo-Freudian antithesis that 
caused me to balk him; I did not 
want him on their side even under 



laboratory conditions. Not with 1 
his shifty, tricky mind! People 
who have never experienced possession cannot appreciate that the 
host is utterly against us — with 
all his abilities intact. 

So we used apes for the experiments. We had on hand not 
only apes from the National 
Zoological Gardens, but simian 
citizens from half a dozen zooa 
and circuses. 

Satan was injected with nineday fever on Wednesday, the 
12th. By Friday the fever had 
established. Another chimp-cumslug was put in with him. The 
slugs immediately went into di



THB FUPPST MASTERS 



i 43! 



rcct conference, after which the 
second ape was removed. 

On Sunday, the 16th, Satan's 
master shriveled up and fell off. 
Satan was immediately injected 
with antitoxin. Late Monday the 
other slug died and its host was 
dosed. 

By Wednesday, the 19th, Satan 
was well, though a bit thin, and 
the second ape. Lord Fauntleroy, 
was recovering. I gave Satan a 
banana to celebrate with and he 
took off the first joint of my left 
index finger and me with no time 
for a repair job. 

But a minor injury could not 
depress me. After I had it dressed, 
I looked for Mary, failed to find 
her and ended up in the messroom, wanting someone with 
whom to share a toast. 

The place was empty. Everyone in the labs was working, 
mounting "Schedule Mercy." By 
order of the President, all possible 
preparations were confined to this 
one lab in the Smoky Mountains. 
The apes for vectoring, some two 
hundred of them, were here. The 
culture and antitoxin were being 
"cooked" here. The horses for 
serum were stalled in an underground handball court. 

The million - plus men for 
"Schedule Mercy" could not be 
here, but they would know nothing until alerted just before the 
drop, at which time each would 
be issued a hand gun and ban


doliers of individual antitoxin 
injectors. Those who were unwilling would be pushed, if necessary, 
by some sergeant with a large 
foot. Everything was being done 
to keep the secret close. The only 
way I could see that we could 
lose would be for the titans to 
find out our plans, through a 
renegade or some fool telling his 
wife. 
If we failed to keep this secret, 
our ape vectors would be shot on 
sight wherever they appeared in 
the titan nation. Nevertheless I 
relaxed over my drink, happy 
and reasonably sure that the secret would not leak. Traffic was 
"incoming only" until after Drop 
Day and Colonel Kelly censored 
or monitored all communication 
outward. 

As for a leak outside, the 
chances were slight. The General, 
Dad, Colonel Gibsy, and myself 
had gone to the White House the 
week before. There Dad put on 
an exhibition of belligerence and 
exasperation that got us what 
we wanted; in the end, even Secretary Martinez was kept in the 
dark. If the President and Rexton 
could keep from talking in their 
sleep for another week, I did not 
see how we could miss. 

A week would be none too 
soon : Zone Red was spreading. 
After the battle of Pass Christian, 
the slugs had pushed on and now 
held the Gulf Coast past Pensa

cola. There were signs of more 
to come. Perhaps the slugs were 
growing tired of our resistance 
and might decide to waste raw 
material by A-bombing the cities 
we still held. If so — well, a radar 
screen can alert your defenses, 
but it won't stop a determined 
attack. 

I refused to worry. One more 
week — 

i^OLONEL Kelly came in and 
^-*sat down beside me. "How 
about a drink?" I suggested. "I 
feel like celebrating." 

He examined the paunch bulging in front of him and said. "I 
suppose one more beer wouldn't 
put me in any worse shape." 

"Have two beers. Have a 
dozen." I dialed for him, and told 
him about the success of the experiments with the apes. 

He nodded. "Yes, I had heard. 
Sounds good." 

"Good, the man says! Colonel, 
we are on the one-yard line and 
goal to go. A week from now 
we'll have won." 

"Well?" 

"Then you'll be able to put 
your clothes back on and lead 
a normal life," I answered, irritated. "Or don't you think our 
plans will work?" 

"Yes, I think they will." 
. "Then why the crepe-hanging?" 

He said, "Mr. Nivens, you don't 



think that a man with my pot 
belly enjoys running around 
without his clothes, do you?" 

"I suppose not. As for myself 
1 may hate to give it up — saves 
time and it's a hell of a lot more 
comfortable." 

"Don't worry about it. This is 
a permanent change." 

"Huh? I don't get you. You 
said our plans would work and 
now you talk as if Schedule Suntan would go on forever." 

"In a modified way, it definitely 
will." 

I said, "Pardon me, I'm stupid 
today." 

He dialed for another beer. 
"Mr. Nivens, I never expected 
to see a military reservation 
turned into a ruddy nudist camp. 
Having seen it, I never expect 
to see us change back, because 
we can't. Pandora's box has a 
one-way lid. All the king's horses 
and all the king's men — " 

"Conceded," I said. "Things 
never go back quite to what they 
were before. But you are exaggerating. The day the President 
rescinds Schedule Suntan, the 
blue laws will go back into effect 
and a man without pants will be 
liable to arrest." 

"I hope not." 

"What? Make up your mind." 

" It's made up for me . Mr. 
Nivens, as long as there exists 
a possibility that a slug is alive, 
the polite man must be willing

to bare his body on request, or 
risk getting shot. Not just this 
week and next, but twenty years 
from now, or a hundred. No, no!" 
he added, "I am not disparaging 
your plans, but you have been 
too busy to notice that they are 
strictly local and temporary. For 
example, have you made any provision for combing the Amazonian jungles, tree by tree? This 
globe has nearly sixty million 
square miles of land; we can't 
begin to search it for slugs. Hell, 
we haven't even made a dent in 
rats and we've been at that a 
long time." 

■ "Are you trying to tell me it's 
hopeless?" I demanded. 

"Not at all. Have another 
drink. I'm trying to say that we 
are going to have to learn to live 
with this horror, the way we 
had to learn to live with the 
atom bomb." 

XXXIII 

"Vf 7"E were gathered in the same 
room in the White House; 
it put me in mind of the night 
after the President's message, 
many weeks before. Dad and 
Mary, Rexton and Martinez were 
there, as well as our own lab 
general, Dr. Hazelhurst, and 
Colonel Gibsy. Our eyes were on 
the big map still mounted across 
one Wall. It had been four and 
a half days since the drop of 



"Schedule Fever," but the Mississippi Valley still glowed with 
ruby lights. 

I was getting j ittery , even 
though the drop had been an 
apparent success and we had lost 
only three craft. According to the 
equations, every slug within 
reach of direct conference should 
have been infected three days 
ago, with an estimated twentythree per cent overlap. The 
operation had been computed to 
contact about eighty per cent in 
the first twelve houTs, mostly in 
cities. 

Soon, slugs should start dying 
a damn sight faster than flies 
ever did — it we were right. 

I tried to sit still while I wondered whether those ruby lights 
covered a few million very sick 
slugs, or merely two hundred 
dead apes. Had somebody skipped a decimal point? Or blabbed? 
Or had there been an error in 
our reasoning so colossal that 
we could not see it? 

Suddenly a light blinked green; 
everybody sat up. A voice began 
to come out of the stereo gear, 
though no picture built up. "This 
is Station Dixie, Little Rock T " 
a very tired Southern voice said. 
"We need help very badly. Anyone who is listening, please pass 
on this message : Little Rock, 
Arkansas, is in the grip of a 
terrible epidemic. Notify the Red 
Cross. We have been in the hands 



150 




 



of — " The voice trailed off, either 
from weakness or transmission 
failure. 

I remembered to breathe. Marypatted my hand and I sat back, 
relaxing consciously. It was joy 
too great to be pleasure. I saw 
now that the green light had not 
been Little Rock, but farther west 
in Oklahoma. Two more lights 
blinked green, one in Nebraska 
and one north of the Canadian 
line. Another voice came over, 
a twangy New England one. I 
wondered how he had gotten into 
Zone Red. 

"A little like election night, eh. 
Chief?" Martinez said heartily. 

"A little," the President agreed, 
"but we do not usually get returns from Old Mexico." He 
pointed to the board; green lights 
were showing in Chihuahua. 

"By George, you're right. Welt, 
I guess State will have some incidents to straighten out when 
this is over, eh?" 

The President did not answer 
and he shut up, to my relief. The 
President seemed to be talking 
to himself. He noticed me, smiled 
and spoke out loud: 

" *Tis said that fleas have little 
fleas, 

Upon their backs to bite 'em, 
And little fleas have lesser 
fleas. 

And so, ad infinitum.' " 
I smiled to be polite, though I 
thought the notion waa gruesome, 



under the circumstances. The 
President looked away and said, 
"Would anyone like supper? I 
find that I am hungry for the 
first time in days." 

T>Y late next afternoon, the 
board was more green than 
red. Rexton had had two annunciators keyed into the command 
center in the New Pentagon. One 
showed percentage of completion 
of the complicated score deemed 
necessary before the big drop; the 
other showed projected time of 
drop. The figures on it changed 
from time to time. For the past 
two hours they had been hovering 
around 17.43 East Coast time. 

Rexton got up. "I'm going to 
freeze it at seventeen -forty -five,'* 
he announced. "Mr. President, 
will you excuse me?" 

"Certainly, Marshal." 

Rexton turned to Dad and myself. "If you Don Quixotes want 
to drop in on Zone Red, now is 
the time/' 

I stood up. "Mary, you wait 
for me." 

She asked, "Where?" It had 
been settled — and not peacefully! 
— that she was not to go along. 

The President interrupted. "I 
suggest that Mrs. Nivens stay 
here. After all, she is a member 
of the family." 

I said, "Thank you, sir." 
Colonel Gibsy got a very odd 
look.

Two hours later we were coming in on our target and the jump 
door was open. Dad and I were 
la-st in line, after the kids who 
would do the real work. My 
hands were sweaty with the old 
curtain-going-up tension. I was 
scared as hell — I never did like 
to jump. . 

XXXIV 

^^UN in my left hand, antitoxin 
hypo ready in my right, I 
went from door to door in my 
assigned block. It was an older 
section of Jefferson City, slums 
almost, consisting of apartment 
houses built fifty years ago. I 
had given two dozen injections 
and had three dozen to go before 
it would be time for me to rendezvous at the State House. I was 
getting sick of it. 

I knew why I had come — it 
was not just curiosity; 1 had to 
see the slugs die! But now I had 
seen them dead and I had had 
enough of it. 

I wanted to go home, take a 
bath, and forget it. 

It was not hard work, just 
monotonous and nauseating. So 
far I had not seen one live slug, 
though I had seen many dead 
ones. I had burned down one 
skulking dog that appeared to 
have a hump; I was not sure because the light had been bad. 
We had hit shortly before sun


down and now it was almost dark. 

I finished checking the apartment building I was in and went 
out into the street. It was almost 
deserted; with the whole population sick with the fever, we found 
few on the streets. The lone exception was a man who came 
weaving toward me, eyes vacant. 
I yelled, "Hey!" 

He stopped. I said, "I've got 
what you need to get well. Hold 
out your arm." 

He struck at me feebly. I hit 
him carefully and he went face 
down. Across his back was the 
red rash of the slug. I picked a 
reasonably clean and healthy 
patch over his kidney and stuck 
in the injector, bending it to break 
the point after it was in. The 
units were gas-loaded; nothing 
more was needed. 

The first floor of the next house 
held seven people, most of them 
so far gone that I did not speak 
but simply gave them their shots 
and hurried on. I had no trouble. 
The second floor was like the first. 

The top floor had three empty 
apartments, at one of which I had 
to burn out the lock to enter. 
The fourth flat was occupied, in 
a manner of speaking. There was 
a dead woman on the floor of the 
kitchen, her head bashed in. Her 
slug was still on her shoulders, 
but it was dead, too. I left them 
quickly and looked around. 
In the bathroom, sitting in an 



152 




 



old-fashioned tub, was a middleaged man. His head slumped on 
his chest and his wrist veins were 
open. I thought he was dead, but 
he looked up as I bent over him. 
"You're too late," he said dully. 
"I killed my wife." 

—or too soon, I thought. From 
the appearance of the bottom of 
the tub and his gray face, five 
minutes later would have been 
better. I looked at him, wondering whether or not to waste an 
injection. 

He spoke again. "My little 
girl—" 

His head slumped forward 
again. I felt his jaw line and dug 
my thumb into his neck, but 
could find no pulse. 

The child was in bed in one 
of the rooms, a girl of eight or 
so who would have been pretty 
had she been well. She roused 
and cried somewhat deliriously 
and called me Daddy. "Yes, yes," 
I said soothingly, "Daddy's going 
to take care of you." I gave her 
the injection in her leg; I don't 
think she noticed it. 

I turned to go, but she called 
out again. "I'm thirsty. Want a 
drink of water." So I had to go 
back into that' bathroom again. 

As I was giving it to her, my 
phone shrilled and I spilled some 
of the water. "Son! Can you hear 
me?" 

I reached for my belt and 



switched on my phone. "Yes. 
What's up?" 

"I'm in that little park just 
north of you. I'm in trouble." 

"Coming!" I put down the 
glass and started to leave — then, 
caught by indecision, I turned 
back. I could not leave the child 
to wake up with a parent dead 
in each room. I gathered her up 
and stumbled down to the second floor. I entered the first door 
I came to and laid her on a sofa. 
There were people in the flat, too 
sick to bother with her, but it 
was alt I could do. 

*'Hurry, son!" 

"On my way!" I dashed out 
and wasted no more breath talking, but made speed. Dad's assignment was directly north of 
mine, paralleling it and fronting 
on one of those pint-sized downtown parks. 

"Here, son, over here — at the 
car!" I could hear him both 
through the phone and by ear. I 
swung around and spotted the 
car, a big Cadillac duo much 
like those the Section often used. 
There was someone inside, but 
it was too dark for me to see. I 
approached cautiously until I 
heard him say, "Thank God! I 
thought you woiild never come," 
and knew that it was he. 

I had to duck to get in through 
the door. It was then that he 
clipped me. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



153 



W CAME to, to find my hands 

and ankles tied. I was in the 
second driver's seat of the car 
and the Old Man was in the 
other at the controls. The wheel 
on my side was latched up out 
of the way. The realization that 
the car was in the air brought 
me fully awake. 

He turned and said cheerfully, 
"Feeling better?" I could see his 
slug, riding high on his shoulders. 

"Some," I admitted. 

"Sorry 1 had to hit you," he 
went on, "but there was no other 
way." 

*'I supose not." 

"I'll have to leave you tied up 
for the present. Later on we can 
make better arrangements." He 
grinned, his old wicked grin. Most 
amazingly, his own personality 
Came through with every word 
the slug said. 

I did not ask what "better arrangements" were possible; I did 
not want to know. I concentrated 
on checking my bonds — but the 
Old Man had given them his 
personal attention. 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

"South." He fiddled with the 
controls. "Way south. Give me a 
moment to lay this heap in the 
groove and I will explain what's 
'in rtore for us." He was busy for 
a few seconds, then said, "There, 
that will hold her until she levels 
off at thirty thousand." 

The mention of that much alti


tude caused me to look at the 
control board. The duo did not 
merely look like one of the Section's cars; it actually was one 
of our souped-up jobs. 

"Where did you get this car?" 
I asked. 

"The Section had it cached in 
Jefferson City. I looked and, sure 
enough, nobody had found it. 
Fortunate, wasn't it?" 

There could be a second opinion, I thought, but I did not argue. I was still checking the 
possibilities and finding them between slim and hopeless. My own 
gun was gone. He was probably 
carrying his on the side away 
from me; it was not in sight. 

"But that was not the best of 
it," he went on. "I had the good 
luck to be captured by what was 
almost certainly the only healthy 
master in the whole of Jefferson 
City — not that I believe in luck. 
So we win, after all." He chuckled. "It's like playing both sides 
of a very difficult chess game." 

"You didn't tell me where we 
are going," I persisted. I was getting nowhere fast and talking was 
the only action open to me. 

He considered. "Out of the 
United States, certainly. My master may be the only one free of 
nine-day fever in the whole continent and I don't dare take a 
chance. I think the Yucatan 
Peninsula would suit us. That's 
where I've got her pointed. We 



t54 




 



can hole up there and increase 
our numbers and work farther 
south. When we do come back — 
and we will!- — we won't make the 
same mistakes." 

I said, "Dad, can't you take 
these ropes off me? They cut my 
circulation. You know you can 
trust me." 

"Wait until we go full automatic." The car was still climbing. Souped up or not, thirty 
thousand was a long pull for a 
car that had started out as a 
family model. 

I sa id , " You see m to forget 
that I was with the masters a long 
time. I know the score and I give 
you my word of honor." 

He grinned. "Don't teach 
grandma how to steal sheep. If 
I let you loose now, you'll kill 
me or I'll have to kill you. And 
I want you alive. We're going 
places, son — you and me. We're 
fast and we're smart and we are 
just what the doctor ordered." 

I did not have an answer. He 
went on, "Just the same — about 
you knowing the score, why 
didn't you tell me, son? Why did 
you hold out on me?" 

"How?" 

"I had no idea that a man 
could feel such peace and contentment and well-being. This is 
the happiest I've been in years, 
the happiest since — " He looked 
puzzled — "since your mother 
died. But never mind that; this 



is better. You should have tolc 
me." 

Disgust suddenly poured over 
me. I forgot the cautious game I 
was playing. "Maybe I didn't see 
it that way. And neither would 
you, you old fool, if you didn't 
have a slug riding you. talking 
through your mouth, thinking 
with your brain!" 

"Take it easy, son," he said 
gently — and so help me. his voice 
did quiet me. "You'll know better soon. Believe me, this is what 
we were intended for. This is our 
destiny. Mankind has been divided, warring with himself. The 
masters will make him whole." 

I thought to myself that that 
was exactly what the slugs 
wanted humanity to do — surrender their souls willingly for a 
phony promise of security and 
peace. But I did not say so. 

"You need not wait much 
longer," he said suddenly, glancing at the board. "I'll nail her 
down in the groove." He adjusted 
his dead-reckoner bug, checked 
his board, and set his controls. 
"Next stop: Yucatan. Now to 
work." He got out of the chair 
and knelt beside me in the 
crowded space. "Got to be safe/' 
he added, as he strapped the 
safety belt across my middle. 

I brought my knees up in his 
face. 

He reared up and looked at 
me without anger. "Naughty, 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



155 



naughty. I could resent that, but 
the masters don't go in for resentment. Now be good."- He went 
ahead, checking my wrists and 
feet. His nose was bleeding, but 
he did not bother to wipe it. 
"You'll do," he said. "Be patient; 
it won't be long." 

He went back to the other control seat, sat down and leaned 
forward, elbows on knees. It 
brought his master directly into 
my view. 

Nothing happened for some 
minutes, nor could I think of anything to do but strain at my 
bonds. By his appearance, the 
Old Man was asleep, only he 
wasn't. I knew what was about 
to happen. 

A line formed straight down 
the middle of the horny brown 
covering of the slug. 

As I watched it, it widened. 
Presently I could see the opalescent horror underneath. The 
space between the two halves of 
the shell widened — the slug was 
fissioning, sucking life and nourishment out of the body of my 
father to make two of itself. 

I had no more than five minutes of independent life left to me. 

TTAD it been possible for flesh 
and bone to break the ties 
on me, I would have broken them. 
I did not succeed. The Old Man 
paid no attention to my struggles. 
I doubt if he was conscious; the 



slugs must simply immobilize the 
slave while occupied with splitting. 

By the time I had given up, 
worn out and sure that I could 
not break loose, I could see the 
silvery line down the center of 
the slug proper which means that 
fission is about to be complete. 
That was what changed my line 
of reasoning, if there were reason 
left in my churning skull. 

My hands were tied behind me, 
my ankles were tied, and I was 
belted tight across the middle to 
the chair. But my legs, even 
though fastened together, were 
free from my waist down. I 
slumped down to get even more 
reach and swung my legs up 
hi gh. I brought them down 
smashingly across the board — 
and set off every launching unit 
in her racks. 

The Old Man and I were both 
slammed back against the seats, 
he much harder than I, since I 
was strapped down. He was 
thrown so hard that his slug, 
open and helpless, was crushed. 

It splashed. 

Dad was caught in that terrible, 
total reflex, that spasm of every 
muscle that I had seen three 
times before. He bounced forward against the wheel, face contorted, fingers writhing. 

The car dived. 

I sat there and watched it dive, 
if you call it sitting when you

are held in place only by the belt. 
Dad's body had hopelessly fouled 
the controls; otherwise I might 
have been able to do something 
— gotten her headed up again, 
perhaps — with my bound feet. I 
tried, but with no success at all. 
The controls were probably jammed as well as fouled.' 

The altimeter was clicking 
away busily. We had dropped to 
eleven thousand feet before I 
found time to glance at it. Then 
it was nine . . . seven . . . six . . . 
and we entered our last mile. 

At fifteen hundred, the radar 
interlock cut in and the nose 
units fired one at a time. The 
belt buffeted me across the stomach each time. I was thinking that 
I was saved, that now the ship 
would level off — 

And I was still thinking so 
when we crashed. 

1CAME to by becoming slowly 
aware of a gently rocking motion. I was annoyed by it. I 
wanted it to stop; even a slight 
motion seemed to cause more 
pain than I could bear. I managed to get one eye open — the 
other would not open at all — and 
looked dully around for the 
source of my annoyance. 

Above me was the floor of the 
car, but I stared at it for a long 
time before I could identify it. 
By then I was somewhat aware 
of where I was and what had 



happened. I remembered the dive 
and the crash, and realized that 
we must have crashed not into 
the ground, but into some body 
of water. The Gulf of Mexico? 
I did not really care. 

My broken seat belt was flapping above me. My hands were 
still tied and so were my ankles, 
and one arm seemed to be broken. 
An eye was stuck shut and it hurt 
me to breathe. 

I quit taking stock of my injuries. 

Dad was no longer plastered 
against the wheel and that puzzled me. With painful effort. I 
rolled my head over to see the 
rest of the car with my one good 
eye. He was lying not far from 
me, three feet or so from my 
head to his. He was bloody and 
cold and I was sure that he was 
dead. I think it took me about a 
half hour to cross that short distance. 

I lay face to face with him, almost cheek to cheek. So far as 
I could tell, there was no trace 
of life, nor, from the odd and 
twisted way in which he lay. did 
it seem possible. 

"Dad," I said hoarsely. Then 
I screamed it. "Dad!" 

His eyes flickered but did not 
open. "Hello, son," he whispered. 
"Thanks, boy, thanks — " His 
voice died out. 

I wanted to shake him, but 
all I could do was shout. "Dad! 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



157 



Wake up — are you all right?" 

He spoke again, every word a 
painful task. "Your mother — said 
to tell you — she was — proud of 
you." His voice died out again 
and his breathing was labored in 
that ominous dry-stick sound. 

"Dad," I sobbed, "don't die. I 
can't get along without you." 

His eyes opened. "Yes, you can, 
son." He paused, then added, "I'm 
hurt, boy." His eyes closed again. 

I could not get any more out of 
him, though I shouted and 
screamed. Presently I put my face 
against his and let rny tears mix 
with the dirt and blood. 

Then I passed out again, and 
awoke in a hospital bed. Mary 
was kissing my face, bandages 
and all. 

"Dad!" I said, feeling that awful grief again. "He's dead, isn't 
he?" 

A wicked muffled voice answered. "Not a chance, son. I'm 
just as tough as you are." He 
grinned weakly at me through the 
window of an oxygen tent. . 

I grinned and fell asleep, holding Mary's hand. 

WE who are going to clean up 
Titan are all writing these 
reports. If we do not come back, 
' this is our legacy to free human 
beings — all that we know of how 
the titan parasites operate and 
what must be guarded against. 
For Kelly was right; there is no 



getting Humpty-Dumpty together 
again. In spite of the success of 
Schedule Mercy, there is no way 
to be sure that the slugs are all 
gone. Only last week a Kodiak 
bear was shot, up Yukon way, 
wearing a hump. 

The human race will have to 
be always on guard, especially 
about twenty -five years from 




T!5E 




 



now, if we don't come back — and 
the Flying Saucers do. We don't 
know why the titan monsters follow the twenty -nine -year cycle of 
Saturn's year, but they do. The 
reason may be simple; we ourselves have many cycles which 
match the Earth year. We hope 
that they are active only at one 
period of their year; if they are. 



Operation Vengeance may have 
easy pickings. Not that we are 
counting on it. 

I am going out. heaven help 
us, as an "applied psychologist 
(exotic)," but I am also a combat 
trooper, as is every one of us, 
from chaplain to cook. This is 
for keeps and we intend to show 
those slugs that they made the 




imstnkc of tangling with the 
toughest, meanest, deadliest, most 
unrelenting — and ablest — form of 
life 'n this section of space, a 
critter that can be killed but can't 
be turned. 

fl have a private hope that we 
will find some way to save the 
little elf creatures, the androgynes. I think we could get along 
with them.) 

Whether we make it or not, the 
human race has got to keep up its 
well-earned reputation for ferocity. The price of freedom is the 
willingness to do sudden battle, 
anywhere, anytime, and with utter selflessness. If we did not learn 
that from the slugs, well — "Dinosaurs, move over! We are ready 
to become extinct!" 

For who knows what dirty 
tricks may be lurking around this 
Universe? The slugs may be 
simple and open and friendly 
compared with, let us say, the 
natives of the planets of Sirius. 
If this is just the opener, we had 
better learn from it for the main 
event. We thought space was 
empty and that we were automatically the lords of creation. 
Even after we '"conquered" space, 
we thought so, for Mars was already dead and Venus had not 
really gotten started. Well, if Man 
wants to be top dog — or even a 
respftted neighbor — he'll have to 
fight for it. 

Eftry one of us who is going 



has been possessed at least once. 
Only those who have been hagridden can know how tricky the 
slugs are, how constantly one 
must be on guard— or how deeply 
one must hate. The trip, they 
tell me, will take about twelve 
years, which will give Mary and 
me time to finish our honeymoon. 
Oh, yes, Mary is going; most of 
us are married couples and the 
single men are balanced by single 
women. Twelve years isn't a trip; 
it's a way of living. 

When I told Mary that we were 
going to Saturn's moons, her 
single comment was, "Yes, dear." 

We'll have time to have two 
or three kids. As Dad says, "The 
race must go on, even if it doesn't 
know where." 

I am now finishing this report 
in Space Station Beta, from 
which we will transship to U. N. 
S. Avenger. We said good-bye to 
Dad last night at Pikes Peak 
Port. He corrected me. "So long, 
you mean. You'll be back and I 
intend to hang on, getting crankier every year, until you do.*' 

I said I hoped so. He nodded. 
"You'll make it and so will I. 
We're both too tough and mean 
to die. I've got a lot of confidence 
in you and the likes of you, son." 

We are about to transship. I 
feel exhilarated. Puppet masters 
— the free men are coming to kill 
you I
