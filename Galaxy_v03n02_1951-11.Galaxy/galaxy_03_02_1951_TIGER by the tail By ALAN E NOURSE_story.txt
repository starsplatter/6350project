The salesgirl at the ccufrter was 
busy i.t the far end, nnd the 
womnn was equally busy Bt her 



own end, slipping goods from the 
counter into the large black purse. 
Kearney watched for several minutes in growing alarm before he 
motioned over the other section 
manager. 

"Watch th«t woman for a min

ute," he said in an offhand whisper. "She's sorting that hardware 
like she owns the store!" 

"A klepto? What are you waiting for?" asked the other. "Let's 
have a talk with her — " 

Kearney scratched his head. 
"Watch her for a moment. 
There's something damned 
fishy — " 

They watched. She was standing at the- kitchenware counter, 
her hands running over the merchandise on the shelf. She took 
three cookie cutters, and popped 
them into the pocketbook. Two 
large cake tins and a potato 
masher followed- Then a small 
cake-safe, and two small pots. 
Then a large aluminum skillet. 

The second man stared in disbelief. "She's taken enough junk 
there to stock a store. And she's 
putting it all into that pocketbook. Kearney, she couldn't get 
all that junk into a pocketbook!" 

4, I know," said Kearney. "Let's 
go." 

They moved in on her from opposite sides, and Kearney took 
her gently by the arm. "We'd like 
to speak to you, madam. Please 
come with us quietly." 

She looked up blankly, then 
shrugged and followed them into 
a small office. "I don't know what 
this means — ** 

"We've been watching you for 
fifteen minutes." Kearney took 
the pocketbook from her arm, 



unsnapped it, glanced inside, p" 
shook it in alarm. 

He looked up, eyes wide a 
puzzled. "Jerry, look at thi

The pocketbook was empty.

picked it up. It felt like a pocketbook. "What's in it?" 

"You tell us," Evanson said. 

Collins opened it up. It was 
curiously dark inside, with a dull 
metallic ring around the inside, 
near the top. He turned it upside 
down, and shook it. Nothing came 
out. 

"Don't reach around inside," 
Evanson cautioned. "It's not safe. 
One fellow tried, and lost a wristwatch." 

Collins looked up, his bland 
full face curious. "Where did you 
get this?" 

"A couple of section managers 
spotted a shoplifter down in the 
Taylor-Hyden store a couple of 
days ago. She was helping herself 
to kitchen hardware, and was 
Stuffing anything and everything 
into the pocketbook. They nabbed her, but when they tried to 
get the hardware back out of the 
pocketbook, they couldn't find 
any. One of them lost a wristwatch groping around in it." 

"Yes, but how did you wind up 
with the purse?" 

Evanson shrugged. "Ever since 
■the end of the war in '71, when 
they organized Psych, they've 
turned shoplifters over to them. 
This woman was taken to Psych, 
but when they jarred her into remembering who she was, she 
couldn't recall having the purse. 
After Psych had looked at the 
pocketbook, they naturally sent it

over to us. Here, I'll show you 
why." 

Evanson picked up a meter 
Btick, and began to push it into 
the pocketbook. It went in about 
ten centimeters,, to the bottom of 
the purse — 

And kept on going. 

It didn't poke out the bottom. 
It didn't even bulge the purse. 

Collins goggled at it. "Holy 
smoke, how'd you do that?" 

"Maybe it's going somewhere 
else. Fourth dimension. I don't 
know." 

"Nuts!" 

"Where else, then?" Evanson. 
laid the meter stick down. "Another thing about that pocketbook," he added. "No matter 
what you do, you can't turn it 
inside out." 

Collins looked at the dark inside of the pocketbook. Gingerly 
he stuck his finger in, rubbed the 
metallic ring, scratched it with his 
nail. A shiny line appeared. 
"That's aluminum in there," he 
said. "An aluminum circle." 

Evanson took it and looked. 
"All the stuff she was stealing 
was aluminum." he said. "That's 
one reason we called you. You 
know your mechanics, and you 
know your metals. We've been 
trying for three days to figure out 
what happens here. We can't. 
Maybe you can." 

"What have you been doing?** 

"Pushing st uff in. Che eking 



it with all the instruments, X-ray, 
everything. Didn't tell us a thing. 
We'd like to know where that 
stuff goes that we push in." 

Collins dropped an aluminum 
button into the purse. It went 
through the aluminum circle and 
vanished. "Say," he asked suddenly, scowling, "what do you 
mean, you can't turn this thing 
inside out?" 

"It's a second-order geometric 
form." Evanson lit a cigarette 
carefully. "You can turn a firstorder form, like a sphere or rubber ball, inside out through a 
small hole in the surface. But you 
can't turn an inner-tube inside 
out. no matter what you do." 

"Why not?" 

"Because it's got a hole in it. 
And you can't pull a hole through 
a hole. Not even an infinitesimal 
hole." 

"Well?" said Collins, frowning. 

"It's the same thing with that 
purse. We think it's wrapped 
around a chunk of another 
verse. A four-dirhensional universe. And you can't pull a chunk 
of another universe through this 
one, without causing a lot of 
trouble." 

"But you can turn an innertube insi de out," Coll ins protested. "It may not look like an 
inner-tube any more, but it will 
all come through the hole." 

Evanson eyed the pocketbook 
on the table. "Maybe so. A sec

©nd -order geometric under condition of stress. But there's one 
hitch to that. It won't be an inner-tube any more." 

"CWANSON pushed the fourth 
item made of aluminum into 
the purse. He shook his head 
tiredly. "I don't knojv. Something 
is taking that aluminum — " He 
pushed in a wooden ruler; it 
popped right out again. "And it 
wants only aluminum. Nothing 
else. That detective had an aluminum military watch, which disappeared from his wrist, but he 
had two gold rings on that hand, 
and neither one was touched." 

"Let's play some thinking 
games," Collins said. 

Evanson looked up sharply. 
"What do you mean?" 

Collins grinned. "Whatever is 
on the other side of that pocketbook seems to want aluminum. 
Why? There's an aluminum ring 
around the mouth of the purse — 
ell around it. Like a portal. But 
it isn't very big, and it doesn't 
use much aluminum. They seem 
to want lots more." 

"They?" 

"Whatever takes the metal, but 
pushes back the wood." 
"Why?" 

"We could venture a guess. 
Maybe they're building another 
opening. A large one." 

Evanson stared at him. "Don't 
be silly," he said. "Why — " 



"I was just thinking out loud," 
said Collins mildly. He picked up 
a steel meter stick. Taking a firm 
grip on one end, he pushed the 
other end into the purse. 

Evanson watched, puzzled. 
"They don't want it. They're trying to push it back." 

Collins continued to insert the 
stick, with pressure, and suddenly 
the end appeared, coming back 
out. Like a flash Collins grabbed 
it, and began tugging both ends 
at once. 

"Watch it. watch it!" Evanson 
snapped. "You're making their 
universe conform to our geometry!" The purse seemed to sag 
inward. 

One end of the rod suddenly 
slipped out of Collins hand. He 
ft 11 back, grasping the stick. It 
was straight: 

"Evanson!" he snapped excitedly. "Can you get a winch up 
here?" 

Evanson blinked dully, and 
nodded. 

"Good," said Collins. "I think 
I know how we can hook onto 
their universe." 

THE big three-inch steel bar 
rolled easily into the lab on a 
dolly. The end of the bar, for 
inches, was covered with shiny 
aluminum tubing, and bent into a 
sharp hook. 

"Is the winch ready?" Collins 
asked excitedly.

Evanson told him it was. 

"Then slide the purse onto the 
end of the bar." 

The end of the bar disappeared 
into the pocketbook. 

"What are you trying to do?" 
Evanson asked uneasily. 

"They seem to want aluminum, 
so we're going to give them some. 
If they're building another opening through with it, I want to 
hook onto the opening and pull it 
out into this lab. They'll be putting the aluminum on this bar 
with the rest. If we can hook onto 
that aluminum, they'll either 
have to cut it free and let us retrieve it, or open it into this lab.** 

Evanson scowled. "But what if 
they don't do either?" " 

"They have to. If we pull a 
non-free section of their universe 
through the purse, it will put a 
terrific strain on their whole geometric pattern. Their whole universe will be twisted. Just like an 
inner-tube." 

The winch squeaked as Collins 
worked the bar to and fro ininside the purse. 

"Up a little," he said to the 
operator. 

Evanson shook his head sourly. 
*I don't see — " he began. The bar 
twanged under sudden pressure. 

"Hold it! You've got it 
hooked!" Collins shouted. 

The winch squealed noisily, the 
motor whining under the strain. 
The steel bar slid slowly out of 

TIGER WITH A TAIL 



the purse, millimeter by millimeter, pulled as taut as a piano 
wire. Every ten minutes one of 
the technicians made a chalk 
mark on the bar by the mouth 
of the purse. 

Frank Collins filled a pipe and 
puffed nervously. "The way I see 
it," he said, "these beings pried a 
small fourth-dimension hole into 
our universe, and somehow got 
that woman under a suggestive 
trance. They made her collect 
aluminum so they could build a 
bigger opening." 

"But why?" Evanson poured 
coffee out of a thermos. It was 
late, and the whole building was 
silent and deserted except for this 
one lab section. The only noise 
in the room was the whine of the 
winch, straining at the other universe. 

"Who knows? To get more and 
more aluminum ? Whatever the 
reason, they want to get through 
to our universe. Maybe theirs is 
in some danger or other. Hell, 
the reason may be so alien that 
we couldn't possibly understand 
it." 

"But what's the idea of hooking 
onto them?" Evanson's eyes were 
worried. 

"Control. We pull a non-free 
chunk of their universe into ours, 
and they can't use the opening. 
It'll be plugged up. The more we 
pull through, the more strain on 
the structure of their universe. 

47 




They'll have to listen to our 
terms then. They'll have to give 
us their information so that we 
can build openings, and examine 
them properly. If they don't, we'll 
wreck their universe." 

"But you don't even- know what 
they're doing in there!" 

Collins shrugged, made another 
chalk mark on the bar. The bar 
was humming. 

"I don't think we should take 
the risk," Evanson complained. 
"I didn't have permission to try 
this. I just let you go ahead on 
my own authority, on data—" 
he shuddered suddenly — "that's 
so damned vague, it makes no 
sense at all." 

Collins knocked out his pipe 
sharply. "It's all the data we 
have." 

"I say it's wrong. I think we 
should release the bar right now, 
and wait till Chalmers gets iwftf* 
in the morning." 

Collins eyed the winch with 
growing uneasiness, lighting his 
pipe with a match held in unsteady fingers. "We can't release 
the bar now. The tapered sheaves 
are under too much tension. We 
couldn't even burn through that 
rod with an oxy-torch in less than 
twenty minutes — and it would 
jolt the whole building apart 
when it broke." 

"But the danger — " Evanson 
stood up, his forehead beaded 
with perspiration. He nodded to

ward the creaking winch. "You 
might be gambling our whole 
universe." 

"Oh, calm down!" Collins said 
angrily. "We don't have any 
choice now, or even time to talk 
it over. We're doing it and that's 
all there is to it. When you grab 
a tiger by the tail, you've got to 
hang on." 

Evanson crossed the room excitedly. "It seems to me," he said 
tensely, "that the tiger might 
have the advantage. If it went the 
wrong way, think what they 



could do to our universe!" 

Collins blew smoke from the 
corner of his mouth. "At any rate, 
I'm glad we thought of it first — ** 
He trailed off, his face slowly 
turning white. 

Evanson followed his stare, and 
his breath came in a sharp gasp. 
The thermos clattered noisily to 
the floor. He pointed at the second chalk mark, sliding into the 
pocketbook. 

"You mean you hope we did,** 
he said.
