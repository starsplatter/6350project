The Puppet Masters By ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 


About dawn Mary began to 
struggle and moan. I put a hand 
on her. "There, baby, it'LL be all 
right. Sam's here." 

Her eyes opened and for a moment held the same horror. Then 
she saw me and relaxed. "Sam! 
Oh, darling, I've had the most 
terrible dream." 

"It's all right," I repeated. 

"Why are you wearing gloves?" 
She became aware of her own 
dressings; she looked dismayed 
and said, "It wasn't a dream!" 

"No, dearest, it wasn't a dream. 
But it's all right: I killed it." 

"You're sure?" 

"Quite sure." 

"Come here, Sam. Hold me 
tight." 

I did, while trying to be careful of her burns. Presently her 
trembling stopped. "Forgive me, 
darling — I'm weak and womanish." 

"You should have seen the 
shape I was in after I was possessed." 

"I did see. Now tell me what 
happened. The last I remember, 
you were trying to force me into 
the fireplace." 

"Look, Mary, I couldn't help 
it. I had to. There was no other 
way to get it oft." 

"I know, darling, and thank 
you for doing it! Again I owe you 
everything." 

She then cried and I blew my 
nose and went on, "You didn't 
answer when I called, so I went 
into the living room and there 
you were." 

"I remember. Oh. darling, I 
tried so hard!" 

I stared at her. "I know you 



did. You tried to leave. But how? 
Once a slug gets you, there's no 
way to fight it." 

"Well, I lost— but I tried." 
Somehow. Mary had forced her 
will against that of a parasite 
and that can't be done. I know. 
I had a sneaking hunch that 
had Mary not been able to resist 
the slug to some extent, however 
slight, I would have lost the 
struggle, handicapped as I was by 
fear of killing her, too. 

"I should have used a light, 
Sam," she added, "but it never 
occurred to me to be afraid nere," 
I nodded; this was the safe place, 
like crawling into bed or into 
sheltering arms. "Pirate came at 
once. I didn't see the slug until 
I had touched him. Then it was 
too late." She sat up. "Where is 
he, Sam? Is he all right? Call 
him." 

So I had to tell her about Pirate. She listened without expression, nodded and never referred 
to him again. I changed the subject by saying, "Now that you 
are awake, I had better fix you 
some breakfast." 

"Don't go/" I stopped. "Don't 
go out of my sight at alt," she 
begged, "not for any reason. I'll 
get breakfast." 

"The hell you will. You'll stay 
in bed like a good girl." 

"Come here and take off those 
gloves. I want to see your hands." 
I did not take them off — could

not bear to think about it; the 
anesthesia had worn off. She said 
grimly, "Just as I thought. You 
were burned worse than I was." 

So she got breakfast. Furthermore, she ate. I wanted nothing 
but coffee. I did insist that she 
drink a lot, too; large area burns 
dehydrate the body. Presently she 
pushed aside her plate and said, 
"Darling, I'm not sorry it happened. Now we've both been 
there." I nodded dumbly. Sharing 
happiness is not enough. She 
stood up and told me, "We must 
go." 

"Yes," I agreed. "I want to get 
you to a_ doctor as soon as possible." 

"I didn't mean that." 

"I know you didn't." There was 
no need to discuss it; we both 
knew the music had stopped and 
it was time to go back to work. 
The heap we had arrived in was 
still sitting on my landing flat, 
piling up rental charges. It took 
about three minutes to burn the 
dishes, switch off everything, and 
get ready. 

Mary drove, because of my 
hands. Once in the air she said, 
"Let's go straight to the Section 
offices. We'll get treatment there 
and find out what has been going 
on — or are your hands hurting 
too badly? 7 ' 

"Suits," I said. I wanted to 
learn the situation and I wanted 
to get back to work. I asked Mary 

THE PUPPET MASTERS 



to switch on the squawk screen 
to catch a newscast, But the car's 
communication equipment was as 
junky as the rest of it; we could 
not even pick up audio. Fortunately the remote control circuits 
were okay, or Mary would have 
had to buck traffic on manual. 

A thought had been fretting 
me; I mentioned it to Mary. "A 
slug wouldn't mount a cat just 
for the hell of it, would it?" 

"I suppose not." 

"But why? It has to make 
sense; everything they do makes 
sense, from their viewpoint." 

"But it did make sense. They 
caught a human that way." 

"Yes, I know. But how could 
they plan it? Surely there aren't 
so many of them that they can 
afford to gamble like that. Or 
are there?" I remembered Kansas 
Gity, saturated, and shivered. 
"Where did the slug come from? 
It had to get to the Pirate on the 
back of another host. What host? 
1% say it was Old John — John the 
Goat. Pirate wouldn't let any 
other human get close to him." 

"Old John?" Mary closed her 
eyes, thought hard, then opened 
them. "I can't get any feeling 
about it. I was never close to 
him." 

"By elimination I think it must 
be true. Old John wore a coat 
when everyone else was complying with the bareback order. Ergo; 
he was hag-ridden before Sched
105 



ule Bareback. But why would a 
slug single out a hermit way up 
in the mountains?" 

"To cnpture you." 

"Me?" 

"To recapture you." 
It made some sense. Possibly 
any host that ever escaped them 
was a marked man. In that case, 
the doi:en-odd Congressmen we 
had rescued were in special danger. I'd mark that down to turn 
in for analysis. 

On the other hand, the slugs 
might want me in particular. 
What was special about me? I 
was a secret agent. More important, the slug, that had ridden me 
knew what I knew about the Old 
Man, and was aware that I had 
access to him. I felt emotionally 
certain that the Old Man was 
their principal antagonist; the 
slug must have known that I 
thought so, for he had had full 
use of my mind. 

That slug had even met the Old 
Man, talked with him. Wait .... 
minute — that slug was dead. My 
theory came tumbling down. 

And built up again at once. 
"Mary," I asked, "have you used 
your apartment since the morning you and I had breakfast 
there?" 

"No. Why?" 

"Don't go back there for any 
purpose. 1 recall thinking, while 
I was with them, that I would 
have to boobytrap it." 



"Well, you didn't, did you?" 

"No, but it may have been 
boobytrapped since then. There 
may be the equivalent of Old 
John waiting, spider fashion, for 
you — or me — to return there." I 
explained to her Mcllvaine's 
"group memory" idea. "I thought 
at the time he was spinning the 
dream stuff scientists are so fond 
of. But now it's the only hypothesis I can think of that covers 
everything . . . unless we assume 
that the titans are so stupid that 
they would as soon fish in a bathtub as in a brook. Which they 
aren't." 

"Just a moment, dear. By Dr. 
Mcllvaine's theory, each slug is 
really every other slug; is that 
it? In other words, that thing 
that caught me last night was 
just as much the one that rode 
you when you were with them as 
was the one that actually did 
ride you — Oh, dear, I'm getting 
confused. I mean — " 

"You've got the general idea. 
Apart, they are individuals. In 
direct conference, they merge 
memories and Tweedledum becomes exactly like Tweedledee. 
If that is true, this one last night 
remembers everything learned 
from me, provided it has had 
direct conference with the slug 
that rode me, or a slug that had 
been linked through any number 
of slugs by direct conference to 
the slug that had ridden me, after

the time it did — which you can 
bet it did, from what I know of 
their habits. It would have — the 
first one, I mean. Wait a minute. Take three slugs; Joe, Moe 
and, uh, Herbert. Herbert is the 
one last night; Moe is the one 
which — " 

"Why give them names if they 
are not individuals?" Mary asked. 

"Just to keep them — no reason ; we'll just assume that if 
Mcllvaine is right, there may be 
millions of slugs who know exactly who we are. by name and 
sight and everything, know where 
your apartment is, where mine 
is, and where our cabin is. 
They've got us on a list," 

She frowned. "That's a horrid 
thought, Sam. How would they 
know when to find us at the 
cabin? We didn't tell anybody. 
Would they simply stake it out 
and wait?" 

"They must have. We don't 
know that waiting matters to a 
slug; time may mean something 
different to them." 

"Like Venerians," she suggested. I nodded; a Venerian is 
likely as not to "marry" his own 
great-great-granddaughter — and 
be younger than she is. It depends 
on how they estivate, of course. 

"In any case," I went on, "I've 
got to report this, including our 
guesses, for the boys in the analytical group to play with," 

I was about to go on to say 



that the Old Man would have to 
be especially careful, that it was 
probably he they were really after. But my secret phone embedded under my scalp sounded 
for the first time since leave had 
started. I answered and the Old 
Man's voice cut in ahead of the 
talker's: "Report in person." 

"On our way," I acknowledged. 
"About thirty minutes." 

"Make it sooner. You use Kay 
Five; tell Mary to come in by 
Ell One. Move!" He switched off 
before I could ask him how he 
had known that Mary was with 
me. 

"Did you get it ?" I asked 
Mary. 

"Yes, I was in the circuit." 
"Sounds as if the party was 
about to start." 

"JVTOT until we had landed did 
' I begin to realize how wildly 
the situation had changed. We 
were complying with Schedule 
Bareback; we had not heard of 
Schedule Suntan. Two cops stopped us as we got out. ' ' Sta nd 
still !" one of them ordered. "Don't 
make any sudden moves." 

You would not have known 
they were cops, except for the 
manner and the drawn guns. 
They were dressed in gun belts, 
shoes, and skimpy breech clouts. 
A second glance showed their 
shields clipped to their belts. 
"Now," the same one went on. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

"off with those pants, buddy." 

I did not move quickly enough. 
He barked, "Make it snappy! 
Two have been shot trying to 
escape today; you may be the 
third." 

"Do it, Sam," Mary said 
quietly. I did it. It left me dressed 
in shoes and gloves, feeling like 
a fool — but I managed to keep 
my gun covered as I took off my 
shorts. 

The cop made me turn around. 
His mate said, "He's clean. Now 
the other one." I started to put 
on my shorts; the first cop stopped me. 

"Locking for trouble? Leave 
'em off." 

I said reasonably, "I don't 
want to get picked up for indecent exposure." 

He looked surprised, then guffawed and turned to his mate. 
"You hear that. Ski?" 

i ; second one said patiently, 
"Listen, you got to cooperate. 
You know the rules. You can 
wear a fur coat for all of me — 
but you'll get picked up D.O.A. 
The vigilantes are a lot quicker 
to shoot than we are." He turned 
to Mary. "Now, lady, if you 
please." 

Without argument Mary 
started to remove her shorts. The 
second cop Sf'd kindly, "That 
isn't necessary, Ir.dy, not the way 
those things are built. Just turn 
•round slowly," 



"Thank you," Mary said and 
complied. The policeman's point 
was well taken; Mary's briefies 
and halter appeared to have been 
sprayed on. 

"How about those bandages?" 
the first one commented. 

I answered, "She's been badly 
burned. Can't you see that?" 

He looked doubtfully at the 
sloppy, bulky job I had done on 
the dressings. "Mrmnm," he said, 
"if she was burned." 

"Of course she was burned!" 
I felt my judgment slipping; I 
was the perfect heavy husband, 




108 GAIAXY SCIINCf FICTION 



unreasonable where my wife was 
concerned. "Damn it, look at her 
hair! Would she ruin a head of 
hair like that just to fool you?" 

The first cop said darkly, "One 
of them would." 

The more patient one said, 
"Carl is right, I'm sorry, lady; 
we'll have to disturb those bandages." 

I said excitedly, "You can't 
do that! We're on our way to a 
doctor. You'll just — " 

Mary said, "Help me unroll 
the bandages, Sam." 

I shut up and started to peel 



up one corner of the dressing, my 
hands trembling with rage. Presently the older one whistled and 
said, "I'm satisfied. How about 
you, Carl?" 

"Me, too, Ski. Cripes, girlie,, 
what happened?" 

"Tell them, Sam." 

So I did. The older cop finally 
commented, "So it's cats now. 
Dogs I knew about. Horses, yes. 
But you wouldn't think the ordinary cat could carry one." His 
face clouded. "We got a cat and 
now we'll have to get rid of it, 
My kids won't like that."

"I'm sorry," Mary told him. 

"It's a bad time for everybody. 
Okay, folks, you can go." 

"Wait a minute," 1 the first one 
said. "Ski, if she goes through 
the streets with that thing on her 
back, somebody is likely to burn 
her." 

The older one scratched his 
chin. "That's true. We'll just have 
to dig up a prowl car." 

Which they did. I had to pay 
the charges on the rented wreck, 
then went along as far as Mary's 
entrance. It was in a hotel 
through a private elevator; I got 
in with her to avoid explanations, 
then went back up after she got 
out at a level lower than the 
obvious controls of the car provided for. I was tempted to go 
in with her, but the Old Man had 
ordered me to come in by Kay 
Five. 

I was tempted, too, to put my 
shorts on. In the prowl car and 
during a quick march through 
a side door of the hotel, with 
police around us to keep Mary 
from being shot, I had not minded 
much — but it took nerve to face 
the world without pants. 

I need not have worried. The 
short distance I had to go was 
enough to show me that a basic 
custom had gone with last year's 
frost. Most men were wearing 
clouts, but I was not the only 
man naked to his shoes. One in 
particular I remember; he was 



leaning against a street roof 
stanchion and searching with cold 
eyes every passerby. He was 
wearing nothing but slippers and 
a brassard lettered "vig" and he 
was cradling an Owens mob gun. 
I saw three more like him; I was 
glad that I was carrying my 
shorts. 

Few women were naked, but 
the rest might as well have been 
— string brassieres, translucent 
trunks* nothing that could hide 
a slug. Most of the women would 
have looked better in togas. That 
was my first impression, but before long even that had worn off. 
Ugly bodies weren't any more 
noticeable than ugly taxicabs; the 
eye ignored them. Skin was skin 
and what of it? 

1 was let in to see the Old Man 
at once. He looked up and 
growled, "You're late." 

I answered, "Where's Mary?" 

"In the infirmary, getting 
treated and dictating her report. 
Let's see your hands." 

"I'll show them to the doctor, 
thanks. What's up?" 

"If you would ever bother to 
listen to a newscast," he grumbled, "you would know what was 
up."

HAD Mary and I watched the 
stereo, our honeymoon would 
never have gotten to first base.

My suspicion that the slugs could 
hide themselves on any part of 
the body and still control hosts 
had been correct; it had been 
proved by experiment before 
Mary and I had holed up on the 
mountain, although I had not 
seen the report. I suppose the Old 
Man knew it. Certainly the President and the high brass did. 

So Schedule Suntan replaced 
Schedule Bareback and everybody skinned down to the buff — 
Like hell they did! The matter 
was still "Top Secret" at the time 
of the Scranton Riot. Don't ask 
me why ; our government has 
gotten the habit of classifying 
information, practically all information, a Mother - Knows Best-Dear policy. The Scranton 
Riot should have convinced anybody that the slugs were loose 
in Zone Green, but even that did 
not bring on Schedule Suntan. 

The fake air raid alarm on the 
East Coast took place, as I figure 
it, the third day of our honeymoon; afterward it took a while 
to figure out what had hapened, 
even though it was obvious that 
lighting could not fail by accident in so many different shelters. 
It gives me horrors to think about 
it — all those people crouching in 
the darkness, waiting for the 
all-clear, while zombies moved 
among them, slapping slugs on 
them. Apparently in some air 
raid bunkers the recruitment was 



one hundred per cent. 

So there were more riots the 
next day and we were well into 
the Terror. Technically, the start 
of vigilantism came the first time 
a desperate citizen pulled a gun 
on a cop — Maurice T. Kaufman 
of Albany was the citizen, and 
the cop was Sergeant Malcolm 
MacDonald. Kaufman was dead 
a half second later and MacDonald followed him. torn to pieces 
by the mob, along with his titan 
master. But the vigilantes did not 
really get going until the air raid 
wardens put organization into the 
movement. 

The wardens, being stationed 
above ground during raids, largely escaped, but they felt responsible. Not that all vigilantes were 
wardens, but a stark naked, 
armed men on the street was as 
likely to be wearing a warden's 
armband as the VK3 brassard. 
Either way, you could count on 
him shooting at any unexplained 
excrescence on a human body — 
shoot and investigate afterward. 

WHILE my hands were 
dressed, I was brought up 
to date. The doctor gave me s 
short shot of tempus and I spent 
the time — subjective, about three 
days: objective, less than an hour 
— studying stereo tapes through 
an overspeed scanner. This gadget has never been released lo 
the public, though it is bootlegged

et some of the colleges around 
examination week. You adjust the 
speed to match your subjective 
rate and use an audio frequency 
stepdown to let you hear what is 
being said. It is hard on the eyes, 
but it is a big help in cramming. 

It was hard to believe that so 
much could have happened. Take 
dogs. A vigilante would kill a 
dog on sight, even though it was 
not wearing a slug — because it 
was even money that it would be 
wearing one before sunrise, that 
it would attack a man and that 
the titan would change riders in 
the dark. 

A hell of a world where you 
could not trust dogs! 

Apparently cats were hardly 
ever used ; poor old Pirate was 
an exception. But in Zone Green 
dogs were rarely seen now by 
day. They filtered out of Zone 
Red at night, traveled in the dark 
and hid out at dawn. They kept 
showing up even on the coasts. 
It made one think of werewolf 
legends. 

I scanned dozens of tapes which 
had been monitored from Zone 
Red. They fell into three time 
groups: the masquerade period, 
when the slugs had been continuing the "normal" broadcasts; 
a short period of counter -propaganda, during which the slugs 
had tried to convince citizens in 
Zone Green that the government 
had gone crazy; and the current 



period in which pretense had 
dropped. 

According to Dr. Mcllvaine, 
the titans have no true culture; 
they are parasitic even in that 
and merely adapt the culture they 
find. Maybe he assumes too much, 
but that is what they did in 
Zone Red. The slugs would have 
to maintain the basic economic 
activity of their victims, since the 
slugs would starve if the hosts 
did. They continued that economy with variations that we 
would not use — that business of 
processing damaged and excess 
people in fertilizer plants, for example — but in general farmers 
stayed farmers, mechanics went 
on being mechanics, and bankers 
were still bankers. That last 
seems odd, but experts claim that 
any "division-of-labor" economy 
requires an accounting system. 

But why did they continue 
human recreations? Is the desire 
to be amused a universal need? 
What they picked from human 
ideas of fun to keep and "improve 
on" does not speak well for us, 
although some of their variations 
may have merit. That stunt they 
pulled in Mexico, for example, of 
giving the bull an even break with 
the matador. 

But most of it just makes one 
sick and I won't elaborate. I am 
one of the few who saw even 
transcriptions on such things; I 
saw them professionally. I hoped 



112 




 



that Mary, in her -briefing, did not 
have to look at them, but Mary 
would never say so if she had. 

There was one thing I 
saw in the tapes so outrageous, 
so damnably disgusting that I 
hesitate to mention it, though I 
feel I must. There were men and 
women here and there among the 
slaves, humans — if you could 
call them that — without slugs. 

I hate slugs, but I would turn 
from killing a slug to kill a renegade. 

WE were losing ground everywhere; our methods were 
effective only in stopping their 
spread, and not fully effective in 
that. To fight them directly we 
would have to bomb our own 
cities, with no certainty of killing 
the titans. What we needed was 
a weapon that would kill slugs 
but not men, or something that 
would disable humans or render 
unconscious without killing and 
thereby permit us to rescue our 
compatriots. No such weapon was 
available, though the scientists 
were all busy on the problem. A 
"sleep" gas would have been perfect, but it is lucky that no such 
gas was known before the invasion, or the slugs could have used 
it against us. It must be remembered that the slugs then had as 
much, or more, of the military 
potential of the United States at 
their disposal as had the free men. 



Stalemate — With time on their 
side. There were fools who wanted 
to H-bomb the cities of the Mississippi Valley out of existence, 
like curing a lip cancer by cutting 
off the head, but they were offset 
by their twins who had not seen 
slugs, and felt that the whole matter was a tyrannical Washington 
plot. The second sort grew fewer 
each day, not because they 
changed their minds but because 
the vigilantes were awfully eager. • 

Then there was the tertium 
quid, the flexible mind, the "reasonable" man — he favored negotiation, claiming we could "do 
business" with the titans. One 
such committee, a delegation 
from the caucus of the opposition 
party in Congress, actually tried 
it. Bypassing the State Department, they got in touch with the 
Governor of Missouri via a linkage rigged across Zone Amber, 
and were assured of safe conduct and diplomatic immunity— 
"guarantees" from a titan, but 
they accepted them. They went 
to St. Louis and never came back. 
They sent messages, though. I ■ 
saw one, a rousing speech adding 
up to, "Come on in, the water is 
fine!" 

Do steers sign treaties with 
meat packers? 

NORTH America was still the 
one known center of infection . The only action by the 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



ni 



United Nations, other than placing the space stations at our disposal, was to move to Geneva. 
It was voted, with twenty-three 
nations abstaining, to define our 
plight as "civi! disorder" and to 
urge each member nation to give 
such aid as it saw fit to the legitimate governments of the United 
States. Mexico, and Canada. 

It remained a creeping war, 
silent, with battles lost before we 
even knew they were joined. Conventional weapons were hardly 
useful except in policing Zone 
Amber, now a double no-man'sland from the Canadian forests 
to the Mexican deserts. It was 
deserted in the daytime, save for 
our own patrols. 

At night our scouts drew back 
and the dogs came through — and 
other things. 

Only one atom bomb had been 
used in the entire war, and that 
against a Saucer which landed 
near San Francisco south of Burlingamc. Its destruction was according to doctrine, but the 
doctrine was under criticism; it 
should have been captured for 
study. I found my sympathies 
with those who wanted to shoot 
first and study later. 

By the time the dose of tempus 
was wearing off, I had a picture 
of the United States in a shape 
that I had not imagined even 
when I was in Kansas City . . . 
a country undergoing Terror. 

114 I 



Friend might shoot friend, wife 
denounce husband. Rumor of a 
titan could drum up a mob on 
any street, with Judge Lynch 
baying in the van. To rap on a 
door at night was to invite a 
blast through the pane. Honest 
folk stayed home; at night the 
dogs were out. 

The fact that most of the rumored discoveries of slugs were 
baseless made them no less dangerous. It was not exhibitionism 
which caused many people to 
prefer outright nudity to the tight 
and scanty clothing permitted 
under Schedule Suntan; even the 
skimpiest clothing invited a suspicion that might be decided too 
abruptly. The head - and - spine 
armor was never worn now; the 
slugs had faked it and used it 
almost at once. 

And there had been the case 
of a girl in Seattle. She had been 
dressed in sandals and a big 
purse, nothing else. But a vigilante who apparently had developed a nose for the enemy 
followed her, and noticed that 
she never moved the purse from 
her right hand, even when she 
opened it to make change. She 
lived, for he burned her arm off 
at the wrist, and I suppose that 
she had a new one grafted on; 
the supply of such spare parts 
was a glut. The slug was alive, 
too, when the vigilante opened 
the purse — but not for long. 


 



The drug had worn) off by the 
time I scanned this incident and 
I mentioned the matter to the 
nurse. "Mustn't worry," she told 
me. "It does no good. Now flex 
the fingers of your right hand, 
please.*' 

I flexed them, while she helped 
the doctor spray on surrogate 
skin. "Wear gloves for rough 
work," the doctor cautioned, "and 
come back next week." I thanked 
them and went to the operations 
office. I looked for Mary first, 
but she was busy in Cosmetics. 

XXV 

"TTANDS all right?" the Old 
Man asked. 

"They'll do. False skin for a 
week. They do a graft job on my 
ear tomorrow." 

He looked vexed. "There's no 
time for a graft to heal; Cosmetics will have to fake one." 

"The ear doesn't matter," I told 
him, "but why bother to fake it? 
Impersonation job?" 

"Not exactly. Now that you've 
been briefed, what do you think 
of the situation?" 

I wondered what answer he 
was fishing for. "Not good," I 
conceded. "Everybody watching 
everybody else. Might as well be 
in Russia." 

"Speaking of Russia, would 
you say that it was easier to penetrate and maintain surveillance 



in Russia or in Zone Red? Which 
would you rather tackle?" 

I eyed him suspiciously. 
"What's the catch? You don't 
let a man pick his assignment." 

"I asked your professional 
opinion." 

"I don't have enough data. 
Have the slugs infested Russia?** 

"That," he answered, "is what, 
I must find out." 

I realized suddenly that Mary 
had been right; agents should not 
marry. "This time of year," I 
said, "I think I'd want to enter 
through Canton. Unless you were 
figuring on a drop." 

"What makes you think I want 
you to go there?" he asked. "We 
might find out quicker and easier 
in Zone Red." 

"What? How?" 

"Certainly. If there is infection 
anywhere but in this continent, 
the titans in Zone Red must know 
it. Why go half around the globe 
to find out?" 

I put aside the plans I had 
been forming to be a Hindu merchant, traveling with his wife, 
and thought about what he was 
saying. 

"How in the devil can Zone 
Red be penetrated now?" I asked. 
"Do I wear a plastic imitation 
slug on my shoulders? They'd 
catch me the first time I was 
called on for direct conference." 

"Don't be a defeatist. Four 
agents have gone in already."

"And come back?" 

"Well, not exactly." 

"Have you decided that I've 
cluttered up the payroll long 
enough?" 

"I think the others used the 
wrong tactics — " 

"Yeah, I'd say so." 

"The trick is to convince them 
that you are a renegade. Got any 
ideas?" 

The idea was so overwhelming 
that I did not answer at once. 
Finally I burst out, "Why not 
start me easy? Can't I impersonate a Panama pimp for a 
while? Or practice being an axe 
murderer? I have to get in the 
mood for this." 

"You've had more experience 
With their ways than any agent 
I've got. You must be rested up, 
aside from that little singe on 
your fingers. Or maybe we should 
drop you near Moscow and let 
you take a direct look. Think it 
over. Don't get into a fret about 
it for a day or so." 

"Thank you too much." I 
changed the subject. "What have 
you got planned for Mary?" 

"Why don't you stick to your 
own business?" 

"I'm married to her." 

"I know." 

"Well, for the love of Pete, 
don't you even want to wish me 

luck?" 

"It strikes me," he said slowly, 
"that yo.u have had all the luck 

116 



one man could ask for. You have 
my blessing, for whatever it's 
worth." 

"Oh." Up to that moment, it 
had not occurred to me that the 
Old Man might have had something to do with Mary's leave 
and mine falling together so conveniently. I said, "Look here. 
Dad—" 

"Huh?" It was the second time 
I had called him that in a month; 
it put him, on the defensive. 

"You meant for Mary and me 
to marry all along. You planned 
it that way." 

"Don't be ridiculous. I believe 
in free will, son — and free choices. 
Both of you were entitled to leave. 
The rest was accidental." 

"Accidents don't happen; not 
around you. Never mind, I'm 
satisfied with the outcome. Now 
about the job — give me a bit 
longer to size up the possibilities. 
Meantime, I'll see Cosmetics 
about a rubber ear." 

XXVI 

WE finally decided not to attempt to penetrate Zone 
Red. The evaluation group had 
advised there was no chance of 
impersonating a renegade : the 
question hinged on, "How does a 
man get to be a renegade? Why 
do the titans trust him?" It answers itself ; a slug knows its 
host's mind. If a titan, through 

AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



possessing a man's mind, -knows 
that he is a natural renegade, a 
man who can be had, then it may 
suit the slug's purposes to let him 
be renegade rather than host. But 
first the slug had to plumb the 
vileness in the man's mind and 
be sure of its quality. 

We concluded this from logical 
necessity. Human logic, but it had 
to be slug logic, too, since it fitted 
what the slugs could and could 
not do. As for me, it was not possible even under deep hypnotic 
instruction to pass myself off as 
a candidate for renegade, or so 
the psycho lads decided, and to 
which I said, "Amen!" 

It may seem illogical that titans 
would "free" a host even though 
they knew that the host was the 
sort who could be owned. But in 
the renegades the slugs had a supply of "trustworthy" fifth columnists — "trustworthy" is not the 
right word, but no language has 
a word for this form of treachery. 
That Zone Green was being penetrated by renegades was certain, 
but it is often hard to tell a fifth 
columnist from a custard head, 
which made them hard to catch. 

So I got ready. I took under 
hynosis a refresher in the languages I would need, with emphasis on the latest shibboleth 
phrases; I was provided with a 
personality and given a load of 
money. The reporting equipment 
was a new model and a joy to 



have, ultra -microwave stuff hardly larger than a loaf of bread, and 
the power pack so well shielded 
that it would not make a Geiger 
counter even nervous. 

I had to drop through their 
screen, but it would be under a 
blanket of anti-radar "window" to 
give their search technicians fits. 
Once inside I had to make up my 
mind whether or not the Russian 
axis was slug-infested, then dictate a report to whatever space 
station was in sight. In line-ofsight, that is; I can't pick out a 
space station by eye, and I doubt 
those who say they can. Report 
made, I was free to walk, ride, 
crawl, sneak and/or bribe my way 
out if I could. 

But I never had a chance to 
use these preparations; the Pass 
Christian Saucer landed. 

IT was only the third to be seen 
" after landing. The Grinnell 
Saucer had been concealed by the 
slugs and the Burlingame Saucer 
was a radioactive memory. But 
the Pass Christian one was both 
tracked and seen on the ground. 

It was tracked by Space Station 
Alpha and recorded as an "extremely large meteorite." The 
mistake was caused by its great 
speed. The primitive radar of 
sixty-odd years ago had picked 
up Saucers many times, especially 
cruising at atmospheric speeds 
while scouting this planet. But 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



our modern radar has been "improved" to the point where Saucers could not be seen; our instruments are too specialized. 
Traffic block control sees atmospheric traffic only. The defense 
screen and fire control radars see 
only what they are supposed to 
see. The fine screen "sees" a range 
from atmospheric speeds up to 
orbiting missiles at five miles a 
second. The coarse screen overlaps the fine screen, starting down 
at the lowest missile speed and 
carrying on up to about ten miles 
per second. 

There are other setectivities, 
but none of them sees objects at 
speeds over ten miles per second 
— with the single exception of 
space station meteor-count radars, 
which are not military. Consequently the "giant meteor" was 
not associated with Flying Saucers until later. 

But the Pass Christian Saucer 
was seen to land. The submersible 
cruiser U.N.S. Robert Fulton on 
patrol of Zone Red out of 
Mobile was seven miles off Gulfport with only her receptors 
showing when the Saucer landed. 
The spaceship popped up on the 
screens of the cruiser as it dropped from outer space speedaround fifty-three miles per second, by the space station record 
—to a speed the cruiser's radars 
would accept. 

It came out of nothing, slowed 



to zero, and disappeared — but the 
operator had a fix on the last blip, 
a few miles away on the Missis-' 
sippi coast. The cruiser's skipper 
was puzzled. The track surely 
could not be a ship; ships don't 
decelerate at fifty gravities! It did 
not occur to him that that might 
not matter to a slug. He swung 
his ship over and took a look. 
His first despatch read: space* 

SHIP LANDED BEACH WEST OF PASS 
CHRISTIAN MISSISSIPPI. HlS second 
Was: LANDING FORCE BEACHING TO 
CAPTURE. 

If I had not been in the Section 
offices preparing for my drop, I 
might have been left out of the 
party. As it was, my phone 
shrilled; I bumped my head on 
the study machine and swore. 
The Old Man said, "Come at 
once. Move!" 

It was the same party we had 
started with so many weeks — or 
years? — before, the Old Man, 
Mary and myself. We were heading south at emergency maximum 
before the Old Man told us the 
reason. 

When he did, I said, "Why the 
family group? You need a fullscale atr task force." 

"It will be there," he answered 
grimly. Then he grinned his old 
wicked grin. "What do you care? 
The 'Cavanaughs* are riding 
again. Eh, Mary?" 

I snorted. "If you want that 
sister and -brother routine, you 



11» 




 



had better get another boy." 

"Just the part where you protect her from dogs and strange 
men," he answered soberly. "And 
1 do mean dogs and I do mean 
very strange men. This may be 
the payoff, son." 

He went into the operator's 
compartment, closed the panel, 
and got busy at the communicator. I turned to Mary. She 
snuggled up and said, "Howdy, 
Bud." 

I grabbed her. "Don't give me 
that 'Bud* stuff or somebody's 
going to get a paddling." 

WE were almost shot down by 
our own boys. Then we 
picked up an escort of two Black 
Angels who turned us over to the 
command ship from which Air 
Marshal Rexton was watching the 
action. The command ship 
took us inboard with an anchor 
loop. I found the maneuver disconcerting. 

Rexton wanted to spank us and 
send us home, but spanking the 
Old Man is a chore. They finally 
unloaded us and I squatted our 
car down on the seawall roadway 
west of Pass Christian — scared 
silly, I should add: we were buffeted by A. A. on the way down. 
There was fighting all around and 
above us, but there was a curious 
calm near the Saucer itself. 

The outlander ship loomed up 
almost over us, not fifty yards 



away. It was as convincing and as 
ominous as the plastic-board fake 
in Iowa had been phony. It was 
a discus of great size, tilted slightly toward us; it had grounded 
partly on one of the high-stilted 
old mansions which line that 
coast. The Saucer was partly 
supported by the wreckage and 
by the thick trunk of a tree that 
had shaded the house. 

Its canted attitude let us see 
the upper surface and what was 
surely its airlock — a metal hemisphere, a dozen feet across, at its 
center. This hemisphere was lifted 
out or up from the body of the 
ship some six or eight feet. I could 
not see what held it out, but I 
assumed that there must be a central shaft or piston; it came out 
like a poppet valve. It was easy 
to see why the Saucer had not 
closed up again and taken off. 
The airlock was fouled, held open 
by a "mud turtle," one of those 
little amphibious tanks that were 
part of the landing force of the 
Fulton. 

Let me place this on record. 
The tank had been commanded 
by Ensign Gilbert Calhoun of 
Knoxville. With him was Powerman 2/c Florence Berzowski and 
a gunner named Booker T. W. 
Johnson. They were all dead, of 
course, before we got there. 

The car, as soon as I ronded. 
it, was surrounded by a landing 
force squad commanded by m 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



pink-cheeked lad who seemed 
anxious to shoot somebody, anybody. He was less anxious when 
he got a look at Mary, but he still 
refused to let us appoach the 
Saucer until he had checked with 
his tactical commander, who in 
turn consulted the skipper of the 
Fulton. We got an answer back in 
short time, considering that it was 
probably referred clear to Washington. 

While waiting, I watched the 
battle and was pleased to have 
no part of it. Somebody was going 
" to get hurt. A good many had already. There was a male body 
just behind the car — a boy not 
more than fourteen. He was still 
clutching a rocket launcher and 
across his shoulders was the mark 
of the beast. I wondered whether 
the slug had crawled away and 
was dying, or whether, perhaps, 
it had managed to transfer to the 
person who had killed the boy. 

Mary had walked west on the 
highway with the downy young 
naval officer while I was examining the corpse. The notion of a 
slug, possibly still alive, being 
around caused me to hurry to 
her. "Get back into the car," I 
said. 

She continued to look west 
alon^ the road. "I thought I 
might get in a shot or two," she 
answered, her eyes bright. 

"She's safe here," the youngster assured me. "We're holding 



them, well down the road." 

I ignored him. "Listen, you 
bloodthirsty little hellion," I 
snapped, "get back in that car 
before I break every bone in your 
body !" 

"Yes, Sam." She turned and 
did so. 

I looked back at the young 
salt. "What are you staring at?" 
I demanded. The place smelled 
of slugs and the wait was making 
me nervous. 

"Nothing much," he said, looking me over. "In my part of the 
country we don't speak to ladies 
that way." 

"Then why in hell don't you 
go back where you come from?" 
I answered and stalked away. The 
Old Man was missing, too; I did 
not like it. 

An ambulance, coming back 
from the west, ground to a halt 
beside me. "Has the road to 
Pascagoula been opened?" the 
driver called out. 

The Pascagoula River, thirty 
miles east of where the Saucer 
had landed, was roughly "Zone 
Amber" for that area. The town 
of that name was east of the 
river's mouth and in Zone Green, 
while sixty or seventy miles west 
of us on the same road was New 
Orleans, the heaviest concentration of titans south of St. Louis. 
Our opposition came from New 
Orleans. Our nearest base was in 
Mobile.

"I haven't heard," 1 told the 
driver. 

He chewed a knuckle. "Well, I 
made it through. Maybe I'll make 
it back." His turbines whined and 
he was away. I continued to look 
for the Old man. 

Although the ground fighting 
had moved from the site, the air 
fighting was all around us. I was 
watching vapor trails and trying 
to figure out who was what and 
how they could tell, when a big 
transport streaked into the area, 
put on the brakes with a burst of 
rato units, and spilled a platoon 
of sky boys. Again I wondered; it 
was too far away to tell whether 
they wore slugs or not. At least it 
came in from the east. 

I spotted the Old Man talking 
with the landing force commander. I went up and interrupted. 
"We ought to get out of here, 
boss. This place is due to be 
atom-bombed ten minutes ago." 

The commander answered. 
"Relax. The concentration does 
not merit even a pony bomb." 

I was about to ask him sharply 
how he knew that the slugs would 
figure it that way, when the Old 
Man interrupted. "He's right, 
son." He took my arm and walked me back toward the car. "He's 
right, but for the wrong reasons." 

"Huh?" 

"Why haven't we bombed the 
cities they hold? They don't want 
to damage that ship; they want 



it back. Get on back to Mary. 
Dogs and strange men- — remem* 
ber?" 

I shut up, unconvinced. I expected us all to be clicks in a 
Geiger counter any second. Slugs 
fought with gamecock recklessness, perhaps because they were 
really not individuals. Why 
should they be more cautious 
about one of their ships? They 
might be more anxious to keep it 
out of our hands than to save it. 

We had just reached the car 
and spoken to Mary when the 
still -damp youngster came trotting up. He saluted the Old Man. 
"The Commander says that you 
are to have anything you want, 
sir — anything at all!" 

From his manner I gathered 
that the answering despatch had 
been spelled out in flaming letters, accompanied by ruffles and 
flourishes. "Thank you, sir," the 
Old Man said mildly. "We merely want to inspect the captured 
ship." 

"Yes, sir. Come with me, sir.** 
He came with us instead, having 
difficulty deciding whether to escort the Old Man or Mary. Mary 
won. I followed, keeping my mind 
on watching out and ignoring the 
presence of the youngster. The 
country on that coast, unless gardened, is practically jungle; the 
Saucer lapped over into a brake 
of that sort and the Old Man 
took a shortcut through it. The 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



t21 



kid said, "Watch out, sir. Mind 
where you step." 
, I said, "Slugs?" 

He shook his head. "Coral 
snakes." 

At that point a poisonous 
snake would have seemed as 
pleasant as a honey bee, but I 
must have been paying some attention to his warning for I was 
looking down when I first heard 
a shout- Then, so help me, a 
Bengal tiger was charging us! 

Probably Mary got in the first 
shot," Mine was not behind that of 
the young officer; it might even 
have been ahead. The Old Man 
shot last. Between us we cut that 
beast so many ways that it would 
never make a rug. And yet the 
slug on it was untouched; I fried 
it with my second bolt. 

The young fellow looked at it 
Without surprise. "Well," he said, 
"I thought we had cleaned up 
that load." 

"What do you mean?" 

"One of the first transport 
tanks they sent out. Regular 
Noah's Ark. We were shooting 
everything from gorillas to polar 
bears. Say, did you ever have a 
water buffalo come at you?" 

"No, and I don't want to." 

"Not as bad as the dogs, really. 
If you ask me, those things don't 
have much sense." He looked at 
the slug, quite unmoved. 

We got out of there fast and 
onto the titan ship — which did 



not make me less nervous, but 
more. Not that there was anything frightening in the appearance of the ship itself, but its appearance wasn't right. While it 
was artificial, one knew without 
being told that it was not made 
by men. Why? I don't know. Its 
surface was dull mirror, not a 
mark on it — not any sort of mark; 
there was no way to tell how it 
had been put together. It was as 
smooth as a Jo block. 

I could not figure what it was 
made of . Metal? Of course, it had 
to be metal. But was it? You 
would expect it to be either bitterly cold or possibly intensely 
hot from its landing. I touched it 
and it was not anything at all, 
neither cold nor hot. I noticed another thing presently. A ship that 
size, landing at high speed, should 
have blasted a couple of acres. 
There was no blast area at all; 
the brake around it was green and 
rank. 

We went up to the parasol 
business, the airlock, if that is 
what it was. The edge was jammed down on the little mud turtle; the armor of the tank was 
crushed in, as one might crush a 
pasteboard box with the hand. 
Those mud turtles are built to 
launch five hundred feet deep in 
water; they are strong. 

Well, I suppose this one was 
strong. The parasol arrangement 
had damaged it, but the airlock 




 



had not closed, On the other hand 
the metal, or whatever the spaceship's door was made of, was unmarked by the exchange. 

The Old Man turned to me. 
"Wait here with Mary." 

"You're going in there by yourself?" 

"Yes. There may be very little 
time," 

The kid spoke up. "I'm to stay 
with you, sir. That's what the 
Commander said." 

"Very well, sir," the Old Man 
agreed. "Come along." He peered 
over the edge, then knelt and 
lowered himself by his hands. The 
kid followed him. I felt burned 
up, but had no desire to argue the 
arrangements. 

Mary turned to me and said, 
"Sam, I don't like this. I'm 
afraid." 

She startled me. I was afraid 
myself, but I had not expected 
her to be. "I'll take care of you." 

"Do we have to stay? He didn't 
actually say so." 

I considered it. "If you want to 
go back to the car, I'll take you 
there." 

"Well . . . no, Sam, I guess we 
have to stay. Come closer to me.'* 
She was trembling. 

T DON'T know how long it was 
before they stuck their heads 
over the rim. The youngster 
climbed out and the Old Man 
told him to stand guard. "Come 



on," he said to us. "It's safe — I 
think." 

"The hell it is," I told him, but 
I went because Mary was already 
starting. The Old Man helped her 
down. 

"Mind your head," he said, 
"Low bridge all the way." 

It is a platitude that unhuman 
races produce unhuman works, 
but very few humans have ever 
been inside a Venerian labyrinth 
and still fewer have seen the Martian ruins — and I was not one of 
the few. I don't know what I expected. 

Superficially, the inside of the 
Saucer was hot, I suppose, too 
startling, but it was strange. It 
had been thought out by unhuman brains, ones which had 
never heard of the right angle and 
the straight line, or regarded them 
as unnecessary or undesirable. 

We found ourselves in a small 
oblate chamber, and from there 
we crawled through a tube about 
four feet thick, which seemed to 
wind down into the ship, ahd 
glowed from all its surface with 
a reddish light. 

The tube held an odd and 
somewhat distressing odor, ns if 
of marsh gas, and mixed with it 
faintly was the reek of dead slugs. 
That and the reddish glow and 
the total lack of heat response 
from the wall of the tube, as my 
palms pressed against it, gave me 
the unpleasant fancy that I was 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



crawling through the gut of some 
unearthly behemoth, rather than 
exploring a strange machine. 

The tube branched like an artery and there we came across our 
first Titanian androgyne. He — 
let me call it "he" — was sprawled 
on his back, like a child sleeping, 
his head pillowed on his slug. 
Theje was a suggestion of a smile 
on the little rosebud mouth. I did 
not realize that lie was dead. 

At first sight, the similarities 
between the Titanian people and 
ourselves are more noticeable 
than the differences; we impress 
what we expect to see on what we 
do see. Take the pretty little 
"mouth" for example — how was 
I to know that it was an organ 
for breathing solely? 

But despite the casual similarities of four limbs and a headlike 
protuberance, wc are less alike 
than a bullfrog and bullpup. 
Nevertheless the general effect is 
pleasing and faintly human. "Elfin," I should say— the elves of 
Saturn's moons. 

When I saw the little fellow, I 
managed to draw my gun. The 
Old Man turned and said, "Take 
it easy. It's dead. They are all 
dead, smothered in oxygen when 
the tank ruined their air seal." 

I still had my gun out. "I want 
to burn the slug," I insisted. "It 
may still be alive." It was not 
covered by the shell we had lately 
come to expect, but was naked 



and ugly. Very naked and ugly. 

He shrugged. "Suit yourself. It 
can't possibly hurt you. That slug 
can't live on an oxygen breather." 
He crawled across the little body, 
giving me no chance to shoot had 
I decided to. Mary had not 
drawn, but had shrunk against 
my side and was breathing in 
sharp, sobbing gasps. The Old 
Man stopped and said patiently, 
"Coming, Mary?" 

She choked, "Let's get out of 
here!" 

I said, "She's right. This is no 
job for three people. This is something for a research team and 
proper equipment." 

He paid no attention to me. "It 
has to be done, Mary. You know 
that. And you have to be the one 
to do it." 

"Why does she have to do it?" 
I demanded angrily. 

Again he ignored me. "Well, 
Mary?" 

From somewhere inside she 
called on reserves. Her breathing 
became normal, her features relaxed, and she crawled across the 
slug-ridden elfin body with the 
serenity of a queen going to the 
gallows. I lumbered after, still 
hampered by my gun and trying 
not to touch the corpse. 

We came at last to a large 
chamber which may have been 
the control room ; there were 
many of the dead little elfin creatures in it. Its inner surface wai

ca vita ted and picked out with 
lights much brighter than the reddish illumination, and the space 
was festooned with processes as 
meaningless to me as the convolutions of a brain. I was 
troubled again with the thought — 
completely wrong — that the ship 
itself was a living organism. 

The Old Man paid no mind but 
crawled through and into another 
ruddy-glowing tube. We followed 
its contortions to where it widened out to ten feet or more with a 
"ceiling" almost tall enougli to let 
us stand erect. But that was not 
what caught our eyes; the walls 
were no longer opaque. 

On each side of us, beyond 
transparent membranes, were 
thousands on thousands of slugs, 
swimming, floating, writhing in 
some fluid which sustained them. 
Each tank had an inner diffuse 
light of its own that let me see 
back into the palpitating mass — 
and I wanted to scream. 

I still had my gun out! The Old 
Man placed his hand over the 
bell of it. "You don't want to let 
that loose in here," he warned me. 
"Those are for us." 

Mary looked at them with a 
face too calm. I doubt that she 
was fully conscious in the ordinary sense. I looked at her, 
glanced back at the walls of that 
ghoulish aquarium, and said urgently, "Let's get out of here if 
we can, then just bomb it out of 



existence. Before it's too Iatc! M 

"No," he said quietly, "there is 
more. Come." The tube narrowed 
in again, then enlarged, and we 
were in a somewhat smaller 
chamber. Again there were transparent walls; again there were 
things floating beyond them. 

I had to look twice before I 
could believe what I saw. 

Floating just beyond the wall, 
face down, was the body of a man 
— a human, Earth-born man — 
about forty to fifty years old. His 
arms were curved across his chest 
and his knees were drawn up, as 
if he were sleeping. 

He was not alone : there were 
more beyond him, male and female, young and old, but be got 
my attention. I was sure that he 
was dead; it did not occur to me 
to think otherwise — then T saw 
his mouth working — and then I 
wished he were dead. 

TVJARY was wandering around 
as if she were drunk. No, not 
drunk, but preoccupied and 
dazed. She went from one wall to 
the other, peering into the crowded, half-seen depths. The Old 
Man looked only at her. "Well, 
Mary?" he asked softly. 

"I can't find them!" she said 
piteously in a voice like a little 
girl's. She ran back to the other 
side. 

The Old Man grasped her arm. 
** You're not looking for them in 



THE FUPPET MASTERS 



he whispered fiercely. "Keep out 
of this — you must keep out." 
"But — " 

"No!" He let go of Mary and 
led me to the entrance. "Stay 
there. And as you love your wife, 
as you hate the titans, do not in



terfere. I shan't hurt her. I promise." 

"What are you going to do?" 
But he had turned away. I stayed, 
unwilling, yet afraid to tamper 
with what I did not understand. 

Mary had sunk to the floor like 
a child, face covered with hands. 
The Old Man knelt down and 
touched her arm. "Go back," X 
heard him say. "Back to where it 
started." 

I could barely hear her answer. 
"No . . . no." 

"How old were you? You seemed to be about seven or eight 
when you were found. It was before that?" 

"Yes — yes, it was before that." 
She sobbed, "Mama! Mama!" 

"What is your mama saying?** 
he asked gently. 

"She doesn't say anything. 
She's looking* at me so queerly. 
There's something on her back. 
I'm afraid!" 

I hurried toward them, crouching to keep from hitting the low 
ceiling. Without taking his eyes 
off Mary, the Old Man motioned 
me back. I stopped, hesitated. 
"Go back," he ordered. "Way 
back." 

The words were directed at me 
and I obeyed them — but so did 
Mary. 

"There was a ship," she muttered, "a big, shiny ship — " He 
said something; if she answered, 
I could not hear it. I stayed back

this time. Despite my vastly disturbed emotions, I realized that 
something important was going 
on, something big enough to absorb the Old Man's full attention 
in the presence of the enemy. 

He continued to talk soothingly 
but insistently. Mary quieted, 
seemed to sink into lethargy. 
After a while she was talking in 
the monotonous logorrhea of 
emotional release. Only occasionally did he prompt her. 

1 heard something crawling 
along the passage behind me, 
turned and drew my gun, with a 
wild feeling that we were trapped. 
I almost shot him before I recognized the ubiquitous young officer we had left outside. "Come 
out!" he said urgently. He pushed 
past me into the chamber and 
repeated the demand to the Old 
Man. m 

The Old Man looked exasperated beyond endurance. "Shut up 
and don't bother me," he said. 

"You've got to, sir," the youngster insisted. "The Commander 
says that you must come out at 
once. We're falling back; he says 
he may have to use demolition at 
any moment. If we are still inside — blooie!" 

"Very well," the Old Man 
a-greed calmly. "Go tell your commander that he must hold off 
until we get out; I have vitally 
important information. Son, help 
me with Mary.** 



"Aye aye. sir!" the youngster 
acknowledged. "But hurry!" He 
scrambled away. I picked up 
Mary and carried her to where 
the chamber narrowed into a 
tube; she seemed almost unconscious. I put her down. 

"Mary," I shouted. "Mary! 
Can you hear me?" 

Her eyes opened. "Yes, Sam?" 

"Darling, we've got to get out 
of here, fast! Can you crawl?" 

"Yes, Sam." She closed her 
eyes. 

I shook her again. "Mary!" 

"Yes, darling? What is it? I'm 
so tired." 

"Listen, Mary, you've got to 
crawl out of here. If you don't, 
the slugs will get us. Do you 
understand?" 

"All right, darling." Her eyes 
stayed open, but were vacant. I 
got her headed up the tube and 
came after her. I lifted and dragged her through the chamber of 
slugs and again through the control room, if that's what it was. 
When we came to where the tube 
was partly blocked by the dead 
elfin creature, she stopped ; I 
wormed past her and stuffed it 
into the branching tube. There 
was no doubt, this time, that its 
slug was dead. 

After an endless nightmare of 
leaden-limbed striving, we reached the outer door. The young officer was there and helped us lift 
her out, him pulling and the Old 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTI ©-N 



Man and me lifting and pushing. 
I gave the Old Man a leg up, 

jumped out myself, and took her 
away from the youngster. 

It was quite dark as we went 
back past the crushed house, 
avoiding the brake, and thence 
down to the road. Our car was no 
longer there. We were hurried into 
a "mud turtle" tank — none too 
soon, for the fighting was almost 
on top of us. The tank commander buttoned up and the craft 
lumbered into the water. 

Fifteen minutes later we were 
inside the Fulton, and an hour 
later we disembarked at the Mobile base. 

The Old Man and I had had 
coffee and sandwiches in the 
wardroom of the Fulton. Some of 
the Wave officers had cared for 
Mary in the women's quarters. 
She joined us as we left and 
seemed normal. 

I said, "Mary, are you all 
right?" 

She smiled. "Of course, darling. Why shouldn't I be?" 

A command ship and escort 
took us out of there. I had supposed that we were headed back 
to the Section offices, or to Washington. The pilot put us into a 
mountainside hangar in one of 
those egg-on-a-plate maneuvers 
that no civilian craft can accomplish — in the sky at high 
speed, then in a cave and stationary. 

THE PU»PET MASTERS 



"Where are we?" I asked. 

The Old Man did not answer. 

He got out; Mary and I followed. 
The hangar was small, just parking space for a dozen craft, an 
arresting platform, and a single 
launching rack. Guards directed 
us on back to a door set in living 
rock; we went through and found 
ourselves in an anteroom. A loudspeaker told us to strip. I hated 
to part with my gun and phone. 
We went in and were met by a 
young fellow whose clothing was 
an armband showing three chevrons and crossed retorts. He turned us over to a girl who was wearing less — only two chevrons. Both 
of them noticed Mary, each with 
typical response. I think the 
corporal was glad to pass us on to 
the female captain who received 
us. 

"We got your message," the 
captain said. "Dr. Steelton is 
waiting." 

"Thank you, ma'am," the Old 
Man answered. "Where?" 

"Just a moment," she said, 
went to Mary and felt through 
her hair. "We have to be sure," 
she s#id apologetically. If she was 
aware of the falseness of much 
of Mary's hair, she did not mention it. "All right," she decided, 
"let's go." Her own hair was cut 
mannishly short. 

"Right," agreed the Old Man, 
"No, son, this is as far as you go." 

"Why?" I asked. 

1» 



"Because you damn near loused 
up the first try." » 

The captain said, "The officers* 
mess is down the first passageway 
to the left. Why not wait there?" 

So I did. I passed a door 
decorated primly in red skull and 
crossbones and stenciled with: 

WARNING 
LIVE PARASITES BEYOND THIS DOOR 

Qualified Personnel Only 
Use Procedure A 

I gave it a wide berth. 

The officers' mess had three or 
four men and two women lounging in it. I found an unoccupied 
chair, sat down and wondered 
who you had to be to get a drink 
around there. After a time I was 
joined by a large male extrovert 
Wearing a colonel's insignia on a 
neck chain. 

"Newcomer?" he asked. I admitted it. "Civilian expert?" he 
went on. 

"I don't know about 'expert'," 
I replied. "I'm a field operative." 

"Name? Sorry to be officious,** 
he apologized, "but I'm the security officer around here. My 
name's Kelly." 

I told him mine. He nodded. 
"Matter of fact I saw you coming 
in. Now, Mr. Nivens, how about 
a drink?" 

I stood up. "Whom do I have 
to kill to get it?** 



"AS far as I can see,*' Kelly 
went on later, "this place 
needs a security officer the way a 
horse needs rollerskates. We 
should publish our results as fast 
as we get them." 

I commented that he did not 
sound like a brass hat. He laughed. "Believe me, son. not all brass 
hats are as they are pictured. 
They just seem to be." 

I remarked that Air Marshal 
Rexton struck me as a pretty 
sharp citizen. 

"You know him?" the colonel 
asked. 

"Not exactly, but my work has 
thrown me in his company a bit. 
I last saw him earlier today." 

"Hmm," said the colonel. "I've 
never met the gentleman. You 
move in more rarefied strata than 
I do, sir." 

1 explained that it was mere 
happenstance, but from then on 
he showed me more respect. Presently he was telling me about the 
work the laboratory did. 

"By now we know more about 
those foul creatures than does Old 
Nick himself. But do we know 
how to kill them without killing 
their hosts? We do not. I'm no 
scientist-— just a cop under a different tag— but I've talked to the 
scientists here. This is a biological 
war. We need a bug, one that will 
bite the slug and not the host. 
Doesn't sound too hard, does it? 
We know a hundred things that 



130 



GALAXY SCIENCi FICTION 



will kill the slug — smallpox, typhus, syphilis, encephalitis lethargies, Gbermayer's virus, 
plague, yellow fever, and so on. 
But they all kill the host, too." 

"Couldn't we use something 
that everyone is immune to?" I 
asked. "Everybody has typhoid 
shots. And almost everybody is 
vaccinated for smallpox." 

"No good. If the host is immune, the parasite doesn't get exposed to it. Now that the slugs 
have developed this outer cuticle, 
the parasite's environment is the 
host. No, we need something the 
host will catch and that will kill 
the slug, but won't give the host 
more than a mild fever." 

I started to answer when I saw 
the Old Man in the doorway. I 
excused myself and went to him. 
"What was Kelly grilling you 
about?" he asked. 

"He wasn't grilling me," I answered. 

"That's what you think. You 
know which Kelly that is? B. J. 
Kelly, the greatest scientific criminologist of our generation." 

"That Kelly! But he's not in 
the army." 

"Reserve, probably. But you 
can guess how important this lab 
is. Come on." 

"Where's Mary?" 

"You can't see her now. She's 
recuperating." 

"Is she — hurt?" 

"I promised you she would not 



be. Steelton is the best in his line. 
But we had to go down deep, 
against great resistance. That** 
always rough on the subject." 

"Did you get what you were 

after?" 

"Yes and no. We aren't 
through." 

"What were you after?" 

We had been walking along one 
of the place's endless underground passageways. Now he 
turned us into a small office, sat 
down, touched the desk communicator and said, "Private 
conference." 

"Yes. sir," a voice answered. 
"We wilt not record." A green 
light came on in the ceiling. 

"Not that I believe them," the 
Old Man complained, "but it 
may keep anyone but Kelly from 
playing it back. Well, I'll tell you 
a bit and answer your questions — 
some of them — in exchange for 
a solemn promise never to bother 
your wife with it. You don't have 
the skill to keep her from going 
into a wingding." 

"Very well, sir. I promise." 

"There were a group of people, 
a cult you might call them, that 
got into disrepute." 

"I know. The Whitmanites." 

"Eh? How did you know? 
From Mary? No, she couldn't 
have; she didn't know herself." 

"Not from Mary. I figured it 
out." 

He looked at me with odd re

spect. "Maybe I've underestimated you, son. As you say, the 
Whitmanites. Mary was one, as a 
kid in Antarctica." 

"Wait a minute!" I said. "They 
left Antarctica in 1974." 

"Right." 

"But that would make Mary 
around forty years old!" 

"Do you care?" 

"Of course not, only she can't 
be." 

"She is and she isn't. Chronologically, her age is about forty. 
Biologically, she is in her middle 
twenties. Subjectively, she is even 
younger, because she doesn't consciously remember anything earlier than about 1990." 

"What do you mean? That she 
doesn't remember, I can understand — she never wants to remember. But what do you mean 
by the rest?" 

"What I said. She is no older 
than she is because— You know 
that room where she started to 
remember? She spent ten years 
or more H in suspended animation 
in just such a tank as that." 

*XVIII 

AS I get older, I don't get 
tougher: I get softer. The 
thought of my beloved Mary 
swimming in that artificial womb, 
neither dead nor alive, preserved 
like a pickled grasshopper, was 
too much for me. 



I heard the Old Man saying, 
"Take it easy, son. She's all 
right." 

I said, "Go ahead." 

Mary's overt history was simple, though mystifying. She had 
been found in the swamps near 
Kaiserville at the north pole of 
Venus — a little girl who could 
give no account of herself and 
who knew only her name, Allucquere. Nobody spotted the significance of the name, and a child 
of her apparent age could not be 
associated with the Whitmanite 
debacle in any case; the 1980 supply ship had not been able to find 
any survivor of their "New Zion" 
colony. Ten years of time and 
more than two hundred miles of 
jungle separated the little waif of 
Kaiserville from the God-struck 
colonists of New Zion. 

In 1990 an unaccounted-for 
Earth child on Venus was incredible, but there was no one 
around with the intellectual curiosity to push the matter. Kaiserville was made up of miners, doxies, company representatives of 
Two Planets Corporation, and 
nothing else. Shoveling radioactive mud in the swamps would 
not leave much energy for wonder. 

She grew up using poker chips 
for toys and calling every woman 
in crib row "mother" or "auntie.** 
They shortened her name to 
"Lucky." The Old Man did not 



132 




 



say who paid her way back to 
Earth; the real questions were 
where she had been from the time 
New Zion was eaten up by the 
jungle, and just what had happened to the colony. 

But the only record was buried 
in Mary's mind, locked tight in 
terror and despair. 

SOMETIME before 1980 — 
^ about the time of the Flying 
Saucer reports from Russo -Siberia — the titans had discovered 
New Zion colony. If you place it 
one Saturn year earlier than the 
invasion of Earth, the chronology 
fits fairly well. The titans probably were not looking for Earthmen on Venus; more likely they 
were scouting Venus as they had 
long scouted Earth. Or they may 
have known where to look. We 
know that they kidnapped Earthmen over the course of two or 
more centuries; they may have 
captured someone whose brain 
could tell them where to find New 
Zion. Mary's dark memories 
could contain no clue to that. 

Mary saw the colony captured, 
saw her parents turned into zombies who no longer cared for her. 
Apparently she herself was not 
possessed, or she may have been 
possessed and turned loose. the 
ti tans finding a weak and ignorant young girl an unsuitable 
slave. In any case, for what was 
to her baby mind an endless time, 



she hung around, unwanted, un
cared for, but unmolested, scavenging like a mouse. 

The slugs were moving in to 
stay; their principal slaves were 
Venerians and the colonists were 
only incidental. It is sure that 
Mary saw her parents being 
placed in suspended animation. 
For later use in the invasion of 
Earth? Possible. 

In due course she herself was 
placed in the tanks. Inside a titan 
ship? At a base on Venus? More 
probably the latter, for when she 
woke , she w as still on Venus. 
There are many gaps. Were the 
slugs that rode the Venerians 
identical with the slugs which 
rode the colonists? The slugs 
seem endlessly adaptable, but 
they have to adapt themselves to 
the biochemistry of their hosts. 
Had Venus an oxy-silicon econ-« 
omy like Mars, or a fluorine economy, the same parasite type could 
not have fed on both Venerians 
and Earth men. 

But the gist of the matter lay 
in the situation as it was when 
Mary was removed from the artificial incubator. The titan inva* 
sion of Venus had failed, or was 
failing. She was possessed as soon 
as they removed her from the 
tank — but Mary had outlived the 
slug that possessed her. 

Why had the slugs died? Why 
had the invasion of Venus failed? 
It was for clues to these that the 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



131 



Old Man and Dr. Steelton had 
gone fishing in Mary's brain. 

1SAID, "Is that all?" 
"Isn't that enough?" 
"But it raises as many questions as it answers/' I complained, 
"There is a great deal more," he 
told me, "only you aren't a Venerian expert or a psychologist. 
I've told you what I have so that 
you will know why we have to 
work on Mary and won't question her about it. Be good to her, 
boy. She's had more than her 
share of grief." 

I ignored the advice; I can get 
along or not get along with my 
own wife without help, "What I 
can't see is why you had Mary 
linked up with Flying Saucers in 
the first place. I realize now that 
you took her along on that first 
trip on purpose. You were right — 
but why? And don't give me any 
malarkey." 

The Old Man looked puzzled. 
"Son, what is a 'hunch'?" 

"A belief that something is so, 
or isn't so, without evidence." 

"I'd call a hunch the result of 
unconscious reasoning on data 
you did not know you possessed." 

"Don't tell me your unconscious mind works on data you 
are going to get, but don't have." 

"Ah, but I did have data. 
What's the last thing that happeng^feo a candidate before he is 
certified as an agent?" 

134 



"The personal interview with 
you." 

"No, no!" 

"Oh, the trance analysis." I had 
forgotten hypnoanalysis for the 
simple reason that the subject 
never remembers it. "You mean 
you had this data on Mary then. 
It wasn't a hunch at all." 

"No again. I had a very little 
of it — Mary's defenses are strong. 
But I knew that Mary was the 
agent for this job. Later I played 
back her hypno interview; then I 
knew that there must be more. 
We tried for it and did not get it. 
But I knew that there had to be 
more." 

I thought it over. "You sure 
put her over the bumps to get it." 

"I had to. I'm sorry." 

"Okay, okay." I waited a moftient, then said, "Look, what was 
there in my hypno record?'* 

"I had my deputy play it. He 
said there wasn't anything I needed to know, so I never played it." 

"Well— thanks." 

He merely grunted. 

XXIX 

rj^HE slugs had died from something they contracted on Venus; that much we thought we 
knew. We weren't likely to get 
another chance in a hurry to collect direct information, for a despatch came in while the Old Man 
and I were talking, saying that 

5ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



the Pass Christian Saucer had 
been bombed to keep it from being recaptured. The Old Man had 
hoped to get at those human 
prisoners in that ship, revive and 
question them. 

That chance was gone. What 
they could dig out of Mary had 
better be the answer. If some infection peculiar to Venus was 
fatal to slugs but not fatal to 
humans — at least, Mary had 
lived through it — then the next 
step was to test them all and determine which one. Just dandy! 
The list of diseases native to 
Venus which are not fatal but 
merely nastily annoying is very 
long — from the standpoint of a 
Venerian bug. we must be too 
strange a diet. 

The problem was made harder 
by the fact that diseases native 
to Venus which were represented 
by cultures on Earth were strictly 
limited in number. Such an omission could be repaired — in a century or so of exploration and research on a strange planet. 

In the meantime, there was a 
breath of frost in the air; Schedule 
Suntan could not go on forever. 

The psych boys had to go back 
where they hoped the answer was, 
in Mary's brain. I did not like it, 
but I could not stop it. She did 
not appear to know why she was 
being asked to submit, over and 
over again, to hypnotics. Though 
she seemed serene, the strain 



showed — circles under her eyes, 
tremor, inattentiveness. Finally I 
told the Old Man that it had to 
stop. 

"You know better than that, 
son," he said. 

"The hell I do! If you haven't 
gotten what you want by now, 
you'll never get it." 

"If we don't succeed," he answered gently, "you'll wish to 
heaven that she had. Or do you 
want to raise kids to be hosts to 
titans?" 

I chewed my lip. "Why didn't 
you send me to Russia, instead of 
keeping me here?" 

"Oh, that — I want you here, 
with Mary, keeping her morale 
up, instead of acting like a spoiled 
brat. In the second place, it isn't 
necessary." 

"Huh? What happened? Some 
other agent report in?" 

"If you would ever show a 
grown-up interest in the news, 
you would know." 

I hurried out and brought myself up to date. This time I had 
managed to miss the first news of 
the only continentwide epidemic 
of Black Death since the 17th 
Century. 

I could not understand it. Russian public health measures were 
fairly good; they were carried out 
"by the numbers" and no nonsense tolerated. A country has to 
be literally lousy to * Spread 
plagues — rats, lice, and fleas, the 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



historical vectors. The Russian 
bureaucrats had even cleaned up 
China to the point where bubonic 
plague and typhus were localized. 

Now both plagues were spreading across the whole Sino-RussoSiberian axis, to the point where 
the government had broken down 
and pleas were being sent out for 
V. N. help. What had happened? 

I put the pieces together and 
looked up the Old Man again. 
'"Boss, there were slugs in Russia." 

"Yes." 

"You know? Well, for cripes 
sake, we'd better move fast, or 
the whole Mississippi Valley will 
be in the shape that Asia is in. 
Just one little rat — " The titans 
did not bother about human sanitation. I doubted if there had 
been a bath taken between the 
Canadian border and New Orleans since the slugs dropped the 
masquerade. Lice, fleas — 

The Old Man sighed. ''Maybe 
that's the solution.** 

"You might as well bomb them, 
if that's the best we have to offer. 
It's a cleaner way to die." 

"So it is. But you know we 
won't. As long as there is a chance 
we'll keep on trying." 

I mulled it over at length. We 
were in still another race against 
time. Fundamentally, the slugs 
must be too stupid to keep slaves; 
perhaps that was why they moved 
from planet to planet — they 



spoiled what they touched. After 
a while their hosts would die and 
then they needed new hosts. 

Theory, just theory. One thing 
was sure : Zone Red would be 
plague-ridden unless we found a 
way to kill the slugs, and that 
mighty soon! I made up my mind 
to do something I had considered 
before — force myself into the 
mind -searching sessions. If there 
were something in Mary's hidden 
memories which could be used to 
kill slugs, I might see it where 
others had failed. In any case I 
was going in, whether Steelton 
and the Old Man liked it or not. 
I was tired of being treated like 
a cross between a prince consort 
and an unwelcome child. 

XXX 

MARY and I had been living 
in a cubicle intended for one 
officer; we were as crowded as 
a plate of smorgasbord, but wc 
did not care. I woke up first the 
next morning and made my usual 
quick check to be sure that a slug 
had not gotten to her. While I 
was doing so, she opened her 
eyes and smiled drowsily. 
"Go back to sleep," I said. 
"I'm awake now." 
"Mary, do you know the incubation period for bubonic 
plague?*' 

She answered, "Should I know? 
Why, one of your eyes is slightly 



13* 




 



darker than the other. I never 
noticed before." 

I shook her. "Pay attention, 
wench. I was in the lab library 
last night, doing some figuring. 
As I get it, the slugs must have 
moved in on the Russians at least 
three months before they invaded 
us." 

"Yes, of course." 

"You know? Why didn't -you 
lay so?" 

"Nobody asked me." 

"Oh, for heaven's sake! Let's 
get up; I'm hungry." Before we 
left, I said, "Guessing games at 
the usual time?" 

"Yes." 

"Mary, you never talk about 
..ftp what they ask you." 

She looked surprised. "But I 
never know." 

"That's what I gathered. Deep 
trance with a 'forgetter' order, 
eh?" 

"I suppose so." 

"Hmm. Well, there'll be some 
Changes made. Today I am going 
with you." 

All she said was, "Yes, dear." 

They were gathered as usual 
in Dr. Steelton's office, the Old 
Man, Steelton himself, a Colonel 
Gibsy who was chief of staff, a 
lieutenant colonel, and an odd lot 
of sergeant-technicians, J.O.s and 
flunkies. In the army it takes an 
* eight-man working party to help 
a brasshat blow his nose. The 
Old Man's eyebrows shot up 



when he saw mc, but he said 

nothing. 

A sergeant tried to stop me. 
"Good morning, Mrs. Nivens," h( 
said to Mary, then told me, "1 
don't have you on the list." 

"I'm putting myself on thr 
list," I announced, and pushed or 
past him. 

Colonel Gibsy glared and 
turned to the Old Man with 
a "Hrrumph - what's - all - this?' 
noise. The rest looked frozenfaced, except one Wac sergeant 
who could not keep from grinning. 

The Old Man said to Gibsy. 
"Just a moment, Colonel," and 
limped over to me. In a voice 
that reached me alone, he said. 
"Son, you promised me." 

"And I withdraw it. You had 
no business exacting a promis* 
like that." 

"YouVe no business here, son. 
You are not skilled in these matters. For Mary's sake, get out." 

"You are the one with no business here. You are not an analyst. 
You get out." 

The Old Man glanced at Mary 
Nothing showed in her face. Th( 
Old Man said slowly, "You been 
eating raw meat, son?" 

I answered, "It's my wife who 
is being experimented on. From 
here on, I make the rules." 

Colonel Gibsy butted in. 
"Young man, art you out of your 
mind?"

I glanced at his hands. "That's 
a V.M.I, ring, isn't it? Have you 
any other qualifications? Are you 
an M. D.? A psychologist?" 

He drew himself up. "You seem 
to forget that this is a military 
reservation." 

"You forget that my wife and 
I aren't military personnel!" I 
added, "Come, Mary. We're 
leaving." 

"Yes, Sam." 

I said to the Old Man, 'Til 
tell the offices where to send our 
mail." I started for the door with 
Mary following. 

The Old Man said. "Just a moment." I stopped and he asked 
Gibsy, "Colonel, will you step 
outside with me? I'd like a word 
in private." 

Colonel Gibsy - gave me a general-court-martial look, but he 
went. We all waited. The juniors 
continued to be poker-faced, the 
lieutenant colonel looked perturbed, and the Wac sergeant 
seemed about to burst. Steelton 
was the only one who appeared 
unconcerned. He took papers out 
of li is "incoming" basket and 
went quietly to work. 

Ten or fifteen minutes later a 
sergeant came in. "Dr. Steelton, 
the Commanding Officer says to 
go ahead." 

"Very well, Sergeant," he acknowledged, then looked at me and 
said, "Let's go into the operating 
room." 



I said, "Not so fast. Who are 
these others? How about him?" 
I indicated the lieutenant colonel. 

"Eh? He's Dr. Hazelhurst. Two 
years on Venus." 

"Okay, he stays." I caught the 
eye of the sergeant with the grin 
and said, "What's your job, sister?" 

'Tm sort of chaperone." 

"I'm taking over the chaperone 
business. Now, Doctor, suppose 
you sort out the spare wheels 
from the people you actually 
need." 

"Certainly, sir.** It turned out 
that he really wanted no one but 
Colonel Hazelhurst. We went inside — Mary, myself, and the two 
specialists. 

The operating room contained 
a psychiatrist's couch surrounded 
by chairs. The double snout of a 
tri -dimension at camera poked out 
of the overhead. Mary went to 
the couch and lay down. 

Dr. Steelton got out an injector. "We'll try to pick up 
where we left off, Mrs. Nivens." 

I said, "Just a moment. You 
have records of the earlier attempts?'* 

"Of course." 

"Let's play them over first. I 
want to come up to date." 

He hesitated, then answered, 
"If you wish. Mrs. Nivens, I 
suggest that you wait in my 
office." 

It was probably the contrary 




 



mood that I was in; bucking the 
Old Man had gotten me hiked 
Up. 

"Let's find out first if she wants 
to leave." 

Steelton looked surprised. "You 
don't know what you are suggesting. These records would be emotionally disturbing to your wife." 

"Very questionable therapy," 
Hazel hurst put in. 

I said, "This isn't therapy and 
you know it. If therapy had been 
your object, you would have used 
eidetic recall techniques instead 
of drugs." 

"There was no time. We had 
to use rough methods for quick 
results. I'm not sure that I can 
authorize the subject to see the 
records." 

; I exploded. "Damn it, nobody 
asked you and you haven't got 
any authority in the matter. 
Those records were snitched out 
of my wife's head and they belong to her. She'll make up her 
own mind. Now ask her!" 

Steelton said, "Mrs. Nivens, do 
you wish to see your records?" 

Mary answered, "Yes, Doctor, 
I'd like to very much." 

He seemed astonished. "Do you 
wish to see them by yourself?" 

"With my husband. You and 
Dr. Hazelhurst are welcome to 
remain." 

They did. A stack of tape 
spools were brought in, each labeled with attributed dates and 



ages. It would have taken hours 
to go through them all, so I discarded those which concerned 
Mary's life after 1991; they could 
hardly affect the problem. 

We began with her very early, 
life. Each record started with, 
the subject, Mary, choking and 
groaning and struggling the way 
people always do when they are 
being forced back on a memory 
track which they would rather 
not follow. Then would come the 
reconstruction, both in her voice 
and in others. What surprised me 
most was Mary's face— in the 
tank, I mean. We had the magnification stepped up so that the 
stereo image was practically in 
our laps and one could follow 
every expression. 

First her face became that of 
a little girl — oh, her features were 
the same grown-up ones, but I 
knew that I was seeing my darling as she must have been when 
she was very small. It made me 
hope that we would have a little 
girl ourselves. 

Then her expression would 
change to match when other actors out of her memory took over. 
It was like watching an Incredibly 
able monologist playing many 
parts. 

Mary took it calmly, but her 
hand stole into mine. When we 
came to the terrible part where 
her parents changed, became 
slaves of slugs, she clamped down 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



139 



hard on my fingers. But she controlled herself. 

I skipped over the spools 
marked "period of suspended animation" and proceeded to the 
group concerned with the time 
from her resuscitation to the 
group concerned with her rescue 
from the swamps. 

One thing was certain: she had 
been possessed by a slug as soon 
as she was revived. The dead expression was that of a slug not 
bothering to keep up a masquerade ; the stereocasts from 
Zone Red were full of that look. 
The barrenness of her memories 
from that period confirmed it. 

Then, rather suddenly, she was 
no longer hag-ridden, but was 
again a little girl, very sick and 
f ri ghtened. There wa s a delirious quality to her remembered 
thoughts, until, at the last, a new 
voice came out loud and clear: 
"Welt, skin me alive ! Look, Pete, 
it's a little girl!" 

That tape carried on into 
Kaiserville, her recovery from 
starvation and exposure, and 
many new voices and memories; 
presently it ended. 

"I suggest," Dr. Steel ton said 
- as he took the tape out of the 
projector, "that we play another 
of the same period. They are all 
slightly different and this period 
is the key to the whole matter." 

"Why, Doctor?'* Mary asked. 

"If we could tell what killed 



the titan which, uh, possessed 
you before you were found — what 
killed it and left you alive — we 
might have the weapon we need." 

"But don't you know?" Mary 
asked wonderingly. 

"Not yet, but we'll get it. The 
human memory is an amazingly 
complete record." 

"I. thought you knew. It was 
nine-day fever." 

" What?" Hazelhurst bounced 
out of his chair. 

"Couldn't you tell from my 
face? It was characteristic — the 
mask, I mean, f used to nurse 
it back ho — back in Kaiserville, 
because I had had it once and 
was immune." 

Steelton said, "How about it. 
Doctor? Have you ever seen a 
case of it?" 

"By the time of the second expedition, they had the vaccine. 
I'm acquainted with its clinical 
characteristics, however." 

"But can't you tell from this 
record ?" 

"Well," Hazelhurst answered 
carefully, "I would say that what 
we have seen is consistent with 
it, but not conclusive." 

"What's not conclusive?" Mary 
said sharply. "I told you it was 
nine -day fever." 

"We must be sure," Steelton 
said apologetically. 

"How sure can you get? There 
is no question about it. I wai 
told that I had been sick with

it when Pete and Frisco found 
me. I nursed other cases later 
end I never caught it. I remember 
their faces when they were ready 
to die — just like my own face 
in the record. Anyone who has 
ever seen a case could not possibly mistake it for anything else. 
What more do you want?" 

I have never seen Mary so close 
to losing her temper — except once. 
I said to myself: look out, gentlemen, better duck! 

Steelton said, "I think you 
have proved your point, but tell 
me: You were believed to have 
no conscious memory of this 
period and my own examination 
of you confirmed it. Now you 
speak as if you had.'* 

Mary looked puzzled. "I remember it now, quite clearly. I 
haven't thought about it in many 
years." 

"I think I understand." He 
turned to Hazelhurst. "Well, Doctor, do we have a culture of the 
disease? Have your boys done 
any work on it?" 

Hazelhurst seemed stunned. 
"Work on it? Of course not! It's 
out of the question — nine-day 
fever! We might as well use polio 
or typhus. I'd rather treat a hangnail with an ax!" 

I touched Mary's arm. "Let's 
go, darling. I think we have done 
all the damage we can." She was 
trembling and her eyes were full 
of tears. I took her into the mess


room for systemic treatmentdistilled. 

A FTER bedding Mary down 
for a nap, I looked up my 
father in the office they had assigned him. 

He looked at me speculatively. 
"Well, Elihu, I hear you hit the 
jackpot." 

"I prefer to be called Sam," I 
answered. 

"Very well, Sam. Success is its 
own excuse; nevertheless, the 
jackpot appears to be disappointingly small. Nine-day fever — no 
wonder the colony died out and 
the slugs as well. I don't see how 
we can use it. We can't expect 
everyone to have Mary's remarkable resistance." 

He was right, of course. The 
fever carried a 98%-plus death 
rate among unprotected Earthmen, With those who had taken 
the shots, the rate was an effective 
zero — but that would be true of 
the slugs, too. 

"I can't see that it matters," I 
pointed out. "It's odds-on that 
you will have typhus or plague 
— or both — throughout the Mississippi Valley in the next six 
weeks." 

"Or the slugs may have learned 
a lesson in Asia and will start 
taking drastic sanitary measures." 
The idea startled me so that I 
almost missed the next thing he 
said, which was: "No, Sam, you'll

liavc to devise a better plan.** _ 
"/'// have to? I just work here.** 
"You did once. Now you've 
taken charge of this job." 

"What the devil are you talking about? I'm not in charge of 
anything and don't want to be. 
You are the boss." 

He shook his head. "A boss 
is the man who does the bossing. 
Titles and insignia come later. 
Tell me, do you think Oldfield 
could ever replace me?" 

I shook my head; Dad's chief 
deputy was the executive officer 
type, a "carry-outer," not a 
4 think-upper." "I've never promoted you," he went on, "because 
I knew that when the time came 
you would promote yourself. Now 
you've done it — by bucking my 
judgment, forcing your own on 
me, and by being right." 

"Rats! I got bull-headed and 
forced one issue. It never occurred to you big brains that you 
weren't consulting the one real 
Venus expert you had on tap — 
Mary. But I didn't expect to find 
out anything ; I had a lucky 
break." 

He shook his head. "Luck is a 
tag given by the mediocre to 
excuse for their mediocrity." 

I placed my hands on the desk 
and leaned toward him. "Okay, 
so I'm a genius — but you are not 
going to make me hold the sack. 
When this is over, Mary and I are 
going up in the mountains and 



raise kittens and kids, I don't intend to boss screwball agents." 

He smiled gently and didn't 
answer. 

"I don't want your job. Understand me?" 

"Don't take it so hard, Sam. 
I'll keep the title for the present. 
In the meantime, what are your 
plans — sir?" 

XXXI 

THE worst of it was that he 
meant it. I tried to go limp 
on him, but it didn't work. A toplevel conference was called that 
afternoon; I was notified, but 
stayed away. Shortly a polite little Wac came to tell me that 
the commanding officer was waiting and would I please come at 
once? 

So I went — and tried to stay 
out of the discussion. But my 
father has a way of conducting 
a meeting, even if he is not in 
the chair, by looking expectantly 
at the one he wants to hear from. 
It's a subtle trick; the group does 
not know that it is being led. 

But / knew. With every eye in 
the room on you, it is easier to 
voice an opinion than to keep 
quiet. Particularly when I found 
that I had opinions. 

There was much moaning and 
groaning about the impossibility 
of using nine-day fever. Admitted 
that it would kill slugs, but it 



142 




 



would even kill Venetians who 
can be chopped in two and survive, and it was sure death to 
almost any human. Seven to ten 
days after exposure — curtains. 

"Yes, Mr. Nivens?" It was the 
commanding general, addressing 
me. I hadn't said anything, but 
Dad*s eyes were on me, waiting. 

"I think there has been a lot 
of despair voiced at this session," 
I said, "and a lot of opinions 
given that were based on assumptions. The assumptions may not 
be correct." 

"How so?" • 

I did not have an instance in 
mind; I had been shooting from 
the hip. "Well, I hear constant 
reference to nine-day fever as if 
the nine-day part were an absolute fact. It's not." 

The boss brass shrugged impatiently. "It's a convenient tag. 
It averages nine days." 

"Yes, but how do you know 
it lasts nine days — for a stag?" 

By the murmur with which it 
was received, I knew that I had 
hit the jackpot again. 

I was invited to explain why I 
thought the fever might run a 
different time in slugs and why it 
mattered. I bulled on ahead. 

"In the only case we knew 
about, the slug did die in less 
than nine days — a lot less. Those 
of ycu who have seen the records 
on my wife — and I gather that 
entirely too many of you have — 



are aware that her parasite left 
her, presumably dropped off and 
died, long before the eighth -day 
crisis. If experiments confirm this, 
then the problem is different. A 
man infected with the fever might 
be rid of his slug in— oh, call it 
four days. That gives you five 
days to catch and cure him." 

The general whistled silently. 
"That's a pretty heroic solution, 
Mr. Nivens. How do you propose 
to cure him? Or even catch him? 
I mean to say, suppose we plant 
an epidemic in Zone Red. it 
would take incredibly fast footwork — in the face of stubborn 
resistance, remember — to locate 
and treat more than fifty million 
people before they died." 

I slung the hot potato right 
back, wondering how many "experts" had made their names by 
passing the buck. "The second 
question is a logistical and tactical problem — your problem. As 
to the first, there is your expert." 
1 pointed to Dr. Hazelhurst. 

Hazelhurst huffed and puffed 
and I knew how he felt. More research needed . . . experiments 
would be required . . . work had 
been done toward an antitoxin, 
but the vaccine for immunizing 
had proven so successful that he 
was not sure the antitoxin had 
ever been perfected. He concluded 
lamely by saying that the utudy 
of the exotic diseases of Venus 
was still in its infancy. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



•«3 



The general interrupted him. 
"This antitoxin business — how 
soon can you find out about it?" 

Hazelhurst said that there was 
a man at the Sorbonne he wanted 
to phone. 

"Do so," his commanding officer said. "You are excused." 

TTAZELHURST came buzzing 
at our door before breakfast 
the next morning. I stepped out 
into the passage to see him. 
"Sorry to wake you/' he said, 
"but you were right about that 
antitoxin matter." 
"I was?" 

"They are sending me some 
from Paris; it should arrive any 
minute. I do hope it's still potent." 

"And if it isn't?" 

"Well, we have the means to 
make it. We'll have to, of course, 
if this wild scheme is used — millions of units of it." 

"Thanks for telling me," I said. 
I started to turn away; he stopped me. 

"Uh, Mr. Nivens, about the 
matter of vectors — ** 

"Vectors?" 

"Disease vectors. We can't use 
rats or mice or anything like that. 
Do you know how the fever is 
transmitted on Venus? By a little 
flying rotifer, the Venerian equivalent of an insect. But we don't 
have any and that is the only 
Way it can be carried." 



"Do you mean to say you 
couldn ' t gi ve it to me if you 
tried?" 

"Oh, yes, I could inject you. 
But I can't picture a million paratroopers dropping into Zone Red 
and asking the parasite-ridden 
population to hold still while they 
gave them injections." 

Something started turning over 
slowly in my brain ... a million 
men in a single drop. "Why ask 
me?" I said. "It's a medical problem." 

"Of course. I just thought — 
Well, you seemed to have a ready 
grasp — " He paused. 

"Thanks." My mind was struggling with two problems at once 
and having traffic trouble. How 
many people were there in Zone 
Red? "Let me get this straight. 
Suppose you had the fever. I 
couldn't catch it from you?" The 
drop could not be medical men; 
there weren't that many. 

"Not easily. From a smear or 
a trace transfusion from my veins 
to yours." 

"Direct contact, eh?" How 
many people could one paratrooper service? Twenty? Thirty? 
More? "If that is what it takes, 
you don't have any problem." 

"I'm sorry. I don't — " 

"What's the first thing a slug 
does when he runs across another 
he hasn't seen lately" 

"Conjugation!* ' 

"Direct conference, I've always

called it, but I use the sloppy old 
slug language for it. Do you think 
that would pass on the disease?" 

"Think so? I'm sure of it! We 
have demonstrated, right in this 
laboratory, that there is exchange 
of living protein during conjugation. They could not possibly escape transmission; we can infect 
the whole colony as if it were one 
body. Now why didn't J think of 
that?" 

"Don't go off half-cocked," I 
warned. "But I suspect it will 
work." 

"It wilH It will!" He started to 
go, then stopped. "Oh, Mr. Nivens, would you mind very much 
—I know it's a lot to ask — " 

"What is? Speak up." I was 
anxious to work out the Test of 
the other problem, 

"Well, would you permit me 
to announce this method of vectoring? I'll give you full credit, 
but the general expects a lot and 
this is just what I need to make 
my report complete." He looked 
so anxious that I almost laughed. 

"Go ahead," I said. "It's your 
department." 

"That's decent of you. I'll try 
to return the favor." He went 
away happy and so was I ; I was 
beginning to like being a "genius." 

I stopped to straighten out in 
my mind the main features of the 
big drop. Then I went in. Mary 
opened her eyes and gave me 
that long heavenly smile. 



I reached down and smoothed 
her hair. "Howdy, flame top. Did 
you know that your husband is 
a genius?" 

"Of courst." 

"You did? You never said so." 
"You never asked me." 

TTAZELHURST referred to it 
as the "Nivens Vector." Then 
I was asked to comment, though 
Dad looked my way first. 

"I agree with Dr. Hazelhurst," 
I started out, "subject to experimental confirmation. However, he 
has left for discussion aspects 
which are tactical rather than 
medical. Important considerations of timing — crucial, I should 
say — " I had worked out my 
opening speech, even to the hesitations, while eating breakfast — 
"require vectoring from many focal points. If we are to save a 
nominal hundred per cent of the 
population of Zone Red, it is 
necessary that all parasites be 
infected at nearly the same time 
in order that rescue squads may 
enter after the slugs are no longer 
dangerous and before any host 
has passed the point where antitoxin can save him. 

"The problem is susceptil le, to 
mathematical analysis — " Sam, 
boy, I said to myself, you old 
phony, you could not solve it 
with an electronic integrator and 
twenty years of sweat — "and 
should be turned over to your 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



T45 



analytical section. However, let 
me sketch out the factors. Call 
the number of vector origins X; 
call the number of rescue workers 
Y. There will be an indefinitely 
large number of simultaneous 
solutions, with optimum solution 
depending on logistic factors. 

"Speaking in advance of rigorous mathematical treatment — " I 
had done my damnedest with a 
slipstick, but I did not mention 
that — "and basing my opinions 
on my own unfortunately toointimate knowledge of their habits. I would estimate — " 

You could have heard a pin 
drop, if anybody in that bareskinned crew had had a pin. The 
general interrupted once when I 
placed a low estimate on X, "Mr. 
Nivens, I think we can assure 
you of any number of volunteers 
for vectoring." 

1 shook my head. 
"You can't accept volunteers, 
General.** 

"I think I see your objection. 
The disease would have to be 
given time to establish in the 
volunteer and the timing might 
be dangerously close. But I think 
we could get around that — a gelatine capsule of antitoxin embedded in tissue, or something of the 
sort. I'm sure the staff could 
work it out." 

I thought they could, too, but 
my real objection was a deeprooted aversion to any human 



soul having to be possessed by 
a slug. "You must nor use human 
volunteers, General. The slug will 
know everything that his host 
knows and he simply will not go 
into direct conference; he'll warn 
the others by word of mouth instead. No, sir, we will use animals 
— apes, dogs, anything large 
enough to carry a slug, but incapable of speech, and in quantities large enough to infect the 
whole group before any slug 
knows that it is sick." 

I gave a fast sketch of the Anal 
drop, "Schedule Mercy/* as I 
saw it. "The first drop — 'Schedule Fever* — can start as soon as 
we have enough antitoxin for the 
second drop. Less than a week 
after, there should be no slug left 
alive on this continent." 

They did not applaud, but it 
felt that way. The General hurried away to call Air Marshall 
Rexton. then sent his aide back 
to invite me to lunch. I sent word 
that I would be pleased provided 
the invitation included my wife. 

Dad waited for me outside the 
conference room. "Well, how did 
I do?" I asked him, more anxiously than I tried to sound. 

He shook his head. "Sam, you 
wowed 'em. I think 1*11 sign 
you up for twenty-six weeks of 
stereo." 

I tried not to show how much 
I was pleased. I had gotten

rpHAT ape Satan which had 
-"- wrung my heart at the National Zoo turned out to be as 
mean as he was billed, once he 
was free of his slug. Dad had 
volunteered to be the test case 
for the Nivens-Hazelhurst theories, but I put my foot down 
and Satan drew the short straw. 
It was neither filial affection nor 
its neo-Freudian antithesis that 
caused me to balk him; I did not 
want him on their side even under 



laboratory conditions. Not with 1 
his shifty, tricky mind! People 
who have never experienced possession cannot appreciate that the 
host is utterly against us — with 
all his abilities intact. 

So we used apes for the experiments. We had on hand not 
only apes from the National 
Zoological Gardens, but simian 
citizens from half a dozen zooa 
and circuses. 

Satan was injected with nineday fever on Wednesday, the 
12th. By Friday the fever had 
established. Another chimp-cumslug was put in with him. The 
slugs immediately went into di

rcct conference, after which the 
second ape was removed. 

On Sunday, the 16th, Satan's 
master shriveled up and fell off. 
Satan was immediately injected 
with antitoxin. Late Monday the 
other slug died and its host was 
dosed. 

By Wednesday, the 19th, Satan 
was well, though a bit thin, and 
the second ape. Lord Fauntleroy, 
was recovering. I gave Satan a 
banana to celebrate with and he 
took off the first joint of my left 
index finger and me with no time 
for a repair job. 

But a minor injury could not 
depress me. After I had it dressed, 
I looked for Mary, failed to find 
her and ended up in the messroom, wanting someone with 
whom to share a toast. 

The place was empty. Everyone in the labs was working, 
mounting "Schedule Mercy." By 
order of the President, all possible 
preparations were confined to this 
one lab in the Smoky Mountains. 
The apes for vectoring, some two 
hundred of them, were here. The 
culture and antitoxin were being 
"cooked" here. The horses for 
serum were stalled in an underground handball court. 

The million - plus men for 
"Schedule Mercy" could not be 
here, but they would know nothing until alerted just before the 
drop, at which time each would 
be issued a hand gun and ban


doliers of individual antitoxin 
injectors. Those who were unwilling would be pushed, if necessary, 
by some sergeant with a large 
foot. Everything was being done 
to keep the secret close. The only 
way I could see that we could 
lose would be for the titans to 
find out our plans, through a 
renegade or some fool telling his 
wife. 
If we failed to keep this secret, 
our ape vectors would be shot on 
sight wherever they appeared in 
the titan nation. Nevertheless I 
relaxed over my drink, happy 
and reasonably sure that the secret would not leak. Traffic was 
"incoming only" until after Drop 
Day and Colonel Kelly censored 
or monitored all communication 
outward. 

As for a leak outside, the 
chances were slight. The General, 
Dad, Colonel Gibsy, and myself 
had gone to the White House the 
week before. There Dad put on 
an exhibition of belligerence and 
exasperation that got us what 
we wanted; in the end, even Secretary Martinez was kept in the 
dark. If the President and Rexton 
could keep from talking in their 
sleep for another week, I did not 
see how we could miss. 

A week would be none too 
soon : Zone Red was spreading. 
After the battle of Pass Christian, 
the slugs had pushed on and now

cola. There were signs of more 
to come. Perhaps the slugs were 
growing tired of our resistance 
and might decide to waste raw 
material by A-bombing the cities 
we still held. If so — well, a radar 
screen can alert your defenses, 
but it won't stop a determined 
attack. 

I refused to worry. One more 
week — 

i^OLONEL Kelly came in and 
^-*sat down beside me. "How 
about a drink?" I suggested. "I 
feel like celebrating." 

He examined the paunch bulging in front of him and said. "I 
suppose one more beer wouldn't 
put me in any worse shape." 

"Have two beers. Have a 
dozen." I dialed for him, and told 
him about the success of the experiments with the apes. 

He nodded. "Yes, I had heard. 
Sounds good." 

"Good, the man says! Colonel, 
we are on the one-yard line and 
goal to go. A week from now 
we'll have won." 

"Well?" 

"Then you'll be able to put 
your clothes back on and lead 
a normal life," I answered, irritated. "Or don't you think our 
plans will work?" 

"Yes, I think they will." 
. "Then why the crepe-hanging?" 

He said, "Mr. Nivens, you don't 



think that a man with my pot 
belly enjoys running around 
without his clothes, do you?" 

"I suppose not. As for myself 
1 may hate to give it up — saves 
time and it's a hell of a lot more 
comfortable." 

"Don't worry about it. This is 
a permanent change." 

"Huh? I don't get you. You 
said our plans would work and 
now you talk as if Schedule Suntan would go on forever." 

"In a modified way, it definitely 
will." 

I said, "Pardon me, I'm stupid 
today." 

He dialed for another beer. 
"Mr. Nivens, I never expected 
to see a military reservation 
turned into a ruddy nudist camp. 
Having seen it, I never expect 
to see us change back, because 
we can't. Pandora's box has a 
one-way lid. All the king's horses 
and all the king's men — " 

"Conceded," I said. "Things 
never go back quite to what they 
were before. But you are exaggerating. The day the President 
rescinds Schedule Suntan, the 
blue laws will go back into effect 
and a man without pants will be 
liable to arrest." 

"I hope not." 

"What? Make up your mind." 

" It's made up for me . Mr. 
Nivens, as long as there exists 
a possibility that a slug is alive, 
the polite man must be willing

to bare his body on request, or 
risk getting shot. Not just this 
week and next, but twenty years 
from now, or a hundred. No, no!" 
he added, "I am not disparaging 
your plans, but you have been 
too busy to notice that they are 
strictly local and temporary. For 
example, have you made any provision for combing the Amazonian jungles, tree by tree? This 
globe has nearly sixty million 
square miles of land; we can't 
begin to search it for slugs. Hell, 
we haven't even made a dent in 
rats and we've been at that a 
long time." 

■ "Are you trying to tell me it's 
hopeless?" I demanded. 

"Not at all. Have another 
drink. I'm trying to say that we 
are going to have to learn to live 
with this horror, the way we 
had to learn to live with the 
atom bomb." 

XXXIII 

"Vf 7"E were gathered in the same 
room in the White House; 
it put me in mind of the night 
after the President's message, 
many weeks before. Dad and 
Mary, Rexton and Martinez were 
there, as well as our own lab 
general, Dr. Hazelhurst, and 
Colonel Gibsy. Our eyes were on 
the big map still mounted across 
one Wall. It had been four and 
a half days since the drop of 



"Schedule Fever," but the Mississippi Valley still glowed with 
ruby lights. 

I was getting j ittery , even 
though the drop had been an 
apparent success and we had lost 
only three craft. According to the 
equations, every slug within 
reach of direct conference should 
have been infected three days 
ago, with an estimated twentythree per cent overlap. The 
operation had been computed to 
contact about eighty per cent in 
the first twelve houTs, mostly in 
cities. 

Soon, slugs should start dying 
a damn sight faster than flies 
ever did — it we were right. 

I tried to sit still while I wondered whether those ruby lights 
covered a few million very sick 
slugs, or merely two hundred 
dead apes. Had somebody skipped a decimal point? Or blabbed? 
Or had there been an error in 
our reasoning so colossal that 
we could not see it? 

Suddenly a light blinked green; 
everybody sat up. A voice began 
to come out of the stereo gear, 
though no picture built up. "This 
is Station Dixie, Little Rock T " 
a very tired Southern voice said. 
"We need help very badly. Anyone who is listening, please pass 
on this message : Little Rock, 
Arkansas, is in the grip of a 
terrible epidemic. Notify the Red 
Cross. We have been in the hands 



150 




 



of — " The voice trailed off, either 
from weakness or transmission 
failure. 

I remembered to breathe. Marypatted my hand and I sat back, 
relaxing consciously. It was joy 
too great to be pleasure. I saw 
now that the green light had not 
been Little Rock, but farther west 
in Oklahoma. Two more lights 
blinked green, one in Nebraska 
and one north of the Canadian 
line. Another voice came over, 
a twangy New England one. I 
wondered how he had gotten into 
Zone Red. 

"A little like election night, eh. 
Chief?" Martinez said heartily. 

"A little," the President agreed, 
"but we do not usually get returns from Old Mexico." He 
pointed to the board; green lights 
were showing in Chihuahua. 

"By George, you're right. Welt, 
I guess State will have some incidents to straighten out when 
this is over, eh?" 

The President did not answer 
and he shut up, to my relief. The 
President seemed to be talking 
to himself. He noticed me, smiled 
and spoke out loud: 

" *Tis said that fleas have little 
fleas, 

Upon their backs to bite 'em, 
And little fleas have lesser 
fleas. 

And so, ad infinitum.' " 
I smiled to be polite, though I 
thought the notion waa gruesome, 



under the circumstances. The 
President looked away and said, 
"Would anyone like supper? I 
find that I am hungry for the 
first time in days." 

T>Y late next afternoon, the 
board was more green than 
red. Rexton had had two annunciators keyed into the command 
center in the New Pentagon. One 
showed percentage of completion 
of the complicated score deemed 
necessary before the big drop; the 
other showed projected time of 
drop. The figures on it changed 
from time to time. For the past 
two hours they had been hovering 
around 17.43 East Coast time. 

Rexton got up. "I'm going to 
freeze it at seventeen -forty -five,'* 
he announced. "Mr. President, 
will you excuse me?" 

"Certainly, Marshal." 

Rexton turned to Dad and myself. "If you Don Quixotes want 
to drop in on Zone Red, now is 
the time/' 

I stood up. "Mary, you wait 
for me." 

She asked, "Where?" It had 
been settled — and not peacefully! 
— that she was not to go along. 

The President interrupted. "I 
suggest that Mrs. Nivens stay 
here. After all, she is a member 
of the family." 

I said, "Thank you, sir." 
Colonel Gibsy got a very odd 
look. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

Two hours later we were coming in on our target and the jump 
door was open. Dad and I were 
la-st in line, after the kids who 
would do the real work. My 
hands were sweaty with the old 
curtain-going-up tension. I was 
scared as hell — I never did like 
to jump. . 

XXXIV 

^^UN in my left hand, antitoxin 
hypo ready in my right, I 
went from door to door in my 
assigned block. It was an older 
section of Jefferson City, slums 
almost, consisting of apartment 
houses built fifty years ago. I 
had given two dozen injections 
and had three dozen to go before 
it would be time for me to rendezvous at the State House. I was 
getting sick of it. 

I knew why I had come — it 
was not just curiosity; 1 had to 
see the slugs die! But now I had 
seen them dead and I had had 
enough of it. 

I wanted to go home, take a 
bath, and forget it. 

It was not hard work, just 
monotonous and nauseating. So 
far I had not seen one live slug, 
though I had seen many dead 
ones. I had burned down one 
skulking dog that appeared to 
have a hump; I was not sure because the light had been bad. 
We had hit shortly before sun


down and now it was almost dark. 

I finished checking the apartment building I was in and went 
out into the street. It was almost 
deserted; with the whole population sick with the fever, we found 
few on the streets. The lone exception was a man who came 
weaving toward me, eyes vacant. 
I yelled, "Hey!" 

He stopped. I said, "I've got 
what you need to get well. Hold 
out your arm." 

He struck at me feebly. I hit 
him carefully and he went face 
down. Across his back was the 
red rash of the slug. I picked a 
reasonably clean and healthy 
patch over his kidney and stuck 
in the injector, bending it to break 
the point after it was in. The 
units were gas-loaded; nothing 
more was needed. 

The first floor of the next house 
held seven people, most of them 
so far gone that I did not speak 
but simply gave them their shots 
and hurried on. I had no trouble. 
The second floor was like the first. 

The top floor had three empty 
apartments, at one of which I had 
to burn out the lock to enter. 
The fourth flat was occupied, in 
a manner of speaking. There was 
a dead woman on the floor of the 
kitchen, her head bashed in. Her 
slug was still on her shoulders, 
but it was dead, too. I left them 
quickly and looked around. 
In the bathroom, sitting in an 



152 




 



old-fashioned tub, was a middleaged man. His head slumped on 
his chest and his wrist veins were 
open. I thought he was dead, but 
he looked up as I bent over him. 
"You're too late," he said dully. 
"I killed my wife." 

—or too soon, I thought. From 
the appearance of the bottom of 
the tub and his gray face, five 
minutes later would have been 
better. I looked at him, wondering whether or not to waste an 
injection. 

He spoke again. "My little 
girl—" 

His head slumped forward 
again. I felt his jaw line and dug 
my thumb into his neck, but 
could find no pulse. 

The child was in bed in one 
of the rooms, a girl of eight or 
so who would have been pretty 
had she been well. She roused 
and cried somewhat deliriously 
and called me Daddy. "Yes, yes," 
I said soothingly, "Daddy's going 
to take care of you." I gave her 
the injection in her leg; I don't 
think she noticed it. 

I turned to go, but she called 
out again. "I'm thirsty. Want a 
drink of water." So I had to go 
back into that' bathroom again. 

As I was giving it to her, my 
phone shrilled and I spilled some 
of the water. "Son! Can you hear 
me?" 

I reached for my belt and 



switched on my phone. "Yes. 
What's up?" 

"I'm in that little park just 
north of you. I'm in trouble." 

"Coming!" I put down the 
glass and started to leave — then, 
caught by indecision, I turned 
back. I could not leave the child 
to wake up with a parent dead 
in each room. I gathered her up 
and stumbled down to the second floor. I entered the first door 
I came to and laid her on a sofa. 
There were people in the flat, too 
sick to bother with her, but it 
was alt I could do. 

*'Hurry, son!" 

"On my way!" I dashed out 
and wasted no more breath talking, but made speed. Dad's assignment was directly north of 
mine, paralleling it and fronting 
on one of those pint-sized downtown parks. 

"Here, son, over here — at the 
car!" I could hear him both 
through the phone and by ear. I 
swung around and spotted the 
car, a big Cadillac duo much 
like those the Section often used. 
There was someone inside, but 
it was too dark for me to see. I 
approached cautiously until I 
heard him say, "Thank God! I 
thought you woiild never come," 
and knew that it was he. 

I had to duck to get in through 
the door. It was then that he 
clipped me. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



153 



W CAME to, to find my hands 

and ankles tied. I was in the 
second driver's seat of the car 
and the Old Man was in the 
other at the controls. The wheel 
on my side was latched up out 
of the way. The realization that 
the car was in the air brought 
me fully awake. 

He turned and said cheerfully, 
"Feeling better?" I could see his 
slug, riding high on his shoulders. 

"Some," I admitted. 

"Sorry 1 had to hit you," he 
went on, "but there was no other 
way." 

*'I supose not." 

"I'll have to leave you tied up 
for the present. Later on we can 
make better arrangements." He 
grinned, his old wicked grin. Most 
amazingly, his own personality 
Came through with every word 
the slug said. 

I did not ask what "better arrangements" were possible; I did 
not want to know. I concentrated 
on checking my bonds — but the 
Old Man had given them his 
personal attention. 

"Where are we going?" I asked. 

"South." He fiddled with the 
controls. "Way south. Give me a 
moment to lay this heap in the 
groove and I will explain what's 
'in rtore for us." He was busy for 
a few seconds, then said, "There, 
that will hold her until she levels 
off at thirty thousand." 

The mention of that much alti


tude caused me to look at the 
control board. The duo did not 
merely look like one of the Section's cars; it actually was one 
of our souped-up jobs. 

"Where did you get this car?" 
I asked. 

"The Section had it cached in 
Jefferson City. I looked and, sure 
enough, nobody had found it. 
Fortunate, wasn't it?" 

There could be a second opinion, I thought, but I did not argue. I was still checking the 
possibilities and finding them between slim and hopeless. My own 
gun was gone. He was probably 
carrying his on the side away 
from me; it was not in sight. 

"But that was not the best of 
it," he went on. "I had the good 
luck to be captured by what was 
almost certainly the only healthy 
master in the whole of Jefferson 
City — not that I believe in luck. 
So we win, after all." He chuckled. "It's like playing both sides 
of a very difficult chess game." 

"You didn't tell me where we 
are going," I persisted. I was getting nowhere fast and talking was 
the only action open to me. 

He considered. "Out of the 
United States, certainly. My master may be the only one free of 
nine-day fever in the whole continent and I don't dare take a 
chance. I think the Yucatan 
Peninsula would suit us. That's 
where I've got her pointed. We 



t54 




 



can hole up there and increase 
our numbers and work farther 
south. When we do come back — 
and we will!- — we won't make the 
same mistakes." 

I said, "Dad, can't you take 
these ropes off me? They cut my 
circulation. You know you can 
trust me." 

"Wait until we go full automatic." The car was still climbing. Souped up or not, thirty 
thousand was a long pull for a 
car that had started out as a 
family model. 

I sa id , " You see m to forget 
that I was with the masters a long 
time. I know the score and I give 
you my word of honor." 

He grinned. "Don't teach 
grandma how to steal sheep. If 
I let you loose now, you'll kill 
me or I'll have to kill you. And 
I want you alive. We're going 
places, son — you and me. We're 
fast and we're smart and we are 
just what the doctor ordered." 

I did not have an answer. He 
went on, "Just the same — about 
you knowing the score, why 
didn't you tell me, son? Why did 
you hold out on me?" 

"How?" 

"I had no idea that a man 
could feel such peace and contentment and well-being. This is 
the happiest I've been in years, 
the happiest since — " He looked 
puzzled — "since your mother 
died. But never mind that; this 



is better. You should have tolc 
me." 

Disgust suddenly poured over 
me. I forgot the cautious game I 
was playing. "Maybe I didn't see 
it that way. And neither would 
you, you old fool, if you didn't 
have a slug riding you. talking 
through your mouth, thinking 
with your brain!" 

"Take it easy, son," he said 
gently — and so help me. his voice 
did quiet me. "You'll know better soon. Believe me, this is what 
we were intended for. This is our 
destiny. Mankind has been divided, warring with himself. The 
masters will make him whole." 

I thought to myself that that 
was exactly what the slugs 
wanted humanity to do — surrender their souls willingly for a 
phony promise of security and 
peace. But I did not say so. 

"You need not wait much 
longer," he said suddenly, glancing at the board. "I'll nail her 
down in the groove." He adjusted 
his dead-reckoner bug, checked 
his board, and set his controls. 
"Next stop: Yucatan. Now to 
work." He got out of the chair 
and knelt beside me in the 
crowded space. "Got to be safe/' 
he added, as he strapped the 
safety belt across my middle. 

I brought my knees up in his 
face. 

He reared up and looked at 
me without anger. "Naughty, 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



155 



naughty. I could resent that, but 
the masters don't go in for resentment. Now be good."- He went 
ahead, checking my wrists and 
feet. His nose was bleeding, but 
he did not bother to wipe it. 
"You'll do," he said. "Be patient; 
it won't be long." 

He went back to the other control seat, sat down and leaned 
forward, elbows on knees. It 
brought his master directly into 
my view. 

Nothing happened for some 
minutes, nor could I think of anything to do but strain at my 
bonds. By his appearance, the 
Old Man was asleep, only he 
wasn't. I knew what was about 
to happen. 

A line formed straight down 
the middle of the horny brown 
covering of the slug. 

As I watched it, it widened. 
Presently I could see the opalescent horror underneath. The 
space between the two halves of 
the shell widened — the slug was 
fissioning, sucking life and nourishment out of the body of my 
father to make two of itself. 

I had no more than five minutes of independent life left to me. 

TTAD it been possible for flesh 
and bone to break the ties 
on me, I would have broken them. 
I did not succeed. The Old Man 
paid no attention to my struggles. 
I doubt if he was conscious; the 



slugs must simply immobilize the 
slave while occupied with splitting. 

By the time I had given up, 
worn out and sure that I could 
not break loose, I could see the 
silvery line down the center of 
the slug proper which means that 
fission is about to be complete. 
That was what changed my line 
of reasoning, if there were reason 
left in my churning skull. 

My hands were tied behind me, 
my ankles were tied, and I was 
belted tight across the middle to 
the chair. But my legs, even 
though fastened together, were 
free from my waist down. I 
slumped down to get even more 
reach and swung my legs up 
hi gh. I brought them down 
smashingly across the board — 
and set off every launching unit 
in her racks. 

The Old Man and I were both 
slammed back against the seats, 
he much harder than I, since I 
was strapped down. He was 
thrown so hard that his slug, 
open and helpless, was crushed. 

It splashed. 

Dad was caught in that terrible, 
total reflex, that spasm of every 
muscle that I had seen three 
times before. He bounced forward against the wheel, face contorted, fingers writhing. 

The car dived. 

I sat there and watched it dive, 
if you call it sitting when you 



156 




 



are held in place only by the belt. 
Dad's body had hopelessly fouled 
the controls; otherwise I might 
have been able to do something 
— gotten her headed up again, 
perhaps — with my bound feet. I 
tried, but with no success at all. 
The controls were probably jammed as well as fouled.' 

The altimeter was clicking 
away busily. We had dropped to 
eleven thousand feet before I 
found time to glance at it. Then 
it was nine . . . seven . . . six . . . 
and we entered our last mile. 

At fifteen hundred, the radar 
interlock cut in and the nose 
units fired one at a time. The 
belt buffeted me across the stomach each time. I was thinking that 
I was saved, that now the ship 
would level off — 

And I was still thinking so 
when we crashed. 

1CAME to by becoming slowly 
aware of a gently rocking motion. I was annoyed by it. I 
wanted it to stop; even a slight 
motion seemed to cause more 
pain than I could bear. I managed to get one eye open — the 
other would not open at all — and 
looked dully around for the 
source of my annoyance. 

Above me was the floor of the 
car, but I stared at it for a long 
time before I could identify it. 
By then I was somewhat aware 
of where I was and what had 



happened. I remembered the dive 
and the crash, and realized that 
we must have crashed not into 
the ground, but into some body 
of water. The Gulf of Mexico? 
I did not really care. 

My broken seat belt was flapping above me. My hands were 
still tied and so were my ankles, 
and one arm seemed to be broken. 
An eye was stuck shut and it hurt 
me to breathe. 

I quit taking stock of my injuries. 

Dad was no longer plastered 
against the wheel and that puzzled me. With painful effort. I 
rolled my head over to see the 
rest of the car with my one good 
eye. He was lying not far from 
me, three feet or so from my 
head to his. He was bloody and 
cold and I was sure that he was 
dead. I think it took me about a 
half hour to cross that short distance. 

I lay face to face with him, almost cheek to cheek. So far as 
I could tell, there was no trace 
of life, nor, from the odd and 
twisted way in which he lay. did 
it seem possible. 

"Dad," I said hoarsely. Then 
I screamed it. "Dad!" 

His eyes flickered but did not 
open. "Hello, son," he whispered. 
"Thanks, boy, thanks — " His 
voice died out. 

I wanted to shake him, but 
all I could do was shout. "Dad! 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



157 



Wake up — are you all right?" 

He spoke again, every word a 
painful task. "Your mother — said 
to tell you — she was — proud of 
you." His voice died out again 
and his breathing was labored in 
that ominous dry-stick sound. 

"Dad," I sobbed, "don't die. I 
can't get along without you." 

His eyes opened. "Yes, you can, 
son." He paused, then added, "I'm 
hurt, boy." His eyes closed again. 

I could not get any more out of 
him, though I shouted and 
screamed. Presently I put my face 
against his and let rny tears mix 
with the dirt and blood. 

Then I passed out again, and 
awoke in a hospital bed. Mary 
was kissing my face, bandages 
and all. 

"Dad!" I said, feeling that awful grief again. "He's dead, isn't 
he?" 

A wicked muffled voice answered. "Not a chance, son. I'm 
just as tough as you are." He 
grinned weakly at me through the 
window of an oxygen tent. . 

I grinned and fell asleep, holding Mary's hand. 

WE who are going to clean up 
Titan are all writing these 
reports. If we do not come back, 
' this is our legacy to free human 
beings — all that we know of how 
the titan parasites operate and 
what must be guarded against. 
For Kelly was right; there is no 



getting Humpty-Dumpty together 
again. In spite of the success of 
Schedule Mercy, there is no way 
to be sure that the slugs are all 
gone. Only last week a Kodiak 
bear was shot, up Yukon way, 
wearing a hump. 

The human race will have to 
be always on guard, especially 
about twenty -five years from 




T!5E 




 



now, if we don't come back — and 
the Flying Saucers do. We don't 
know why the titan monsters follow the twenty -nine -year cycle of 
Saturn's year, but they do. The 
reason may be simple; we ourselves have many cycles which 
match the Earth year. We hope 
that they are active only at one 
period of their year; if they are. 



Operation Vengeance may have 
easy pickings. Not that we are 
counting on it. 

I am going out. heaven help 
us, as an "applied psychologist 
(exotic)," but I am also a combat 
trooper, as is every one of us, 
from chaplain to cook. This is 
for keeps and we intend to show 
those slugs that they made the 




imstnkc of tangling with the 
toughest, meanest, deadliest, most 
unrelenting — and ablest — form of 
life 'n this section of space, a 
critter that can be killed but can't 
be turned. 

fl have a private hope that we 
will find some way to save the 
little elf creatures, the androgynes. I think we could get along 
with them.) 

Whether we make it or not, the 
human race has got to keep up its 
well-earned reputation for ferocity. The price of freedom is the 
willingness to do sudden battle, 
anywhere, anytime, and with utter selflessness. If we did not learn 
that from the slugs, well — "Dinosaurs, move over! We are ready 
to become extinct!" 

For who knows what dirty 
tricks may be lurking around this 
Universe? The slugs may be 
simple and open and friendly 
compared with, let us say, the 
natives of the planets of Sirius. 
If this is just the opener, we had 
better learn from it for the main 
event. We thought space was 
empty and that we were automatically the lords of creation. 
Even after we '"conquered" space, 
we thought so, for Mars was already dead and Venus had not 
really gotten started. Well, if Man 
wants to be top dog — or even a 
respftted neighbor — he'll have to 
fight for it. 

Eftry one of us who is going 



has been possessed at least once. 
Only those who have been hagridden can know how tricky the 
slugs are, how constantly one 
must be on guard— or how deeply 
one must hate. The trip, they 
tell me, will take about twelve 
years, which will give Mary and 
me time to finish our honeymoon. 
Oh, yes, Mary is going; most of 
us are married couples and the 
single men are balanced by single 
women. Twelve years isn't a trip; 
it's a way of living. 

When I told Mary that we were 
going to Saturn's moons, her 
single comment was, "Yes, dear." 

We'll have time to have two 
or three kids. As Dad says, "The 
race must go on, even if it doesn't 
know where." 

I am now finishing this report 
in Space Station Beta, from 
which we will transship to U. N. 
S. Avenger. We said good-bye to 
Dad last night at Pikes Peak 
Port. He corrected me. "So long, 
you mean. You'll be back and I 
intend to hang on, getting crankier every year, until you do.*' 

I said I hoped so. He nodded. 
"You'll make it and so will I. 
We're both too tough and mean 
to die. I've got a lot of confidence 
in you and the likes of you, son." 

We are about to transship. I 
feel exhilarated. Puppet masters 
— the free men are coming to kill 
you
