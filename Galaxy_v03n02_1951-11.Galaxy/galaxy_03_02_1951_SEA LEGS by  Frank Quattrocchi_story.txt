SEA LEGS by  Frank Quattrocchi


FLIGHT Officer Robert 
Craig surrendered the tube 
containing his service record tapes and stood waiting while 
the bored process clerk examined 
the seal. 

"Your clearance," said the 
clerk. 

Craig handed him a battered 
punch card and watched the man 
insert it in the reproducer. He 
felt anxiety as the much-handled 
card refused for a time to match 
the instrument's metal contact 
points. The line of men behind 
Craig fidgeted. 

"You got to get this punched 
by Territorial," said the clerk. 
"Take it back to your unit's 
clearance office." 

"Look again. Sergeant," Craig 
said, repressing his irritation. 

"It ain't notched." 

"The hell it isn't." 

The man examined the card 
with squinting care and nodded 
finally. "It's so damn notched/' 
he complained. "You ought to 



SEA LEGS 



take care of that card; can't get 
on without one" 

Craig hesitated before moving. 
"Next," said the clerk. "What 
you waiting for?" 

"Don't I take my 201 hie?" 
"We send it on ahead. Go to 
Grav 1 desk." 

A murmur greeted the order. 
Craig experienced the thrill of 
knowing the envy of the others. 
Grav 1 — that meant Terra. He 
crossed the long, dreary room, 
knowing the eyes of the other 
men were upon him. 

"Your service tapes," the next 
noncom said. "Where you going?"' 
"Grav 1 — Terra" fumbled 
Craig. "Los Angeles." 

"Los Angeles, eh? Where in Los 
Angeles?" ■ . 

i "I — X — M Craig muttered, fumbling in his pockets. 

"No specific destination," supplied the man as he punched a 
key on a small instrument. "AirJock ahead and to your right 
Strip and follow the robot's orders. Any metal?" 

"Metal?" asked Craig. 
"You know, metal." 
"Well, my identification key." 
"Here," commanded the clerk, 
extending a plastic envelope. 

Craig moved in the direction 
indicated. He fought the irrational fear that he had missed 
an important step in the complicated clerical process. He 
cursed the grudging attitude of 



the headquarters satellite personnel and felt the impotence of 
a spaceman who had long forgotten the bureaucracy of a rear 
area base. The knowledge that 
much of it was moti va ted by 
envy soothed him as he clumsily 
let himself into the lock. 

"Place your clothing in the receptacle provided and assume a 
stationary position on the raised 
podium in the center of the lock." 

Cratg obeyed the robot voice 
and began reluctantly to remove 
his flight jacket. Its incredibly 
fine-grained leather would carry, 
none of the strange, foreign associations for the base station clerk 
who , would appropriate it. He 
would never know the beautiful, 
gentle beast that supplied this 
skin. 

"You are retarding the progress 
of others. Please respond more 
quickly to your orders." 

Craig quickly removed the last 
of his clothing. It was impossible 
to hate a robot, but one could 
certainly hate those who set it 
into operation. 

"You will find a red button at 
your feet. Lower your head and 
depress that button." 

Stepping on the button with 
his bare foot produced an instant 
of brilliant blue illumination. A 
small scratch on his arm stung 
briefly and he was somewhat 
blinded by the flash even through 
his eyelids, but that was all there 



i 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



was to the sterilizing process. 

"Your clothing and effects will 
be in the dressing room immediately beyond the locked door." 

He found his clothing cleanly 
and neatly hung on plastic 
h«ngers just inside the door to 
the dressing room. The few personal items he carried in his 
pockets were still there. The 
Schtaan flight jacket was actually 
there, looking like new, its spaceblue uniaded and as wonderfully 
pliant as before. 

"Insert your right arm into the 
instrument on the central table," 
commanded the same voice he 
had heard before. "Turn your 
aim until the scratch is in contact with the metal plate. There 
will be a slight pain, but it is 
necessary to treat the small injury 
you have been disregarding." 

Craig obeyed and clenched his 
teeth against a sharp stinging. 
His respect for the robot-controlled equipment of bases had 
risen. When he withdrew his arm, 
the scratch was neatly coated 
with a layer of flesh-colored plastic material. 

He dressed quickly and was on 
the verge of asking the robot for 
instructions, when a man appeared in the open doorway. 

"I am Captain Wyandotte," 
said the man in a pleasant voice. 

"Well, what*s next?" asked 
Craig somewhat more belligerently than he had intended. 



The man smiled. "Your reaction is quite natural. You are 
somewhat aggressive after Clerical, eh?" 

"I'm a little anxious to get 
home, I suppose," said Craig defensively. 

"By 'home' you mean Terra. 
But you've never been there, have 
you?" 

"No, but my father — " 

"Your parents left Terra during the Second Colonization of 
Cassiopeia II, didn't they?** 

"Yes," Craig said. He was uncomfortable; Wyandotte seemed 
to know all about him. 

"We might say you've been 
away ejuite a while, eh?" 

"I was entered as a spaceman 
when 1 was 16." Craig said. "I've 
never been down for any period 
as yet." 

"You mean you haven't been 
in a gravity system?** 

"Oh, I've landed a few limes, 
even walked around for m 
while . . .*' 

"With the help of paraoxylnebutal," supplied the captain. 

"Well, sure." 

"Mr. Craig, I suppose you've 
guessed that the next step in our 
little torture system here ia 
psych." 

"So I gathered.** 

The captain laughed reassuringly. "No, don't put up your 
guard again. The worst is over. 
Short of Gravitational condition


SEA LEGS 



ing, there is nothing to stop you 
from going to Terra." 

"Sorry, I guess I'm a little 
touchy. This is my -first time . . *"Quite natural. But it being 
your first time — in quite a number of ways, I might add — it will 
be necessary for you to undergo 
some conditioning." 

"Conditioning?" asked Craig. 
"Yes. You have spent eleven 
years in space. Your body is conditioned to a normal state of free 
fall, or at best to a state of 
acceleration.*' 

"Yeah, I know. Once on Gerymeade . . ." 

"You were ill, couldn't keep 
your balance, felt dizzy. That is 
why all spacemen carry PON", 
paraoxylnebutal, with them. It 
helps suppress certain physiological reactions to an entirely new 
set of conditions. Channels of 
the ear, for example. They play 
an important part in our awareness of balance. They operate on 
a simple gravity principle. Without gravity they act up for a 
time, then gradually lose function. Returning to gravity is 
rather frightening at first." 

"I know all about this, Captain." 

"You've undoubtedly read 
popularizations in tapezines. But 
you have experienced it briefly." 

"I expect to have some trouble 
at first." Craig was disturbed by 
the wordy psychologist. What was 



the man actually saying? 

"Do you know what sailors of 
ancient times meant by 'sea 
legs?' ? asked Wyandotte. "Men 
on a rolling ocean acclimated 
themselves to a rolling horizontal. 
They had trouble when they went 
ashore and the horizontal didn't 
roll any more." 

"It meant more than that. 
There were excellent psychological reasons for the old stereotype, the 'drunken sailor.' A port 
city was a frightening thing to 
an old sailor^ — but let's begin our 
little job at the beginning. I'll 
turn you over to psychometry for 
the usual tests and pick you up 
tomorrow morning at, say, 0900." 

TOURING the days that fol-L' lowed, the psychologist 
seemed to Craig to become progressively more didactic. He 
would deliver long speeches about 
the "freedom of open space." He 
spoke repetitiously of the "growing complexity of Terran society." And yet the man could not 
be pinned down to any specific 
condition the spaceman would 
find intolerable. 

Craig began to hate the delay 
that kept him from Terra. 
Through the ports of the headquarters base satellite, he scanned 
the constellations for the scores 
of worlds he had visited during 
his eleven years in space. They 
were incredibly varied, even those 



* 




 



that supported life. He had 
weathered difficult landings on 
worlds with rip-tide gravities, had 
felt the pull of the incredible 
star-tides imparted by twin and 
even triple star systems. He had 
been on Einstein IV, the planet 
of eight moons, and had felt the 
pulse of all eight of the satellites 
at once that no pon could completely nullify. 

But even if he could accept 
the psychologist's authority for 
the cumulative effect of a gravity 
system, he could not understand 
the unspoken warning he felt underlying all that the man said. 

"Of course it has changed," 
Craig was protesting. "Anyway, 
I never really knew very much 
about Terra. So what? I know 
it won't be as it was in tapezines 
either." 

"Yet you are completely sure 
you will want to live out your life 
there, that you are willing to give 
up space service for it." 

"We've gone through this time 
and time again," Craig said wearily. "I gave you my reasons 
for quitting space. We analyzed 
them. You agreed that you could 
not decide that for me and that 
my decision is logical. You tell 
me spacemen don't settle down 
on Terra. Yet you won't — or can't 
■ — tell me why. I've got a damned 
good job there — " 

"You may find that 'damned 
good jobs* become boring." 



"So I'll transfer. I don't know 
what you're trying to get at. Captain, but you're not talking me 
out of going back. If the service 
needs men so badly, let them get 
somebody else. I've put in my 
time." 

"Do you really think that's my 
reason?" 

"Sure. What else can it be?" 

"Mr. Craig," the psychologist 
said slowly, "you have my authorization for you to return to 
Terra as a private citizen of that 
planet. You will be given a very 
liberal supply of pon — which you 
will definitely need. Good luck. 
You'll need that too." 

^"\N the eighth day, two attendants, who showed the effects 
of massive doses of pon to protect themselves from the centrifugal force, had to carry a man 
out of the tank. Many others 
asked to be removed, begged to 
be allowed to withdraw thrir 
resignations. 

"The twelfth day is the worst," 
a grizzled spaceman told Craig. 
"That's when the best of 'em 
want out." 

Craig clenched the iron rung 
©f his bed and struggled to bring 
the old man's face into focus. 

"How . . . how do they know 
when you ought ... -to come 
out?" he asked between waves 
of nausea. 

"Blood pressure. They get you 



SEA LEGS 



* 



just before you go iato shock." 

"How can they tell ?" Craig 
fought down his growing panic. 
**I can't." 

"That strap around your belly. 
You mean you ain't noticed it?" 

"Haven't noticed much of anything." 

"Well, it's keyed to give them 
some kind of signal." 

The old man lapsed into silence. Craig wished him to continue. He desperately wanted 
something to distract his mind 
from the ghastly conditioning 
process. 

Slowly at first, the lines formed 
by seams in the metal ceiling 
began to bend. Here it came 
again! 

"Old man!" shouted Craig. 

"Yeah, son. They've dropped 
it down a notch." 

"Dropped . . . it . . . down?" 

"Maybe that ain't scientific, 
but it's the way I always think 
of it." 

"Can't they . . . drop it down 
continuously?" 

"They tried that a few times 
— once when I was aboard. 
You wouldn't like it, kid. You 
wouldn't like it at all." 

"How . . . many times . . . do 
they drop it?" 

"Four times during the day, 
three at night. Twenty days." 

A nightmare of visual sensations ebbed into Craig's mind. He 
was vaguely aware of the moans 



of other men In the vaultlike 
room. Wave upon wave of nausea 
swept him as he watched the seam 
lines bend and warp fantastically. 
He snapped his eyelids shut, only 
to begin feeling the nightmarish 
bodily sensations once more. He 
felt the cot slowly rise longitudinally, felt himself upside down, 
then the snap of turning right 
side up once more — and he knew 
that neither he nor the cot had 
moved so much as an inch. 

Craig heard the voices around 
him, muffled, as though talking 
through wadding. 
". . . got it bad." 
"We better take him out.*' 
*'. . . pretty bad." 
"He'll go into shock." 
"... never make it the twelfth.** 
"We better yank him." 
"I'm ... all right," Craig mumbled at the voices. He struggled 
with the bonds of his cot. With 
terrible effort he forced his eyes 
open. Two white-clad figures, 
ridiculously out of proportion, 
hovered wraithlike over him. 
Four elongated eyes peered at 
him. 

Attendants coming for to take 
me home . . . 

"Touch me and I'll kick your 
teeth in!" he yelled. "I'm going 
to Terra. Wish you weTe going 
to Terra?" 

Then it was better. Oddly, he 
passed the twelfth day easily. 
By the fourteenth day, Craig 




 



knew he could stand Grav r. 
The whine of the centrifuge's 
motors had diminished to a low 
hum. Either that or they had 
begun to produce ultra-sonic 
waves. Craig was not sure. 

Most of the men had passed 
through the torments of gravitational conditioning. The huge 
headquarters base centrifuge 
aboard the man-made satellite 
had gradually caused their bodies 
to respond once more to a single 
source of pull. They were now 
ready to become inhabitants of 
planets again, instead of freefalling ships. 

On the eighteenth day, automatic machinery freed them 
from their imprisoning cots. 
Clumsily and awkwardly at first, 
the men began to walk, to hold 
their heads and arms in proper 
attitudes. They laughed and 
joked about it and kidded those 
who were slow at adjusting. Then 
they again began taking paraoxylnebutal in preparation for the 
free-fall flight to Terra. 

Only one of the score of men 
in the centrifuge tank remained 
voluntarily in his cot. 

"Space article violator," the 
old man informed Craig. "Psycho, 
I think. Went amuck with some 
extraterritorials. Killed a dozen." 

"What will they do, exile him?" 

"Not to Chociante, if that's 
what you mean. They just jerked 
his space card and gave him a 



one-way ticket to Terra.** 

"For twelve murders?" asked 
Craig incredulously. 

"That's enough, son." The old 
man eyed Craig for an instant 
before looking away. "Pick something to talk about. What do you 
figure on doing when you get 
to Terra, for instance?" 

"I'm going into Import. My father was in it for twenty years." 

"Sure," said the old spaceman, 
watching a group of young crewmen engaged in an animated conversation. 

"It's a good job. There's a future to it." 

"Yeah." 

Why did he have to explain 
anything at all to the old space 
tramp? 

"Once I get set up, I'll probably try to open my own business." 

"And spend your weekends on 
Luna." 

Craig half rose from his cot, 
jarred into anger. 

But the old spaceman turned, 
smiling wryly. "Don't get hot, 
kid. I guess I spent too long in 
Zone V." He paused to examine 
his wrinkled hands. They were 
indelibly marked with lever callouses. "You get to thinking anyone who stays closer'n eighty 
light years from Terra is a landlubber." 

Craig relaxed, realizing he had 
acted childishly, "Used to think 



SEA LEGS 



11 



the same. Then I took the exam 
and got this job." r 

"Whereabouts?" 

"Los Angeles." 

The old man looked up at 
Craig. "You don't know much 
about Terra, do you, son?" 

"Not much." 

"Yeah. Well, I hope you ain't 
disappointed." 

" My father was born there, 
but I never saw it. Never hit the 
Solar System, matter of fact. 
Never saw much of anything close 
up. I stood it a lortg time, old 
man, this hitting atmospheres all 
over the Universe." 

But the spaceman seemed to 
have lost interest. He was unpacking some personal belongings from a kit. 

"What are you doing in Grav 
1?" Craig asked. 

The old man's face clouded for 
an instant. "In the old days, they 
used to say us old-timers acted 
like clocks. They used to say we 
just ran down. Now they got 
some fancy psychology name for 
it." 

Craig regretted his question. He 
would have muttered some word 
of apology, but the old man continued. 

"Maybe you've read some of 
the old sea stories, or more'n 
likely had 'em read to you. Sailors could go to sea until they just 
sort of dried up. The sea tanned 
. their skins and stiffened their 



bones, but it never stiffened their 
hearts. When they got old, it just 
pulled them in. 

"But space is different. Space 
is raw and new. It tugs at your 
guts. It sends the blood rushing 
through your veins. It's like loving. You don't become a part of 
space the way you do the old 
sea, though. It leaves you strictly 
alone. Except that it sucks you 
dry, takes all the soup out of 
you, leaves you brittle and old — 
old as a dehydrated piece of split 
leather. 

"Then one day it shoots a spurt 
of blood around in one of your 
old veins. Something gives. Space 
is through with you then. And 
if you can stand this whirligig 
conditioning", you're through with 
space." 

"yOU can't figure it. Some of 
J- 'em urp all over and turn six 
shades of green." 

"You got to watch the ones 
that don't.** 

"Yeah, you got to watch the 
ones that don't. Especially th& 
old ones." 

"He's old. You think it was hia 
heart?" 

"Who knows? 1 * 

"They'll dump turn, worCi 
they?" 

"After a tracer is sent through. 
But it won't do any good." 

"He probably outlived everybody that ever knew him.'*

GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOA 



"Wouldn't be surprised. Here, 
grab his leg." 

ROBERT Craig folded the 
flight jacket tightly and 
stuffed it into the cylindrical carton. A sleeve unwound just as he 
did so, making it difficult to fit 
into the place he had made for 
it. Exasperated, he refolded it and 
jammed it in place. Smaller rolls 
of underclothing were then fitted 
in. When he was satisfied with 
the layer, he tossed in a small 
handful of crystals and began to 
fill the next layer. After the carton was completely filled, he 
ignited the sealing strip and 
watched as the plastic melted 
into a single, seamless whole. It 
was ready for irradiation. Probably in another ten years his 
son-to-be would put it on and 
play spaceman. But Craig swore 
he'd make sure that the kid 
knew what a stinking life it was. 

At 1 300 hours, the ferry 
bumped heavily alongside the 
starboard lock. It was the signal 
for relief in the passengers' quarters ; many were beginning to feel 
a reaction to the short free-fall 
flight from the headquarters satellite. 

The audio called out: "Flight 
Officer Robert Craig. Flight Officer Robert Craig. Report to Orderly 12. Report to Orderly 12 
through the aft door.** 

With pangs of anxiety he could 



not completely suppress, Craig 
obeyed. 

Orderly 12 handed him a message container. 

"Who's it from? Somebody on 
Terra?" 

"From a private spaceman 
named Morgan Brockman." 
"Brockman?" 

"He was with you in the grav 
tank." 

"The old man!" 

The message container produced a battered punch card. 
Craig straightened it and was 
about to reach into his pocket 
for a hand transcriber. But then 
he noticed the card bore only a 
few irregular punches and was 
covered with rough hand printing. 

Son, when the flunkies get around 
to giving you this, they'll have shot 
me out the tube. How do I know? 
Same way you know when your turbos 
are going to throw a blade. It's good 
this way. 

.There's something you can do for 
me if you want to. Way back, some 
fifty years ago, there was a woman. 
She was my wife. It's a long story I 
won't bother you with. Anyway, I left 
her. Wanted to take her along with 
me, but she wouldn't go. 

Earth was a lot different then than 
it ia now. They don't have to tell me; 
I know. I saw it coming and so did 
Ethel. We talked about it and I knew 
I had to go. She wouldn't or couldn't 
go. Wanted me to stay, but I couldn't. 

I tried to send her some units once 
in a while. Don't know if she ever got 
them. Sometimes I forgot to send them 
at all. You know, you're way out across 
the Galaxy, while she's home. 

Go see her if you can, son. Will you? 
Make sure she gets the unit transfer 



SEA LEGS 



13 



I made out. It isn't much out of seventy 
years of living, but she may need it. 
And maybe you can tell her a little 
bit about what it means to be out 
there. Tell her it's open and free and 
when you got hold of those levers and 
you're trying for an orbit on something 
big and new and green . . . Hell, you 
remember. You know how to tell her. 

Her name is Ethel Brockman. I know 
she'll still use my name. Her address 
is or was East 71, North 101, Number 
4. You can trace her easy if she moved. 
Women don't generally shove off and 
not leave a forwarding address. Not 
Ethel, at least. 

Craig put the battered card in 
his pocket and walked back 
through the door to the passenger 
room. How did you explain to 
an old woman why her husband 
deserted her fifty years before? 
Some kind of story about one's 
duty to the Universe? No, the 
old man had not been in Intergalactic. He had been a tramp 
spaceman. Well, why had he left? 

Fifty years in space. Fifty 
years! Zone V had been beyond 
anybody's imagination that long 
ago. He must have been in. on 
the first Cetusian flights and shot 
the early landings in Cetus II. 
God only knew how many times 
he had battled Zone 111b pirates . . . 

Damn the old man! How did 
one explain? 

CRAIG descended the ramp 
from the huge jet and concentrated on his impressions. One 
day he would recall this moment, 

14 i 



his first on the planet Terra. He 
tried to recall his first thrill at 
seeing Los Angeles, 1500 square 
miles of it, from the ship as it 
entered the atmosphere. 

He was about to step off the 
last step when a man appeared 
hurriedly. A rather plump man, 
he displayed a toothy smile on 
his puffy red face. 

"A moment, sir. Just a little 
greeting from the Terra. You 
understand, . of course. Purely 
routine." 

Craig remained on the final 
step of the ramp, puzzled. The 
man turned to a companion at 
his right. 

"We can see that this gentleman has come from a long, long 
way off, can't we?" 

The other man did not look 
up. He was peering into what 
seemed to Craig to be a kind of 
camera. 

"We can allow the gentlemen 
to continue now, can't we? It 
wasn't that we believed for a 
minute, you understand . . • 
purely routine." 

Both men were gone in an 
instant, leaving Craig completely 
bewildered. 

"You goin' to move on, buddy, 
or you want to go back?" 

Craig turned to face a line of 
his fellow passengers up the ramp 
behind him. 

"Who was that?" Craig asked 

"Customs. Bet you never got 

iALAXY SCIENCE F I C T I O 14 



such a smooth screening before, 
eh?" 

"You mean he screened me? 
What Tor?" 

"Hard to say," the other passenger said. "You'll get used to 
this. They get it over with quick." 

Craig made his way toward 
the spaceport administration 
building. His first physical contact with Terra had passed unnoticed. 

"Sir! Sir!" cried a voice behind 
him. 

He wheeled to see a man walking briskly toward him. 

"You dropped this, sir. Quite 
by accident, of course." 

Craig examined the small object the man had given him before rushing oft' toward an exit. 

It was an empty pon tube he 
had just discarded. He couldn't 
understand why the man had 
bothered until he realized that 
the plastaloid floor of the lobby 
displayed not the faintest scrap 
of paper nor trace of dirt. 

HPHE Import personnel man 
was toying with a small chip 
of gleaming metal. He did not 
look directly at Craig for more 
than an instant at a time, and 
commented on Craig's description 
of his trip through the city only 
very briefly between questions. 

"It's a good deal bigger than 
I imagined," Craig was saying. 
"Haven't seen much of it, of 



course. Thought I'd check in here 
with you first." 

"Yes, naturally." 

"Thought you could give me 
some idea of conditions . . ." 

"Conditions?" 

"For instance, what part of the 
city I should live in. That is, 
what part is closest to where I'll 
work." 

"I see," said the man noncommittally. It seemed to Craig that 
he was about to add something. 
He did not, however, but instead 
rose from his chair and walked 
to the large window overlooking 
an enormous section of the city 
far below. He stared out the window for a time, leaving Craig 
seated uncomfortably in the silent 
room. There was a distracted 
quality about him. Craig thought. 

"You are the first man we have 
had from the Intergalactic Service," the personnel man said 
finally. 

"That so?" 

"Yes." He turned to face Craig 
briefly before continuing. "You 
must find it very strange here." 

"Well, I've never seen a city 
so big." 

"Yes, so big. And also . . ." He 
seemed to consider many words 
before completing the sentence. 
"And also different." 

"I haven't been here very long," 
said Craig. "Matter of fact, I 
haven't been anywhere very long. 
This is my first real experience 



SEA LEGS 



15 



with life on a planet. As an adult, 
anyway." 

The personnel man seated himself once more and pressed a button on a small instrument. A 
secretary entered the office from 
a door to Craig's left. 

"Miss Wendel, this is Mr. 
Craig. Mr. Craig, my secretary. 
Mr. Craig will enter Minerals and 
Metals, Zone V." 

They exchanged formal greetings. She was a moderately pretty 
girl of medium height and, to 
Craig, a pleasantly rounded figure. He would have attempted to 
catch her eye had she not immediately occupied herself with 
unfolding the legs of a small instrument she was carrying. 

"This is Mr. Craig's first landing on Terra, Miss Wendel," the 
personnel man continued. "Actually, we shall have to consider 
him in much the same way we 
would an extraterrestrial." 

The girl glanced at Craig, casting him a cool, impersonal smile. 

"He was formerly a flight officer in the Intergalactic Space 
Service." The statement was delivered in an almost exaggeratedly 
casual tone. 

The giii glanced at him once 
more, this time with a definite 
quizzical look in her brown eyes. 

"Three complete tours of duty, 
1 believe." 

"Four," corrected Craig. "Four 
tours of three years each, minus 



a year's terminal leave." 

"I take it you have no identification card?" the man asked. 

"The one I held in the service. 
It's pretty comprehensive." 

The other turned to the secretary. "You'll see that he is assisted in filing his application, 
won't you? A provisional Code II. 
That will enable you to enter all 
Import offices freely, Mr. Craig." 

"Will he need a food and — 
clothing ration also?" asked the 
girl, without looking at Craig. 

"Yes." The man laughed. 
"You'll excuse us, Mr. Craig. We 
realize that you couldn't be expected to be familiar with Terra's fashions. In your present outfit you would certainly be typed 
as a , . . well, you'd be made 
uncomfortable." 

Craig reddened in spite of himself. He had bought the suit on 
Ghandii. 

"A hick," he supplied. 
"I wouldn't go that far, but 
some people might." 

CRAIG noted the pleasant way 
the girl filled her trim, rather 
severe business suit. He amused 
himself by calculating stress patterns in its plain woven material 
as she assembled the forms for 
him. 

"Here, Mr. Craig. I believe 
these are complete." 

"They look pretty complicated."

"Not at all. The questions are 
quite explicit." 

Craig looked them over quickly. 

"I guess so. Say, Miss Wendel, 
I was wondering — I don't know 
the city at all. Maybe you could 
go with me to have dinner. It 
must be almost dinnertime now. 
You could sort of check me out 
on some . . 

"I'm afraid that would be quite 
impossible. You couldn't gain admittance to any office you need 
to visit tonight. Therefore, it is 
impossible for me to be of any 
assistance to you." 

"Oh, come now, Miss Wendel. 
There are women aboard spaceships. I'm not a starved wolf.*' 

"Certainly you are not, Mr. 
Craig. But it is not possible for 
me . . 

"You said that already, but 
you can have dinner with me. 
Just company." 

"I'm afraid I don't understand." 

THE Galactic hotel strove to 
preserve an archaic tone of 
hospitality. It advertised "a 
night's lodgings" and it possessed 
a bellboy. The bellboy actually 
carried Craig's plasticarton and 
large file of punch cards and 
forms to his room. Tired from the 
long, confusing day, Craig was 
not impressed. He vaguely wondered if the little drama of the 



hotel carried so far as a small 
fee to be paid the bellboy, and 
he hoped he would have the right 
size of Terran units in his wallet. 

Outside the door to the room, 
the bellboy stopped and turned 
to Craig. 

"For five I'll tell you where it 
is," he said in a subdued tone. 

"Tell me where what is?" 

"You know, the mike." 

"Mike?" 

"All right, mister, three units, 
then. I wasn't trying to hold you 
up." 

"You mean a microphone?** 
asked Craig, mechanically fishing for his wallet. 

"Sure, they don't put in screens 
here. Wanted to, but the boss 
convinced 'em there aren't any 
Freedomites ever stay here." 

"Where is the microphone?" 
Craig asked as he found a ten 
unit note. He was too puzzled 
to wonder what he was expected 
to do with the information. 

"It's in the bed illuminator. 
You can short it out with a razor 
blade. Or I'll do it for another 
two." 

"Never mind," Craig said wearily. He waited while the bellboy 
inserted a key into the door and 
opened it for him. 

"I can get you a sensatia-tape,'* 
whispered the boy when they had 
entered. He nudged Craig wickedly. "You know what they're 
like?'*

"Yeah," Craig said disgustedly. 
Traffic in the illicit mental-image 
tapes was known as far into space 
as lonely men had penetrated. 
Intergalactic considered them as 
great a menace to mental and 
moral stability as the hectopiates. 
Craig wearily got the man out of 
the room, took a PON pill, and 
eased himself into the bed. 

It had been a weird day and 
he had not liked it. There was no 
telling how long it would .take 
him to shake his — sea legs, the 
psychologist had called it. One 
thing was sure : Terra aggressively went a f ter its strangers. 

USHERED into the room by a 
sullen and silent secretory, 
Craig found himself facing a 
semi-circulor table at which were 
seated five uniformed men. The 
center man, obviously their superior, rose to greet him. He wore 
the familiar smile Craig had come 
to know so well and hate so 
much. The man was somewhat 
over forty years old, short, stout, 
entirely unpleasant and puffy. 

"Mr. Craig, I believe," he 
greeted Craig. Since it seemed to 
be more of a statement than a 
question, Craig did not answer. 
He took up a position of- more 
or less military attention at the 
center of the curved table. 

"You are Robert Craig,'* insisted the man. 

"Yes, I'm Robert Craig," he 



answered, somewhat surprised. 

The stout man seated himself 
with a sigh and began to sort 
through some papers on the table 
before him. The other four men 
continued to stare at Craig silently, until he began to feel uncomfortable and hostile. He 
stiffened his position of attention 
defiantly. 

"You may relax, Mr. Craig." 
said the first man without looking 
up. "You aren't nervous, are 
you?" 

"No," Craig said, trying to 
smile. "This is the first time I've 
been here and . ." He let the 
sentence trail off, hoping for a 
sympathetic response. But he did 
not get it. 

"Flight Officer, eh?" said the 
man. Then, looking up, he added, 
"Somewhat unusual to find a 
vigorous young man like yourself 
abandoning the space service for 
a Terran job, isn't it?" 
"I don't know. Is it?" 
"Leaving something behind out 
there, Mr. Craig?" 

"No, nothing," Craig snapped. 
The other man glared at him 
a full minute. Craig met the stare 
and realized the considerable 
power behind the weak face. 

"You don't like this sort of 
affair, do you, Mr. Craig?" 

Craig was forced to look away. 
"I'm afraid I don't see the necessity," he answered in a controlled 
voice. "I serve-d the Intergalactic

Service well. My records prove 
that." 

"Granted," said his questioner 
bluntly. "You are a Terran, are 
you not, Mr. Craig?" 

"I should think that would be 
obvious," Craig said, matching 
the blunt tone. 

The man rapped the table. 
"That's enough of your impertinence! You may very well have 
served the Intergalactic Service, 
but you are on. Terra now. Terra, 
greatest, first of all civilized systems. Intergalactic may very well 
have to piddle with incompetent 
savages and wild colonists, but 
we of Terra assert our supremacy. 
Remember those words. You may 
not always find Terra so submissive to Intergalactic as Intergalactic would desire." 

''Where are your loyalties, Mr. 
C rai g ?" demanded one of tH e 
other men suddenly. . 

"I am a Terran . . .** 

"But your first loyalty is to 
Intergalactic. Is that right?" 

"Is there a distinction?" Craig 
shot back, thoroughly angry. 

"Do you wish to be held in 
contempt of this committee?" 
asked the first matt, leaning forward half out of his chair. 

"Of course not." 

"Then you will confine your 
responses to simple yes and ho 
answers, if you please, Mr. 
Craig." 

Craig glared at the men in im


potent rage. His head was beginning to ache. He had been many 
hours without paraoxylnebutal. 

"Now, Mr. Craig." the first 
man began in an overly mild 
tone, "we shall begin again. Please 
try to restrain your show of emotion. You are here in petition of 
an identity card of provisional 
Code II type. You maintain that 
you have never been on Terra 
before. Indeed, you state that you 
have never had a political affiliation." 

"Yes." 

"What are your reactions to the 
latest acts of the Liberty party?" 
a third man abruptly asked. 

"I have none," Craig answered, 
after an instant of confusion. 

"You do not condemn the Liberty party?" 

"I . . . I . . 

"Then you must favor it" 

"I don't know anything about 
any . . ." 

"Now, then, Mr. Craig," interrupted the head of the group.. 
"The Import service report shows 
that you passed your tests aboard 
your ship. You were enabled to 
accomplish this through night 
study." 

"Yes." 

"Yet you maintain in your application that you had considered 
the space service a career.** 

"I changed my mind." 

"Oh. You changed your mind, 
I see . ,

"XFTHAT do you do if they 
turn you down on your 
food ration?" Craig asked the 
man by his side on the bench. He 
had intended it as a vaguely humorous question. 

"You don't eat." 

"You mean they would actually let you starve?" 

"If you could not eat, you 
would starve," the man said 
matter-of-factly. 

"What's all this for, anyway? 
I mean the medical part." 

"You are rationed fairly in accordance with your particular 
metabolism." 

"You're kidding." 

"One does not jest of such matters," said the man, getting up to 
take a seat on another bench. 

"But I'd like to keep it as a 
souvenir'* 

"It is not permitted." 

"Look, it isn't issue. I bought 
the hide, had it made. I can pull 
off the marks of insignia and it's 
just another jacket . . ." 

"That is not the point, Mr. 
Craig. Your clothing ration is 
defined by law. There are no 
exceptions." 

"These are your permanent 
Quarters. You will occupy them 
immediately. Then, if you believe the location is wasteful of 
your time, you must petition the 
appropriate committee. This de


partment cannot accept such a 
petition." 

"Your petition to be permitted 
to purchase a private means of 
conveyance is hereby denied." 

THE big man leaned far back 
in the battered desk chair. It 
creaked at worn joints, but 
touched the wall without sliding 
from under its enormous load. 
The *nan was silent through 
Craig's long, confused speech. By 
turns he examined his fingernails, 
picked at yellowed teeth, and 
stared above his head at the discolored ceiling. 

". . . but you can get all this 
from iss, maybe even from Import, if they'll release my file," 
Craig argued. 

"Uh-huh," the big man said 
between closed lips. 

"I just made a mistake, that's 
all. You don't hear much about 
Terra out there. It was different 
in my father's day. It must have 
been different." 
"Yeah." 

"I haven't any character references on Terra, but I can post 
a good-sized bond if they'll release my ISS units." 

The space - freight agent 
glanced up at Craig at the remark. 

"Anyway, I can get my units 
anywhere iss has a base," Craig 
continued. "I can handle any

tiling up to 15 Gs acceleration 
without a new license. I can go 
heavier if I get a check ride." 

The fat man leaned forward in 
the protesting chair. "You got 
everything, but you can't go. I 
can't hire you." 

"Why not?" 

"Look, kid — Craig, is it? — how 
long you been in?" 

"Four days. I'm still working 
on my work clearances." 

"Four days. You tried Intergalactic to see if they'd take you 
back?" 

"Yes. Their hands are tied by 
my Terran contract." 

"And ours aren't, eh?" The 
man rose from t he desk and 
walked to a water tap. He popped 
a pill into his gaping mouth and 
drank from a tin cup. Then he 
returned to the inadequate chair. 
"So you're a spaceman. Flight 
officer — ex-flight officer. You 
know how to navigate through 
four star zones and the asteroid 
belt thrown in. You got a license 
for 15 Gs, could get five more. 
You got enough brains to pass 
Import's senior router's exam. 

"Still, you ain't got enough 
sense to come in out of the rain I" 

Craig sat upright in his chair. 

"We get guys like you two, 
three a day. You're hot. You're 
big. You're rarin* to go. But you 
ain't goin* nowhere!" 

Craig glared at .the big man. 

"I don't know how you got

business. Maybe you did quit 
honorable. Quit to follow your 
daddy's footsteps. Or maybe you 
went and burned up a colony 
somewhere !" 

"That would be in my records, 
wouldn't it?" Craig challenged. 

"It still don't make any difference. You're stuck here. Nobody;

Wordlessly she slid into the booth 
opposite him and made a sign 
for the bartender. 

"Have a drink?" Craig suggested, smiling. 
"Yeah." 
"Work here?" 
"What you mean by that?" 
"I mean if you get a percentage 
on the drinks, I can . . .** 
"I don't get no percentage," 
The bartender brought them a 
version of N'cadian taz. The girl 
■louched in the booth and sullenly tapped the glass. The lights 
in the bar had dimmed to simulate some kind of planetary night. 
The walls came alive with projected images of Terran constellations. On their table, a globe 
lamp began to glow. Tiny bright 
lights swung orbits around a 
miniature sun inside the lamp. 

As a miniature Pluto swung on 
its slow arc, an image of it was 
projected on the girl's dusky face. 



She seemed to be staring at nothing. 

"Why d'you call mc over 
here? You a purist, or don't you 
like the brand of sensatia -tapes 
they're peddlin' these days?" 

"I don't understand," Craig 
said. 

She smiled crookedly at him. 
Not a bad face, Craig decided, 
but hard, hard as the ceramiplate 
of a ship. She could not be very 
old. It was the kind of wild look 
in her eyes that gave her a false 
appearance of age. 

"Maybe you're writing a book 
—you got me over here for something." 

"I just got in," Craig answered. 

"What am I supposed to do 
for this drink?" 

"Nothing. Nothing at all. I suppose I thought . . . just skip it. 
I'm lonesome, that's all." 

"Lonely, huh?" said the girl. 
"Lonely and just in, huh? Just 
in from space." She turned away 
from him to signal the bartender. 
"What you need is drinks." 

There were more drinks. Many 
more drinks. The girl kept them 
coming, kept talking to him about 
— what was it? Craig looked at 
the girl and then at the globe 
lamp. He watched as the tiny 
bright orbs of light projected 
their images on the girl opposite 
him. He was aware of the gradual dimming of the lights, the 
suppression of sound in the bar. 



SEA LEGS

He' watched the tiny lights of 
other globes appear around shadows, watched as the lights traced 
fiery trails across the dusky 
skin of the girl opposite him, 
watched as they crossed the 
warm, rounded flesh . . . 

"/ tell ya we didn't give him 
nothing but a coupla tazes." 

"The pump will determine that. 
You might as well tell the truth." 

"I am t elfin* the truth. He 
drank, let's see . . . two, three." 

"Four, five, six. Vou Jet her

"Hey, look, this guy's a spaceman, or was." 

"I didn't know that. Honest I 
didn't. He never told us." 

"All right, you didn't know. 
What you put in those tazes — 
ether?" 

"We denature the polyester just 
like the law says." 

"And you get it straight from 
M'cadii, eh?" 

"We put in some syn. So what? 
That ain't against the law." 

"He's probably got grav trouble. Chief." 

"Who was the girl?" 

"Girl? What girl?" 

"You know what girl!" 

"Just a girl, like a million of 
*cm these days." 

"Professional?" 

"There ain't any any more. 
You know, sensatia-tapes." 
**KiK3w her name?" 



*'T don't ask no names. How 
you going to know names? She's 
a girl. Just like ten million of 'em 
these days." 

"What you think a guy like 
this is doing here, Chief?" 

•'Why not?" 

"Well, look at /lis clothes. He'a 
got units, too. Can't figure thai 
out. She must've been after something else." 

"How about his clothing and 
food tickets?" 

"Uh . . . that's it. She got his 
tickets." 

"Come on, give me a hand. 
Lug him into the hold.'' 

THE hard face of the Civil Control chief peered down at him. 
It was a thick, red face that displayed no trace of feeling except 
perhaps toughness. It was long 
yet full, and it contained the 
proper features; but it added 
nothing of expression to the 
harsh, rasping voice. 

"First time in, eh? Or else Central's too damned lazy to check 
the file. Okay, I ain't going to 
cite you. Waste of time. But listen 
to me. You got problems, we 
got problems. You solve yours 
and don't come back here." 

Craig was aware of officers 
glowering at his back as he fumbled with the door button. The 
door opened onto a city street. 
It was entirely foreign to Craig. 
It was not a clean, straight thor

oughfare at the bottom of a canyon of towering white buildings 
and contrived but bright parks. 
It was an old street, a dirty 
street ; an incredible welter of 
color and line, of big and little 
shops, of dirty human shapes in 
drab gray. A flood of tone and 
noi se hit C ra i g as he e merge d 
from the station and descended 
the long, broad steps. 

Craig's head was in a whirl 
despite the strong dose of paraoxylnebutal he had taken in the 
station clinic. He felt closed in 
and befogged. He could remember almost nothing of the night 
in Civil Control. Even the clinic 
v/as fading from his memory. He 
was aware that he stank, that he 
was dirty, that his clothing clung 
to his body. He was miserable. 

He must call Import. He was 
due to begin work this morning, 
his period of personal adjustment 
complete. Instead, Craig turned 
end began to walk. He could not 
carry on a coherent conversation 
in his present state. He could 
never find his way unassisted 
back to his apartment; he was 
not even sure he remembered the 
address. But the thought of returning to his quarters, to Import 
sickened him. 

What was his address? East 7 I, 
North . . . No, that would be 
old lady Brockman. The association irritated him. He had completely forgotten the unwanted 



assignment, had forgotten to inquire where the address could be 
found. 

Craig became aware of the 
heavy flow of vehicular traffic 
that roared a scant eight fee', 
away. Large surface carrierr 
whistled in the nearest lane of 
the complex four-lane pattern. 
Then there were the private surface craft ; they were of many 
sizes and shapes. He guessed thai 
they were turbine-powered, but 
he could not identify the odor of 
their exhausts. 

There was an odd, unreal quality about the busy thoroughfare. 
Even myriad sounds from it were 
sounds he had never heard before and could not break down 
into thetr component parts. 

Craig became aware of other 
humans, many of them, 0:1 the 
sidewalk. Again they were of a 
class that he could not identify. 
They had none of the brisk, purposeful stride of those he had 
seen near Import. They lacked 
also the graceful, colorful dress. 
Their faces, so far as he could 
separate them from the blurring 
film over his eyes, were different. 

They seemed somehow looser 
faces, though Craig did not know 
exactly what he meant by the 
term. They were not tight, 
pinched, set, as were the faces 
he had seen before on Terra. 
There were bulbous noses, large 
ears, squint eyes, disheveled hair, 



SEA LEGS 



35 



the men's and women's faces 
strangely similar. Some were 
young, some old, but few were 
hard or fixed. They seemed more 
plastic, more full of expression 
than those he had come to know 
elsewhere in the city. He felt 
an inexplicable craving to know 
someone of this strange street. 

"You looking for something, 
mister?" asked a voice near him. 

Craig turned to find a middleaged man eying him from the 
doorway of an empty building. 
"I got it," the man added. 
"Got what?" Craig asked. 
"Anything a guy just outa the 
Can would want." 

"What would a *guy just outa 
the can* want that you have?" 
Craig examined the weathered, 
sharp face. It was an unpleasant 
one, but it belonged to this street; 
it would do to tell him what he 
wanted to know of the place. 

"Follow me." The man quickly 
inserted a magnikey into the door 
of the vacant store buildjng. 

"There's a station just up the 
Street," Craig warned. 
"Sure. So what?" 
The empty room was dusty and 
dark and received little light 
through the grimy display windows that faced on the street. 
What kind of store it had been, 
Craig could not guess. The man 
led him through a kind of storage 
room which was piled high with 
snoldy paper cartons and back to 



a rear door. With quick, dextrous 
movements, the man swung an 
ancient bar assembly and pushed 
open the rear door. It led to a 
litter-strewn yard enclosed by 
rough, eroded shacks and a 
wooden garage. 

They entered the garage 
through a creaking hinged door. 
It was a dank, almost completely 
dark room. Craig stumbled over 
something on the floor and fell 
against a packing box of some 
kind. 

"Just stand still." said the man. 
He was shuffling invisibly about 
in the darkness. Craig could hear 
him opening a kind of cabinet 
or drawer while saying in a steady 
monotone, "You got the right 
man, mister. My stuff is pure. 
You can test it. But you'd rather 
drink it, right?" 

For the tenth time, Craig asked 
himself why he had accepted the 
furtive invitation. The thought of 
this man's kind of intoxicant— 
however 'pure' — nauseated him. 
Nevertheless, he felt himself compelled by a kind of insatiable 
curiosity to follow out the part 
he had accepted. Perhaps through 
this man, through this somehow 
fascinating street, he could . . . 

"You got ten; I know that. 
Maybe you got more, huh?" the 
man interrupted his confused 
train of thought. 

"What makes you think I got 
ten?" Craig asked. He did not 



24 




 



know himself how many units 
his wallet contained — certainly 
not after the previous night. 

"Don't get sore. I'm honest. But 
I know you got ten. Otherwise 
you wouldn't have got out of the 
Station." 

The lack of clearly defined objects by which to orient himself 
in the darkness of the garage 
made his head begin to swim once 
more. He wanted to leave. 

"Don't get scared, buddy. They 
don't ever come in here." 

Craig fumbled for support in 
the darkness. He was afraid he 
would be sick. Fulfillment for the 
half-formed plan that was beginning to take shape in his mind 
would not come with the bootlegger. It would come into being 
somehow in the tawdry street he 
had just left, only he did not 
know how. 

"They don't really go after 
polyester. They don'J want to 
stop the stuff. It makes their 
job easier. You don't have to 
WQrry, buddy. Come on, how 
much you want? You might have 
trouble finding more for a while." 

Craig said nothing. He fumbled 
for a grip on a packing box. 

"You're from Out, aren't you, 
buddy? You ain't used to us 
here yet. Most of my customers 
ere^ from Out. What jam'd you 
get into?" 

"I got ten units, I think," Craig 
evaded. 



"It ain't none of my business 
what you done. Nobody around 
here is going to ask you any questions. Long as you got units, you 
get poly like the big shots that 
come over here all the way from 
Uptown." 

"Yeah," said Craig. "Gimme 
what I get for ten units and let's 
beat it out of here." 

"Myself, I never been Out. Not 
even Luna. Never wanted to. I 
stay here and have my little business — you can call it a business. 
You'll see, buddy, there are millions of guys like me. The controllers don't stop 'us. We're 
respectable. A damned sight more 
respectable than those . . ." 

"All right," snapped Craig. 
"Let's get out of here." 

"You got it bad, huh? This 
poly will fix that up. It's pure. 
You just come back to old Nave 
and get poly." 

"How . . . how you get out of 
here?" asked Craig, nauseated. 

"Get lost pretty easy in the 
dark, huh?" The man was beginning to mock him. 

Craig lashed out suddenly at 
the unseen face in the darkness. 
He caught the thin throat in his 
left hand. His right left the packing box and cocked to deliver a 
blow. But he began to fall and 
had to let go. 

"Okay, buddy, okay," the otlhef 
man said soothingly as Craig was 
forced to catch himself. "I like 



SEA IEGS 



17 



ex-spacemen. I Itnow lots of you. 
I sell you poly. You don't want 
to get tough with me." 

He shoved a block of ten smalt 
cubes into Craig*s hand and, 
while Craig fished for his wallet, 
he produced a tiny, narrowbeamed flash. The transaction 
was quickly over. The cube was 
small enough to be forced without much difficulty into Craig's 
jacket pocket. 

The man led him back across 
the tittered yard, through the 
empty store building, and out the 
front door. When Craig emerged 
onto the street once more, a uniformed figure was standing nearby. 

"He'll need two," whispered the 
man from behind him. 

Craig reached into his pocket 
and mechanically fumbled two of 
the small cubes of waxltke substance from the loose package. 
He placed them on the outstretched hand of the Civil Control officer. The officer did not 
look in his direction at any time, 
but accepted the offer and walked 
slowly on toward the station. 

Craig continued aimlessly 
down the long street. His head 
cleared as he walked and once 
more began to form a kind of 
vague plan. There was anonymity 
to a street such as this. There 
was also a kind of freedom. 
Everywhere in the universe, there 
were such stree ts. Neutralized 



streets, where a kind of compromise was reached between law 
and lawlessness. They were permitted because it was always 
necessary to provide such a place 
for those who were not permitted 
elsewhere. Those who would not 
fit, could not be "rehabilitated," 
could neither be jailed nor permitted complete freedom. 

Controllers of one kind or another patrolled such streets, keeping them in a kind of check — or, 
more accurately, in a kind of 
containment. But no amount of . 
control would ever completely 
stamp out the likes of Nave, the 
bootlegger. 

Perhaps here, on this street, 

Craig could be "lost." Here he 
might find security for a time in 
anonymity, security and time to 

find a way ... to what? He did 

not know. 

"Mister! Mister!" cried a thin, 

high voice from somewhere to 

his left. "Here, quick!" 

It was a young boy of perhaps 

nine or ten. Craig caught sight 

of him as he motioned urgently. 

He wore a shabby, torn version 

of what appeared to be a space 

service uniform. 

"I'm not buying anything, son." 

Craig said, pausing briefly. 

"Come here, quick!" insisted 

the boy, his eyes large in a dirty 

face. "You already bought too 

much." 

The boy was motioning him to

follow. He had stepped between 
two buildings. Craig approached 
him with suspicion. 

"What did you say?" 

"Slip in here quick! You 
bought from Nave the peddler. 
You bought poly, didn't ya?" 

"How did you . .. Craig 
began. 

"Tell you later. Slip through 
here quick or they'll send you to 
Hardy!" 

The genuine fear of the youngster conveyed itself to Craig. With 
effort he forced his body through 
the space between the old buildings. At first he did not intend 
to follow the boy, but only to 
stop him for an explanation. The 
boy, however, continued down the 
tight corridor formed by the 
buildings. 

"There's • window soon," he 
said from nhead of Craig. "Hurry. 
You lost timy with that peddler." 

Lost time? Cursing himself for 
becoming involved again in something he did not understand, 
Craig nevertheless followed as 
best he could. It was a tight 
squeeze and he found himself becoming breathless. 

"Dive down!" shouted the boy, 
looking back with terror in his 
eyes. 

Instinctively Craig did so. The 
rough walls tore at his suit. 

"Stop!" shouted a voice from 
behind Craig. "Stop or we fire!" 

Craig suddenly felt the sill of 



a window which opened into the 
building to his left. He quickly 
pulled himself into it. There was 
a sickening whine and a part of 
the window distingrated in a 
cloud of splinters and plaster. 

"Through here," said the boy 
from the semi -darkness. "They'll 
blast their way inside in a minute!" 

Craig found himself in another 
empty building. He followed the 
boy through a doorway and felt 
his way as he half ran along the 
dark hall. 

"Who are they?" he panted. 

"Controllers." 

"Civil Control?" 

"Sure. You must be pretty important. I didn't get it all. But 
they say the controllers checked 
up on you after . , . I'll explain 
later." 

The hall ended in a dim room 
piled high with plasmolite packing boxes in great disarray. The 
boy chose a box and lifted a lid. 

"Follow me. It's a passage." 

"Where to?" 

"No time now. Down here. 

The passage, which seemed to 
be constructed of plasmolite 
boxes, seemed somehow lit by 
daylight, although Craig could 
not actually see the source of 
the light. 

The tunnel ended in broad afternoon daylight. As he climbed 
out he saw a large clearing surrounded by ruins. 



SEA LEGS 



"We're just inside the old city," 
the boy said. ."We're safe now— 
unless those controllers are willing to take more chances than I 
think." 

"Wait a minute, son. You said 
'old city.' You mean that this is 
a part of pre-war Los Angeles?"" 

"Well, sure." 

"But that's supposed to be ... 

''Radioactive? Most of it, anyway. Good thing, too. Otherwise 
we'd have no place to go." 

"Look, kid, you better explain," 
said Craig,. "You were right about 
somebody being after me, but I 
don't get the 'we* business. Or 
how you knew all about this." 

"All right, mister, but let's get 
away from here. Those guys won't 
come through to here, even if they 
find a way — I don't think. But 
they're gettin* smarter and you're 
pretty hot right now." 

The boy led the way to what 
appeared to be a completely demolished building. 

"Used to be the old library," 
he said. 

They circled the heap of plaster, brick, and twisted steel. On 
the other side Craig saw what 
appeared to be a window. The 
boy let himself down through it. 

Craig was amazed to find a 
large, relatively clear area inside, 
probably part of an old room that 
had been spared by some freak of 
the blast. 

"You tivs here?" Craig asked 



the youngster incredulously. 

"Part of the time." The boy 
brought up an old crate and offered it to Craig as a chair. 
"Listen, mister, I don't know who 
you are. You're an ex-spaceman 
and that's enough for me." There 
was a slightly amusing attempt 
at adult hardness about him, 
"You shouldn't have wasted time 
with Nave. You should have got 
out of there." 

"Why?" 

"I don't know. What you done P 
anyway?" 

"I don't remember. Passed out 
at a bar . . ." 

The boy showed disgust. He 
glanced at the pocket which contained the polyester. 

Craig smiled. (£ I don't use this 
stuff. At least not enough to deserve what you're thinking." He 
tossed the remaining cubes on the 
littered floor of the room. 

The boy maintained his look 
of scorn for a time, but then 
softened. "I was afraid you got 
kicked out of the service for that." 

"How did you know I was ever 
in it?" 

"Easy. You don't know how 
to walk on a planet yet. Anybody 
can tell." 

"I didn't get kicked out," Craig 
said. "I came here to take a civil 
service job." 

"It'd almost be better if you 
had been." 

"I didn't know about Terra. 




 



None of us had any idea." 

"I know," said the boy sadly. 
"My father quit, too. He quit to 
marry my mother. That was before it was ... so bad." 

"Where — " Craig began, then 
bit off the question. 

"Oh, gee, mister, Terra's in en 
awful bad shape! They took . , . 
my parents. They hunt us down. 
They . . 

Craig approached the boy and 
put a hand on his shoulder. 
"What's your name, son?" 

"Phil." 

"Phil what?" 

"I don't know exactly. My father had to use so many names 
toward the . . . end. He once had 
only one name, but I guess even 
he forgot what it was." 

HpHEY prepared to spend the 
night in the old library room, 
but first Phil left it and made his 
way into the wilderness of rubble. 
He returned dragging a packing 
box of plastic insulating material, 
out of which they fashioned a 
crude bed. Despite the thousands 
of questions that paraded across 
Craig's mind, he waited each 
time for the boy to speak. 

"I can't take you any further 
until . . ." 

"Until you know more about 
me?" 

"In a way. They* It let me 
know." 

Craig would have risked much 



to identify the "they" Phil referred to, but he did not ask the 
question. As he watched the boy 
preparing the dimly lit room for 
ihe night, he felt sure Phil could 
be trusted. He was almost frightf ningly mature for his age. 

The room was well hidden, for 
the once great library lay in a 
powdered ruin about "it on all 
sides but a part of one. Only by 
accident or knowledge would a 
stranger recognize it in what was 
literally a world of rubble. During 
the moments of silence between 
Ihe boy's volunteered statements, 
Craig tried to visualize the awful 
catastrophe that had befallen the 
old city. Piles of powdered masonry restricted his view greatly 
under the gathering night. He 
could see a scant city block 
Ihrough the window, but he knew 
the wreckage around them must 
extend for miles. 

"You don't have to worry, mister . . ." 

"Craig." 

"Mr. Craig. They don't come 
in here at night." 

"Radioactivity?" 

"Yes. Not right here, but all 
around, everywhere." 

"What?" 

"It's all around us. You go 
through it to get here, but you 
can't stay anywhere but a few 
places like this." 

"How do you know all of these 
things, Phil?" 



SiA IEGS 



"Oh, we know, all right. We 
had to find out.'* 

"You must have ion counters,** 
he said in what he hoped was 
a casual tone. 

"We have lots of things." 
Craig was thoughtful for a minute. The boy was obviously on 
his guard now. 

"Those empty buildings?*' 
Craig asked tentatively. 

"They built them too close," 
said the boy. It seemed to be « 
safe subject. "They built them 
up as close as they thought was 
safe. Space is very valuable here. 
But they built them too close." 

"Yet the 'we' you speak of live 
even closer?" 

The boy bit his Hp and eyed 
him suspiciously in silence. 

"Look, kid,*' Craig said very 
deliberately, "I'm not a controller 
and I'm not interested in a bunch 
of petty thieves." 

The effect was just what he had 
intended. "We're not thieves !" 
And we're not traitors, either! 
We're . . " 

The boy was almost in tears. 
Craig waited a moment, then continued in a soft voice. "Phil, I'm 
just beginning to realize what a 
rotten place Terra is. From just 
what I've seen — it isn't very much 
—I can imagine such a system 
producing a great many 'we' 
groups like yours. I don't know 
who you are or what you are, 
hut you can't be any worse than 

32 



what I've already seen of Terran officials. Tell me, kid, what's 
it all about? And is there any way 
out of here? I mean — way out!" 

"You may tell him, Philip/' 
said a quiet voice from the window entrance. "Like us, Philip, 
Mr. Craig is an enemy of tyranny, 
though he doesn't realize it yet." 

Craig instinctively jumped 
back to get out of range of 
the window, meanwhile feeling 
around for something that could 
be used as a weapon. But the 
boy ran to the silhouetted figure 
in the window. 

"Mr. Sam!" he cried eagerly. 

Craig relaxed his hold on a 
strip of heavy metal. When the 
man had entered, the boy pulled 
a ragged black cloth across the 
window once more. He then ignited a small oil burning lamp 
in a carved-out nook in the wall. 

"It's all right, Philip, nobody 
is following me," the newcomer 
said. 

Craig studied his face. It was 
an old face covered by a stained 
gray beard. With a shock Craig 
recognized the man as a tramp 
he had seen earlier on the street, 
napping, sprawled in a doorway. 
Now for the first time he saw the 
eyes. Sharp and clear, they 
caught up the yellow light of the 
oil lamp and glowed warmly as 
they turned to Craig. 

"I am 'Mr. Sam,* Mr. Craig. 
You might know me by the full 

; A L A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



name, Samuel Cocteau, but I 
doubt it. Even the names of the 
infamous do not penetrate space." 

"I guess not," Craig agreed. 
"But you said something about 
my being an enemy of tyranny." 

"Whether you like it at once 
or not, you are temporarily one 
of us — one of the 'we' Philip has 
been speaking of. But all of that 
in due time. Right now it is necessary for us to leave here." , 

"They're going to try to find 
us tonight?" asked Phil, startled. 

"Yes, a tribute to Mr. Craig," 
said the old man. "A Geiger team 
is being readied at the station." 

Craig started to protest as the 
boy began hurriedly to pick up 
his few possessions in the room. 

"I'm sorry, Mr. Craig," the 
man said. "I must ask you to 
decide now whether to trust us 
and our judgment. There is grave 
danger for you if you are caught 
by the Civil Control. The report 
I have received is that you are 
largely unaware of the 'crimes 
against the state' you have committed. The Civil Control hoped 
to capture you before you find 
them out. But that, of course, is 
my word only. There is no time 
to give you proof, even if I had 
it." 

Craig's mind whirled under the 
sudden onslaught of new facts. He 
had followed a peddler without 
knowing why he did it. He had 
bought polyester he had no use 



for. He had followed a boy who 
beckoned to him. Now — how 
much longer was he to move haphazardly through Terra like a 
cork on a wind-blown sea? Whq 
were these strange fugitives who 
said he was one of them and who 
lived in the heart of a radioactive 
city? 

"Well, Mr. Craig?" asked Cocteau quietly. 

Craig glanced at the boy. The 
child's eyes were wide and pleading in the dim light of the oil 
lamp. 

"Let's go," Craig said. 

"p^ARKNESS was swiftly falling 
on the wilderness of heaping 
ruin. The three made their way 
toward what Craig at first 
thought was an unbroken wall of 
rubble. The near-horizontal rays 
of the sun tipped the white mass 
of broken stone with brilliance, 
and gave the entire scene an unearthly quality. Below the towering rubble mountains, long black 
shadows were reaching toward 
what Craig knew to be the living 
city. 

Cocteau took the lead nod set 
a fast pace for a man of hi* m*e. 
He took a highly deviou-; p Uh

difficult and that outlined them 
against the bright western sky. 
At one point Craig left the invisible path of the older man to

33 



avoid an exhaustingly steep rise. 

"Follow me exactly," warned 
Cocteau in a sharp voice. "There 
is only one relatively safe patli 
through here." 

"They'll see us against the 
Sky!" 

*'It cannot be helped." 
But there was no indication 
that they were followed. They 
pushed onwaTd, scurrying over 
heaps of weathered plaster and 
brick. The old man seemed to 
avoid with great care places 
where metal girders were visible. 

The exertion together with 
walking directly into the setting 
sun made Craig begin to feel the 
old nausea return. He resisted it 
for a time, but it would not be 
repressed, particularly as he 
strove to maintain his balance 
on difficult climbs. Once he stumbled on a splintered building 
Stone and fell. It was a long minute before he could regain his 
feet and mutter a feeble, "Sorry." 

"We must push on, Mr. Craig," 
was Cocteau's only comment. 

"It's safe here for a minute, 
isn't it?" Craig panted, dizzy and 
breathless. 

"There is no Safe place here, 
Mr. Craig." 

They continued their winding 
way through the growing darkness. For Craig it became a nightmare of stumbling over the endless piles of sharp stones. His 
mind spun sickeningly and he 



retched as he half ran along the 
path Cocteau set for them. 

"Please, mister," breathed the 
voice of Ph il behind him . "It 
isn't so far now." 

Doggedness carried Craig onward long after awareness left 
him. 

¥¥E became conscious suddenly, 
as though by an injection of 
stimulant. He found himself surrounded by a number of figures, 
including Cocteau and a white 
garbed man, evidently a doctor. 

"You are quite safe now, Mr. 
Craig," said Cocteau warmly. 
"Welcome to the City of We" 

"Where are we?" 

"Deep in the old city, in a place 
where the radioactivity is negligible," the man answered as the 
doctor took his pulse. "This is 
Dr. Grant and these others are 
members of the Liberty party." 

"Liberty!" 

"You've heard of it?" 

"Yeah, you're pretty unpopular, aren't you?" 

"Unpopular? Let us say that 
all of Terran officialdom is dedicated to exterminating us." 

"The committee on somethingor-other asked me about my attitudes toward the Liberty party." 
said Craig, rising to a sitting position on the cot. 

"And at the time you had a 
lack of attitude, which most likely 
was unacceptable to them," sup



 



plied Cocteau, smiling. "Well, 
you may be interested to know 
that you are considered one of us 
by most of Terra just now." 
"What?" 

"That is correct," said another 
of the group. "It seems you were 
in a bar in — ah — in a somewhat 
less than fully conscious state . . ." 

"But I didn't know anything 
about the Liberty party." 

"No, nor is it alleged that you 
actually mentioned the party in 
so many words," continued the 
white-haired man, smiling. "But 
it seems that you did make certain statements in the presence 
of certain persons that did indicate a definite predilection . . ." 

"That's crazy," said Craig angrily. 

"Of course," Cocteau agreed. 

"Furthermore," the other man 
said, "you are charged with wilful abandonment of duty and 
'acts indicative of your desire to 
sfiun the best utilization of your 
talents in behalf of the state of 
Terra.* " 

"In other words," explained 
Cocteau, "you applied for a job 
on a private space freighter. 
Without permission to do so." 

Craig was silent. He lay back 
down on the cot and tried to 
absorb the data he had just received. 

"So I'm accused of belonging 
to something I don't know anything about?" 



"Then HI tell you briefly about 
us. You have a right to know 
the magnitude of the crime with 
which you are charged." Cocteau 
took a seat by Craig's cot. The 
others also found chairs. 

"But first a brief bit of history 
— a history that you have never 
heard before. Not your fault. It 
is not allowed to penetrate Terra's 
atmosphere." 

"I don't know much about 
Terra," Craig interjected. "I'm 
just finding out how much I don't 
know." 

"God, I wish the rest of the 
Universe could find out with 
you!" said one of the group. 

"Yes, the history of Terra is 
almost lost now. That is, the part 
of it that followed the Great Wars 
of seventy-five years ago. You 
know of those wars; you have just 
walked through one of the physical results of them. No nation or 
alliance of nations can be said 
to have won them, but the wars 
had a most profound effect upon 
Terra. More than Anything else, 
they made men reach to the stars, 
if only to escape the deadly conflicts of Terra. 

"Ideological issues were involved, naturally, but the underlying cause of the Great Wars 
was the struggle for power. The 
world was disunited. Peoples were 
divided from peoples by an almost inconceivable number of unimportant distinctions. These 



SEA LEGS 



35 



were ethnical, national, racial, 
cultural — name any brand of 
prejudice and you'll find it existed then. 

"Incredibly enough, the destructiveness of the Great Wars 
accomplished a kind of unity. 
Gone were the once proud aggressive nations. Gone into oblivion. Gone, too, were the 
systems of economics and sociology of which men were once 
so sure. There was a kind of 
'plague -on -both -your -houses' attitude among the peoples of the 
world. There was a large measure of ■ anarchy following the 
Great Wars. Not a violent, active 
anarchy of hate and terror, but 
of apathy and weariness. Apathy 
at the outcome of false conflicts, 
and weariness of the self-defeating strife of man against man. 

"At first men produced by the 
full extent of their labors barely 
enough on which to survive. Only 
gradually did they regain their 
ability to produce surpluses once 
more. Of course, surpluses mean 
exchanges — trade. And trade requires order and system. 

"The first ten years following 
the Great Wars was a period of 
gradualism in all things. Peoples 
united in small groups. There 
were no political or racial divisions. The units were built upon 
functional lines. They were natural and free. Above all, they 
were cooperative. 



"It wai not communism. Men 
knew all too well the mental and 
physical slavery of that brutally 
rigid system. It was not rugged 
individualism either. Rugged individuals during this period 
cither starved or were driven out 
by the starving. 

"This natural, cooperative 
unity spread and became more 
complex. There came into being 
natural associations of units. Not 
exclusive but inclusive associations that linked all who would 
join and could produce surpluses. 
Productivity increased thereby. 
Men were intelligent enough t» 
avoid many of the old abuses. 

"Ways were found to harness 
the productivity of each man and 
woman. Genuine efforts were 
made to avoid misfits, to make 
those who produced fit. It was 
realized, Mr. Craig, that the unhappy man will infect others with. 
his misery, and the trouble he 
will cause is much more difficult 
to undo than to prevent in the 
first place. 

"There were, of course, mistakes, false starts. But the newfound system of world-wide unity, 
proved flexible. It was multiplebased. To a very large degree, all 
men fitted into it logically and 
naturally. It was the first truly 
*grass-roots* economic and social 
system in the history of man. 
And it was a great tribute to his 
ability to work out his destiny. 




 



particularly since it came after 
a tragedy that was so enormous 
and devastating. 

"The list -of its successes is incredible. For in a decade the ageold problem of poverty seemed 
to have disappeared. There were 
no significant outbreaks of disorder and lawlessness — indeed, 
there was comparatively little 
need for a written law. The principle of mutuality and cooperation was too strongly conditioned 
into the people. 

"Scientifically, the first half of 
the new century, a scant twentyfive years after the last bomb 
was dropped, was the greatest in 
man's history. Man reached the 
stars. He began to know the molecule, the atom, the electron. He 
pushed the frontier of his knowledge deep into both microcosm 
and macrocosm. 

"But a fatal flaw had long before developed in the structure, 
wonderful as it was. It was an 
age-old flaw. It was one that was 
disguised by the very nature of 
the new system. When it was 
recognized, that flaw had so 
weakened the system that its 
spread was all but inevitable. It 
is a flaw that will always plague 
man to a certain extent, but one 
that must keep us eternally vigilant. 

"It is this: the greatest human 
good comes not in how well you 
learn to control man and keep 



him froni harming himself. What 
determines it is how completely 
you learn to free hint. 

"Conversely, the law provides 
that no control system, however 
devised, will succeed, in bringing 
happiness and security to man 
to any greater extent than it permits the fullest expression of his 
nature. 

"Man is inherently good. He 
will always choose a moral path 
when free to do so. He strives 
for justice and truth both as an 
individual and in mass. 

"Mr. Craig, democracy is man's 
greatest a priori. Yet based upon 
a law of restraint, it cannot escape the hopeless contradiction 
that leads to its own destruction. 
Man can democratically do the 
irrational and the insane. He can 
democratically limit and coerce 
the absolute highest nature of 
himself. Bad laws are forever 
passed to achieve good ends. But 
each new law produces new criminals while the cause of the new 
crime remains unsolved. 

"Ergo, the world you have just 
seen. Ergo, the Liberty party. Mr. 
Craig, our world is ruled by a 
vast and horrible bureaucracy 
whose terrible weapon is conformity. You would find few laws 
even today written in books. Our 
assemblies pass few statutes. 
They determine dogma instead. 
They 'resolve' and 'move.' They

It had been a long speech. 
Craig had listened in awe, for it 
was a completely new story to 
him. 

"And you propose to destroy 
this bureaucracy?" he said. 

"In so far as it is a philosophical entity, yes." 

"And you say I am one of you 
now?" 

"You are considered one of us. 
Your employer and his secretary 
are also suspected.*' 

"But I'm entitled to a trial, or 
at least a hearing.'* 

"Not now, Mr. Craig. It would 
do you little good, anyway. The 
'position' of the Assembly on subversion is that it 'rightly behooves 
every loyal Terran so to conduct 
his behavior that a suspicion of 
membership in the Liberty party 
is unthinkable.' " 

Craig found himself regretting 




38 




 



I've seen plenty of that bureaucracy and there seems to be 
damned little freedom of action 
left on Terra. But how do I know 
you can do any better when you 
get in power?" 

-"Liberty will never be 'in 
power,' Mr. Craig," Cocteau said 
quietly. "Liberty wjll attempt to 
reach the minds of the people 
with our message of hope, of 
freedom in true democracy." 

Another of the group joined 
Cocteau. "We are now hunted as 
criminals. We have only this 
small stronghold in the old city." 



"We shall attempt only to gain 
entry to the minds of the people," 
said Cocteau. "Gain entry to tell 
them how they live, for most of 
them have had no contact with 
any other kind of life." 

"It would mean killing a few 
people," Craig pointed out. 

"One of the basic principles of 
Liberty is the inherent goodness 
of every man," Cocteau repeated. 
"We have never taken a life, even 
in self-defense. We shall never 
take one. Nor will it , ever be 
necessary for a member of the 
Liberty party to hold public of




fice, to own a weapon, to coerce 
a man in any physical way." 

"But you will coerce them with 
ideas. Is that what you have in 
mind?" Craig protested. 

"If a point of view, a promise, 
3 goal is coercion, then the answer to your question is yes. But 
ideas are not dangerous when a 
man is free to argue and act 
against them." 

"Look here, Cocteau," Craig 
said earnestly, "all you say may 
be true. I believe it is. But what 
can I do? I'm a spaceman, or 
at best an apprentice import clerk. 
I don't know anything about this 
sort of work." 

"Come here a moment," invited 
a member of the group. 

Through the window indicated 
by the man, Craig saw an incredible sight. The entire scene 
seemed to be on the inside of a 
vast underground cavern. There 
were other buildings and some 
kind of systematic work being 
done by many men and women. 
But the thing that caught Craig's 
eye seemed to be cradled in a 
kind of hangar. 

. "A spaceship!" exclaimed 
Craig. 

"A very modest one, yet not 
so modest when you consider that 
it was necessary to carry in every 
single piece and part by hand." 

"Good Lord!" 

"You, Mr. Craig, might captain that ship. Very few Terrans 



have ever even flown in one. It 
will be necessary to establish contact with possible assistance outside of Terra. You can make that 
possible." 

Craig was thoughtful, "I suppose, now that I've seen all this, 
you can't let me leave here unless 
I join you." 

"No," denied Cocteau. "You 
may leave here any time you 
like." 

"I'd be sure to get caught, of 
course . . ." 

"Within limits, it might be possible to help you avoid capture." 
Cocteau reached into his beggar's 
coat and withdrew a wallet. 
"Identity card, food ration, 
clothing, work card, even a Government party card. It's all here, 
Mr. Craig. You could have a 
slightly altered physical appearance. Liberty accepts no unwilling members. You are given as 
nearly a free choice in this matter 
as is possible to give you." 

"Suppose I talked?" asked 
Craig, nodding bluntly toward 
the port. 

Cocteau smiled. "It was necessary to prepare for that. You 
were given a drug. It has not affected your thinking capacity in 
any way. But once it wears off, 
you will be unable to remember 
what took place while under its 
influence. 

"When agents of the Liberty 
party are sent out of here, they

go having had all experience with 
Liberty take place while under 
the drug. None of us could remember for more than a few 
hours the exact location of this 
headquarters. When it is necessary to leave for very long, we 
carry a small amount of the 
drug with us. Many of our agents 
have been caught and a few have 
resigned. But none has divulged 
enough information to harm us 
seriously." 

Craig was postponing his decision to the last. "They must 
know you're somewhere in here. 
If the radioactivity keeps them 
out, why shouldn't they put a 
cordon around the entire old 
city ?" 

"Periodically, they try. But 
there are many, many other ways 
of leaving here than by the surface. Underground water conduits, ancient power and sewer 
lines, a number of tunnels we 
have dug . . 

Craig was solemnly handed the 
wallet. 

"If you will submit to sufficient 
plastic surgery to make you resemble this man, you may safely 
leave here no later than tomorrow 
night." 

A long silence ensued. It was 
Interrupted by a noise from outside the door of the room. It was 
the voice of Phil. 

"Has he decided to stay? Did 
you see him? He looks like my 



daddy did . . . Will he stay?'* 
"You mustn't interrupt, son. 

They're in conference now. We'll 

let you know.** 

"Tell him yes!" said Craig in 

a loud voice. "Tell him hell, yes, 

I'm staying!" 

The men gathered around htm 

to congratulate him on the decision. 

Phil was allowed in the clinic 
to join them. 

"Oh, Cocteau, one more thing," 
Craig said.. 
'."Yes?" 

Craig was fumbling for his own 
wallet. He extracted a folded 
card. j v 

"Where would East 71, North 
101, Number 4 be?" 

"It would have been somewhere 
here in Old City." 

"God! How did the old guy 
expect me to deliver this message? Old man named Brockman. 
He sent me a message just before 
he died in Gravitation. I was to 
visit his wife." 

"Brockman?" asked Cocteau. 
"You mean Ethel Brockman?" 

"Yeah. How'd you know?" 

"Ethel Brockman was one of 
the organizers of the Liberty 
party. She served as its chairman 
until her death only a few years 
ago. Her husband must have felt 
your 'sea legs* would lead you to 
us eventually. And, of course, 
they did." .
