Manners of the Age By H. B. FYFE 

THE red tennis robot scooted desperately across the 
court, its four wide -set 
wheels squealing. For a moment, 
Robert's hard- hit passing shot 
seemed to have scored. Then, at 
the last instant, the robot whipped around its single racketequipped arm. Robert sprawled 
headlong in a futile lunge at the 
return. 

"Game and set to Red Three," 
announced the referee box from 
its high station above the net. 

"Ah, shut up!" growled Robert, 
and flung down his racket for one 
of the white serving robots to 
retrieve. 



"Yes, Robert," agreed the voice. 
"Will Robert continue to play?" 
Interpreting the man's savage 
mumble as a negative, it told his 
opponent, "Return to your stall, 
Red Three!" 

Robert strode off wordlessly toward the house. Reaching the 
hundred - foot - square swimming 
pool, he hesitated uncertainly. 

"Weather's so damned hot," he 
muttered. "Why didn't the oldtime scientists find out how to do 
something about that while there 
were still enough people on Earth 
to manage it?" 

He stripped off his damp clothing and dropped it on the "beach"

of white sand. Behind him sounded the steps of a humanoid serving robot, hastening to pick it up. 
Robert plunged deep into the 
cooling water and let himself float 
lazily to the surface. 

Maybe they did, he thought. / 
could send a robot over to the old 
eity library for information. Still, 
actually doing anything would 
probably take the resources of a 
good many persons — ana* if /sn'f 
so easy to find people now that 
Earth is practically deserted. 

He rolled sideward for a breath 
and began to swim slowly for the 
opposite side of the pool, reflecting upon the curious culture of 
the planet. Although he had accepted this all his life, it really 
was remarkable how the original 
home of the human race had been 
forsaken for fresher worlds among 
the stars. Or was it more remarkable that a few individuals had 
asserted their independence by 
remaining? 

Robert was aware that the decision involved few difficulties, 
considering the wealth of robots 
and other automatic machines. 
He regretted knowing so few humans, though they were really not 
necessary. If not for his hobby of 
televising, he would probably not 
knew any at all. 

"Wonder how far past the old 
city I'd have to go to meet someone in person," he murmured as 
he pulled himself from the pool. 



"Maybe I ought to try accepting 
that televised invitation of the 
other night." 

OEVERAL dark usuform robots 
*^ were smoothing the ~sand on 
this beach under the direction of 
a blue humanoid superviser. 
Watching them idly, Robert estimated that it must be ten years 
since he had seen another human 
face to face. His parents were 
dim memories. He got along very 
well, however, witb robots to 
serve him or to obtain occasional 
information from the automatic 
scanners of the city library that 
had long ago been equipped to 
serve such a purpose. 

"Much better than things were 
in the old days," he told himself 
as he crossed the lawn to his 
sprawling white mansion. "Must 
have been awful before the population declined. Imagine having 
people all around you, having to 
listen to them, see them, and 
argue to make them do what you 
wanted V 

The heel of his bare right foot 
came down heavily on a pebble, 
and he swore without awareness 
of the precise meaning of the ancient phrases. He limped into the 
baths and beckoned a waiting 
robot as he stretched out on a 
rubbing table. 

"Call Blue One!'* he ordered. 

The red robot pushed a button 
on the wall before beginning the 




 



massage. In a few moments, the 
major-domo arrived. 

"Did Robert enjoy the tennis?" 
it inquired politely. 

"I did not!" snapped the man. 
"Red Three won — and by too big 
a score. Have it geared down a 
few feet per second." 

"Yes, Robert." 

"And have the lawn screened 
again for pebbles!" 

As Blue One retired he relaxed, 
and turned his mind to ideas for 
filling the evening. He hoped 
Henry would televise; Robert had 
news for him. 

After a short nap and dinner, 
he took the elevator to his threcstory tower and turned on the 
television robot. Seating himself 
in a comfortable armchair, he directed the machine from one 
channel to another. For some 
time, there was no answer to his 
perfunctory call signals, but one 
of his few acquaintances finally 
came on. 

"Jack here," said a quiet voice 
that Robert had long suspected 
of being disguised by a filter 
microphone. 

"I haven't heard you for some 
weeks," he remarked, eying the 
swirling colors on the screen. 

He disliked Jack for never 
showing his face, but curiosity as 
to what lay behind the mechanical image projected by the other's 
transmitter preserved the acquaintance. 



"I was . . . busy," said the bodiless voice, with a discreet hint of 
a chuckle that Robert found 
chilling. 

He wondered what Jack had 
been up to. He remembered once 
being favored with a televised 
view of Jack's favorite sport — a 
battle between companies of 
robots designed for the purpose, 
horribly reminiscent of human 
conflicts Robert had seen on historical films. 

TTK soon made an excuse to 
■H break off and set the robot to 
scanning Henry's channel. He had 
something to tell the older man, 
who lived only about a hundred 
miles away and was as close to 
be ing his friend as was possible in 
this age of scattered, self-sufficient dwellings. 

"I don't mind talking to him" 
Robert reflected. "At least he 
doesn't overdo this business of 
individual privacy." 

He thought briefly of the disdainful face — seemingly on a distant station — which had merely 
examined him for several minutes 
one night without ever condescending to speak. Recalling his 
rage at this treatment, Robert 
wondered how the ancients had 
managed to get along together 
when there were so many of them. 
They must have had some strict 
code of behavior, he supposed, 
or they never would have bred 



MANNERS OF THE ACL

so enormous a population. 

"I must find out about that 
someday," he decided. "How did 
you act, for instance, if you 
wanted to play tennis but someone else just refused and went to 
eat dinner? Maybe that was why 
the ancients had so many murders." 

He noticed that the robot was 
getting an answer from Henry's 
station, and was pleased. He 
could talk as long as he liked, 
knowing Henry would not resent 
his cutting off any time he became 
bored with the conversation. 

piHE robot focused the image 
* smoothly. "Henry gave the impression of being a small man. 
He was gray and wrinkled compared with Robert, but his black 
eyes were alertly sharp. He smiled 
his greeting and immediately 
launched into a story of one of 
his youthful trips through the 
mountains, from the point at 
which it had been interrupted the 
last time they had talked. 

Robert listened impatiently. 

"Maybe I have some interesting 
news," he remarked as the other 
finished. "I picked up a new station the other night." 

"That reminds me of a time 
■> ' n I was a boy and — ** 

Robert fidgeted while Henry 
described watching his father 
build a spare television set as a 
hobby, with only a minimum of 



robot help. He pounced upon the 
first pause. 

"A new station?" he repeated. 
"Came in very well, too. I can't 
imagine why I never picked it up 
before." * 

"Distant, perhaps?" asked Henry resignedly. 

"No, not very far from me, as 
a matter of fact." 

"You can't always tell, especially with the ocean so close. 
Now that there arc so few people, 
you'd think there'd be land 
enough for all of them; but' a 
good many spend all their lives 
aboard ship-robots." 

"Not this one," said Robert. 
"She even showed me an outside 
view of her home." 

Henry's eyebrows rose. "She? 
A woman?"' 

"Her name is Marcia-Joan." 

"Well, well," said Henry. "Imagine that. Women, as I recall, 
usually do have funny names." 

He gazed thoughtfully at his 
well-kept hands. 

"Did I ever tell you about the 
last woman I knew?" he asked. 
^ "About twenty years ago. We had 
a son, you know, but he grew up 
and wanted his own home and 
robots." 

"Natural enough," Robert commented, somewhat briefly since 
Henry had told him the story before. 

"I often wonder what became 
of him," mused the older man. 



• A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



"That's the trouble with what's 
left of Earth culture— no families 
any more." 

Now he'll tell about the time he 
lived in a crowd of five, thought 
Robert. He, his wife, their boy 
and the visiting couple with the 
fleet of robot helicopters. 

Deciding that Henry could 
reminisce just as well without a 
listener, Robert quietly ordered 
the robot to turn itself off. 

Maybe I wilt make the trip, 
he pondered, on the way downStairs, if only to see what it's tike 
with another person about. 

At about noon of the second 
day after that, he remembered 
that thought with regret. 

The ancient roads, seldom used 
and never repaired, were rough 
and bumpy. Having no flying 
robots, Robert was compelled to 
transport himself and a few mechanical servants in ground vehicles. He had — idiotically, he 
now realized — started with the 
dawn, and was already tired. 

Consequently, he was perhaps 
unduly annoyed when two tiny 
spy-eyes flew down from the hills 
to hover above his caravan on 
whirring little piope^prs. He tried 
to glance up pleasantly while 
their lenses televised pictures to 
their base, but he feared that his 
smile was strained. 

The spy-eyes retired after a 
few minutes. Robert's vehicle, at 
his voiced order, turned onto a 



road leading between two forested hills. 

Right there, he thought four 
hours later, was where I made my 
mistake. I should hdve turned 
back and gone home! 

He stood in the doorway of a 
small cottage of pale blue trimmed with yellow, watching his 
robots unload baggage. They were 
supervised by Blue Two, the spare 
for Blue One. 

A LSO watching, as silently as 
Robert, was a pink-and-blue 
striped robot which had guided 
the caravan from the entrance 
gate to the cottage. After one 
confused protest in a curiously 
high voice, it had not spoken. 

M aybe we shouldn't have 
driven through that flower bed, 
thought Robert. Stilt, the thing 
ought to be versatile enough to 
say so. / wouldn't have such a 
gimerack contraption! 

He looked up as another humanoid robot in similar colors 
approached along the line of 
shrubs separating the main lawns 
from that surrounding the cottage. . 

"Marcia-Joan has finished her 
nap. You may come to the house 
now." 

Robert's jaw hung slack as he 
sought for a reply. His face 
flushed at the idea of a robot's offering fcfm permission to enter the 
house. 



MANNERS OF THE AGE 



43 



Nevertheless, he followed it 
across the wide lawn and between 
banks of gaily blossoming flowers to the main house. Robert was 
not sure which color scheme he 
disliked more, that of the robot or 
the unemphatic pastel tints of the 
house. 

The robot led the way inside 
end along a hall. It pulled back 
a curtain near the other end, revealing a room with furniture for 
human use. Robert stared at the 
girl who sat in an armchair, clad 
in a long robe of soft, pink material. 

She looked a few years younger 
than he. Her hair and eyes were 
also brown, though darker. In 
contrast to Robert's, her smooth 
skin was only lightly tanned, and 
she wore her hair much longer. 
He thought her oval face might 
have been pleasant if not for the 
analytical expression she wore. 

"I am quite human," he said 
in annoyance. "Do you have a 
voice?" 

She rose and walked over to 
him curiously. Robert saw that 
she was several inches shorter 
than he, about the height of one 
of his robots. He condescended to 
bear her scrutiny. 

"You look just as you do on 
the telescreen," she marveled. 

Robert began to wonder if the 
girl were feebleminded. How else 
should he look? 

**I usually swim at this hour," 



he said to change the subject 
"Where is the pool?" 

Marcia-Joan stared at him. 

"Pool of what?" she asked. 

Sensing sarcasm, he scowled. 
"Pool of water, of course ! To 
swim in. What did you think I 
meant — a pool of oil?" 

"I am not acquainted with your 
habits," retorted the girl. 

"None of that stupid wit!" he 
snapped. "Where is the pool?" 

"Don't shout!" shouted the girl. 
Her voice was high and unpleasantly shrill compared with his. 
"I don't have a pool. Who wants 
a swimming pool, anyway?" 

Robert felt his face flushing 
with rage. 

So she won't tell me! he 
thought. All right, I'll find it myself. Everybody has a pool. And 
if she comes in, I'll hold her head 
under for a while! 

Sneering, he turned toward the 
nearest exit from the house. The 
gaily striped robot hastened after 
him. 

THE door failed to swing back 
as it should have at Robert's 
approach. Impatiently, he seized 
the ornamental handle. He felt 
his shoulder grasped by a metal 
hand. 

"Do not use the front doorl" 
said the robot. 

"Let go!" ordered Robert, incensed that any robot should presume to hinder him. 




 



"Only Marcia-Joan uses this 
door," said the robot, ignoring 
Robert's displeasure. 

"I'll use it if I tike!" declared 
Robert, jerking the handle. 

The next moment, he was lifted 
bodily into the air. By the time 
he realized what was happening, 
he was carried, face down, along 
the halt. Too astonished even to 
yell, he caught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's tiny feet beneath the 
hem of her pink robe as his head 
passed \hc curtained doorway. 

The robot clumped on to the 
door at the rear of the house and 
out into the sunshine. There, it 
released its grip, 

When Robert regained the 
breath knocked out of him by the 
drop, and assured himself that 
no bones were broken, his anger 
returned. 

"I'll find it. wherever it is!" he 
growled, and set out to search 
the grounds. 

About twenty minutes later, 
he was forced to admit that there 
really was no swimming pool. Except for a brook fifty yards away, 
there was only the tiled bathroom 
of the cottage to bathe in. 

"Primitive!" exclaimed Robert, 
eying this. "Manually operated 
water supply, too! I must have 
the robots fix something better 
for tomorrow." 

Since none of his robots was 
equipped with a thermometer, he 
had to draw the bath himself. 




Meanwhile, he gave orders t» 
Blue Two regarding the brook 
and a place to swim. He managed 
to fill the tub without scalding; 
himself mainly because there was 
no hot water. His irritation, by 
the time he had dressed in fresh 
clothes and prepared for another 
talk with his hostess, was still 
lively. 

"Ah, you return?" Marcia-Joaa 
commented from a window above 
the back door. 

"It is time to eat," said Robert 
frankly. 

"You are mistaken." 

He glanced at the sunset, which 
was already fading. 

"It is time," he isjsisted. "I always eat at this hour." 

"Well. I don't." 

Robert leaned back to examine 
her expression more carefully. He 
felt very much the way he had 
the day the water-supply robot 
for his pool had broken down 
and, despite Robert's bellowed 
orders, had flooded a good part 
of the lawn before Blue One had 
disconnected it Some instinct 
warned him. moreover, that bellowing now would be as useless 
as it had been then. 

"What do you do now?" he 
asked. 

"I dress for the evening." 
"And when do you eat?'' 
"After I finish dressing." 
"I'll wait for you," said Robert, 
feeling that that much tolerance 



MANNERS OF THE AGE 



45 



could do no particular harm. 

He encountered the pink-andblue robot in the hall, superintending several plain yellow ones 
bearing dishes and covered platters. Robert followed them to a 
dining room. 

"Marcia-Joan sits there," the 
major-domo informed him as he 
moved toward the only chair at 
the table. 

TJOBERT warily retreated to 
■■'•the opposite side of the table 
and looked for another chair. 
None was visible. 

Of course, he thought, trying 
to be fair. Why should anybody 
in this day have more than one 
chair? Robots don't sit. 

He waited for the major-domo 
to leave, but it did not. The serving robots finished laying out the 
dishes and retired to posts along 
the wall. Finally, Robert decided 
that he would have to make his 
status clear or risk going hungry. 

// / sit down somewhere, he 
decided, it may recognize me as 
human. What a stupid machine 
to have! 

He started around the end of 
the table again, but the striped 
robot moved to intercept him. 
Robert stopped. 

"Oh, well," he sighed, sitting 
side wise on a corner of the table. 

The robot hesitated, made one 
or two false starts in different directions, then halted. The situa


tion had apparently not been included among its memory tapes. 
Robert grinned and lifted the 

cover of the nearest platter. 

He managed to eat, despite his 
ungraceful position and what he 
considered the scarcity of the 
food. Just as he finished the last 
dish, he heard footsteps in the 
hall. 

Marcia-Joan had dressed in a 
fiesh robe, of crimson. Its thinner 
material was gathered at the 
waist by clasps of gleaming gold. 
The arrangement emphasized 
bodily contours Robert had previously seen only in historical 
films. 

He became aware that she was 
regarding him with much the 
same suggestion of helpless dismay as the major-domo. 

"Why. you've eaten it all!" she 
exclaimed. 

"All?" snorted Robert. "There 
was hardly any food!" 

Marcia-Joan walked slowly 
around the table, staring at the 
empty dishes. 

"A few bits of raw vegetables 
and the tiniest portion of proteinconcentrate I ever saw!" Robert 
continued. ""Do you call that a 
dinner to serve a guest?" 

"And I especially ordered two 
portions — " 

"Two?" Robert repeated in astonishment. "You must visit me 
sometime. I'll show you — " 

"What's the matter with my 




 



food?" interrupted the girl! "I follow the best diet advice my robots 
could find in the city library.** 

"They should have looked for 
human diets, not song-birds'.*' 

He lifted a cover in hopes of 
finding some overlooked morsel, 
but the platter was bare. 

"No wonder you act so strangely,", he said. "You must be sufj fermg from malnutrition. I don't 
wonder with a skimpy diet like 
this." 

"It's very healthful," insisted 
Marcia-Joan. "The old film said 
it was good for the figure, too.** 

"Not interested," grunted Robert. "I'm satisfied as I am." 

"Oh, yes? You look gawky to 
me." • 

"You don't," retorted Robert, 
examining her disdainfully. "You 
are short and stubby and too 
plump." 

"Plump?" 

"Worse, you're actually fat in 
lots of places I'm not." 

"At least not between the ears!" 

Robert blinked. 

"Wh-wh-WHAT?" 

"And besides," she stormed on, 
"those robots you brought are 
painted the most repulsive 
colors!" 

TJOBERT closed his mouth and 
silently sought the connection. 

Robots? he thought. Not fat, 
but repulsive colors, she said. 



What haatihat to do with food? 
The woman seems incapable ol 
togic. 

"And furthermore," MarciaJoan was saying, "I'm not sure I 
care for the looks of you! Lulu, 
put him out!" 

"Who's Lulu?" demanded Robert. 

Then, as the major-domo 
moved forward, he understood. 

"What a silly name for a robot!" he exclaimed. 

"I suppose you'd call it Robert. 
Will you go now, or shall I call 
more robots?" 

""I am not a fool," said Robert 
haughtily. "I shall go. Thank you 
for the disgusting dinner." 

"Do not use the front door,** 
said the robot. "Only MarciaJoan uses that. AH robots use 
other doors." 

Robert growled, but walked 
down the hall to the back door. 
As this swung open to permit his 
passage, he halted. 

"It's dark out there now," he 
complained over his shoulder. 
"Don't you have any lights on 
your grounds? Do you want me 
to trip over something?" 

"Of course I have ground 
lights | w shrilled Marcia-Joan. 
"Ill show you — not that I care 
if you trip or not." 

A moment later, lights concealed among the trees glowed 
into life. Robert walked outside 
and turned toward the cottage.

/ should have asked her what 
the colors of my robots had to do 
with it, he thought, and turned 
back to re-enter. 

He walked right into the closed 
door, which failed to open before 
him, though it had operated 
smoothly a moment ago. 

"Robots not admitted after 
dark," a mechanical voice informed him. "Return to your stall 
in the shed." 

"Whom do you think you're 
talking to?" demanded Robert. 
"I'm not one of your robots!" 

There was a pause. 

"Is it Marcia-Joan?" asked the 
Toice-box, after considerable buzzing and whirring. 

"No, I'm Robert." 
^ There was another pause while 
the mechanism laboriously shifted back to its other speech tape. 
Then: "Robots not admitted after 
dark. Return to your stall in the 
■hed." 

Robert slowly raised both 
hands to his temples. Lingeringly, 
he dragged them down over his 
cheeks and under his chin until 
at last the fingers interlaced over 
his tight lips. After a moment, he 
let out his breath between his 
fingers and dropped his hands to 
his sides. 

He raised one foot to kick, but 
decided that the door looked too 
hard. 

He walked away between the 
beds of flowers, grumbling. 



TJEACHING the vicinity of the 
cottage, he parted the tall 
shrubs bordering its grounds and 
looked through carefully before 
proceeding. Pleased at the gleam 
of water, he called Blue Two. 

"Good enough! Put the other 
robots away for the night. They 
can trim the edges tomorrow." 

He started into the cottage, but 
his major-domo warned, "Someone comes." 

Robert looked around. Through 
thin portions of the shrubbery, he 
caught a glimpse of MarciaJoan's crimson robe, nearly black 
in the diffused glow of the lights 
illuminating the grounds. 

"Robert!" called the girl angrily. "What are your robots doing? I saw them from my upstairs 
window — " 

"Wait there!" exclaimed Robert 
as she reached the shrubs. 

"What? Are you trying to tell 
me where I can go or not go? I— 

Yir 

The shriek was followed by a 
tremendous splash. Robert stepped forward in time to be spattered by part of the flying spray. 
It was cold. 

Naturally, being drawn from 
the brook, he reflected. Oh, well, 
the sun will warm it tomorrow. 

There was a frenzy of thrashing and splashing in the dimly 
lighted water at his feet, accompanied by coughs and spluttering 
demands that he "do something!" 



41 




 



MANNERS OF THE AOI 



Robert reached down with one 
hand, caught his hostess by the 
wrist, and heaved her up to solid 
ground. 

"My robots are digging you a 
little swimming hole," he told her. 
"They brought the water from 
the brook by a trench. You can 
finish it with concrete or plastics 
later; it's only fifteen by thirty 
feet." 

He expected some sort of acknowledgment of his efforts, and 
peered at her through the gloom 
when none was forthcoming. He 
thus caught a glimpse of the fullswinging slap aimed at his face. 
He tried to duck. 

There was another splash, followed by more floundering about. 

"Reach up," said Robert patiently, "and I'll pull you out 
again. I didn't expect you to like 
it this much." 

Marcia-Joan scrambled up the 
bank, tugged viciously at her sodden robe, and headed for the 
nearest pathway without replying. Robert followed along. 

As they passed under one of 
the lights, he noticed that the red 
reflections of the wet material, 
where it clung snugly to the girl's 
body, were almost the color of 
some of his robots. 

The tennis robot, he thought, 
and the moving targets tor archery — in /acf, all the sporting 
equipment. 

"You talk about food for the 



figure," he remarked lightly. "You 
shoufd see yourself now! It's 
really funny, the way — '* 

He stopped. Some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at 
the way the robe clung. 

Instead, he lengthened his 
stride, but he was still a few feet 
behind when she charged through 
the front entrance of the house. 
The door, having opened automatically for her, started to swing 
closed. Robert sprang forward to 
catch it. 

"Wait a minute!" he cried. 

Marcia-Joan snapped something that sounded like "Get 
out ! " over her shoulder, and 
squished off toward the stairs. As 
Robert started through the door 
to follow, the striped robot 
hastened toward him from its 
post in the hall. 

"Do not use the front door!" it' 
warned him. 

"Out of my way!" growled 
Robert. 

The robot reached out t» enforce the command. Robert seized 
it by the forearm and put all his 
weight into a sudden tug. The 
machine tottered off balance. Re* 
leasing his grip, he sent it staggering out the door with a quick 
shove . 

A HASTY glance showed Marcia-Joan flapping wetly up 
the last steps. Robert turned to 
face the. robot. 



5* 




 



"Do not use that door!" he 
quoted vindictively, and the robot halted its rush indecisively. 
"Only Marcia-Joan uses it," 

The major-domo hesitated. 
After a moment, it strode off 
around the corner of the house. 
First darting one more look at the 
stairs, Robert thrust his head outside and shouted: "Blue Two!" 

He held the door open while he 
waited. There was an answer from 
the shrubbery. Presently, his own 
supervisor hurried up. 

"Fetch the emergency toolbox!" 
Robert ordered. "And bring a 
couple of others with you." 

"Naturally, Robert. I would 
not carry it myself." 

A moment after the robot had 
departed on the errand, heavy 
steps sounded at the rear of the 
hall. Marcia- Joan's robot had 
dealt with the mechanism of the 
back door. 

Robert eyed the metal mask as 
the robot walked up to him. He 
found the color contrast less 
pleasant than ever. 

"I am not using the door," he 
said hastily. "I am merely holding it open." 

"Do you intend to use it?" 

"I haven't decided." 

"I shall carry you out back," 
the robot decided for him. 

"No, you don't!" exclaimed 
Robert, leaping backward. 

The door immediately began to 
swing shut as he passed through. 



Cursing, he lunged forward. The 
robot reached for him. 

This time, Robert missed his 
grip. Before he could duck away, 
his wrist was trapped in a metal 
grasp. 

The door will close, he despaired. They'll be too late. 

Then, suddenly, he felt the portal drawn back and heard Blue 
Two speak. 

"What does Robert wish?" 

"Throw this heap out the 
door!" gasped Robert. 

Amid a trampling of many feet, 
the major-domo was raised bodily by Blue Two and another 
pair of Robert's machines and 
hustled outside. Since the grip on 
Robert's wrist was not relaxed, 
he involuntarily accompanied the 
rush of metal bodies. 

"Catch the door!" he called to 
Blue Two. 

When the latter sprang to obey, 
the other two took the action as a 
signal to drop their burden. The 
pink-and-blue robot landed full 
length with a jingling crash. Robert was free. 

With the robots, he made for 
the entrance. Hearing footsteps 
behind him as the major-domo 
regained its feet, he slipped 
hastily inside. 

"Pick up that toolbox !" he 
snapped. 'When that robot stops 
in the doorway, knock its head 
off!" 

Turning, he held up a finger.

"Do not use the front door!" 

The major-domo hesitated. 

The heavy toolbox in the grip 
of Blue Two descended with a 
thud. The pink-and-blue robot 
landed on the ground a yard or 
two outside the door as if dropped 
from the second floor. It bounced 
once, emitted a few sparks and 
pungent wisps of smoke, lay still. 

"Never mind, that's good 
enough," said Robert as Blue Two 
stepped forward. "One of the 
others can drag it off to the repair 
shop. Have the toolbox brought 
with us." 

"What does Robert wish now?" 



inquired Blue Two, trailing the 
man toward the stairway. 

"I'm going upstairs," said Robert. "And I intend to be prepared 
if any more doors are closed 
against me!" 

He started up, the measured 
treads of his own robots sounding 
reassuringly behind him . . . , 

IT was about a week later that 
Robert sat relaxed in the armchair before his own telescreen, 
facing Henry's wizened visage. 

The elder man clucked sympathetically as he re-examined the 
scratches on Robert's face and the 
bruise under his right eye.

"And so you left there in the 
morning?" 

"I certainly did!" declared 
Robert. "We registered a marriage record at the city library by 
television, of course, but I don't 
care if I never see her again. She 
needn't even tell me about the 
child, if any. I simply can't stand 
(hat girl!" 

"Now, now," Henry said. 

"I mean it! Absolutely no consideration for my wishes. Everything in the house was run to suit 
her convenience." 

"After all," Henry pointed out, 
"it is her house." 

Robert glared. "What has that 
to do with it? 1 don't think I was 
as unreasonable as she said in 
smashing that robot. The thing 
just wouldn't let me alone!" 

"I guess," Henry suggested, "it 
was conditioned to obey MarciaJoan, not you." 

"Well, that shows you! Whose 
orders are to count, anyway? 
When 1 tell a robot to do something, I expect it done. How 
would you like to find robots trying to boss you around?" 

"Ar* you talking about robots,** 
asked Henry, "or the girl?" 

"Same thing, isn't it? Or it 
would be if I'd decided to bring 
her home with me." 

"Conflict of desires," murmured 
Henry. 

"Exactly ! It's maddening to 
have a perfectly logical action in


terfered with because there's another person present to insist— 
insist, mind you — on having her 
way." 

"And for twenty-odd years, 
you've had your own way in 
every tiny thing." 

Somewhere in the back of Robert's mind lurked a feeling that 
Henry sounded slightly sarcastic. 

"Well, why shouldn't I?" he demanded. "I noticed that in every 
disagreement, my view was the 
right one." 

"It was?" 

"Of course it was! What did 
you mean by that tone?" 

"Nothing . . ." Henry seemed 
lost in thought. "I was just wondering how many 'right* views are 
left on this* planet. There must be 
quite a few, all different, even if 
we have picked up only a few by 
television. An interesting facet of 
our peculiar culture — every individual omnipotent and omniscient, within his own sphere.*" 

Robert regarded him with indignant incredulity. 

"You don't seem to understand 
my point," he began again. "I told 
her we ought to come to my 
house, where things are better 
arranged, and she simply refused. 
Contradicted me! It was most — * 

He broke off. 

"The impudence of him!" he 
exclaimed. "Signing off when / 
wanted to talk!"
