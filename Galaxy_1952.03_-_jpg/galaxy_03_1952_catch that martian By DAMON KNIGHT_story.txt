catch that martian By DAMON KNIGHT 

THE first person who got 
on the Martian's nerves, 
according to a survey I 
made just recently, was a Mrs. 
Frances Economy, about 42, five 
foot three, heavy-set, with prominent mole on left cheek, formerly 
of 302 West 46th Street, Manhattan. Mrs. Economy went to 
a neighborhood movie on the 
night of September 5th, and half


way through the first feature, just 
as she was scrabbling for the last 
of her popcorn, zip — she wasn't 
there any more. 

That is, she was only hall 
there. She could still see the 
screen, but it was like a television 
set with the sound off. The way 
she realized something had happened to her, she started stomping her feet, like you do when the sound goes off or the picture 
stops, and her feet didn't make 
any noise. 

In fact, she couldn't feel the 
floor, just some kind of rubbery 
ttuff that seemed to be holding 
her up. Same way with the arms 
of her chair. They weren't there, 
as far as her feeling them went. 

Everything was dead still. She 
could hear her own breathing, 
and the gulp when she swallowed 
that last mouthful, and her heart 
beating if she listened close. That 
was all. When she got up and 
went out, she didn't step on anybody's feet — and she fried to. 

Of course I asked her who was 
sitting next to her when it happened, but she doesn't remember. 
She djdn't notice. It was like that 
with everybody. 

T^OT to keep you in suspense, 
* the Martian did it. We figured that out later. There still 
isn't any proof, but it has to be 
that way. This Martian, the way 
it figures, looks just like anybody 
else. He could be the little guy 
with the derby hat and the sour 
expression, or the girl with the 
china-blue eyes, or the old gent 
with the chin spinach and glasses 
on a string. Anybody. 

But he's a Martian. I don't see 
what else he could be. And being a Martian, he's got this power 
that people haven't got. If he 
feels like it, he just looks at you 



cockeyed, and 2ip — you're in 
some other dimension. I don't 
know what the scientists would 
call it, the Fourth or Fifth Dimension or what, but I call it 
the next-door dimension because 
it seems like it's right next door 
— you can see into it. In other 
words, it's a place where other 
people can see you, but they 
can't hear you or touch you, unless they're ghosts too, and there*! 
nothing but some kind of cloudy 
stuff to walk around on. I don't 
know if that sounds good or what. 
It stinks. It's just plain dull. 

One more thing, he annoy* 
easy. You crunch popcorn in his 
ear, he doesn't like that. You 
step on his toe. same thing. Say, 
"Hot enough for you?" or slap 
him on the back when he's got 
sunburn, serve him a plate of 
soup with your finger in itzip. 

The way we figured out it's ■ 
Martian was that^it couldn't be 
one of us. No human can do a 
thing like that. Right? So what 
else could he be but a Martian? 
It figures. And nobody ever noticed him, so it must be he looks 
like anybody else. Some humans, 
they look like everybody else, but 
not because they want to. He 
wants to, I bet. 

The way we know he annoys 
easy, there was eighteen "ghosts'* 
wandering around when the public first noticed, which was dur

ing the early morning of September 6th. That was about eleven 
hours after he got Mrs. Economy. 

Thirteen of them were up at 
Broadway and 49th, walking 
through traffic. They went right 
through the cars. By nine o'clock 
there were two wrecks on that 
corner and a busted hydrant 
gushing water all over. The ghost 
people walked through the water 
and didn't get wet. 

Three more showed up in front 
of a big delicatessen near 72nd 
Street and Amsterdam Avenue, 
just looking in the window. Every 
once in a while one of them 
would reach in through the glass 
and grab for something, but his 
hand went through the pastrami 
and chopped liver, so none of 
them got anything. That was fine 
for store windows, but it wasn't 
so fine for the ghost people, 

The other two were sailors. 
They were out in the harbor, 
walking on water and thumbing 
their noses at naval officers 
aboard the ships that were anchored out there. It was hell on 
discipline. 

The first eight patrolmen who 
reported all this got told they 
would be fired if they ever came 
on duty drunk again. But by 
ten-thirty it was on the radio, 
and then WPIX sent a camera 
prew up, and by the time the 
afternoon papers came out there 
,,were so many people in Times 



Square that we had to put a 
cordon around the ghosts and divert traffic. 

The delicatessen window up on 
Amsterdam got busted from the 
crowd leaning against it, or some 
guy trying to put his hand 
through the way the three ghosts 
did; we never figured out which. 
There were about sixty tugs, 
launches and rowboats in the harbor, and three helicopters, trying 
to get close enough to talk to 
the sailors. 

One thing we know, the Martian must have been in that 
crowd on Times Square, because 
between one and one-thirty p. m. 
seven more ghosts wandered 
through the barrier and joined 
the other ones. You could tell they 
were mad, but of course you 
couldn't tell what they were saying unless you could read lips. 

Then there were some more 
down by Macy's in the afternoon, 
and a few in Greenwich Village, 
and by evening we had lost count. 
The guesses in the- papers that 
night ran from three hundred to 
a thousand. It was the Times that 
said three hundred. The cops 
didn't give out any estimate at 
all. 

r |iHE next day, there was just 
nothing else at all in the 
papers, or on the radio or TV. 
Bars did an all-time record business. So did churches.

The Mayor appointed a committee to investigate. The Police 
Commissioner called out special 
reserves to handle the mobs. The 
Governor was understood to say 
he was thinking about declaring 
a statewide emergency, but all he 
got in most papers was half a 
column among the ads. Later on 
he denied the whole thing. 

Everybody had to be asked 
what he thought, from Einstein 
to Martin and Lewis. Some people said mass hysteria, some said 
the end of the world, some said 
the Russians. 

Winchell was th£ first one to 
say in print that it was a Martian. I had the same idea myself, 
but by the time I got it all worked 
out I jvas too late to get the 
credit. 

I was handicapped, because all 
this time 1 still hadn't seen one 
of the ghosts yet. I was on Safe, 
Loft and Truck — just promoted 
last spring from a patrolman — 
•nd while I was on duty I never 
got near any of the places where 
they were congregating. In the 
evenings, I had to take care of 
my mother. 

But my brain was working. I 
bad this Martian idea, and I kept 
thinking, thinking, all the time. 

I knew better than to mention 
this to Captain Rifkowicz. All I 
would have to do was mention 
to him that I was thinking, and 



he would say, "With what, Dunlop, with what?" or something 
sarcastic like that. As for asking 
him to get me transferred to Homicide or Missing Persons, where 

I might get assigned to the ghost 
case, that was out. Rifkowicz 
says I should have been kept on 
a beat long enough for my arches 
to fall, in order to leave more 
room on top for brains. 

So I was on my own. And that 
evening, when they started announcing the rewards, I knew I 
had to get that Martian. There 
was fifteen hundred dollars, voted 
by the City Council that afternoon, for whoever would find out 
what was making the ghosts and 
stop it. Because if it didn't stop, 
there would be eighteen thousand 
ghosts in a month, and over two 
hundred thousand in a year. 

Then there was a bunch of 
private rewards, running from 
twenty-five bucks to five hundred, offered by people that had 
relatives among the departed. 
There was a catch to those, 
though — you had to get the relatives back. 

All together, they added up to 
nearly five thousand. With that 
dough, I could afford to hire 
somebody to take care of Ma and 
maybe have some private life of 
my own. There was a cute waitress down on Varick Street, where 
I had lunch every day. For a long 




 



time I had been thinking if I 
asked her to go out, maybe she 
would say yes. But what was the 
use of me asking her, if all I 
could do was have her over to 
listen to Ma talk? All Ma talked 
about was how sick she was and 
how nobody cared. 

FIRST thing I did, I got together all the newspaper stuff 
about the ghosts. I spread it out 
on the living room table and 
sorted it and started pasting it 
into a scrapbook. Right away I 
saw I had to have more information. What was in the papers was 
mostly stories about the crowds 
and the accidents and traffic tieups, plus interviews with people 
that didn't know anything. 

What I wanted to know was — 
what were all these people doing 
when the Martian got them? If 
I knew that, maybe I could figure 
out some kind of a pattern, like 
if the Martian's pet peeve was 
back-slappers, or people who 
make you jump a foot when they 
sneeze, or whatever. 

Another thing, I wanted to 
know all the times and places. 
From that, I could figure out 
what the Martian's habits were, 
if he had any, and with all of it 
together I could maybe arrange 
to be on the spot whenever he 
got sore. Then anybody except 
me who was there evejy time 
would have to be him. 



I explained all this to Ma, 
hoping she would make a sacrifice 
and let me get Mrs. Proctor from 
across the hall to sit with her 
a few evenings. She didn't seem 
to get the idea. Ma never believes anything she reads in the 
papers, anyway, except the 
astrology column. The way it 
struck her, the whole thing was 
some kind of a scheme, like 
gangsters or publicity, and I 
would be better to stay away 
from it. 

I made one more try, talking 
up the money I would get, but all 
she said was, "Well, then why 
don't you just re// that Captain 
Rifkowicz he's got to let you earn 
that reward?" 

Ma has funny ideas about a lot 
of things. She came over here 
from England when she was a 
girl, and it looks like she never 
did get to understand America. I 
knew that if I kept after her, 
she would start crying and telling 
me about all the things she did 
for me when I was a baby. You 
can't argue against that. 

So what I did next, I took the 
bull by the horns. I waited till 
Ma went to sleep and then I just 
walked out and hopped an uptown bus on Seventh Avenue. If 
I couldn't get off during the daytime, I would cut down my sleep 
for a while, that was all. 

I was heading for Times 
Square, but at Twenty -seventh I

saw a crowd on the sidewalk. I 
,got out and ran over there. Sure 
enough, in the middle of the 
crowd was two of the ghosts, a 
fat man with a soupstrainer mustache and a skinny woman with 
cherries on her hat. You could 
tell they were ghosts because the 
people were waving their hands 
through them. Aside from that, 
there was no difference. 

I took the lady first, to be 
polite. I flashed the badge, and 
then I hauled out my notebook 
and wrote, "Name and address 
please," and shoved it at her. 

She got the idea and looked 
through her bag for a pencil and 
an envelope. She scribbled, "Mrs. 
Walter F. Walters, Schenectady, 
N. Y." 

tasked her, "When did this 
happen to you and where?" 

She wrote it was about one P.M. 
the afternoon before, and she 
was in Schrafft's on "Broadway 
near 37th, eating lunch with her 
husband. I asked her if the fat 
man was her husband, and she 
said he was. 

I then asked her if she could 
remember exactly what the two 
of them were doing right at the 
moment when it happened. She 
thought a while and then said 
she was talking and her husband 
was dunking his doughnut in his 
coffee. I asked her if it was the 
kind with powdered sugar and 
she said yes. 



t knew then that I was on the 
right track. She was one of those 
little women with big jaws that 
generally seem to have loud 
voices and like to use them; and 
I always hated people who dunk 
those kind of doughnuts, myself. 
The powdered sugar gets wet and 
gluey and the dunkers have to 
lick their fingers right in public. 

I thanked them and went on 
uptown. When I got back home 
that night, about four a. m. the 
next morning, I had fifteen interviews in my book. The incidents 
had taken place all over the midtown area. Six got theirs for talking, four on crowded sidewalks 
— probably for jostling or stepping on corns — two for yelling on 
a quiet street at two in the morning, one for dunking, one for 
singing to himself on a subway, 
one, judging by the look of him, 
for not being washed, and one 
for coming in late to a Broadway 
play. The six talkers broke down 
to three in restaurants, two in a 
newsreel movie, and one in Carnegie Hall while a concert was 
going on. 

Nobody remembered who they 
were next to at the time, but I 
was greatly encouraged. I had a 
hunch I was getting somewhere 
already.

CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



call my attention to it. I suppose 
I wasn't worth more than a nickel 
to the City that day, but I promised myself I would make it up 
later. For the moment, I ignored 
Rifkowicz. 

On the radio and TV, there 
were two new developments. In 
my head, there was one. 

First, the radio and TV. I ate 
lunch in a saloon so as to catch 
the latest news, even though I 
had to give up my daily glimpse 
of the waitress in the beanery. 
Two things were new. One, people 
had started noticing that a few 
things had turned into ghosts — 
besides people, I mean. Things 
like a barrel organ, and an automobile that had its horn stuck, 
and like that. 

TL^t made things twice as bad, 
of course, because anybody was 
liable to try to touch one of these 
ghost things and jump to the 
conclusion they were a ghost, 
themselves. 

Two, the TV reporters were interviewing the ghosts, the same 
way I did, with paper and pencil. 
I picked up four more sets of 
questions and answers just while 
I was eating lunch. 

The ghosts came over fine on 
TV, by the way. Somehow it 
looked even creepier on the 
screen, when you saw somebody's 
hand disappear into them, than 
it did when you saw it with your 
own eyes. 



The development in my head 
was like this. Out of the fifteen 
cases I already had, and the four 
I got from TV, there were eight 
that happened on the street or in 
subways or buses, five in restaurants, and six in places 
of entertainment. Four different 
places of entertainment. Now, at 
first glance, that may not look 
like it means much. But I said 
to myself, "What does this Martian do? He travels around from 
one place to another — that's normal. He eats — that's normal. But 
he goes to four different shows 
that I know about in three days 
— and I know just nineteen cases 
out of maybe a thousand!** 

It all fitted together. Here is 
this Martian. He's never been 
here before. We know that because he just now started making 
trouble. The way I see it, these 
Martians look us over for a while 
from a distance, and then they 
decide to send one Martian down 
to New York to study us close 
up. Well, what's the first thing 
he does, being that he wants to 
find out all about us? He goes 
to the movies. And concerts and 
stage plays too, of course, because he wants to try everything 
once. But probably he sees two 
or three double features a day. 
It stands to reason. 

So there he is in the movie, 
watching and listening so he 
shouldn't miss anything impor



 



tent, and some customer around 
him starts making loud comments 
to somebody else,, rattling cellophane, and snapping a pocketbook open and shut every five 
seconds to find akleenex. So he 
flips them into the next dimension, where they can make all 
the noise they want without bothering him. 

And that's the reason why there 
arc so many ghosts that got 
theirs in the movies and places 
like that. On the streets of any 
city you can walk for miles without running into more than two 
or three really obnoxious characters, but in any kind of a theater 
there's always somebody talking, 
or coughing, or rattling paper. 
You've noticed that. 

I went even further than that. 
I checked with my notes and 
then looked in a copy of Cue 
magazine to find out what was 
playing at each of those theaters 
when the Martian was there. 

I found out that the play was 
a long-run musical — the concert 
was musical, naturally — and one 
of the two movies was a Hollywood remake of a musical comedy. The other was a newsreel. 

There it was. I as good as had 
him. Then I got another idea and 
went back through my notes to 
find out where the theater victims had been sitting. The guy 
in Carnegie Hall had been in the 
balcony; that's where you hear 



best. I guess. But the other five 
had all been sitting down front, 
in the first four rows. 

The little giiy was nearsighted. 

That's the way I was thinking 
about him now — a little nearsighted guy who liked music better than Westerns, and was used 
to some place where everybody's 
careful not to bother anybody 
else. It was hard not to feel 
sorry for him ; after all, some 
people that come from places 
closer than Mars have a hard 
time in New York. 

But it was me against him. 
That night the total rewards were 
up to almost twenty thousand 
dollars. 

T THOUGHT of one thing I 
could do right away. I could 
write to the Mayor to make an 
announcement that if people 
didn't want to be ghosts, they 
should keep from making unnecessary noise or being pests, especially in theaters. But one, he 
probably wouldn't pay any attention to me, and two, if he did, 
twenty thousand other guys 
would be following my lead before I could turn around, and one 
of them would probably catch the 
Martian before I did. 

That night, I did the same as 
before. I waited till Ma was 
sleeping, then went out to a movie 
on Broadway. It was a first-run 
house, they bad a musical play

ing, and I sat down front. 

But nothing happened. The 
Martian wasn't there. 

I felt pretty discouraged when 
I got home. My time was running 
out and there are over three hundred theaters in Manhattan. I 
had to start working faster. 

I lay awake for a long while, 
worrying and thinking about it, 
and finally I came to one of the 
most important decisions in my 
life. The next morning I was going to do something I never did 
before — call in and pretend like 
I was sick. And I was going to 
stay sick until I found the Martian. 

I felt bad about it and I felt 
even worse in the morning, when 
Rifkowicz told me to take it easy 
till Wgot welt. 

After breakfast. I got the 
papers and made a list of shows 
on my way uptown. I went to 
one on 42nd Street first — it was 
a musical picture about some 
composer named Handle, and the 
second feature was a comedy, but 
it had Hoagy Carmichael in it. 
so I figured I should stay for that 
too. I sat in the fifth row. There 
was plenty of coughing going on, 
only nobody got turned into a 
ghost. 

Then I had lunch and went to 
another musical, on Broadway. 
I drew another blank. 

My eyes were beginning to 
bother me a little from sitting so 



close to the screen, so I thought 
I would just go to a newsreel 
movie and then walk around a 
while before dinner. But when I 
got out of the newsreel I began 
to feel jittery, and I went straight 
to another double feature. The 
Martian wasn't there, either. 

I had seen plenty of ghosts 
standing around on the streets, 
but they were all just standing 
there looking kind of lost and 
bewildered, the way they did 
after a while. You could tell a 
new victim because he would be 
rushing here and there, shoving 
his hands through things, trying 
to talk to people, and acting all 
upset. 

One thing I forgot to mention. 
Everybody was wondering now 
how these ghosts got along without eating. In this dimension 
where they wer ? e, there wasn't any 
food — there wasn't anything, just 
thv stuff like rubbery clouds that 
they were standing on. But they 
all claimed they weren't hungry 
or thirsty, and they all seemed to 
be in good shape. Even the ones 
that had been ghosts now for 
four days. 

When I got out of that last 
movie, tt was about eight in the 
evening. I was feeling low in my 
mind, but I still had a healthy 
appetite. I started wandering 
around the side streets of Broadway, looking for a restaurant that 
wasn't too crowded or too ex

pensive. I passed a theater that 
was on my list, except I knew I 
was too late to get a ticket for it. 
It was the premiere of the newest 
Rodgers and Hammerstein show, 
and the lobby and half the sidewalk were full of customers. 

I went on past, feeling gloomier 
because of all the bright lights 
and excitement, and then I heard 
something funny. Without paying 
any attention, I had been listening to one of these raspy-voiced 
barkers inside the lobby going, 
"GETcha program here." Now, 
all of a sudden, he said^ "GETch — " and stopped. 

I turned around, with a funny 
prickling up the back of my 
spine. The voice didn't start up 
again. Just as I started back toward the lobby, a ghost came out 
of the crowd. There was no doubt 
about him being a ghost — he ran 
through people. 

He had a bunch of big booklets 
with slick covers under his arm, 
and his mouth was wide open 
like he was shouting. Then he 
showed his teeth, and his face 
got all red, and he lifted the booklets in both hands and threw 
them away as hard as he could. 
They went through people, too. 

The ghost walked away with 
his hands shoved into his pockets. 

TJUNNING into that lobby, I 
shoved my badge at the 
ticket taker, and told him to find 



me the manager, quick. 

When the manager came up I 
grabbed him by the Ispels and 
said, "1 got reason to believe 
there's a dangerous criminal going 
to be in this audience tonight. 
With your cooperation, we'll get 
him." He looked worried, so I 
said, "There won't be any trouble. 
You just put me where I can see 
the front rows and leave the rest 
to me." 

He said, "I can't give you & 
seat. The house is completely sold 
out." 

I told him, "Okay, put me back 
in the wings, or whatever you 
call them." 

He argued, but he did what 1 
asked. We went down the side 
aisle, through the orchestra pit 
and through a little door that 
went under the stage. Then we 
went up a little stairway to backstage, and he put me right at the 
edge of the stage, up front, where 
I could peek out at the audience. 

There was a crowd of people 
running around back there behind 
the curtains, actors and chorus 
girls, guys in their shirt sleeves 
and guys in overalls. I could hear 
the hum out front — people were 
beginning to fill the seats — and I 
wanted that curtain to go up. I 
just couldn't wait. 

Finally the actors took their 
places, and the band suddenly 
started playing, and the curtain 
went up. 



CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



T understand that show Is still 
playing to standing room only, 
even with all the trouble that's 
happened since then, but 1 didn't 
pay any attention to it and I 
couldn't even tell you what it was 
about. I was watching the front 
four rows, trying to memorize 
every face I saw. 

Right in the middle there were 
three that I paid more attention 
to than the rest. One of them was 
a young blonde girl with blue 
eyes like the color of Ma's fancy 
china that she brought with, her 
from the old country. Another 
was an old gent with chin spinach 
and glasses on a string. The third 
was a little guy with a sour expression and a derby hat. 

l^don't know why I picked out 
those three, except maybe it was 
a hunch. Maybe I was looking 
at the blonde girl just because 
she was pretty, but then again, I 
never saw eyes that color before 
or since. It could be that Martians have china-blue eyes; how 
would I know? I might have had 
some wild idea that the old guy 
could be the Martian and was 
wearing the frizzy white whiskers 
because Martians don't have 
chins exactly like us. And I think 
I picked on the little guy because 
he fitted the picture I already had 
in my head. And the way he was 
clutching that derby in his lap, 
like it was made of gold — I was 
thinking to myself, maybe he's 



got some kind of ray gun built 

into that hat; maybe that's how 
he does it. 

T ADMIT that I wasn't thinking very logical — I was too 
excited — but I never took my 
eyes off that . audience for a 
second. 

I was waiting for somebody to 
start coughing or sneezing and 
get turned into a ghost. When 
that happened, I would be watching the people, and if I was 
lucky I might see who was looking at the victim when it happened. 

That's what I was waiting for. 
What I got was a sniff of smoke 
and then somebody started 
screaming and yelling, "Fire!" 

Half the audience was on their 
feet in a second. I looked up, 
and sure enough there was smoke 
pouring out at the back of 
the room. Some more women 
screamed and the stampede was 
on. 

The gi rls on sta ge stopped 
dancing and the band stopped 
playing. Somebody — some actor 
— ran out on the stage and started 
saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, 
your attention please. Walk, do 
not run, to the nearest exit. There 
is no danger. Walk, do not run — " 
I lost my head. Not on account 
. of the fire. I knew the actor was 
right and the only bad thing that 
could happen would be people

trampling each other to death to 
get out of there. But the seats 
were emptying fast and it struck 
me all of a sudden that I didn't 
know my way through that tangle 
of scenery backstage. By the time 
I got down the stairs and out into 
the auditorium, the Martian 
might be gone. 

I felt cold all over. I didn't even 
stop to remember that I didn't 
have to go back the way I came, 
because there were little steps 
right at the side of the stage. I 
ran out from behind the wings 
and started to jump over the 
musicians. At that, I would have 
made it if I hadn't caught my toe 
in that little trough where the 
footlights are. 

I had worse luck than that, 
even. I landed smack in the middle of the bass drum. 

You never heard such a noise 
in your life. It sounded as if the 
ceiling caved in. Sitting there, 
with my legs and arms sticking 
out of that drum, I saw the people turn around and look at me 
like they had been shot. I saw 
them all, the girl with the chinablue eyes, the old' gent with the 
whiskers, the little guy with the 
derby, and a lot more. And then, 
suddenly, all the sound stopped, 
game as when you turn off a 
radio. 

The guy who owned the drum 
leaned over and tried to pull me 
out of it. He couldn't. 



His hands went right through 
me. 

T IKE I said, this Martian annoys easy. I dont know what 
he did about all those women 
screaming — maybe he figured 
there was a good reason for that 
and left them alone. But when I 
hit that bass drum, it must have 
burned him good. You know, 
when you're excited already, a 
loud noise will make you jump 
twice as far. 

That's about the only satisfaction I got — that I probably annoyed him the worst of anybody 
in New York City. 

That and being so close to 
catching him. 

The company here is nothing to 
brag about — women that will 
talk your arm off and half your 
shoulder, and guys that say, 
"Peaceful enough for you?" and 
back-slappers, and people that 
hum to themselves — 

Besides that, the place is so 
damned dull. Clouds to stand on, 
nothing to eat even if you wanted 
to eat, and nothing to do except 
stand around and watch the new 
ones come through. We can't even 
* see much of New York any more, 
because it keeps getting mistier 
all the time — fading away, kind 
of, like maybe this dimension is 
getting a little farther away from 
the ordinary one every day. 

I asked Mr. Dauth yesterday 



CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



9t 



hew he thought the whole thing 

would wind up. Mr. Dauth isn't 
bad. He's a big, cheerful guy, 
about fifty. The kind that likes 
good food and good beer and a 
lot of it. But he doesn't complain. 
He admits that his habit of sucking his teeth out real loud is aggravating and says maybe he deserved what he got, which you'll 
admit is big of him. So I talk 
to him a lot, and the other day, 
when we were watching a new 
batch that had just come through, 
I asked him where Ke thought it 
would all end, because we can 
hear each other, you see, being 
in the same dimension. 

He pursed his lips and frowned 
like he was thinking it over, and 
then said that as far as he could 
Me, there wasn't any human be


ing that was perfect. Anybody is 
liable to do something aggravating sooner or later. That's the 
way people are. 

"And this Martian of yours 
seems to be thorough," he said. 
"Very thorough. It might take 
him years to get through studying 
the Earth." 

"And then what?" I asked him. 

"Well," he said, "eventually, 
if he keeps it up long enough, 
we'll all be over here." 

I hope he's right. Now that I 
come to think of it, that cute 
waitress I mentioned has a habit 
of setting down a coffee cup so 
half of it slops into the saucer. If 
Mr. Dauth is right, all I've got 
to do is wait. 

It stands to reason.
