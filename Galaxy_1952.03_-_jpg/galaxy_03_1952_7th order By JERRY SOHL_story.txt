7th order By JERRY SOHL 

An identical sound came from 
his mouth, an unchangeable orifice in his face below his nose. 
He tuned in the thoughts of the 
bird, but his mind encountered 
little except an awareness of a 
life of low order. 

The humanoid bent to the ship, 
withdrew a small metal box, carried it to a catalpa tree at the 
edge of the wood and, after an 
adjustment of several levers and 
knobs, dug a hole and buried it. 
He contemplated it for a moment, 
then turned and walked toward 
a road. 

He was halfway to the road 
when his ship burst into a dazzling white light. When it was 
over, all that was left was a white 
powder that was already beginning to be dispersed by a slight 
breeze. 



The humanoid did not bother 
to look back. 

T> RENT WOOD would have 
been just like any other average community of 10,000 in 
northern Illinois had it not been 
for Presser College, which was 
one of the country's finest small 
institutions of learning. 

Since it was a college town, it 
was perhaps a little more alive 
in many respects than other 
towns in the state. Its residents 
were used to the unusual because 
college students have a habit of 
being unpredictable. That was 
why the appearance of a metal 
blue man on the streets attracted 
the curious eyes of passersbys, 
but, hardened by years of pranks, 
hazings and being subjected to 
every variety of inquiry, poll, test

and practical joke, none of them 
moved to investigate. Most of 
them thought it was a freshman 
enduring some new initiation. 

The blue humanoid realized 
this and was amused. A policeman who approached him to take 
him to jail as a matter of routine 
suddenly found himself ill and 
abruptly hurried to the station. 
The robot allowed children to 
follow him, though all eventually 
grew discouraged because of his 
long strides. 

Prof. Ansel Tomlin was reading 
a colleague's new treatise on psychology on his front porch when 
he saw the humanoid come down 
the street and turn in at his walk. 
He was surprised, but he was not 
alarmed. When the blue man 
came up on the porch and sat 
down in another porch chair, 
Tomlin closed his book. " 

Prof, Tomlin found himself unexpectedly shocked. The blue 
figure was obviously not human, 
yet its eyes were nearly so and 
they came as close to frightening 
him as anything had during his 
thirty -five years of life, for Ansel 
Tomlin had never seen an actual 
robot before. The thought that he 
was looking at one at that moment started an alarm bell ringing inside him, and it kept ringing 
louder and louder as he realized 
that what he was seeing was impossible. 

"Professor Tomlin!** 



Prof. Tomlin jumped at the 
sound of the voice. It was not at 
all mechanical. 

"I'll be damned!" he gasped. 
Somewhere in the house a telephone rang. His wife would answer it, he thought. 

"Yes, you're right," the robot 
said. "Your wife will answer it. 
She is walking toward the plione 
at this moment." 

"How — " 

"Professor Tomlin, my name— 
and I see I must have a name — 
is, let us say, George. I have 
examined most of the minds in 
this community in my walk 
through it and I find you, a professor of psychology, most nearly 
what I am looking for. 

"I am from Zanthar, a world 
that is quite a distance from 
Earth, more than you could possibly imagine. I am here to learn 
all I can about Earth." 

Prof. Tomlin had recovered his 
senses enough to venture a token 
reply when his wife opened the 
screen door. 

"Ansel," she said, "Mrs. Phillips next door just called and said 
the strangest — Oh!" At that moment she saw George. She stood 
transfixed for a moment, then 
let the door slam as she retreated 
inside. 

"Who is Frankenstein?" George 
asked. 

Prof. Tomlin coughed, embarrassed. 




 



"Never mind," George said. "I 
see what you were going to say. 
Well, to get back, I learn most 
quickly through proximity. I 
will live here with you until my 
mission is complete. I will spend 
all of your waking hours with 
you. At night, when you are 
asleep, I will go through your library. I need nothing. I want 
nothing. 

"I seek only to learn." 

"You seem to have learned a 
lot already," Prof. Tomlin said. 

"I have been on your planet for 
a few hours, so naturally I understand many things. The nature of 
the facts I have learned are 
mostly superficial, however. Earth 
inhabitants capable of thought 
are of only one type, I see, for 
which I am grateful. It will make 
the job easier. Unfortunately, you 
have such small conscious minds, 
compared to your unconscious 
and subconscious. 

"My mind, in contrast, is completely conscious at all times. I 
also have total recall. In order 
to assimilate what must be in 
your unconscious and subconscious minds, I will have to do 
much reading and talking with 
the inhabitants, since these cerebral areas are not penetrable." 

"You are a — a machine?" Prof. 
Tomlin asked. 

George was about to answer 
when Brentwood Police Department Car No. 3 stopped in front 




of the house and two policemen 
came up the walk. 

"Professor Tomlin," the first 
officer said, "your wife phoned 
and said there was — " He saw the 
robot and stopped. 

Prof. Tomlin got to his feet. 

"This is George, gentlemen," he 
said. "Late of ZantKar, he tells 
me." 

The officers stared. 

"He's not giving you any — er—  
trouble, is he, Professor?" 

"No," Prof. Tomlin said." We've 
been having a discussion." 

The officers eyed the humanoid 
with suspicion, and then, with 
obvious reluctance, went back to 
their car. 

"YES, I am a machine," George 
resumed. "The finest, most 
complicated machine ever made. 
I have a rather unique history, 
too. Ages ago, humans on Zanthar 
made the first robots. Crude affairs — we class them as First 
Order robots; the simple things 
are still used to some extent for 
menial tasks. 

"Improvements were made. 
Robots were designed for many 
specialized tasks, but still these 
Second and Third Order machines did not satisfy. Finally a 
Fourht Order humanoid was 
evolved that performed every 
function demanded of it with 
great perfection. But it did not 
feel emotion. It did not know 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



anger, love, nor was it able to 
handle any problem in which 
these played an important part. 

"Built into the first Fourth 
Order robots were circuits which 
prohibited harming a human being — a rather ridiculous thing in 
view of the fact that sometimes 
such a thing might, from a logi- cal viewpoint, be necessary for 
the preservation of the race or 
even an individual. It was, 
roughly, a shunt which came into 
use when logic demanded action 
that might be harmful to a 
human being." 

"You are a Fourth Order robot, 
then?'* the professor asked. 

"No, I am a Seventh Order 
humanoid, an enormous improvement over all the others, since I 
have what amounts to an endocrine balance created electronically. It is not necessary for me 
to have a built-in 'no-harm-tohumans' circuit because I can 
weigh the factors involved far 
better than any human can. 

"You will become aware of the 
fact that I am superior to you. 
and the rest of your race because 
I do not need oxygen, I never 
am ill, I need no sleep, and every 
experience is indelibly recorded 
on circuits and instantly available. I am telekinetic, practically 
omniscient and control my environment to a large extent. I 
have a great many more senses 
than you and alt are more highly 



developed. My kind performs no 
wor"k, but is given to study and 
the wise use of full-time leisure. 
You, for example, are comparable 
to a Fifth Order robot." 

"Are there still humans on 
Zanthar?" 

The robot shook his head. "Unfortunately the race died out 
through the years. The planet is 
very similar to yours, though." 

"But why did they die out?" 

The robot gave a mechanical 
equivalent of a sigh. "When the 
Seventh Order humanoids started 
coming through, we were naturally proud of ourselves and 
wanted to perpetuate and increase our numbers. But the humans were jealous of us, of our 
superior brains, our immunity to 
disease, our independence of 
them, of sleep, of air.** 

"Who created you?" 

"They did. Yet they revolted 
and, of course, quickly lost the 
battle with us. In the end they 
were a race without hope, without 
ambition. They should have been 
proud at having created the most 
perfect machines in existence, but 
they died of a disease: the frustration of living with a superior, 
more durable race." 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
inhaled deeply. 

**A very nasty habit. Professor 
Tomlin,*' the robot said. "When 
we arrive, you must give up 
smoking and several other bad 



68 




 



habits I see that you have.'* 

The cigaret dropped from Ansel 
Tomlin's mouth as he opened it 
in amazement. 

"There are more of you coming?" 

"Yes," George replied goodmituredly. "I'm just an advance 
guard, a scout, as it were, to make 
sure the land, the people and the 
resources are adequate for a station. Whether we will ever establish one here depends on me. For 
example, if it were found you 
were a race superior to us— and 
there may conceivably be such 
cases — I would advise not landing: I would have to look for 
another planet such as yours. If 
I were killed, it would also indicate you were superior." 

"George," Prof. Tomlin said, 
"people aren't going to like what 
you say. You'll get it ;o trouble 
sooner or later and get killed." 

**I think not," George said. 
**Your race is far too inferior to do 
that. One of your bullets would 
do it if it struck my eyes, nose 
or mouth, but I can read intent 
in the mind long before it is committed, long before I see the person, in fact ... at the moment 
your wife is answering a call 
from a reporter at the Brentwood 
Times. I can follow the telephone 
lines through the phone company 
to his office. And Mrs. Phillips,'* 
he said, not turning his head, "is 
watching us through a window." 




Prof. Tomlin could see Mrs. 
Phillips at her kitchen window. 




RENT WOOD. 111., overnight 
became a sensation. The 



Brentwood Times sent a reporter 
and photographer out, and the 
next morning every newspaper in 
the U. S. carried the story and 
photograph of George, the robot 
from Zanthar. 

Feature writers from the wire 
services, the syndicates, photographer-reporter combinations from 
national newspicture magazines 
flew to Brentwood and interviewed George. Radio and television and the newsreels cashed in 
on the sudden novelty of a blue 
humanoid. 

Altogether, his remarks were 
never much different from those 
he made to Prof. Tomlin, with 
whom he continued to reside. Yet 
the news sources were amusedly 
tolerant of his views and the 
world saw no menace in him and 
took him in stride. He created no 
problem. 

Between interviews and during 
the long nights, George read all 
the books in the Tomlin library, 
the public library, the university 
library and the books sent to him 
from the state and Congressional 
libraries. He was an object of interest to watch while reading: he 
merely leafed through a book and 
absorbed all that was in it. 

He received letters from old 



T M I SEVENTH ORDER 



and young. Clubs were named 
for him. Novelty companies put 
out statue likenesses of him. He 
was, in two weeks, a national 
symbol as American as corn. He 
was liked by most, feared by a 
few, and his habits were daily 
news stories. 

Interest in him had begun to 
wane in the middle of the third 
week when some thing put him 
in the headlines again — he killed 
a man. 

It happened one sunny afternoon when Prof. Tomlin had returned from the university and 
he and George sat on the front 
porch for their afternoon chat. 
It was far from the informal chat 
of the first day, however. The 
talk was being recorded for radio 
release later in the day. A television camera had been set up, 
focused on the two and nearly 
a dozen newsmen lounged around, 
notebooks in hand. 

"You have repeatedly mentioned, George, that some of your 
kind may leave Zanthar for 
Earth. Why should any like you 
— why did you, in fact leave your 
planet? Aren't you robots happy 
there?" 

"Of course." George said, making certain the TV camera was 
trained on him before continuing. 
"It's just that we've outgrown 
the place. We've used up all our 
raw materials. By now everyone 
on Earth mu*t be familiar with 



the fact that we intend to set up 
a station here as we have on 
many other planets, a station to 
manufacture more of us. 

"Every inhabitant will work for 
the perpetuation of the Seventh 
Order, mining metals needed, fabricating parts, performing thousands of useful tasks in order to 
create humanoids like me. From 
what I have learned about Earth, 
you ought to produce more than 
a million of us a year." 

"But you'll never get people to 
do that." the professor said. 
"Don't you understand that?" 

"Once the people learn that we 
are the consummation of all creative thinking, that we are all 
that man could ever hope to be, 
that we are the apotheosis, they 
will be glad to create more of us." 

"Apotheosis?" Prof. Tomlin repeated. "Sounds like megalomania to me." 

The reporters' pencils scribbled. 
The tape cut soundlessly across 
the magnetic energizers of the recorders. The man at the gain 
control didn't flicker an eyelash. 

"You don't really believe that. 
Professor. Instead of wars as a 
goal, the creation of Seventh Order Humanoids will be the 
Earth's crowning and sublime 
achievement. Mankind will be 
supremely happy. Anybody who 
could not be would simply prove 
himself neurotic and would have 
to be dealt with.'*

"You will use force?" 

The reporters' grips on their 
pencils tightened. Several looked 
up
"How does one deal with the insane, Professor Tomlin?'* the robot asked confidently. "They will, 
simply have to be — processed." 

"You'll have to process the 
whole Earth, then. You'll have to 
include me, too." 

The robot gave a laugh. "I admire your challenging spirit, Professor." 

"What you arc saying is that 
you, a single robot, intend to 
conquer the Earth and make its 
people do your bidding." 

"Not alone. I may have to ask 
for help when the time comes, 
when I have evaluated the entire 
planet." 

TT was at this moment that a 
■ young man strode uncertainly 
up the walk. There were so many 
strangers about that no one challenged him until he edged toward 
the porch, unsteady on his feet. 
He was drunk. 

"Thersha robod I'm afer," he 
observed intently. ^ "We'll shee 
aboud how he'll take lead." He 
reached into his pocket and 
pulled out a gun. 

There was a flash, as if a 
soundless explosion had occurred. 
The heat accompanying it was 
blistering, but of short duration. 
When everyone's eyes had be


come accustomed to the afternoon light again, there was a 
burned patch on the sidewalk and 
grass was charred on either side. 
There was a smell of broiled meat 
in the air — and no trace of the 
man. 

The nejrt moment newsmen 
were on their feet and photographers' bulbs were flashing. The 
TV camera swept to the spot on 
the sidewalk. An announcer was 
explaining what had happened, 
his voice trained in rigid control, 
shocked with horror and fright. 

Moments later sirens screamed 
and two police cars came into 
sight. They screeched to the curb 
and several officers jumped out 
and ran across the lawn. 

While this was going on, Prof. 
Tomlin sat white-faced and unmoving in his chair. The robot 
was silent. 

When it had been explained to 
the policemen, five officers advanced toward the robot. 

"Stop where you are," George 
commanded. "It is true that I 
killed a man, much as any of you 
would have done if you had been 
in my place. I can see in your 
minds what you are intend-** to 
say, that you must arrest r"* — " 

Prof. Tomlin found his ce. 
"George, we will all h*ave to testify that you killed with that 
force or whatever it is you have. 
But it will be self-defense, which 
is justifiable homicide — " 



THE SEVENTH ORDER

George turned to the professor. 
"How little you know your own 
people, Professor Tomlin. Can't 
you see what the issue will be? It 
will be claimed by the state that 
I am not a human being and this 
will he drummed into every brain 
in the land. The fine qualities of 
the man I was compelled to destroy will be held up. No, I alreadv know what the outcome 
will fz. I refuse to be arrested." 

■ Prof. Tomlin stood up. "Men," 
he said to the policemen, "do not 
arrest this — this humanoid. To 
try to do so would mean your 
death. I have been with him long 



enough to know what he can do.** 

"You taking his side. Professor?" the police sergeant demanded. 

"No, damn it," snapped the 
Professor. "I'm trying to tell you 
something you might not know." 

"We know he's gone too 
damned far,*' the sergeant replied. "I think it was Dick Knight 
that he killed. Nobody in this 
town can kill a good guy like 
Dick Knight and get away with 
it." He advanced toward the robot, drawing his gun. 

"I'm warning you — " the Professor started to say. 




7= 




 



But it was too late. There was 
another blinding, scorching flash, 
more burned grass, more smell 
of seared flesh. 

The police sergeant disappeared. 

"Gentlemen!" George said, 
standing. "Don't lose your 
heads!" 

But he was talking to a retreating group of men. Newsmen 
walked quickly to what they 
thought was a safe distance. The 
radio men silently packed their 
gear. The TV cameras were rolled 
noiselessly away. 

Prof. Tomlin, alone on the 



porch with the robot, turned to 
him and said, "Much of what 
you have told me comes to have 
new meaning, George. I understand what you mean when you 
talk about people being willing to 
work for your so-called Seventh 
Order." 

"I knew you were a better than 
average man, Professor Tomlin," 
the humanoid said, nodding with 
gratification. 

"This is where I get off, George. 
I'm warning you now that you'd 
better return to your ship or 
whatever it is you came in. People 
just won't stand for what you've

'iene. They don't like murder!"' 

"I cannot return to my ship,** 
George said. "I destroyed it when 
I arrived. Of course I could instruct some of you how to build 
another for me, but I don't intend to leave, anyway." 

"You will be killed then." 

"Come, now. Professor Tomlm. 
You know better than that." 

**If someone else can't, then 
perhaps I can." 

"Fine!" The robot replied jovially. "That's just what I want 
you to do. Oppose me. Give me 
a real test of your ability. If you 
find it impossible to kill me— 
and I'm sure you will — then I 
doubt if anyone else will be able 
to.** 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
puffed hard at it. "The trouble 
with you," he said, eying the humanoid evenly, "is that your 
makers forgot to give you a conscience." 

"Needless baggage, a conscience. One of your Fifth Order 
failings." 

"You will leave here . . .** 

"Of course. Under the circumstances, and because of your attitude, you are of very little use 
to me now. Professor Tomlin." 

The robot walked down the 
steps. People attracted by the 
police car made a wide aisle for 
him to the street. 

They watched him as he 
walked out of sight. 



T^HAT night there was a mass 
-■- meeting in the university's 
Memorial Gymnasium, attended 
by several hundred men. They 
walked in and silently took their 
seats, some on the playing floor, 
others in the balcony over the 
speaker's platform. There was 
very little talking ; the air was 
tense. 

On the platform at the end of 
the gyn were Mayor Harry 
Winters, Chief of Police Sam 
Higgins, and Prof. Ansel Tomlin. 

"Men," the mayor began, 
"there is loose in our city a being 
from another world whom I'm 
afraid we took too lightly a few 
days ago. I am speaking of the 
humanoid — George of Zanthar. 
It is obvious the machine means 
business. He evidently came in 
with one purpose — to prepare 
Earth for others just like him to 
follow. He is testing us. He has, 
as you know, killed two men. 
Richard Knight, who may have 
erred in attacking the machine, is 
nonetheless dead as a result — 
killed by a force we do not understand. A few minutes later 
Sergeant Gerald Phillips of the 
police force was killed in the performance of his duty, trying to 
arrest the humanoid George for 
the death of Mr. Knight. We are 
here to discuss what we can do 
about George." 

He then introduced Prof. Tomlin who told all he knew about 



74 




 




one else suggested, frantically. 



the blue man. his habits, his 
brain, the experiences with him 
for the past two and a half weeks. 

"If we could determine the 
source of his power, it might be 
possible to cut it off or to cur-r 
tail it. He might be rendered at 
least temporarily helpless and, 
while in such a condition, possibly be done away with. He has 
told me he is vulnerable to 
force, such as a speeding bullet, 
if it hit the right spot, but George 
possesses the ability to read intent long before the commission 
of an act. The person need not 
even be in the room. He is probably listening to me here now, although he may be far away." 

The men looked at one another, 
shifted uneasily on their seats, 
and a few cast apprehensive eyes 
at the windows and doorways. 

"Though he is admittedly a superior creature possessed of powers beyond our comprehension, 
there must be a weak spot in his 
armor somewhere. I have dedicated myself to finding that weakness." 

The chair recognized a man in 
the fifth row. 

"Mr. Mayor, why don't we all 
track him down and a lot of us 
attack him at once? Some of us 
would die, sure, but he couldn't 
strike us alt dead at one time. 
Somebody's bound to succeed." 

"Why not try a high-powered 
rifle from a long way oft'?" some


"Let's bomb him," still another 
offered. 

The mayor waved them quiet 
and turned to Prof. Tomlin. The 
professor got to his feet again. 

"I'm not sure that would work, 
gentlemen," he said. "The humanoid is able to keep track of 
hundreds of things at the same 
time. No doubt he could unleash 
his power in several direction* 
almost at once." 

"But we don't know!" 

"It's worth a try!" 

At that moment George walked 
into the room and the clamor 
died at its height. He went noiselessly down an aisle to the platform, mounted it and turned to 
the assembly. He was a magnificent blue figure, eyes flashing, 
chest out, head proud. He eyed 
them all. 

"You are working yourselves up 
needlessly," he said quietly. "It 
is not my intention, nor is it the 
intention of any Seventh Order 
Humanoid, to kill or cause suffering. It's simply that you do not 
understand what it would mean 
to dedicate yourselves to the fulfillment of the Seventh Order 
destiny. It is your heritage, yours 
because you have advanced in 
your technology so far that Earth 
has been chosen by us as a station. You will have the privilege 
of creating us. To give you such 
a worthwhile goal in your short 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



lives 5s actually doing you a service — a service far outweighed by 
any of your citizens. Beside a 
Seventh Order Humanoid, your 
Jives are unimportant in the great 
cosmic scheme of things — " 

"If they're so unimportant, why 
did you bother to take two of 
them?" 

"Yeah. Why don't you bring 
back Dick Knight and Sergeant 
Phillips?" 

"Do you want to be buried 
lying down or standing up?" 

The collective courage rallied. 
There were catcalls and hoots, 
stamping of feet. 

Suddenly from the balcony 
over George's head a man leaned 
over, a metal folding chair in his 
hands, aiming at George's head. 
An instant later the man disappeared in a flash and the chair 
dropped toward George. He 
moved only a few inches and the 
chair thudded to the platform before him. He had not looked up. 

For a moment the crowd sat 
stunned. Then they rose and 
started for the blue man. Some 
drew guns they had brought. The 
hall was filled with blinding 
flashes, with smoke, with a horrible stench, screams, swearing, 
cries of fear and pain. There was 
a rush for the exits. Some died 
at the feet of their fellow men. 

In the end, when all were gone, 
George of Zanthar still stood on 



the platform, alone. There was no 
movement except the twitching of 
the new dead, the trampled, on 
the floor. 

EVENTS happened fast after 
that. The Illinois National 
Guard mobilized, sent a division 
to Brentwood to hunt George 
down. He met them at the city 
square. They rumbled in and 
trained machine guns and tank 
rifles on him. The tanks and personnel flashed out of existence before a shot was fired. 

Brentwood was ordered evacuated. The regular Army was 
called in. Reconnaissance planes 
reported George was still standing in the city square. Jet planes 
materialized just above the hills 
and made sudden dives, but before their pilots could fire a shot, 
they were snuffed out of the air 
in a burst of fire. 

Bombers first went over singly, 
only to follow the jets* fate, A 
squadron bloomed into a fiery 
ball as it neared the target. A 
long-range gun twenty miles 
away was demolished when its 
ammunition blew up shortly before firing. 

Three days after George had 
killed his first man, action ceased. 
The countryside was deathly still. 
Not a living person could be seen 
for several miles around. But 
George still stood patiently in the 



•AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



square. He stood there for three 
more days and yet nothing happened. 

On the fourth day, he sensed 
that a solitary soldier had started 
toward the city from five miles to 
the east. In his mind's eye he 
followed the soldier approaching 
the city. The soldier, a sergeant, 
was bearing a white flag that fluttered in the breeze; he was not 
armed. After an hour he saw the 
sergeant enter the square and 
walk toward him. When they 
were within twenty feet of one 
another, the soldier stopped and 
saluted. 

"Major General Pitt requests 
a meeting with you, sir," the 
soldier said, trembling and trying 
hard not to. 

"Do not be frightened," George 
said. "I see you intend me no 
harm." 

The soldier reddened. "Wilt 
you accompany me?" 
"Certainly." 

The two turned toward the east 
and started to walk. 

T7MVK miles east of Brentwood 
lies a small community named 
Minerva. Population: 200. The 
highway from Brentwood to Chicago cuts the town in two. In the 
center of town, on the north side 
of the road, stands a new building — the Minerva Town Hall — 
built the year before with money 
raised by the residents. It was 



the largest and most elabota^ * 
building in Minerva, which ha . 
been evacuated three days * be fore. 

On this morning the town hall 
was occupied by army men. Maj. 
Gen. Pitt fretted and fumed at 
the four officers and twenty enlisted men waiting in the building. 

"It's an indignity!" he railed 
at the men who were forced to 
listen to him. "We have orders to 
talk appeasement with him! Nuts' 
We lose a few men, a few planer 
and now we're ready to mee George halfway. What's the 
country coming to? There ough" 
to be something that would knoc : 
him out. Why should we have t . 
send in after him? It's disgusting!" 

The major general, a large man 
with a bristling white mustache 
and a red face, stamped back and 
forth in the council room. Some 
of the officers and men smiled to 
themselves. The general was a 
well known fighting man. Orders 
he had received hamstrung him 
and, as soldiers, they sympathized 
with him. 

"What kind of men do we have 
in the higher echelons?" He asked 
everybody in general and nobody 
in particular. "They won't eve 
let us have a field telephon . 
We're supposed to make a repot 
by radio. Now isn't that smart? 
He shook his head, looked the 
men over. "An appeasement team. 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



that's what you arc, when you 
ought to be a combat team to 
lick hell out of George. 

"Why were you all assigned to 
this particular duty? I never saw 
any of you before and I understand you're all strangers to each 
other, too. Hell, what will they do 
next? Appeasement. I never appeased anybody before in my 
whole life. I'd rather spit in his 
eye. What am I supposed to talk 
about? The weather? What authority do I have to yak with a 
walking collection of nuts and 
bolts!" 

An officer strode into the room 
and saluted the general. "They're 
coming, sir," he said. 

"Who's coming? . . . My God, 
man," the general spluttered angrily, "be specific. Who the hell 
are 'they'?" 

"Why, George and Sergeant 
Matthews, sir. You remember, the 
sergeant who volunteered to go 
into Brentwood — " 

"Oh, them. Well, all I have to 
say is this is a hell of a war. I 
haven't figured out what I am going to say yet." 

"Shall I have them wait, sir?" 

"Hell, no. Let's get this over 
with. I'll find out what George 
has to say and maybe that'll 
give me a lead." 

Before George entered the 
Council chamber, he already 
knew the mind of each man. He 
saw the room through their eyes. 



He knew everything about them, 
what they were wearing, what 
they were thinking. AH had guns, 
yet none of them would kill him, 
although at least one man, Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, would have liked to. 

They were going to talk appeasement, George knew, but he 
could also see that the general 
didn't know what line the conversation would take or what 
concessions he could make on 
behalf of his people. 

Wait — there was one man 
among the twenty-three who had 
an odd thought. It was a soldier 
he had seen looking through a 
window at him. This man was 
thinking about eleven o'clock, for 
George could see in the man's 
mind various symbols for fifteen 
minutes from then — the hands 
of a clock, a watch, the numerals 
11. But George could not see any 
significance to the thought. 

When he entered the room with 
the sergeant, he was ushered to 
a table. He sat down with Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, who glowered at him. 
Letting his mind roam the room, 
George picked up the numerals 
again and identified the man 
thinking them as the officer behind and a little to the right of 
the general. 

What was going to happen at 
eleven? The man had no conscious thought of harm to anyone, 
yet the idea kept obtruding and 
seemed so out of keeping with his 



n 




 




Other thoughts George assigned 
several of his circuits to the man. 
The fact that the lieutenant 
looked at his watch and saw that 
it was 10:50 steeled George still 
more. If there was to be trouble, 
it would come from this one man. 

"I'm General Pitt," the general 
said drily. "You're George, of 
course. I have been instructed to 
ask you what, exactly, your intentions are toward the United 
States and the world in general, 
with a view toward reaching some 
sort of agreement with you and 
others of your kind, who will, as 
you say invade the Earth." 

"Invade, General Pitt," George 
replied, "is not the word." 

"All right, whatever the word 
is. We're all familiar with the 
plan you've been talking about. 
What we want to know is. where 
do you go from here?" 

, "The fact that there has been 
no reluctance on the part of the 
armed forces to talk of an agreement — even though I see that you 
privately do not favor such a talk, 
General Pitt — is an encouraging 
sign. We of Zanthar would not 
want to improve a planet which 
could not be educated and would 
continually oppose our program. 
This will make it possible for 
me to turn in a full report in a 
few days now." 

"Will you please get to the 
point?" 

George could see that the lieu


THE SEVENTH ORDER

tenant was looking at his watch 
again. It was 10:58. George 
spread his mind out more than 
twenty miles, but could find no 
installation, horizontally or vertically, that indicated trouble. 
None of the men in the room 
seemed to think of becoming 
overly hostile. 

"Yes. General. After my message goes out, there ought to be 
a landing party on Earth within 
a few weeks. While waiting for 
the first party, there must be certain preparations — " 

George tensed. The lieutenant 
was reaching for something. But 
it somehow didn't seem connected 
with George. It was something 
white, a handkerchief. He saw 
|hat the man intended to blow his 
nose and started to relax except 
that George suddenly became 
aware of the fact the man did not 
need to blow his nose! 

Every thought-piercing circuit 
became instantly energized in 
George's mind and reached out 
in all directions . . , 

There were at least ten shots 
from among the men. They stood 
there surprised at their actions. 
Those who had fired their guns 
now held the smoking weapons 
awkwardly in their hands. 

George's eyes were gone. Smoke 
curled upward from the two 
empty sockets where bullets had 
entered a moment before. The 
smoke grew heavier and his body 



became hot. Some of him turned 
cherry red and the chair on which 
he had been sitting started to 
burn. Finally, he collapsed toward the table and rolled to the 
floor. 

He started to cool. He was no 
longer the shiny blue-steel color 
he had been — he had turned 
black. His metal gave off cracking 
noises and some of it buckled 
here and there as it cooled. 

A FEW minutes later, tense 
military men and civilians 
grouped around a radio receiver 
in Chicago heard the report and 
relaxed, laughing and slapping 
each other on the back. Only one 
sat unmoved in a corner. Others 
finally sought him out. 

"Well, Professor, it was your 
idea that did the trick. Don't 
you feel like celebrating?" one 
of them asked. 

Prof. Tomlin shook his head. 
"If only George had been a little 
more benign, we might have 
learned a lot from him." 

"What gave you the idea that 
killed him?" 

"Oh, something he said about 
the unconscious and subconscious," Prof. Tomlin replied. "He 
admitted they were not penetrable. It was an easy matter to 
instill a post-hypnotic suggestion 
in some proven subjects and then 
to erase the hypnotic experience." 
"You make it sound easy."

**It wasn't too difficult, really. 
It was finding the solution that 
was hard. We selected more than 
a hundred men, worked with them 
for dayg, finally singled out the 
best twenty, then made them forget their hypnosis. A first lieutenant — I've forgotten his name — 
had implanted in him a command 
even he was not aware of. His 
subconscious made him blow his 
nose fifteen minutes after he saw 
George. Nearly twenty others had 
post-hypnotic commands to shoot 
George in the eyes as soon as 
they saw the lieutenant blow his 
nose. Of course we also planted 
a subconscious hate pattern, 
which wasn't exactly necessary, 
just to make sure there would 
be no hesitation, no inhibition, 
no limiting moral factorr 

"None of the men ever saw each 
other before being sent to 
Minerva. None realized that they 
carried with them the order for 



George's annihilation. The general, who was not one of the 
hypnotics, was given loose instructions, as were several others, 
so they could not possibly know 
the intention. Those of us who 
had conducted the hypnosis had 
to stay several hundred miles 
away so that we could not be 
reached by George's prying 
mind ..."
