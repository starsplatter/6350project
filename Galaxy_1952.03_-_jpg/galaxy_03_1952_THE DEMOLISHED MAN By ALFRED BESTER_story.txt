THE DEMOLISHED MAN By ALFRED BESTER 

AS the Ampro Queen ponder ously circled the hodgeJ » podge in space that was 
the amusement center of the Solar 
System (Ampro — Amusement 
Protectorate) and the unofficial 
neutral territory, the ventral 
hatch opened and dozens of landing launches swept up through 
space to lodge inside her belly. 
Then the hatch closed, the central staging hall was refilled with 
air, and the passengers permitted 

104 



to enter from the- ships' ramps. 

The staging hall was a domed 
cavern, five hundred feet long, a 
hundred wide and fifty feet to the 
peak. You carried your luggage 
from your stateroom down to the 
staging hall . . . and that was 
the beginning of the wild frenzy 
of your vacation at Ampro. 

Thirty launches with crystal 
sightseeing ports rested on the 
floor. They were painted in garish 
colors and each prominently displayed the name of the hotel 
that had sent it. The smaller hotels had to be content with single 
barkers, but the more prosperous 
establishments sent entire acts. 
On top of the Victoria launch, 
for example, was a troupe of 
trampoline acrobats in violent 
free-flight. The Victoria catered 
to a muscle clientele. The Magic 
launffh had sixteen lovely mermaids droning deafeningly on 
harps. The Sportsman displayed 
an energetic clown in ludicrous 
cap, sweater and plus-fours who 
putted small white balls to the 
tourists. Each ball was a sphere 
of soft plastic which spoke in a 
faint, tinny, voice; "For the best 
in sports, come to the Sportsman. 
Sovereign a day for single, and 
up." 

Powell threaded his way 
through the crowds and entered 
the small black police launch. 
Sergeant Al Bible was waiting 
despondently for him. 

"We loused it," Bible said. 

A warning bell clanged. The 
launch sealed up and, as the 
ventral hatch opened, it dropped 
into space. Powell glanced out 
of the port at Ampro glittering 
below like a patchwork quilt 
worked in silver and gilt. 

Ampro had started generations 
back with a flat plate of meteoric 
rock half a mile in diameter. A 
health cultist had raised a transparent hemisphere of Air-Gel on 
the plate, installed an atmosphere 
generator and started a colony. 
From that, Ampro had grown into 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



an irregular table in space, extending hundreds of miles. Each 
new entrepreneur had simply 
tacked another mile or so onto 
the shelf, raised his own transparent hemisphere and gone into 
business. By the time engineers 
got around to advising Ampro 
that the spherical form was more 
efficient and economical, it was 
too late to change. The table just 
went on adding new hemisphf-res 
like a mass of giant soap bubbles 
on a bright checkerboard. 

The various planetary and 
satellitic colonies attempted to 
reproduce the environments of 
their homes. "Mars From Home" 
was reddish and wasted, but with 
the added luxury of lakes of blue 
water. "Venus From Home" was 
misty. On the Jupiter side of the 
table was the giant hundred mile 
hemisphere that covered the 
Ampro Nature Reservation which 
guaranteed more natural history 
and weather per square mile than 
any planet. 

"Let's have the story, Al," Powell said. 

Bible gulped. "We followed instructions. Rough tail on Hassop, 
slickie following him. The rough 
got taken out by Reich's girl . . " 

"It was a girl, eh?" 

"Cute little trick named Duffy 
Wyg&." 

Powell jerked upright. "Why, 
I questioned that girl myself! I 
never — " He caught himself and 
shook his head. "Seems I dfd 

105 



some lousing myself, Al. Shows 
you when you meet a pretty girl, 
- look out!" 

"Well, like I say," Bible continued, "she takes out the rough, 
and just when the slickie moves 
in. Reich jets into Arnpro with a 
commotion." 

"Lilft?" 

"Private yacht. Has a crash in 
space and limps in hollerin* 
emergency. One killed. Three injured, including Reich. Front of 
the yacht stove in. Derelict or 
meteor stray. They take Reich 
to the hospital where we figure 
he's planted for a little. When 
we turn around, Reich's gone. 
Hassop too. I grab a peeper interpreter and go looking in four 
Solar languages. No dice." 
v'Hassop's luggage?" 
Gone likewise." 

"Damnation ! We've got to 
pinch Hassop and that luggage, 
Al. They're our motive. Hassop 
is Sacrament's Code : Chief. We 
need him for that last message 
Reich sent to D'Courtney and the 
reply ..." 

"Monday before the murder?" 

"Yes. That exchange probably 
ignited the killing. And Hassop's 
got Reich's financial records with 
him. They can probably tell a 
court why Reich had a hell of a 
motive for murdering D'Courtney." 

"Such as?" ... 

"The talk around Sacrament is 
that D'Courtney had Reich with 



his back clear against the wall." 

"You find method and opportunity?" 

"Yes and no. I opened up 
Jerry Clyurch and got everything, 
but it's ticklish. We can show 
Reich had the opportunity. We 
can show the murder method. 
Same goes for Reich's nmtive. 
But they're like three wigwam 
poles — each stands if the other 
two do. That's Mr. Peetcy's 
opinion. And that's why we need 
Hassop." 

"I'll swear they ain't left 
Ampro. That efficient I still am." 

"Don't hang your head because 
Reich outsmarted you. He's outsmarted plenty. Me included." 

Bible shook his head gloomily. 

"I'll start peeping Ampro for 
Reich and Hassop at once," Powell said as the launch drifted 
down for the passage through the 
airlock, "but I want to check a 
hunch first. Show me the corpse." 

"What corpse?" 

"From Reich's crash." 

In the police mortuary, displayed on an air-cushion in the 
stasis -freeze, the corpse was a 
mangled figure with dead white 
skin and a flaming red beard. 

"Uh-huh," Powell muttered. 
"Keno Quizzard." 

"You know him?" 

"A gimpster. Was working for 
Reich and turned too fiot to be 
useful. What'll you bet that crash 
was a cover-up for a killing?" 

"Hell !" Bible exploded. "Those 



MM 






two other guys are hurt bad and 

the yacht was ruined!" 

"So they were hurt and the 
yacht was ruined. So what? Quizzard's mouth is shut for keeps 
and Reich's that much safer. A 
cheap price for Reich to pay. It 
was a phony, A I. We started 
Quizzard running. Reich intercepted and took care of him. We'll 
never prove it, but we won't have 
to if we locate Hassop. That'll 
be enough to walk friend Reich 
into the Demolition Chamber.

Discouraged, Powell dropped 
into Solar Dawn Cemetery for a 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



food laugh. The cemetery looked 
like an English garden, all flagged 
paths and trees with tiny little 
plots of green grass. Muted music 
from robot quartets, made up as 
musical greats of the past. 
Beethoven, Tchaikowsky, Palestrina and Bix Beiderbeck incongruously under one roof, 
Armstrongs Caruso, Wagner and 
Florence Foster Jenkins under 
another. Powell began to smile. 

There was an accurate reproduction of the Notre Dame Cathedral in the center of the cemetery. From the mouth of on? of 
the gargoyles in the tower, a 
syrupy voice roared : "See the 
drama of the gods portrayed in 
vibrant robot-action! Moses on 
Mt. Sinai, the Crucifixion of 
Christ, Mohammed and the 
mountain, Lao Tse and the Moon, 
the Revelation of Mary Baker 
Eddy, the Ascension of our Lord 
Buddha, the Unveiling of the 
true and only god Galaxy ..." 
Pause, and then a little more 
matter -of -factly: "Owing to the 
sacred nature of this exhibit, admission is by ticket only. Tickets 
may be purchased from the Bailiff." A click, and another gargoyle 
began in another language. Powell's smile turned to a grin. 

Each of the green plots contained a crystal panel ten feet 
square, the ceiling of a stasis 
room in which the departed were 
displayed to eternity in their pet 
poses amid their favorite sur
W 



foundings. In a boudoir, a loved 
one primped motionlessly before 
m mirror. In a monkish library, a 
bibliophile held a book open 
while he jotted down a marginal 
notation. An amateur pilot swaggered grimly on the bridge of a 
rocket ship. A nature-lover communed with nature. Powell 
laughed. 

"You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself," a girl said behind him. 

Without turning, Powell replied: "I'm sorry. 'No Loud Talking or Laughter.' But don't you 
think this is the most ludicrous 
display of vanity in — " Then the 
pattern of her psyche hit him and 
he spun around. 

"Well, Duffy!" he said. 
Her frown changed to a quick 
■mUe. "Mr. Powell, the boysleuth. You still owe mc a dance." 

"I owe you an apology," Powell said. 

"Delighted. Can't have enough 
of them. What's this one for?" 
"Underestimating you." 
"The story of my life." She 
linked arms and drew him along 
the path. "You took another look 
at me and — ?" 

"I realized you're the cleverest 
person Ben Reich has working 
for him." 

"I am clever. I did do some 
work for Ben. Well?" 

"You took out the tail we had 
on Hassop, Duff y . Congratula tions." 

Her pert face looked up at him, 



half serious, half amused. "What 
in hell are you talking about?" 

"We had a tail on Hassop. A 
tail is a secret agent assigned to 
the duty of following a suspect." 

"Contents noted. What's a 
Hassop?" 

"A man who works for Ben 
Reich. His Code Chief." 

"And what did I do to your 
spy?" 

"Following instructions from 
Ben Reich, you captivated the 
man, turned him into a derelict 
from duty, kept him at a piano 
day after day — " 

"Wait a minute!" Duffy said 
sharply. "The little goon was a 
cop?" 

"He was." 

"Following this Hassop?" 
"Yes." 

"Hassop . . . Bleached man? 
Dusty hair? Dusty blue eyes?'" 
Powell nodded. 

"The louse," Duffy muttered. 
"And you think I'm the kind 
that does his dirty work, don't 
you! Why, you — you peeper! I 
make enough money to keep 
peepers! Reich asked me to do 
him a favor. Said there was a 
man up here working on an interesting musical code. Wanted 
me to check him. How was \ 
supposed to know it was your 
goon masquerading as a musician?" 

Powell stared at her. "Are you 
claiming that Reich tricked you?" 
She glared back. "Go ahead 




 



and peep me. I| Reich wasn't in 
the Reservation, you could peep 
that doublecrossing — " 

"Hold it!" Powell interrupted 
sharply. He peeped her precisely 
and comprehensively, then turned 
and began to run. 

"Hey!" Duffy yelled. "What's 
the verdict?" 

"Medal of Honor," Powell 
called over his shoulder. "I'll pin 
it on as soon as I bring a man 
back alive." 

"I don't want a man. I want 
you." 

"That's your trouble, Duffy. 
You want anybody." 
"Who?" 
"An-y-bod-y." 

"No loud talking or laughter, 
please!" 

T>OWELL found Sergeant Bible 
* in the Ampro Globe Theater 
where Diana Clerisy, the magnificent Esper actress, stirred 
thousands with her performances. 
Bible, immune to Miss Clerisy's 
appeal, was gloomily inspecting 
the house face by face. Powell 
took his arm and led him out. 

"He's in the Reservation," 
Powell said. "Took Hassop with 
him. Took Hassop's luggage, too. 
Perfect alibi. He was shaken up 
by the crash and he needs a rest. 
Also company. He's eight hours 
ahead of us." 

"The Reservation, huh?" Bible 
pondered. "Two hundred and 
fifty square miles of more damned 



animals, geography and weather 
than anywhere else." 

"If we want to get Hassop out, 
we'll have to grab a helio and do 
some fast hunting." 

"No mechanical transportation 
allowed in the Reservation." 

"This is an emergency! Peetcy'a 
got to have Hassop!" 

"Let Peetcy argue with the 
Ampro Board. You could get special permission in maybe threefour weeks." 

"By which time Hassop'd be 
dead and buried. What about 
radar or sonar? We could work 
out Hassop's pattern and — " 

"No devices outside of cameras. You hike on your own feet. 
You carry your own food. You 
take one Defensive Barrier Screen 
with you so's the animals don't 
eat you. If you want a fire, you 
got to bujld it. If you want to 
hunt, you got to make your own 
weapons. You versus nature. And 
they make you sign a release in 
case nature wins." 

"Then how are we going to 
find Hassop?" 

"Sign a release and go hike 
for him." 

"The two of us? Cover 250 
square miles of geography? How 
many cops can you spare?" 

"Maybe ten." 

"Twenty-five square miles per 
cop. Impossible." 

"Maybe you could persuade 
the Ampro Board — No. Even if 
you could, we wouldn't be able 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



lot 



to get them together in less than 
a week. Could you get 'em together by maybe peeping 'em?" 

"We can't transmit to anybody 
except another peeper, so — Hey! 
That's an idea. Is a human being 
a rr> r ~hanical device?" 

"?'nt lately." 

"Then I'm going to do some 
fast co-opting and take my own 
radar into the Reservation." 

WHICH is why a sudden craving for nature overtook a 
prominent lawyer in the midst of 
delicate contractual negotiations 
in one of Ampro's luxurious conference rooms. The same craving 
also came upon the secretary of a 
famous author, a judge of domestic relations, a job analyst 
screwing applicants • for the 
United Hotel Association, an industrial designer, an efficiency 
engineer, the chairman of< Amalgamated Union's Grievance Committee, Titan's superintendent of 
cybernetics, a secretary of political 
psychology, two Cabinet members, five Parliamentary leaders, 
and scores of other Esper clients 
of Ampro at work and at play. 

They filed through the Reservation gate in a unified mood of 
holiday festivity and assorted 
clothes. Those that had gotten 
word on the grapevine early 
enough were in sturdy camping 
clothes. Others were not; and the 
astonished gate guards, checking 
and inspecting for illicit baggage. 



saw one lunatic in full diplomatic 
panoply march through with a 
pack on his back. But all the 
nature-lovers carried detailed 
maps of the Reservation carefully 
zoned into sectors." 

Moving swiftly, they spread 
out and beat forward across the 
miniature cosmos of weather and 
geography. The Telepathic Band 
crackled as comments and information swept up and back the 
line of living radar in which Powell occupied the central position. 

"Snowing here. Full blizzard." 

"Swamps and (.Ugh!) mosquitoes my way." 

"Does anyone know what a 
rattlesnake looks like?" 

"Don't bite it, your honor." 

"More damn nature ..." 

"Party ahead, Pres. Sector 9." 

"Let's have the picture" 

"Here it comes . . " 

"No sale," 

"Party ahead, Pres. Sector 17." 
"Shoot a picture, Mr. Chair~

"It's a bear!" 

"Call that a bear? Now up on 
Titan — " 

"I'm being chased!" 

"Don't run! Negotiate!" 

"Say, V ve got a lake dead 
ahead and I can't swim." 

"There's no lake in your sector, 
Julie. I've got 'em all." 

"Excuse it, please. Just a 
mirage." 

"More damned geography." 

"Party ahead, Pres. Sector 12."

"And you're the thief to do it, 
Powell" 

The departing peepers were 
propelled by a tiger grin. 

HPHIS particular square mile of 
Reservation was jungle, 
swampy, tangled, humid. As 
darkness fell, Powell slowly 
wormed his way toward the glimmering campfixe Reich had built 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



111 



in a clearing alongside a small 
lake. The water was infested with 
hippo, crocodile and swambat. 
The trees and terrain swarmed 
with life. The entire jungle was a 
savage tribute to the brilliance 
of Reservation ecologists who 
could assemble and balance nature on the point of. a pin. In 
tribute to that nature, Reich's 
Defensive Barrier Screen was in 
full operation. 

Powell could hear mosquitoes 
whine as they batted against the 
barrier. He could not risk operating his own, for the screens 
hummed slightly and Reich had 
keen ears. Powell inched forward 
and peeped. * 

Hassop was beglamored by being with Reich. Reich, working 
^feverishly on a crude, powerful 
bow. was passionately planning 
the accident that would take him 
a little further from Demolition. 
It was that bow and the arrows 
that had eaten up the eight hour 
start on Powell. You can't kilt a 
man in a hunting accident unless 
you go hunting. 

As Reich lifted the bow, his 
eyes carefully averted from Hassop, his mind intent on the throbbing heart that was his target, 
Powell drove forward urgently. 
Before he had moved ten feet, 
alarm tripped in Reich's mind 
and the big man was on his feet. 
He whipped a burning branch 
from the fire and hurled the flare 
toward the blackness where Pow


ell was concealed. The idea and 
execution came so quickly that 
Powell could not anticipate the 
action. He would have been fully 
illumined if Reich had not forgotten the barrier. It stopped the 
flaming branch in mid-flight and 
dropped it to the ground. 

"Christ!** Reich cried, and 
swung around abruptly at 
Hassop. 

"What is it, Ben?" 

Reich drew the arrow back to 
the lobe of his ear and held the 
point on Hassop's body. Hassop 
scrambled to his feet. 

"Ben, watch out! You're aiming at me!" 

Hassop leaped to one side unexpectedly as Reich let the arrow 

fly. 

"Ben! For the love of — " Suddenly Hassop realized the intent. 
Running desperately, he smashed 
into the invisible wall as an arrow shot past his shoulder and 
shattered. 

"Ben!" he screamed. 

"You son of a bitch,** Reich 
growled, and notched another 
shaft. 

Powell leaped forward and 
reached the edge of the barrier. 
He could not pass it. Inside, Hassop ran screaming while Reich 
stalked him. 

Powell stepped back into the 
darkness, thinking desperately. 
Hassop's screams had aroused 
the jungle and there was a roaring and an echoing rumble in his 



in 




 



ears. Powell reached out on the 
TP Band, sensing, touching, feeling. There was nothing but blind 
fear, blind rage, blind instinct 
around him. 

"It's worth the chance," Powell 
said to himself. "I've got to bust 
that barrier." 

He set his blocks on the upper 
levels, masking everything except 
fear, terror, fear . . . 

Every bird awoke screaming. 
The monkeys screamed back and 
shook branches in sudden flight. 
A barrage of sucking explosions 
sounded from the lake as hippos 
surged up from the shallows in 
blind terror. The jungle was' 
shaken by the ear-splitting trumpetings of elephants and the 
thunder of their stampede. Reich 
heard and froze, ignoring Hassop, 
who still ran and sobbed, crashing from wall to wall of the 
barrier. 

The hippos hit the barrier first. 
They were followed by the gigantic swambats and the crocodiles. Then came the elephants, 
the wapiti, the zebra, the gnu . . . 
heavy, pounding herds. The manufacturers of the Defensive Barrier Screen had never anticipated 
a stampede like this. Reich's barrier went down with a sound like 
scissored glass. 

The hippos trampled the fire. 
Powell darted through the darkness, seized Hassop's arm, and 
dragged the crazed man across 
the clearing to the piled packs. 



A wild hoof sent him reeling, but 
he held on to Hassop and located 
the precious film cannister. Still 
dragging Hassop, he peeped his 
way through the stampede. 

Behind the thick bole of a 
lignum vitae, Powell paused to 
catch his breath and settle the 
cannister safely in his pocket. 
Hassop was still sobbing. Powell 
sensed Reich, a hundred feet 
away, back against a fever tree, 
bow and arrows clutched in his 
stricken hands. He was confused, 
furious, terrified . . . but still 
safe. Powell wanted to keep him 
safe for Demolition. 

Unhitching his Defensive Screen 
Barrier from his belt, Powell 
tossed it across the clearing toward the embers of the fire where 
Reich would surely find it. Then 
he turned and led the numb, unresisting Code Chief toward the 
gate. 

XIV 

A ND so, at last, the Reich case 
was ready for the District 
Attorney's office and that dreaded 
monster of facts and evidence, 
Mr. Peetcy. 

Powell and his staff assembled 
in Peetcy *s office. A round 
table had been set up in the center, and on it was constructed 
a transparent model of the key 
rooms of Beaumont House, inhabited by miniature android 
figures of the people involved. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



111 



The Lab had done a superlative 

Job ; the models actually resembled the originals. Alongside 
the table was massed the documentation the staff had prepared, 
ready for presentation to the legal ogre. 

Mr. Peetcy himself occupied 
the entire circular wall of his 
giant office. His multitudinous 
eyes winked and glared coldly. 
His prodigious memory whirred 
and hummed. His mouth, the 
cone of a speaker, hung open in 
• kind of astonishment at human 
gtupidity. His hands, the keys 
cf a multiflex typewriter, poised 
over a roll of tape, ready to hammer sense into anybody. Mr. 
Peetcy was the Prosecution 
Transistor Computer of the Distort Attorney's Office, whose awful decisions controlled the 
preparation, presentation and 
prosecution of every police case. 

"We won't bother Peetcy to 
start with," Powell told the D A. 
"Let's take a look at the models 
and check them against the 
Crime Schedule. Your staff has 
the time sheets. If you catch anything our gang's missed, make a 
note." 

He nodded to Kr^t, the harrassed Lab Chief, who touched a 
button. Instantly the model was 
illumined and the dolls came to 
life. Acoustics had faked a background. There was a hint of 
music, laughter and chatter. In 
the main hall of Beaumont House, 



a pneumatic model of Maria 
Beaumont slowly climbed to a 
dais with a tiny book in her 
hands. 

"The time is 11:09 at that 
point," Powell said to the D.A.'s 
staff. "Watch the clock above the 
model. It's geared to synchronize 
with the action." 

In rapt silence, the legal division studied the scene and jotted 
notes while the androids reproduced the actions discovered by 
the Moltecs, reported by the witnesses, and inferred by Powell's 
squad. The lights went out in the 
model house. The miniature game 
of Sardine began. The tiny figure 
of Reich entered the Music Room, 
met Duffy Wyg& and the Chervil 
boy, climbed to the Orchid Suite, 
extinguished the guards and entered the room to encounter 
D'Courtney. The staging of the 
murder surprised the lawyers, 
who made inquiring sounds. 

"Got that material from the 
D'Courtney girl," Powell murmured. "Peeped her. It's authentic/' 

The little drama came to an 
end at last with the stampede of 
the guests from the Panty projection room up to the Orchid 
Suite Where the dolls burst in 
and crowded around the tiny 
dead body. There they froze in 
a grotesque little tableau. 

"And that's the overall picture," Powell said. "Now let's 
take it apart, point for point, and 



6Al«Xf SttlKCE -FICTION 



feed it to Mr. Peetcy. First, opportunity — " 

The office door banged open 
and Commissioner Crabbe 
marched in as though heading a 
parade. Behind him were two 
officers of the Commissioner's 
squad with a sallow, shriveled 
man between them. 

"Mr. Prefect," Crabbe pronounced formally. 

"Mr. Commissioner?" 

"While you and the members 
of your staff have wasted valuable time, the Police Commissioner's office has quietly, efficiently and without fanfare 
performed and executed the official functions which your — " 

"Excuse me, Commissioner," 
Powell interrupted wearily. "We'll 
have the speech another time. 
We're trying to finish off. the 
Reich Case." 

"The Reich Case is ended." 

"Delighted to hear it As of 
when?" 

"One hour ago, when it was 
re-titled the MacGranger Case. 
There," announced the Commissioner, pointing dramatically at 
the shriveled man, "stands Sherman MacGranger, self-confessed 
murderer of Craye D'Courtneyl" 

"Oh, hell, not another one!" 

"This man has confessed to the 
murder and has, with one blow 
of almighty truth, smashed the 
malicious accusation against a 
man as incapable of crime as I 
am!" 



"I killed him," MacGranger 
said. 

"He didn't kill D'Courtney, 
Mr. Commissioner. We know this 
kind. We peep 'em every day." 

"Mr. Prefect, I employed a 
bona fide member of your Guild 
to check MacGranger's confession. He assures me that MacGranger is not lying." 

"The hell you say. Who peeped 
him?" 

"Dr. Alfred Gammon, the eminent psychiatrist who — " 

"Gammon?" $$on repeated. 
"He's a 3rd, a lay psychologist. 
He couldn't peep a cockroach" 

"I killed him," MacGranger 
said. i 

"He's not lying, sir. He — " 

"He's lying to himself, Mr. 
Commissioner," Powell said. 
"He's perfectly sincere, but he 
can't make us believe he's the 
killer. Too many have tried that 
already." 

"What?" 

"Oh, sure. We've had our quota 
of cranks who came busting into 
headquarters hollering for Demolition. How many so far, $$on?" 

"Eighteen. And every one honestly believing he murdered 
D'Courtney." 

"Preposterous." 

"Then the history of Criminal 
Investigation is preposterous, sir. 
There's rarely been a celebrated 
crime when deluded characters 
haven't pestered the police with 
confessions. Some actually got

themselves sentenced. That was 
before TP, of course. Nowadays, 
we protect the innocent from 
themselves. I'm going to protect 
Sherman MacGranger from himself and from you." 

"If you imagine you can pull 
your peeper tricks on me, Powell—" 

"I'll do it with the objective 
evidence." Powell turned to the 
shriveled man. "Who invited you 
to the Beaumont party?" 

"I killed him," MacGranger 
«aid. 

"All right, you killed him. How 
Ad you get in?" 

"I crashed." 

"As a servant?" 

MacGranger smiled craftily. 
"No, as a guest." 

those clothes?" 

"The kind Maria Beaumont 
likes. Skintight leotards." 

"Did you know where D'Courtney was?" 

Without hesitation, MacGranger pointed to the Orchid Suite. 
"He was a lousy, stinkin' crook 
and I killed him right there!" 

"How did you get up there to 
kill him?" 

"In the Sardine game." 

"How did you play Sardine?" 

"We put out all the lights and 
one person was It and she went 
hiding. Everybody went looking 
for her and when they found her, 
they hid with her. Finally only 
one was left all alone in the dark 
wandering around wondering 



where everybody was and I went 
Bp and killed that dirty son — " 
"Are you peeping him?" Powell 
asked $$on. "Magnificent! The 
paranoid's paranoiac. He's gotten 
all that material from the Pantys, 
but he really believes he was 
there." 

"Never mind your aspersions, 
Mr. Prefect," Crabbe said angrily. 
"You have not shaken MacGranger's confession by one iota." 

"Haven't you noticed his mistake yet? I'll point it up for you. 
How did you murder D' Courtney, 
MacGranger?" 

"An infinite ray." 

"There's no such animal." 

"I invented it." 

"MacGranger's a mechanic,** 
Crabbe cut in hastily. "He's described his invention to me. We 
will have technicians pass on it 
*t a later — *' 

"I've peeped his picture of the 
weapon. Describe it for the staff, 
Mr. Commissioner." 

"Well, it's a power-pack projector. It has a double hand grip 
because the recoil is apparently 
tremendous. A projector of such 
power would be required to blow 
out D'Courtney's head, as actually happened." 

"Sure," Powell replied casually. "Now ask him where he 
concealed it." 

Crabbe stared. 

"Clever up, Commissioner. He 
was in skintight leotards. Where 
did he conceal a two-handed 



114 




 



power-pack 'infinite ray* projector? Not in leotards- A dirk, 
maybe, but not the machine 
you've described." 

"My God!" Crabbe exclaimed 
faintly. "I — I never — " 

"Well, MacGranger?" Powell 
asked kindly. "What's the answer?" 

* The shriveled maja burst into 
tears. Crabbe angrily hauled him 
out of the room and came back 
alone, not particularly mollified. 

Powell turned to his staff. 
"Let's get back to work. We'll 
feed everything to Peetcy for 
an opinion. First, opportunity. 
There's no argument with the 
Moltecs. Reich went up twice as 
indicated in the model — once to 
kill, a second time with the posse. 
You lawyers have any beefs on 
that?" 

"That Sardine game," the D.A. 
said. 

"Reich bought the book, sent it 
to Beaumont." 

"How'd he know she'd play 
Sardine?" 

"He knew she liked games. Sardine was the only completely 
legible one in the book." 

The D.A. scratched his head. 
"Peetcy takes a lot of convincing. 
Won't do any harm to try it on, 
though." 

Crabbe, whose aplomb made 
quick recoveries, burst out: "Gentlemen, I have never approved of 
the use of that mechanical monster." 



$$on began feeding the punched, 
data into Peetcy'.s ear. "You're 
absolutely right, Commissioner." 

"Now about method," said 
Powell. "First question: How'd 
Reich knock out the guards? 
Kr^t?" 

"And furthermore, gentlemen. 
..." Crabbe continued. 

"Rhodopsin Ionizer," Kr^t 
cut in. He handed a plastic sphere 
to Powell, who exhibited it. "Man 
named J^Jniaine developed it for 
Reich's private police. I've got 
the empiric processing formula 
ready for Peetcy, and the sample 
we mocked up. Anybody care to 
try it?" 

The D.A. looked dubious. "I 
don't see the use. Peetcy can 
decide about that." 

"In addition to which, gentlemen ..." 

"Oh, come on, Crabbe," Kr^t 
said with unpleasant cheerfulness. "You'll never believe us unless you see it for yourself. It' 
doesn't hurt. Just makes you 
non compose for six or seven — 

The plastic bulb shattered in 
Powell's fingers. A vivid blue 
light flared under Crabbe's nose. 
Caught in mid-oration, the Commissioner dropped to the floor. 

"Good Heavens!" Powell exclaimed. He looked at Kri^t severely. "You made the covering 
too thin, Kr^t. Now see what 
you've done to Commissioner 
Crabbe." 

"What I've done?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



I IT 



"Feed that data to Peetcy" 
the D.A. said in a voice rigid 
with control. "This he'll buy." 

They made the Commissioner 
comfortable. "Now the murder 
method " Powell repeated. 
"Kindly watch this, gentlemen. 
The hand is quicker than the 
eye." He exhibited a revolver 
from the police museum. From 
the chambers he removed the 
shells, and from one of the shells 
he extracted the bullet. "This is 
what Reich did to the gun Jerry 
Church gave him before the murder — pretended to make it safe. 
A phony alibi." 

"Phony, hell! That gun is safe. 
Is that Church's evidence?" 

"It is. Look at your sheet." 

"Then you don't have to bother 
Peetcy with the problem." The 
D.A. threw his papers down in 
disgust. "How can a cartridge kill 
without a bullet? Your sheet 
doesn't say Reich reloaded." 

"He reloaded." 

"He did not," Kri^t insisted. 
"There was no projectile in the 
wound or the room." 

"Why, you located it yourself, 
Krl^t. That bit of candy gel in 
D'Courtney's mouth. Remember? 
And no candy in the stomach." 

Krl/£t glared, Powell grinned. 
He took an eyedropper and filled 
a. gel capsule with water, pressed 
it into the open end of the cartridge above the charge and 
placed the cartridge in the gun. 
He raised the gun, aimed at a 

111 



small wooden block on the edge 
of the model table, and pulled the 
trigger. There was a dull, flat explosion and the block leaped into 
fragments. 

"That was a trick!" The D.A. 
exclaimed. "There was something 
in that shell besides water." 

"With a powder charge, you 
can shoot an ounce of water with 
enough muzzle velocity to blow 
out the back of a head if you fire 
through the victim's palate. 
That's why Reich had to shoot 
through the mouth. That's w,hy 
Kri/^t found that bit of gel and 
nothing else. The projectile, of 
course, was gone." 

"Give it to Peetcy," the D.A. 
said faintly. "By God, Powell, 
I'm beginning to think we've got 
a case." 

"All right. Now, motive. We 
picked up Reich's business records; Accounting's gone through 
them. D'Courtney had Reich with 
his back to the wall. Reich tried 
to join D'Courtney. He failed. He 
murdered D'Courtney. Will you 
buy that?" 

"Sure I'll buy it, but will 
Peetcy? Feed it in and let's see." 

They fed in the last of the 
punched data, shifted Peetcy up 
from "Idle" to "Run." Peetcy's 
eyes blinked in hard meditation; 
his stomach rumbled softly; his 
memory stuttered. Powell and the 
others waited with mounting suspense. A soft bell began to ping 
and Peetcy's type hammered.' 




"IF IT please the court, with

URp." 

"What the hell?" Powell looked 
at $$on. 

"He gets kittenish now and 
then," $$on explained. 

They held the warm-up for a 
good five minutes and then kicked 
him into it. Once more his eyes 
blinked, his stomach growled, his 
memory hissed, and Powell and 
the. two staffs waited anxiously. 
A month's hard work hung on 
this decision. The type-hammers 
began to fall.

"Passion motive?" Powell muttered. "Is Peetcy crazy? It's a 
profit motive. Check C-l, $$>on." 

$$on checked. "No mistake 
here." 

"Try him again." 

They ran Peetcy through it a 
third time. This time he spoke

"Excuse me," Powell said to the 
others, "I've got to peep this out 
with $$on." He turned to $$on: 
"Open up, Charley. I smelled an 
evasion in them last words." 

"Honestly, Pres, I'm not aware 
of any — " 

"// you were aware, it wouldn't 
be an evasion. It'd be a downright 
lie. Now lemme see . . . Oh. Of 
course?" Powell spoke aloud to 
the staff: "$$on's missing one 
small point. Code is still working 
with Hassop upstairs. We've got 
the knowledge that Reich offered 
merger and was refused. But we 
haven't decoded the definite offer 
and refusal yet. That's what 
Peetcy wants." 

"How do you know the offer 
was made and refused?" the D. A. 
«sked, 

"Got that from Reich himself 
through Gus T8. It was one of the 
last things T8 gave me before he 
was murdered. I tell you what, 
$$on — add an assumption to the 
tape. Assuming that our merger 
evidence is unassailable, which it 
is, what does Peetcy think of the 
case?" 

$$on hand punched s strip, 
spliced it to the main problem 
and fed it in again. By now well 
warmed up, Peetcy answered in 
thirty seconds: "brief #921,088. 

ACCEPTING ASSUMPTION, PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION 

97.0099%." 

Powell's staff grinned and relaxed. Powell tore the tape out 



and presented it to the D.A. with 
a flourish. 

"By God I" the D.A. said. 
"Ninety-seven per cent! I thought 
I was lucky when I broke seventy If 

The office door opened and 
two perspiring men came in. 

"Here's Code now," Powell 
said. "You bust it?" 

"We busted it," one said, "and 
now you're busted, Powell. The 
whole case is busted." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Reich knocked off D'Courtney 
because D'Courtney ' wouldn't 
merge? He had a nice fat profit 
motive for killing D'Courtney? 
In a pig's eye he did." 

"Reich sent yyji tted rrcb 
uufe aalk qqba to D'Courtney," 
the other added. "That reads: 

SUGGEST MERGER BOTH OUR INTERESTS EQUAL PARTNERSHIP." 

"Damn it, that's what I've said 
all along. And D'Courtney replied: WWHG. That was a refusal. Reich told T8. T8 told me." 

"D'Courtney answered wwhg. 
That reads: accept offer." 

"The hell it does!" 

"The hell it doesn't. You'll 
never convince any court in the 
Solar System that Reich had a 
motive for murdering D'Courtney. Your case is washed out." 

Powell stood still, his fists 
clenched. Suddenly he pulled out 
the android figure of Reich and 
twisted its head off. He went to 
Peetcy, yanked out the tapes of 



• Al^.XX fC.INCE FICIION 



punched data, crumpled tfcem 
into a wad and hurled the wad 
across the room. He launched a 
tremendous kick at the chair 
Crabbe sat slumped in. While 
the staffs watched in appalled silence, the chair and Commissioner 
overturned to the floor. 

"Damn you, you're always sitting in that chair!" Powell -said 
and stormed out of the office.

~T\EMOLITION! Concussion! 

Explosion! The cell doors 
burst open, The stellite sparks 
sizzle in showers of daggers and 
bullets. And far outside, freedom 
is waiting in the cloak of darkness 
and flight into the unknown . . . 

Who's outside the cell-block? 
The Man With No Face! Looking. Looming. Silent. 

Fly through space! There's 
time and safety in the solitude 
of this velvet-lined launch. The 
hatch door! Opening. But it 
can't. I'm alone. The Man With 
No Face! Looking. Looming. Silent. 

But I am innocent, your honor. 
You will never prove my guilt. 
On the bench. The Man With No 
Face. 

Looking. Looming. 1 Pounding 
his gavel. 

The pounding turned to 
knocking on the stateroom door. 
"Over New York, Mr. Reich. One 
hour to debarkation.*' 



"All right," Reich croaked. "I 
hear you." 

Climbing out of bed, still in 
the grip of the nightmare's terror, 
he lurched around the stateroom. 
He hurled his linen and clothes 
into the Disposary, selected fresh 
clothes from the Dispenser and 
laid them out. 

He went into the bathroom, 
depilated, showered, steamed and 
air-washed for ten minutes. He 
was still reeling. He stepped into 
the massage alcove and punched 
"Glow Salt." There was a dull 
concussion and Reich was hurled 
to the floor, his back slashed by 
flying particles, 

Reacting instinctively, he 
darted into the bedroom, seized 
his traveling case, groped for the 
cartridge of detonation bulbs he 
always carried. There were none 
in the case. 

Reich pulled himself together. 
Aware of the bite of salt in the 
cuts in his back, he went back 
into the bathroom, shut off the 
massage buffers and inspected the 
alcove wreckage. Someone had 
removed the cartridge from his 
case during the night and planted 
a bulb in each of the massage 
buffers. The empty cartridge lay 
behind the alcove. 

He inspected his stateroom 
door. The lock had evidently 
been gaffed by a master. But 
who? Why? 

He returned deliberately to the 
bathroom, washed off the salt

and blood, and sprayed his back 
with coagulent. He dressed, had 
his coffee and descended to the 
Staging Hall where, after a savage skirmish with the peeper Customs Man (Tension, apprehension and dissension have began]), 
he boarded the Sacrament launch 
that was waiting to take him 
downjto the city. 

From the launch he called Sacrament. His secretary's face appeared on the screen. 

"Any news of Hassop?" Reich 
asked. 

"No f Mr. Reich. Not since you 
called from Ampro." 

"Give me Relations." 

The screen disclosed the chrome 
lounge of Sacrament. West, carefully binding sheets of typescript 
into plastic volumes, looked up 
and grinned. 

"Hi, Ben." 

"Don't look so cheerful, Ellery," Reich growled. "Where the 
hell is Hassop? I thought you'd 
surely — " 

West displayed the volumes. 
"History of my career with Sacrament for your files. Said career 
ended this morning at nine." 

"What?" 

"The Guild's just ruled Sacrament out of bounds. Company 
espionage is unethical." 

"Ellery, you can't quit now. 
Someone tried to boobytrap me 
on the ship this morning. I've 
got to find out who it is. I need 
a peeper." 



"Sorry, Ben." 

"You don't have to work for 
Sacrament. 1*11 put you under 
personal contract for private service. The same contract Breen 
has." 

"Breen? The analyst? Not any 
more." 

"No — more?" 

"The ruling came down today. 
Exclusive practice barred. It 
limits the service of peepers. 
We've got to be dedicated to the 
most good for the most people." 

"It's that bastard, Powell !" 
Reich shouted. "Using every 
lousy peeper trick he can dig out 
of the slime to bitch me!" 

"Sign off, Ben. Powell had nothing to do with it. It was T'sungHsai, our president. Old T-H 
finally got around to commercial 
jurisdiction and handed down a 
raft of rulings this morning. You 
got bracketed between a couple of 
them, that's all." 

"You smug peepers talk so 
much about ethics, but you fight 
as dirty as — " 

"Ben ! Whafs the use of 
screaming? We've always made 
it pleasant. Let's break it pleasant." 

"Go to hell !" Reich roared and 
cut the connection. To the launch 
pilot he said in the same tone: 
"Take me home!" 

REICH burst into his tower 
apartment, once again awakening the hearts of his staff to 



122 



• ALA Xy SCI I NCI M^TIjON 



terror and hatred. He hurled his 
traveling case at the horse-faced 
valet and went immediately to 
Breen's suite. 
It was empty. 

Reich strode to his own rooms 
and went to the phone. He dialed 
Gus T8. The screen cleared: 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTINUED 
Reich stared, broke the connection and dialed Jeremy Church. 
The screen cleared : 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTINUED 

He swore and tried Keno 
Q uizzard's gambling house. 
Again: 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTUVUED 

Reich paced around the study 
uncertainly, then went to the 
shimmer of light in the corner 
that was his safe, wondering if 
old Geoffrey Reich had anything 
to contribute. He switched the 
safe into temporal phase, revealing the honeycomb paper rack, 
and reached for the small red envelope. As he touched it, he heard 
the faint click. He doubled up 
and spun away, his face buried 
in his arms. 

Something brutal punched 
Reich in the side and slammed 
him against the wall. He heard 
his staff come running down the 
corridor and roared: "Keep out! 
All of you!" 

He stumbled through' the 
wreckage and began sorting over 



the remains of his safe. He found 
the TP scrambler he had taken 
from Chooka Flood's red-eyed 
woman. He found the malignant 
steel flower that was the knifepistol that had killed D' Courtney. It still contained four unfired shells loaded with water 
and sealed with gel. He thrust 
both into his pocket, got a fresh 
cartridge of detonation bulbs from 
his desk, and tore out of the 
room, ignoring the servants who 
stared at him in astonishment. 

Reich swore feverishly from the 
tower apartment to the cellar garage where he deposited his 
Jumper key in the call slot and 
waited for the little car. When 
it came out of storage with the 
key in the door, Reich turned t^e 
key and yanked open the door to 
jump in. There was a low pressure rip. R?ich hurled himself to 
the ground. The Jumper tank 
exploded, erupting a shattering 
geyser of fuel and fragments of 
metal. Reich crawled frantically, 
reached the exit ramp and ran. 

On the street level, bleeding, 
rank with creosote fuel, he flagged 
a Jumper. 

"Where to?" the driver as'r-d. 

He tried to think co'ierendy. 
"Chooka Frood's. Down in Bastion West." 

"They'll never let you in looking like that." 

"Chooka Frood!" Reich repeated. 

The cab hopped him there. He 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 123 



thrust past the protesting doorman and the indignant reception 
clerk to the private office. Chooka 
was seated at the desk, wearing 
a dingy smock and a dingy expression that changed to alarm 
when Reich yanked the scrambler 
out of his pocket. 

"Here I am, Chooka," he said 
hoarsely. "I used this scrambler 
on you once before. I'm warmed 
up for it again." 

She screamed: "Magda!" 

Reich caught her by the arm 
end hurled her across the office. 
The red-eyed woman came running into the office. Reich was 
ready for her. He clubbed her 
s cross the b ack of the neck . 

Ignoring her, he spat at 
Chooka; "Let's get it squared off. 
Why the boobytraps?" 

Chfcoka shook her head daz«dly. 

"Three of them so far. On the 
»hip coming back from Ampro. 
In my study. In my Jumper, How 
many more, Chooka?" 

"It wasn't me, Reich. So help 
me!" 

"My stateroom lock was gaffed. 
My safe lock was gaffed. My 
Jumper lock was gaffed. That 
taVes a professional heavy gimptter. It adds up to you, so let's 
get it squared off." He slammed 
the safety off the scrambler. "I've 
got a man named Powell to 
swindle. I've got a cartel named 
D'Courtney to swindle. I've got 
no time to waste on you." 



"For God's sake!" Chooka 
screamed. "What have 1 got 
against you? So you roughhoused a little. So you mugged 
Magda. So you strong-armed the 
D'Courtney girl out of me. Would 
I be shoving you into the Serpent 
because you held a scrambler on 
me? Use your head!" 

"I used it. If it isn't you, who , 
else?" 

"Keno Quizzard. He hires 
gimpsters too. I heard you and 
him — " 

"Quizzard's dead. Who else?" 
"Church." 

"He hasn't got the guts or he 
would have tried it ten years ago. 
Now he's waiting for favors. Who 
else?" 

"How do I know? There's hundreds hate you enough." 

"Thousands, but who could get 
into my safe? Who could break 
a phase combination and — " 

"Maybe nobody broke into 
your safe. Maybe somebody broke 
into your head and peeped the 
combination." 

"Peeped!" 

"Yeah, peeped. Maybe you 
added Church up wrong, or some 
other peeper that's got a reason 
to fill your coffin." 

"Yes," Reich whispered. 

"Church?" 

"Powell! He can't get a case 
together. I stopped him with 
Duffy Wyg&'s song. I stopped 
him with the Sardine game. He 
can't get at % ma m e and the

Rhodopsin. He can't get the gun. 
He got the D'Courtney girl, but 
•he's probably in Kingston Hospital right now. Hassop's dead in 
that stampede or missing. He's 
got nothing but boobytrapping 
left,. . ." 

"You're crazy, Reich." 

"Am I? Why did he take EIlcry West and Breen away from 
me? He knows the only defense 
I've got against a boobytxap is 
a peeper." 

"But a cop, Reich?" 

"Why not a cop? Who'd suspect him? It's what I'd do myself. 
All right, now I'm going to boobytrap him!" He went to Chooka 
and yanked her to her feet. "Call 
Powell. Tell him to come down 
here right away." 

"No, Reich 

"Listen to me, frab-head. Bastion West is owned by the 
D'Courtney cartel. Now that old 
D'Courtney's dead, I own the 
cartel. I own you, Chooka. You 
want to stay in business? Call 
Powell!" 

"He's a peeper. When he comes 
down, he'll know I'm lying." 

"Wait a minute." Reich 
thought, then yanked the knifepistol from his pocket and shoved 
it into Chooka's hands. "Tell him 
the D'Courtney girl left this here. 
It's the gun D'Courtney rode onto 
the Serpent." 

"And you're giving it to him?" 

Reich laughed. "By the time 
he's got it, he'll be booby trapped/* 



He thrust Chooka toward the 
phone, followed her and stood 
alongside the screen out of the 
line of sight. He hefted the scrambler in his hand meaningfully. 

She dialed Powell's number. 
Mary Noyes appeared on the 
screen, listened to Chooka, then 
called Powell. The Prefect appeared, his lean face haggard, 
his dark eyes heavily shadowed. 

"I . . . I got something you 
might want, Mr. Powell," Chooka 
stammered. "I just found it. That 
girl you took outa my house left 
it behind. The gun that sent her 
father onto the Serpent. See?" 

"That's it, by heaven!" Powell 
exclaimed. "I'll be down as fast 
as a Jumper can jet." 

The screen blacked out. Reich 
dashed out of the Rainbow House 
and ran through the alleys of Bastion West until he located a public 
Jumper. He dropped a coin into 
the lock, opened the door and 
lurched in. 

"Don't try to think" he 
thought. "Don' t try to plan. 
Leave it to your instincts. Just 
wait and kill!" 

Reich fought himself and the 
controls all the three miles to 
Hudson Ramp. The killer instinct prompted him to crashland in Powell's back garden. He 
didn't know why. As he pounded 
the twisted cabin door open, a 
canned voice spoke: "Your attention, please. You are liable for 
the damage to this vehicle. Leave 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



your name and address. If we 
are forced to trace you, you will 
be liable for the costs. Thank 
you." 

"I'm going to be liable for a 
lot more," Reich growled. "You're 
welcome." 

He plunged under a heavy 
clump of forsythia and waited 
with the scrambler ready. Then 
he understood why he had 
crashed. The girl who had answered Powell's phone ran 
through the garden toward the 
jumper. Reich waited. No one 
else came from the house. The 
girl spun around before she heard 
him. A peeper. He pulled the trigger to first notch. She stiffened, 
helpless. 

He was about to pull the trigger a^ the way back to the big 
D, but instinct stopped him again. 
Kill the girl in the house. Seed 
he:T body with detonation bulbs 
and leave that bait for Powell. 
Reich forced a handkerchief into 
her mouth, took her by the arm. 

Inside the house, Reich found 
a long, corded modern lounge in 
the living room and thrust the 
girl down on it. She was fighting 
him with everything but her paralyzed body. He grinned savagely, 
bent down and kissed her full on 
the mouth. 

"My love to Powell," he said, 
raising the scrambler. 

Someone was watching him. 

He darted a quick look around 
the living room. There was no 



one. He turned back to the girl. 
"You doing that with TP, peeper?" Then he raised the scrambler. 
Again he lowered it. 

Someone was watching him. 

This time, Reich prowled 
around the living room, searching 
behind chairs, inside • closets, 
checked the kitchen and the bath. 
No one. He returned to the living room and Mary Noyes, then 
thought of the upper floor. He 
went to the stairs, started to 
mount them, and stopped in midstride. 

Someone was watching him. 

She was at the head of the 
stairs, kneeling and peeping 
through the banisters. She was 
dressed like a child "in tight little 
leotards with her hair drawn back 
and tied with ribbon. Barbara 
D' Courtney. 

"I'm Baba," she said. 

Reich, shaking, motioned to 
her faintly. She came down the 
stairs, holding on to the banister 
carefully. 

"I'm not s'posed to," she said. 
"Are you Papa's friend?" 

Reich took a breath. "I . . . " 

"Papa had to go away," she 
prattled. "But he's coming back 
right away. If I'm a good girl, 
he'll bring me a present. I'm trying, but it's awful hard. Are you 
good?" 

"Coming b-back? Your father?" 

She noddedL "You kissed Aunt 
Mary. I saw it- Papa kisses me. 
I like it. Does Aunt Mary like

it?" She took his hand confidently. "When I grow up. I'm 
going to marry Papa. Do you 
have a girl?" 

Reich pulled Barbara around 
and stared into her face. "Do you 
think I'll fall into that orbit? 
How much did you tell Powell?" 

"That's my papa," she said. 
"When I ask him why his name 
is different from my name, he 
looks funny. What's your name?" 

"Who do you think you're fooling with that act? Answer me!— 
How much did you tell him?" 

She began to cry, trying to pull 
away from him. "Let me go!" 

He dragged her to the lounge 
where Mary Noyes still sat paralysed. He threw the girl down 
beside her and stepped back 
again, with the scrambler raised. 
Suddenly, the girl whipped upright in the chair in a listening 
attitude. Her face lost its childishness and became drawn and 
taut. She leaped from the lounge, 
ran, stopped abruptly, then appeared to open a door. She ran 
forward, yellow hair flying, dark 
eyes wide with alarm ... a lightning flash of wild beauty. 

"Father!" she screamed. "For 
God's sake! Father!" 

Reich's heart constricted. The 
girl ran toward him. He stepped 
forward to catch her. She darted 
to the left. 

"No!" she cried. "No! Father!" 

Reich caught her while she 
fought and screamed. The girl 



suddenly stiffened and clutched 
her ears. Reich was in the Orchid 
Suite. He heard the explosion 
and saw the blood and brains 
gout out of the back of D'Courtney's head. She fell to her knees 
and crawled across the floor. He 
saw her crouch over the waxen 
body. 

Reich gasped for breath and 
beat his knuckles together painfully, fighting for control. He had 
never counted on a witness. Damn 
Gus T8 ! Wait. He wasn't in 
Beaumont House. He was in ... , 

"Thirty -three Hudson Ramp," 
Powell informed him from the 
front door. 

Reich jerked around, whipped 
the scrambler up. 

"Don't try it," Powell warned 
sharply. 

"You son of a bitch!" Reich 
shouted. "You God damned 
peeper !" 

Powell faked to the left, reversed, delivered a six inch jab 
to the Ulnar synapse. The scrambler fell to the floor. Reich 
clinched, punching, clawing, butting. Powell hit him with three 
lightning blows — nape, navel and 
groin. The effect was that of a 
full spinal block. Reich crashed 
to the floor, retching, blood 
streaming from his nose. 

"You only think you know how 
to gut-fight," Powell grunted. He 
went to Barbara D'Courtney, who 
still knelt on the floor, and raised 
her. "All right, Barbara?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



\17 I 



"Hello, Papa. I had a bad 

dream." 

"I had to give it to you. It 
was an experiment on that big 
oaf." 

"Gimme a kiss." 

He kissed her forehead. "You're 
growing up fast," he smiled. "You 
were just baby-talking yesterday." 

"I'm growing up because you 
promised to wait for me." 

"It's a promise, Barbara. Can 
you go upstairs to your room by 
yourself or do you have to be 
carried . . . like yesterday?" 

"I can go all by my own self." 

She took a firm hold on the 
banister and climbed up. Just 
before she reached the top, she 
stuck her tongue out at Reich, 
thenVdisappeared. Powell crossed 
to Mary Noyes, removed the gag, 
checked her pulse. 

"First notch, eh?" he said to 
Retch. "Painful, but she'll recover in an hour. I ought to pay 
you back for this, but what's the 
use? It wouldn't teach you anything. You're just no damned 
good." 

"Kill me!" Reich groaned, 
writhing. "Kill me or let me up 
and, by Christ, I'll kill you!" 
( Powell picked up the scrambler. "Try flexing your muscles 
a little. Those blocks shouldn't 
last more than a few seconds ..." 
He sat down with the scrambler 
in his lap. "You had a tough 
break. I wasn't out of the house 



five minutes when I realized 
Chooka's story was a phony. You 
put her up to it, of course." 

"You're the aphony!" Reich 
shouted. "You and your ethicsl" 

"She said the gun sent 
D' Courtney on the Serpent," 
Powell continued imperturbably. 
"It did, but she couldn't know 
what killed D'Courtney. I turned 
around and came back, of course." 

Reich struggled up, his breath 
hissing horribly. Suddenly he 
dipped into his pocket and 
brought out the cartridge of detonation bulbs. Powell arched 
back in the chair and kicked 
Reich in the chest. The cartridges 
went flying. Reich collapsed on 
a sofa. 

"When will you learn you can't 
surprise a peeper?" Powell said. 
He went to the cartridge and 
picked it up. "Quite the arsenal 
today, aren't you? You're acting 
more like a wanted 1 man than like 
a free man. Notice I said free, 
not innocent." 

"Free how long?" Reich said 
through his teeth.»"I never talked 
about innocence either. But free 
how long?" 

*'l had a perfect case against 
you. Every detail right. I checked 
that when I peeped you with 
Barbara just now. That one flaw 
blew my case out into deep space. 
You're a free man, Reich. We've 
closed your file." 

Reich stared. "Closed the file?" 
"You can disarm, Reich. No

one's going to bother you. n 

"This is one of your peeper 
tricks!" 

"I'll lay it out for you. I know 
all about you . , . how much you 
bribed Gus T8 . . . what you 
promised Jerry Church . . . where 
you located that Sardine Game 
. . . what you did with Wilson 
54maine's Rhodopsin Caps . . . 
how you emptied those cartridges 
for an alibi and then turned them 
lethal again with water. So far 
a perfect chain of evidence. 
Method and opportunity. But 
motive was the flaw. The courts 
demand objective motive and I 
can't produce it. That sets you 
free." 

"You liar!" 

"I could throw breaking and 
entering with deadly intent at 
you, but it's too small a charge. 
You could probably beat it, too. 
My only witnesses would be a 
peeper and a sick girl." 

"Am I supposed to believe you? 
You had nothing, Powell. I 
licked you on every point. That's 
why you're boobytrapping me." 
Reich broke off abruptly. "This 
is probably the biggest boobytrap 
of all. And I fell into it. What a 
damned fool I am!" 

"Shut up," Powell snapped. 
"When you rave like that, I 
can't peep you!" 

Powell focused on Reich. Then 
his face began to pale. 

"That's it! Mr. Peetcy was 
right. Passion motive, and we 



thought he was kittenish. Barbara's Siamese twin image . . , 
D'Courtney's guilt. No wonder 
Reich couldn't kill us at Chooka's 
. . . But the murder isn't important any more. It goes deeper. 
And it's more dangerous than I 
ever dreamed." 

He stopped, turned and looked 
at Reich with blazing eyes. "Do 
you know how dangerous you 
are? Does a plague know its peril? 
Is death aware that it is death?" 

Reich goggled at Powell in bewilderment. 

"Why ask you?" Powell muttered. "You don't know what 
I'm talking about. You'll never 
know." 

He went to a sideboard, selected two brandy ampules and 
popped them into Reich's mouth. 
Reich choked on the brandy and 
sputtered angrily. 

"Get this straight," Powell 
said. "The case against you is 
closed because of those boobytraps. If I'd known about them, 
I'd have broken my conditioning 
and killed you." 

Reich stopped sputtering. 

"When you offered merger to 
D'Courtney, he sent wwhg in 
answer, which is acceptance. You 
had no reason to murder him. 
That was the flaw in the case." 

Reich went white, "wwhg — 
offer refused!" 

"He accepted. When I learned 
that I knew I couldn't bring the 
case to court. But I'm not the

man who's trying to murder you. 
That man is trying to kill you 
because he knows you're safe 
from Demolition. He's always 
known /what I've just discovered 
— that you're a ghastly menace to 
our entire future." 

Reich struggled up out of the 
sofa. ''Who is it? Who?" 

"Your ancient enemy, Reich. 
You'll never be able to run from 
him . . . hide from him . . . and 
I hope you'll never be able to 
save yourself from him." 

"WHO IS IT?" 

"The Man With No Face." 

Reich turned and staggered out 
of the house. 

XVI 

"YOU'VE got to think. What's 
■J- ^happened to you? Why 
don't you think?" 

Tension, apprehension and — 
"He was lying. A giant boobytrap, wwhg — refusal. But why 
did he lie? How is that going to 
help him?" 

— dissension have begun. 
"The Man With No Face. 
Breen could have told Powell. So 
could Gus T8. Think!" 
Tension— 

"There is no Man With No 
Face. It's just a nightmare!" 
Apprehension — 

"What about the boobytraps, 
though? He had me cold in his 
house. Why didn't he pull the 
switch? Telling me I'm free. 



What's he up to? Think!" 

Dissension — 
"He's your enemy. You'll never 
be able to run from him . . . hide 
from him . . . save yourself from 
him! Not the Man With No Face. 
It's Powell!" 

A hand touched his shoulder. 
"Mr. Reich?" 

Reich became aware that it 
was raining heavily. He was lying 
on his side, knees drawn up, 
drenched, shivering with cold. 
He was in the esplanade of 
Bomb Inlet. Around him were 
sighing, sodden trees. A figure 
was bending over him. 

"Who are you?" 

"Galen Chervil. From Maria 
Beaumont's party. Can I do you 
that favor, Mr. Reich?" 

"Don't peep me!" Reich cried. 

"I'm not, Mr. Reich. We don't 
usually — Young Chervil caught 
himself. "I didn't know you knew 
I was a peeper." 

"I know all you lousy — " 

"Don't say it, Mr. Reich. You'll 
make it too easy for me to agree 
with you." 

Young Chervil took him under 
the shoulders and raised him, 
staring at Reich's frightful appearance. 

"Were you mugged, Mr. 
Reich?" 

"What? No." 

"Accident, sir?" 

"No, I . . . Oh, get the hell 
away from me!" 

"Certainly, sir. I thought you 



1M 




 



needed help and I owe you a 
favor, but — " 

"Come back." Reich grasped 
the bole of a tree, thrust himself 
erect and glared at Chervil with 
bloodshot eyes. "You mean that 
about the favor?" 

"Of course, Mr. Reich." 

"My problem's murder, Chervil. I want to find out who's frying to kill me. Will you do me 
that favor? Will you peep someone for me?" 

"I should imagine the police 
would be able to — " 

"The police?" Reich laughed, 
then clutched himself in agony. 
"I want you to peep a top cop for 
me, Chervil. The Commissioner 
himself." He let go the tree and 
lurched to Chervil. "I want to 
visit my friend the Commissioner 
and ask him a few questions. I 
want you to be there to tell me 
the truth." 

"But the Commissioner might 
not care to be peeped, sir."" 

"He won't know he's peeped," 
Reich roared. "Look at me, you 
fool. I'm cut . . . I'm broken . . . 
I'm half out of my mind . . . I'm 
two-thirds murdered! I need that 
favor. You say you owe it. Will 
you come to Crabbe's office and 
peep him for me?" 

"Yes, Mr. Reich." 

"An honest peeper! How about 
that? Let's jet." 

"'Reich rah out of the esplanade 
like a freshly decapitated man.

the fury that drove Reich through 
injury, through fever, through 
agony to police headquarters. 
Ttfere, Reich bulled and roared 
past clerks and guards into Commissioner Cr abbe's elaborate 
ebony -and -silver office. 

"My God, Reich!" Crabbe was 
aghast. "It is you. isn't it?" 

"Sit down, Chervil," Reich said. 
He turned to Crabbe. "It's me. 
I was almost murdered three 
times today. This boy . . . M Reich 
pointed to Chervil. "This boy 
just found me in the Inlet Esplanade more dead than alive. 
And where have the damned police been?" 

*'Murdered!" Crabbe thumped 
his desk emphatically. "Of 
course! Powell is a fool. I should 
never have let Sherman MacGranger go." 

"Sherman MacWho?" 

"MacGranger. The man who 
murdered D'Courtney. He signed 
a confession . . . and that idiot 
Powell made me free him!" 

"MacGranger murdered 
D'Courtney?" 

"He did, Ben, and he's probably after you. I told Powell you 
were innocent. He wouldn't listen 
to me. I showed him MacGranger. 
He wouldn't listen to him. Even 
when Mr. Peetcy told him you 
were innocent, he wouldn't listen." 

"The machine said I was innocent?" 

"Of course 1 it did. There's no 

iff 



case against you. But there's ■ a 

case against MacGranger, and 
I'm going to convict him before 
he murders you, too." Crabbe 
strode to the door. "I'm sending 
out a call for him right now. 
Don't go, Ben, I want to talk to 
you about that Solar Senatorship . . . " 

. The door opened and slammed. 
Reich reeled and fought his way 
back to the world. He looked at 
three Chervils. "Well?" 

"He's telling the truth, Mr. 
Reich." 

"About me? About Powell? 
About MacGranger?" 

"He's telling the truth about 
you," Chervil said. "The Prosecution Transistor Computor has 
declined to authorize any action 
agajjjst you for the D'Courtney 
murder. Mr. Powell has been 
forced to abandon the case and 
. . ... well, his career is in jeopardy.** 

"Is that true?" Reich seized his 
shoulders. "Is it?** 

"Yes, Mr. Reich. The Commissioner believes he's telling the 
truth about Sherman MacGrangger, but his recollection shows 
that MacGranger could not be 
the murd — M 

"To hell with MacGranger! 
I've been cleared?** 

"You have been, Mr. Reich, No 
one's going to bother you."* 

Reich burst into a roar of triumphant laughter, brushed past 
Chervil and left the Commissioner's office, a Neanderthal ves


tige parading down headquarters* 
corridors,, streaked with blood 
and mud, laughing and groaning 
because of the pain of laughing, 
bearing himself with limping arrogance. 

He stood for a moment on the 
steps, gazing at the rainswept 
streets ... at the amusement 
center across the square, block 
after block blazing under a single 
transparent dome ... at the 
open shops lining the upper footways, all bustle and brilliance as 
the city's night shopping began 
. . . the towering office buildings 
in the background, great twohundred-story cubes and the lace 
tracery of skyways linking them 
together . . . the twinkling running lights of Jumpers. 

"I'll own you!" he promised, 
his laugh rising hysterically. 
"Live, die, laugh, cry, love, beget 
— I'll .own you all!" 

Then his eyes caught the tall, 
ominous familiar figure crossing 
the square, watching him covertly 
over its shoulder. A figure of black 
shadows sparkling with raindrop 
jewels . . . looking, looming, silent, horrible ... 

A Man With No Face. 

Like a blighted tree, Reich fell 
in a crooked arc to the ground. 

AT one minute to nine, ten of 
the fifteen members of the 
Esper Guild Council assembled 
in President T'sung Hsai's office. 
The minutes read as follows:

GALAXY SCIENCE FiCTIQN 



EMERGENCY BUSINESS 

Request for Mass Cathexis with 
Preston Powell as canal for Capitalized Energy. 
Consternation 

T'sung: Honorable Powell, your 
request bewilders this threadbare brain. What can possibly 
require such an extraordinary 
end dangerous measure? 

Powell: Reich is about to become 
a Galactic Focal Point ... A 
crucial link between the Positive Past and the Probable Future. He is on the verge of a 
powerful reorganization at this 
moment. If Reich can adjust 
before I reach him, he will become immune to our reality, 
invulnerable to our attack — 
the deadly enemy of our Guild 
and Galactic Reason and Reality. 

Alarm 

@kins: Surely you're exaggerating, Powell? 

Powell: Inspect the picture with 
me. Look at this perspective of 
Reich's position in time and 
space. Will not his beliefs become the world's belief? Will 
not his reality become the 
world's reality? Is he not, in 
his critical position of power, 
energy and intellect, a sure 
road to utter destruction? 

Conviction 

T'sung: It is the truth. Nevertheless, this unworthy person 
is most reluctant to authorize 
Mass Cathexis. It has invari


ably destroyed the Energy Canal in past attempts. You are 
too valuable to be destroyed, 
Powell. 

Powell: I must be permitted to 
run the risk. Reich is one of 
the rare Universe Shakers . . ; 
a child as yet, but about to 
mature. And all reality . . . 
Espers, Normals, Life, the 
Earth, the moons, the Solar 
System, the galaxies, the Universe itself ... all reality hangs 
precariously on his awakening. 
He cannot be permitted to 
awaken to the wrong reality. 
I call the question. 

Jordan; You're asking us to vote 
your death. 

Powell : My probable death 
against the certain death of 
everything. I call the question. 

T'sung: It is a two-tongued question. You have no guarantee 
that the measure will be successful. 

(g'kins: Let Reich awaken as he 
will. We have the time and the 
warning to attack him on another crossroad. 
Powell: I call the question! 
Decision: Request granted.

hour later. He bad made his 
will, paid his bills, arranged everything. There had been dismay

at the Guild. There was dismay 
when he came home, for Mary 
Noyes got the picture the instant 
he entered. 

"No fuss. It's got to be done." 

"But—" 

"There s a chance it won't kill 
me. Oh, one thing. Lab wants a 
brain autopsy it I die. They'd 
tike to have the body before rigor. 
If they can't get the corpse, they'll 



settle for the head. See to it, 
will you?" 
"Pres.'" 

"Sorry. Now you'd better pack 
and take the baby up to Kingston 
Hospital. She won't be safe here." 

"She isn't a baby any more. 
She — Oh, Pres.'" 

Mary turned and ran upstairs, 
trailing the familiar sensory impact: Snow /mint /tulips/ taffeta, 
now mixed with terror and 
tears. Powell sighed, then smiled 
as a highly poised teen-ager appeared at the head of the stairs. 
She paused halfway down to let 




him take in the dress and the 
manner. 

"Why, ifs Mr. Powell, is it 
not?" 

"It is. Good morning,*Barbara." 

"And what brings you to our 
little domain this morning?" She 
came down the rest of the stairs 
with her fingertips brushing the 
banister, and tripped on the bottom step. "Oh, Pip!" she cursed. 

Powell caught her. "Pop," he 
•aid. 

"Bim." 

"Bam." 

She looked up at him. "You 
stand right here. I'm going to 
come down those stairs again and 
I bet I do it perfect." 

"1*11 bet you' don't." 

She turned, trotted up, posed 
again at the top step and began the grand descent. "I am no 
longer the mere child I was yesterday. I am ages and ages older. 
You must regard me as an adult 
from now on." She negotiated 
the bottom step and regarded him 
intently. "Good?" 

"Splendid, dear." 

Suddenly she laughed, pushed 
him into a chair and plumped 
down on his lap. Powell groaned. 

"Gently, Barbara. You're ages 
older and pounds heavier." 

"Listen," she said, "what ever 
made me think you were my 
father?" 

"What's the matter with me as 
a father?" 

"Do you feel like a father to


ward me? I don't feel like a 

daughter toward you." 
"Oh? How do you feel?" 
"I asked first, so you go first.'* 
"My feelings toward you are 

those of a loving and dutiful 

son." 

She flushed angrily and got up \ 
from his lap. "I wanted you to • 
be serious, because I need advice." 

"I'm sorry, Barbara. What is 
it?" 

She knelt alongside him and 
took his hand. "I'm all mixed up 
about you." 

"Yes. I know." 

"And you're all mixed up about 
me, too." 

"That's true. I am." 
"Is it wrong?" 

Powell heaved up from the 
chair and began pacing unhappily. "No, Barbara, it isn't wrong. 
The two of us are four peopletwo of you, and two of me." 

"Why?" 

"You've been sick, dear, so *.ve 
had to turn you into a baby and 
let you grow up again. That's 
why you're two people. The 
grown-up Barbara inside, the 
baby outside." 

"And you?" 

"I'm two grown-up people. One 
of them is me. The other is a 
member of the governing Council 
of the Esper Guild." 

She considered earnestly. "When 
I don't feel like a daughter to 
you, which me feels like that?"

"You do know. Why won't you

ier arms around his neck, a 
jrown-up woman with the manner of a child. "If I love you — ** 

"At! right" Powell thought 
desperately. "Remember Gaily 
Chervil? It's your turn now. What 
are you going to do? Admit the 
truth?" 

"Yes!" came from the stairs. 
Mary was descending with a traveling case in her hand. "Admit 
the truth." 

"She Isn't a peeper." 

"Forget that. She's a woman 
and she's in love with you. You're 
in love with her. For God's sake, 
give yourselves a chance" 

"A^chance for what? An affair

"She'll be grateful to settle for 
that. Ask me. I know." 

"And If I don't come out alive? 
She'll have nothing but half a 
memory of half a love." 

Powell laughed. "Baby! What 
makes you think I'm in love with 
you that way? I'm not. I've never 
been," 

"You are!" 

"Look at me. Look at Mary.

Barbara stared at Mary, then 
at Powell. She burst into tears 
and sobbed: "Oh, go away! Why 
don't you go away?" 

"Wef're going away, Barbara," 
Mary said. 

She took the girl's arm and led 
her to the door. 

"There's a Jumper waiting,

He stood in the doorway watching the Jumper disappear into 
the steel-blue sky toward Kingston Hospital. He was exhausted, 
a little proud of himself for having made the sacrifice, intensely 
ashamed of himself for feeling 
proud, clearly melancholic. Look 
at that great, foul city of fourteen 
and one half million souls and 
not one soul for him — 

The first impulse came, a thin 
trickle of latent energy. He felt 
it distinctly and glanced at his 
watch. Ten-twenty. So soon? 
He'd better get ready. 

He turned into the house and 
ran up the stairs to his dressing 
room. His psyche began to throb 
and vibrate as he reached out 
for those tiny streams of latent 
energy. He changed his clothes, 
dressed for all weather, and — 

The energy came in torrents

now, a swirling sea of Mass Cathexis directed from each Esper, 
tuned to Powell. 

He was out of the house, wandering through the streets, blind, 
deaf, senseless, immersed in that 
boiling mass of latent energy . , . 
like a ship with sails caught in 
the nexus of a typhoon, fighting 
to convert a whirlpool of wind 
into the motive power that would 
lead to safety. So Powell fought 
to absorb that fearful torrent, to 
Capitalize that latent energy, to 
Cathectize and direct it toward 
the Demolition of Reich before 
it was too late.

"THERE is no what?" Reich 
shouted. He struggled upward, fighting the bedclothes and 
the restraining hands. "There is 
no what?!" 

"No more nightmares," a girl 
said. 

Reich opened his «yes. He was 
in a frilly bed with old-fashioned 
linen and blankets. Duffy Wyg&, 
starched and fresh, tried to thrust 
him back against the pillows. 

"I was awake," he said somberly. "I heard ... I don't know 
what I heard. Infinity and zero. 
Important things. Then I fell 
asleep here." 

"Correction," Duffy smiled. 
"You're awake now." 

"I'm asleep!" Reich shouted. 
"I've got to wake up, Duffy. I've 
got to get back to reality." 

Duffy bent over him and kissed 
him hard on the mouth. "How 
about this? Real?" 

"You don't understand. It's all 
been delusions. I've got to readjust before it's too late." 

Duffy threw up her hands. 
"First that damned doctor scares 
you into a faint. Then he swears 
you're patched up . . . and now 
look at you. Psychotic!" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Who scared me into a faint?'* 

"Rocky ''Martin. A doctor 
friend. In the square in front of 
police headquarters." 

"And you brought me here?** 

"Sure. It's the only way I 
could get you into my bed." 

Reich burst into laughter. 
"'Didn't you once ask to be 
dragged through the gutter, 
Duffy?" 

"I thought I could meet a better class of people." 

"You name the gutter .and you 
can have it. You want a gutter 
from here to Mars? You'll have 
it ! You want me to turn the 
System into a gutter? I'll do it!" 

"Dear man. So modest and so 
faung-over." 

"Drunk? Sure, I'm drunk." 
Reich fcirust his legs out of the 
bed and stood up, reeling slightly. 
He put his arm around her waist 
for support. "Why shouldn't I 
be drunk? I've licked D'Courtney. 
I've licked Powell. I've got sixty 
years of owning every damned 
world ahead of me. How'd you 
like to start a dynasty with me, 
Duffy?" 

"I wouldn't know how to go 
about starting dynasties." 

"You start with Ben Reich. 
First you marry him. Then — " 

"That's enough. When do I 
ctart?" 

"Then you have children and 
you watch Ben Reich take over 
D'Courtney and merge it with 
Sacrament. You watch the ene


mies go down . . . like this!" 
Reich kicked the leg of a busty 
vanity table. It crashed. "Case 
and Umbrel on Venus. Eaten!" 
Reich brought his fists down on 
a torso-shaped side table and 
smashed it. "United Transaction 
on Mars. Mashed and eaten!" He 
crushed a delicate chair. "The 
GCI Combine on Ganymede, Callisto and lo . . . Titan Chemical 
& Atomics . . . And then the 
smaller lice: the Guild of Peepers, the moralists, the patriots 
. . . eaten!" He toppled a marble 
nude from its pedestal. It shattered. 

"Clever up, Mr. Reich!" Duffy 
hung on his neck. "Why waste 
all that violence?" 

He lifted her in his arms and 
shook her until she squealed. 
"Parts of the System will taste 
sweet . . . like you, Duffy. Parts 
will stink to high heaven . . . but 
I'll gobble them alt" He laughed 
end crushed her against him. 
"We'll tear it all down, Duffy, 
and well build it all up to suit 
us. You and me and the dynasty." 

He carried her to the window, 
tore away the drapes. Outside, 
the city was in velvet darkness. 
Only the skyways and streets 
twinkled with lights, and the 
scarlet eyes of an occasional 
Jumper popped up over the jet 
skyline. 

"You out there!" Reich roared. 
"Can you hear me? All of you; 
sleeping and dreammg — you'll* 



• At AH -SCIENCE FICTION 



dream my dreams from now on!" 

He seized the sides of the window and poked his head far out 
into the night, twisting his neck 
to stare up. When he drew his 
head back into the room, his face 
wore a frustrated expression. 

"I want to yell at the stars/* 
he said. "They're not out tonight." 

Duffy looked at him curiously. 
"The what are not out?" 

"The stars. Look up at the sky. 
There's nothing but the Moon." 

"That's the way it always is," 
Duffy said. 

"It is not! Where are the stars?" 

"What stars?" 

"How the hell should I know 
their names? I'm not an astronomer. What's happened to 
the stars?" 

"What are stars?" Duffy asked. 

Reich seized her savagely. 
"Suns boiling and blazing with 
light. Thousands of them shining 
through the night. What the hell's 
the matter with you? Don't you 
understand?" 

Duffy shook her head. Her face 
was terrified. "I don't know what 
you're talking about, Ben." 

He shoved her away, went to 
the bathroom and locked himself 
in. While he was hurriedly bathing and dressing, he heard her 
calling Kingston Hospital on the 
phone; using a guarded voice. 

"Let her start explaining about 
the stars," Reich muttered, halfway betweett anger and terror. He 
caltine out into the bedroom- Duffy 



cut the phone off hastily and 
turned to him. "Wait here for 
me," he growled. "I'm going to 
find out." 

"Find out about what?" 

"About the stars!" he yelled. 

He rushed down to the street. 
On the empty footway, he paused 
and stared up again. There was 
the Moon. There was one brilliant red point of light . . . Mars. 
There was another . . . Jupiter. 
Nothing else. Blackness. It hung 
over his head, enigmatic, terrifying. 

He began to run, still staring 
upward. He turned a corner of 
the footway and collided with a 
woman. He held her arm and 
pointed up. "Look! Do you see 
what I see? The stars are gone!" 1 

"What's gone?" 

"The stars. Don't you see? 
They're gone." 

"I don't know what you're 
talkin' about, pilot. C'mon, let's 
have us a ball." 

He tore himself away from her 
claws and ran. Halfway down the 
footway was a public phone alcove. He stepped in and dialed 
Information. The screen lit and 
a robot voice spoke: "Your question ?" 

"What's happened to the 
stars?" Reich asked. "When did 
it happen? It must have been noticed by now. What's the explanation?" 

There: was a click, a pause. 
"Will you spell the word, please?""

"Star!'* Reieh roared. "S-t-a-r. 
Star!" 

"Noun or verb?" 

"God damn you! Noun!" 

"There is no information listed 
under that heading," the canned 
voice announced. 

Reich swore, then fought to 
control himself. "Where's the 
nearest observatory?" 

"The Lunar Observatory at 
Croton Park is situated thirty 
miles north. It may be reached 
by Jumper Route North Coordinate 227. The Lunar Observatory 
was endowed in the year two 
thousand — " 

Reich slammed down the 
phone. "No information listed under that heading! Are they all 
crazy ?" He ran out into the 
streets* searching for a Public 
Jumper. A eab cruised past and 
Reich signaled. It swooped to 
pick him up. 

"Northco 227," he snapped ac 
he stepped in. *'The Lunar Observatory." 

The cab jetted. Reich restrained 
himself for five minutes, then began casually: "Notice the sky?" 

"Why, mister?" 

"The stars are gone." 

Sycophantic laugh. 

"It's not supposed to be a joke," 
Reich said. "The stars are gone." 

"If it ain't a joke, it needs explaining," the driver said. "What 
the hell ere stars?" 

Before Reich could erupt, the 
cab landed him on the observa


tory grounds. He snapped, "Wait 
for me," and ran across the lawn. 

He entered and heard the low 
whine of the dome mechanism 
and the quiet click of the observatory clock. Except for the low 
glow of the clock-light, the room 
was in darkness. He could see 
the observer, a dim outline 
crouched over the eyepiece of the 
telescope. 

"Listen," Reich said in a low 
voice. "Sorry to bother you, but 
you must have noticed. What's 
happened? Where are the stars?" 

The figure straightened slowly 
and turned toward Reich. "There 
are no stars," it said. 

The Man With No Face! 

TJE1CH flew out of the door, 
down the steps and across 
the lawn to the waiting cab. He 
blundered aga inst the crystal 
cabin wall and fell flat. 

The driver pulled him to his 
feet. "You all right, Mac?" 

"I don't know," Reich groaned. 

"None of my business, but I 
think you ought to see a peeper." 

Reich gripped the man. "I'm 
Ben Reich of Sacrament." 

"I recognized you." 

"Good. You know what I can 
do for you if you do me a favor? 
Money, new job, anything you 
want ..." 

"You can't do anything for 
me, Mac. I already been adjusted at Kingston." 

"Better. An honest man. Will

you do me an important favor?" 
"Sure, Mac." 

"Go into that building. Take a 
lopk at the man behind the tele- . 
scope. A good look. Come back 
and describe him to me." 

The driver departed, was gone 
five minutes, then returned and 
reported : "Sixtyish. Bald. Got 
lines in his face kinda deep. His 
ears stick out and he's got what 
they call a weak chin." 

"It's nobody . . . nobody," 
Reich muttered. 

"What?" 

"About the stars." Reich said. 
■"You never heard of them? You 
never saw them? You don't know 
what I'm talking about?" 

"Now don't get overdriven, 
Mac. Tell you something. They 
taught me plenty up at Kingston, 
like sometimes you get a crazy 
notion. For instance, that people 
always had one eye and now all , 
of a sudden they got two." 

Reich stared at him. 

"So you run around yellin": 
"Where did they all of a sudden 
get two eyes?* And they say : 'We 
always got two eyes.' And you 
say: 'The hell we did. I distinctly 
remember everybody got one eye/ 
And, by God, you believe it and 
they have a hell of a time knockuV 
the , notion outa you." The driver 
thumped him firmly. "Seems to 
me,; Mac, like you're on a one-eye 
kick." 

"One eye," Reich repeated. 
"Two eyes. Tension, apprehension 



and dissension have begun." 

"What?" 

"I ' ve had a rough time the 
last month. Maybe you're right." 

"You want to stay here and 
mope about stars?" 

"What do I care about stars!. 
I've got the world. What do I 
care if a few delusions go with 
it?" 

"That's the way, Mac, Where 
to?" 

"The Royal Palace." 
"The which?" 

Reich laughed. "S T-t," 
he said, and laughed all L»ie flight 
through the dawn to Sacrament's 
soaring tower. 

r | 1 HE night staff was in the last 
■*■ drowsy stages of the 12-8 
shift when Reich bustled in. As 
Reich went to his desk, he was 
followed by secretaries and subsecretaries carrying the urgent 
agenda of the day. 

"Let all that wait," he ordered. 
"Call in all department heads and 
organizational supervisors. I'm 
going to make an announcement." 

This was the only reality . . . 
the annunciator bells, the muted 
commands, the quick filling of 
his office with so many awed 
faces. All this was a preview of 
the future, when bells would ring 
on planets and satellites, and 
world supervisors would scuttle 
to his desk with awe on their 
faces. 

"As you all know," Reich be

gan, "we of Sacrament have been 
battling the D'Courtney Cartel 
until Craye D'Courtney was 
killed. The road is open for us 
now. We can commence operation 
of Plan A A to take over the 
D'Courtney Cartel." 

He paused, waiting for the excited murmur that should respond 
to his announcement. There was 
no response. 

"Perhaps," he said, "some of 
you do not comprehend the size 
and importance of the job. Those 
of you that are city supervisors 
will become continental supervisors. Continental supervisors 
will become satellite chiefs. Present satellite chiefs will become 
planetary chiefs. From now on, 
Sacrament will dominate the 
Sblsfe System. From now on, all 
of us must think in terms of the 
Solar System." 

Reich faltered, alarmed by the 
blank looks. He singled out the 
chief secretary. "What the hell's 
the matter? Bad news I haven't 
heard yet?" 

**N-no, Mr. Reich." 

"Then what's frabbing you? 
This is something we've all been 
waiting for. What's wrong with 

it?" 

"I've n-never heard of the organization, Mr. Reich. I . . . 
We . . . " The chief secretary 
turned around for support. Before Reich's unbelieving eyes, the 
entire staff shook their heads in 
mystification. 



"D'Courtney on Mars!" Reich 
shouted. 

"On where, sir?" 

"One of the ten planets. Fourth 
from the Sun. Mercury, Venus, 
Earth, Mars ! A hundred and 
forty-one million miles from the 
Sun! Mars!" 

They backed away slightly 
from Reich. He darted at the secretaries and tore the business 
papers from their hands. "You've 
got information about D'Courtney on Mars there. My God, 
we've been fighting D'Courtney 
for the last ten years!" • 

He clawed through the papers. 
There was not one reference to 
D'Courtney or Mars. There was 
no reference to Venus, Jupiter, 
the Moon, the other satellites. 

"I've got memos in my desk,* 1 
Reich shouted. "Hundreds of 
them! You're pulling something 
on me ..." 

He yanked out desk drawers. 
There was a stunning explosion. 
Fragments of flying wood slashed 
the staff, and Reich was hurled 
back against the window. 

"The Man With No Face!" 
Reich cried. He shook his head 
feverishly, and clung to the first 
problem. "Where are the files? 
I'll show you in the files . . . 
D'Courtney and Mars and all 
the rest. And I'll' sh6w the Man 
With No Facei too." 

He burst into the- file vaults, 
tore out rack after r^ckr scattering papers, clusters' of ' !; piezo'

GALAXY S'C I E N C £ f I C T I <J N 



crystals, microfilm, molecular 
transcripts. There was no reference to D'Courtney or Mars, none 
to Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, the 
asteroids, the satellites. 

Three burly gentlemen from 
Relations came trotting into the 
vaults. 

"Easy now, Mr. Reich," one 
said. "Easy .. . . " 

"Get away from me!" 

"Easy. It's all right, sir." 

They deployed strategically 
while the hustle and the bustle 
increased and the bells sounded 
and voices far off called: "Get 
his doctor." "Somebody call 
Kingston," "Did you notify the 
police?" "No, don't. No scandal." 
"Get Legal!" "Isn't the Infirmary 
open yet?" 

Reich overturned file* in the 
path of the burly gentlemen, 
raced through the office to the 
outside corridor and the Vertical 
Pneumatique, where he punched 
57. The door opened. He stepped 
into space and felt the circular 
steel plate snap again his soles 
and then drop him to the S7th 
floor. 

The Sacrament laboratory was 
in darkness. Still breathing heavily, he staggered to the lab library, snapped on the lights and 
went to the reference alcove. A 
sheet of frosted crystal, slanted 
like a drawing board, was set 
before a desk chair. There was a 
complicated panel of control buttons alongside it. 



Reich seated himself and 
punched ready. The crystal lit 
up and a canned voice spoke from 
an overhead speaker: "Class?" 
Reich punched science. "Section?" Reich punched astronomy. 
"Your question?" 

"The Universe." 

"The term universe in its complete physical sense applies to alt 
matter in existence." 

"What matter is in existence?" 

"Matter is gathered into aggregates ranging in size from the 
smallest atom to the largest collection of matter known to astronomers." 

"What is the largest collection 
of matter known to astronomers?" 
Reich punched diagram. 

"The Sun." The crystal plate 
displayed a dazzling picture of 
the Sun in speed-up action. 

"But what about the others? 
The stars?" 

"There are no stars." 

"The planets?" 

"There are no planets." 

"The Moon?" 

"There is no Moon." 

Reich took a deep, trembling 
breath. "We'll try it again. Go 
back to the Sun." 

The Sun appeared again in the 
crystal. "The Sun is the largest 
collection of matter known to 
astronomers," the canned voice 
began. Suddenly it stopped. The 
picture began to fade slowly. The 
voice spoke. "There is no Sun.** 

The model disappeared, leav

ing behind it an after-image that 
looked up at Reich . . . looming, 
silent, horrible . . . The Man With 
No Face. 

Reich picked up the chair and 
smashed it down on that frightful 
image. He blundered out of the 
library into the corridor. At the 
Vertical Pneumatique, he punched 
street. The door opened, he staggered in, was dropped 57 stories 
to the Main Hall of Sacrament 
Tower. 

It was filled with early workers 
hurrying to their offices. As Reich 
pushed past them, he caught the* 
astonished glances at his cut and 
bleeding face. Then he was aware 
of a dozen uniformed Sacrament 
guards closing in on him. He ran 
down the hall, slipped into the 
revoking doors and whirled 
through to the footway. There he 
jerked to a stop as though he 
had run into white-hot iron. 

The street lights were lit; the 
skyways twinkled; Jumper eyes 
floated up and down; the shops 
were blazing . . . and overhead 
there was nothing but a deep, 
black fathomless infinity. 

"The Sun! Where's the Sun?" 

Then the first of the guards 
came through the revolving door 
and he sprinted through an arcade of brilliant, busy shops. Beyond the arcade was the entrance 
of a Vertical Pneumatique to the 
skyway. Reich leaped in, was 
lofted 70 stories. 

There was a small car park 



shelved onto the face of Sacrament Tower, with a ramp leading 
into the skyway. Reich flung sovereigns to the attendant and got 
into a car. He pressed GO. The 
car went. At the foot of the runway, he pressed left. The car 
turned left and continued. That 
was all the control" he had — left, 
right; stop, go. The rest was automatic. Moreover, cars were 
strictly limited to the skyways. 
He might spend hours racing in 
circles high over the city. 

He glanced alternately over his 
shoulder and up at the sky. There 
was no Sun ... and they went 
about their business as though 
there had never been any. He 
shuddered. Was this more of the 
one-eye kick? 

Suddenly the car slowed and 
stopped. He was marooned in 
the middle of the skyway, halfway between Sacrament Tower 
and the Chanin Building. 

Reich hammered on the control studs. There was no response. 
He leaped out and raised the tail 
hood to inspect the pickup. Then 
he saw the guards far down the 
skyway, running toward him, and 
he understood. These cars were 
powered by broadcast energy. 
They'd cut the broadcast off at 
the car park and were coming 
after him. 

Reich stumbled toward the 
Chanin Building. The skyway 
tunneled through the building 
and was lined with shops, res

taurants, a Panty theater — and 
there was a travel office! He could 
grab a ticket, get into a one-man 
capsule and have himself slotted 
to any of the takeoff fields. He 
needed a little time to reorganize 
and he had a house in Paris. 

He leaped across the center 
island, dodged past cars and ran 
into the office. It looked like a 
miniature bank. A short counter. 
A grilled window protected 
by burglar-proof plastic. Reich 
slapped gold coins down on the 
counter. 

"Ticket to Paris," he said. 
"Keep the change." 

"There is no such place," came 
the reply. 

Reich stared through the 
cloudy plastic and saw . . . looking, looming, silent . . . the Man 
With No Face. 

Skull pounding, he ran blindly 
on to the skyway, shied feebly 
from an oncoming car, and was 
struck down into enveloping 
darkness — 

ABOLISH:

and physiography) 
EXPUNGE:

ERASE:

and paleogeography) 
ANNUL . ; . 

A hand was placed over his 



mouth. Reich opened his eyes. He 
was in a small tiled room, an 
emergency police station. He was 
lying on a white examination 
table. Around him were the 
guards, three uniformed police, 
unidentified strangers. 

The stranger removed his 
hand from Reich's mouth. "It's 
all right," he said gently. "I'm a 
doctor." 

"Are you a peeper? I need a 
peeper. I need somebody inside 
my head to prove I'm right." 

"What's he want?" a policeman asked. 

"I don't know. He said a 
peeper." The doctor turned back 
to Reich. "What's a peeper?" 

"An Esper. A mind reader. 
A—" 

The doctor smiled. "Show of 
high spirits. Many patients do 
that after accidents. We call it 
gallows humor ..." 

"Listen," Reich said desperately. "My name is Reich. Ben 
Reich of Sacrament. You know 
me. I want to confess. Take me to 
Preston Powell." 

"Who's Powell?" 

"What do you want to confess?" 

"I murdered Craye D'Courtney last month. In Maria Beaumont's house. I want to tell 
Powell " 

The police looked at each other 
in surprise. One of them drifted 
to a corner and picked up an oldfashioned hand phone: "Captain? 



THI DEMOLISHED MAN 



Got a character here. Calls himseld Ben Reirh of Sacrament. 
Claims he killed a party named 
Craye D'Courtney last month." 
After a pause, he grunted and 
hung up. "A nut," he said. 

"Listen — " Reich began. 

"Is he all right?" the policeman 
ssked the doctor. 

"Just shaken a little." 

"Listen!" Reich shouted. 

The policeman yanked him to 
his feet and propelled him toward 
the door of the station. "There 
ain't no Preston Powell on the 
force. There ain't no D'Courtney 
killing on the books. Now, out!" 
And he hurled Reich into the 
street. 

Reich stumbled, then regained 
his balance and stood still, numb, 
lost. A few street lights were lit. 
The skyways were extinguished. 
There were great gaps shorn in 
the skyline. 

He began to lurch down the 
broken streets with arms clutching his belly. 

"Cab!" he yelled. "Taxicab!" 
Jumper! Where is everything? 
Cab!" 

There was nothing. 

"Isn't there anybody can hear 
me? I'm sick. I need help . . . 
Got to get home." 

There was nothing. 

He moaned again. Then he 
tittered, weakly, inanely. He sang 
in a defiant voice: "Eight, sir, 
five, sir, one. sir! Tenser, said 
tensor . . . tension, 'prehension, 




'sension have b-begun!" 

He gripped T8's shaking elbow and marched him through 
Beaumont House. As he walked 
he called plaintively: "Hey, where 
is everybody? Maria!" 

T8 emitted a hysterical sob. 
Reich shook him roughly. "Play 
up! We'll be out of here in five 
minutes. Then you can start worrying." 

"If they find the body before 
we leave, we're sunk." 
"Who'll find the body?" 
"Th£ guards." 
"They've been ionized." 
"Servants." 

"They won't leave the kitchens

tell you we'll be safe in five 
minutes." 

"But if we're trapped here, we 
won't be able to get the girl. 
We'll— " 

"We won't be trapped." Reich 
pushed open the door of the projection room. "Hey, where is everybody?" 

No answer. 

There was no door, no projection room. He was standing at 
9 Park South, looking for the 
Beaumont Mansion, the site of 
D'Courtney's death . . . and Maria Beaumont, shrill, decadent, 
reassuring, 

There was a black tundra. Unfamiliar desolation. Nothing. 



"For God's sake!" he cried. 
"Where is everything? Stop this 
crazy Sardine game! Bring it all 
back! Fill up the empty space!" 

From far across the desolation, 
a figure approached , , . looking, 
looming, silent. The Man With 
No, Face. Reich watched it approach, paralyzed. 

Then the shadowy figure spoke: 
"There is no space. There is 
nothing." 

The screaming in Reich's ears 
was his voice, and the hammering was his heart. He was running, running down a yawning 
alien path, devoid of life, devoid 
of space, running while there was 
still time, time, time — 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

He ran headlong into a figure 
of black shadows. A figure without a face. A figure that said: 
"There is no time. There is nothing." 

Reich backed away He turned. 
He fell. He crawled feebly through 
eternal emptiness, shrieking: 
"Powell! Duffy! Hassop! Quizzard! T8! Church! Where is everybody? Where is everything? 
For the love of God!" 

And he was face to face with 
the Man With No Face, who said: 
"There is no God. There is nothing except you and me." 

Reich raised his eyes and stared 
deep into the face of his deadly 
enemy, the man he could not 
escape, the terror of his nightmares, the destroyer of his existence. 

It Vvas — 

Himself. 

D'Courtney. 

Both. 

Two faces, blending into one. 
Ben D'Courtney. Craye Reich. 
D' Courtney -Reich. 

He could make no sound. He 
could make no move. There was 
neither time nor space nor matter. 
There was nothing left but dying 
thought. 

"Fatlier?" 

"Son." 

" You are me?" . 
"We are us." 

"I don't understand. What's 
happened?" 

"You lost the game, Ben." 



"The Sardine Game?" 

"The Cosmic Game." 

"I won. I owned every bit of 
the world." 

"'And therefore you lose. We 
Jose" 

"Lose what?" 

"Survival." 

"I can't understand!" 

"My part of us understands, 
Ben. You would understand, too, 
if you hadn't driven me from 
you." 

"How did I dri ve you from 

me?" 

"With every corruption in 
you." 

"You say that, you betrayer?" 

"That was without passion, 
Ben. That was to destroy you 
before you could destroy us, to 
help you lose the world and win 
the game" 

"What game? What Cosmic 
Game?" 

"The maze. The labyrinth. The 
galaxies, the stars, the Sun, the 
planets, the moons . . that was 
the problem box we were to solve. 
We were the only reality. All the 
rest was make-believe, toys for 
us to play with, dolls, puppets, 
stage- settings, pretended passions. 
It was a make-believe reality 
for us to solve." 

"I conquered it. I owned it." 

"And you failed to solve it. I 
don't know what the solution is, 
but it's not theft, terror, hatred, 
lust, murder, rapine. You failed, 
and it's all been abolished, de

jnolished, disbanded ..." 

"Then what's to become of us?" 
''We're disbanded too." 
"Why? Who We we? What are 

we?" 

"Did the seed from our makebelieve universe know who or 
what it was when it did not find 
fertile soil and {ailed nature's 
survival test? Did the dying sperm 
know who or what it was when 
it failed to find the egg? Does it 
matter who or what we are? We 
have failed. We are ended." 

"But we did exist!" 

"Perhaps if we had solved it, 
Ben, it might have remained real, 
and all that we knew and loved 
might be with us still. But it is 
ended. Reality has turned into 
might-have-been, and you have 
awakened at last . . . to nothing." 

"We'll go back! We'll try it 
again!" 

"There is no going back. It is 
ended." 

"Well find a way. There must 
be something ..." • 
"There is nothing. It is ended." 
"Is this death?" 

"How can there be death when 
there never was life? It is ended. 
We are merging, fading, disappearing. It is — *' 

Ended.

*X ,I HEY found the two men next 
morning, in the gardens overlooking the old Harlem Canal. 



Powell was seated cross-legged on 
the wet turf, his face shriveled, 
his respiration almost gone, his 
pulse almost faded. Reich was 
curled into a tight fetal ball, completely catatonic. 

They rushed Powell to his home 
on Hudson Ramp, where the entire Guild Lab team first sweated 
over him and then congratulated 
themselves on the first successful 
Mass Cathexis Measure in the 
history of the Esper Guild. There 
was no hurry for Reich. In due 
course and with proper procedure, 
his inert body was transported to 
Kingston Hospital. 

Eight days later, Powell arose, 
bathed, dressed, successfully defeated his nurses in single combat and left the house. He made 
one stop at Sucre et Cie., emerged 
with a parcel and then proceeded 
to headquarters to make his personal report to Commissioner 
Crabbe. 

On the way up, he poked his 
head into $$on's office. 

"Hi Chas. Did Peetcy back us 
tip on the D'Courtney murder 
motive?" 

"Lock, stock «> barrel. Trial 
took one hour. Reich's going 
through Demolition now." 

"That's nice. I'd better go up 
now and s-p-e-l-1 it out for 
Crabbe." 

"What you got under your 
arm?" 

"Present." 

"For Crabbe?"

"The kind I'd give him art 

against the taw." 
"See you." 

Powell went up to Crabbe's 
ebony and silver office. Crabbe 
was properly solicitous, but stiff. 
The D'Courtney case had not improved his bitter relations with 
Powell. 

"Conviction," he said belligerently. "Damned if I see proper 
evidence." 

"It was a remarkably complex 
case, sir," Powell replied tact' 
fully. "None of us could under „ stand it. Even Reich himself was 
not aware of why he had murdered D'Courtney. The only one 
who grasped the case was the 
Prosecution Transistor Computer." 

'IPeetcy did? How?" 

"When we ran our final data 
through the first time, Peetcy told 
us that the 'passion motive' was 
insufficiently documented. We'd 
all been assuming profit motive. 
So had Reich. That was his conscious camouflage for die real 
passion motive. It couldn't hold 
up as evidence because he offered 
merger to D'Courtney — and 
D'Courtney accepted! Reich misunderstood the message. He had 
to. He had to go on believing 
he murdered D'Courtney for 
money." 

"Why?" 

"Because he couldn't face the 
real motive ..." 
"Which was?" 



"D'Courtney was his father.*" 
"What!" Crabbe stared. "His 
father? His flesh and blood?" 

"Yes, sir. It was all there before us. We just couldn't see it 
. . . because Reich himself 
couldn't see it. That estate on 
Callisto, for instance, the one 
Reich used to lure Dr. J^maine 
off the planet — Reich inherited it 
from his mother, who'd receive it 
from D'Courtney. We all assumed 
Reich's father had chiseled it out 
of D'Courtney in some kind of 
transaction and placed it in his 
wife's name. We were wrong. 
D'Courtney had given it to 
Reich's mother because it was 
his love-gift to the mother of his 
child." 

Crabbe opened his mouth, then 
closed it. 

"And there were other signposts. D'Courtney's suicide drive, 
produced by intense guilt sensations of desertion. He had abandoned his son. It was tearing 
him apart. Now add Barbara 
D'Courtney's half-twin image of 
herself and Ben Reich. Somehow she felt they were halfbrother and sister. Reich's inability to kill Barbara — he knew it, 
too, deep in his unconscious. 
He wanted to destroy the hateful 
father who had rejected him, but 
he could not bring himself to 
harm his sister." 

"When did you unearth all 
this?" 

"When Reich attacked me for 



SALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



setting those boobytraps." 

"Damn it, Powell, someone had 
to set them I If you didn't, who 
did?" 

"Reich himself, sir." 

"Reich!" 

"He murdered his father, which 
discharged his hatred. But his 
conscience could not permit him 
to go unpunished for such a horrible crime. Since the police apparently were unable to punish 
him, his conscience took over. 
That was the meaning of Reich's 
nightmare image." 

"The Man With No Face?" 

"Yes, Commissioner. It was the 
symbol of Reich's real relationship to D'Courtney. It had no 
face because Reich could not accept the truth. It was first the 
threat of punishment for what 
he contemplated. Then it became 
the punishment itself for the 
murder." 

"The boobytraps?" 

"Exactly. Reich set those traps 
for himself without ever realizing 
it ... in brief departures from 
conscious reality. The tricks of 
the unconscious are fantastic." 

"But if Reich himself knew 
none of this, how did you get at 
it, Powell?" 

"We used the Mass Cathexis 
Measure, sir. It's difficult to explain, but I'll do my best. Every 
human being has a psyche composed of latent and capitalized 
energy. Latent energy is our reserve . .. . the uptapped natural 



resources of our mihd. Capitalized 
energy is that latent energy which 
we call up and put to work. Most 
of us use only a small portion 
of our latent energy." 

"I understand." 

"When the Esper Guild uses 
the Mass Cathexis Measure, every 
Esper opens his psyche, so to 
speak, and contributes his latent 
energy to a pool. One Esper alone 
taps this pool and becomes the 
canal for the latent energy. He 
capitalizes it and puts it to work. 
He can accomplish tremendous 
things ... if he can control it. 
It's a difficult and dangerous operation. About on a par with jetting to the Moon with a stick 
of dynamite — er — riding on dynamite sticks." 

Suddenly Crabbe grinned. "I 
wish I were a peeper," he said. 
"I'd like to get the real image 
in your mind." 

"You've got it already, sir.** 
Powell grinned back. An entente 
cordial had been established between them for the first time. "It 
was necessary," Powell continued, 
"to bring Reich face to face with 
the Man With No Face. We had 
to make him see the truth before 
we could get the truth. Using the 
pool of latent energy, I built a 
common neurotic concept for 
Reich . . . the illusion that he 
alone in the world was real." 

"Why, I've often — is that common?" 

"One of the run-of-the-mill es


cape pattern* When life get* 
tough for you, you take refuge 
in the idea that it's all a giant 
hoax. Reich had the seeds of 
that in him already. I simply 
forced them. I tore it all down 
and I very nearly tore myself 
apart doing it . . . but I left 
Reich alone in nothingness with 
the Man With No Face. Then, 
because there was nowhere else 
to look, he looked into the face 
and saw himself and his father. 
Once we had that, we had everything we needed." 

Powell picked up his parcel and 
arose. Crabbe jumped up and escorted ^him to the door with a 
friendly hand on his shoulder. 

"You've done a phenomenal 
job, Powell. Really phenomenal. 
All J can say is that it must be a 
wonaerful thing to be an Esper. 
You must all be very happy." 

Powell paused at the door. 
"Would you be happy to live 
your life in a hospital, Commissioner?" 

"A hospital?" 

"That's where we Espers live 
... all of us. In the psychiatric 
ward. Without escape, without 
refuge. Be grateful you're not a 
peeper, sir. Be grateful that you 
see only the outward man. Be 
grateful that you never see the 
passions, the hatreds, the jealousies, the malice, the sicknesses. 
The world will be a wonderful 
place when everyone's a peeper 
and properly adjusted. But until 



then, be grateful you're blind." 

He left headquarters, hired a 
Jumper and was jetted north toward Kingston Hospital. He sat 
in the cabin with the parcel on 
his knees, gazing down at the 
magnificent Hudson valley. 

Kingston Hospital came into 
view, acre upon rolling acre of 
magnificent landscaping, solar iums, pools, lawns, athletic fields, 
dormitories, clinics, all in exquisite neo-classic design. As the 
Jumper descended, Powell could 
make out the figures of patients 
and attendants, bronzed, active, 
laughing, playing. 

He checked in at the Visitors 
Office, found Barbara D'Courtney's location and started across 
the grounds. He was weak, but 
felt impelled to leap hedges, vault 
gates, run races. He had awakened from his siege with Reich 
with a sudden knowledge that 
exhilarated him. It was a fact 
always known to him, he realized, 
but deliberately concealed by his 
sense of responsibility. 

*'I really have got too damned 
much super-ego," he grumbled. "It takes itself so seriously." 

They saw each other at the 
same moment, across a broad 
stretch of lawn flanked by fieldstone terraces and brilliant rockgardens. She flew toward him, 
waving, and he ran toward her. 
Then, as they approached, both 
were stricken with shyness. They 
stopped a few feet apart, not

daring to look at each other. 
"Hello." 

"Hello, Barbara." He paused. 
"Let's get into the shade." 

They turned toward the terrace 
wall. Powell glanced at her from 
the corner of his eye. She was 
alive as he had never seen her. 
And the urchin expression in her 
face — the expression that he had 
imagined was a phase of her 
Deja Eprouve ^development — was 
still there. She looked inexpressibly mischievous, high-spirited, 
fascinating. But she was adult. 
He did not know her. 

"I'm being discharged this evening," Barbara said. 

"I know." 

They sat down on a stone 
bench. She looked at him with 
grave eyes. "I want to tell you 
how grateful I am." 

"Please, Barbara. You're making me uncomfortable." 

"Am I?" 

"I knew you so intimately as — 
well, as a child. Now — " 

"Now I'm grown up again." 
"Yes;' 

"You must get to know me 
better. Shall we say tea tomorrow 
at five? Informal." 

"Listen," Powell said desperately. "I helped dress you more 
than once. And comb your hair. 
And brush your teeth." 

She waved her hand airily. 

"You liked fish, but you hated 
lamb. You hit me in the eye with 
a chop.' 1 '* 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN ' 



"That was ages ago, Mr. Powell." 

"That was two weeks ago, Miss 
D'Courtney." 

She arose with magnificent 
poise. "Really, Mr. Powell! If you 
feel impelled to cast chronographical aspersions . . ." She stopped 
and looked at him. The urchin 
appeared again in her face. 
"Chronographical?" she inquired. 
* He dropped the parcel and 
caught her in his arms. 

"Mr. Powell," she murmured. 
"Hello, Mr. Powell" 

"My God, Barbara — Baba, 
dear. For a moment I thought 
you meant it." 

"I was paying you back for 
being grown up." 

"You always were a vindictive 
kid." 

"You always were a mean 
daddy." She leaned back and 
looked at him. "Mary Noyes told 
me. Everything." 

"Oh. She did?" 

Barbara nodded. "She was 
right. I'll settle for anything." 

He laughed, the exhilaration 
bubbling vibrantly from him. 
"You won't have to settle for 
anything. Sit down. I want to 
ask you something." 

She sat down. 

On his lap. 

"I have to go back to that 
night," he said. 

"In Beaumont House?" 
He nodded. 

"It's not easy to talk about,"

under his arm. "This, for example, woutd have been called 
gushing sentimentally over an 
outlaw of society." 

Jeems watched silently, sympathetically, as Powell held out 
the package to what was left of 
Reich. "It's a present for you, 
Ben. Take it." The creature glowered at Powell and then at the 
box.' At last the clumsy hands 
took the gift, tore away the wrappings, scooped up a handful of 
Sucre et Cie.'s magnificent candies and stuffed them into the 
lax mouth. 

"He's done all right in the gift 
department," Jeems said, nodding 
at the flowers, piezo crystal recordings, pieces of sculpture, a 
cage of small, active animals from 
VeAus, and exotic Ampro plants 
that covered the tables and 
shelves in the room. 

"From Commissioner Crabbe, 
old T-H himself. Dr. Wilson 
J^maine," said Powell, reading 
the cards. He paused at one. 
"Jeremy Church, too. After the 
way Church hated Reich for getting him expelled from the Esper 
Guild . . . damn it, Johnny, it's 
hard to believe, isn't it?" 

"No," Jeems said. "Why should 



it be? A criminal is a sick person. 
Naturally you put him in the 
hospital and send him gifts. How 
else should any criminal be 
treated?" 

"How else indeed?" Powell repeated gently. 

Out of the chaos in Reich's 
stripped mind came a fragment of 
thought; "Powell — peeper — Powell — friend ..." 

It was so sudden, so unexpected, so passionately grateful 
that Powell gripped Reich's 
shoulder and tried to smile, then 
had to turn and hurry out toward 
the pavilion and Barbara. 

One ill mind had been rescued. 
There had been fear and frustration, danger to the Solar System 
and to Powell and Barbara and 
to Reich himself, death for an 
old, guilt-ridden man too tired 
to live. But one sick personality 
had been saved. Some day it 
would be the entire human race. 
Until then, the Espers had to 
nurse and guard and guide a 
world that was diseased with 
psychic blindness. 

Was it worth it? 

Yes, Powell decided without 
hesitation, it was.

She put her head on his 

shoulder at . last, shaken, yet 
somehow at peace. Then the 
urchin smile came to her face as 
she glanced at the package he 
had put down on the bench beside him. 

"A present?" she wheedled. 
**For Baba?" 

He stood up, suddenly remembering. "No, of course not. It's 
for someone who needs it a good 
deal more.** He took her chin in 
his hand and kissed her again. 
"Run back to your pavilion and 
wait for me. There's somebody 
I've got to see. I'll be along soon 
... to take you home." 

She scampered off across the 
lawn, dangerously looking back 
at him instead of where she was 
going. Powell watched her go, 
partly to make sure she didn't 
crash into anything, mostly to 
feel the warmth of her love washing over his mind. Then he went 
to the Demolition Section of 
Kingston Hospital. 

When a man 'was Demolished 
at Kingston, his entire psyche 
was destroyed. The series of osmotic injections began with the 
topmost strata of cortical synapses and slowly worked down, 
switching off every circuit, extinguishing every memory, destroying every particle of the 
pattern that had been built up 
since birth. 

But this was not the pain nor 
the dread of Demolition. The hor


ror Jay in the fact that the consciousness was never lost ; that 
as the psyche was wiped out, the 
mind was aware of* the slow, 
backward death, until at last it, 
too, disappeared and awaited the 
rebirth. It was an eternity of farewells ... an agonizing funeral 
of oneself. And as Powell stood 
alongside Ben Reich's bed, he saw 
the awareness, the pain, the despair in those blinking, twitching 
eyes. 

Dr. Johnny Jeems put his hand 
on Reich's arm. "He's a lusty lad. 
We have great hopes for him." 

Reich squalled and writhed. 

"How's the treatment coming?" 
Powell asked anxiously. 

"Wonderful. Ought to be ready 
for rebirth in a year." 

"He's a great guy. We need 
men like him. It would have been 
a shame to lose Ben Reich." 

"Lose him?" Jeems repeated in 
astonishment. "How?" 

"Three or four hundred years 
ago, Johnny, cops caught people 
like Reich to kill them. Capital 
punishment, they called it." 

"It doesn't make sense, a man 
who's got the talent and guts 
to buck society obviously is valuable potentially. If you don't 
straighten him out and turn him 
into a plus value — hell, it would 
be a criminal human waste!" 

"They were pretty good at 
criminal human waste in those 
days," Powell said. He took the 
beautifully wrapped package from

she whispered miserably. 

"It won't take a minute. You 
were lying in bed, asleep. Suddenly you woke up and rushed 
into the Orchid room. You remember the rest . . . " 

"1 remember." 

"One question. What was the 
cry that woke you?" 
"You know." 

"I want you to say it. Say it 
out loud." 

"Do you think it's — it's going 
to send me into hysteria again?" 

"Say it." 

After a long pause, she said in 
a low voice, "Help, Barbara," and 
waited in fear. Nothing happened. 
She relaxed, though afraid. 

"Who shouted that?'" 

"My father, of course.** 

"^Ie couldn't shout, Barbara. 
His throat was gone. Cancer. He 
could barely whisper." 

"But I heard him!" 

*'You peeped him." 

She stared. 

"You peeped him," Powell repeated gently. "Your father cried 
out on the telepathic level. You 
heard him. There was no other 
way you could have heard him 
except telepathically." 

"But that would mean I'm an 
Esper," she objected. "I'm not 
one at all." 

"In spite of proof that you 
are?" 

"It's just your opinion," she 
said insistently. "Maybe just a 
hope." 



"Do you love me?" Powell , shot 
at her. 

"I love you, of course," she 
answered, "but I think you're inventing excuses to — " 

"Who asked you?" 

"Asked me what?" 

"If you loved me." 

"Why, you just — " 

"I didn't say anything," he told 
her quietly. "I thought my question; you peeped me. You were 
unconsciously peeping Mary and 
me all the while you were in my 
house. You peeped Reich when 
he came there to set a boobytrap 
for me. Don't you understand 
now, Barbara?" 

"Oft, if it were only true!** 

"it is, darling. You won't have 
to settle for anything short of us. 
You're a latent Esper. You'll be 
trained, of course ... as a Guild 
member and my wife. You heard 
me, didn't you?" 

"Yes, Preston," she whispered. 

"One of the first things you'll 
learn is that words aren't necessary," he said. "Now, for example." 

Their kiss was long and deep, 
but not a fraction as urgent and 
hungry as the need they read 
clearly in each other. This, he let 
her realize without words, while 
their lips were still together, was 
why an Esper could love only 
another Esper . . . and why Esper 
love was to deaf-mute love as 
animal instinct was to human 
reasoning.
