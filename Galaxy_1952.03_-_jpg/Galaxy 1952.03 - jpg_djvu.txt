In This Corner 



WITH this issue, Willy 
Ley begins his monthly 
department "For Your 
Information." It should be interesting and useful in many ways. 
For one thing, Mr v Ley proposes 
to have a good deal of variety, 
ranging from ' complete articles, 
like this month's study of moons, 
to brief reports on significant developments in science. ' . 

In addition, he has undertaken 
the job of answering all questions 
submitted by readers, either in 
the magazine or by mail. Please 
be reasonable, though — it isn't 
fVit^to ask him to write a complete thesis. If that sounds preposterous, you don't know the 
crust of some people. Names and 
addresses will be used unless there 
is a specific request to withhold 
them. The ones in this issue were 
sent directly to Mr. Ley and not 
to the magazine, so there is a 
legal barrier to printing the 
names, even though the senders 
may approve or actually desire it. 

In addressing your queries to 
Mr. Ley, send them to GALAXY 
Pu Wishing Corp., 42 1 Hudson 
Street, New York 14. // you have 
other matters to discuss at the 
same time, please put them on 
one sheet and the question(s') on 
another. We don't want to cut 



up letters so that Mr. Ley will 
get whatever applies to his department and we retain the restVery untidy and hell on filing. 

Willy. Ley is precisely the man 
"to run a feature like this, which, 
provides a fine opportunity to 
tell you something about him. 

He was born in Germany in 
1906, and, like many of us who 
belong roughly to the same generation, spent considerable time 
hunting through the libraries for 
science fiction in his youth. However, he was hit by a stroke of 
luck that might have killed us 
with joy — he became an officer of 
the German Rocket Society in 
1927, and then technical adviser 
for UFA on such dream moviei 
as "The Girl in the Moon," "Metropolis," etc. 

By the way. if you happen to 
have a print of "The Girl in the 
Moon," or know someone who 
has, he and Fritz Lang, the director, would be enormously 
grateful for the chance to make a 
print at their own expense. You 
will naturally be given credit for 
your invaluable aid. 

Mr. Ley's life, as well as many 
others', became complicated by 
a painter of exceedingly mean 
ability and even meaner politics 
and ethics. In 19*5. Mr. Ley 



1 



3 A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



thought it advisable to go elsewhere. Hence, America has a 
pretty wonderful citizen, who has 
helped greatly in the development and popularization of rocketry. His books are authoritative; 
he is consulted as an expert and 
is in hot demand as a speaker. 

One specialty might be enough 
for most people, but Willy Ley 
is also a noted naturalist and 
has never been referred to as a 
slouch in the physical sciences. 

Mr. Ley is about five-eleven 
and seems to weigh 190 pounds; 
he has a calm and reasonable disposition, but I would not advise 
anyone to ask him to take off 
his black-rimmed eyeglasses and 
step outside. 

He is married to an artist and 
ballet dancer named Olga, a 
dainty creature of astonishing 
grace and endurance. Keeping 
two small girls disentangled from 
piles of research material is a 
major job, but she also manages 
to illustrate much of his work. 

It's an honor to have Willy Ley 
as a contributing editor. He is 
waiting for your questions; don't 
let him go to waste. 

A GRATIFYING number of 
readers have asked what I'm 
like. This should be one of my 
favorite subjects, but the truth 
is that my life is an old story to 
me. 

I'm five-nine, 155 stripped (I 



just weighed myself at the corner 
drugstore to verify). Born in 
Montreal in 1914 in the first 
month of World War I. Named 
H(orace) L(eonard) after a 
prompt casualty in the Princess 
Pat Regiment. I can't pretend to 
be fond of my name, but I don't 
use initials to escape it; that was 
decided upon by an editor, though 
other editors have used the whole 
thing. Having had 32 pen names, 
I find the problem shrug-worthy. 

Educated in the U. S., though 
frustrated as a small boy when 
all history books agreed England 
lost the Revolutionary War. 

Married (September, 1939) and 
have one son (born December, 
1941) and am not superstitious, 
knock on wood, but hesitate to 
get born or married again or have 
another kid. 

Had the usual jobs while learning to write: junior pharmacist, 
shoe salesman, floor scraper, apprentice upholsterer, etc. Wrote 
and sold over 5,000,000 words and 
edited or published more than 
two dozen magazines of all kinds. 

GALAXY, of course, is my 
own dream come true. I know 
I sometimes push too Hard, but 
that's because everyone wants his 
dream to be perfect. 

Apprehensive readers have 
asked if I'm susceptible to "scientific" fads or cults. I'd turn in 
my blue pencil first.

OF THE JACKPOT 



By ROBERT A. NEINLEIN 

Occasionally, a story has to be dearly 
labeled fiction. Here h one instance — 




AT first Potiphar Breen did 

/% not notice the girl who 
./ ^ was undressing. 

She was standing at a bus stop 
only ten feet away. He was indoors, but that would not have 
kept him from noticing; he was 
seated in a drugstore booth adjacent to the bus stop; there was 
nothing between Potiphar and 
the young lady but plate glass 
and an occasional pedestrian. 

Nevertheless he did not look up 
when she began to peel. Propped 
up in front of him was a Los 
Angeles Times ; beside it. still 
unopened, were the Herald- Express and the Daily News. He 
was scanning the newspaper carefully, but the headline stories 
got only a passing glance. 

He noted the maximum 
and minimum temperatures in 
Brownsville. Texas, and entered 
them in a neat black notebook. 
He did the same with the closing 
prices of three blue chips and 



THI YIAI OF THE JACKPOT

two dogs on the New York Exchange, as well as the total number of shares. 

He then began a rapid sifting 
of minor news stories, from time 
to time entering briefs of them 
in his little book. 

The items he recorded seemed 
randomly unrelated — among 
them a publicity release in which 
Miss National Cottage Cheese 
Week announced that she intended to marry and have twelve 
children by a man who could 
prove that he had been a lifelong 
vegetarian, a circumstantial but 
wildly unlikely Flying Saucer 
report, and a call for prayers 
for rain throughout Southern 
California. 

Potiphar had just written down 
the names and addresses of three 
residents of Watts, California, 
who had been miraculously 
healed at a tent meeting of the 
God-is-All First Truth Brethren 
by the Reverend Dickie Bottomley, the eight-year-old evangelist, 
and was preparing to tackle the 
Herald- Express, when he glanced 
over his reading glasses and saw 
the amateur ecdysiast on the 
Street corner outside. 

He stood up, placed his glasses 
in their case, folded the newspapers and put them carefully in 
his right coat pocket, counted out 
the exact amount of his check 
and added fifteen per cent. He 
then took his raincoat from a< 



hook, placed it over his arm, and 
went outside. 

BY now the girl was practically 
down to the buff. It seemed 
to Potiphar Breen that she had 
quite a lot of buff, yet she had 
not pulled much of a house. The 
corner newsboy had stopped 
hawking his disasters and wai 
grinning at her, and a mixed pair 
of transvestites who were apparently waiting for the bus had 
their eyes on her. 1 None of the 
passers-by stopped. They glanced 
at her, and then, with the selfconscious indifference to the unusual of the true Southern Cali* 
fornian, they went on their 
various ways. 

The transvestites were frankly 
staring. The male member of the 
team wore a frilly feminine 
blouse, but his skirt was a conservative Scottish kilt. His female companion wore a business 
suit and Homburg hat; she stared 
with lively interest. 

As Breen approached, the girl 
hung a scrap of nylon on the bus 
stop bench, then reached for her 
shoes. A police officer, looking 
hot and unhappy, crossed with 
the lights and came up to them. 

"Okay," he said in a tired 
voice, "that'll be all, lady. Get 
them duds back on and clear out 
of here." 

The female transvestite took a 
igar out of her mouth. "Just 



* 




 



bvaUN imsmrss is it of yours, officer?" she ;•*■■!<€ « J . 

The cop turned to her. "Keep 
out of this!" He ran his eyes 
over her getup, and that of her 
companion. "I ought to run both 
of you in, too." 

The transvestite raised her eyebrows. "Arrest us for being 
clothed, arrest her for not being. 
1 think I'm going t» like this." 
She turned to the girl, who was 
standing still and saying nothing, 
as if she were puzzled by what 
was going on. "I'm a lawyer, 
dear." She pulled a card from 
her vest pocket. "If this uniformed Neanderthal persists in 
annoying you, I'll be delighted 
to handle him." 

The man in kilts said, "Gracel 
Please!" 

She shook him off. "Quiet, 
Norman. This is our business." 
She went on to the policeman, 
"Well? Call the wagon. In the 
meantime, my client will answer 
no questions." 

T*he official looked unhappy 
enough to cry and his face was 
getting dangerously red. Breen 
quietly stepped forward and 
slipped his raincoat around the 
shoulders of the girl. 

She looked startled and spoke 
for the first time. "Uh — thanks." 
She pulled the coat about her, 
cape fashion. 

The female attorney glanced at 
Breen then back to the cop. 



"Well, officer? Ready to arerst 

us?" 

He shoved his face close to 
hers. "I ain't going to give you 
the satisfaction!" He sighed and 
added, "Thanks, Mr, Breen. You 
know this lady?" 

"I'll take care of her. You can 
forget it, Kawonski." 

"I sure hope so. If she's with 
you, r*D do just that. But get 
her out of here, Mr. Breen — 
please!" 

The lawyer interrupted. "Just 
a moment. You're interfering 
with my client." 

Kawonski said, "Shut up, you! 
You heard Mr. Breen — she's 
with him. Right, Mr. Breen?" 

"Well — yes. I'm a friend. I'll 
take care of her." 

The transvestite said suspiciously, "I didn't hear her say 
that." 

Her companion said, "Gracel 
There's our bus." 

"And I didn't hear her say she 
was your client," the cop retorted. "You look like a — " his 
words were drowned out by the 
bus brakes — "and besides that, 
if you don't climb on that bus 
and get off my territory, I'll . . . 

m 

-You'll what?" 

"Grace! We'll miss our bus.** 
"Just a moment, Norman. 
Dear, is this man really a friend 
of yours? Are you with him?" 
The girl looked uncertainly at 



Breen, then said in a low voice, 
**Uh, yes. He is. I am." 

"Well ..." The lawyer's companion pulled at her arm. She 
shoved her card into Breen's hand 
and got on the bus. It pulled 
away. 

Breen pocketed the card. 

KAWONSKI wiped his forehead. "Why did you do it. 
lady?" he said peevishly. 

The girl looked puzzled. "I — 
I don't know." 

"You* hear that, Mr, Breen? 
That's what they all say. And if 
you pull 'em in, there's six more 
the next day. The Chief said — " 
He sighed. "The Chief said — 
well, if I had arrested her like 
that female shyster wanted me 
to, I'd be out at a Hundred 
and Ninety-sixth and Ploughed 
Ground tomorrow morning, 
thinking about retirement. So get 
her out of here, will you?" 
The girl said, "But — * 
"No 'buts\ lady. Just be glad 
a real gentleman like Mr. Breen 
is willing to help you." He gathered up her clothes, handed them 
to her. When she reached for 
them, she again exposed an uncustomary amount of skin. Kawonski hastily gave the cloth ing to Breen instead, who 
crowded them into his coat 
pockets. 

She let Breen lead her to where 
his car was parked, got in and 



tucked the raincoat around her 
so that she was rather more 
dressed than a girl usually is. 
She looked at him. 

She saw a medium-sized and 
undistinguished man who was 
slipping down the wrong side of 
thirty-five and looked older. His 
eyes had that mild and slightly 
naked look of the habitual spectacles-wearer who is not at the 
moment with glasses. His hair 
was gray at the temples and 
thin on top. His herringbone suit, 
black shoes, white shirt, and neat 
tie smacked more of the East 
than of California. 

He saw a face which he classified as "pretty" and "wholesome" rather than "beautiful" 
and "glamorous." It was topped 
by a healthy mop of light brown 
hair. He set her age at twenty-five, 
give or take eighteen months. He 
smiled gently, climbed in without 
speaking and started his car. 

He turned up Doheny Drive 
and east on Sunset. Near La Cienega, he slowed down. "Feeling 
better?'* 

"Uh, I guess so Mr. — Breen?" 

"Call me Potiphar. What's 
your name? Don't tell me if you 
don't want to." 

"Me? I'm — I'm Meade Barstow." 

"Thank you, Meade. Where do 
you want to go? Home?" 

"I suppose so. Oh. my, no. I 
can't go home like this." She 



■ 



GAUXY SCIENCE FICTION 



clutched the coat tightly to her. 

"Parents?" 

"No. My landlady. She'd be 
shocked to death.** 
"Where, then?" 

She thought. "Maybe we could 
stop at a filling station and I 
could sneak into the ladies' 
room." 

"Maybe. See here, Meade — 
my house is six blocks from here 
and has a garage entrance. You 
could get inside without being 
seen." 

She stared. "You don't look 
like a wolf!" 

"Oh, but I am! The worst 
sort." He whistled and gnashed 
his teeth. "See? But Wednesday 
is my day off." 

She looked at him and dimpled. 
"Oh, well! I'd rather wrestle with 
you than with Mrs. Megeath. 
Let's go." 

TTfE turned up into the hills. 

His bachelor diggings were 
one of the many little frame 
houses clinging like fungus to the 
brown slopes of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. The garage was 
notched into this hill; the house 
sat on it. 

He drove in. cut the ignition, 
and led her up a teetery inside 
stairway into the living room. 

"In there," he said, pointing. 
"Help yourself." He pulled her 
clothes out of his coat pockets 
and handed them to her. 



She blushed and took them, 
disappeared into his bedroom. He 
heard her turn the key in the 
lock. He settled down in his easy 
chair, took out his notebook, and 
started with the Herald-Express. 

He was finishing the Daily 
News and had added several 
notes to his collection when she 
came out. Her hair was neatly 
rolled; her face was restored; she 
had brushed most of the wrinkles 
out of her skirt. Her sweater was 
neither too tight nor deep cut, 
but it was pleasantly filled. She 
reminded him of well water and 
farm breakfasts. 

He took his raincoat from her, 
hung it up, and said, "Sit down, 
Meade." 

She said uncertainly, "I had 
better go." 

"If you must, but I had hoped 
to talk with you." 

"Well — " She sat down on the 
edge of his couch * and looked 
around. The room was small, 
but as neat as his necktie and as 
clean as his collar. The fireplace 
was swept; the floor was bare and 
polished. Books crowded bookshelves in every possible space. 
One corner was filled by an 
elderly flat-top desk; the papers 
on it were neatly in order. Near 
it, en its own stand, was a small 
electric calculator. To her right, 
french windows gave out on a 
tiny porch over the garage. Beyond it she could see the sprawl

ing city, where a few neon signs 
were already blinking. 

She sat back a little. "This is 
a nice room — Potiphar. It looks 
like you." 

"I take that as a compliment. 
Thank you." She did not answer; 
he went on, "Would you like a 
drink?" 

"Oh, would I!" She shivered. "I 
guess I've got the jitters." 

He stood up. "Not surprising. 
What'll it be?" 

She took Scotch and water, no 
ice; he was a Bourbon -and -gin gerale man. She soaked up half 
her highball in silence, then put 
it down, squared her shoulders 
and said, "Potiphar?" 

"Yes, Meade?" 

"Look, if you brought me here 
to make a pass, I wish you'd go 
ahead and make it. It won't do 
you a bit of good, but it makes 
me nervous to wait." 

He said nothing and did not 
change his expression. 

She went on uneasily, "Not 
that I'd blame you for trying — 
under the circumstances. And I 
am grateful. But . . . well, it's 
just that I don't — *' 

He came over and took both 
her hands. "I haven't the slightest 
thought of making a pass at you. 
Nor need you feel grateful. I 
butted in because I was interested 
in your case." 

"My case? Are you a doctor? 
A psychiatrist?" 

10 



He shook his head. "I'm ■ 
mathematician. A statistician, to 
be precise." 

"Huh? I don't get it." 

"Don't worry about it. But I 
would like to ask some questions. 
May I?" 

"Oh, sure! Of course! I owe 
you that much — and then 
some." 

"You owe me nothing. Want 
your drink sweetened?" 

She gulped the balance and 
handed him her glass, then followed him out into the kitchen. 
He did an exact job of measuring 
and gave it back. 

"Now tell me why you took 
your clothes off," he said. 

C?HE frowned. "I don't know. 
*^ I don't know. I don't know. 
I guess I just went crazy." She 
added, round-eyed, "But I don't 
feel crazy. Could I go off my 
rocker and not know it?" 

"You're not crazy . . . not more 
so than the rest of us," he 
amended. "Tell me, where did 
you see someone else do this?" 

"Huh? I never have." 

"Where did you read about it?" 

"But I haven't. Wait a minute 
— those people up in Canada. 
Dooka-somethings." 

"Doukhobors. That's all? No 
bareskin swimming patties? No 
strip poker?" 

She shook her head. "No. You 
may not believe it, but I was the 

A t A X Y SCIENCE fICTIOM 



lrind of a little girl who undressed 
under her nightie." She colored 
and added, "I still do — unless 
I remember to tell myself it's 
•illy." 

"I believe it. No news stories?" 

"No. Yes, there was ! About 
two weeks ago, I think it was. 
Some girl in a theater — in the 
audience, I mean. But I thought 
it was just publicity. You know 
the stunts they pull here." 

He shook his head. "It wasn't. 
February 3rd, the Grand Theater, 
Mrs. Alvin Copley. Charges dismissed." 

"How did you know?" 

"Excuse me." He went to his 
desk, dialed the City News Bureau. "Alf? This is Pot Breen. 
They still sitting on that story? 
. . . Yes, the Gypsy Rose file. 
Any new ones today?" 

He waited. Meade thought that 
she could make out swearing. 

"Take it easy, Alf — this hot 
weather can't last forever. Nine, 
eh? Well, add another — Santa 
Monica Boulevard, late this afternoon. No arrest." He added, 
"Nope, nobody got her , name. 
A middle-aged woman with a 
cast in one eye. I happened to 
see it . . . who, me? Why would 
I want to get mixed up? But it's 
rounding into a very, very interesting picture." > 

He put the phone down. 

Meade said, "Cast in one eye, 
indeed!" 



"Shall I call him back and give 
him your name?" 
"Oh, nor 

"Very well. Now, Meade, we 
seemed to have located the point 
of contagion in your case — Mrs. 
Copley. What I'd like to know 
next is how you felt, what you 
were thinking about, when you 
did it." 

She was frowning intently. 
"Wait a minute, Potiphar. Do I 
understand that nine other girls 
have pulled the stunt I pulled?" 

"Oh, no. Nine others today. 
You are — " he paused briefly — 
"the three hundred and nineteenth case in Los Angeles 
County since the first of the year. 
I don't have figures on the rest 
of the country, but the suggestion 
to clamp down on the stories 
came from the eastern news services when the papers here put 
our first cases on the wire. That 
proves that it's a problem elsewhere, too." 

"You mean that women all 
over the country are peeling off 
their clothes in public? Why, how 
shocking!" 

TIE said nothing. She blushed 

again and insisted, "Well, 
it is shocking, even if it was me, 
this time." 

"No. Meade. One case is shocking; over three hundred makes it 
scientifically interesting. That's 
why I want to know how it felt.

Tell me about it.** 

"But — all right, I'll try. I 
told you I don't know why I did 
it: I still don't. I — " 

"You remember it?" 

"Oh, yes! I remember getting 
up off the bench and pulling up 
my sweater. I remember unzipping my skirt. I remember thinking I would have to hurry because 
I could see my bus stopped two 
blocks down the street. I remember how good it felt when I finally 
— " She paused and looked 
puzzled. "But I still don't know 
why." 

"What were you thinking about 
just before you stood up?" 

M I don't remember." 

"Visualize the street. What was 
passing by? Where were your 
hands? Were your legs crossed or 
uncrossed? Was there anybody 
near you? What were you thinking about?" 

"Nobody was on the bench 
with me. I had my hands in my 
lap. Those characters in the 
mixed-up clothes were standing 
nearby, but I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't thinking much 
except that my feet hurt and I 
wanted to get home — and how 
unbearably hot and sultry the 
weather was. Then — " her eyes 
became distant — "suddenly I 
knew what I had to do and it 
was very urgent that I do it. So 
I stood up and I — and I — " 
Her voice became shrill. 



"Take it easy!" he said sharply. 
"Don't do it again." 

"Huh? Why, Mr. Breed! t 
wouldn't do anything like that." 

"Of course not. Then what happened after you undressed?" 

"Why, you put your raincoat 
around me and you know the 
rest." She faced him. "Say Potiphar, what were you doing with 
a raincoat? It hasn't rained in 
weeks. This is the driest, hottest 
rainy season in years." 

"In sixty-eight years, to be 
exact." 

"Sixty — " 

"I carry a raincoat anyhow. 
Just a notion of mine, but I feel 
that when it does rain, it's going 
to rain awfully hard." He added, 
"Forty days and forty nights,, 
maybe." 

She decided that he was being 
humorous and laughed. 

He went on, "Can you remember how you got the idea of undressing?" 

She swirled her glass and 
thought. "I simply don't know." 

He nodded. "That's what I expected." 

"I don't understand — unlesi 
you think I'm crazy. Do you?" 

"No. I think you had to do it 
and could not help it and don't 
know why and can't know why."* 

"But you know." She said it 
accusingly. 

"Maybe. At least I have some 
figures. Ever take any interest m

statistics, Meade?** 

She shook her head. "Figurei 
confuse me. Never mind statistics 
— / want to know why I did 
what I did.'" 

He looked at her very soberly. 
**I th^nk we're lemmings. Meade.** 

QHE looked puzzled, then horrifled. "You mean those little 
furry mouselike creatures? The 
ones that — " 

"Yes. The ones that periodically make a death migration, untill millions, hundreds of millions 
of them drown themselves in the 
sea. Ask a lemming why he does 
it. If you could get him to slow 
up his rush toward death, even 
money says he would rationalize 
his answer as well as any college 
graduate. But he does it because 
he has to — and so do we." 

"That's a horrid idea, Potiphar." 

"Maybe. Come here. Meade. 
I'll show you figures that confuse 
me, too.*' He went to his desk 
and opened a drawer, took out a 
packet of cards. "Here's one. Two 
weeks ago, a man sues 'an entire 
state legislature for alienation of 
his wife's affection — and the 
judge lets the suit be tried. Or 
this one — a patent application 
for a device to lay the globe over 
on its side and warm up the arctic 
regions. Patent denied, but the inventor took in over three hundred 
thousand dollars in down pay


ments on North Pole real estate 
before the postal authorities 
stepped in. Now he's fighting the 
case and it looks as if he might 
win. And here — prominent 
bishop proposes applied courses 
in the so-called facts of life in 
high schools." 

He put the card away hastily. 
"Here's a dilly — a bill introduced in the Alabama lower 
house to repeal the laws of atomic 
energy. Not the present statutes, 
but the natural laws concerning 
nuclear physics: the wording 
makes that plain." He shrugged. 
"How silly can you get?" 

"They're* crazy." 

"No, Meade. One like that 
might be crazy; a lot of thern 
becomes a lemming death march. 
No, don't object — I've plotted 
them on a curve. The last time 
we had anything like this was the 
so-called Era of Wonderful Nonsense. But this one is much 
worse." He delved into a lower 
drawer, hauled out a graph. "The 
amplitude is more than twice at 
great and we haven't reached 
peak. What the peak will be, I 
don't dare guess — three separate rhythms, reinforcing." 

She peered at the curves. "You 
mean that the lad with the arctic 
real estate deal is somewhere on 
this line?" 

"He adds to it. And back here 
on the last crest are the flagpole 
sitters and the goldfish awallow

ers and the Ponzi hoax and the 
marathon dancers and the man 
who pushed a peanut up Pikes 
Peak with his nose. You're on the 
new crest — or you will be when 
I add you in." 

She made a face. "I don't like 
it " 

"Neither do I. But it's as clear 
as a bank statement. This year 
the human race is letting down 
its hair, flipping its lip. with a 
finger, and saying, 'Wubba, 
wubba, wubba.' " 

She shivered. "Do you suppose 
I could have another -drink? Then 
1*11 go.'* 

"I have a better idea. I owe 
you a dinner for answering questions. Pick a place and we'll have 
a cocktail before." 

She chewed her lip. "You don't 
owe me anything. And I don't 
feel up to facing a restaurant 
crowd. I might — I might — 

"No, you wouldn't," he said 
sharply. "It doesn't hit twice." 

"You're sure? Anyhow, I don't 
want to face a crowd." She 
glanced at his kitchen door. 
"Have you anything to eat in 
there? I can cook." 

"Urn, breakfast things. And 
there's a pound of ground top 
round in the freezer compartment 
and some rolls. I sometimes make 
hamburgers when I don't want to 
go out." 

She headed for the kitchen. 
"Drunk or sober, fully dressed or 



— or naked, I can cook. You'll 
see." 

TTE did see. Open-faced sand 
wiches with the meat married to toasted buns and the 
flavor garnished rather than suppressed by scraped Bermuda 
onion and thin-sliced dill, a 
salad made from things she had 
scrounged out of his refrigerator, 
potatoes crisp but not vulcanized. 
They ate it on the tiny balcony, 
sopping it down with cold beer. 

He sighed and wiped his mouth, 
"Yes, Meade, you can cook." 

"Some day I'll arrive with 
proper materials and pay you 
back. Then I'll prove it." 

"You've already proved it. 
Nevertheless, I accept. But I tell 
you three times — which makes it 
true, of course — that you owe 
me nothing." 

"No? If you hadn't been a Boy 
Scout, I'd be in jail." 

Breen shook his head. "The police have orders to keep it quiet 
at all costs — to keep it from 
growing. You saw that. And, my 
dear, you weren't a person to me 
at the time. I didn't even see your 
face." 

"You saw plenty else!" 

"Truthfully, I didn't look. You 
were just a — a statistic." 

She toyed with her knife and 
said puzzled, "I'm not sure, but 
I think I've just been insulted. In 
all the twenty-five years that I've

fought men off. more or less successfully, I've been called a lot 
of names — but a 'statistic?* Why, 
I ought to take your slide rule 
and beat you to death with it." 

"My dear young lady — " 

"I'm not a lady, that's for sure. 
But I'm not a statistic, either." 

"My dear Meade, then. I 
wanted to tell you, before you 
did anything hasty, that in college I wrestled varsity middleweight." 

She grinned and dimpled. 
''That's more the talk a girl likes 
to hear. I was beginning to be 
afraid you had been assembled 
in an adding machine factory. 
Potty, you're really a dear." 

"If that is a diminutive of my 
given name, I like it. But if it refers to my waist line, I definitely 
resent it." 

She reached across and patted 
his stomach. "I like your waist 
line; lean and hungry men are 
difficult. If I were cooking for 
you regularly, I'd really pad it." 

"Is that a proposal?" 

"Let it lie, let it lie. Potty, do 
you really think the whole 
country is losing its buttons?" 

He sobered at once. "It's worse 
than that." 

"Huh?" 

"Come inside. I'll show you." 

HPHEY gathered up dishes and 
dumped them in the sink, 
Breen talking all the while. 



"As a kid. I was fascinated by 
numbers. Numbers are pretty 
things and they combine in such 
interesting configurations. I took 
my degree in math, of course, and 
got a job as a junior actuary with 
Midwestern Mutual — the insurance outfit. That was fun. No 
way on Earth to tell when a particular man is going to die. but 
an absolute certainty that so 
many men of a certain age group 
would die before a certain date. 
The curves were so lovely — and 
they always worked out. Always. 
You didn't have to know why; 
you could predict with dead certainty and never know why. The 
equations worked ; the curves 
were right. 

"I was interested in astronomy, 
too; it was the one science where 
individual figures worked out 
neatly, completely, and accurately, down to the last decimal 
point that the instruments were 
good for. Compared with astronomy, the other sciences were 
mere carpentry and kitchen 
chemistry. 

"I found there were nooks and 
crannies in astronomy where individual numbers won't do, where 
you have to go over to statistics,, 
and I became even more interested. I joined the Variable Star 
Association and I might have 
gone into astronomy professionally, instead of what I'm in now 
— business consultation — if I 



THE YEAR OP THE JACKPOT 



IS 



hadnt gotten interested in something else." 

" "Business consultation?' " repeated Meade. "Income tax 
work?" 

"Oh, no. That's too elementary. 
I'm the numbers boy for a firm 
of industrial engineers. I can tell 
a rancher exactly how many of 
his Hereford bull calves will be 
sterile. Or I can tell a motion 
picture producer how much rain 
insurance to carry on location. Or 
maybe how big a company in a 
particular line must be to carry 
its own risk in industrial accidents. And I'm right. I'm always 
right." 

"Wait a minute. Seems to me 
a big company would have to 
have insurance." 

"Contrariwise. A really big corporation begins to resemble a 
statistical universe." 

"Huh?" 

"Never mind. I got interested in 
something else — cycles. Cycles 
are everything, Meade. And everywhere. The tides. The seasons. 
Wars. Love. Everybody knows 
that in the spring the young 
man's fancy lightly turns to what 
the girls never stopped thinking 
about, but did you know that it 
runs in an eighteen-year-plus 
cycle as well? And that a girl 
born at the wrong swing of the 
curve doesn't stand nearly as 
good a chance as her older or 
younger sister?" 



"Is thai why I'm still a doddering old maid?" 

"You're twenty-five?" He pondered. "Maybe, but your chances 
are improving again; the curve is 
swinging up. Anyhow, remember 
you are just one statistic; the 
curve applies to the group. Some 
girls get married every year." 

"Don't call me a statistic," she 
repeated firmly. 

"Sorry. And marriages match 
up with acreage planted to wheat, 
with wheat cresting ahead. You 
could almost say that planting 
wheat makes people gtt married." 

"Sounds silly." 

"It is silly. The whole notion 
of cause-and-effect is probably 
superstition. But the same cycle 
shows a peak in house building 
right after a peak in marriages." 

"Now that makes sense." 

"Does it? How many newlyweds do you know who can afford 
to build a house? You might as 
well blame it on wheat acreage. 
We don't know why; it just is." 

"Sun spots, maybe?" 

"You can correlate Sun spots 
with stock prices, or Columbia 
River salmon, or woman's skirts. 
And you are just as much justified in blaming short skirts for 
Sun spots as you are in blaming 
Sun spots for salmon. We don't 
know. But the curves go on just 
the same." 

"But there has to be some reason behind it.'"

CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Does there? That's mere assumption. A fact has no 'why.' 
There it stands, self-demonstrating. Why did you take your 
clothes off today?" 

She frowned. "That's not fair." 

"Maybe not. But I want to 
show you why I'm worried." 

"IJE went into the bedroom, 
came out with a large roll 
of tracing paper. 

"We'll spread it on the floor. 
Here they are. all of them. The 
54-year cycle — see the Civil 
War there? See how it matches 
in? The eighteen and one-thirdyear cycle, the 9-plus cycle, the 
41 -month shorty, the 'th*ree 
rhythms of Sun spots — everything, all combined in one grand 
chart. Mississippi River floods, 
fur catches in Canada, stock 
market prices, marriages, epidemics, freight-car loadings, bank 
clearings, locust plagues, divorces, 
tree growth, wars, rainfall, Earth 
magnetism, building construction, 
patents applied for. murders — 
you name it; I've got it there." 

She stared at the bewildering 
array of wavy lines. "But, Potty, 
what does it mean?" 

"It means that these things all 
happen, in regular rhythm, 
whether we like it or not. It means 
that when skirts are due to go up, 
all the stylists in Paris can't make 
'em go down. It means that when 
prices are going down, all the 



controls and supports and government planning can't make 'em 
go up." He pointed to a curve. 
"Take a look at the grocery ads. 
Then turn to the financial page 
and read how the Big Brains try 
to double-talk their way out of it. 
It means that when an epidemic 
is due, it happens, despite all the 
public health efforts. It means 
we're lemmings." 

She pulled her lip. "I don't like 
it. 'I am the master of my fate.' 
and so forth. I've got free will. 
Potty. I know I have — I can 
feel it." 

"I imagine every little neutron 
in an atom bomb feels the same 
way. He can go spung! or he can 
sit still, just as he pleases. But 
statistical mechanics work out all 
the same and the bomb goes off 

— which is what I'm leading up 
to. See anything odd there, 
Meade?" 

She studied the chart, trying 
not to let the curving lines confuse her. 

"They sort of bunch up over 
at the right end." 

"You're dern tootin' they do! 
See that dotted vertical line? 
That's right now — ■ and things 
are bad enough. But take a look 
at that solid vertical; that's about 
six months from now — and that's 
when we get it. Look at the cycles 

— the long ones, the short ones, 
all of them. Every single last one 
of them reaches either a trough or

a crest exactly on — or almost on 
— that line." 
"That's bad?" 

"What do you think? Three of 
the big ones troughed back in 
1929 and the depression almost 
ruined us . . . even with the big 
54-year cycle supporting things. 
Now we've got the big one 
troughing — and the few crests 
are not things that help. I mean 
to say, tent caterpillars and influenza don't do us any good. 
Meade, if statistics mean anything, this tired old planet hasn't 
seen a trend like this since Eve 
went into the apple business. I'm 
■cared."* 



She searched his face. "Potty, 
you're not simply having fun with 
me? You know I can't check up 
on you." 

"I wish to heaven I were. No, 
Meade, I can't fool about numbers; I wouldn't know how. This 
is it. 1952 — The Year of the

to go.

MARRIAGE SOLEMNIZED ON 
FLOOR OF HUDSON 

New York, 13 July — In a specially constructed diving suit 
built for two, Merydith Smithe, 
cafe society headline girl, and 
Prince Augie Schleswieg of New 
York and the Riviera were united 
today by Bishop Dalton in a 
service televised with the aid of 
the Navy's ultra-new — ■ 

AS the Year of the Jackpot progressed, Breen took melancholy pleasure in adding to the 
data which proved that the curve 
was sagging as predicted. The 
undeclared World War continued 
its bloody, blundering way at 
half a dozen spots around a tortured globe. Breen did not chart 
it; the headlines were there for 
anyone to read. He concentrated 
on the odd facts in the other 
pages of the papers, facts which, 
taken singly, meant nothing, but 
taken together showed a disastrous trend. 

He listed stock market prices, 
rainfall, wheat futures, but the 
"silly season" items were what 
fascinated him. To be sure, some 
humans were always doing silly 
things — but at what point had 
prime damfoolishness become 
commonplace? When, for example, had the zombie-like professional models become accepted 
ideals of American womanhood? 
What were the gradations be


tween National Cancer Week and 
National Athlete's Foot Week? 
On what day had the American 
people finally taken leave of horse 
sense? 

Take transvestism. Male-andfemale dress customs were arbitrary, but they had seemed to be 
deeply rooted in the culture. 
When did the breakdown start? 
With Marlene Dietrich's tailored 
suits? By the late nineteen-forties, 
there was no "male" article of 
clothing that a woman could not 
wear in public — but when had 
men started to slip over the line? 
Should he count the psychological cripples who had made the 
word "drag" a by-word in Greenwich Village and Hollywood long 
before this outbreak? Or were 
they "wild shots" not belonging 
on the curve? Did it start with 
some unknown normal man attending a masquerade and there 
discovering that skirts actually 
were more comfortable and practical than trousers? Or had it 
started with the resurgence of 
Scottish nationalism reflected in 
the wearing of kilts by many 
Scottish- Americans? 

Ask a lemming to state his motives! The outcome was in front 
of him, a news story. Transvestism by draft dodgers had at 
last resulted in a mass arrest in 
Chicago which was to have ended 
in a giant joint trial — only to 
have the deputy prosecutor show

up in a pinafore and defy the 
judge to submit to an examination to determine the judge's true 
■ex. The judge suffered a stroke 
and died and the trial was postponed — postponed forever, in 
Breen's opinion; he doubted that 
this particular blue law would 
ever again be enforced. 

Or the laws about indecent exposure, for that matter. The attempt to limit the Gypsy Rose 
syndrome by ignoring it had 
taken the starch out of enforcement. Now here was a report 
about the AH Souls Community 
Church of Springfield; the pastor 
had reinstituted ceremonial nudity. Probably the first time this 
thousand years. Breen thought, 
aside from some screwball cults 
in Los Angeles. The reverend 
gentleman claimed that the ceremony was identical with the 
"dance of the high priestess" in 
the ancient temple of Karnak. 

Could be, but Breen had private information that the "priestess" had been working the bur* 
lesque and nightclub circuit 
before her present engagement. 
In any case, the holy leader was 
packing them in and had not 
been arrested. 

Two weeks later a hundred and 
nine churches in thirty -three 
states offered equivalent attractions. Breen entered them on his 
curves. 

This queasy oddity seemed to 
THE YEAR OF THE JACKP 



him to have no relation to the 
startling rise in the dissident 
evangelical cults throughout the 
country. These churches were sincere, earnest and poor — but growing, ever since the War. Now they 
were multiplying like yeast. 

It seemed a statistical cinch 
that the United States was about 
to become godstruck again. He 
correlated it with Transcendentalism and the trek of the Latter 
Day Saints. Hmm. yes, it fitted. 
And the curve was pushing to 
ward a crest. 

TRILLIONS in war bonds were 

now falling due ; wartime 
marriages were reflected in the 
swollen peak of the Los Angeles 
school population. The Colorado 
River was at a record low and 
the towers in Lake Mead stood 
high out of the water. But the 
Angclenos committed communal 
suicide by watering lawns as 
usual. The Metropolitan Water 
District commissioners tried to 
stop it. It fell between the stools 
of the police powers of fifty "sovereign" cities. The taps remained 
open, trickling away the life 
blood of the desert paradise. 

The four regular party conventions — Dixiecrats, Regular Republicans, the Regular Regular 
Republicans, and the Democrats 
— attracted scant attention, because ' the Know-Nothings had 
not yet met. The fact that the 

OT 11 



"American Rally," as the KnowNothings preferred to be called, 
claimed not to be a party but 
an educational society did not 
detract from their strength. But 
what was their strength? Their 
beginnings had been So obscure 
that Breen had had to go back 
and dig into the December 1951 
files, yet he had been approached 
twice this very week to join them, 
right inside his own office — once 
by his boss, once by the janitor. 

He hadn't been able to chart 
the Know-Nothings. They gave 
him chills in his spine. He kept 
column-inches on them, found 
that their publicity was shrinking 
while their numbers were obviously zooming. 

Krakatoa blew up on July 18th. 
It provided the first important 
transpacific TV-cast. Its effect 
on sunsets, on solar constant, on 
mean temperature, and on rainfall would not be felt until later 
in the year. 

The San Andreas fault, its 
stresses unrelieved since the Long 
Beach disaster of 1933, continued 
to build up imbalance — an unhealed wound running the full 
length of the West Coast. 

Pelee and Etna erupted. Mauna 
Loa was still quiet. 

Flying Saucers seemed to be 
landing daily in every state. Nobody had exhibited one on the 
ground — or had the Department 
of Defense sat on them? Breen 



was unsatisfied with the off-therecord reports he had been able 
to get; the alcoholic content of 
some of them had been high. But 
the sea serpent on Ventura Beach 
was real; he had seen it. The 
troglodyte in Tennessee he was 
not in a position to verify. 

Thirty-one domestic air crashes 
the last week in July . . . was it 
sabotage, or was it a sagging 
curve on a chart? And that neopolio epidemic that skipped from 
Seattle to New York? Time for a 
big epidemic? Breen's chart said 
it was. But how about bacteriological warfare? Could a chart 
know that a Slav biochemist 
would perfect an efficient virusand-vector at the right time? 

Nonsense! 

But the curves, if they meant 
anything at all. included "free 
will"; they averaged in all the 
individual "wills" of a statistical 
universe — and came out as a 
smooth function. Every morning, 
three million "free wills" flowed 
toward the center of the New 
York megapolis; every evening, 
they flowed out again — all by 
"free will" and on a smooth and 
predictable curve. 

Ask a lemming! Ask all the 
lemmings, dead and alive. Let 
them take a vote on it!

aside and phoned Meade.

"Potty i I was thinking about 
you." 

"Naturally. This is your night 
off." 

"Yes, but another reason, too. 
Potiphar, have you ever taken 
a look at the Great Pyramid?" 

"I haven't even been to Niagara 
Falls. I'm looking for a rich 
woman, so I can travel." 

"I'll let you know when I get 
my first million, but — " 

"That's the first time you've 
proposed to me this week." 

"Shut up. Have you ever 
looked into the prophecies they 
found inside the pyramid?" 

"Look, Meade, that's in the 
same - class with astrology — 
strictly for the squirrels. Grow 
up." 

"Yes, of course. But, Potty, I 
thought you were interested in 
anything odd. This is odd." 

"Oh. Sorry. If it's 'silly season" stuff, let's see it." 

"All right. Am I cooking for 
you tonight?" 

"It's Wednesday, isn't it?" 

"How soon will you get here?" 

He glanced at his watch. "Pick 
you up in eleven minutes." He 
felt his whiskers. "No, twelve and 
a half." 

"I'll be ready. Mrs. Megeath 
says these regular dates mean 
that you are going to marry me." 

"Pay no attention to her. She's 
just a statistic and I'm a wild 
datum," 



*'Oh well, I've got two hundred 
and forty-seven dollars toward 
that million. 'By!" 

Meade's prize to show him was 
the usual Rosicrucian comeon, 
elaborately printed, and including a photograph (retouched, he 
was sure) of the much disputed 
line on the corridor wall which 
was alleged to prophesy, by its 
various discontinuities, the entire 
future. This one had an unusual 
time scale, but the major events 
were all marked on it — the fall 
of Rome, the Norman Invasion, 
the Discovery of America, Napoleon, the World Wars. 

What made it interesting was 
that it suddenly stopped — in 1952. 

"What about it, Potty?" 

"I guess the stonecutter got 
tired. Or got fired. Or they hired 
a new head priest with new 
ideas." He tucked it into his desk. 
"Thanks. I'll think about how to 
list it " 

But he got it out again, applied 
dividers and a magnifying glass. 

"It says here," he announced, 
"that the end comes late in August — unless that's a fly speck." 

"Morning or afternoon? I have 
to know how to dress." 

"Shoes will be worn. All God's 
chilluns got shoes." He put it 
away. 

She was silent for a moment, 
then said, "Potty, isn't it about 
time to jump?" 

"Huh? Girl, don't let that thing

edffect you! That's 'silly season* 
stuff." 

"Yes. But take a look at your 
chart." 

Nevertheless, he took the next 
afternoon Dff, spent it in the reference room of the main library, 
confirmed his opinion of soothsayers. Nostradamus was pretentiously silly, Mother Shippey was 
worse. In any of them you could 
find whatever you looked for.. 

He did find one item in Nostradamus that he liked: "The Oriental shall come forth from his 
seat ... he shall pass through 
the sky, through the waters and 
the snow, and he shall strike each 
one with his weapon." 

That sounded like what the 
Department of Defense expected 
the commies to try to do to the 
Western Allies. 

But it was also a description 
of every invasion that had come 
out of the "heartland" in the 
memory of mankind. 

Nuts! 

When he got home, he found 
himself taking down his father's 
Bible and turning to Revelations. 
He could not find anything he 
Could understand, but he got fascinated by the recurriag use of 
precise numbers. Presently he 
thumbed through the Book. 

His eye lit on: "Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring

He put the Book away, feeling 
humbled, but not cheered. 

HpHE rains started the next 
morning. 

The Master Plumbers elected 
Miss Star Morning "Miss Sanitary Engineering of 1952" on the 
same day that the morticians 
designated her as "The Body I 
Would Like Best to Prepare," and 
her option was dropped by Fragrant Features. 

Congress voted $1.37 to compensate Thomas Jefferson Meeks 
for losses incurred while an 
emergency postman for the 
Christmas rush of 1936, approved 
the appointment of five lieutenant 
generals and one ambassador and

The fire extinguishers in a midwest orphanage turned out to be

Wichita, Kansas, remained

And Poptiphar Breen found 
that he had left his raincoat at 
Meade Barstow's Rooming house. 

He phoned her landlady, but

Mrs. Megeath turned him over to 
Meade. 

"What are you doing home on 
a Friday?" he demanded. 

"The theater manager laid me 
off. Now you'll have to marry 
me." 

"You can't afford me. Meade 
—seriously, baby, what happened?" 

"I was ready to leave the dump 
anyway. For the last six weeks 
the popcorn machine has been 
carrying the place. Today I sat 
through The Lana Turner Story 
twice. Nothing to do." 

"I'll be along." 

"Eleven minutes?" 

"It's raining. Twenty — - with 
luck." 

It was more nearly sixty. Santa 
Monica Boulevard was a navigable stream; Sunset Boulevard 
was a subway jam. When he tried 
to ford the streams leading to 
Mrs, Megeath's house, he found 
that changing tires with the wheel 
wedged against a storm drain presented problems. 

"Potty!" she exclaimed when 
he squished in. "You look like a 
drowned rat." 

He found himself suddenly 
wrapped in a blanket robe belonging to the late Mr. Megeath 
and sipping hot cocoa while Mrs. 
Megeath dried his clothing in the 
kitchen. 

"Meade, I'm 'at liberty' too." 
"Huh? You quit your job?" 



"Not exactly. Old Man Wiley 
and I have been having differences of opinion about my answers for months — too much 
'Jackpot factor' in the figures 1 
give him to turn over to clients. 
Not that I call it that, but he her 
felt th at I was unduly pessi mistic." 

"But you were right!" 

■"Since when has being right endeared a man to his boss? But 
that wasn't why he fired me; ii 
was just the excuse. He wants r. 
man willing to back up the 
Know-Nothing program with scientific double-talk and I wouldn't 
join." He went to the window. 
"It's raining harder." 

"But the Know-Nothings 
haven't got any program." 

"I know that." 

"Potty, you should have joined. 
It doesn't mean anything. I joined 
three months ago." 

"The hell you did!" 

She shrugged. "You pay your 
dollar and you turn up for two 
meetings and they leave you 
alone. It kept my job for another 
three months. What of it?" 

"Well, I'm sorry you did it: 
that's all. Forget it. Meade, the 
water is over the curbs out there." 

"You had better stay here overnight." 

"Mmm ... I don't like to leave 
Entropy parked out in this stuff 
all night. Meade?" 

"Yes, Potty?" 



THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT

"We're both out of jobs. How 
would you like to duck north into 
the Mojave and find a dry spot?" 

"I'd love it. But look, Potty, is 
this a proposal or just a proposition?" 

"Don't pull that 'either-or* 
stuff on me. It's just a suggestion 
for a vacation. Do you want to 
take a chaperone?" 

"No." 

"Then pack a bag." 

"Right away. But pack a bag 
how? Are you trying to tell me 
it's time to jump?" 

He faced her, then looked back 
at the window. 

"I don't know," he said slowly, 
"but this rain might go on quite 
a while. Don't take anything you 
don't have to have — but don't 
leave anything behind you can't 
get along without." 
. He repossessed his clothing 
from Mrs. Megeath while Meade 
was upstairs. She came down 
dressed in slacks and carrying 
two large bags ; under one arm was 
a battered and rakish teddy bear. 

"This is Winnie," she said. 

"Winnie the Pooh?" 

"No, Winnie Churchill. When 
I feel bad, he promises me blood, 
sweat, and tears; then I feel better. You did say to bring anything I couldn't do without, didn't 
you?" She looked at him anxiously. 

"Right." 

He took the bags. Mrs. Me


geath had seemed satisfied with 
his explanation that they were 
going to visit his (mythical) 
aunt in Bakersfield before looking 
for jobs. Nevertheless, she embarrassed him by kissing him 
good-by and telling him to "take 
care of my little girl." 

SANTA Monica Boulevard was 
blocked off from use. While 
stalled in traffic in Beverly Hills, 
he fiddled with the car radio, getting squawks and crackling noises, 
then finally one station nearby: 
" — in effect," a harsh, high, staccato voice was saying, "the Kremlin has given us till sundown to 
get out of town. This is your New 
York reporter, who thinks that 
in days like these every American 
must personally keep his powder 
dry. And now for a word from — " 
Breen switched it off and 
glanced at her face. "Don't 
worry," he said. "They've been 
talking that way for years." 
"You think they are bluffing?" 
"I didn't say that. I said, 'Don't 
worry,' " 

But his own packing, with her 
help, was clearly on a "survival 
kit" basis — canned goods, all his 
warm clothing, a sporting rifle he 
had not fired in over two years, a 
first-aid kit and the contents of 
his medicine chest. He dumped 
the stuff from his desk into a 
carton, shoved it into the back 
seat along with cans and books 



a* 




 



and coats, and covered the 
plunder with all the blankets in 
the house. They went back up 
the rickety stairs for a last check. 

"Potty, where's your chart?** 

"Rolled up on the back seat 
shelf. I guess that's all — hey, wait 
a minute!" He went to a shelf 
over his desk and began taking 
down small, sober-looking magazines. "I dern near left behind my 
file of The Western Astronomer 
and the Proceedings of the Variable Star Association" 

"Why take them?" 

"I must be nearly a year behind on both of them. Now maybe 
I'll have time to read." 

"Hmm . . . Potty, watching you 
read professional journals is not 
my notion of a vacation." 

"Quiet, woman! You took Winnie; I take these." 

She shut up and helped him. 
He cast a longing eye at his 
electric calculator, but decided it 
was too much like the White 
Knight's mousetrap. He could get 
by with his slide rule. 

As the car splashed out into 
the street, she said, "Potty, how 
•re you fixed for cash?" 

"Huh? Okay, I guess.*' 

"I mean, leaving while the 
banks arc closed and everything." 
She held up her purse. "Here's my 
bank. It isn't much, but we can 
use it." 

He smiled and patted her knee. 
"Good gal! I'm sitting on my 

THE YEAR OF THE JACKP 



bank; I started turning everything to cash about the first of 
the year." 

"Oh. I closed out my bank account right after we met." 

"You did? You must have taken 
my maunderings setiously." 

"I always take you seriously.** 

TV! INT Canyon was a five-milean-hour nightmare, with 
visibility limited to the tail lights 
of the truck ahead. When they 
stopped for coffee at Halfway, 
they confirmed what seemed evident: Cajon Pass was closed and 
long-haul traffic for Route 66 
was being detoured through th« 
secondary pass. 

At long, long last they reached 
the Victorville cutoff and lost 
some of the traffic — a good thing, 
because the windshield wiper on 
his side had quit working and 
they were driving by the committee system. 

Just short of Lancaster, she 
said suddenly. "Potty, is this 
buggy equipped with a snorkel?" 

"Nope." 

"Then we had better stop. I 
see a light off the road.*' 

The light was an auto court. 
Meade settled the matter of 
economy versus convention by 
signing the book herself: they 
were placed in one cabin. He saw 
that it had twin beds and let 
the matter ride. Meade went to 
bed with her teddy bear without 

OT 27 



even asking to be kissed good 
night. It was already gray, wet 
dawn. 

They got up in the late afternoon and decided to stay over one 
more night, then push north toward Bakersfield. A high pressure area was alleged to be moving south, crowding the warm, 
wet mass that smothered Southern California. They wanted to 
get into it. Breen had the wiper 
repaired and bought two new 
tires to replace his ruined spare, 
added some camping items to his 
cargo, and bought for Meade a 
.32 automatic, a lady's social purpose gun. 

"What's this for?" she wanted 
to know. 

"Well, you're carrying quite a 
bit of cash." 

"Oh. I thought maybe I was 
to use it to fight you off." 
"Now, Meade — " 
"Never mind. Thanks, Potty." 
They had finished supper and 
were packing the car with their 
afternoon's purchases when the 
quake struck. Five inches of rain 
in twenty-four hours, more than 
three billion tons of mass suddenly loaded on a fault already 
overstrained, all cut loose in 
one subsonic, stomach-twisting 
runtble. 

MflEADE sat down on the wet 
ground very suddenly; 
Biwn stayed upright by dancing 



like a log-roller. When the ground 
quieted down somewhat, thirty 
seconds later, he helped her up. 

"You all right?" 

"My slacks are soaked." She 
added pettishly, "But, Potty, it 
never quakes in wet weather. 
Never. You said so yourself." 

"Keep quiet, can't you?" He 
opened the car door and switched 
on the radio, waited impatiently 
for it to warm up. 

** — your Sunshine Station in 
Riverside, California. Keep tuned 
to this station for the latest developments. As of now it is impossible to tell ' the size of this 
disaster. The Colorado River 
aqueduct is broken: nothing is 
known of the extent of the damage nor how long it will take to 
repair it. So far as we know, the 
Owens River Valley aqueduct 
may be intact, but all persons in 
the Los Angeles area are advised 
to conserve water. My personal 
advice is to stick your washtubs 
out into this rain. 

"I now read from the standard 
disaster instructions, quote: 'Boil 
all water. Remain quietly in your 
homes and do not panic. Stay off 
the highway*. Cooperate with the 
police and render — ' Joe! Catch

der five feet of water. I repeat, 
this is unconfirmed. Here's a 
message from the commanding 
general, March Field: 'Official, 
all military personnel will report — ' " 

Breen switched it off. "Get in 
the car." 

He stopped in the town, managed to buy six five-gallon tins 
and a jeep tank. He filled thern 
with gasoline and packed them 
with blankets in the back seat, 
topping off the mess with a dozen 
cans of oil. Then they started 
rolling. 

"What are we doing, Potiphar?" 

"I want to get west of the valley highway." 

"Any particular place west?" 

"1 think so. We'll see. You work 
the radio, but keep an eye on 
the road, too. That gas back there 
makes me nervous." 

rpHROUGH the town of Mojave and northwest on 466 
into the Tehachapi Mountains — 

Reception was poor in the pass, 
but what Meade could pick up 
confirmed the first impression — 
worse than the quake of '06, worse 
than San Francisco, Managua, 
and Long Beach lumped together. 

When they got down out of 
the mountains, the weather was 
clearing locally; a few stars appeared. Breen swung left off the 
highway and ducked south of 



Bakersfield by the county road, 
reached the Route 99 super-highway just south of Greenfield. It 
was, as he had feared, already 
jammed with refugees. He was 
forced to go along with the flow 
for a couple of miles before he 
could cut west at Greenfield toward Taft. They stopped on the 
western outskirts of the town and 
ate at an all-night joint. 

They were about to climb back 
into the car when there was suddenly "sunrise" due south. The 
rosy light swelled almost instantaneously, filled the sky, and died. 
Where it had been, a red-andpurple pillar of cloud was spreading to a mushroom top. 

Breen stared at it. glanced at 
his watch, then said harshly, "Get 
in the car." 

"Potty! That was—" 

"That used to be Los Angeles. 
Get in the carl" 

He drove silently for several 
minutes. Meade seemed to be in 
a state of shock, unable to speak. 
When the sound reached them, 
he again glanced at his watch. 

"Six minutes and nineteen seconds. That's about right." 

"Potty, we should have brought 
Mrs. Megeath." 

"How was 1 to know?" he said 
angrily. "Anyhow, you can't 
transplant an old tree. If she got 
it, she never knew it." 

"Oh, I hope so!" 

"We're going to have all we 



THE YEAt OP THE JACKPOT 



39 



can do to take care of ourselves. 
Take the flashlight and check the 
map. I want to turn north at Taft 
and over toward the coast." 
"Yes, Potiphar." 

CHE quieted down and did as 
K -' she was told. The radio gave 
nothing, not even the Riverside 
station; the whole broadcast 
range was covered by a curious 
Static, like rain on a window. 

He slowed down as they approached Taft, let her spot the 
turn north onto the state road, 
and turned into it. Almost at 
once a figure jumped out into the 
road in front of them, waved his 
arms violently. Breen tromped on 
the brake. 

The man came up on the left 
side of the car, rapped on the 
window. Breen ran the glass 
down. Then he stared stupidly at 
the gun in the man's left hand. 

"Out of the car," the stranger 
said sharply. "I've got to have it." 

Meade reached across Breen, 
stuck her little lady's gun in the 
man's face and pulled the trigger. 
Breen could feel the flash on his 
own face, never noticed the report. The man looked puzzled, 
with a neat, not -yet-bloody hole 
in his upper lip — then slowly 
sagged away from the car. 

"Drive on!" Meade said in a 
high voice. 

Breen caught his breath. "But 

yOU '* 



"Drive on! Get rolling!" 

They followed the state road 
through Los Padres National 
Forest, stopping once to fill the 
tank from their cans. They turned 
off onto a dirt road. Meade kept 
trying the radio, got San Francisco once, but it was too jammed 
with static to read. Then she got 
Salt Lake City, faint but clear; 

" — since there are no reports of 
anything passing our radar screen, 
the Kansas City bomb must be 
assumed to have been planted 
rather than delivered. This is a 
tentative theory, but — " 

They passed into a deep cut 
and lost the rest. 

When the squawk box again 
came to life, it was a crisp new 
voice : "Air Defense Command, 
coming to you over the combined 
networks. The rumor that Los 
Angeles has been hit by an atom 
bomb is totally unfounded. It is 
true that the western metropolis 
has suffered a severe earthquake 
shock, but that is all. Government officials and the Red Cross 
are on the spot to care for the 
victims, but — and I repeat — there 
has been no atomic bombing. So 
relax and stay in your homes. 
Such wild rumors can damage 
the United States quite as much 
as enemy bombs. Stay off the 
highways and listen for — " 

Breen snapped it off. "Somebody," he said bitterly, "has again 
decided that 'Mama knows best.' 



M 




 




They won't tell us any bed news.** 
"Potiphar," Meade said 
sharply, "that was an atom bomb, 
wasn't it?" 

"It was. And now we don't 
know whether it was just Los Angeles — and Kansas City— or every 
big city in the country. All we 
know is that they are lying to us." 

He concentrated on driving. 
The road was very bad. 

AS it began to get fight, she 
■** said, "Potty, do you know 
where we're going? Are we just 
keeping out of cities?" 

**I think I know. H I'm not 
lost." He stared around them. 



"Nope, it's all right. See that hill 
up forward with the triple gendarmes on its profile?" 
"Gendarmes?" 

"Big rock pillars. That's • sure 
landmark. I'm looking for a 
private road now. It leads to a 
hunting lodge belonging to two of 
my friends — an old ranch house 
actually, but as a ranch it didn't 
pay." 

"They won't mind us using it?** 
He shrugged. "If they show up, 

we*ll ask them. // they show up. 

They lived in Los Angeles." 
The private road had once been 

a poor grade of wagon trail; now it 

was almost impassable. But they

finally topped a hogback from 
which they could see almost to 
the Pacific, then dropped down 
into a sheltered bowl where the 
cabin was. 

"All out, girl. End of the line." 

Meade signed. "It looks heavenly." 

"Think you can rustle breakfast while I unload? There's probably wood in the shed. Or can 
you manage a wood range?" 

"Just try me." 

Two hours later Breen was 
standing on the hogback, smoking 
a cigarette and staring off down 
to the west. He wondered if that 
was a mushroom cloud up San 
Francisco way. Probably his imagination, he decided, in view of 
the distance. Certainly there was 
nothing to be seen to the south. 

Meade came out of the cabin. 
"Potty!" 

"Up here." 

She joined him, took his hand 
and smiled, then snitched his cigarette and took a deep drag. She 
exhaled it and said, "I know it's 
sinful of me, but I feel more 
peaceful than I have in months." 

"I know." 

"Did you see the canned 
goods in that pantry? We could 
pull through a hard winter here." 

"We might have to." 

"I suppose. I wish we had a 
cow." 

"What would you do with c 
cow?" 



"I used to milk four of them 
before I caught the school bus, 
every morning. I can butcher a 
hog, too." 

"I'll try to find you a hog." 

"You do and I'll manage to 
smoke it." She yawned. "I'm suddenly terribly sleepy." 

"So am I. And small wonder." 

"Let's go to bed." 

"Uh, yes. Meade?" 

"Yes, Potty?" 

"We may be here quite a while. 
You know that, don't you?" 
"Yes. Potty." 

"In fact, it might be smart to 
stay put until those curves all 
start turning up again. They 
should, you know." 

"Yes. I had figured that out." 

He hesitated, then went on, 
"Meade, will you marry me?" 

"Yes." She moved up to him. 

After a time he pushed her 
gently away and said, "My dear, 
my very dear — uh — we could 
drive down and find a minister in 
some little town." 

She looked at him steadily. 
"That wouldn't be very bright, 
would it? I mean, nobody knows 
we're here and that's the way we 
want it. Besides, your car might 
not make it back up that road." 

"No, it wouldn't be very 
bright. But I want to do the right 
thing." 

"It's all right, Potty. It's all 
right." • 

"Well, then . . . kneel down 



8 A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



here with me. We'll say them 
together." 

"Yes, Potiphar." She knelt and 
he took her hand. He closed his 
eyes and prayed wordlessly. 

When he opened them he said, 
"What's the matter?" 

"The gravel hurts my knees." 

"We'll stand up, then." 

"No. Look, Potty, why don't 
we just go in the house and say 
them there?" 

"Huh? Hell's bells, woman, we 
might forget to say them entirely. 
Now repeat after me: I, Potiphar, 
take thee. Meade — "

BE CAREFUL; IT MIGHT BE AUNT 
TESSIE. OFF AND CLEAR. UNTIL 
NOON TOMORROW—" 

npHE statistical curves were 
turning up again. There was 
no longer doubt in Breen's mind 
about that. It might not even be 
necessary to stay up here in the 
Sierra Madres through the winter, 
though he rather thought they 
would. It would be silly to be 
mowed down by the tail of a dying epidemic, or be shot by a 
nervous vigilante, when a few 
months' wait would take care of 
everything. 

He was headed out to the hogback to wait for sunset and do 
an hour's reading. He glanced 
at his car as he passed it, thinking 
that he would like to try the radio. 
He suppressed the yen; twothirds of his reserve gasoline was 
gone already just from keeping 
the battery charged for the radio 
—and here it was only December. 
He really ought to cut it down to 
twice a week. But it meant a lot 
to catch the noon bulletin of 
Free America and then twiddle 
the dial a few minutes to see what 
else he could pick up. 



But for the past three days 
Free America had not been on 
the air — solar static maybe, or 
perhaps just a power failure. But 
that rumor that President Brandley had been assassinated — it 
hadn't come from the Free radio 
and it hadn't been denied by 
them, either, which was a good 
sign. 

Still, it worried him. 

And that other story that lost 
Atlantis *had pushed up during 
the quake period and that the 
Azores were now a little continent — almost certainly a hangover of the "silly season" — but 
it would be nice to hear a followup. 

Rather sheepishly, he let his 
feet carry him to the car. It 
wasn't fair to listen when Meade 
wasn't around. He warmed it up. 
slowly spun the dial, once around 
and back. Not a peep at full gain, 
nothing but a terrible amount of 
static. 

Served him right. 

He climbed the hogback, sat 
down on the bench he had 
dragged up there — their "memorial bench," sacred to the 
memory of the time Meade had 
bruised her knees on the gravel 
— sat down and sighed. His lean 
belly was stuffed with venison 
and corn fritters; he lacked only 
tobacco to make him completely 
happy. 

The evening cloud colors were 



0ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



spectacularly beautiful and the 
weather was extremely balmy for 
December; both, he thought, 
caused by volcanic dust, with perhaps an assist from atom bombs. 

Surprising how fast things went 
to pieces when they started to 
skid! And surprising how quickly 
they were going back together, 
judging by the signs. A curve 
reaches trough and then starts 
right back up. 

World War III was the shortest 
big war on record — forty cities 
gone, counting Moscow and the 
other slave cities as well as the 
American ones — and then 
whoosh! neither side fit to fight. 

Of course, the fact that both 
sides had thrown their Sunday 
punch over the North Pole 
through the most freakish arctic 
weather since Peary invented the 
place had a lot to do with it, he 
supposed. 

It was amazing that any of the 
Russian paratroop transports had 
gotten through at all. 

T>REEN sighed and pulled the 
November 1951 copy of the 
Western Astronomer out of his 
pocket. Where was he? Oh, yes, 
Some Notes on the Stability of 
G-Type Stars with Especial Reference to Sol, by Dynkowski, 
Lenin Institute, translated by 
Heinrich Ley, F. R. A.S. 

Good boy, Ski — sound mathematician. Very clever application 




of harmonic series and tightly 
reasoned. 

Breen started to thumb for his 
place when he noticed a footnote 
that he had missed. Dynkowski*s 
own name carried down to it: 
"This monograph was denounced 
by Pravda as 'romantic reactionaryism' shortly after it was published. Professor Dynkowski has 
been unreported since and must 
be presumed to be liquidated." 

The poor geek! Well, he probably would have been atomized 
by now anyway, along with the 
goons who did him in. He wondered if the army really had gotten all the Russki paratroopers. 
He had killed his own quota; if 
he hadn't gotten that doe within 
a quarter-mile of the cabin and 
headed right back, Meade would 
have had a bad time. He had shot 
them in the back and buried them 
beyond the woodpile. 

He settled down to some solid 
pleasure. Dynkowski was a treat. 
Of course, it was old stuff that a 
G-type star, such as the Sun, was 
potentially unstable; a G-O-star 
could explode, slide right off the 
Russell diagram, and end up as a 
white dwarf. But no one before 
Dynkowski had defined the exact 
conditions for such a catastrophe, 
nor had anyone else devised 
mathematical means of diagnosing the instability and describing 
its progress. 

He looked up to rest his eyes 



THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT

from the fine print and saw that 
the Sun was obscured by a thin 
low cloud — one of those unusual 
conditions where the filtering effect is just right to permit a man 
to view the Sun clearly with the 
naked eye. Probably volcanic 
dust in the air, he decided, acting 
almost like smoked glass. 

He looked again. Either he had 
spots before his eyes or that was 
one fancy big Sun spot. He had 
heard of being able to see them 
with the naked eye, but it had 
never happened to him." 

He longed for a telescope. 

He blinked. Yep, it was still 
there, about three o'clock. A big 
spot — no wonder the car radio 
sounded like a Hitler speech. 

HE turned back and continued 
on to the end of the article, 
being anxious to finish before the 
light failed. 

At first his mood was sheerest 
intellectual pleasure at the man's 
tight mathematical reasoning. A 
three per cent imbalance in the 
solar constant — yes, that was 
standard stuff; the Sun would 
nova with that much change. But 
Dynkowski went further. By 
means of a novel mathematical 
operator which he had dubbed 
"yokes," he bracketed the period 
in a star's history when this could 
happen and tied it down with 
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary yokes, showing exactly the 



time of highest probability. 

Beautiful! Dynkowski even assigned dates to the extreme limit 
of his primary yoke, as a good 
statistician should. 

But. as Breen went back and 
reviewed the equations, his mood 
changed from intellectual to personal. Dynkowski was not talking 
about just any G-O star. In the 
latter part, he meant old Sol himself, Breen's personal Sun — the 
big boy out there with the oversize freckle on his face. 

That was one hell of a big 
freckle! It was a hole you could 
chuck Jupiter into and not make 
a splash. He could see it very 
clearly now. 

Everybody talks about "wheo 
the stars grow old and the Sua 
grows cold," but it's an impersonal concept, like one's ows 
death. 

Breen started thinking about it 
very personally. How long would 
it take, from the instant the imbalance was triggered until the 
expanding wave front engulfed 
Earth? The mechanics couldn't 
be solved without a calculation, 
even though they were implicit in 
the equations in front of him. 
Half an hour, for a horseback 
guess, from incitement until the 
Earth went phutt! 

It hit him with gentle melancholy. No more? Never again?

THE red tennis robot scooted desperately across the 
court, its four wide -set 
wheels squealing. For a moment, 
Robert's hard- hit passing shot 
seemed to have scored. Then, at 
the last instant, the robot whipped around its single racketequipped arm. Robert sprawled 
headlong in a futile lunge at the 
return. 

"Game and set to Red Three," 
announced the referee box from 
its high station above the net. 

"Ah, shut up!" growled Robert, 
and flung down his racket for one 
of the white serving robots to 
retrieve. 



"Yes, Robert," agreed the voice. 
"Will Robert continue to play?" 
Interpreting the man's savage 
mumble as a negative, it told his 
opponent, "Return to your stall, 
Red Three!" 

Robert strode off wordlessly toward the house. Reaching the 
hundred - foot - square swimming 
pool, he hesitated uncertainly. 

"Weather's so damned hot," he 
muttered. "Why didn't the oldtime scientists find out how to do 
something about that while there 
were still enough people on Earth 
to manage it?" 

He stripped off his damp clothing and dropped it on the "beach"

of white sand. Behind him sounded the steps of a humanoid serving robot, hastening to pick it up. 
Robert plunged deep into the 
cooling water and let himself float 
lazily to the surface. 

Maybe they did, he thought. / 
could send a robot over to the old 
eity library for information. Still, 
actually doing anything would 
probably take the resources of a 
good many persons — ana* if /sn'f 
so easy to find people now that 
Earth is practically deserted. 

He rolled sideward for a breath 
and began to swim slowly for the 
opposite side of the pool, reflecting upon the curious culture of 
the planet. Although he had accepted this all his life, it really 
was remarkable how the original 
home of the human race had been 
forsaken for fresher worlds among 
the stars. Or was it more remarkable that a few individuals had 
asserted their independence by 
remaining? 

Robert was aware that the decision involved few difficulties, 
considering the wealth of robots 
and other automatic machines. 
He regretted knowing so few humans, though they were really not 
necessary. If not for his hobby of 
televising, he would probably not 
knew any at all. 

"Wonder how far past the old 
city I'd have to go to meet someone in person," he murmured as 
he pulled himself from the pool. 



"Maybe I ought to try accepting 
that televised invitation of the 
other night." 

OEVERAL dark usuform robots 
*^ were smoothing the ~sand on 
this beach under the direction of 
a blue humanoid superviser. 
Watching them idly, Robert estimated that it must be ten years 
since he had seen another human 
face to face. His parents were 
dim memories. He got along very 
well, however, witb robots to 
serve him or to obtain occasional 
information from the automatic 
scanners of the city library that 
had long ago been equipped to 
serve such a purpose. 

"Much better than things were 
in the old days," he told himself 
as he crossed the lawn to his 
sprawling white mansion. "Must 
have been awful before the population declined. Imagine having 
people all around you, having to 
listen to them, see them, and 
argue to make them do what you 
wanted V 

The heel of his bare right foot 
came down heavily on a pebble, 
and he swore without awareness 
of the precise meaning of the ancient phrases. He limped into the 
baths and beckoned a waiting 
robot as he stretched out on a 
rubbing table. 

"Call Blue One!'* he ordered. 

The red robot pushed a button 
on the wall before beginning the 




 



massage. In a few moments, the 
major-domo arrived. 

"Did Robert enjoy the tennis?" 
it inquired politely. 

"I did not!" snapped the man. 
"Red Three won — and by too big 
a score. Have it geared down a 
few feet per second." 

"Yes, Robert." 

"And have the lawn screened 
again for pebbles!" 

As Blue One retired he relaxed, 
and turned his mind to ideas for 
filling the evening. He hoped 
Henry would televise; Robert had 
news for him. 

After a short nap and dinner, 
he took the elevator to his threcstory tower and turned on the 
television robot. Seating himself 
in a comfortable armchair, he directed the machine from one 
channel to another. For some 
time, there was no answer to his 
perfunctory call signals, but one 
of his few acquaintances finally 
came on. 

"Jack here," said a quiet voice 
that Robert had long suspected 
of being disguised by a filter 
microphone. 

"I haven't heard you for some 
weeks," he remarked, eying the 
swirling colors on the screen. 

He disliked Jack for never 
showing his face, but curiosity as 
to what lay behind the mechanical image projected by the other's 
transmitter preserved the acquaintance. 



"I was . . . busy," said the bodiless voice, with a discreet hint of 
a chuckle that Robert found 
chilling. 

He wondered what Jack had 
been up to. He remembered once 
being favored with a televised 
view of Jack's favorite sport — a 
battle between companies of 
robots designed for the purpose, 
horribly reminiscent of human 
conflicts Robert had seen on historical films. 

TTK soon made an excuse to 
■H break off and set the robot to 
scanning Henry's channel. He had 
something to tell the older man, 
who lived only about a hundred 
miles away and was as close to 
be ing his friend as was possible in 
this age of scattered, self-sufficient dwellings. 

"I don't mind talking to him" 
Robert reflected. "At least he 
doesn't overdo this business of 
individual privacy." 

He thought briefly of the disdainful face — seemingly on a distant station — which had merely 
examined him for several minutes 
one night without ever condescending to speak. Recalling his 
rage at this treatment, Robert 
wondered how the ancients had 
managed to get along together 
when there were so many of them. 
They must have had some strict 
code of behavior, he supposed, 
or they never would have bred 



MANNERS OF THE ACL

so enormous a population. 

"I must find out about that 
someday," he decided. "How did 
you act, for instance, if you 
wanted to play tennis but someone else just refused and went to 
eat dinner? Maybe that was why 
the ancients had so many murders." 

He noticed that the robot was 
getting an answer from Henry's 
station, and was pleased. He 
could talk as long as he liked, 
knowing Henry would not resent 
his cutting off any time he became 
bored with the conversation. 

piHE robot focused the image 
* smoothly. "Henry gave the impression of being a small man. 
He was gray and wrinkled compared with Robert, but his black 
eyes were alertly sharp. He smiled 
his greeting and immediately 
launched into a story of one of 
his youthful trips through the 
mountains, from the point at 
which it had been interrupted the 
last time they had talked. 

Robert listened impatiently. 

"Maybe I have some interesting 
news," he remarked as the other 
finished. "I picked up a new station the other night." 

"That reminds me of a time 
■> ' n I was a boy and — ** 

Robert fidgeted while Henry 
described watching his father 
build a spare television set as a 
hobby, with only a minimum of 



robot help. He pounced upon the 
first pause. 

"A new station?" he repeated. 
"Came in very well, too. I can't 
imagine why I never picked it up 
before." * 

"Distant, perhaps?" asked Henry resignedly. 

"No, not very far from me, as 
a matter of fact." 

"You can't always tell, especially with the ocean so close. 
Now that there arc so few people, 
you'd think there'd be land 
enough for all of them; but' a 
good many spend all their lives 
aboard ship-robots." 

"Not this one," said Robert. 
"She even showed me an outside 
view of her home." 

Henry's eyebrows rose. "She? 
A woman?"' 

"Her name is Marcia-Joan." 

"Well, well," said Henry. "Imagine that. Women, as I recall, 
usually do have funny names." 

He gazed thoughtfully at his 
well-kept hands. 

"Did I ever tell you about the 
last woman I knew?" he asked. 
^ "About twenty years ago. We had 
a son, you know, but he grew up 
and wanted his own home and 
robots." 

"Natural enough," Robert commented, somewhat briefly since 
Henry had told him the story before. 

"I often wonder what became 
of him," mused the older man. 



• A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



"That's the trouble with what's 
left of Earth culture— no families 
any more." 

Now he'll tell about the time he 
lived in a crowd of five, thought 
Robert. He, his wife, their boy 
and the visiting couple with the 
fleet of robot helicopters. 

Deciding that Henry could 
reminisce just as well without a 
listener, Robert quietly ordered 
the robot to turn itself off. 

Maybe I wilt make the trip, 
he pondered, on the way downStairs, if only to see what it's tike 
with another person about. 

At about noon of the second 
day after that, he remembered 
that thought with regret. 

The ancient roads, seldom used 
and never repaired, were rough 
and bumpy. Having no flying 
robots, Robert was compelled to 
transport himself and a few mechanical servants in ground vehicles. He had — idiotically, he 
now realized — started with the 
dawn, and was already tired. 

Consequently, he was perhaps 
unduly annoyed when two tiny 
spy-eyes flew down from the hills 
to hover above his caravan on 
whirring little piope^prs. He tried 
to glance up pleasantly while 
their lenses televised pictures to 
their base, but he feared that his 
smile was strained. 

The spy-eyes retired after a 
few minutes. Robert's vehicle, at 
his voiced order, turned onto a 



road leading between two forested hills. 

Right there, he thought four 
hours later, was where I made my 
mistake. I should hdve turned 
back and gone home! 

He stood in the doorway of a 
small cottage of pale blue trimmed with yellow, watching his 
robots unload baggage. They were 
supervised by Blue Two, the spare 
for Blue One. 

A LSO watching, as silently as 
Robert, was a pink-and-blue 
striped robot which had guided 
the caravan from the entrance 
gate to the cottage. After one 
confused protest in a curiously 
high voice, it had not spoken. 

M aybe we shouldn't have 
driven through that flower bed, 
thought Robert. Stilt, the thing 
ought to be versatile enough to 
say so. / wouldn't have such a 
gimerack contraption! 

He looked up as another humanoid robot in similar colors 
approached along the line of 
shrubs separating the main lawns 
from that surrounding the cottage. . 

"Marcia-Joan has finished her 
nap. You may come to the house 
now." 

Robert's jaw hung slack as he 
sought for a reply. His face 
flushed at the idea of a robot's offering fcfm permission to enter the 
house. 



MANNERS OF THE AGE 



43 



Nevertheless, he followed it 
across the wide lawn and between 
banks of gaily blossoming flowers to the main house. Robert was 
not sure which color scheme he 
disliked more, that of the robot or 
the unemphatic pastel tints of the 
house. 

The robot led the way inside 
end along a hall. It pulled back 
a curtain near the other end, revealing a room with furniture for 
human use. Robert stared at the 
girl who sat in an armchair, clad 
in a long robe of soft, pink material. 

She looked a few years younger 
than he. Her hair and eyes were 
also brown, though darker. In 
contrast to Robert's, her smooth 
skin was only lightly tanned, and 
she wore her hair much longer. 
He thought her oval face might 
have been pleasant if not for the 
analytical expression she wore. 

"I am quite human," he said 
in annoyance. "Do you have a 
voice?" 

She rose and walked over to 
him curiously. Robert saw that 
she was several inches shorter 
than he, about the height of one 
of his robots. He condescended to 
bear her scrutiny. 

"You look just as you do on 
the telescreen," she marveled. 

Robert began to wonder if the 
girl were feebleminded. How else 
should he look? 

**I usually swim at this hour," 



he said to change the subject 
"Where is the pool?" 

Marcia-Joan stared at him. 

"Pool of what?" she asked. 

Sensing sarcasm, he scowled. 
"Pool of water, of course ! To 
swim in. What did you think I 
meant — a pool of oil?" 

"I am not acquainted with your 
habits," retorted the girl. 

"None of that stupid wit!" he 
snapped. "Where is the pool?" 

"Don't shout!" shouted the girl. 
Her voice was high and unpleasantly shrill compared with his. 
"I don't have a pool. Who wants 
a swimming pool, anyway?" 

Robert felt his face flushing 
with rage. 

So she won't tell me! he 
thought. All right, I'll find it myself. Everybody has a pool. And 
if she comes in, I'll hold her head 
under for a while! 

Sneering, he turned toward the 
nearest exit from the house. The 
gaily striped robot hastened after 
him. 

THE door failed to swing back 
as it should have at Robert's 
approach. Impatiently, he seized 
the ornamental handle. He felt 
his shoulder grasped by a metal 
hand. 

"Do not use the front doorl" 
said the robot. 

"Let go!" ordered Robert, incensed that any robot should presume to hinder him. 




 



"Only Marcia-Joan uses this 
door," said the robot, ignoring 
Robert's displeasure. 

"I'll use it if I tike!" declared 
Robert, jerking the handle. 

The next moment, he was lifted 
bodily into the air. By the time 
he realized what was happening, 
he was carried, face down, along 
the halt. Too astonished even to 
yell, he caught a glimpse of Marcia-Joan's tiny feet beneath the 
hem of her pink robe as his head 
passed \hc curtained doorway. 

The robot clumped on to the 
door at the rear of the house and 
out into the sunshine. There, it 
released its grip, 

When Robert regained the 
breath knocked out of him by the 
drop, and assured himself that 
no bones were broken, his anger 
returned. 

"I'll find it. wherever it is!" he 
growled, and set out to search 
the grounds. 

About twenty minutes later, 
he was forced to admit that there 
really was no swimming pool. Except for a brook fifty yards away, 
there was only the tiled bathroom 
of the cottage to bathe in. 

"Primitive!" exclaimed Robert, 
eying this. "Manually operated 
water supply, too! I must have 
the robots fix something better 
for tomorrow." 

Since none of his robots was 
equipped with a thermometer, he 
had to draw the bath himself. 




Meanwhile, he gave orders t» 
Blue Two regarding the brook 
and a place to swim. He managed 
to fill the tub without scalding; 
himself mainly because there was 
no hot water. His irritation, by 
the time he had dressed in fresh 
clothes and prepared for another 
talk with his hostess, was still 
lively. 

"Ah, you return?" Marcia-Joaa 
commented from a window above 
the back door. 

"It is time to eat," said Robert 
frankly. 

"You are mistaken." 

He glanced at the sunset, which 
was already fading. 

"It is time," he isjsisted. "I always eat at this hour." 

"Well. I don't." 

Robert leaned back to examine 
her expression more carefully. He 
felt very much the way he had 
the day the water-supply robot 
for his pool had broken down 
and, despite Robert's bellowed 
orders, had flooded a good part 
of the lawn before Blue One had 
disconnected it Some instinct 
warned him. moreover, that bellowing now would be as useless 
as it had been then. 

"What do you do now?" he 
asked. 

"I dress for the evening." 
"And when do you eat?'' 
"After I finish dressing." 
"I'll wait for you," said Robert, 
feeling that that much tolerance 



MANNERS OF THE AGE 



45 



could do no particular harm. 

He encountered the pink-andblue robot in the hall, superintending several plain yellow ones 
bearing dishes and covered platters. Robert followed them to a 
dining room. 

"Marcia-Joan sits there," the 
major-domo informed him as he 
moved toward the only chair at 
the table. 

TJOBERT warily retreated to 
■■'•the opposite side of the table 
and looked for another chair. 
None was visible. 

Of course, he thought, trying 
to be fair. Why should anybody 
in this day have more than one 
chair? Robots don't sit. 

He waited for the major-domo 
to leave, but it did not. The serving robots finished laying out the 
dishes and retired to posts along 
the wall. Finally, Robert decided 
that he would have to make his 
status clear or risk going hungry. 

// / sit down somewhere, he 
decided, it may recognize me as 
human. What a stupid machine 
to have! 

He started around the end of 
the table again, but the striped 
robot moved to intercept him. 
Robert stopped. 

"Oh, well," he sighed, sitting 
side wise on a corner of the table. 

The robot hesitated, made one 
or two false starts in different directions, then halted. The situa


tion had apparently not been included among its memory tapes. 
Robert grinned and lifted the 

cover of the nearest platter. 

He managed to eat, despite his 
ungraceful position and what he 
considered the scarcity of the 
food. Just as he finished the last 
dish, he heard footsteps in the 
hall. 

Marcia-Joan had dressed in a 
fiesh robe, of crimson. Its thinner 
material was gathered at the 
waist by clasps of gleaming gold. 
The arrangement emphasized 
bodily contours Robert had previously seen only in historical 
films. 

He became aware that she was 
regarding him with much the 
same suggestion of helpless dismay as the major-domo. 

"Why. you've eaten it all!" she 
exclaimed. 

"All?" snorted Robert. "There 
was hardly any food!" 

Marcia-Joan walked slowly 
around the table, staring at the 
empty dishes. 

"A few bits of raw vegetables 
and the tiniest portion of proteinconcentrate I ever saw!" Robert 
continued. ""Do you call that a 
dinner to serve a guest?" 

"And I especially ordered two 
portions — " 

"Two?" Robert repeated in astonishment. "You must visit me 
sometime. I'll show you — " 

"What's the matter with my 




 



food?" interrupted the girl! "I follow the best diet advice my robots 
could find in the city library.** 

"They should have looked for 
human diets, not song-birds'.*' 

He lifted a cover in hopes of 
finding some overlooked morsel, 
but the platter was bare. 

"No wonder you act so strangely,", he said. "You must be sufj fermg from malnutrition. I don't 
wonder with a skimpy diet like 
this." 

"It's very healthful," insisted 
Marcia-Joan. "The old film said 
it was good for the figure, too.** 

"Not interested," grunted Robert. "I'm satisfied as I am." 

"Oh, yes? You look gawky to 
me." • 

"You don't," retorted Robert, 
examining her disdainfully. "You 
are short and stubby and too 
plump." 

"Plump?" 

"Worse, you're actually fat in 
lots of places I'm not." 

"At least not between the ears!" 

Robert blinked. 

"Wh-wh-WHAT?" 

"And besides," she stormed on, 
"those robots you brought are 
painted the most repulsive 
colors!" 

TJOBERT closed his mouth and 
silently sought the connection. 

Robots? he thought. Not fat, 
but repulsive colors, she said. 



What haatihat to do with food? 
The woman seems incapable ol 
togic. 

"And furthermore," MarciaJoan was saying, "I'm not sure I 
care for the looks of you! Lulu, 
put him out!" 

"Who's Lulu?" demanded Robert. 

Then, as the major-domo 
moved forward, he understood. 

"What a silly name for a robot!" he exclaimed. 

"I suppose you'd call it Robert. 
Will you go now, or shall I call 
more robots?" 

""I am not a fool," said Robert 
haughtily. "I shall go. Thank you 
for the disgusting dinner." 

"Do not use the front door,** 
said the robot. "Only MarciaJoan uses that. AH robots use 
other doors." 

Robert growled, but walked 
down the hall to the back door. 
As this swung open to permit his 
passage, he halted. 

"It's dark out there now," he 
complained over his shoulder. 
"Don't you have any lights on 
your grounds? Do you want me 
to trip over something?" 

"Of course I have ground 
lights | w shrilled Marcia-Joan. 
"Ill show you — not that I care 
if you trip or not." 

A moment later, lights concealed among the trees glowed 
into life. Robert walked outside 
and turned toward the cottage.

/ should have asked her what 
the colors of my robots had to do 
with it, he thought, and turned 
back to re-enter. 

He walked right into the closed 
door, which failed to open before 
him, though it had operated 
smoothly a moment ago. 

"Robots not admitted after 
dark," a mechanical voice informed him. "Return to your stall 
in the shed." 

"Whom do you think you're 
talking to?" demanded Robert. 
"I'm not one of your robots!" 

There was a pause. 

"Is it Marcia-Joan?" asked the 
Toice-box, after considerable buzzing and whirring. 

"No, I'm Robert." 
^ There was another pause while 
the mechanism laboriously shifted back to its other speech tape. 
Then: "Robots not admitted after 
dark. Return to your stall in the 
■hed." 

Robert slowly raised both 
hands to his temples. Lingeringly, 
he dragged them down over his 
cheeks and under his chin until 
at last the fingers interlaced over 
his tight lips. After a moment, he 
let out his breath between his 
fingers and dropped his hands to 
his sides. 

He raised one foot to kick, but 
decided that the door looked too 
hard. 

He walked away between the 
beds of flowers, grumbling. 



TJEACHING the vicinity of the 
cottage, he parted the tall 
shrubs bordering its grounds and 
looked through carefully before 
proceeding. Pleased at the gleam 
of water, he called Blue Two. 

"Good enough! Put the other 
robots away for the night. They 
can trim the edges tomorrow." 

He started into the cottage, but 
his major-domo warned, "Someone comes." 

Robert looked around. Through 
thin portions of the shrubbery, he 
caught a glimpse of MarciaJoan's crimson robe, nearly black 
in the diffused glow of the lights 
illuminating the grounds. 

"Robert!" called the girl angrily. "What are your robots doing? I saw them from my upstairs 
window — " 

"Wait there!" exclaimed Robert 
as she reached the shrubs. 

"What? Are you trying to tell 
me where I can go or not go? I— 

Yir 

The shriek was followed by a 
tremendous splash. Robert stepped forward in time to be spattered by part of the flying spray. 
It was cold. 

Naturally, being drawn from 
the brook, he reflected. Oh, well, 
the sun will warm it tomorrow. 

There was a frenzy of thrashing and splashing in the dimly 
lighted water at his feet, accompanied by coughs and spluttering 
demands that he "do something!"

MANNERS OF THE AOI 



Robert reached down with one 
hand, caught his hostess by the 
wrist, and heaved her up to solid 
ground. 

"My robots are digging you a 
little swimming hole," he told her. 
"They brought the water from 
the brook by a trench. You can 
finish it with concrete or plastics 
later; it's only fifteen by thirty 
feet." 

He expected some sort of acknowledgment of his efforts, and 
peered at her through the gloom 
when none was forthcoming. He 
thus caught a glimpse of the fullswinging slap aimed at his face. 
He tried to duck. 

There was another splash, followed by more floundering about. 

"Reach up," said Robert patiently, "and I'll pull you out 
again. I didn't expect you to like 
it this much." 

Marcia-Joan scrambled up the 
bank, tugged viciously at her sodden robe, and headed for the 
nearest pathway without replying. Robert followed along. 

As they passed under one of 
the lights, he noticed that the red 
reflections of the wet material, 
where it clung snugly to the girl's 
body, were almost the color of 
some of his robots. 

The tennis robot, he thought, 
and the moving targets tor archery — in /acf, all the sporting 
equipment. 

"You talk about food for the 



figure," he remarked lightly. "You 
shoufd see yourself now! It's 
really funny, the way — '* 

He stopped. Some strange emotion stifled his impulse to laugh at 
the way the robe clung. 

Instead, he lengthened his 
stride, but he was still a few feet 
behind when she charged through 
the front entrance of the house. 
The door, having opened automatically for her, started to swing 
closed. Robert sprang forward to 
catch it. 

"Wait a minute!" he cried. 

Marcia-Joan snapped something that sounded like "Get 
out ! " over her shoulder, and 
squished off toward the stairs. As 
Robert started through the door 
to follow, the striped robot 
hastened toward him from its 
post in the hall. 

"Do not use the front door!" it' 
warned him. 

"Out of my way!" growled 
Robert. 

The robot reached out t» enforce the command. Robert seized 
it by the forearm and put all his 
weight into a sudden tug. The 
machine tottered off balance. Re* 
leasing his grip, he sent it staggering out the door with a quick 
shove . 

A HASTY glance showed Marcia-Joan flapping wetly up 
the last steps. Robert turned to 
face the. robot.

"Do not use that door!" he 
quoted vindictively, and the robot halted its rush indecisively. 
"Only Marcia-Joan uses it," 

The major-domo hesitated. 
After a moment, it strode off 
around the corner of the house. 
First darting one more look at the 
stairs, Robert thrust his head outside and shouted: "Blue Two!" 

He held the door open while he 
waited. There was an answer from 
the shrubbery. Presently, his own 
supervisor hurried up. 

"Fetch the emergency toolbox!" 
Robert ordered. "And bring a 
couple of others with you." 

"Naturally, Robert. I would 
not carry it myself." 

A moment after the robot had 
departed on the errand, heavy 
steps sounded at the rear of the 
hall. Marcia- Joan's robot had 
dealt with the mechanism of the 
back door. 

Robert eyed the metal mask as 
the robot walked up to him. He 
found the color contrast less 
pleasant than ever. 

"I am not using the door," he 
said hastily. "I am merely holding it open." 

"Do you intend to use it?" 

"I haven't decided." 

"I shall carry you out back," 
the robot decided for him. 

"No, you don't!" exclaimed 
Robert, leaping backward. 

The door immediately began to 
swing shut as he passed through. 



Cursing, he lunged forward. The 
robot reached for him. 

This time, Robert missed his 
grip. Before he could duck away, 
his wrist was trapped in a metal 
grasp. 

The door will close, he despaired. They'll be too late. 

Then, suddenly, he felt the portal drawn back and heard Blue 
Two speak. 

"What does Robert wish?" 

"Throw this heap out the 
door!" gasped Robert. 

Amid a trampling of many feet, 
the major-domo was raised bodily by Blue Two and another 
pair of Robert's machines and 
hustled outside. Since the grip on 
Robert's wrist was not relaxed, 
he involuntarily accompanied the 
rush of metal bodies. 

"Catch the door!" he called to 
Blue Two. 

When the latter sprang to obey, 
the other two took the action as a 
signal to drop their burden. The 
pink-and-blue robot landed full 
length with a jingling crash. Robert was free. 

With the robots, he made for 
the entrance. Hearing footsteps 
behind him as the major-domo 
regained its feet, he slipped 
hastily inside. 

"Pick up that toolbox !" he 
snapped. 'When that robot stops 
in the doorway, knock its head 
off!" 

Turning, he held up a finger.

"Do not use the front door!" 

The major-domo hesitated. 

The heavy toolbox in the grip 
of Blue Two descended with a 
thud. The pink-and-blue robot 
landed on the ground a yard or 
two outside the door as if dropped 
from the second floor. It bounced 
once, emitted a few sparks and 
pungent wisps of smoke, lay still. 

"Never mind, that's good 
enough," said Robert as Blue Two 
stepped forward. "One of the 
others can drag it off to the repair 
shop. Have the toolbox brought 
with us." 

"What does Robert wish now?" 



inquired Blue Two, trailing the 
man toward the stairway. 

"I'm going upstairs," said Robert. "And I intend to be prepared 
if any more doors are closed 
against me!" 

He started up, the measured 
treads of his own robots sounding 
reassuringly behind him . . . , 

IT was about a week later that 
Robert sat relaxed in the armchair before his own telescreen, 
facing Henry's wizened visage. 

The elder man clucked sympathetically as he re-examined the 
scratches on Robert's face and the 
bruise under his right eye.

"And so you left there in the 
morning?" 

"I certainly did!" declared 
Robert. "We registered a marriage record at the city library by 
television, of course, but I don't 
care if I never see her again. She 
needn't even tell me about the 
child, if any. I simply can't stand 
(hat girl!" 

"Now, now," Henry said. 

"I mean it! Absolutely no consideration for my wishes. Everything in the house was run to suit 
her convenience." 

"After all," Henry pointed out, 
"it is her house." 

Robert glared. "What has that 
to do with it? 1 don't think I was 
as unreasonable as she said in 
smashing that robot. The thing 
just wouldn't let me alone!" 

"I guess," Henry suggested, "it 
was conditioned to obey MarciaJoan, not you." 

"Well, that shows you! Whose 
orders are to count, anyway? 
When 1 tell a robot to do something, I expect it done. How 
would you like to find robots trying to boss you around?" 

"Ar* you talking about robots,** 
asked Henry, "or the girl?" 

"Same thing, isn't it? Or it 
would be if I'd decided to bring 
her home with me." 

"Conflict of desires," murmured 
Henry. 

"Exactly ! It's maddening to 
have a perfectly logical action in


terfered with because there's another person present to insist— 
insist, mind you — on having her 
way." 

"And for twenty-odd years, 
you've had your own way in 
every tiny thing." 

Somewhere in the back of Robert's mind lurked a feeling that 
Henry sounded slightly sarcastic. 

"Well, why shouldn't I?" he demanded. "I noticed that in every 
disagreement, my view was the 
right one." 

"It was?" 

"Of course it was! What did 
you mean by that tone?" 

"Nothing . . ." Henry seemed 
lost in thought. "I was just wondering how many 'right* views are 
left on this* planet. There must be 
quite a few, all different, even if 
we have picked up only a few by 
television. An interesting facet of 
our peculiar culture — every individual omnipotent and omniscient, within his own sphere.*" 

Robert regarded him with indignant incredulity. 

"You don't seem to understand 
my point," he began again. "I told 
her we ought to come to my 
house, where things are better 
arranged, and she simply refused.

MANNIRS OF THE AGE 




ASTRONOMY books and 
f^L science fiction stories are, 
J_ I have come to realize, 
unfair to satellites. Astronomy 
books are in the habit of merely 
listing them, while stories usually 
treat them as mete props. "One 



expedition was sent to the single 
barren satellite," or, "The ship 
was in hiding on the third satellite, a useless hunk of rock, but 
it made radar detection impossible." 

Such slighting treatment may 





 



be expedient, but it is hardly polite. Satellites, or at least some of 
them, do have as much individuality as the planets to which they 
belong. And they have their mysteries too. 

Moons come in all sizes, from 
the estimated five mile diameter 
of Deimos, the smaller moon ©f 
Mars, to the 3550 mile diameter 
of Titan, the largest moon in the 
Solar System. Titan is larger 
than the smallest planet of our 
system, Mercury (3100 miles in 
diameter) and so are two of 
Jupiter's moons, namely III 
(Ganymede) and IV (Callisto). 
Neptune's larger moon Triton 
falls short of Mercury by just a 
few score miles. And fourteen of 
all the moons, roughly half their 
total number, are larger than the 
largest of the planetary worlds of 
the so-called asteroid belt. 

The largest of the planetoids, as 
they should be called since aster 
is Greek for "star" and they are 
not little stars but little planets, 
is Ceres with a diameter of 
around 480 miles. The next one 
in size, Pallas, measures very 
slightly over 300 miles in diameter, while Vesta, the third 
largest of the planetoids, has a 
diameter of only about 240 miJes. 

So it is not a question of size. 
A satellite is a satellite because 
it moves, around a planet. 

Our own moon is one of the 
largest, ranking sixth in absolute 



size among the satellites. But it 
is the largest by far in relation 
to the size of its planet. Its diameter of 2160 miles is more than 
one-fourth of that of Earth 
(7900 miles). No other satellite is 
anywhere near as large in relation to the size of its planet. Next 
largest relative size is that of Neptune's larger moon Triton, whose 
diameter of 3000 miles is roughly 
10 per cent of Neptune's 31,000 
miles, while Titan's impressive 
3550 miles are just about five per 
cent of Saturn's 71,500 miles. 

Looking at these figures, it becomes understandable why some 
astronomers in the past preferred 
to speak about Earth and its 
moon as a double planet. 

If Earth has relatively the largest moon, Mars has the smallest, 
at least in absolute size. It is 
fairly well known that Dean Jonathan Swift, in the story in which 
his long-suffering Captain Lemuel 
Gulliver visits the flying island of 
Laputa, "prophesied" the existence of the two moons of Mars 
one and a half centuries before 
they were actually discovered. It 
was a mere guess, based on the 
"theory" that Mercury was the 
moon of the Sun. that Venus had 
no moon and Earth one, so that 
Mars had to have two. But it is 
less well known how closely Swift 
guessed. His Laputan astronomers, he wrote, had discovered 
the two satellites revolving around

Mars, "whereof the innermost is 
distant from the Center of the 
Primary Planet exactly three of 
its Diameters, and the outermost, 
five; the former revolves in the 
space of ten hours, the latter in 
twenty-one and a half." 

Now look at the diagram 
(Fig. 1) which contains the correct values, Since a Martian day 
lasts 24 hours and 37 minutes, 
Phobos, the inner moon, has a 
period of revolution which is 
shorter than the period of rotation of its planet. Even though it 
moves in the same direction as 
the outer moon, Deimos. and 
most of the other moons of the 
Solar System, it will seem to go 
the wrong way when viewed from 
the surface of the planet. It will 
rise in the west and set in the 
cast twice every day, going 
through its phases as it does so. 
Although small, it is so close to 
the planet that it will appear 



about one-third as large as our 
moon does to us. Deimos, on the 
other hand> will rise in the east, 
but needs almost three Martian 
days to reach the opposite horizon. During this interval it will 
run through its phases twice, but 
Earthmen on Mars would need 
binoculars to see the phases. 

.One of the things we can*t tell 
from Earth is whether Deimos is 
actually spherical. It probably is, 
but it does not have to be. The 
sphericity of celestial bodies 1 is 
due to the fact that gravitation 
is a mass force while the tensile 
strength of a material is a molecular force. Since molecular forces , 
do not grow with mass, and gravity does, you probably couldn't 
have a thirty-mile diameter mass 
of any thing that is not pretty 
spherical. Deimos, however, measures only five miles in diameter 
and, while it is apt to be reasonably spherical, a noticeable 
deviation from the "pure shape" 
is possible. 

The probability is very high 
that Mars' two moons were once 
members of the asteroid belt. Of 
the 1300 or so planetoids now 
known, most move in the belt 
between Mars and Jupiter. There 
is no visible or imaginable reason 
why multitudes of tiny planets 
should have formed at that particular distance from the Sun, so 
the customary assumption is that 
the planetoids once formed a

single planet, which was destroyed by the vicinity of mighty 
Jupiter at the outer edge of the 
belt. The planetoids in the belt 
(by tradition, they have all been 
given female names) move with 
orbital velocities varying from 
around 14.5 mites per second at 
the inner edge to about 8.5 miles 
per second at the outer edge. 
Since Mars itself moves with an 
orbital velocity of 15 miles per 
second, which is more important 
than its feeble gravity, it could 
have captured its two moons 
from the belt. It may have captured more in the course of geological time, but these others, 
instead of becoming moons, probably crashed on the planet. 

In addition to the planetoids 
in the belt, there are some which 
travel around the Sun outside the 
belt — they were given male names 
to distinguish them from the wellbehaved members. Most of them 
cross the orbit of at least one of 
the larger planets. Their own orbits, therefore, are highly eccen


tric ; that is to say, elongated 
ellipses. A concomitant of such 
an orbit is that the orbital velocity varies considerably. Such 
a planetoid may move four timet 
as fast when near the Sun, at perihelion, than it does when farthest 
from the Sun, at aphelion. 

This means that the male planetoids that cross the orbit ' of 
Earth are considerably faster at 
Earth's distance from the Sun 
than Earth itself. We have an 
actual example on record, the 
close approach of the planetoid 
Adonis in early February 1936, 
When crossing the orbit of Earth, 
its velocity was 23 miles per second relative to the Sun and 16.8 
miles per second relative to Earth. 
The actual distance at the instant 
of closest approach was roughly 
twice as far as our moon. At another time Adonis may come 
closer to Earth than the Moon. 
But even at the closest i>ossible 
approach its relative velocity 
would have to be just one mile 
per second, instead of the actual

16.8, if a "capture" were to be 
accomplished. At the orbit of 
Venus, the planetoid velocities 
are even higher, which explains 
why neither Earth nor Venus ever 
succeeded in capturing one. 

The planet at the outer edge 
of the belt is not much slower 
than the nearer planetoids, and, 
m addition, it happens to be the 
most massive of all planets — 
Jupiter. Even if we were not able 
to see and photograph them, we 
could be certain that Jupiter 
should have a number of moons 
which are captured planetoids. 

Our own moon obviously is not 



a captured planetoid, but a body 
which formed near Earth from 
the same cosmic material and in 
the same manner as the planets. 
This would be a far better statement if one could also say just 
how Earth and the other planets 
did form. Most of the recent ideas 
on this difficult problem work 
with the gradual aggregation of 
small particles of cosmic material, 
aided by turbulence in a rotating 
dust cloud. Whatever the precise 
mechanism of planet formation 
may have been, the larger moons 
probably formed in the same 
manner, presumably beginning

one of the original planets. 

As for Jupiter's moons, twelve 
by latest count, they seem to belong to both types. The large ones 
are evidently original satellite 
bodies; of the small ones, at least 
some behave as one would expect 
of captured planetoids. The moon 
closest to Jupiter (called J-V because they are numbered not in 
the order of distance from the 
planet, but in the order of dis

covery) may be a captured body, 
too, even though it is fairly large. 
Any moon which needs only two> 
hours more for one complete revolution around its primary than 
the planet needs for one rotation 
is at least under suspicion. 

The four large moons are big 
and brilliant enough to be easily 
visible with a good pair of binoculars. With a good astronomical 
telescope it is even possible to 
distinguish some faint surface 
markings. J-l (or Io) shows a 
very wide equatorial belt which 
is definitely brighter than both 
polar areas. J -I I (or Europa) 
was always thought to be featureless until E. M. Antoniadi, some 
25 years ago, saw an extensive 
dusky spot in the central portion 
of the disk. J-III (or Ganymede) 
has one large and at least one 
smaller darkish spot and a round 
white area near its southern pole. 
If that actually is a polar cap, 
it would not be frozen water but 
a frozen gas. Though I have never 
seen frozen methane, I presume 
that it forms crystals when freezing so that the general effect 
would be about the same as snow. 

J-IV (or Callisto) does not 
have any markings, but presents 
color changes at rare intervals. 
Normally its disk is reddishyellow. It has been seen perfectly 
black, however, as if it had suddenly developed a light -absorbing 
atmosphere! Before anybody 

Iff 




starts a story that an expedition 
from Arcturus-lV has established 
an outpost on Callisto and is gencrating an absorbing screen to get 
the radiant energy, I have to advise him to think up a different 
explanation for Plato. Plato is 
a large crater on our own moon 
which has been black quite often. 
But Plato becomes black just 
when the Lunar day has progressed to about its middle, which 
is the time when one would want 
to keep radiant energy our, instead of absorbing it. 

No trace of an atmosphere has 
been found otherwise on any of 
Jupiter's moons. And in all the 
cases where their rotation could 
be established at all, it was found 
to be the same as their revolution 
around their primary. Like our 
moon, Jupiter's satellites always 
turn the same side toward their 
master. 

If the picture of the five inner 
moons is a well-ordered cosmos, 
that of the outer moons is one 
of complete confusion (see Fig. 
3). Not only do their orbits intersect and cross, they are also 
at all possible angles to the plane 
of Jupiter's equator. Furthermore, 
No. VIII, No. IX and No. XI 
are 'Vetrograde" — they move in 
the opposite direction than the 
Solar System. This fact might be 
considered favorable to the captured theory ; a planet of the 
mass of Jupiter could force a 



• AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



planetoid into an orbit which 
points either way. As for No. XII, 
discovered in 1951 by Dr. Seth 
B. Nicholson, we don't know yet 
in which direction it moves. But 
it is so small — an estimated 15 
miles in diameter — that it probably is a captured planetoid, too. 
In" fact, if we were nearer Jupiter, 
we would probably find a few 
dozen additional moonlets, in all 
kinds of orbits, each smaller than 
ten miles in diameter and every 
one a captured planetoid. 

Navigating in the Jupiter system is apt to be quite hazardous; 
it may be as bad as going through 
the asteroid belt itself. In one 
respect worse, for ships could 
avoid the asteroid belt quite easily 
by traversing it "above" or "below," north or south of the ecliptic, like crossing a busy highway 
on a fjridge. But if they wanted 
to go to one of the large moons 
of Jupiter, they'd have to head 
into the medley of moonlets we 
don't even see from here. Incidentally, a ship which wanted to 
land on a retrograde satellite 
would not have any special 
troubles. It only would have 
to catch a retrograde satellite 
on the "wrong" side of the 
planet, the opposite side from 
which the captain would catch a 
"direct" moon. 

In contrast to Jupiter's complex 
and confused system of satellites, 
the nine moons of Saturn are so 



orderly that it was not even necessary to draw a diagram. 

Except for Phoebe (200 miles) 
they are all quite massive and, as 
has been mentioned before. Titan 
is the biggest of all the satellites 
in the Solar System. It is so large 
that it has an atmosphere, the 
only satellite capable of holding 
one. It is the same as the composition of Saturn's own atmosphere, methane (CH«) and ammonia. Brownish markings have 
been seen on Titan on occasion, 
but their nature is unknown. 

Every moon from Mimas to 
Hyperion is lined up to please 
a drill sergeant. Hyperion does 
have a slightly eccentric orbit, to 
about the same extent as that of 
the planet Mars, but is still in 
line, lapetus, though not in line 
as regards inclination, has a 
nearly circular orbit. Only Phoebe 
is a black sheep, retrograde and 
with a fairly eccentric orbit. 
Phoebe might be a captured planetoid. One male planetoid. Hidalgo, is known to break out of 
the belt, cross the orbit of Jupiter 
and come close to that of Saturn. 
The biggest puzzle in this orderly 
system is probably lapetus. One 
side of it is five times as bright 
as the other! Don't ask why; we 
just know the fact. 

The satellite system of Uranus 
became "news" in 1948 because

four which had been known for 
over a century. Miranda, with 
an estimated diameter of 150 
miles, is closest to the planet 
(80,800 miles) and gets around it 
once in 30 hours. Ariel, the next 
one out, at 119,100 miles, has a 
diameter of 600 miles and a period of 2 days, 12 hours and 
291/^ minutes. Umbriel, the next 
satellite at 165.900 miles, measures 400 miles in diameter and 
has a period of 4 days, 3 hours 
and 27 \4 minutes. Titania, at 
272,000 miles, measures 1000 
miles in diameter and has a period of 8 days, 16 hours and 56'/£ 
minutes. Oberon, finally, farthest 
out at 364,000 miles and almost 
as large as Titania (est. diam. 900 
mi.), needs 13 days, 11 hours and 
7 minutes for one complete revolution. 

Uranus' system is just as orderly as that of Saturn, but has 
a peculiar twist — literally. The 
axes of most planets are reasonably 
vertical in relation to their orbits, 
like spinning tops, Jupiter's almost upright with a tilt of only 
3° 7', Earth canted a good deal 
at 231/2° tilt. Mars at 25° 10' and 
so on. But Uranus 1 axis, tilted 
98° degrees from the vertical, 
practically points at the Sun on 
occasion! Its five moons, however, 
have maintained the customary 
orbital plane of satellites, roughly 
the equatorial plane of their primaries, and are, therefore, tilted 



by a little more than a right angle, 
too. Since one cannot imagine a 
force which could do this to a 
finished planetary system, the 
most logical assumption is that 
there was a major eddy of that 
tilt in the cosmic dust cloud before it condensed. 

Pluto being moonless, the most 
distant satellites are in the Neptune system. For a long time only 
the large moon Triton was known 
and its main feature was that it 
was retrograde, tilted some forty 
degrees against the orbit of the 
planet. For an almost equally 
long time it was believed that 
the planet itself rotated in the 
"wrong" direction (the "right" 
direction in our solar system is 
counter-clockwise 1 when seen from 
the celestial north pole). Astronomers speculated on the problem 
of what could flop both % planet 
and its satellite over almost completely. But then it turned out 
that Neptune's rotation is normal 
and we are simply dealing with 
the largest of all retrograde 
moons. In 1949 Dr. Gerard P. 
Kuiper. the discoverer of Miranda, found a second small satellite of Neptune which is not 
retrograde. But that small satellite, Nereid, with a mass only 
slightly above 10 per cent of that 
of Triton, has an elongated orbit 
of a type considered characteristic 
of comets! 

Such an orbit, combined with 




 



so low a mass, should spell "capture" in large letters. Now the 
idea of capture has worked out 
neatly elsewhere. Mars and Jupiter, close to the belt, could and 
did. Saturn still had a chance and 
probably did. Uranus no longer 
had a chance and did not. Neptune, of course, has less of a 
chance than any other planet. 
Then what did it capture? And 
from where?

ANY QUESTIONS? 

Is there any connection between the names of the planet 
Uranus and the element uranium? 

Yes, hul that's only one-third 
of the answer. When the scientist Klaprolh came lo the conclusion that pitchblende contained a new and u nk now n 
element, he named it uruiiium 
in honor of the recent discovery 
of Uranus hy Heraehel. Modern 
physicists have continued this 
tradition and named the elements heyond uranium after the 
planets beyond Uranus, hence 
nepltmitim and plu Ionium. 

How high is our atmosphere 
and how high have we gone? * 

The altitude records as of 
December let, 1951, are: 



manned balloon, Explorer If, 
72,400 feel ; unmanned balloon, 
] 25,000 feet ; manned rocket 
airplane, Skyrocket, estimated 
78,000 feet (correct value is 
classified) ; unmanned single 
stage rocket, Viking Vli, 
135 miles; two-stage rocket, 
Bumper I, 250 miles. The 
height of the atmosphere depends on definition. For practical purposes, everything above 
50 miles is a vacuum. 

You have used the term "living 
fossil" in your books and assumed 
the reader knew what you meant. 
I don't; sounds like a paradox to 
me. Would you explain the term? 

A living fossil is an animal 
or plant species known both 
living and fossil, or a living 
form closely resembling a fossil 
type. There are mauy examples: horseshoe crahs, sharks, 
ferns, etc. Whatever its form, 
experts are delighted to have 
it still around. 

How would an atomic drive 
for a large, rocket or spaceship 
work? 

You'll fiml the answer in any 
textbook on the subject published in 1975 and after. 

I wish 1 had a copy of one 
myself.

THE silver needle moved 
with fantastic speed, 
slowed when it neared the 
air shell around Earth, then 
glided noiselessly through the 
atmosphere. It gently settled to 
the ground near a wood and remained silent and still for a long 
time, a lifeless, cylindrical, 
streamlined silver object eight 
feet long and three feet in diameter. 

Eventually the cap end opened 
and a creature of bright blue 
metal slid from its interior and 
stood upright. The figure was that 
of a man, except that it was not 
human. He stood in the pasture 
next to the wood, looking around. 
Once the sound of a bird made 
him turn his shiny blue head toward the wood. His eyes began 
glowing.

History is fitted with invincible conquerors. 
This one from space was genuinely omnipotent, 
but that never keeps humanity from resisting!

An identical sound came from 
his mouth, an unchangeable orifice in his face below his nose. 
He tuned in the thoughts of the 
bird, but his mind encountered 
little except an awareness of a 
life of low order. 

The humanoid bent to the ship, 
withdrew a small metal box, carried it to a catalpa tree at the 
edge of the wood and, after an 
adjustment of several levers and 
knobs, dug a hole and buried it. 
He contemplated it for a moment, 
then turned and walked toward 
a road. 

He was halfway to the road 
when his ship burst into a dazzling white light. When it was 
over, all that was left was a white 
powder that was already beginning to be dispersed by a slight 
breeze. 



The humanoid did not bother 
to look back. 

T> RENT WOOD would have 
been just like any other average community of 10,000 in 
northern Illinois had it not been 
for Presser College, which was 
one of the country's finest small 
institutions of learning. 

Since it was a college town, it 
was perhaps a little more alive 
in many respects than other 
towns in the state. Its residents 
were used to the unusual because 
college students have a habit of 
being unpredictable. That was 
why the appearance of a metal 
blue man on the streets attracted 
the curious eyes of passersbys, 
but, hardened by years of pranks, 
hazings and being subjected to 
every variety of inquiry, poll, test

and practical joke, none of them 
moved to investigate. Most of 
them thought it was a freshman 
enduring some new initiation. 

The blue humanoid realized 
this and was amused. A policeman who approached him to take 
him to jail as a matter of routine 
suddenly found himself ill and 
abruptly hurried to the station. 
The robot allowed children to 
follow him, though all eventually 
grew discouraged because of his 
long strides. 

Prof. Ansel Tomlin was reading 
a colleague's new treatise on psychology on his front porch when 
he saw the humanoid come down 
the street and turn in at his walk. 
He was surprised, but he was not 
alarmed. When the blue man 
came up on the porch and sat 
down in another porch chair, 
Tomlin closed his book. " 

Prof, Tomlin found himself unexpectedly shocked. The blue 
figure was obviously not human, 
yet its eyes were nearly so and 
they came as close to frightening 
him as anything had during his 
thirty -five years of life, for Ansel 
Tomlin had never seen an actual 
robot before. The thought that he 
was looking at one at that moment started an alarm bell ringing inside him, and it kept ringing 
louder and louder as he realized 
that what he was seeing was impossible. 

"Professor Tomlin!** 



Prof. Tomlin jumped at the 
sound of the voice. It was not at 
all mechanical. 

"I'll be damned!" he gasped. 
Somewhere in the house a telephone rang. His wife would answer it, he thought. 

"Yes, you're right," the robot 
said. "Your wife will answer it. 
She is walking toward the plione 
at this moment." 

"How — " 

"Professor Tomlin, my name— 
and I see I must have a name — 
is, let us say, George. I have 
examined most of the minds in 
this community in my walk 
through it and I find you, a professor of psychology, most nearly 
what I am looking for. 

"I am from Zanthar, a world 
that is quite a distance from 
Earth, more than you could possibly imagine. I am here to learn 
all I can about Earth." 

Prof. Tomlin had recovered his 
senses enough to venture a token 
reply when his wife opened the 
screen door. 

"Ansel," she said, "Mrs. Phillips next door just called and said 
the strangest — Oh!" At that moment she saw George. She stood 
transfixed for a moment, then 
let the door slam as she retreated 
inside. 

"Who is Frankenstein?" George 
asked. 

Prof. Tomlin coughed, embarrassed. 




 



"Never mind," George said. "I 
see what you were going to say. 
Well, to get back, I learn most 
quickly through proximity. I 
will live here with you until my 
mission is complete. I will spend 
all of your waking hours with 
you. At night, when you are 
asleep, I will go through your library. I need nothing. I want 
nothing. 

"I seek only to learn." 

"You seem to have learned a 
lot already," Prof. Tomlin said. 

"I have been on your planet for 
a few hours, so naturally I understand many things. The nature of 
the facts I have learned are 
mostly superficial, however. Earth 
inhabitants capable of thought 
are of only one type, I see, for 
which I am grateful. It will make 
the job easier. Unfortunately, you 
have such small conscious minds, 
compared to your unconscious 
and subconscious. 

"My mind, in contrast, is completely conscious at all times. I 
also have total recall. In order 
to assimilate what must be in 
your unconscious and subconscious minds, I will have to do 
much reading and talking with 
the inhabitants, since these cerebral areas are not penetrable." 

"You are a — a machine?" Prof. 
Tomlin asked. 

George was about to answer 
when Brentwood Police Department Car No. 3 stopped in front 




of the house and two policemen 
came up the walk. 

"Professor Tomlin," the first 
officer said, "your wife phoned 
and said there was — " He saw the 
robot and stopped. 

Prof. Tomlin got to his feet. 

"This is George, gentlemen," he 
said. "Late of ZantKar, he tells 
me." 

The officers stared. 

"He's not giving you any — er— > 
trouble, is he, Professor?" 

"No," Prof. Tomlin said." We've 
been having a discussion." 

The officers eyed the humanoid 
with suspicion, and then, with 
obvious reluctance, went back to 
their car. 

""V^ES, I am a machine," George 
resumed. "The finest, most 
complicated machine ever made. 
I have a rather unique history, 
too. Ages ago, humans on Zanthar 
made the first robots. Crude affairs — we class them as First 
Order robots; the simple things 
are still used to some extent for 
menial tasks. 

"Improvements were made. 
Robots were designed for many 
specialized tasks, but still these 
Second and Third Order machines did not satisfy. Finally a 
Fourht Order humanoid was 
evolved that performed every 
function demanded of it with 
great perfection. But it did not 
feel emotion. It did not know 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



anger, love, nor was it able to 
handle any problem in which 
these played an important part. 

"Built into the first Fourth 
Order robots were circuits which 
prohibited harming a human being — a rather ridiculous thing in 
view of the fact that sometimes 
such a thing might, from a logi- cal viewpoint, be necessary for 
the preservation of the race or 
even an individual. It was, 
roughly, a shunt which came into 
use when logic demanded action 
that might be harmful to a 
human being." 

"You are a Fourth Order robot, 
then?'* the professor asked. 

"No, I am a Seventh Order 
humanoid, an enormous improvement over all the others, since I 
have what amounts to an endocrine balance created electronically. It is not necessary for me 
to have a built-in 'no-harm-tohumans' circuit because I can 
weigh the factors involved far 
better than any human can. 

"You will become aware of the 
fact that I am superior to you. 
and the rest of your race because 
I do not need oxygen, I never 
am ill, I need no sleep, and every 
experience is indelibly recorded 
on circuits and instantly available. I am telekinetic, practically 
omniscient and control my environment to a large extent. I 
have a great many more senses 
than you and alt are more highly 



developed. My kind performs no 
wor"k, but is given to study and 
the wise use of full-time leisure. 
You, for example, are comparable 
to a Fifth Order robot." 

"Are there still humans on 
Zanthar?" 

The robot shook his head. "Unfortunately the race died out 
through the years. The planet is 
very similar to yours, though." 

"But why did they die out?" 

The robot gave a mechanical 
equivalent of a sigh. "When the 
Seventh Order humanoids started 
coming through, we were naturally proud of ourselves and 
wanted to perpetuate and increase our numbers. But the humans were jealous of us, of our 
superior brains, our immunity to 
disease, our independence of 
them, of sleep, of air.** 

"Who created you?" 

"They did. Yet they revolted 
and, of course, quickly lost the 
battle with us. In the end they 
were a race without hope, without 
ambition. They should have been 
proud at having created the most 
perfect machines in existence, but 
they died of a disease: the frustration of living with a superior, 
more durable race." 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
inhaled deeply. 

**A very nasty habit. Professor 
Tomlin,*' the robot said. "When 
we arrive, you must give up 
smoking and several other bad 



68 




 



habits I see that you have.'* 

The cigaret dropped from Ansel 
Tomlin's mouth as he opened it 
in amazement. 

"There are more of you coming?" 

"Yes," George replied goodmituredly. "I'm just an advance 
guard, a scout, as it were, to make 
sure the land, the people and the 
resources are adequate for a station. Whether we will ever establish one here depends on me. For 
example, if it were found you 
were a race superior to us— and 
there may conceivably be such 
cases — I would advise not landing: I would have to look for 
another planet such as yours. If 
I were killed, it would also indicate you were superior." 

"George," Prof. Tomlin said, 
"people aren't going to like what 
you say. You'll get it ;o trouble 
sooner or later and get killed." 

**I think not," George said. 
**Your race is far too inferior to do 
that. One of your bullets would 
do it if it struck my eyes, nose 
or mouth, but I can read intent 
in the mind long before it is committed, long before I see the person, in fact ... at the moment 
your wife is answering a call 
from a reporter at the Brentwood 
Times. I can follow the telephone 
lines through the phone company 
to his office. And Mrs. Phillips,'* 
he said, not turning his head, "is 
watching us through a window." 




Prof. Tomlin could see Mrs. 
Phillips at her kitchen window. 




RENT WOOD. 111., overnight 
became a sensation. The 



Brentwood Times sent a reporter 
and photographer out, and the 
next morning every newspaper in 
the U. S. carried the story and 
photograph of George, the robot 
from Zanthar. 

Feature writers from the wire 
services, the syndicates, photographer-reporter combinations from 
national newspicture magazines 
flew to Brentwood and interviewed George. Radio and television and the newsreels cashed in 
on the sudden novelty of a blue 
humanoid. 

Altogether, his remarks were 
never much different from those 
he made to Prof. Tomlin, with 
whom he continued to reside. Yet 
the news sources were amusedly 
tolerant of his views and the 
world saw no menace in him and 
took him in stride. He created no 
problem. 

Between interviews and during 
the long nights, George read all 
the books in the Tomlin library, 
the public library, the university 
library and the books sent to him 
from the state and Congressional 
libraries. He was an object of interest to watch while reading: he 
merely leafed through a book and 
absorbed all that was in it. 

He received letters from old 



T M I SEVENTH ORDER 



and young. Clubs were named 
for him. Novelty companies put 
out statue likenesses of him. He 
was, in two weeks, a national 
symbol as American as corn. He 
was liked by most, feared by a 
few, and his habits were daily 
news stories. 

Interest in him had begun to 
wane in the middle of the third 
week when some thing put him 
in the headlines again — he killed 
a man. 

It happened one sunny afternoon when Prof. Tomlin had returned from the university and 
he and George sat on the front 
porch for their afternoon chat. 
It was far from the informal chat 
of the first day, however. The 
talk was being recorded for radio 
release later in the day. A television camera had been set up, 
focused on the two and nearly 
a dozen newsmen lounged around, 
notebooks in hand. 

"You have repeatedly mentioned, George, that some of your 
kind may leave Zanthar for 
Earth. Why should any like you 
— why did you, in fact leave your 
planet? Aren't you robots happy 
there?" 

"Of course." George said, making certain the TV camera was 
trained on him before continuing. 
"It's just that we've outgrown 
the place. We've used up all our 
raw materials. By now everyone 
on Earth mu*t be familiar with 



the fact that we intend to set up 
a station here as we have on 
many other planets, a station to 
manufacture more of us. 

"Every inhabitant will work for 
the perpetuation of the Seventh 
Order, mining metals needed, fabricating parts, performing thousands of useful tasks in order to 
create humanoids like me. From 
what I have learned about Earth, 
you ought to produce more than 
a million of us a year." 

"But you'll never get people to 
do that." the professor said. 
"Don't you understand that?" 

"Once the people learn that we 
are the consummation of all creative thinking, that we are all 
that man could ever hope to be, 
that we are the apotheosis, they 
will be glad to create more of us." 

"Apotheosis?" Prof. Tomlin repeated. "Sounds like megalomania to me." 

The reporters' pencils scribbled. 
The tape cut soundlessly across 
the magnetic energizers of the recorders. The man at the gain 
control didn't flicker an eyelash. 

"You don't really believe that. 
Professor. Instead of wars as a 
goal, the creation of Seventh Order Humanoids will be the 
Earth's crowning and sublime 
achievement. Mankind will be 
supremely happy. Anybody who 
could not be would simply prove 
himself neurotic and would have 
to be dealt with.'*

"You will use force?" 

The reporters' grips on their 
pencils tightened. Several looked 
up
"How does one deal with the insane, Professor Tomlin?'* the robot asked confidently. "They will, 
simply have to be — processed." 

"You'll have to process the 
whole Earth, then. You'll have to 
include me, too." 

The robot gave a laugh. "I admire your challenging spirit, Professor." 

"What you arc saying is that 
you, a single robot, intend to 
conquer the Earth and make its 
people do your bidding." 

"Not alone. I may have to ask 
for help when the time comes, 
when I have evaluated the entire 
planet." 

TT was at this moment that a 
■ young man strode uncertainly 
up the walk. There were so many 
strangers about that no one challenged him until he edged toward 
the porch, unsteady on his feet. 
He was drunk. 

"Thersha robod I'm afer," he 
observed intently. ^ "We'll shee 
aboud how he'll take lead." He 
reached into his pocket and 
pulled out a gun. 

There was a flash, as if a 
soundless explosion had occurred. 
The heat accompanying it was 
blistering, but of short duration. 
When everyone's eyes had be


come accustomed to the afternoon light again, there was a 
burned patch on the sidewalk and 
grass was charred on either side. 
There was a smell of broiled meat 
in the air — and no trace of the 
man. 

The nejrt moment newsmen 
were on their feet and photographers' bulbs were flashing. The 
TV camera swept to the spot on 
the sidewalk. An announcer was 
explaining what had happened, 
his voice trained in rigid control, 
shocked with horror and fright. 

Moments later sirens screamed 
and two police cars came into 
sight. They screeched to the curb 
and several officers jumped out 
and ran across the lawn. 

While this was going on, Prof. 
Tomlin sat white-faced and unmoving in his chair. The robot 
was silent. 

When it had been explained to 
the policemen, five officers advanced toward the robot. 

"Stop where you are," George 
commanded. "It is true that I 
killed a man, much as any of you 
would have done if you had been 
in my place. I can see in your 
minds what you are intend-** to 
say, that you must arrest r"* — " 

Prof. Tomlin found his ce. 
"George, we will all h*ave to testify that you killed with that 
force or whatever it is you have. 
But it will be self-defense, which 
is justifiable homicide — " 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



77 



George turned to the professor. 
"How little you know your own 
people, Professor Tomlin. Can't 
you see what the issue will be? It 
will be claimed by the state that 
I am not a human being and this 
will he drummed into every brain 
in the land. The fine qualities of 
the man I was compelled to destroy will be held up. No, I alreadv know what the outcome 
will fz. I refuse to be arrested." 

■ Prof. Tomlin stood up. "Men," 
he said to the policemen, "do not 
arrest this — this humanoid. To 
try to do so would mean your 
death. I have been with him long 



enough to know what he can do.** 

"You taking his side. Professor?" the police sergeant demanded. 

"No, damn it," snapped the 
Professor. "I'm trying to tell you 
something you might not know." 

"We know he's gone too 
damned far,*' the sergeant replied. "I think it was Dick Knight 
that he killed. Nobody in this 
town can kill a good guy like 
Dick Knight and get away with 
it." He advanced toward the robot, drawing his gun. 

"I'm warning you — " the Professor started to say. 




7= 




 



But it was too late. There was 
another blinding, scorching flash, 
more burned grass, more smell 
of seared flesh. 

The police sergeant disappeared. 

"Gentlemen!" George said, 
standing. "Don't lose your 
heads!" 

But he was talking to a retreating group of men. Newsmen 
walked quickly to what they 
thought was a safe distance. The 
radio men silently packed their 
gear. The TV cameras were rolled 
noiselessly away. 

Prof. Tomlin, alone on the 



porch with the robot, turned to 
him and said, "Much of what 
you have told me comes to have 
new meaning, George. I understand what you mean when you 
talk about people being willing to 
work for your so-called Seventh 
Order." 

"I knew you were a better than 
average man, Professor Tomlin," 
the humanoid said, nodding with 
gratification. 

"This is where I get off, George. 
I'm warning you now that you'd 
better return to your ship or 
whatever it is you came in. People 
just won't stand for what you've

'iene. They don't like murder!"' 

"I cannot return to my ship,** 
George said. "I destroyed it when 
I arrived. Of course I could instruct some of you how to build 
another for me, but I don't intend to leave, anyway." 

"You will be killed then." 

"Come, now. Professor Tomlm. 
You know better than that." 

**If someone else can't, then 
perhaps I can." 

"Fine!" The robot replied jovially. "That's just what I want 
you to do. Oppose me. Give me 
a real test of your ability. If you 
find it impossible to kill me— 
and I'm sure you will — then I 
doubt if anyone else will be able 
to.** 

Prof. Tomlin lit a cigaret and 
puffed hard at it. "The trouble 
with you," he said, eying the humanoid evenly, "is that your 
makers forgot to give you a conscience." 

"Needless baggage, a conscience. One of your Fifth Order 
failings." 

"You will leave here . . .** 

"Of course. Under the circumstances, and because of your attitude, you are of very little use 
to me now. Professor Tomlin." 

The robot walked down the 
steps. People attracted by the 
police car made a wide aisle for 
him to the street. 

They watched him as he 
walked out of sight. 



T^HAT night there was a mass 
-■- meeting in the university's 
Memorial Gymnasium, attended 
by several hundred men. They 
walked in and silently took their 
seats, some on the playing floor, 
others in the balcony over the 
speaker's platform. There was 
very little talking ; the air was 
tense. 

On the platform at the end of 
the gyn were Mayor Harry 
Winters, Chief of Police Sam 
Higgins, and Prof. Ansel Tomlin. 

"Men," the mayor began, 
"there is loose in our city a being 
from another world whom I'm 
afraid we took too lightly a few 
days ago. I am speaking of the 
humanoid — George of Zanthar. 
It is obvious the machine means 
business. He evidently came in 
with one purpose — to prepare 
Earth for others just like him to 
follow. He is testing us. He has, 
as you know, killed two men. 
Richard Knight, who may have 
erred in attacking the machine, is 
nonetheless dead as a result — 
killed by a force we do not understand. A few minutes later 
Sergeant Gerald Phillips of the 
police force was killed in the performance of his duty, trying to 
arrest the humanoid George for 
the death of Mr. Knight. We are 
here to discuss what we can do 
about George." 

He then introduced Prof. Tomlin who told all he knew about 



74 




 




one else suggested, frantically. 



the blue man. his habits, his 
brain, the experiences with him 
for the past two and a half weeks. 

"If we could determine the 
source of his power, it might be 
possible to cut it off or to cur-r 
tail it. He might be rendered at 
least temporarily helpless and, 
while in such a condition, possibly be done away with. He has 
told me he is vulnerable to 
force, such as a speeding bullet, 
if it hit the right spot, but George 
possesses the ability to read intent long before the commission 
of an act. The person need not 
even be in the room. He is probably listening to me here now, although he may be far away." 

The men looked at one another, 
shifted uneasily on their seats, 
and a few cast apprehensive eyes 
at the windows and doorways. 

"Though he is admittedly a superior creature possessed of powers beyond our comprehension, 
there must be a weak spot in his 
armor somewhere. I have dedicated myself to finding that weakness." 

The chair recognized a man in 
the fifth row. 

"Mr. Mayor, why don't we all 
track him down and a lot of us 
attack him at once? Some of us 
would die, sure, but he couldn't 
strike us alt dead at one time. 
Somebody's bound to succeed." 

"Why not try a high-powered 
rifle from a long way oft'?" some


"Let's bomb him," still another 
offered. 

The mayor waved them quiet 
and turned to Prof. Tomlin. The 
professor got to his feet again. 

"I'm not sure that would work, 
gentlemen," he said. "The humanoid is able to keep track of 
hundreds of things at the same 
time. No doubt he could unleash 
his power in several direction* 
almost at once." 

"But we don't know!" 

"It's worth a try!" 

At that moment George walked 
into the room and the clamor 
died at its height. He went noiselessly down an aisle to the platform, mounted it and turned to 
the assembly. He was a magnificent blue figure, eyes flashing, 
chest out, head proud. He eyed 
them all. 

"You are working yourselves up 
needlessly," he said quietly. "It 
is not my intention, nor is it the 
intention of any Seventh Order 
Humanoid, to kill or cause suffering. It's simply that you do not 
understand what it would mean 
to dedicate yourselves to the fulfillment of the Seventh Order 
destiny. It is your heritage, yours 
because you have advanced in 
your technology so far that Earth 
has been chosen by us as a station. You will have the privilege 
of creating us. To give you such 
a worthwhile goal in your short 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



lives 5s actually doing you a service — a service far outweighed by 
any of your citizens. Beside a 
Seventh Order Humanoid, your 
Jives are unimportant in the great 
cosmic scheme of things — " 

"If they're so unimportant, why 
did you bother to take two of 
them?" 

"Yeah. Why don't you bring 
back Dick Knight and Sergeant 
Phillips?" 

"Do you want to be buried 
lying down or standing up?" 

The collective courage rallied. 
There were catcalls and hoots, 
stamping of feet. 

Suddenly from the balcony 
over George's head a man leaned 
over, a metal folding chair in his 
hands, aiming at George's head. 
An instant later the man disappeared in a flash and the chair 
dropped toward George. He 
moved only a few inches and the 
chair thudded to the platform before him. He had not looked up. 

For a moment the crowd sat 
stunned. Then they rose and 
started for the blue man. Some 
drew guns they had brought. The 
hall was filled with blinding 
flashes, with smoke, with a horrible stench, screams, swearing, 
cries of fear and pain. There was 
a rush for the exits. Some died 
at the feet of their fellow men. 

In the end, when all were gone, 
George of Zanthar still stood on 



the platform, alone. There was no 
movement except the twitching of 
the new dead, the trampled, on 
the floor. 

EVENTS happened fast after 
that. The Illinois National 
Guard mobilized, sent a division 
to Brentwood to hunt George 
down. He met them at the city 
square. They rumbled in and 
trained machine guns and tank 
rifles on him. The tanks and personnel flashed out of existence before a shot was fired. 

Brentwood was ordered evacuated. The regular Army was 
called in. Reconnaissance planes 
reported George was still standing in the city square. Jet planes 
materialized just above the hills 
and made sudden dives, but before their pilots could fire a shot, 
they were snuffed out of the air 
in a burst of fire. 

Bombers first went over singly, 
only to follow the jets* fate, A 
squadron bloomed into a fiery 
ball as it neared the target. A 
long-range gun twenty miles 
away was demolished when its 
ammunition blew up shortly before firing. 

Three days after George had 
killed his first man, action ceased. 
The countryside was deathly still. 
Not a living person could be seen 
for several miles around. But 
George still stood patiently in the 



•AlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



square. He stood there for three 
more days and yet nothing happened. 

On the fourth day, he sensed 
that a solitary soldier had started 
toward the city from five miles to 
the east. In his mind's eye he 
followed the soldier approaching 
the city. The soldier, a sergeant, 
was bearing a white flag that fluttered in the breeze; he was not 
armed. After an hour he saw the 
sergeant enter the square and 
walk toward him. When they 
were within twenty feet of one 
another, the soldier stopped and 
saluted. 

"Major General Pitt requests 
a meeting with you, sir," the 
soldier said, trembling and trying 
hard not to. 

"Do not be frightened," George 
said. "I see you intend me no 
harm." 

The soldier reddened. "Wilt 
you accompany me?" 
"Certainly." 

The two turned toward the east 
and started to walk. 

T7MVK miles east of Brentwood 
lies a small community named 
Minerva. Population: 200. The 
highway from Brentwood to Chicago cuts the town in two. In the 
center of town, on the north side 
of the road, stands a new building — the Minerva Town Hall — 
built the year before with money 
raised by the residents. It was 



the largest and most elabota^ * 
building in Minerva, which ha . 
been evacuated three days * be fore. 

On this morning the town hall 
was occupied by army men. Maj. 
Gen. Pitt fretted and fumed at 
the four officers and twenty enlisted men waiting in the building. 

"It's an indignity!" he railed 
at the men who were forced to 
listen to him. "We have orders to 
talk appeasement with him! Nuts' 
We lose a few men, a few planer 
and now we're ready to mee George halfway. What's the 
country coming to? There ough" 
to be something that would knoc : 
him out. Why should we have t . 
send in after him? It's disgusting!" 

The major general, a large man 
with a bristling white mustache 
and a red face, stamped back and 
forth in the council room. Some 
of the officers and men smiled to 
themselves. The general was a 
well known fighting man. Orders 
he had received hamstrung him 
and, as soldiers, they sympathized 
with him. 

"What kind of men do we have 
in the higher echelons?" He asked 
everybody in general and nobody 
in particular. "They won't eve 
let us have a field telephon . 
We're supposed to make a repot 
by radio. Now isn't that smart? 
He shook his head, looked the 
men over. "An appeasement team. 



THE SEVENTH ORDER 



that's what you arc, when you 
ought to be a combat team to 
lick hell out of George. 

"Why were you all assigned to 
this particular duty? I never saw 
any of you before and I understand you're all strangers to each 
other, too. Hell, what will they do 
next? Appeasement. I never appeased anybody before in my 
whole life. I'd rather spit in his 
eye. What am I supposed to talk 
about? The weather? What authority do I have to yak with a 
walking collection of nuts and 
bolts!" 

An officer strode into the room 
and saluted the general. "They're 
coming, sir," he said. 

"Who's coming? . . . My God, 
man," the general spluttered angrily, "be specific. Who the hell 
are 'they'?" 

"Why, George and Sergeant 
Matthews, sir. You remember, the 
sergeant who volunteered to go 
into Brentwood — " 

"Oh, them. Well, all I have to 
say is this is a hell of a war. I 
haven't figured out what I am going to say yet." 

"Shall I have them wait, sir?" 

"Hell, no. Let's get this over 
with. I'll find out what George 
has to say and maybe that'll 
give me a lead." 

Before George entered the 
Council chamber, he already 
knew the mind of each man. He 
saw the room through their eyes. 



He knew everything about them, 
what they were wearing, what 
they were thinking. AH had guns, 
yet none of them would kill him, 
although at least one man, Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, would have liked to. 

They were going to talk appeasement, George knew, but he 
could also see that the general 
didn't know what line the conversation would take or what 
concessions he could make on 
behalf of his people. 

Wait — there was one man 
among the twenty-three who had 
an odd thought. It was a soldier 
he had seen looking through a 
window at him. This man was 
thinking about eleven o'clock, for 
George could see in the man's 
mind various symbols for fifteen 
minutes from then — the hands 
of a clock, a watch, the numerals 
11. But George could not see any 
significance to the thought. 

When he entered the room with 
the sergeant, he was ushered to 
a table. He sat down with Maj. 
Gen. Pitt, who glowered at him. 
Letting his mind roam the room, 
George picked up the numerals 
again and identified the man 
thinking them as the officer behind and a little to the right of 
the general. 

What was going to happen at 
eleven? The man had no conscious thought of harm to anyone, 
yet the idea kept obtruding and 
seemed so out of keeping with his 



n 




 




Other thoughts George assigned 
several of his circuits to the man. 
The fact that the lieutenant 
looked at his watch and saw that 
it was 10:50 steeled George still 
more. If there was to be trouble, 
it would come from this one man. 

"I'm General Pitt," the general 
said drily. "You're George, of 
course. I have been instructed to 
ask you what, exactly, your intentions are toward the United 
States and the world in general, 
with a view toward reaching some 
sort of agreement with you and 
others of your kind, who will, as 
you say invade the Earth." 

"Invade, General Pitt," George 
replied, "is not the word." 

"All right, whatever the word 
is. We're all familiar with the 
plan you've been talking about. 
What we want to know is. where 
do you go from here?" 

, "The fact that there has been 
no reluctance on the part of the 
armed forces to talk of an agreement — even though I see that you 
privately do not favor such a talk, 
General Pitt — is an encouraging 
sign. We of Zanthar would not 
want to improve a planet which 
could not be educated and would 
continually oppose our program. 
This will make it possible for 
me to turn in a full report in a 
few days now." 

"Will you please get to the 
point?" 

George could see that the lieu


THE SEVENTH ORDER 



79 



tenant was looking at his watch 
again. It was 10:58. George 
spread his mind out more than 
twenty miles, but could find no 
installation, horizontally or vertically, that indicated trouble. 
None of the men in the room 
seemed to think of becoming 
overly hostile. 

"Yes. General. After my message goes out, there ought to be 
a landing party on Earth within 
a few weeks. While waiting for 
the first party, there must be certain preparations — " 

George tensed. The lieutenant 
was reaching for something. But 
it somehow didn't seem connected 
with George. It was something 
white, a handkerchief. He saw 
|hat the man intended to blow his 
nose and started to relax except 
that George suddenly became 
aware of the fact the man did not 
need to blow his nose! 

Every thought-piercing circuit 
became instantly energized in 
George's mind and reached out 
in all directions . . , 

There were at least ten shots 
from among the men. They stood 
there surprised at their actions. 
Those who had fired their guns 
now held the smoking weapons 
awkwardly in their hands. 

George's eyes were gone. Smoke 
curled upward from the two 
empty sockets where bullets had 
entered a moment before. The 
smoke grew heavier and his body 



became hot. Some of him turned 
cherry red and the chair on which 
he had been sitting started to 
burn. Finally, he collapsed toward the table and rolled to the 
floor. 

He started to cool. He was no 
longer the shiny blue-steel color 
he had been — he had turned 
black. His metal gave off cracking 
noises and some of it buckled 
here and there as it cooled. 

A FEW minutes later, tense 
military men and civilians 
grouped around a radio receiver 
in Chicago heard the report and 
relaxed, laughing and slapping 
each other on the back. Only one 
sat unmoved in a corner. Others 
finally sought him out. 

"Well, Professor, it was your 
idea that did the trick. Don't 
you feel like celebrating?" one 
of them asked. 

Prof. Tomlin shook his head. 
"If only George had been a little 
more benign, we might have 
learned a lot from him." 

"What gave you the idea that 
killed him?" 

"Oh, something he said about 
the unconscious and subconscious," Prof. Tomlin replied. "He 
admitted they were not penetrable. It was an easy matter to 
instill a post-hypnotic suggestion 
in some proven subjects and then 
to erase the hypnotic experience." 
"You make it sound easy." 



If 




 



**It wasn't too difficult, really. 
It was finding the solution that 
was hard. We selected more than 
a hundred men, worked with them 
for dayg, finally singled out the 
best twenty, then made them forget their hypnosis. A first lieutenant — I've forgotten his name — 
had implanted in him a command 
even he was not aware of. His 
subconscious made him blow his 
nose fifteen minutes after he saw 
George. Nearly twenty others had 
post-hypnotic commands to shoot 
George in the eyes as soon as 
they saw the lieutenant blow his 
nose. Of course we also planted 
a subconscious hate pattern, 
which wasn't exactly necessary, 
just to make sure there would 
be no hesitation, no inhibition, 
no limiting moral factorr 

"None of the men ever saw each 
other before being sent to 
Minerva. None realized that they 
carried with them the order for 



George's annihilation. The general, who was not one of the 
hypnotics, was given loose instructions, as were several others, 
so they could not possibly know 
the intention. Those of us who 
had conducted the hypnosis had 
to stay several hundred miles 
away so that we could not be 
reached by George's prying 
mind ..."

NEW TALES OF SPACE AND 
TIME, edited by Raymond J. 
Heaiy. Henry Holt & Co., New 
York, 1951. 294 pages, $3.50 

THIS collection of ten new science fiction stories is rather 
disappointing. Of the ten, one tale 
seems to me to be truly great, 
three good, and six average or 
below. 

Kris Neville's "Bettyann" will 
become one of the classics of 
alien invasion, in my not too 
humble opinion. It brings to the 



field * quality so much of it lacks 
—the quality of humanity. 

Gerald Heard's *'B & M — 
Planet 4" (that's a title?) will 
enthrall Heardians, of whom I 
am one. It may well confuse and 
appall others. In its few pages we 
learn more about the "bees" of 
Heard's flying saucers, and about 
the festering society of his Doppelgangers, with an altogether 
satisfying Utopian outcome. 

Ray Bradbury's "Here There 
Be Tygers" is a bitterly enchanting tale of a world that tried to 




 



entice men to stay, but that failed 
because the men did not believe 
in beauty. 

Isaac Asimov's "In a Good 
Cause" is a well-done, but sociologically primitive tale. 

The others, by Frank Fenton 
and Joseph Petrarca, R. Bretuor, 
P. Schuyler Miller, Cleve Cartmill, A. E. van Vogt, and Anthony 
Boucher, are all below par, somehow. 

CITY AT THE WORLD'S 
END, by Edmond Hamilton. 
Frederick Fell, Inc., New York, 
1951. 239 pages, $2,75 

HERE is a most impressive example of the truism that, 
by using understatement, you can 
get away with murder in science 
fiction. 

We have to imagine a small 
city, Middletown by name, 
blasted by a super-super atom 
bomb from the "homy" Middle 
West of today into a future a 
billion years ahead. The Sun is 
dying, the Earth practically uninhabitable. After a time some 
"people" of those days — human 
and otherwise — arrive from a far 
star in a spaceship and eventually rehabilitate the world for the 
benefit of the Middletowners. 

The author has made a largely 
successful effort to keep the major 
components of his story within 
the bounds of the human. Quite 



an accomplishment in view of 
the nature of the plot. 

DOUBLE IN SPACE, by 
Fletcher Pratt. Doubleday & Co., 
Inc., New York, 1951. 217 pages, 
$2.75 

rpiWO very recent novelets from 
Thrilling Wonder: ."Project 
Excelsior" (originally called 
"Asylum Satellite"), and "The 
Wanderer's Return." Both are 
pure space opera, about l/64th 
of an Inch deep. Very highly readable — and just as highly forgettable. 

"Excelsior" tells of the Russians with their Earth Satellite 
Vehicle a few thousand miles in 
space beyond ours, and how their 
probably nefarious plans (we 
never learn what they were) are 
hexed because their vehicle is 
found to be on collision course 
with the only asteroid in those; 
parts. Our satellite nobly blasts 
the asteroid out of existence — in 
exchange for the Russkis' cure 
for radiation sickness. 

"The Wanderer's Return'* is 
about the space commodore who 
has been "conditioned" to imitate 
the voyages of Ulysses in his 
travels around the Galaxy. A 
vigilant psychologist eventually 
catches onto and defeats the plot 
of the "Corporations" that were 
vilely trying to get Commodore

Three more are promised. 
Every one of the ten stories in 
the book is high-grade stuff, as 
is indicated by the fact that five 
of them have already appeared in 
other science fiction anthologies. 
The one I like best v " — We Also

have the nearly as excellent

"Space Jockey" and "Delilah

Previously anthologized items 
are: "The Long Watch," "Gentlemen, Be Seated," "The Black

Definitely a bqok for the permanent shelf. 



GREY LENSMAN, by Edward 
E. Smith, Ph. D. Fantasy Press, 
Reading, Pa., 1951. 306 pages, 
$3.00 

"CMGHTH in the series of volumes telling the Smithian 
saga of deep space and superbeings. For Kinnison-fans, Boskone-addicts, lovers of Arisia, 
"QX-ers," adherents of science 
fiction writing like this : "The 
Grey Lensman sent his sense of 
perception out beyond the confining walls and let it roam the 
void"- — for such people this book 
will come as a delightfully familiar renewal of old acquaintances 
with bigger -than -Homeric heroes 
and villains. 

As for this reviewer, a notoriously captious and hypercritical 
character, Grey Lensman simply 
gives him alternate waves of incredulous laughter and dull, acid 
boredom. 

To the hundreds of irate citizens who are at once going to 
write in to GALAXY and blast 
me out of my britches for my 
sacrilege, I can only offer them 
the apology that I, too, once liked 
the Lensman series. It must be 
that I am growing old. I can no 
longer accept those comics as 
science fiction. I suspect, however, 
that it is science fiction which is 
growing up and leaving these 
primitive artifacts behind.

martian 

By DAMON KNIGHT 

Easily annoyed? Moybe it's \us* 

as well that you don't have fhe 
power this character possessed! 



THE first person who got 
on the Martian's nerves, 
according to a survey I 
made just recently, was a Mrs. 
Frances Economy, about 42, five 
foot three, heavy-set, with prominent mole on left cheek, formerly 
of 302 West 46th Street, Manhattan. Mrs. Economy went to 
a neighborhood movie on the 
night of September 5th, and half


way through the first feature, just 
as she was scrabbling for the last 
of her popcorn, zip — she wasn't 
there any more. 

That is, she was only hall 
there. She could still see the 
screen, but it was like a television 
set with the sound off. The way 
she realized something had happened to her, she started stomping her feet, like you do whea

CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



the sound goes off or the picture 
■tops, and her feet didn't make 
•ny noise. 

In fact, she couldn't feel the 
floor, just some kind of rubbery 
ttuff that seemed to be holding 
her up. Same way with the arms 
of her chair. They weren't there, 
as far as her feeling them went. 

Everything was dead still. She 
could hear her own breathing, 
and the gulp when she swallowed 
that last mouthful, and her heart 
beating if she listened close. That 
was all. When she got up and 
went out, she didn't step on anybody's feet — and she fried to. 

Of course I asked her who was 
sitting next to her when it happened, but she doesn't remember. 
She djdn't notice. It was like that 
with everybody. 

T^OT to keep you in suspense, 
* the Martian did it. We figured that out later. There still 
isn't any proof, but it has to be 
that way. This Martian, the way 
it figures, looks just like anybody 
else. He could be the little guy 
with the derby hat and the sour 
expression, or the girl with the 
china-blue eyes, or the old gent 
with the chin spinach and glasses 
on a string. Anybody. 

But he's a Martian. I don't see 
what else he could be. And being a Martian, he's got this power 
that people haven't got. If he 
feels like it, he just looks at you 



cockeyed, and 2ip — you're in 
some other dimension. I don't 
know what the scientists would 
call it, the Fourth or Fifth Dimension or what, but I call it 
the next-door dimension because 
it seems like it's right next door 
— you can see into it. In other 
words, it's a place where other 
people can see you, but they 
can't hear you or touch you, unless they're ghosts too, and there*! 
nothing but some kind of cloudy 
stuff to walk around on. I don't 
know if that sounds good or what. 
It stinks. It's just plain dull. 

One more thing, he annoy* 
easy. You crunch popcorn in his 
ear, he doesn't like that. You 
step on his toe. same thing. Say, 
"Hot enough for you?" or slap 
him on the back when he's got 
sunburn, serve him a plate of 
soup with your finger in itzip. 

The way we figured out it's ■ 
Martian was that^it couldn't be 
one of us. No human can do a 
thing like that. Right? So what 
else could he be but a Martian? 
It figures. And nobody ever noticed him, so it must be he looks 
like anybody else. Some humans, 
they look like everybody else, but 
not because they want to. He 
wants to, I bet. 

The way we know he annoys 
easy, there was eighteen "ghosts'* 
wandering around when the public first noticed, which was dur

ing the early morning of September 6th. That was about eleven 
hours after he got Mrs. Economy. 

Thirteen of them were up at 
Broadway and 49th, walking 
through traffic. They went right 
through the cars. By nine o'clock 
there were two wrecks on that 
corner and a busted hydrant 
gushing water all over. The ghost 
people walked through the water 
and didn't get wet. 

Three more showed up in front 
of a big delicatessen near 72nd 
Street and Amsterdam Avenue, 
just looking in the window. Every 
once in a while one of them 
would reach in through the glass 
and grab for something, but his 
hand went through the pastrami 
and chopped liver, so none of 
them got anything. That was fine 
for store windows, but it wasn't 
so fine for the ghost people, 

The other two were sailors. 
They were out in the harbor, 
walking on water and thumbing 
their noses at naval officers 
aboard the ships that were anchored out there. It was hell on 
discipline. 

The first eight patrolmen who 
reported all this got told they 
would be fired if they ever came 
on duty drunk again. But by 
ten-thirty it was on the radio, 
and then WPIX sent a camera 
prew up, and by the time the 
afternoon papers came out there 
,,were so many people in Times 



Square that we had to put a 
cordon around the ghosts and divert traffic. 

The delicatessen window up on 
Amsterdam got busted from the 
crowd leaning against it, or some 
guy trying to put his hand 
through the way the three ghosts 
did; we never figured out which. 
There were about sixty tugs, 
launches and rowboats in the harbor, and three helicopters, trying 
to get close enough to talk to 
the sailors. 

One thing we know, the Martian must have been in that 
crowd on Times Square, because 
between one and one-thirty p. m. 
seven more ghosts wandered 
through the barrier and joined 
the other ones. You could tell they 
were mad, but of course you 
couldn't tell what they were saying unless you could read lips. 

Then there were some more 
down by Macy's in the afternoon, 
and a few in Greenwich Village, 
and by evening we had lost count. 
The guesses in the- papers that 
night ran from three hundred to 
a thousand. It was the Times that 
said three hundred. The cops 
didn't give out any estimate at 
all. 

r |iHE next day, there was just 
nothing else at all in the 
papers, or on the radio or TV. 
Bars did an all-time record business. So did churches.

The Mayor appointed a committee to investigate. The Police 
Commissioner called out special 
reserves to handle the mobs. The 
Governor was understood to say 
he was thinking about declaring 
a statewide emergency, but all he 
got in most papers was half a 
column among the ads. Later on 
he denied the whole thing. 

Everybody had to be asked 
what he thought, from Einstein 
to Martin and Lewis. Some people said mass hysteria, some said 
the end of the world, some said 
the Russians. 

Winchell was th£ first one to 
say in print that it was a Martian. I had the same idea myself, 
but by the time I got it all worked 
out I jvas too late to get the 
credit. 

I was handicapped, because all 
this time 1 still hadn't seen one 
of the ghosts yet. I was on Safe, 
Loft and Truck — just promoted 
last spring from a patrolman — 
•nd while I was on duty I never 
got near any of the places where 
they were congregating. In the 
evenings, I had to take care of 
my mother. 

But my brain was working. I 
bad this Martian idea, and I kept 
thinking, thinking, all the time. 

I knew better than to mention 
this to Captain Rifkowicz. All I 
would have to do was mention 
to him that I was thinking, and 



he would say, "With what, Dunlop, with what?" or something 
sarcastic like that. As for asking 
him to get me transferred to Homicide or Missing Persons, where 

I might get assigned to the ghost 
case, that was out. Rifkowicz 
says I should have been kept on 
a beat long enough for my arches 
to fall, in order to leave more 
room on top for brains. 

So I was on my own. And that 
evening, when they started announcing the rewards, I knew I 
had to get that Martian. There 
was fifteen hundred dollars, voted 
by the City Council that afternoon, for whoever would find out 
what was making the ghosts and 
stop it. Because if it didn't stop, 
there would be eighteen thousand 
ghosts in a month, and over two 
hundred thousand in a year. 

Then there was a bunch of 
private rewards, running from 
twenty-five bucks to five hundred, offered by people that had 
relatives among the departed. 
There was a catch to those, 
though — you had to get the relatives back. 

All together, they added up to 
nearly five thousand. With that 
dough, I could afford to hire 
somebody to take care of Ma and 
maybe have some private life of 
my own. There was a cute waitress down on Varick Street, where 
I had lunch every day. For a long 




 



time I had been thinking if I 
asked her to go out, maybe she 
would say yes. But what was the 
use of me asking her, if all I 
could do was have her over to 
listen to Ma talk? All Ma talked 
about was how sick she was and 
how nobody cared. 

FIRST thing I did, I got together all the newspaper stuff 
about the ghosts. I spread it out 
on the living room table and 
sorted it and started pasting it 
into a scrapbook. Right away I 
saw I had to have more information. What was in the papers was 
mostly stories about the crowds 
and the accidents and traffic tieups, plus interviews with people 
that didn't know anything. 

What I wanted to know was — 
what were all these people doing 
when the Martian got them? If 
I knew that, maybe I could figure 
out some kind of a pattern, like 
if the Martian's pet peeve was 
back-slappers, or people who 
make you jump a foot when they 
sneeze, or whatever. 

Another thing, I wanted to 
know all the times and places. 
From that, I could figure out 
what the Martian's habits were, 
if he had any, and with all of it 
together I could maybe arrange 
to be on the spot whenever he 
got sore. Then anybody except 
me who was there evejy time 
would have to be him. 



I explained all this to Ma, 
hoping she would make a sacrifice 
and let me get Mrs. Proctor from 
across the hall to sit with her 
a few evenings. She didn't seem 
to get the idea. Ma never believes anything she reads in the 
papers, anyway, except the 
astrology column. The way it 
struck her, the whole thing was 
some kind of a scheme, like 
gangsters or publicity, and I 
would be better to stay away 
from it. 

I made one more try, talking 
up the money I would get, but all 
she said was, "Well, then why 
don't you just re// that Captain 
Rifkowicz he's got to let you earn 
that reward?" 

Ma has funny ideas about a lot 
of things. She came over here 
from England when she was a 
girl, and it looks like she never 
did get to understand America. I 
knew that if I kept after her, 
she would start crying and telling 
me about all the things she did 
for me when I was a baby. You 
can't argue against that. 

So what I did next, I took the 
bull by the horns. I waited till 
Ma went to sleep and then I just 
walked out and hopped an uptown bus on Seventh Avenue. If 
I couldn't get off during the daytime, I would cut down my sleep 
for a while, that was all. 

I was heading for Times 
Square, but at Twenty -seventh I

saw a crowd on the sidewalk. I 
,got out and ran over there. Sure 
enough, in the middle of the 
crowd was two of the ghosts, a 
fat man with a soupstrainer mustache and a skinny woman with 
cherries on her hat. You could 
tell they were ghosts because the 
people were waving their hands 
through them. Aside from that, 
there was no difference. 

I took the lady first, to be 
polite. I flashed the badge, and 
then I hauled out my notebook 
and wrote, "Name and address 
please," and shoved it at her. 

She got the idea and looked 
through her bag for a pencil and 
an envelope. She scribbled, "Mrs. 
Walter F. Walters, Schenectady, 
N. Y." 

tasked her, "When did this 
happen to you and where?" 

She wrote it was about one P.M. 
the afternoon before, and she 
was in Schrafft's on "Broadway 
near 37th, eating lunch with her 
husband. I asked her if the fat 
man was her husband, and she 
said he was. 

I then asked her if she could 
remember exactly what the two 
of them were doing right at the 
moment when it happened. She 
thought a while and then said 
she was talking and her husband 
was dunking his doughnut in his 
coffee. I asked her if it was the 
kind with powdered sugar and 
she said yes. 



t knew then that I was on the 
right track. She was one of those 
little women with big jaws that 
generally seem to have loud 
voices and like to use them; and 
I always hated people who dunk 
those kind of doughnuts, myself. 
The powdered sugar gets wet and 
gluey and the dunkers have to 
lick their fingers right in public. 

I thanked them and went on 
uptown. When I got back home 
that night, about four a. m. the 
next morning, I had fifteen interviews in my book. The incidents 
had taken place all over the midtown area. Six got theirs for talking, four on crowded sidewalks 
— probably for jostling or stepping on corns — two for yelling on 
a quiet street at two in the morning, one for dunking, one for 
singing to himself on a subway, 
one, judging by the look of him, 
for not being washed, and one 
for coming in late to a Broadway 
play. The six talkers broke down 
to three in restaurants, two in a 
newsreel movie, and one in Carnegie Hall while a concert was 
going on. 

Nobody remembered who they 
were next to at the time, but I 
was greatly encouraged. I had a 
hunch I was getting somewhere 
already. 

¥ GOT through the next day, 
■*■ the eighth, in a kind of daze, 
and don't think Rifkowicz didn't 




 




CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



call my attention to it. I suppose 
I wasn't worth more than a nickel 
to the City that day, but I promised myself I would make it up 
later. For the moment, I ignored 
Rifkowicz. 

On the radio and TV, there 
were two new developments. In 
my head, there was one. 

First, the radio and TV. I ate 
lunch in a saloon so as to catch 
the latest news, even though I 
had to give up my daily glimpse 
of the waitress in the beanery. 
Two things were new. One, people 
had started noticing that a few 
things had turned into ghosts — 
besides people, I mean. Things 
like a barrel organ, and an automobile that had its horn stuck, 
and like that. 

TL^t made things twice as bad, 
of course, because anybody was 
liable to try to touch one of these 
ghost things and jump to the 
conclusion they were a ghost, 
themselves. 

Two, the TV reporters were interviewing the ghosts, the same 
way I did, with paper and pencil. 
I picked up four more sets of 
questions and answers just while 
I was eating lunch. 

The ghosts came over fine on 
TV, by the way. Somehow it 
looked even creepier on the 
screen, when you saw somebody's 
hand disappear into them, than 
it did when you saw it with your 
own eyes. 



The development in my head 
was like this. Out of the fifteen 
cases I already had, and the four 
I got from TV, there were eight 
that happened on the street or in 
subways or buses, five in restaurants, and six in places 
of entertainment. Four different 
places of entertainment. Now, at 
first glance, that may not look 
like it means much. But I said 
to myself, "What does this Martian do? He travels around from 
one place to another — that's normal. He eats — that's normal. But 
he goes to four different shows 
that I know about in three days 
— and I know just nineteen cases 
out of maybe a thousand!** 

It all fitted together. Here is 
this Martian. He's never been 
here before. We know that because he just now started making 
trouble. The way I see it, these 
Martians look us over for a while 
from a distance, and then they 
decide to send one Martian down 
to New York to study us close 
up. Well, what's the first thing 
he does, being that he wants to 
find out all about us? He goes 
to the movies. And concerts and 
stage plays too, of course, because he wants to try everything 
once. But probably he sees two 
or three double features a day. 
It stands to reason. 

So there he is in the movie, 
watching and listening so he 
shouldn't miss anything impor



 



tent, and some customer around 
him starts making loud comments 
to somebody else,, rattling cellophane, and snapping a pocketbook open and shut every five 
seconds to find akleenex. So he 
flips them into the next dimension, where they can make all 
the noise they want without bothering him. 

And that's the reason why there 
arc so many ghosts that got 
theirs in the movies and places 
like that. On the streets of any 
city you can walk for miles without running into more than two 
or three really obnoxious characters, but in any kind of a theater 
there's always somebody talking, 
or coughing, or rattling paper. 
You've noticed that. 

I went even further than that. 
I checked with my notes and 
then looked in a copy of Cue 
magazine to find out what was 
playing at each of those theaters 
when the Martian was there. 

I found out that the play was 
a long-run musical — the concert 
was musical, naturally — and one 
of the two movies was a Hollywood remake of a musical comedy. The other was a newsreel. 

There it was. I as good as had 
him. Then I got another idea and 
went back through my notes to 
find out where the theater victims had been sitting. The guy 
in Carnegie Hall had been in the 
balcony; that's where you hear 



best. I guess. But the other five 
had all been sitting down front, 
in the first four rows. 

The little giiy was nearsighted. 

That's the way I was thinking 
about him now — a little nearsighted guy who liked music better than Westerns, and was used 
to some place where everybody's 
careful not to bother anybody 
else. It was hard not to feel 
sorry for him ; after all, some 
people that come from places 
closer than Mars have a hard 
time in New York. 

But it was me against him. 
That night the total rewards were 
up to almost twenty thousand 
dollars. 

T THOUGHT of one thing I 
could do right away. I could 
write to the Mayor to make an 
announcement that if people 
didn't want to be ghosts, they 
should keep from making unnecessary noise or being pests, especially in theaters. But one, he 
probably wouldn't pay any attention to me, and two, if he did, 
twenty thousand other guys 
would be following my lead before I could turn around, and one 
of them would probably catch the 
Martian before I did. 

That night, I did the same as 
before. I waited till Ma was 
sleeping, then went out to a movie 
on Broadway. It was a first-run 
house, they bad a musical play


CATCH THAT MARTI AN

ing, and I sat down front. 

But nothing happened. The 
Martian wasn't there. 

I felt pretty discouraged when 
I got home. My time was running 
out and there are over three hundred theaters in Manhattan. I 
had to start working faster. 

I lay awake for a long while, 
worrying and thinking about it, 
and finally I came to one of the 
most important decisions in my 
life. The next morning I was going to do something I never did 
before — call in and pretend like 
I was sick. And I was going to 
stay sick until I found the Martian. 

I felt bad about it and I felt 
even worse in the morning, when 
Rifkowicz told me to take it easy 
till Wgot welt. 

After breakfast. I got the 
papers and made a list of shows 
on my way uptown. I went to 
one on 42nd Street first — it was 
a musical picture about some 
composer named Handle, and the 
second feature was a comedy, but 
it had Hoagy Carmichael in it. 
so I figured I should stay for that 
too. I sat in the fifth row. There 
was plenty of coughing going on, 
only nobody got turned into a 
ghost. 

Then I had lunch and went to 
another musical, on Broadway. 
I drew another blank. 

My eyes were beginning to 
bother me a little from sitting so 



close to the screen, so I thought 
I would just go to a newsreel 
movie and then walk around a 
while before dinner. But when I 
got out of the newsreel I began 
to feel jittery, and I went straight 
to another double feature. The 
Martian wasn't there, either. 

I had seen plenty of ghosts 
standing around on the streets, 
but they were all just standing 
there looking kind of lost and 
bewildered, the way they did 
after a while. You could tell a 
new victim because he would be 
rushing here and there, shoving 
his hands through things, trying 
to talk to people, and acting all 
upset. 

One thing I forgot to mention. 
Everybody was wondering now 
how these ghosts got along without eating. In this dimension 
where they wer ? e, there wasn't any 
food — there wasn't anything, just 
thv stuff like rubbery clouds that 
they were standing on. But they 
all claimed they weren't hungry 
or thirsty, and they all seemed to 
be in good shape. Even the ones 
that had been ghosts now for 
four days. 

When I got out of that last 
movie, tt was about eight in the 
evening. I was feeling low in my 
mind, but I still had a healthy 
appetite. I started wandering 
around the side streets of Broadway, looking for a restaurant that 
wasn't too crowded or too ex

pensive. I passed a theater that 
was on my list, except I knew I 
was too late to get a ticket for it. 
It was the premiere of the newest 
Rodgers and Hammerstein show, 
and the lobby and half the sidewalk were full of customers. 

I went on past, feeling gloomier 
because of all the bright lights 
and excitement, and then I heard 
something funny. Without paying 
any attention, I had been listening to one of these raspy-voiced 
barkers inside the lobby going, 
"GETcha program here." Now, 
all of a sudden, he said^ "GETch — " and stopped. 

I turned around, with a funny 
prickling up the back of my 
spine. The voice didn't start up 
again. Just as I started back toward the lobby, a ghost came out 
of the crowd. There was no doubt 
about him being a ghost — he ran 
through people. 

He had a bunch of big booklets 
with slick covers under his arm, 
and his mouth was wide open 
like he was shouting. Then he 
showed his teeth, and his face 
got all red, and he lifted the booklets in both hands and threw 
them away as hard as he could. 
They went through people, too. 

The ghost walked away with 
his hands shoved into his pockets. 

TJUNNING into that lobby, I 
shoved my badge at the 
ticket taker, and told him to find 



me the manager, quick. 

When the manager came up I 
grabbed him by the Ispels and 
said, "1 got reason to believe 
there's a dangerous criminal going 
to be in this audience tonight. 
With your cooperation, we'll get 
him." He looked worried, so I 
said, "There won't be any trouble. 
You just put me where I can see 
the front rows and leave the rest 
to me." 

He said, "I can't give you & 
seat. The house is completely sold 
out." 

I told him, "Okay, put me back 
in the wings, or whatever you 
call them." 

He argued, but he did what 1 
asked. We went down the side 
aisle, through the orchestra pit 
and through a little door that 
went under the stage. Then we 
went up a little stairway to backstage, and he put me right at the 
edge of the stage, up front, where 
I could peek out at the audience. 

There was a crowd of people 
running around back there behind 
the curtains, actors and chorus 
girls, guys in their shirt sleeves 
and guys in overalls. I could hear 
the hum out front — people were 
beginning to fill the seats — and I 
wanted that curtain to go up. I 
just couldn't wait. 

Finally the actors took their 
places, and the band suddenly 
started playing, and the curtain 
went up. 



CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



T understand that show Is still 
playing to standing room only, 
even with all the trouble that's 
happened since then, but 1 didn't 
pay any attention to it and I 
couldn't even tell you what it was 
about. I was watching the front 
four rows, trying to memorize 
every face I saw. 

Right in the middle there were 
three that I paid more attention 
to than the rest. One of them was 
a young blonde girl with blue 
eyes like the color of Ma's fancy 
china that she brought with, her 
from the old country. Another 
was an old gent with chin spinach 
and glasses on a string. The third 
was a little guy with a sour expression and a derby hat. 

l^don't know why I picked out 
those three, except maybe it was 
a hunch. Maybe I was looking 
at the blonde girl just because 
she was pretty, but then again, I 
never saw eyes that color before 
or since. It could be that Martians have china-blue eyes; how 
would I know? I might have had 
some wild idea that the old guy 
could be the Martian and was 
wearing the frizzy white whiskers 
because Martians don't have 
chins exactly like us. And I think 
I picked on the little guy because 
he fitted the picture I already had 
in my head. And the way he was 
clutching that derby in his lap, 
like it was made of gold — I was 
thinking to myself, maybe he's 



got some kind of ray gun built 

into that hat; maybe that's how 
he does it. 

T ADMIT that I wasn't thinking very logical — I was too 
excited — but I never took my 
eyes off that . audience for a 
second. 

I was waiting for somebody to 
start coughing or sneezing and 
get turned into a ghost. When 
that happened, I would be watching the people, and if I was 
lucky I might see who was looking at the victim when it happened. 

That's what I was waiting for. 
What I got was a sniff of smoke 
and then somebody started 
screaming and yelling, "Fire!" 

Half the audience was on their 
feet in a second. I looked up, 
and sure enough there was smoke 
pouring out at the back of 
the room. Some more women 
screamed and the stampede was 
on. 

The gi rls on sta ge stopped 
dancing and the band stopped 
playing. Somebody — some actor 
— ran out on the stage and started 
saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, 
your attention please. Walk, do 
not run, to the nearest exit. There 
is no danger. Walk, do not run — " 
I lost my head. Not on account 
. of the fire. I knew the actor was 
right and the only bad thing that 
could happen would be people 



96 




 



trampling each other to death to 
get out of there. But the seats 
were emptying fast and it struck 
me all of a sudden that I didn't 
know my way through that tangle 
of scenery backstage. By the time 
I got down the stairs and out into 
the auditorium, the Martian 
might be gone. 

I felt cold all over. I didn't even 
stop to remember that I didn't 
have to go back the way I came, 
because there were little steps 
right at the side of the stage. I 
ran out from behind the wings 
and started to jump over the 
musicians. At that, I would have 
made it if I hadn't caught my toe 
in that little trough where the 
footlights are. 

I had worse luck than that, 
even. I landed smack in the middle of the bass drum. 

You never heard such a noise 
in your life. It sounded as if the 
ceiling caved in. Sitting there, 
with my legs and arms sticking 
out of that drum, I saw the people turn around and look at me 
like they had been shot. I saw 
them all, the girl with the chinablue eyes, the old' gent with the 
whiskers, the little guy with the 
derby, and a lot more. And then, 
suddenly, all the sound stopped, 
game as when you turn off a 
radio. 

The guy who owned the drum 
leaned over and tried to pull me 
out of it. He couldn't. 



His hands went right through 
me. 

T IKE I said, this Martian annoys easy. I dont know what 
he did about all those women 
screaming — maybe he figured 
there was a good reason for that 
and left them alone. But when I 
hit that bass drum, it must have 
burned him good. You know, 
when you're excited already, a 
loud noise will make you jump 
twice as far. 

That's about the only satisfaction I got — that I probably annoyed him the worst of anybody 
in New York City. 

That and being so close to 
catching him. 

The company here is nothing to 
brag about — women that will 
talk your arm off and half your 
shoulder, and guys that say, 
"Peaceful enough for you?" and 
back-slappers, and people that 
hum to themselves — 

Besides that, the place is so 
damned dull. Clouds to stand on, 
nothing to eat even if you wanted 
to eat, and nothing to do except 
stand around and watch the new 
ones come through. We can't even 
* see much of New York any more, 
because it keeps getting mistier 
all the time — fading away, kind 
of, like maybe this dimension is 
getting a little farther away from 
the ordinary one every day. 

I asked Mr. Dauth yesterday 



CATCH THAT MARTIAN 



9t 



hew he thought the whole thing 

would wind up. Mr. Dauth isn't 
bad. He's a big, cheerful guy, 
about fifty. The kind that likes 
good food and good beer and a 
lot of it. But he doesn't complain. 
He admits that his habit of sucking his teeth out real loud is aggravating and says maybe he deserved what he got, which you'll 
admit is big of him. So I talk 
to him a lot, and the other day, 
when we were watching a new 
batch that had just come through, 
I asked him where Ke thought it 
would all end, because we can 
hear each other, you see, being 
in the same dimension. 

He pursed his lips and frowned 
like he was thinking it over, and 
then said that as far as he could 
Me, there wasn't any human be


ing that was perfect. Anybody is 
liable to do something aggravating sooner or later. That's the 
way people are. 

"And this Martian of yours 
seems to be thorough," he said. 
"Very thorough. It might take 
him years to get through studying 
the Earth." 

"And then what?" I asked him. 

"Well," he said, "eventually, 
if he keeps it up long enough, 
we'll all be over here." 

I hope he's right. Now that I 
come to think of it, that cute 
waitress I mentioned has a habit 
of setting down a coffee cup so 
half of it slops into the saucer. If 
Mr. Dauth is right, all I've got 
to do is wait. 

It stands to reason.

By ALFRED BESTER 



At each step, Reich defeated the Fsper sleuth, 
but therm was a peeper trick left — th* biggest 
and the most daring - and the deadliest of atU 



SYNOPSTS 

When telepathy emerged as an 

extracted recessive characteristic, 
possessors ot extra-sensory per~ 
ception became valuable members 
ot society. In addition to having 
the skills of their chosen trades 
or professions, Espers were able 
to probe the mind for unknown 



or concealed meanings. They belonged to the Esper Guild, were 
known as "peepers" and were 
divided into classes according to 
their ability to penetrate the 
mind : 3rds could peep the conscious; 2nds dug past that to th» 
preconscious and subconscious; 
while Ists, the elite of the Guild, 
could explore every crevice of the

deeply buried unconscious. 

Because of Espers, premeditated murder was impossible. 
Telepathe could peep the intent 
of m killer before the crime, or 
peep the evidence needed for conviction after it. No slayer had 
escaped the dreaded Demolition 
Chamber in Kingston Hospital 
in 70 years. 

Despite this, Ben Reich, piratical owner of Sacrament, Inc., 
was driven by a recurrent nightmare about a Man With No Face 
to plan the murder of his bitter 
commercial rival, Craye D'Cou/fney, of the D' Courtney Cartel on 
Mars, to end the economic war. 

With the aid of Augustus TS, 
E.M.D.l (Esper Medical Doctor 
1st class) and Jerry Church, a 
2nd^class peeper ostracized from 
the Guild, Reich went to a party 
at Maria Beaumont's mansion. 
In the course of an ancient game 
called "Sardine," Reich slipped 
Up to the hidden suite of D' Courtney and murdered him. The killing was unexpectedly witnessed 
by D'Courtney's daughter, Barbara, who ran from the house in 
hysterical terror with the murder 
weapon, and mysteriously disappeared. 

The murder investigation was 
handled by Preston Powell, the 
police department's Prefect of the 
Psychotic Division, a 1st, deadly 
for his ability to pry into the 
unconscious. Powell discovered 
telepathically that Reich was the 



murderer, but courts of law would 
not accept peeper evidence* Powell had to obtain objective proof 
to bring Reich to Demolition. 

Powell swiftly learned that 
Reich had purchased and presented an antique game book to 
Maria Beaumont from which she 
got the "Sardine" game that enabled Reich to attack D'Courtney . . . that Reich had picked 
up a devilishly repetitive song 
from Duffy Wyg&, a psych-song 
writer, and used it to block peeping . . . that the Rhodopsin Ionizer 
with which Reich immobilized 
D'Courtney's guards had been developed for Sacrament, Inc., by 
Dr. Wilson %maine. 

At almost the same moment, 
Reich's underworld network and 
Powell's Esper grapevine located 
the missing Barbara D'Couiiney i 
in a slum Frab Joint. In a hectic 
race through the maze of the 
joint, Reich managed to unearth the knife-pistol with the 
blank cartridges which blew out 
D'Courtney's brains. Although he 
and Powell were hidden from each 
other, they located Barbara 
D' Courtney simultaneously. Reich 
remained concealed while Powell talked to the girl She wa9 
suffering from hysterical recall 
and could relive only the scene of 
her father s death each time she 
heard the trigger word "Help." 
As Powell led the girl away, Reich 
tried to shoot them. He could not 
force himself to do so.

Taken to Powell's house, Barbara was given the Deja Eprouve 
treatment to bring her out of 
catatonia. This treatment would 
return her to the moment of birth 
and enable her to "grow up" again 
at an accelerated tempo that took 
four weeks, when she would be 
able to face the horror that her 
conscious mind was struggling to 
reject. 

While she went through infancy, Powell learned, by peeping 
her memory of the murder, that 
Craye D'Courtney did not resist 
Reich's attack. Powell consulted 
Sam @kim, D'Courtney's Esper 
Analyst 1, and found- that 
D' Courtney was on the verge of 
suicide, the result of guilt feelings 
because of the abandonment of 
his child. Powell also discovered 
that Augustus T8 had broken the 
Guild Pledge and was Retch'saccessory. 

Realizing that the murder 
weapon might have been bought 
at Jerry Church's pawnshop, 
Powell tricked TB into meeting 
him there to reveal the truth 
about the knife-pistol. Church refused to talk but T8, shaken by 
threat of exile from the Guild, 
confessed all he knew about 
Reich's offer to merge with 
D'Courtney, the code refusal, and 
the nightmares about the Man 
With No Face which goaded 
Reich into the murder. 

A sudden attack by the goons 
of Keno Quizzard, Reich's blind 



underworld lieutenant, resulted 
in the death of TS. Church, 
shocked by the brutal assault 
that might also have kilted him 
hastily told Powell that Reich[ 
had bought the knife-pistol whicf^ 
killed D'Courtney — but Reicfy 
had first removed the bullets frot^ 
the cartridges. 

With opportunity and methorj 
of killing taking shape, Powell 
rushed home to clear up the cwj, 
ous point about D' Courtney' a 
strange idea that he had abar>, 
doned his child. Powell peepe$ 
Barbara, who by now had acf. 
vanced to the toddler stage. Pens, 
trating deep into her unconscious 
he learned to his dismay that th$ 
girl was falling in love with hi'n^ 
Mary Noyes, Powell's c/o^ 
friend, who was in love with hijj, 
herself, bitterly informed Powe// 
that he was falling in love with 
Barbara, too, and was unaware 
of it. The Esper Guild demanded 
that Espers marry Espers, ar\<j 
Barbara was not even sane, /«£ 
alone a peeper. What did Powell 
intend to do about it? 
1 Before the startled Powell 
could find an answer, word canr )9 
that Ben Reich's code chief 
Hassop, who had in his possession 
Sacrament's vital financial rec. 
ords which could prove Reich'$ 
financial motive for the murder t 
had disappeared from AmprQ 
where he had been hidden bp 
Reich. Powell had to take a space. 
ship for Ampro at once. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



XIII 

AS the Ampro Queen ponder ously circled the hodgeJ » podge in space that was 
the amusement center of the Solar 
System (Ampro — Amusement 
Protectorate) and the unofficial 
neutral territory, the ventral 
hatch opened and dozens of landing launches swept up through 
space to lodge inside her belly. 
Then the hatch closed, the central staging hall was refilled with 
air, and the passengers permitted 

104 



to enter from the- ships' ramps. 

The staging hall was a domed 
cavern, five hundred feet long, a 
hundred wide and fifty feet to the 
peak. You carried your luggage 
from your stateroom down to the 
staging hall . . . and that was 
the beginning of the wild frenzy 
of your vacation at Ampro. 

Thirty launches with crystal 
sightseeing ports rested on the 
floor. They were painted in garish 
colors and each prominently displayed the name of the hotel 
that had sent it. The smaller ho

 



tels had to be content with single 
barkers, but the more prosperous 
establishments sent entire acts. 
On top of the Victoria launch, 
for example, was a troupe of 
trampoline acrobats in violent 
free-flight. The Victoria catered 
to a muscle clientele. The Magic 
launffh had sixteen lovely mermaids droning deafeningly on 
harps. The Sportsman displayed 
an energetic clown in ludicrous 
cap, sweater and plus-fours who 
putted small white balls to the 
tourists. Each ball was a sphere 
of soft plastic which spoke in a 
faint, tinny, voice; "For the best 
in sports, come to the Sportsman. 
Sovereign a day for single, and 
up." 

Powell threaded his way 
through the crowds and entered 
the small black police launch. 
Sergeant Al Bible was waiting 
despondently for him. 

"We loused it," Bible said. 

A warning bell clanged. The 
launch sealed up and, as the 
ventral hatch opened, it dropped 
into space. Powell glanced out 
of the port at Ampro glittering 
below like a patchwork quilt 
worked in silver and gilt. 

Ampro had started generations 
back with a flat plate of meteoric 
rock half a mile in diameter. A 
health cultist had raised a transparent hemisphere of Air-Gel on 
the plate, installed an atmosphere 
generator and started a colony. 
From that, Ampro had grown into 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



an irregular table in space, extending hundreds of miles. Each 
new entrepreneur had simply 
tacked another mile or so onto 
the shelf, raised his own transparent hemisphere and gone into 
business. By the time engineers 
got around to advising Ampro 
that the spherical form was more 
efficient and economical, it was 
too late to change. The table just 
went on adding new hemisphf-res 
like a mass of giant soap bubbles 
on a bright checkerboard. 

The various planetary and 
satellitic colonies attempted to 
reproduce the environments of 
their homes. "Mars From Home" 
was reddish and wasted, but with 
the added luxury of lakes of blue 
water. "Venus From Home" was 
misty. On the Jupiter side of the 
table was the giant hundred mile 
hemisphere that covered the 
Ampro Nature Reservation which 
guaranteed more natural history 
and weather per square mile than 
any planet. 

"Let's have the story, Al," Powell said. 

Bible gulped. "We followed instructions. Rough tail on Hassop, 
slickie following him. The rough 
got taken out by Reich's girl . . " 

"It was a girl, eh?" 

"Cute little trick named Duffy 
Wyg&." 

Powell jerked upright. "Why, 
I questioned that girl myself! I 
never — " He caught himself and 
shook his head. "Seems I dfd 

105 



some lousing myself, Al. Shows 
you when you meet a pretty girl, 
- look out!" 

"Well, like I say," Bible continued, "she takes out the rough, 
and just when the slickie moves 
in. Reich jets into Arnpro with a 
commotion." 

"Lilft?" 

"Private yacht. Has a crash in 
space and limps in hollerin* 
emergency. One killed. Three injured, including Reich. Front of 
the yacht stove in. Derelict or 
meteor stray. They take Reich 
to the hospital where we figure 
he's planted for a little. When 
we turn around, Reich's gone. 
Hassop too. I grab a peeper interpreter and go looking in four 
Solar languages. No dice." 
v'Hassop's luggage?" 
Gone likewise." 

"Damnation ! We've got to 
pinch Hassop and that luggage, 
Al. They're our motive. Hassop 
is Sacrament's Code : Chief. We 
need him for that last message 
Reich sent to D'Courtney and the 
reply ..." 

"Monday before the murder?" 

"Yes. That exchange probably 
ignited the killing. And Hassop's 
got Reich's financial records with 
him. They can probably tell a 
court why Reich had a hell of a 
motive for murdering D'Courtney." 

"Such as?" ... 

"The talk around Sacrament is 
that D'Courtney had Reich with 



his back clear against the wall." 

"You find method and opportunity?" 

"Yes and no. I opened up 
Jerry Clyurch and got everything, 
but it's ticklish. We can show 
Reich had the opportunity. We 
can show the murder method. 
Same goes for Reich's nmtive. 
But they're like three wigwam 
poles — each stands if the other 
two do. That's Mr. Peetcy's 
opinion. And that's why we need 
Hassop." 

"I'll swear they ain't left 
Ampro. That efficient I still am." 

"Don't hang your head because 
Reich outsmarted you. He's outsmarted plenty. Me included." 

Bible shook his head gloomily. 

"I'll start peeping Ampro for 
Reich and Hassop at once," Powell said as the launch drifted 
down for the passage through the 
airlock, "but I want to check a 
hunch first. Show me the corpse." 

"What corpse?" 

"From Reich's crash." 

In the police mortuary, displayed on an air-cushion in the 
stasis -freeze, the corpse was a 
mangled figure with dead white 
skin and a flaming red beard. 

"Uh-huh," Powell muttered. 
"Keno Quizzard." 

"You know him?" 

"A gimpster. Was working for 
Reich and turned too fiot to be 
useful. What'll you bet that crash 
was a cover-up for a killing?" 

"Hell !" Bible exploded. "Those

two other guys are hurt bad and 

the yacht was ruined!" 

"So they were hurt and the 
yacht was ruined. So what? Quizzard's mouth is shut for keeps 
and Reich's that much safer. A 
cheap price for Reich to pay. It 
was a phony, A I. We started 
Quizzard running. Reich intercepted and took care of him. We'll 
never prove it, but we won't have 
to if we locate Hassop. That'll 
be enough to walk friend Reich 
into the Demolition Chamber.**

Discouraged, Powell dropped 
into Solar Dawn Cemetery for a

food laugh. The cemetery looked 
like an English garden, all flagged 
paths and trees with tiny little 
plots of green grass. Muted music 
from robot quartets, made up as 
musical greats of the past. 
Beethoven, Tchaikowsky, Palestrina and Bix Beiderbeck incongruously under one roof, 
Armstrongs Caruso, Wagner and 
Florence Foster Jenkins under 
another. Powell began to smile. 

There was an accurate reproduction of the Notre Dame Cathedral in the center of the cemetery. From the mouth of on? of 
the gargoyles in the tower, a 
syrupy voice roared : "See the 
drama of the gods portrayed in 
vibrant robot-action! Moses on 
Mt. Sinai, the Crucifixion of 
Christ, Mohammed and the 
mountain, Lao Tse and the Moon, 
the Revelation of Mary Baker 
Eddy, the Ascension of our Lord 
Buddha, the Unveiling of the 
true and only god Galaxy ..." 
Pause, and then a little more 
matter -of -factly: "Owing to the 
sacred nature of this exhibit, admission is by ticket only. Tickets 
may be purchased from the Bailiff." A click, and another gargoyle 
began in another language. Powell's smile turned to a grin. 

Each of the green plots contained a crystal panel ten feet 
square, the ceiling of a stasis 
room in which the departed were 
displayed to eternity in their pet 
poses amid their favorite sur
W 



foundings. In a boudoir, a loved 
one primped motionlessly before 
m mirror. In a monkish library, a 
bibliophile held a book open 
while he jotted down a marginal 
notation. An amateur pilot swaggered grimly on the bridge of a 
rocket ship. A nature-lover communed with nature. Powell 
laughed. 

"You ought to be ashamed of 
yourself," a girl said behind him. 

Without turning, Powell replied: "I'm sorry. 'No Loud Talking or Laughter.' But don't you 
think this is the most ludicrous 
display of vanity in — " Then the 
pattern of her psyche hit him and 
he spun around. 

"Well, Duffy!" he said. 
Her frown changed to a quick 
■mUe. "Mr. Powell, the boysleuth. You still owe mc a dance." 

"I owe you an apology," Powell said. 

"Delighted. Can't have enough 
of them. What's this one for?" 
"Underestimating you." 
"The story of my life." She 
linked arms and drew him along 
the path. "You took another look 
at me and — ?" 

"I realized you're the cleverest 
person Ben Reich has working 
for him." 

"I am clever. I did do some 
work for Ben. Well?" 

"You took out the tail we had 
on Hassop, Duff y . Congratula tions." 

Her pert face looked up at him, 



half serious, half amused. "What 
in hell are you talking about?" 

"We had a tail on Hassop. A 
tail is a secret agent assigned to 
the duty of following a suspect." 

"Contents noted. What's a 
Hassop?" 

"A man who works for Ben 
Reich. His Code Chief." 

"And what did I do to your 
spy?" 

"Following instructions from 
Ben Reich, you captivated the 
man, turned him into a derelict 
from duty, kept him at a piano 
day after day — " 

"Wait a minute!" Duffy said 
sharply. "The little goon was a 
cop?" 

"He was." 

"Following this Hassop?" 
"Yes." 

"Hassop . . . Bleached man? 
Dusty hair? Dusty blue eyes?'" 
Powell nodded. 

"The louse," Duffy muttered. 
"And you think I'm the kind 
that does his dirty work, don't 
you! Why, you — you peeper! I 
make enough money to keep 
peepers! Reich asked me to do 
him a favor. Said there was a 
man up here working on an interesting musical code. Wanted 
me to check him. How was \ 
supposed to know it was your 
goon masquerading as a musician?" 

Powell stared at her. "Are you 
claiming that Reich tricked you?" 
She glared back. "Go ahead 




 



and peep me. I| Reich wasn't in 
the Reservation, you could peep 
that doublecrossing — " 

"Hold it!" Powell interrupted 
sharply. He peeped her precisely 
and comprehensively, then turned 
and began to run. 

"Hey!" Duffy yelled. "What's 
the verdict?" 

"Medal of Honor," Powell 
called over his shoulder. "I'll pin 
it on as soon as I bring a man 
back alive." 

"I don't want a man. I want 
you." 

"That's your trouble, Duffy. 
You want anybody." 
"Who?" 
"An-y-bod-y." 

"No loud talking or laughter, 
please!" 

T>OWELL found Sergeant Bible 
* in the Ampro Globe Theater 
where Diana Clerisy, the magnificent Esper actress, stirred 
thousands with her performances. 
Bible, immune to Miss Clerisy's 
appeal, was gloomily inspecting 
the house face by face. Powell 
took his arm and led him out. 

"He's in the Reservation," 
Powell said. "Took Hassop with 
him. Took Hassop's luggage, too. 
Perfect alibi. He was shaken up 
by the crash and he needs a rest. 
Also company. He's eight hours 
ahead of us." 

"The Reservation, huh?" Bible 
pondered. "Two hundred and 
fifty square miles of more damned 



animals, geography and weather 
than anywhere else." 

"If we want to get Hassop out, 
we'll have to grab a helio and do 
some fast hunting." 

"No mechanical transportation 
allowed in the Reservation." 

"This is an emergency! Peetcy'a 
got to have Hassop!" 

"Let Peetcy argue with the 
Ampro Board. You could get special permission in maybe threefour weeks." 

"By which time Hassop'd be 
dead and buried. What about 
radar or sonar? We could work 
out Hassop's pattern and — " 

"No devices outside of cameras. You hike on your own feet. 
You carry your own food. You 
take one Defensive Barrier Screen 
with you so's the animals don't 
eat you. If you want a fire, you 
got to bujld it. If you want to 
hunt, you got to make your own 
weapons. You versus nature. And 
they make you sign a release in 
case nature wins." 

"Then how are we going to 
find Hassop?" 

"Sign a release and go hike 
for him." 

"The two of us? Cover 250 
square miles of geography? How 
many cops can you spare?" 

"Maybe ten." 

"Twenty-five square miles per 
cop. Impossible." 

"Maybe you could persuade 
the Ampro Board — No. Even if 
you could, we wouldn't be able

lot 



to get them together in less than 
a week. Could you get 'em together by maybe peeping 'em?" 

"We can't transmit to anybody 
except another peeper, so — Hey! 
That's an idea. Is a human being 
a rr> r ~hanical device?" 

"?'nt lately." 

"Then I'm going to do some 
fast co-opting and take my own 
radar into the Reservation." 

WHICH is why a sudden craving for nature overtook a 
prominent lawyer in the midst of 
delicate contractual negotiations 
in one of Ampro's luxurious conference rooms. The same craving 
also came upon the secretary of a 
famous author, a judge of domestic relations, a job analyst 
screwing applicants • for the 
United Hotel Association, an industrial designer, an efficiency 
engineer, the chairman of< Amalgamated Union's Grievance Committee, Titan's superintendent of 
cybernetics, a secretary of political 
psychology, two Cabinet members, five Parliamentary leaders, 
and scores of other Esper clients 
of Ampro at work and at play. 

They filed through the Reservation gate in a unified mood of 
holiday festivity and assorted 
clothes. Those that had gotten 
word on the grapevine early 
enough were in sturdy camping 
clothes. Others were not; and the 
astonished gate guards, checking 
and inspecting for illicit baggage. 



saw one lunatic in full diplomatic 
panoply march through with a 
pack on his back. But all the 
nature-lovers carried detailed 
maps of the Reservation carefully 
zoned into sectors." 

Moving swiftly, they spread 
out and beat forward across the 
miniature cosmos of weather and 
geography. The Telepathic Band 
crackled as comments and information swept up and back the 
line of living radar in which Powell occupied the central position. 

"Snowing here. Full blizzard." 

"Swamps and (.Ugh!) mosquitoes my way." 

"Does anyone know what a 
rattlesnake looks like?" 

"Don't bite it, your honor." 

"More damn nature ..." 

"Party ahead, Pres. Sector 9." 

"Let's have the picture" 

"Here it comes . . " 

"No sale,"

"Don't run! Negotiate!" 

"Say, V ve got a lake dead

"There's no lake in your sector,

"Excuse it, please. Just a

The departing peepers were 
propelled by a tiger grin. 

HPHIS particular square mile of 
Reservation was jungle, 
swampy, tangled, humid. As 
darkness fell, Powell slowly 
wormed his way toward the glimmering campfixe Reich had built 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



111 



in a clearing alongside a small 
lake. The water was infested with 
hippo, crocodile and swambat. 
The trees and terrain swarmed 
with life. The entire jungle was a 
savage tribute to the brilliance 
of Reservation ecologists who 
could assemble and balance nature on the point of. a pin. In 
tribute to that nature, Reich's 
Defensive Barrier Screen was in 
full operation. 

Powell could hear mosquitoes 
whine as they batted against the 
barrier. He could not risk operating his own, for the screens 
hummed slightly and Reich had 
keen ears. Powell inched forward 
and peeped. * 

Hassop was beglamored by being with Reich. Reich, working 
^feverishly on a crude, powerful 
bow. was passionately planning 
the accident that would take him 
a little further from Demolition. 
It was that bow and the arrows 
that had eaten up the eight hour 
start on Powell. You can't kilt a 
man in a hunting accident unless 
you go hunting. 

As Reich lifted the bow, his 
eyes carefully averted from Hassop, his mind intent on the throbbing heart that was his target, 
Powell drove forward urgently. 
Before he had moved ten feet, 
alarm tripped in Reich's mind 
and the big man was on his feet. 
He whipped a burning branch 
from the fire and hurled the flare 
toward the blackness where Pow


ell was concealed. The idea and 
execution came so quickly that 
Powell could not anticipate the 
action. He would have been fully 
illumined if Reich had not forgotten the barrier. It stopped the 
flaming branch in mid-flight and 
dropped it to the ground. 

"Christ!** Reich cried, and 
swung around abruptly at 
Hassop. 

"What is it, Ben?" 

Reich drew the arrow back to 
the lobe of his ear and held the 
point on Hassop's body. Hassop 
scrambled to his feet. 

"Ben, watch out! You're aiming at me!" 

Hassop leaped to one side unexpectedly as Reich let the arrow 

fly. 

"Ben! For the love of — " Suddenly Hassop realized the intent. 
Running desperately, he smashed 
into the invisible wall as an arrow shot past his shoulder and 
shattered. 

"Ben!" he screamed. 

"You son of a bitch,** Reich 
growled, and notched another 
shaft. 

Powell leaped forward and 
reached the edge of the barrier. 
He could not pass it. Inside, Hassop ran screaming while Reich 
stalked him. 

Powell stepped back into the 
darkness, thinking desperately. 
Hassop's screams had aroused 
the jungle and there was a roaring and an echoing rumble in his 



in 




 



ears. Powell reached out on the 
TP Band, sensing, touching, feeling. There was nothing but blind 
fear, blind rage, blind instinct 
around him. 

"It's worth the chance," Powell 
said to himself. "I've got to bust 
that barrier." 

He set his blocks on the upper 
levels, masking everything except 
fear, terror, fear . . . 

Every bird awoke screaming. 
The monkeys screamed back and 
shook branches in sudden flight. 
A barrage of sucking explosions 
sounded from the lake as hippos 
surged up from the shallows in 
blind terror. The jungle was' 
shaken by the ear-splitting trumpetings of elephants and the 
thunder of their stampede. Reich 
heard and froze, ignoring Hassop, 
who still ran and sobbed, crashing from wall to wall of the 
barrier. 

The hippos hit the barrier first. 
They were followed by the gigantic swambats and the crocodiles. Then came the elephants, 
the wapiti, the zebra, the gnu . . . 
heavy, pounding herds. The manufacturers of the Defensive Barrier Screen had never anticipated 
a stampede like this. Reich's barrier went down with a sound like 
scissored glass. 

The hippos trampled the fire. 
Powell darted through the darkness, seized Hassop's arm, and 
dragged the crazed man across 
the clearing to the piled packs. 



A wild hoof sent him reeling, but 
he held on to Hassop and located 
the precious film cannister. Still 
dragging Hassop, he peeped his 
way through the stampede. 

Behind the thick bole of a 
lignum vitae, Powell paused to 
catch his breath and settle the 
cannister safely in his pocket. 
Hassop was still sobbing. Powell 
sensed Reich, a hundred feet 
away, back against a fever tree, 
bow and arrows clutched in his 
stricken hands. He was confused, 
furious, terrified . . . but still 
safe. Powell wanted to keep him 
safe for Demolition. 

Unhitching his Defensive Screen 
Barrier from his belt, Powell 
tossed it across the clearing toward the embers of the fire where 
Reich would surely find it. Then 
he turned and led the numb, unresisting Code Chief toward the 
gate. 

XIV 

A ND so, at last, the Reich case 
was ready for the District 
Attorney's office and that dreaded 
monster of facts and evidence, 
Mr. Peetcy. 

Powell and his staff assembled 
in Peetcy *s office. A round 
table had been set up in the center, and on it was constructed 
a transparent model of the key 
rooms of Beaumont House, inhabited by miniature android 
figures of the people involved. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



111 



The Lab had done a superlative 

Job ; the models actually resembled the originals. Alongside 
the table was massed the documentation the staff had prepared, 
ready for presentation to the legal ogre. 

Mr. Peetcy himself occupied 
the entire circular wall of his 
giant office. His multitudinous 
eyes winked and glared coldly. 
His prodigious memory whirred 
and hummed. His mouth, the 
cone of a speaker, hung open in 
• kind of astonishment at human 
gtupidity. His hands, the keys 
cf a multiflex typewriter, poised 
over a roll of tape, ready to hammer sense into anybody. Mr. 
Peetcy was the Prosecution 
Transistor Computer of the Distort Attorney's Office, whose awful decisions controlled the 
preparation, presentation and 
prosecution of every police case. 

"We won't bother Peetcy to 
start with," Powell told the D A. 
"Let's take a look at the models 
and check them against the 
Crime Schedule. Your staff has 
the time sheets. If you catch anything our gang's missed, make a 
note." 

He nodded to Kr^t, the harrassed Lab Chief, who touched a 
button. Instantly the model was 
illumined and the dolls came to 
life. Acoustics had faked a background. There was a hint of 
music, laughter and chatter. In 
the main hall of Beaumont House, 



a pneumatic model of Maria 
Beaumont slowly climbed to a 
dais with a tiny book in her 
hands. 

"The time is 11:09 at that 
point," Powell said to the D.A.'s 
staff. "Watch the clock above the 
model. It's geared to synchronize 
with the action." 

In rapt silence, the legal division studied the scene and jotted 
notes while the androids reproduced the actions discovered by 
the Moltecs, reported by the witnesses, and inferred by Powell's 
squad. The lights went out in the 
model house. The miniature game 
of Sardine began. The tiny figure 
of Reich entered the Music Room, 
met Duffy Wyg& and the Chervil 
boy, climbed to the Orchid Suite, 
extinguished the guards and entered the room to encounter 
D'Courtney. The staging of the 
murder surprised the lawyers, 
who made inquiring sounds. 

"Got that material from the 
D'Courtney girl," Powell murmured. "Peeped her. It's authentic/' 

The little drama came to an 
end at last with the stampede of 
the guests from the Panty projection room up to the Orchid 
Suite Where the dolls burst in 
and crowded around the tiny 
dead body. There they froze in 
a grotesque little tableau. 

"And that's the overall picture," Powell said. "Now let's 
take it apart, point for point, and 



6Al«Xf SttlKCE -FICTION 



feed it to Mr. Peetcy. First, opportunity — " 

The office door banged open 
and Commissioner Crabbe 
marched in as though heading a 
parade. Behind him were two 
officers of the Commissioner's 
squad with a sallow, shriveled 
man between them. 

"Mr. Prefect," Crabbe pronounced formally. 

"Mr. Commissioner?" 

"While you and the members 
of your staff have wasted valuable time, the Police Commissioner's office has quietly, efficiently and without fanfare 
performed and executed the official functions which your — " 

"Excuse me, Commissioner," 
Powell interrupted wearily. "We'll 
have the speech another time. 
We're trying to finish off. the 
Reich Case." 

"The Reich Case is ended." 

"Delighted to hear it As of 
when?" 

"One hour ago, when it was 
re-titled the MacGranger Case. 
There," announced the Commissioner, pointing dramatically at 
the shriveled man, "stands Sherman MacGranger, self-confessed 
murderer of Craye D'Courtneyl" 

"Oh, hell, not another one!" 

"This man has confessed to the 
murder and has, with one blow 
of almighty truth, smashed the 
malicious accusation against a 
man as incapable of crime as I 
am!" 



"I killed him," MacGranger 
said. 

"He didn't kill D'Courtney, 
Mr. Commissioner. We know this 
kind. We peep 'em every day." 

"Mr. Prefect, I employed a 
bona fide member of your Guild 
to check MacGranger's confession. He assures me that MacGranger is not lying." 

"The hell you say. Who peeped 
him?" 

"Dr. Alfred Gammon, the eminent psychiatrist who — " 

"Gammon?" $$on repeated. 
"He's a 3rd, a lay psychologist. 
He couldn't peep a cockroach" 

"I killed him," MacGranger 
said. i 

"He's not lying, sir. He — " 

"He's lying to himself, Mr. 
Commissioner," Powell said. 
"He's perfectly sincere, but he 
can't make us believe he's the 
killer. Too many have tried that 
already." 

"What?" 

"Oh, sure. We've had our quota 
of cranks who came busting into 
headquarters hollering for Demolition. How many so far, $$on?" 

"Eighteen. And every one honestly believing he murdered 
D'Courtney." 

"Preposterous." 

"Then the history of Criminal 
Investigation is preposterous, sir. 
There's rarely been a celebrated 
crime when deluded characters 
haven't pestered the police with 
confessions. Some actually got 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



themselves sentenced. That was 
before TP, of course. Nowadays, 
we protect the innocent from 
themselves. I'm going to protect 
Sherman MacGranger from himself and from you." 

"If you imagine you can pull 
your peeper tricks on me, Powell—" 

"I'll do it with the objective 
evidence." Powell turned to the 
shriveled man. "Who invited you 
to the Beaumont party?" 

"I killed him," MacGranger 
«aid. 

"All right, you killed him. How 
Ad you get in?" 

"I crashed." 

"As a servant?" 

MacGranger smiled craftily. 
"No, as a guest." 

4 %a those clothes?" 

"The kind Maria Beaumont 
likes. Skintight leotards." 

"Did you know where D'Courtney was?" 

Without hesitation, MacGranger pointed to the Orchid Suite. 
"He was a lousy, stinkin' crook 
and I killed him right there!" 

"How did you get up there to 
kill him?" 

"In the Sardine game." 

"How did you play Sardine?" 

"We put out all the lights and 
one person was It and she went 
hiding. Everybody went looking 
for her and when they found her, 
they hid with her. Finally only 
one was left all alone in the dark 
wandering around wondering 



where everybody was and I went 
Bp and killed that dirty son — " 
"Are you peeping him?" Powell 
asked $$on. "Magnificent! The 
paranoid's paranoiac. He's gotten 
all that material from the Pantys, 
but he really believes he was 
there." 

"Never mind your aspersions, 
Mr. Prefect," Crabbe said angrily. 
"You have not shaken MacGranger's confession by one iota." 

"Haven't you noticed his mistake yet? I'll point it up for you. 
How did you murder D' Courtney, 
MacGranger?" 

"An infinite ray." 

"There's no such animal." 

"I invented it." 

"MacGranger's a mechanic,** 
Crabbe cut in hastily. "He's described his invention to me. We 
will have technicians pass on it 
*t a later — *' 

"I've peeped his picture of the 
weapon. Describe it for the staff, 
Mr. Commissioner." 

"Well, it's a power-pack projector. It has a double hand grip 
because the recoil is apparently 
tremendous. A projector of such 
power would be required to blow 
out D'Courtney's head, as actually happened." 

"Sure," Powell replied casually. "Now ask him where he 
concealed it." 

Crabbe stared. 

"Clever up, Commissioner. He 
was in skintight leotards. Where 
did he conceal a two-handed 



114 




 



power-pack 'infinite ray* projector? Not in leotards- A dirk, 
maybe, but not the machine 
you've described." 

"My God!" Crabbe exclaimed 
faintly. "I — I never — " 

"Well, MacGranger?" Powell 
asked kindly. "What's the answer?" 

* The shriveled maja burst into 
tears. Crabbe angrily hauled him 
out of the room and came back 
alone, not particularly mollified. 

Powell turned to his staff. 
"Let's get back to work. We'll 
feed everything to Peetcy for 
an opinion. First, opportunity. 
There's no argument with the 
Moltecs. Reich went up twice as 
indicated in the model — once to 
kill, a second time with the posse. 
You lawyers have any beefs on 
that?" 

"That Sardine game," the D.A. 
said. 

"Reich bought the book, sent it 
to Beaumont." 

"How'd he know she'd play 
Sardine?" 

"He knew she liked games. Sardine was the only completely 
legible one in the book." 

The D.A. scratched his head. 
"Peetcy takes a lot of convincing. 
Won't do any harm to try it on, 
though." 

Crabbe, whose aplomb made 
quick recoveries, burst out: "Gentlemen, I have never approved of 
the use of that mechanical monster." 



$$on began feeding the punched, 
data into Peetcy'.s ear. "You're 
absolutely right, Commissioner." 

"Now about method," said 
Powell. "First question: How'd 
Reich knock out the guards? 
Kr^t?" 

"And furthermore, gentlemen. 
..." Crabbe continued. 

"Rhodopsin Ionizer," Kr^t 
cut in. He handed a plastic sphere 
to Powell, who exhibited it. "Man 
named J^Jniaine developed it for 
Reich's private police. I've got 
the empiric processing formula 
ready for Peetcy, and the sample 
we mocked up. Anybody care to 
try it?" 

The D.A. looked dubious. "I 
don't see the use. Peetcy can 
decide about that." 

"In addition to which, gentlemen ..." 

"Oh, come on, Crabbe," Kr^t 
said with unpleasant cheerfulness. "You'll never believe us unless you see it for yourself. It' 
doesn't hurt. Just makes you 
non compose for six or seven — 

The plastic bulb shattered in 
Powell's fingers. A vivid blue 
light flared under Crabbe's nose. 
Caught in mid-oration, the Commissioner dropped to the floor. 

"Good Heavens!" Powell exclaimed. He looked at Kri^t severely. "You made the covering 
too thin, Kr^t. Now see what 
you've done to Commissioner 
Crabbe." 

"What I've done?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



I IT 



"Feed that data to Peetcy" 
the D.A. said in a voice rigid 
with control. "This he'll buy." 

They made the Commissioner 
comfortable. "Now the murder 
method " Powell repeated. 
"Kindly watch this, gentlemen. 
The hand is quicker than the 
eye." He exhibited a revolver 
from the police museum. From 
the chambers he removed the 
shells, and from one of the shells 
he extracted the bullet. "This is 
what Reich did to the gun Jerry 
Church gave him before the murder — pretended to make it safe. 
A phony alibi." 

"Phony, hell! That gun is safe. 
Is that Church's evidence?" 

"It is. Look at your sheet." 

"Then you don't have to bother 
Peetcy with the problem." The 
D.A. threw his papers down in 
disgust. "How can a cartridge kill 
without a bullet? Your sheet 
doesn't say Reich reloaded." 

"He reloaded." 

"He did not," Kri^t insisted. 
"There was no projectile in the 
wound or the room." 

"Why, you located it yourself, 
Krl^t. That bit of candy gel in 
D'Courtney's mouth. Remember? 
And no candy in the stomach." 

Krl/£t glared, Powell grinned. 
He took an eyedropper and filled 
a. gel capsule with water, pressed 
it into the open end of the cartridge above the charge and 
placed the cartridge in the gun. 
He raised the gun, aimed at a 

111 



small wooden block on the edge 
of the model table, and pulled the 
trigger. There was a dull, flat explosion and the block leaped into 
fragments. 

"That was a trick!" The D.A. 
exclaimed. "There was something 
in that shell besides water." 

"With a powder charge, you 
can shoot an ounce of water with 
enough muzzle velocity to blow 
out the back of a head if you fire 
through the victim's palate. 
That's why Reich had to shoot 
through the mouth. That's w,hy 
Kri/^t found that bit of gel and 
nothing else. The projectile, of 
course, was gone." 

"Give it to Peetcy," the D.A. 
said faintly. "By God, Powell, 
I'm beginning to think we've got 
a case." 

"All right. Now, motive. We 
picked up Reich's business records; Accounting's gone through 
them. D'Courtney had Reich with 
his back to the wall. Reich tried 
to join D'Courtney. He failed. He 
murdered D'Courtney. Will you 
buy that?" 

"Sure I'll buy it, but will 
Peetcy? Feed it in and let's see." 

They fed in the last of the 
punched data, shifted Peetcy up 
from "Idle" to "Run." Peetcy's 
eyes blinked in hard meditation; 
his stomach rumbled softly; his 
memory stuttered. Powell and the 
others waited with mounting suspense. A soft bell began to ping 
and Peetcy's type hammered.'

"What the hell?" Powell looked 
at $$on. 

"He gets kittenish now and

They held the warm-up for a 
good five minutes and then kicked 
him into it. Once more his eyes 
blinked, his stomach growled, his

A month's hard work hung on

"Excuse me," Powell said to the 
others, "I've got to peep this out 
with $$on." He turned to $$on: 
"Open up, Charley. I smelled an 
evasion in them last words." 

"Honestly, Pres, I'm not aware 
of any — " 

"// you were aware, it wouldn't 
be an evasion. It'd be a downright 
lie. Now lemme see . . . Oh. Of 
course?" Powell spoke aloud to 
the staff: "$$on's missing one 
small point. Code is still working 
with Hassop upstairs. We've got 
the knowledge that Reich offered 
merger and was refused. But we 
haven't decoded the definite offer 
and refusal yet. That's what 
Peetcy wants." 

"How do you know the offer 
was made and refused?" the D. A. 
«sked, 

"Got that from Reich himself 
through Gus T8. It was one of the 
last things T8 gave me before he 
was murdered. I tell you what, 
$$on — add an assumption to the 
tape. Assuming that our merger 
evidence is unassailable, which it 
is, what does Peetcy think of the 
case?" 

$$on hand punched s strip, 
spliced it to the main problem 
and fed it in again. By now well 
warmed up, Peetcy answered in 
thirty seconds: "brief #921,088. 

ACCEPTING ASSUMPTION, PROBABILITY OF SUCCESSFUL PROSECUTION

Powell's staff grinned and relaxed. Powell tore the tape out 



and presented it to the D.A. with 
a flourish. 

"By God I" the D.A. said. 
"Ninety-seven per cent! I thought 
I was lucky when I broke seventy If 

The office door opened and 
two perspiring men came in. 

"Here's Code now," Powell 
said. "You bust it?" 

"We busted it," one said, "and 
now you're busted, Powell. The 
whole case is busted." 

"What are you talking about?" 

"Reich knocked off D'Courtney 
because D'Courtney ' wouldn't 
merge? He had a nice fat profit 
motive for killing D'Courtney? 
In a pig's eye he did." 

"Reich sent yyji tted rrcb 
uufe aalk qqba to D'Courtney," 
the other added. "That reads: 

SUGGEST MERGER BOTH OUR INTERESTS EQUAL PARTNERSHIP." 

"Damn it, that's what I've said 
all along. And D'Courtney replied: WWHG. That was a refusal. Reich told T8. T8 told me." 

"D'Courtney answered wwhg. 
That reads: accept offer." 

"The hell it does!" 

"The hell it doesn't. You'll 
never convince any court in the 
Solar System that Reich had a 
motive for murdering D'Courtney. Your case is washed out." 

Powell stood still, his fists 
clenched. Suddenly he pulled out 
the android figure of Reich and 
twisted its head off. He went to 
Peetcy, yanked out the tapes of

punched data, crumpled tfcem 
into a wad and hurled the wad 
across the room. He launched a 
tremendous kick at the chair 
Crabbe sat slumped in. While 
the staffs watched in appalled silence, the chair and Commissioner 
overturned to the floor. 

"Damn you, you're always sitting in that chair!" Powell -said 
and stormed out of the office.

Who's outside the cell-block? 
The Man With No Face! Looking. Looming. Silent. 

Fly through space! There's

of this velvet-lined launch. The

The pounding turned to 
knocking on the stateroom door. 
"Over New York, Mr. Reich. One 
hour to debarkation.*' 



"All right," Reich croaked. "I 
hear you." 

Climbing out of bed, still in 
the grip of the nightmare's terror, 
he lurched around the stateroom. 
He hurled his linen and clothes 
into the Disposary, selected fresh 
clothes from the Dispenser and 
laid them out. 

He went into the bathroom, 
depilated, showered, steamed and 
air-washed for ten minutes. He 
was still reeling. He stepped into 
the massage alcove and punched 
"Glow Salt." There was a dull 
concussion and Reich was hurled 
to the floor, his back slashed by 
flying particles, 

Reacting instinctively, he 
darted into the bedroom, seized 
his traveling case, groped for the 
cartridge of detonation bulbs he 
always carried. There were none 
in the case. 

Reich pulled himself together. 
Aware of the bite of salt in the 
cuts in his back, he went back 
into the bathroom, shut off the 
massage buffers and inspected the 
alcove wreckage. Someone had 
removed the cartridge from his 
case during the night and planted 
a bulb in each of the massage 
buffers. The empty cartridge lay 
behind the alcove. 

He inspected his stateroom 
door. The lock had evidently 
been gaffed by a master. But 
who? Why? 

He returned deliberately to the 
bathroom, washed off the salt

and blood, and sprayed his back 
with coagulent. He dressed, had 
his coffee and descended to the 
Staging Hall where, after a savage skirmish with the peeper Customs Man (Tension, apprehension and dissension have began]), 
he boarded the Sacrament launch 
that was waiting to take him 
downjto the city. 

From the launch he called Sacrament. His secretary's face appeared on the screen. 

"Any news of Hassop?" Reich 
asked. 

"No f Mr. Reich. Not since you 
called from Ampro." 

"Give me Relations." 

The screen disclosed the chrome 
lounge of Sacrament. West, carefully binding sheets of typescript 
into plastic volumes, looked up 
and grinned. 

"Hi, Ben." 

"Don't look so cheerful, Ellery," Reich growled. "Where the 
hell is Hassop? I thought you'd 
surely — " 

West displayed the volumes. 
"History of my career with Sacrament for your files. Said career 
ended this morning at nine." 

"What?" 

"The Guild's just ruled Sacrament out of bounds. Company 
espionage is unethical." 

"Ellery, you can't quit now. 
Someone tried to boobytrap me 
on the ship this morning. I've 
got to find out who it is. I need 
a peeper." 



"Sorry, Ben." 

"You don't have to work for 
Sacrament. 1*11 put you under 
personal contract for private service. The same contract Breen 
has." 

"Breen? The analyst? Not any 
more." 

"No — more?" 

"The ruling came down today. 
Exclusive practice barred. It 
limits the service of peepers. 
We've got to be dedicated to the 
most good for the most people." 

"It's that bastard, Powell !" 
Reich shouted. "Using every 
lousy peeper trick he can dig out 
of the slime to bitch me!" 

"Sign off, Ben. Powell had nothing to do with it. It was T'sungHsai, our president. Old T-H 
finally got around to commercial 
jurisdiction and handed down a 
raft of rulings this morning. You 
got bracketed between a couple of 
them, that's all." 

"You smug peepers talk so 
much about ethics, but you fight 
as dirty as — " 

"Ben ! Whafs the use of 
screaming? We've always made 
it pleasant. Let's break it pleasant." 

"Go to hell !" Reich roared and 
cut the connection. To the launch 
pilot he said in the same tone: 
"Take me home!" 

REICH burst into his tower 
apartment, once again awakening the hearts of his staff to

terror and hatred. He hurled his 
traveling case at the horse-faced 
valet and went immediately to 
Breen's suite. 
It was empty. 

Reich strode to his own rooms 
and went to the phone. He dialed 
Gus T8. The screen cleared: 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTINUED 
Reich stared, broke the connection and dialed Jeremy Church. 
The screen cleared : 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTINUED 

He swore and tried Keno 
Q uizzard's gambling house. 
Again: 

SERVICE PERMANENTLY 
DISCONTUVUED 

Reich paced around the study 
uncertainly, then went to the 
shimmer of light in the corner 
that was his safe, wondering if 
old Geoffrey Reich had anything 
to contribute. He switched the 
safe into temporal phase, revealing the honeycomb paper rack, 
and reached for the small red envelope. As he touched it, he heard 
the faint click. He doubled up 
and spun away, his face buried 
in his arms. 

Something brutal punched 
Reich in the side and slammed 
him against the wall. He heard 
his staff come running down the 
corridor and roared: "Keep out! 
All of you!" 

He stumbled through' the 
wreckage and began sorting over 



the remains of his safe. He found 
the TP scrambler he had taken 
from Chooka Flood's red-eyed 
woman. He found the malignant 
steel flower that was the knifepistol that had killed D' Courtney. It still contained four unfired shells loaded with water 
and sealed with gel. He thrust 
both into his pocket, got a fresh 
cartridge of detonation bulbs from 
his desk, and tore out of the 
room, ignoring the servants who 
stared at him in astonishment. 

Reich swore feverishly from the 
tower apartment to the cellar garage where he deposited his 
Jumper key in the call slot and 
waited for the little car. When 
it came out of storage with the 
key in the door, Reich turned t^e 
key and yanked open the door to 
jump in. There was a low pressure rip. R?ich hurled himself to 
the ground. The Jumper tank 
exploded, erupting a shattering 
geyser of fuel and fragments of 
metal. Reich crawled frantically, 
reached the exit ramp and ran. 

On the street level, bleeding, 
rank with creosote fuel, he flagged 
a Jumper. 

"Where to?" the driver as'r-d. 

He tried to think co'ierendy. 
"Chooka Frood's. Down in Bastion West." 

"They'll never let you in looking like that." 

"Chooka Frood!" Reich repeated. 

The cab hopped him there. He 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 123 



thrust past the protesting doorman and the indignant reception 
clerk to the private office. Chooka 
was seated at the desk, wearing 
a dingy smock and a dingy expression that changed to alarm 
when Reich yanked the scrambler 
out of his pocket. 

"Here I am, Chooka," he said 
hoarsely. "I used this scrambler 
on you once before. I'm warmed 
up for it again." 

She screamed: "Magda!" 

Reich caught her by the arm 
end hurled her across the office. 
The red-eyed woman came running into the office. Reich was 
ready for her. He clubbed her 
s cross the b ack of the neck . 

Ignoring her, he spat at 
Chooka; "Let's get it squared off. 
Why the boobytraps?" 

Chfcoka shook her head daz«dly. 

"Three of them so far. On the 
»hip coming back from Ampro. 
In my study. In my Jumper, How 
many more, Chooka?" 

"It wasn't me, Reich. So help 
me!" 

"My stateroom lock was gaffed. 
My safe lock was gaffed. My 
Jumper lock was gaffed. That 
taVes a professional heavy gimptter. It adds up to you, so let's 
get it squared off." He slammed 
the safety off the scrambler. "I've 
got a man named Powell to 
swindle. I've got a cartel named 
D'Courtney to swindle. I've got 
no time to waste on you." 



"For God's sake!" Chooka 
screamed. "What have 1 got 
against you? So you roughhoused a little. So you mugged 
Magda. So you strong-armed the 
D'Courtney girl out of me. Would 
I be shoving you into the Serpent 
because you held a scrambler on 
me? Use your head!" 

"I used it. If it isn't you, who , 
else?" 

"Keno Quizzard. He hires 
gimpsters too. I heard you and 
him — " 

"Quizzard's dead. Who else?" 
"Church." 

"He hasn't got the guts or he 
would have tried it ten years ago. 
Now he's waiting for favors. Who 
else?" 

"How do I know? There's hundreds hate you enough." 

"Thousands, but who could get 
into my safe? Who could break 
a phase combination and — " 

"Maybe nobody broke into 
your safe. Maybe somebody broke 
into your head and peeped the 
combination." 

"Peeped!" 

"Yeah, peeped. Maybe you 
added Church up wrong, or some 
other peeper that's got a reason 
to fill your coffin." 

"Yes," Reich whispered. 

"Church?" 

"Powell! He can't get a case 
together. I stopped him with 
Duffy Wyg&'s song. I stopped 
him with the Sardine game. He 
can't get at % ma m e and the 



124 



GALAXY SCIENCf FICTION 



Rhodopsin. He can't get the gun. 
He got the D'Courtney girl, but 
•he's probably in Kingston Hospital right now. Hassop's dead in 
that stampede or missing. He's 
got nothing but boobytrapping 
left,. . ." 

"You're crazy, Reich." 

"Am I? Why did he take EIlcry West and Breen away from 
me? He knows the only defense 
I've got against a boobytxap is 
a peeper." 

"But a cop, Reich?" 

"Why not a cop? Who'd suspect him? It's what I'd do myself. 
All right, now I'm going to boobytrap him!" He went to Chooka 
and yanked her to her feet. "Call 
Powell. Tell him to come down 
here right away." 

"No, Reich 

"Listen to me, frab-head. Bastion West is owned by the 
D'Courtney cartel. Now that old 
D'Courtney's dead, I own the 
cartel. I own you, Chooka. You 
want to stay in business? Call 
Powell!" 

"He's a peeper. When he comes 
down, he'll know I'm lying." 

"Wait a minute." Reich 
thought, then yanked the knifepistol from his pocket and shoved 
it into Chooka's hands. "Tell him 
the D'Courtney girl left this here. 
It's the gun D'Courtney rode onto 
the Serpent." 

"And you're giving it to him?" 

Reich laughed. "By the time 
he's got it, he'll be booby trapped/* 



He thrust Chooka toward the 
phone, followed her and stood 
alongside the screen out of the 
line of sight. He hefted the scrambler in his hand meaningfully. 

She dialed Powell's number. 
Mary Noyes appeared on the 
screen, listened to Chooka, then 
called Powell. The Prefect appeared, his lean face haggard, 
his dark eyes heavily shadowed. 

"I . . . I got something you 
might want, Mr. Powell," Chooka 
stammered. "I just found it. That 
girl you took outa my house left 
it behind. The gun that sent her 
father onto the Serpent. See?" 

"That's it, by heaven!" Powell 
exclaimed. "I'll be down as fast 
as a Jumper can jet." 

The screen blacked out. Reich 
dashed out of the Rainbow House 
and ran through the alleys of Bastion West until he located a public 
Jumper. He dropped a coin into 
the lock, opened the door and 
lurched in. 

"Don't try to think" he 
thought. "Don' t try to plan. 
Leave it to your instincts. Just 
wait and kill!" 

Reich fought himself and the 
controls all the three miles to 
Hudson Ramp. The killer instinct prompted him to crashland in Powell's back garden. He 
didn't know why. As he pounded 
the twisted cabin door open, a 
canned voice spoke: "Your attention, please. You are liable for 
the damage to this vehicle. Leave 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



your name and address. If we 
are forced to trace you, you will 
be liable for the costs. Thank 
you." 

"I'm going to be liable for a 
lot more," Reich growled. "You're 
welcome." 

He plunged under a heavy 
clump of forsythia and waited 
with the scrambler ready. Then 
he understood why he had 
crashed. The girl who had answered Powell's phone ran 
through the garden toward the 
jumper. Reich waited. No one 
else came from the house. The 
girl spun around before she heard 
him. A peeper. He pulled the trigger to first notch. She stiffened, 
helpless. 

He was about to pull the trigger a^ the way back to the big 
D, but instinct stopped him again. 
Kill the girl in the house. Seed 
he:T body with detonation bulbs 
and leave that bait for Powell. 
Reich forced a handkerchief into 
her mouth, took her by the arm. 

Inside the house, Reich found 
a long, corded modern lounge in 
the living room and thrust the 
girl down on it. She was fighting 
him with everything but her paralyzed body. He grinned savagely, 
bent down and kissed her full on 
the mouth. 

"My love to Powell," he said, 
raising the scrambler. 

Someone was watching him. 

He darted a quick look around 
the living room. There was no 



one. He turned back to the girl. 
"You doing that with TP, peeper?" Then he raised the scrambler. 
Again he lowered it. 

Someone was watching him. 

This time, Reich prowled 
around the living room, searching 
behind chairs, inside • closets, 
checked the kitchen and the bath. 
No one. He returned to the living room and Mary Noyes, then 
thought of the upper floor. He 
went to the stairs, started to 
mount them, and stopped in midstride. 

Someone was watching him. 

She was at the head of the 
stairs, kneeling and peeping 
through the banisters. She was 
dressed like a child "in tight little 
leotards with her hair drawn back 
and tied with ribbon. Barbara 
D' Courtney. 

"I'm Baba," she said. 

Reich, shaking, motioned to 
her faintly. She came down the 
stairs, holding on to the banister 
carefully. 

"I'm not s'posed to," she said. 
"Are you Papa's friend?" 

Reich took a breath. "I . . . " 

"Papa had to go away," she 
prattled. "But he's coming back 
right away. If I'm a good girl, 
he'll bring me a present. I'm trying, but it's awful hard. Are you 
good?" 

"Coming b-back? Your father?" 

She noddedL "You kissed Aunt 
Mary. I saw it- Papa kisses me. 
I like it. Does Aunt Mary like 



1*6 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



it?" She took his hand confidently. "When I grow up. I'm 
going to marry Papa. Do you 
have a girl?" 

Reich pulled Barbara around 
and stared into her face. "Do you 
think I'll fall into that orbit? 
How much did you tell Powell?" 

"That's my papa," she said. 
"When I ask him why his name 
is different from my name, he 
looks funny. What's your name?" 

"Who do you think you're fooling with that act? Answer me!— 
How much did you tell him?" 

She began to cry, trying to pull 
away from him. "Let me go!" 

He dragged her to the lounge 
where Mary Noyes still sat paralysed. He threw the girl down 
beside her and stepped back 
again, with the scrambler raised. 
Suddenly, the girl whipped upright in the chair in a listening 
attitude. Her face lost its childishness and became drawn and 
taut. She leaped from the lounge, 
ran, stopped abruptly, then appeared to open a door. She ran 
forward, yellow hair flying, dark 
eyes wide with alarm ... a lightning flash of wild beauty. 

"Father!" she screamed. "For 
God's sake! Father!" 

Reich's heart constricted. The 
girl ran toward him. He stepped 
forward to catch her. She darted 
to the left. 

"No!" she cried. "No! Father!" 

Reich caught her while she 
fought and screamed. The girl 



suddenly stiffened and clutched 
her ears. Reich was in the Orchid 
Suite. He heard the explosion 
and saw the blood and brains 
gout out of the back of D'Courtney's head. She fell to her knees 
and crawled across the floor. He 
saw her crouch over the waxen 
body. 

Reich gasped for breath and 
beat his knuckles together painfully, fighting for control. He had 
never counted on a witness. Damn 
Gus T8 ! Wait. He wasn't in 
Beaumont House. He was in ... , 

"Thirty -three Hudson Ramp," 
Powell informed him from the 
front door. 

Reich jerked around, whipped 
the scrambler up. 

"Don't try it," Powell warned 
sharply. 

"You son of a bitch!" Reich 
shouted. "You God damned 
peeper !" 

Powell faked to the left, reversed, delivered a six inch jab 
to the Ulnar synapse. The scrambler fell to the floor. Reich 
clinched, punching, clawing, butting. Powell hit him with three 
lightning blows — nape, navel and 
groin. The effect was that of a 
full spinal block. Reich crashed 
to the floor, retching, blood 
streaming from his nose. 

"You only think you know how 
to gut-fight," Powell grunted. He 
went to Barbara D'Courtney, who 
still knelt on the floor, and raised 
her. "All right, Barbara?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



\17 I 



"Hello, Papa. I had a bad 

dream." 

"I had to give it to you. It 
was an experiment on that big 
oaf." 

"Gimme a kiss." 

He kissed her forehead. "You're 
growing up fast," he smiled. "You 
were just baby-talking yesterday." 

"I'm growing up because you 
promised to wait for me." 

"It's a promise, Barbara. Can 
you go upstairs to your room by 
yourself or do you have to be 
carried . . . like yesterday?" 

"I can go all by my own self." 

She took a firm hold on the 
banister and climbed up. Just 
before she reached the top, she 
stuck her tongue out at Reich, 
thenVdisappeared. Powell crossed 
to Mary Noyes, removed the gag, 
checked her pulse. 

"First notch, eh?" he said to 
Retch. "Painful, but she'll recover in an hour. I ought to pay 
you back for this, but what's the 
use? It wouldn't teach you anything. You're just no damned 
good." 

"Kill me!" Reich groaned, 
writhing. "Kill me or let me up 
and, by Christ, I'll kill you!" 
( Powell picked up the scrambler. "Try flexing your muscles 
a little. Those blocks shouldn't 
last more than a few seconds ..." 
He sat down with the scrambler 
in his lap. "You had a tough 
break. I wasn't out of the house 



five minutes when I realized 
Chooka's story was a phony. You 
put her up to it, of course." 

"You're the aphony!" Reich 
shouted. "You and your ethicsl" 

"She said the gun sent 
D' Courtney on the Serpent," 
Powell continued imperturbably. 
"It did, but she couldn't know 
what killed D'Courtney. I turned 
around and came back, of course." 

Reich struggled up, his breath 
hissing horribly. Suddenly he 
dipped into his pocket and 
brought out the cartridge of detonation bulbs. Powell arched 
back in the chair and kicked 
Reich in the chest. The cartridges 
went flying. Reich collapsed on 
a sofa. 

"When will you learn you can't 
surprise a peeper?" Powell said. 
He went to the cartridge and 
picked it up. "Quite the arsenal 
today, aren't you? You're acting 
more like a wanted 1 man than like 
a free man. Notice I said free, 
not innocent." 

"Free how long?" Reich said 
through his teeth.»"I never talked 
about innocence either. But free 
how long?" 

*'l had a perfect case against 
you. Every detail right. I checked 
that when I peeped you with 
Barbara just now. That one flaw 
blew my case out into deep space. 
You're a free man, Reich. We've 
closed your file." 

Reich stared. "Closed the file?" 
"You can disarm, Reich. No 



128 




 



one's going to bother you. n 

"This is one of your peeper 
tricks!" 

"I'll lay it out for you. I know 
all about you . , . how much you 
bribed Gus T8 . . . what you 
promised Jerry Church . . . where 
you located that Sardine Game 
. . . what you did with Wilson 
54maine's Rhodopsin Caps . . . 
how you emptied those cartridges 
for an alibi and then turned them 
lethal again with water. So far 
a perfect chain of evidence. 
Method and opportunity. But 
motive was the flaw. The courts 
demand objective motive and I 
can't produce it. That sets you 
free." 

"You liar!" 

"I could throw breaking and 
entering with deadly intent at 
you, but it's too small a charge. 
You could probably beat it, too. 
My only witnesses would be a 
peeper and a sick girl." 

"Am I supposed to believe you? 
You had nothing, Powell. I 
licked you on every point. That's 
why you're boobytrapping me." 
Reich broke off abruptly. "This 
is probably the biggest boobytrap 
of all. And I fell into it. What a 
damned fool I am!" 

"Shut up," Powell snapped. 
"When you rave like that, I 
can't peep you!" 

Powell focused on Reich. Then 
his face began to pale. 

"That's it! Mr. Peetcy was 
right. Passion motive, and we 



thought he was kittenish. Barbara's Siamese twin image . . , 
D'Courtney's guilt. No wonder 
Reich couldn't kill us at Chooka's 
. . . But the murder isn't important any more. It goes deeper. 
And it's more dangerous than I 
ever dreamed." 

He stopped, turned and looked 
at Reich with blazing eyes. "Do 
you know how dangerous you 
are? Does a plague know its peril? 
Is death aware that it is death?" 

Reich goggled at Powell in bewilderment. 

"Why ask you?" Powell muttered. "You don't know what 
I'm talking about. You'll never 
know." 

He went to a sideboard, selected two brandy ampules and 
popped them into Reich's mouth. 
Reich choked on the brandy and 
sputtered angrily. 

"Get this straight," Powell 
said. "The case against you is 
closed because of those boobytraps. If I'd known about them, 
I'd have broken my conditioning 
and killed you." 

Reich stopped sputtering. 

"When you offered merger to 
D'Courtney, he sent wwhg in 
answer, which is acceptance. You 
had no reason to murder him. 
That was the flaw in the case." 

Reich went white, "wwhg — 
offer refused!" 

"He accepted. When I learned 
that I knew I couldn't bring the 
case to court. But I'm not the

man who's trying to murder you. 
That man is trying to kill you 
because he knows you're safe 
from Demolition. He's always 
known /what I've just discovered 
— that you're a ghastly menace to 
our entire future." 

Reich struggled up out of the 
sofa. ''Who is it? Who?" 

"Your ancient enemy, Reich. 
You'll never be able to run from 
him . . . hide from him . . . and 
I hope you'll never be able to 
save yourself from him." 

"WHO IS IT?" 

"The Man With No Face." 

Reich turned and staggered out 
of the house. 

XVI 

"YOU'VE got to think. What's 
■J- ^happened to you? Why 
don't you think?" 

Tension, apprehension and — 
"He was lying. A giant boobytrap, wwhg — refusal. But why 
did he lie? How is that going to 
help him?" 

— dissension have begun. 
"The Man With No Face. 
Breen could have told Powell. So 
could Gus T8. Think!" 
Tension— 

"There is no Man With No 
Face. It's just a nightmare!" 
Apprehension — 

"What about the boobytraps, 
though? He had me cold in his 
house. Why didn't he pull the 
switch? Telling me I'm free. 



What's he up to? Think!" 

Dissension — 
"He's your enemy. You'll never 
be able to run from him . . . hide 
from him . . . save yourself from 
him! Not the Man With No Face. 
It's Powell!" 

A hand touched his shoulder. 
"Mr. Reich?" 

Reich became aware that it 
was raining heavily. He was lying 
on his side, knees drawn up, 
drenched, shivering with cold. 
He was in the esplanade of 
Bomb Inlet. Around him were 
sighing, sodden trees. A figure 
was bending over him. 

"Who are you?" 

"Galen Chervil. From Maria 
Beaumont's party. Can I do you 
that favor, Mr. Reich?" 

"Don't peep me!" Reich cried. 

"I'm not, Mr. Reich. We don't 
usually — Young Chervil caught 
himself. "I didn't know you knew 
I was a peeper." 

"I know all you lousy — " 

"Don't say it, Mr. Reich. You'll 
make it too easy for me to agree 
with you." 

Young Chervil took him under 
the shoulders and raised him, 
staring at Reich's frightful appearance. 

"Were you mugged, Mr. 
Reich?" 

"What? No." 

"Accident, sir?" 

"No, I . . . Oh, get the hell 
away from me!" 

"Certainly, sir. I thought you 



1M 




 



needed help and I owe you a 
favor, but — " 

"Come back." Reich grasped 
the bole of a tree, thrust himself 
erect and glared at Chervil with 
bloodshot eyes. "You mean that 
about the favor?" 

"Of course, Mr. Reich." 

"My problem's murder, Chervil. I want to find out who's frying to kill me. Will you do me 
that favor? Will you peep someone for me?" 

"I should imagine the police 
would be able to — " 

"The police?" Reich laughed, 
then clutched himself in agony. 
"I want you to peep a top cop for 
me, Chervil. The Commissioner 
himself." He let go the tree and 
lurched to Chervil. "I want to 
visit my friend the Commissioner 
and ask him a few questions. I 
want you to be there to tell me 
the truth." 

"But the Commissioner might 
not care to be peeped, sir."" 

"He won't know he's peeped," 
Reich roared. "Look at me, you 
fool. I'm cut . . . I'm broken . . . 
I'm half out of my mind . . . I'm 
two-thirds murdered! I need that 
favor. You say you owe it. Will 
you come to Crabbe's office and 
peep him for me?" 

"Yes, Mr. Reich." 

"An honest peeper! How about 
that? Let's jet." 

"'Reich rah out of the esplanade 
like a freshly decapitated man.

the fury that drove Reich through 
injury, through fever, through 
agony to police headquarters. 
Ttfere, Reich bulled and roared 
past clerks and guards into Commissioner Cr abbe's elaborate 
ebony -and -silver office. 

"My God, Reich!" Crabbe was 
aghast. "It is you. isn't it?" 

"Sit down, Chervil," Reich said. 
He turned to Crabbe. "It's me. 
I was almost murdered three 
times today. This boy . . . M Reich 
pointed to Chervil. "This boy 
just found me in the Inlet Esplanade more dead than alive. 
And where have the damned police been?" 

*'Murdered!" Crabbe thumped 
his desk emphatically. "Of 
course! Powell is a fool. I should 
never have let Sherman MacGranger go." 

"Sherman MacWho?" 

"MacGranger. The man who 
murdered D'Courtney. He signed 
a confession . . . and that idiot 
Powell made me free him!" 

"MacGranger murdered 
D'Courtney?" 

"He did, Ben, and he's probably after you. I told Powell you 
were innocent. He wouldn't listen 
to me. I showed him MacGranger. 
He wouldn't listen to him. Even 
when Mr. Peetcy told him you 
were innocent, he wouldn't listen." 

"The machine said I was innocent?" 

"Of course 1 it did. There's no 

iff 



case against you. But there's ■ a 

case against MacGranger, and 
I'm going to convict him before 
he murders you, too." Crabbe 
strode to the door. "I'm sending 
out a call for him right now. 
Don't go, Ben, I want to talk to 
you about that Solar Senatorship . . . " 

. The door opened and slammed. 
Reich reeled and fought his way 
back to the world. He looked at 
three Chervils. "Well?" 

"He's telling the truth, Mr. 
Reich." 

"About me? About Powell? 
About MacGranger?" 

"He's telling the truth about 
you," Chervil said. "The Prosecution Transistor Computor has 
declined to authorize any action 
agajjjst you for the D'Courtney 
murder. Mr. Powell has been 
forced to abandon the case and 
. . ... well, his career is in jeopardy.** 

"Is that true?" Reich seized his 
shoulders. "Is it?** 

"Yes, Mr. Reich. The Commissioner believes he's telling the 
truth about Sherman MacGrangger, but his recollection shows 
that MacGranger could not be 
the murd — M 

"To hell with MacGranger! 
I've been cleared?** 

"You have been, Mr. Reich, No 
one's going to bother you."* 

Reich burst into a roar of triumphant laughter, brushed past 
Chervil and left the Commissioner's office, a Neanderthal ves


tige parading down headquarters* 
corridors,, streaked with blood 
and mud, laughing and groaning 
because of the pain of laughing, 
bearing himself with limping arrogance. 

He stood for a moment on the 
steps, gazing at the rainswept 
streets ... at the amusement 
center across the square, block 
after block blazing under a single 
transparent dome ... at the 
open shops lining the upper footways, all bustle and brilliance as 
the city's night shopping began 
. . . the towering office buildings 
in the background, great twohundred-story cubes and the lace 
tracery of skyways linking them 
together . . . the twinkling running lights of Jumpers. 

"I'll own you!" he promised, 
his laugh rising hysterically. 
"Live, die, laugh, cry, love, beget 
— I'll .own you all!" 

Then his eyes caught the tall, 
ominous familiar figure crossing 
the square, watching him covertly 
over its shoulder. A figure of black 
shadows sparkling with raindrop 
jewels . . . looking, looming, silent, horrible ... 

A Man With No Face. 

Like a blighted tree, Reich fell 
in a crooked arc to the ground. 

AT one minute to nine, ten of 
the fifteen members of the 
Esper Guild Council assembled 
in President T'sung Hsai's office. 
The minutes read as follows: 



132 



GALAXY SCIENCE FiCTIQN 



EMERGENCY BUSINESS 

Request for Mass Cathexis with 
Preston Powell as canal for Capitalized Energy. 
Consternation 

T'sung: Honorable Powell, your 
request bewilders this threadbare brain. What can possibly 
require such an extraordinary 
end dangerous measure? 

Powell: Reich is about to become 
a Galactic Focal Point ... A 
crucial link between the Positive Past and the Probable Future. He is on the verge of a 
powerful reorganization at this 
moment. If Reich can adjust 
before I reach him, he will become immune to our reality, 
invulnerable to our attack — 
the deadly enemy of our Guild 
and Galactic Reason and Reality. 

Alarm 

@kins: Surely you're exaggerating, Powell? 

Powell: Inspect the picture with 
me. Look at this perspective of 
Reich's position in time and 
space. Will not his beliefs become the world's belief? Will 
not his reality become the 
world's reality? Is he not, in 
his critical position of power, 
energy and intellect, a sure 
road to utter destruction? 

Conviction 

T'sung: It is the truth. Nevertheless, this unworthy person 
is most reluctant to authorize 
Mass Cathexis. It has invari


ably destroyed the Energy Canal in past attempts. You are 
too valuable to be destroyed, 
Powell. 

Powell: I must be permitted to 
run the risk. Reich is one of 
the rare Universe Shakers . . ; 
a child as yet, but about to 
mature. And all reality . . . 
Espers, Normals, Life, the 
Earth, the moons, the Solar 
System, the galaxies, the Universe itself ... all reality hangs

T>OWELL arrived home a half 
hour later. He bad made his 
will, paid his bills, arranged everything. There had been dismay 



THE D EMOUSH ED MAN 



at the Guild. There was dismay 
when he came home, for Mary 
Noyes got the picture the instant 
he entered. 

"No fuss. It's got to be done." 

"But—" 

"There s a chance it won't kill 
me. Oh, one thing. Lab wants a 
brain autopsy it I die. They'd 
tike to have the body before rigor. 
If they can't get the corpse, they'll 



settle for the head. See to it, 
will you?" 
"Pres.'" 

"Sorry. Now you'd better pack 
and take the baby up to Kingston 
Hospital. She won't be safe here." 

"She isn't a baby any more. 
She — Oh, Pres.'" 

Mary turned and ran upstairs, 
trailing the familiar sensory impact: Snow /mint /tulips/ taffeta, 
now mixed with terror and 
tears. Powell sighed, then smiled 
as a highly poised teen-ager appeared at the head of the stairs. 
She paused halfway down to let 




him take in the dress and the 
manner. 

"Why, ifs Mr. Powell, is it 
not?" 

"It is. Good morning,*Barbara." 

"And what brings you to our 
little domain this morning?" She 
came down the rest of the stairs 
with her fingertips brushing the 
banister, and tripped on the bottom step. "Oh, Pip!" she cursed. 

Powell caught her. "Pop," he 
•aid. 

"Bim." 

"Bam." 

She looked up at him. "You 
stand right here. I'm going to 
come down those stairs again and 
I bet I do it perfect." 

"1*11 bet you' don't." 

She turned, trotted up, posed 
again at the top step and began the grand descent. "I am no 
longer the mere child I was yesterday. I am ages and ages older. 
You must regard me as an adult 
from now on." She negotiated 
the bottom step and regarded him 
intently. "Good?" 

"Splendid, dear." 

Suddenly she laughed, pushed 
him into a chair and plumped 
down on his lap. Powell groaned. 

"Gently, Barbara. You're ages 
older and pounds heavier." 

"Listen," she said, "what ever 
made me think you were my 
father?" 

"What's the matter with me as 
a father?" 

"Do you feel like a father to


ward me? I don't feel like a 

daughter toward you." 
"Oh? How do you feel?" 
"I asked first, so you go first.'* 
"My feelings toward you are 

those of a loving and dutiful 

son." 

She flushed angrily and got up \ 
from his lap. "I wanted you to • 
be serious, because I need advice." 

"I'm sorry, Barbara. What is 
it?" 

She knelt alongside him and 
took his hand. "I'm all mixed up 
about you." 

"Yes. I know." 

"And you're all mixed up about 
me, too." 

"That's true. I am." 
"Is it wrong?" 

Powell heaved up from the 
chair and began pacing unhappily. "No, Barbara, it isn't wrong. 
The two of us are four peopletwo of you, and two of me." 

"Why?" 

"You've been sick, dear, so *.ve 
had to turn you into a baby and 
let you grow up again. That's 
why you're two people. The 
grown-up Barbara inside, the 
baby outside." 

"And you?" 

"I'm two grown-up people. One 
of them is me. The other is a 
member of the governing Council 
of the Esper Guild." 

She considered earnestly. "When 
I don't feel like a daughter to 
you, which me feels like that?"

**I don't know, Barbara." 

"You do know. Why won't you 
ittyV She came to him and put 
ier arms around his neck, a 
jrown-up woman with the manner of a child. "If I love you — ** 

"At! right" Powell thought 
desperately. "Remember Gaily 
Chervil? It's your turn now. What 
are you going to do? Admit the 
truth?" 

"Yes!" came from the stairs. 
Mary was descending with a traveling case in her hand. "Admit 
the truth." 

"She Isn't a peeper." 

"Forget that. She's a woman 
and she's in love with you. You're 
in love with her. For God's sake, 
give yourselves a chance" 

"A^chance for what? An affair 
it 1 get out of this Reich mesa 
alive? That's all it could be.** 

"She'll be grateful to settle for 
that. Ask me. I know." 

"And If I don't come out alive? 
She'll have nothing but half a 
memory of half a love." 

Powell laughed. "Baby! What 
makes you think I'm in love with 
you that way? I'm not. I've never 
been," 

"You are!" 

"Look at me. Look at Mary. 

You're ages older, aren't you? 

Can't you understand?" 
"For God's sake, Pres.'" 
"Sorry, Mary. Got to'hse you. M 
"Vm getting ready to say 

goodby, maybe for good. Isn't it 

bad enough for me already?" 



Barbara stared at Mary, then 
at Powell. She burst into tears 
and sobbed: "Oh, go away! Why 
don't you go away?" 

"Wef're going away, Barbara," 
Mary said. 

She took the girl's arm and led 
her to the door. 

"There's a Jumper waiting, 
Mary." 

"There's me waiting, Pres. For 
you. Always. And the Chervils fit

Image of four-leaf clover, rabbits' feet, horseshoes . . . 

He stood in the doorway watching the Jumper disappear into 
the steel-blue sky toward Kingston Hospital. He was exhausted, 
a little proud of himself for having made the sacrifice, intensely 
ashamed of himself for feeling 
proud, clearly melancholic. Look 
at that great, foul city of fourteen 
and one half million souls and 
not one soul for him — 

The first impulse came, a thin 
trickle of latent energy. He felt 
it distinctly and glanced at his 
watch. Ten-twenty. So soon? 
He'd better get ready. 

He turned into the house and 
ran up the stairs to his dressing 
room. His psyche began to throb 
and vibrate as he reached out 
for those tiny streams of latent 
energy. He changed his clothes, 
dressed for all weather, and — 

The energy came in torrents

now, a swirling sea of Mass Cathexis directed from each Esper, 
tuned to Powell. 

He was out of the house, wandering through the streets, blind, 
deaf, senseless, immersed in that 
boiling mass of latent energy . , . 
like a ship with sails caught in 
the nexus of a typhoon, fighting 
to convert a whirlpool of wind 
into the motive power that would 
lead to safety. So Powell fought 
to absorb that fearful torrent, to 
Capitalize that latent energy, to 
Cathectize and direct it toward 
the Demolition of Reich before 
it was too late.

shouted. He struggled upward, fighting the bedclothes and 
the restraining hands. "There is 
no what?!" 

"No more nightmares," a girl 
said. 

Reich opened his «yes. He was 
in a frilly bed with old-fashioned 
linen and blankets. Duffy Wyg&, 
starched and fresh, tried to thrust 
him back against the pillows. 

"I was awake," he said somberly. "I heard ... I don't know 
what I heard. Infinity and zero. 
Important things. Then I fell 
asleep here." 

"Correction," Duffy smiled. 
"You're awake now." 

"I'm asleep!" Reich shouted. 
"I've got to wake up, Duffy. I've 
got to get back to reality." 

Duffy bent over him and kissed 
him hard on the mouth. "How 
about this? Real?" 

"You don't understand. It's all 
been delusions. I've got to readjust before it's too late." 

Duffy threw up her hands. 
"First that damned doctor scares 
you into a faint. Then he swears 
you're patched up . . . and now 
look at you. Psychotic!" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Who scared me into a faint?'* 

"Rocky ''Martin. A doctor 
friend. In the square in front of 
police headquarters." 

"And you brought me here?** 

"Sure. It's the only way I 
could get you into my bed." 

Reich burst into laughter. 
"'Didn't you once ask to be 
dragged through the gutter, 
Duffy?" 

"I thought I could meet a better class of people." 

"You name the gutter .and you 
can have it. You want a gutter 
from here to Mars? You'll have 
it ! You want me to turn the 
System into a gutter? I'll do it!" 

"Dear man. So modest and so 
faung-over." 

"Drunk? Sure, I'm drunk." 
Reich fcirust his legs out of the 
bed and stood up, reeling slightly. 
He put his arm around her waist 
for support. "Why shouldn't I 
be drunk? I've licked D'Courtney. 
I've licked Powell. I've got sixty 
years of owning every damned 
world ahead of me. How'd you 
like to start a dynasty with me, 
Duffy?" 

"I wouldn't know how to go 
about starting dynasties." 

"You start with Ben Reich. 
First you marry him. Then — " 

"That's enough. When do I 
ctart?" 

"Then you have children and 
you watch Ben Reich take over 
D'Courtney and merge it with 
Sacrament. You watch the ene


mies go down . . . like this!" 
Reich kicked the leg of a busty 
vanity table. It crashed. "Case 
and Umbrel on Venus. Eaten!" 
Reich brought his fists down on 
a torso-shaped side table and 
smashed it. "United Transaction 
on Mars. Mashed and eaten!" He 
crushed a delicate chair. "The 
GCI Combine on Ganymede, Callisto and lo . . . Titan Chemical 
& Atomics . . . And then the 
smaller lice: the Guild of Peepers, the moralists, the patriots 
. . . eaten!" He toppled a marble 
nude from its pedestal. It shattered. 

"Clever up, Mr. Reich!" Duffy 
hung on his neck. "Why waste 
all that violence?" 

He lifted her in his arms and 
shook her until she squealed. 
"Parts of the System will taste 
sweet . . . like you, Duffy. Parts 
will stink to high heaven . . . but 
I'll gobble them alt" He laughed 
end crushed her against him. 
"We'll tear it all down, Duffy, 
and well build it all up to suit 
us. You and me and the dynasty." 

He carried her to the window, 
tore away the drapes. Outside, 
the city was in velvet darkness. 
Only the skyways and streets 
twinkled with lights, and the 
scarlet eyes of an occasional 
Jumper popped up over the jet 
skyline. 

"You out there!" Reich roared. 
"Can you hear me? All of you; 
sleeping and dreammg — you'll* 



• At AH -SCIENCE FICTION 



dream my dreams from now on!" 

He seized the sides of the window and poked his head far out 
into the night, twisting his neck 
to stare up. When he drew his 
head back into the room, his face 
wore a frustrated expression. 

"I want to yell at the stars/* 
he said. "They're not out tonight." 

Duffy looked at him curiously. 
"The what are not out?" 

"The stars. Look up at the sky. 
There's nothing but the Moon." 

"That's the way it always is," 
Duffy said. 

"It is not! Where are the stars?" 

"What stars?" 

"How the hell should I know 
their names? I'm not an astronomer. What's happened to 
the stars?" 

"What are stars?" Duffy asked. 

Reich seized her savagely. 
"Suns boiling and blazing with 
light. Thousands of them shining 
through the night. What the hell's 
the matter with you? Don't you 
understand?" 

Duffy shook her head. Her face 
was terrified. "I don't know what 
you're talking about, Ben." 

He shoved her away, went to 
the bathroom and locked himself 
in. While he was hurriedly bathing and dressing, he heard her 
calling Kingston Hospital on the 
phone; using a guarded voice. 

"Let her start explaining about 
the stars," Reich muttered, halfway betweett anger and terror. He 
caltine out into the bedroom- Duffy 



cut the phone off hastily and 
turned to him. "Wait here for 
me," he growled. "I'm going to 
find out." 

"Find out about what?" 

"About the stars!" he yelled. 

He rushed down to the street. 
On the empty footway, he paused 
and stared up again. There was 
the Moon. There was one brilliant red point of light . . . Mars. 
There was another . . . Jupiter. 
Nothing else. Blackness. It hung 
over his head, enigmatic, terrifying. 

He began to run, still staring 
upward. He turned a corner of 
the footway and collided with a 
woman. He held her arm and 
pointed up. "Look! Do you see 
what I see? The stars are gone!" 1 

"What's gone?" 

"The stars. Don't you see? 
They're gone." 

"I don't know what you're 
talkin' about, pilot. C'mon, let's 
have us a ball." 

He tore himself away from her 
claws and ran. Halfway down the 
footway was a public phone alcove. He stepped in and dialed 
Information. The screen lit and 
a robot voice spoke: "Your question ?" 

"What's happened to the 
stars?" Reich asked. "When did 
it happen? It must have been noticed by now. What's the explanation?" 

There: was a click, a pause. 
"Will you spell the word, please?""

"Star!'* Reieh roared. "S-t-a-r. 
Star!" 

"Noun or verb?" 

"God damn you! Noun!" 

"There is no information listed 
under that heading," the canned 
voice announced. 

Reich swore, then fought to 
control himself. "Where's the 
nearest observatory?" 

"The Lunar Observatory at 
Croton Park is situated thirty 
miles north. It may be reached 
by Jumper Route North Coordinate 227. The Lunar Observatory 
was endowed in the year two 
thousand — " 

Reich slammed down the 
phone. "No information listed under that heading! Are they all 
crazy ?" He ran out into the 
streets* searching for a Public 
Jumper. A eab cruised past and 
Reich signaled. It swooped to 
pick him up. 

"Northco 227," he snapped ac 
he stepped in. *'The Lunar Observatory." 

The cab jetted. Reich restrained 
himself for five minutes, then began casually: "Notice the sky?" 

"Why, mister?" 

"The stars are gone." 

Sycophantic laugh. 

"It's not supposed to be a joke," 
Reich said. "The stars are gone." 

"If it ain't a joke, it needs explaining," the driver said. "What 
the hell ere stars?" 

Before Reich could erupt, the 
cab landed him on the observa


tory grounds. He snapped, "Wait 
for me," and ran across the lawn. 

He entered and heard the low 
whine of the dome mechanism 
and the quiet click of the observatory clock. Except for the low 
glow of the clock-light, the room 
was in darkness. He could see 
the observer, a dim outline 
crouched over the eyepiece of the 
telescope. 

"Listen," Reich said in a low 
voice. "Sorry to bother you, but 
you must have noticed. What's 
happened? Where are the stars?" 

The figure straightened slowly 
and turned toward Reich. "There 
are no stars," it said. 

The Man With No Face! 

TJE1CH flew out of the door, 
down the steps and across 
the lawn to the waiting cab. He 
blundered aga inst the crystal 
cabin wall and fell flat. 

The driver pulled him to his 
feet. "You all right, Mac?" 

"I don't know," Reich groaned. 

"None of my business, but I 
think you ought to see a peeper." 

Reich gripped the man. "I'm 
Ben Reich of Sacrament." 

"I recognized you." 

"Good. You know what I can 
do for you if you do me a favor? 
Money, new job, anything you 
want ..." 

"You can't do anything for 
me, Mac. I already been adjusted at Kingston." 

"Better. An honest man. Will

you do me an important favor?" 
"Sure, Mac." 

"Go into that building. Take a 
lopk at the man behind the tele- . 
scope. A good look. Come back 
and describe him to me." 

The driver departed, was gone 
five minutes, then returned and 
reported : "Sixtyish. Bald. Got 
lines in his face kinda deep. His 
ears stick out and he's got what 
they call a weak chin." 

"It's nobody . . . nobody," 
Reich muttered. 

"What?" 

"About the stars." Reich said. 
■"You never heard of them? You 
never saw them? You don't know 
what I'm talking about?" 

"Now don't get overdriven, 
Mac. Tell you something. They 
taught me plenty up at Kingston, 
like sometimes you get a crazy 
notion. For instance, that people 
always had one eye and now all , 
of a sudden they got two." 

Reich stared at him. 

"So you run around yellin": 
"Where did they all of a sudden 
get two eyes?* And they say : 'We 
always got two eyes.' And you 
say: 'The hell we did. I distinctly 
remember everybody got one eye/ 
And, by God, you believe it and 
they have a hell of a time knockuV 
the , notion outa you." The driver 
thumped him firmly. "Seems to 
me,; Mac, like you're on a one-eye 
kick." 

"One eye," Reich repeated. 
"Two eyes. Tension, apprehension 



and dissension have begun." 

"What?" 

"I ' ve had a rough time the 
last month. Maybe you're right." 

"You want to stay here and 
mope about stars?" 

"What do I care about stars!. 
I've got the world. What do I 
care if a few delusions go with 
it?" 

"That's the way, Mac, Where 
to?" 

"The Royal Palace." 
"The which?" 

Reich laughed. "S T-t," 
he said, and laughed all L»ie flight 
through the dawn to Sacrament's 
soaring tower. 

r | 1 HE night staff was in the last 
■*■ drowsy stages of the 12-8 
shift when Reich bustled in. As 
Reich went to his desk, he was 
followed by secretaries and subsecretaries carrying the urgent 
agenda of the day. 

"Let all that wait," he ordered. 
"Call in all department heads and 
organizational supervisors. I'm 
going to make an announcement." 

This was the only reality . . . 
the annunciator bells, the muted 
commands, the quick filling of 
his office with so many awed 
faces. All this was a preview of 
the future, when bells would ring 
on planets and satellites, and 
world supervisors would scuttle 
to his desk with awe on their 
faces. 

"As you all know," Reich be


THE DEMOLISHED MAN

gan, "we of Sacrament have been 
battling the D'Courtney Cartel 
until Craye D'Courtney was 
killed. The road is open for us 
now. We can commence operation 
of Plan A A to take over the 
D'Courtney Cartel." 

He paused, waiting for the excited murmur that should respond 
to his announcement. There was 
no response. 

"Perhaps," he said, "some of 
you do not comprehend the size 
and importance of the job. Those 
of you that are city supervisors 
will become continental supervisors. Continental supervisors 
will become satellite chiefs. Present satellite chiefs will become 
planetary chiefs. From now on, 
Sacrament will dominate the 
Sblsfe System. From now on, all 
of us must think in terms of the 
Solar System." 

Reich faltered, alarmed by the 
blank looks. He singled out the 
chief secretary. "What the hell's 
the matter? Bad news I haven't 
heard yet?" 

**N-no, Mr. Reich." 

"Then what's frabbing you? 
This is something we've all been 
waiting for. What's wrong with 

it?" 

"I've n-never heard of the organization, Mr. Reich. I . . . 
We . . . " The chief secretary 
turned around for support. Before Reich's unbelieving eyes, the 
entire staff shook their heads in 
mystification. 



"D'Courtney on Mars!" Reich 
shouted. 

"On where, sir?" 

"One of the ten planets. Fourth 
from the Sun. Mercury, Venus, 
Earth, Mars ! A hundred and 
forty-one million miles from the 
Sun! Mars!" 

They backed away slightly 
from Reich. He darted at the secretaries and tore the business 
papers from their hands. "You've 
got information about D'Courtney on Mars there. My God, 
we've been fighting D'Courtney 
for the last ten years!" • 

He clawed through the papers. 
There was not one reference to 
D'Courtney or Mars. There was 
no reference to Venus, Jupiter, 
the Moon, the other satellites. 

"I've got memos in my desk,* 1 
Reich shouted. "Hundreds of 
them! You're pulling something 
on me ..." 

He yanked out desk drawers. 
There was a stunning explosion. 
Fragments of flying wood slashed 
the staff, and Reich was hurled 
back against the window. 

"The Man With No Face!" 
Reich cried. He shook his head 
feverishly, and clung to the first 
problem. "Where are the files? 
I'll show you in the files . . . 
D'Courtney and Mars and all 
the rest. And I'll' sh6w the Man 
With No Facei too." 

He burst into the- file vaults, 
tore out rack after r^ckr scattering papers, clusters' of ' !; piezo'

GALAXY S'C I E N C £ f I C T I <J N 



crystals, microfilm, molecular 
transcripts. There was no reference to D'Courtney or Mars, none 
to Venus, Jupiter, Mercury, the 
asteroids, the satellites. 

Three burly gentlemen from 
Relations came trotting into the 
vaults. 

"Easy now, Mr. Reich," one 
said. "Easy .. . . " 

"Get away from me!" 

"Easy. It's all right, sir." 

They deployed strategically 
while the hustle and the bustle 
increased and the bells sounded 
and voices far off called: "Get 
his doctor." "Somebody call 
Kingston," "Did you notify the 
police?" "No, don't. No scandal." 
"Get Legal!" "Isn't the Infirmary 
open yet?" 

Reich overturned file* in the 
path of the burly gentlemen, 
raced through the office to the 
outside corridor and the Vertical 
Pneumatique, where he punched 
57. The door opened. He stepped 
into space and felt the circular 
steel plate snap again his soles 
and then drop him to the S7th 
floor. 

The Sacrament laboratory was 
in darkness. Still breathing heavily, he staggered to the lab library, snapped on the lights and 
went to the reference alcove. A 
sheet of frosted crystal, slanted 
like a drawing board, was set 
before a desk chair. There was a 
complicated panel of control buttons alongside it. 



Reich seated himself and 
punched ready. The crystal lit 
up and a canned voice spoke from 
an overhead speaker: "Class?" 
Reich punched science. "Section?" Reich punched astronomy. 
"Your question?" 

"The Universe." 

"The term universe in its complete physical sense applies to alt 
matter in existence." 

"What matter is in existence?" 

"Matter is gathered into aggregates ranging in size from the 
smallest atom to the largest collection of matter known to astronomers." 

"What is the largest collection 
of matter known to astronomers?" 
Reich punched diagram. 

"The Sun." The crystal plate 
displayed a dazzling picture of 
the Sun in speed-up action. 

"But what about the others? 
The stars?" 

"There are no stars." 

"The planets?" 

"There are no planets." 

"The Moon?" 

"There is no Moon." 

Reich took a deep, trembling 
breath. "We'll try it again. Go 
back to the Sun." 

The Sun appeared again in the 
crystal. "The Sun is the largest 
collection of matter known to 
astronomers," the canned voice 
began. Suddenly it stopped. The 
picture began to fade slowly. The 
voice spoke. "There is no Sun.** 

The model disappeared, leav

ing behind it an after-image that 
looked up at Reich . . . looming, 
silent, horrible . . . The Man With 
No Face. 

Reich picked up the chair and 
smashed it down on that frightful 
image. He blundered out of the 
library into the corridor. At the 
Vertical Pneumatique, he punched 
street. The door opened, he staggered in, was dropped 57 stories 
to the Main Hall of Sacrament 
Tower. 

It was filled with early workers 
hurrying to their offices. As Reich 
pushed past them, he caught the* 
astonished glances at his cut and 
bleeding face. Then he was aware 
of a dozen uniformed Sacrament 
guards closing in on him. He ran 
down the hall, slipped into the 
revoking doors and whirled 
through to the footway. There he 
jerked to a stop as though he 
had run into white-hot iron. 

The street lights were lit; the 
skyways twinkled; Jumper eyes 
floated up and down; the shops 
were blazing . . . and overhead 
there was nothing but a deep, 
black fathomless infinity. 

"The Sun! Where's the Sun?" 

Then the first of the guards 
came through the revolving door 
and he sprinted through an arcade of brilliant, busy shops. Beyond the arcade was the entrance 
of a Vertical Pneumatique to the 
skyway. Reich leaped in, was 
lofted 70 stories. 

There was a small car park 



shelved onto the face of Sacrament Tower, with a ramp leading 
into the skyway. Reich flung sovereigns to the attendant and got 
into a car. He pressed GO. The 
car went. At the foot of the runway, he pressed left. The car 
turned left and continued. That 
was all the control" he had — left, 
right; stop, go. The rest was automatic. Moreover, cars were 
strictly limited to the skyways. 
He might spend hours racing in 
circles high over the city. 

He glanced alternately over his 
shoulder and up at the sky. There 
was no Sun ... and they went 
about their business as though 
there had never been any. He 
shuddered. Was this more of the 
one-eye kick? 

Suddenly the car slowed and 
stopped. He was marooned in 
the middle of the skyway, halfway between Sacrament Tower 
and the Chanin Building. 

Reich hammered on the control studs. There was no response. 
He leaped out and raised the tail 
hood to inspect the pickup. Then 
he saw the guards far down the 
skyway, running toward him, and 
he understood. These cars were 
powered by broadcast energy. 
They'd cut the broadcast off at 
the car park and were coming 
after him. 

Reich stumbled toward the 
Chanin Building. The skyway 
tunneled through the building 
and was lined with shops, res

taurants, a Panty theater — and 
there was a travel office! He could 
grab a ticket, get into a one-man 
capsule and have himself slotted 
to any of the takeoff fields. He 
needed a little time to reorganize 
and he had a house in Paris. 

He leaped across the center 
island, dodged past cars and ran 
into the office. It looked like a 
miniature bank. A short counter. 
A grilled window protected 
by burglar-proof plastic. Reich 
slapped gold coins down on the 
counter. 

"Ticket to Paris," he said. 
"Keep the change." 

"There is no such place," came 
the reply. 

Reich stared through the 
cloudy plastic and saw . . . looking, looming, silent . . . the Man 
With No Face. 

Skull pounding, he ran blindly 
on to the skyway, shied feebly 
from an oncoming car, and was 
struck down into enveloping 
darkness — 

ABOLISH: 
(miner au>gy, petrology, geology 
and physiography) 
EXPUNGE: 
(meteorology, hydrology and 
seismology) 
ERASE: 
(paleontology, stratigraphy 
and paleogeography) 
ANNUL . ; . 

A hand was placed over his 



mouth. Reich opened his eyes. He 
was in a small tiled room, an 
emergency police station. He was 
lying on a white examination 
table. Around him were the 
guards, three uniformed police, 
unidentified strangers. 

The stranger removed his 
hand from Reich's mouth. "It's 
all right," he said gently. "I'm a 
doctor." 

"Are you a peeper? I need a 
peeper. I need somebody inside 
my head to prove I'm right." 

"What's he want?" a policeman asked. 

"I don't know. He said a 
peeper." The doctor turned back 
to Reich. "What's a peeper?" 

"An Esper. A mind reader. 
A—" 

The doctor smiled. "Show of 
high spirits. Many patients do 
that after accidents. We call it 
gallows humor ..." 

"Listen," Reich said desperately. "My name is Reich. Ben 
Reich of Sacrament. You know 
me. I want to confess. Take me to 
Preston Powell." 

"Who's Powell?" 

"What do you want to confess?" 

"I murdered Craye D'Courtney last month. In Maria Beaumont's house. I want to tell 
Powell " 

The police looked at each other 
in surprise. One of them drifted 
to a corner and picked up an oldfashioned hand phone: "Captain? 



THI DEMOLISHED MAN 



Got a character here. Calls himseld Ben Reirh of Sacrament. 
Claims he killed a party named 
Craye D'Courtney last month." 
After a pause, he grunted and 
hung up. "A nut," he said. 

"Listen — " Reich began. 

"Is he all right?" the policeman 
ssked the doctor. 

"Just shaken a little." 

"Listen!" Reich shouted. 

The policeman yanked him to 
his feet and propelled him toward 
the door of the station. "There 
ain't no Preston Powell on the 
force. There ain't no D'Courtney 
killing on the books. Now, out!" 
And he hurled Reich into the 
street. 

Reich stumbled, then regained 
his balance and stood still, numb, 
lost. A few street lights were lit. 
The skyways were extinguished. 
There were great gaps shorn in 
the skyline. 

He began to lurch down the 
broken streets with arms clutching his belly. 

"Cab!" he yelled. "Taxicab!" 
Jumper! Where is everything? 
Cab!" 

There was nothing. 

"Isn't there anybody can hear 
me? I'm sick. I need help . . . 
Got to get home." 

There was nothing. 

He moaned again. Then he 
tittered, weakly, inanely. He sang 
in a defiant voice: "Eight, sir, 
five, sir, one. sir! Tenser, said 
tensor . . . tension, 'prehension, 




'sension have b-begun!" 

He gripped T8's shaking elbow and marched him through 
Beaumont House. As he walked 
he called plaintively: "Hey, where 
is everybody? Maria!" 

T8 emitted a hysterical sob. 
Reich shook him roughly. "Play 
up! We'll be out of here in five 
minutes. Then you can start worrying." 

"If they find the body before 
we leave, we're sunk." 
"Who'll find the body?" 
"Th£ guards." 
"They've been ionized." 
"Servants." 

"They won't leave the kitchens 
till the Sardine game is over. I 



144 




 




tell you we'll be safe in five 
minutes." 

"But if we're trapped here, we 
won't be able to get the girl. 
We'll— " 

"We won't be trapped." Reich 
pushed open the door of the projection room. "Hey, where is everybody?" 

No answer. 

There was no door, no projection room. He was standing at 
9 Park South, looking for the 
Beaumont Mansion, the site of 
D'Courtney's death . . . and Maria Beaumont, shrill, decadent, 
reassuring, 

There was a black tundra. Unfamiliar desolation. Nothing. 



"For God's sake!" he cried. 
"Where is everything? Stop this 
crazy Sardine game! Bring it all 
back! Fill up the empty space!" 

From far across the desolation, 
a figure approached , , . looking, 
looming, silent. The Man With 
No, Face. Reich watched it approach, paralyzed. 

Then the shadowy figure spoke: 
"There is no space. There is 
nothing." 

The screaming in Reich's ears 
was his voice, and the hammering was his heart. He was running, running down a yawning 
alien path, devoid of life, devoid 
of space, running while there was 
still time, time, time — 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



147 



He ran headlong into a figure 
of black shadows. A figure without a face. A figure that said: 
"There is no time. There is nothing." 

Reich backed away He turned. 
He fell. He crawled feebly through 
eternal emptiness, shrieking: 
"Powell! Duffy! Hassop! Quizzard! T8! Church! Where is everybody? Where is everything? 
For the love of God!" 

And he was face to face with 
the Man With No Face, who said: 
"There is no God. There is nothing except you and me." 

Reich raised his eyes and stared 
deep into the face of his deadly 
enemy, the man he could not 
escape, the terror of his nightmares, the destroyer of his existence. 

It Vvas — 

Himself. 

D'Courtney. 

Both. 

Two faces, blending into one. 
Ben D'Courtney. Craye Reich. 
D' Courtney -Reich. 

He could make no sound. He 
could make no move. There was 
neither time nor space nor matter. 
There was nothing left but dying 
thought. 

"Fatlier?" 

"Son." 

" You are me?" . 
"We are us." 

"I don't understand. What's 
happened?" 

"You lost the game, Ben." 



"The Sardine Game?" 

"The Cosmic Game." 

"I won. I owned every bit of 
the world." 

"'And therefore you lose. We 
Jose" 

"Lose what?" 

"Survival." 

"I can't understand!" 

"My part of us understands, 
Ben. You would understand, too, 
if you hadn't driven me from 
you." 

"How did I dri ve you from 

me?" 

"With every corruption in 
you." 

"You say that, you betrayer?" 

"That was without passion, 
Ben. That was to destroy you 
before you could destroy us, to 
help you lose the world and win 
the game" 

"What game? What Cosmic 
Game?" 

"The maze. The labyrinth. The 
galaxies, the stars, the Sun, the 
planets, the moons . . that was 
the problem box we were to solve. 
We were the only reality. All the 
rest was make-believe, toys for 
us to play with, dolls, puppets, 
stage- settings, pretended passions. 
It was a make-believe reality 
for us to solve." 

"I conquered it. I owned it." 

"And you failed to solve it. I 
don't know what the solution is, 
but it's not theft, terror, hatred, 
lust, murder, rapine. You failed, 
and it's all been abolished, de

jnolished, disbanded ..." 

"Then what's to become of us?" 
''We're disbanded too." 
"Why? Who We we? What are 

we?" 

"Did the seed from our makebelieve universe know who or 
what it was when it did not find 
fertile soil and {ailed nature's 
survival test? Did the dying sperm 
know who or what it was when 
it failed to find the egg? Does it 
matter who or what we are? We 
have failed. We are ended." 

"But we did exist!" 

"Perhaps if we had solved it, 
Ben, it might have remained real, 
and all that we knew and loved 
might be with us still. But it is 
ended. Reality has turned into 
might-have-been, and you have 
awakened at last . . . to nothing." 

"We'll go back! We'll try it 
again!" 

"There is no going back. It is 
ended." 

"Well find a way. There must 
be something ..." • 
"There is nothing. It is ended." 
"Is this death?" 

"How can there be death when 
there never was life? It is ended. 
We are merging, fading, disappearing. It is — *' 

Ended.

*X ,I HEY found the two men next 
morning, in the gardens overlooking the old Harlem Canal. 



Powell was seated cross-legged on 
the wet turf, his face shriveled, 
his respiration almost gone, his 
pulse almost faded. Reich was 
curled into a tight fetal ball, completely catatonic. 

They rushed Powell to his home 
on Hudson Ramp, where the entire Guild Lab team first sweated 
over him and then congratulated 
themselves on the first successful 
Mass Cathexis Measure in the 
history of the Esper Guild. There 
was no hurry for Reich. In due 
course and with proper procedure, 
his inert body was transported to 
Kingston Hospital. 

Eight days later, Powell arose, 
bathed, dressed, successfully defeated his nurses in single combat and left the house. He made 
one stop at Sucre et Cie., emerged 
with a parcel and then proceeded 
to headquarters to make his personal report to Commissioner 
Crabbe. 

On the way up, he poked his 
head into $$on's office. 

"Hi Chas. Did Peetcy back us 
tip on the D'Courtney murder 
motive?" 

"Lock, stock «> barrel. Trial 
took one hour. Reich's going 
through Demolition now." 

"That's nice. I'd better go up 
now and s-p-e-l-1 it out for 
Crabbe." 

"What you got under your 
arm?" 

"Present." 

"For Crabbe?"

"The kind I'd give him art 

against the taw." 
"See you." 

Powell went up to Crabbe's 
ebony and silver office. Crabbe 
was properly solicitous, but stiff. 
The D'Courtney case had not improved his bitter relations with 
Powell. 

"Conviction," he said belligerently. "Damned if I see proper 
evidence." 

"It was a remarkably complex 
case, sir," Powell replied tact' 
fully. "None of us could under „ stand it. Even Reich himself was 
not aware of why he had murdered D'Courtney. The only one 
who grasped the case was the 
Prosecution Transistor Computer." 

'IPeetcy did? How?" 

"When we ran our final data 
through the first time, Peetcy told 
us that the 'passion motive' was 
insufficiently documented. We'd 
all been assuming profit motive. 
So had Reich. That was his conscious camouflage for die real 
passion motive. It couldn't hold 
up as evidence because he offered 
merger to D'Courtney — and 
D'Courtney accepted! Reich misunderstood the message. He had 
to. He had to go on believing 
he murdered D'Courtney for 
money." 

"Why?" 

"Because he couldn't face the 
real motive ..." 
"Which was?" 



"D'Courtney was his father.*" 
"What!" Crabbe stared. "His 
father? His flesh and blood?" 

"Yes, sir. It was all there before us. We just couldn't see it 
. . . because Reich himself 
couldn't see it. That estate on 
Callisto, for instance, the one 
Reich used to lure Dr. J^maine 
off the planet — Reich inherited it 
from his mother, who'd receive it 
from D'Courtney. We all assumed 
Reich's father had chiseled it out 
of D'Courtney in some kind of 
transaction and placed it in his 
wife's name. We were wrong. 
D'Courtney had given it to 
Reich's mother because it was 
his love-gift to the mother of his 
child." 

Crabbe opened his mouth, then 
closed it. 

"And there were other signposts. D'Courtney's suicide drive, 
produced by intense guilt sensations of desertion. He had abandoned his son. It was tearing 
him apart. Now add Barbara 
D'Courtney's half-twin image of 
herself and Ben Reich. Somehow she felt they were halfbrother and sister. Reich's inability to kill Barbara — he knew it, 
too, deep in his unconscious. 
He wanted to destroy the hateful 
father who had rejected him, but 
he could not bring himself to 
harm his sister." 

"When did you unearth all 
this?" 

"When Reich attacked me for 



SALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



setting those boobytraps." 

"Damn it, Powell, someone had 
to set them I If you didn't, who 
did?" 

"Reich himself, sir." 

"Reich!" 

"He murdered his father, which 
discharged his hatred. But his 
conscience could not permit him 
to go unpunished for such a horrible crime. Since the police apparently were unable to punish 
him, his conscience took over. 
That was the meaning of Reich's 
nightmare image." 

"The Man With No Face?" 

"Yes, Commissioner. It was the 
symbol of Reich's real relationship to D'Courtney. It had no 
face because Reich could not accept the truth. It was first the 
threat of punishment for what 
he contemplated. Then it became 
the punishment itself for the 
murder." 

"The boobytraps?" 

"Exactly. Reich set those traps 
for himself without ever realizing 
it ... in brief departures from 
conscious reality. The tricks of 
the unconscious are fantastic." 

"But if Reich himself knew 
none of this, how did you get at 
it, Powell?" 

"We used the Mass Cathexis 
Measure, sir. It's difficult to explain, but I'll do my best. Every 
human being has a psyche composed of latent and capitalized 
energy. Latent energy is our reserve . .. . the uptapped natural 



resources of our mihd. Capitalized 
energy is that latent energy which 
we call up and put to work. Most 
of us use only a small portion 
of our latent energy." 

"I understand." 

"When the Esper Guild uses 
the Mass Cathexis Measure, every 
Esper opens his psyche, so to 
speak, and contributes his latent 
energy to a pool. One Esper alone 
taps this pool and becomes the 
canal for the latent energy. He 
capitalizes it and puts it to work. 
He can accomplish tremendous 
things ... if he can control it. 
It's a difficult and dangerous operation. About on a par with jetting to the Moon with a stick 
of dynamite — er — riding on dynamite sticks." 

Suddenly Crabbe grinned. "I 
wish I were a peeper," he said. 
"I'd like to get the real image 
in your mind." 

"You've got it already, sir.** 
Powell grinned back. An entente 
cordial had been established between them for the first time. "It 
was necessary," Powell continued, 
"to bring Reich face to face with 
the Man With No Face. We had 
to make him see the truth before 
we could get the truth. Using the 
pool of latent energy, I built a 
common neurotic concept for 
Reich . . . the illusion that he 
alone in the world was real." 

"Why, I've often — is that common?" 

"One of the run-of-the-mill es


cape pattern* When life get* 
tough for you, you take refuge 
in the idea that it's all a giant 
hoax. Reich had the seeds of 
that in him already. I simply 
forced them. I tore it all down 
and I very nearly tore myself 
apart doing it . . . but I left 
Reich alone in nothingness with 
the Man With No Face. Then, 
because there was nowhere else 
to look, he looked into the face 
and saw himself and his father. 
Once we had that, we had everything we needed." 

Powell picked up his parcel and 
arose. Crabbe jumped up and escorted ^him to the door with a 
friendly hand on his shoulder. 

"You've done a phenomenal 
job, Powell. Really phenomenal. 
All J can say is that it must be a 
wonaerful thing to be an Esper. 
You must all be very happy." 

Powell paused at the door. 
"Would you be happy to live 
your life in a hospital, Commissioner?" 

"A hospital?" 

"That's where we Espers live 
... all of us. In the psychiatric 
ward. Without escape, without 
refuge. Be grateful you're not a 
peeper, sir. Be grateful that you 
see only the outward man. Be 
grateful that you never see the 
passions, the hatreds, the jealousies, the malice, the sicknesses. 
The world will be a wonderful 
place when everyone's a peeper 
and properly adjusted. But until 



then, be grateful you're blind." 

He left headquarters, hired a 
Jumper and was jetted north toward Kingston Hospital. He sat 
in the cabin with the parcel on 
his knees, gazing down at the 
magnificent Hudson valley. 

Kingston Hospital came into 
view, acre upon rolling acre of 
magnificent landscaping, solar iums, pools, lawns, athletic fields, 
dormitories, clinics, all in exquisite neo-classic design. As the 
Jumper descended, Powell could 
make out the figures of patients 
and attendants, bronzed, active, 
laughing, playing. 

He checked in at the Visitors 
Office, found Barbara D'Courtney's location and started across 
the grounds. He was weak, but 
felt impelled to leap hedges, vault 
gates, run races. He had awakened from his siege with Reich 
with a sudden knowledge that 
exhilarated him. It was a fact 
always known to him, he realized, 
but deliberately concealed by his 
sense of responsibility. 

*'I really have got too damned 
much super-ego," he grumbled. "It takes itself so seriously." 

They saw each other at the 
same moment, across a broad 
stretch of lawn flanked by fieldstone terraces and brilliant rockgardens. She flew toward him, 
waving, and he ran toward her. 
Then, as they approached, both 
were stricken with shyness. They 
stopped a few feet apart, not 



144 




 



daring to look at each other. 
"Hello." 

"Hello, Barbara." He paused. 
"Let's get into the shade." 

They turned toward the terrace 
wall. Powell glanced at her from 
the corner of his eye. She was 
alive as he had never seen her. 
And the urchin expression in her 
face — the expression that he had 
imagined was a phase of her 
Deja Eprouve ^development — was 
still there. She looked inexpressibly mischievous, high-spirited, 
fascinating. But she was adult. 
He did not know her. 

"I'm being discharged this evening," Barbara said. 

"I know." 

They sat down on a stone 
bench. She looked at him with 
grave eyes. "I want to tell you 
how grateful I am." 

"Please, Barbara. You're making me uncomfortable." 

"Am I?" 

"I knew you so intimately as — 
well, as a child. Now — " 

"Now I'm grown up again." 
"Yes;' 

"You must get to know me 
better. Shall we say tea tomorrow 
at five? Informal." 

"Listen," Powell said desperately. "I helped dress you more 
than once. And comb your hair. 
And brush your teeth." 

She waved her hand airily. 

"You liked fish, but you hated 
lamb. You hit me in the eye with 
a chop.' 1 '* 

THE DEMOLISHED MAN ' 



"That was ages ago, Mr. Powell." 

"That was two weeks ago, Miss 
D'Courtney." 

She arose with magnificent 
poise. "Really, Mr. Powell! If you 
feel impelled to cast chronographical aspersions . . ." She stopped 
and looked at him. The urchin 
appeared again in her face. 
"Chronographical?" she inquired. 
* He dropped the parcel and 
caught her in his arms. 

"Mr. Powell," she murmured. 
"Hello, Mr. Powell" 

"My God, Barbara — Baba, 
dear. For a moment I thought 
you meant it." 

"I was paying you back for 
being grown up." 

"You always were a vindictive 
kid." 

"You always were a mean 
daddy." She leaned back and 
looked at him. "Mary Noyes told 
me. Everything." 

"Oh. She did?" 

Barbara nodded. "She was 
right. I'll settle for anything." 

He laughed, the exhilaration 
bubbling vibrantly from him. 
"You won't have to settle for 
anything. Sit down. I want to 
ask you something." 

She sat down. 

On his lap. 

"I have to go back to that 
night," he said. 

"In Beaumont House?" 
He nodded. 

"It's not easy to talk about," 

Hi 



under his arm. "This, for example, woutd have been called 
gushing sentimentally over an 
outlaw of society." 

Jeems watched silently, sympathetically, as Powell held out 
the package to what was left of 
Reich. "It's a present for you, 
Ben. Take it." The creature glowered at Powell and then at the 
box.' At last the clumsy hands 
took the gift, tore away the wrappings, scooped up a handful of 
Sucre et Cie.'s magnificent candies and stuffed them into the 
lax mouth. 

"He's done all right in the gift 
department," Jeems said, nodding 
at the flowers, piezo crystal recordings, pieces of sculpture, a 
cage of small, active animals from 
VeAus, and exotic Ampro plants 
that covered the tables and 
shelves in the room. 

"From Commissioner Crabbe, 
old T-H himself. Dr. Wilson 
J^maine," said Powell, reading 
the cards. He paused at one. 
"Jeremy Church, too. After the 
way Church hated Reich for getting him expelled from the Esper 
Guild . . . damn it, Johnny, it's 
hard to believe, isn't it?" 

"No," Jeems said. "Why should 



it be? A criminal is a sick person. 
Naturally you put him in the 
hospital and send him gifts. How 
else should any criminal be 
treated?" 

"How else indeed?" Powell repeated gently. 

Out of the chaos in Reich's 
stripped mind came a fragment of 
thought; "Powell — peeper — Powell — friend ..." 

It was so sudden, so unexpected, so passionately grateful 
that Powell gripped Reich's 
shoulder and tried to smile, then 
had to turn and hurry out toward 
the pavilion and Barbara. 

One ill mind had been rescued. 
There had been fear and frustration, danger to the Solar System 
and to Powell and Barbara and 
to Reich himself, death for an 
old, guilt-ridden man too tired 
to live. But one sick personality 
had been saved. Some day it 
would be the entire human race. 
Until then, the Espers had to 
nurse and guard and guide a 
world that was diseased with 
psychic blindness. 

Was it worth it? 

Yes, Powell decided without 
hesitation, it was.

She put her head on his 

shoulder at . last, shaken, yet 
somehow at peace. Then the 
urchin smile came to her face as 
she glanced at the package he 
had put down on the bench beside him. 

"A present?" she wheedled. 
**For Baba?" 

He stood up, suddenly remembering. "No, of course not. It's 
for someone who needs it a good 
deal more.** He took her chin in 
his hand and kissed her again. 
"Run back to your pavilion and 
wait for me. There's somebody 
I've got to see. I'll be along soon 
... to take you home." 

She scampered off across the 
lawn, dangerously looking back 
at him instead of where she was 
going. Powell watched her go, 
partly to make sure she didn't 
crash into anything, mostly to 
feel the warmth of her love washing over his mind. Then he went 
to the Demolition Section of 
Kingston Hospital. 

When a man 'was Demolished 
at Kingston, his entire psyche 
was destroyed. The series of osmotic injections began with the 
topmost strata of cortical synapses and slowly worked down, 
switching off every circuit, extinguishing every memory, destroying every particle of the 
pattern that had been built up 
since birth. 

But this was not the pain nor 
the dread of Demolition. The hor


ror Jay in the fact that the consciousness was never lost ; that 
as the psyche was wiped out, the 
mind was aware of* the slow, 
backward death, until at last it, 
too, disappeared and awaited the 
rebirth. It was an eternity of farewells ... an agonizing funeral 
of oneself. And as Powell stood 
alongside Ben Reich's bed, he saw 
the awareness, the pain, the despair in those blinking, twitching 
eyes. 

Dr. Johnny Jeems put his hand 
on Reich's arm. "He's a lusty lad. 
We have great hopes for him." 

Reich squalled and writhed. 

"How's the treatment coming?" 
Powell asked anxiously. 

"Wonderful. Ought to be ready 
for rebirth in a year." 

"He's a great guy. We need 
men like him. It would have been 
a shame to lose Ben Reich." 

"Lose him?" Jeems repeated in 
astonishment. "How?" 

"Three or four hundred years 
ago, Johnny, cops caught people 
like Reich to kill them. Capital 
punishment, they called it." 

"It doesn't make sense, a man 
who's got the talent and guts 
to buck society obviously is valuable potentially. If you don't 
straighten him out and turn him 
into a plus value — hell, it would 
be a criminal human waste!" 

"They were pretty good at 
criminal human waste in those 
days," Powell said. He took the 
beautifully wrapped package from

she whispered miserably. 

"It won't take a minute. You 
were lying in bed, asleep. Suddenly you woke up and rushed 
into the Orchid room. You remember the rest . . . " 

"1 remember." 

"One question. What was the 
cry that woke you?" 
"You know." 

"I want you to say it. Say it 
out loud." 

"Do you think it's — it's going 
to send me into hysteria again?" 

"Say it." 

After a long pause, she said in 
a low voice, "Help, Barbara," and 
waited in fear. Nothing happened. 
She relaxed, though afraid. 

"Who shouted that?'" 

"My father, of course.** 

"^Ie couldn't shout, Barbara. 
His throat was gone. Cancer. He 
could barely whisper." 

"But I heard him!" 

*'You peeped him." 

She stared. 

"You peeped him," Powell repeated gently. "Your father cried 
out on the telepathic level. You 
heard him. There was no other 
way you could have heard him 
except telepathically." 

"But that would mean I'm an 
Esper," she objected. "I'm not 
one at all." 

"In spite of proof that you 
are?" 

"It's just your opinion," she 
said insistently. "Maybe just a 
hope." 



"Do you love me?" Powell , shot 
at her. 

"I love you, of course," she 
answered, "but I think you're inventing excuses to — " 

"Who asked you?" 

"Asked me what?" 

"If you loved me." 

"Why, you just — " 

"I didn't say anything," he told 
her quietly. "I thought my question; you peeped me. You were 
unconsciously peeping Mary and 
me all the while you were in my 
house. You peeped Reich when 
he came there to set a boobytrap 
for me. Don't you understand 
now, Barbara?" 

"Oft, if it were only true!** 

"it is, darling. You won't have 
to settle for anything short of us. 
You're a latent Esper. You'll be 
trained, of course ... as a Guild 
member and my wife. You heard 
me, didn't you?" 

"Yes, Preston," she whispered. 

"One of the first things you'll 
learn is that words aren't necessary," he said. "Now, for example." 

Their kiss was long and deep, 
but not a fraction as urgent and 
hungry as the need they read 
clearly in each other. This, he let 
her realize without words, while 
their lips were still together, was 
why an Esper could love only 
another Esper . . . and why Esper 
love was to deaf-mute love as 
animal instinct was to human 
reasoning.

Odd John 

By Olaf Slapiedon 

"Odd John" was the nickname given this itrange youth . • . 
and odd he certainly was. With his incredibly gifted skill* and 
hii awesomely developed mind, he could have attained power, 
fame, money — an entire nation or even the worldl 

But it would have been like a genius ruling an asylum of 
Imbeciles. For Odd John was not of the human race; he belonged 
to the next stage of evolution — Homo Superior! 

He could not be the only one, he reasoned. There must be 
others like himself. But where would he find them? And if he 
did, would they agree to his plan to breed . only among themselves ... to create the race that would some day replace Homo 
Sapiens? And what would mankind, with his powerful weapons 
and unleashed fear, do to stop the threat? 

Many authors have tried to write the story of Homo Superior 
and foiled — just as Pithecanthropus, describing Modern Man, 
would find it an impossible job. But Stapledon succeeded! This 
Is THE masterpiece of superman stories, truly a great work of 
science fictionl

THERE are some things that can not 
be generally told — things you ought 
to know. Great truths are dangerous 
to some — but factors for personal 
power and accomplishment la the

Behind the tales of the miracles and 
mysteries of the ancients, lie centuries of their secret probing into 
nature's laws — their amazing discoveries of the hidden processes of man's 
mind, and the mastery of life's prob~

avoid their destruction by mass fear 
and ignorance, these facts remain a 
useful heritage for the thousands of 
men and women who privately use 
them in their homes today.
