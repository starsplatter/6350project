THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT by Robert A. Heinlien


AT first Potiphar Breen did not notice the girl who 
was undressing. 

She was standing at a bus stop 
only ten feet away. He was indoors, but that would not have 
kept him from noticing; he was 
seated in a drugstore booth adjacent to the bus stop; there was 
nothing between Potiphar and 
the young lady but plate glass 
and an occasional pedestrian. 

Nevertheless he did not look up 
when she began to peel. Propped 
up in front of him was a Los 
Angeles Times ; beside it. still 
unopened, were the Herald- Express and the Daily News. He 
was scanning the newspaper carefully, but the headline stories 
got only a passing glance. 

He noted the maximum 
and minimum temperatures in 
Brownsville. Texas, and entered 
them in a neat black notebook. 
He did the same with the closing 
prices of three blue chips and 
two dogs on the New York Exchange, as well as the total number of shares. 

He then began a rapid sifting 
of minor news stories, from time 
to time entering briefs of them 
in his little book. 

The items he recorded seemed 
randomly unrelated — among 
them a publicity release in which 
Miss National Cottage Cheese 
Week announced that she intended to marry and have twelve 
children by a man who could 
prove that he had been a lifelong 
vegetarian, a circumstantial but 
wildly unlikely Flying Saucer 
report, and a call for prayers 
for rain throughout Southern 
California. 

Potiphar had just written down 
the names and addresses of three 
residents of Watts, California, 
who had been miraculously 
healed at a tent meeting of the 
God-is-All First Truth Brethren 
by the Reverend Dickie Bottomley, the eight-year-old evangelist, 
and was preparing to tackle the 
Herald- Express, when he glanced 
over his reading glasses and saw 
the amateur ecdysiast on the 
Street corner outside. 

He stood up, placed his glasses 
in their case, folded the newspapers and put them carefully in 
his right coat pocket, counted out 
the exact amount of his check 
and added fifteen per cent. He 
then took his raincoat from hook, placed it over his arm, and 
went outside. 

BY now the girl was practically 
down to the buff. It seemed 
to Potiphar Breen that she had 
quite a lot of buff, yet she had 
not pulled much of a house. The 
corner newsboy had stopped 
hawking his disasters and wai 
grinning at her, and a mixed pair 
of transvestites who were apparently waiting for the bus had 
their eyes on her. 1 None of the 
passers-by stopped. They glanced 
at her, and then, with the selfconscious indifference to the unusual of the true Southern Cali* 
fornian, they went on their 
various ways. 

The transvestites were frankly 
staring. The male member of the 
team wore a frilly feminine 
blouse, but his skirt was a conservative Scottish kilt. His female companion wore a business 
suit and Homburg hat; she stared 
with lively interest. 

As Breen approached, the girl 
hung a scrap of nylon on the bus 
stop bench, then reached for her 
shoes. A police officer, looking 
hot and unhappy, crossed with 
the lights and came up to them. 

"Okay," he said in a tired 
voice, "that'll be all, lady. Get 
them duds back on and clear out 
of here." 

The female transvestite took a 
igar out of her mouth. "Just 
what business is it of yours, officer?" she asked. 

The cop turned to her. "Keep 
out of this!" He ran his eyes 
over her getup, and that of her 
companion. "I ought to run both 
of you in, too." 

The transvestite raised her eyebrows. "Arrest us for being 
clothed, arrest her for not being. 
1 think I'm going t» like this." 
She turned to the girl, who was 
standing still and saying nothing, 
as if she were puzzled by what 
was going on. "I'm a lawyer, 
dear." She pulled a card from 
her vest pocket. "If this uniformed Neanderthal persists in 
annoying you, I'll be delighted 
to handle him." 

The man in kilts said, "Gracel 
Please!" 

She shook him off. "Quiet, 
Norman. This is our business." 
She went on to the policeman, 
"Well? Call the wagon. In the 
meantime, my client will answer 
no questions." 

T*he official looked unhappy 
enough to cry and his face was 
getting dangerously red. Breen 
quietly stepped forward and 
slipped his raincoat around the 
shoulders of the girl. 

She looked startled and spoke 
for the first time. "Uh — thanks." 
She pulled the coat about her, 
cape fashion. 

The female attorney glanced at 
Breen then back to the cop. 


"Well, officer? Ready to arerst 
us?" 

He shoved his face close to 
hers. "I ain't going to give you 
the satisfaction!" He sighed and 
added, "Thanks, Mr, Breen. You 
know this lady?" 

"I'll take care of her. You can 
forget it, Kawonski." 

"I sure hope so. If she's with 
you, r*D do just that. But get 
her out of here, Mr. Breen — 
please!" 

The lawyer interrupted. "Just 
a moment. You're interfering 
with my client." 

Kawonski said, "Shut up, you! 
You heard Mr. Breen — she's 
with him. Right, Mr. Breen?" 

"Well — yes. I'm a friend. I'll 
take care of her." 

The transvestite said suspiciously, "I didn't hear her say 
that." 

Her companion said, "Gracel 
There's our bus." 

"And I didn't hear her say she 
was your client," the cop retorted. "You look like a — " his 
words were drowned out by the 
bus brakes — "and besides that, 
if you don't climb on that bus 
and get off my territory, I'll . . . 

-You'll what?" 

"Grace! We'll miss our bus.
"Just a moment, Norman. 
Dear, is this man really a friend 
of yours? Are you with him?" 
The girl looked uncertainly at 
Breen, then said in a low voice, 
"Uh, yes. He is. I am." 

"Well ..." The lawyer's companion pulled at her arm. She 
shoved her card into Breen's hand 
and got on the bus. It pulled 
away. 

Breen pocketed the card. 

KAWONSKI wiped his forehead. "Why did you do it. 
lady?" he said peevishly. 

The girl looked puzzled. "I — 
I don't know." 

"You hear that, Mr, Breen? 
That's what they all say. And if 
you pull 'em in, there's six more 
the next day. The Chief said — " 
He sighed. "The Chief said — 
well, if I had arrested her like 
that female shyster wanted me 
to, I'd be out at a Hundred 
and Ninety-sixth and Ploughed 
Ground tomorrow morning, 
thinking about retirement. So get 
her out of here, will you?" 
The girl said, "But — " 
"No 'buts' lady. Just be glad 
a real gentleman like Mr. Breen 
is willing to help you." He gathered up her clothes, handed them 
to her. When she reached for 
them, she again exposed an uncustomary amount of skin. Kawonski hastily gave the cloth ing to Breen instead, who 
crowded them into his coat 
pockets. 

She let Breen lead her to where 
his car was parked, got in and 
tucked the raincoat around her 
so that she was rather more 
dressed than a girl usually is. 
She looked at him. 

She saw a medium-sized and 
undistinguished man who was 
slipping down the wrong side of 
thirty-five and looked older. His 
eyes had that mild and slightly 
naked look of the habitual spectacles-wearer who is not at the 
moment with glasses. His hair 
was gray at the temples and 
thin on top. His herringbone suit, 
black shoes, white shirt, and neat 
tie smacked more of the East 
than of California. 

He saw a face which he classified as "pretty" and "wholesome" rather than "beautiful" 
and "glamorous." It was topped 
by a healthy mop of light brown 
hair. He set her age at twenty-five, 
give or take eighteen months. He 
smiled gently, climbed in without 
speaking and started his car. 

He turned up Doheny Drive 
and east on Sunset. Near La Cienega, he slowed down. "Feeling 
better?'* 

"Uh, I guess so Mr. — Breen?" 

"Call me Potiphar. What's 
your name? Don't tell me if you 
don't want to." 

"Me? I'm — I'm Meade Barstow." 

"Thank you, Meade. Where do 
you want to go? Home?" 

"I suppose so. Oh. my, no. I 
can't go home like this." She 
clutched the coat tightly to her. 

"Parents?" 

"No. My landlady. She'd be 
shocked to death.""
"Where, then?" 

She thought. "Maybe we could 
stop at a filling station and I 
could sneak into the ladies' 
room." 

"Maybe. See here, Meade — 
my house is six blocks from here 
and has a garage entrance. You 
could get inside without being 
seen." 

She stared. "You don't look 
like a wolf!" 

"Oh, but I am! The worst 
sort." He whistled and gnashed 
his teeth. "See? But Wednesday 
is my day off." 

She looked at him and dimpled. 
"Oh, well! I'd rather wrestle with 
you than with Mrs. Megeath. 
Let's go." 

They turned up into the hills. 

His bachelor diggings were 
one of the many little frame 
houses clinging like fungus to the 
brown slopes of the Santa Monica 
Mountains. The garage was 
notched into this hill; the house 
sat on it. 

He drove in. cut the ignition, 
and led her up a teetery inside 
stairway into the living room. 

"In there," he said, pointing. 
"Help yourself." He pulled her 
clothes out of his coat pockets 
and handed them to her. 

She blushed and took them, 
disappeared into his bedroom. He 
heard her turn the key in the 
lock. He settled down in his easy 
chair, took out his notebook, and 
started with the Herald-Express. 

He was finishing the Daily 
News and had added several 
notes to his collection when she 
came out. Her hair was neatly 
rolled; her face was restored; she 
had brushed most of the wrinkles 
out of her skirt. Her sweater was 
neither too tight nor deep cut, 
but it was pleasantly filled. She 
reminded him of well water and 
farm breakfasts. 

He took his raincoat from her, 
hung it up, and said, "Sit down, 
Meade." 

She said uncertainly, "I had 
better go." 

"If you must, but I had hoped 
to talk with you." 

"Well — " She sat down on the 
edge of his couch * and looked 
around. The room was small, 
but as neat as his necktie and as 
clean as his collar. The fireplace 
was swept; the floor was bare and 
polished. Books crowded bookshelves in every possible space. 
One corner was filled by an 
elderly flat-top desk; the papers 
on it were neatly in order. Near 
it, en its own stand, was a small 
electric calculator. To her right, 
french windows gave out on a 
tiny porch over the garage. Beyond it she could see the sprawling city, where a few neon signs 
were already blinking. 

She sat back a little. "This is 
a nice room — Potiphar. It looks 
like you." 

"I take that as a compliment. 
Thank you." She did not answer; 
he went on, "Would you like a 
drink?" 

"Oh, would I!" She shivered. "I 
guess I've got the jitters." 

He stood up. "Not surprising. 
What'll it be?" 

She took Scotch and water, no 
ice; he was a Bourbon -and -gin gerale man. She soaked up half 
her highball in silence, then put 
it down, squared her shoulders 
and said, "Potiphar?" 

"Yes, Meade?" 

"Look, if you brought me here 
to make a pass, I wish you'd go 
ahead and make it. It won't do 
you a bit of good, but it makes 
me nervous to wait." 

He said nothing and did not 
change his expression. 

She went on uneasily, "Not 
that I'd blame you for trying — 
under the circumstances. And I 
am grateful. But . . . well, it's 
just that I don't — "" 

He came over and took both 
her hands. "I haven't the slightest 
thought of making a pass at you. 
Nor need you feel grateful. I 
butted in because I was interested 
in your case." 

"My case? Are you a doctor? 
A psychiatrist?" 

10 



He shook his head. "I'm a 
mathematician. A statistician, to 
be precise." 

"Huh? I don't get it." 

"Don't worry about it. But I 
would like to ask some questions. 
May I?" 

"Oh, sure! Of course! I owe 
you that much — and then 
some." 

"You owe me nothing. Want 
your drink sweetened?" 

She gulped the balance and 
handed him her glass, then followed him out into the kitchen. 
He did an exact job of measuring 
and gave it back. 

"Now tell me why you took 
your clothes off," he said. 

C?HE frowned. "I don't know. 
I don't know. I don't know. 
I guess I just went crazy." She 
added, round-eyed, "But I don't 
feel crazy. Could I go off my 
rocker and not know it?" 

"You're not crazy . . . not more 
so than the rest of us," he 
amended. "Tell me, where did 
you see someone else do this?" 

"Huh? I never have." 

"Where did you read about it?" 

"But I haven't. Wait a minute 
— those people up in Canada. 
Dooka-somethings." 

"Doukhobors. That's all? No 
bareskin swimming patties? No 
strip poker?" 

She shook her head. "No. You 
may not believe it, but I was the 

A t A X Y SCIENCE fICTIOM 



lrind of a little girl who undressed 
under her nightie." She colored 
and added, "I still do — unless 
I remember to tell myself it's 
•illy." 

"I believe it. No news stories?" 

"No. Yes, there was ! About 
two weeks ago, I think it was. 
Some girl in a theater — in the 
audience, I mean. But I thought 
it was just publicity. You know 
the stunts they pull here." 

He shook his head. "It wasn't. 
February 3rd, the Grand Theater, 
Mrs. Alvin Copley. Charges dismissed." 

"How did you know?" 

"Excuse me." He went to his 
desk, dialed the City News Bureau. "Alf? This is Pot Breen. 
They still sitting on that story? 
. . . Yes, the Gypsy Rose file. 
Any new ones today?" 

He waited. Meade thought that 
she could make out swearing. 

"Take it easy, Alf — this hot 
weather can't last forever. Nine, 
eh? Well, add another — Santa 
Monica Boulevard, late this afternoon. No arrest." He added, 
"Nope, nobody got her , name. 
A middle-aged woman with a 
cast in one eye. I happened to 
see it . . . who, me? Why would 
I want to get mixed up? But it's 
rounding into a very, very interesting picture." > 

He put the phone down. 

Meade said, "Cast in one eye, 
indeed!" 



"Shall I call him back and give 
him your name?" 
"Oh, nor 

"Very well. Now, Meade, we 
seemed to have located the point 
of contagion in your case — Mrs. 
Copley. What I'd like to know 
next is how you felt, what you 
were thinking about, when you 
did it." 

She was frowning intently. 
"Wait a minute, Potiphar. Do I 
understand that nine other girls 
have pulled the stunt I pulled?" 

"Oh, no. Nine others today. 
You are — " he paused briefly — 
"the three hundred and nineteenth case in Los Angeles 
County since the first of the year. 
I don't have figures on the rest 
of the country, but the suggestion 
to clamp down on the stories 
came from the eastern news services when the papers here put 
our first cases on the wire. That 
proves that it's a problem elsewhere, too." 

"You mean that women all 
over the country are peeling off 
their clothes in public? Why, how 
shocking!" 

TIE said nothing. She blushed 

again and insisted, "Well, 
it is shocking, even if it was me, 
this time." 

"No. Meade. One case is shocking; over three hundred makes it 
scientifically interesting. That's 
why I want to know how it felt.

Tell me about it.** 

"But — all right, I'll try. I 
told you I don't know why I did 
it: I still don't. I — " 

"You remember it?" 

"Oh, yes! I remember getting 
up off the bench and pulling up 
my sweater. I remember unzipping my skirt. I remember thinking I would have to hurry because 
I could see my bus stopped two 
blocks down the street. I remember how good it felt when I finally 
— " She paused and looked 
puzzled. "But I still don't know 
why." 

"What were you thinking about 
just before you stood up?" 

M I don't remember." 

"Visualize the street. What was 
passing by? Where were your 
hands? Were your legs crossed or 
uncrossed? Was there anybody 
near you? What were you thinking about?" 

"Nobody was on the bench 
with me. I had my hands in my 
lap. Those characters in the 
mixed-up clothes were standing 
nearby, but I wasn't paying attention. I wasn't thinking much 
except that my feet hurt and I 
wanted to get home — and how 
unbearably hot and sultry the 
weather was. Then — " her eyes 
became distant — "suddenly I 
knew what I had to do and it 
was very urgent that I do it. So 
I stood up and I — and I — " 
Her voice became shrill. 



"Take it easy!" he said sharply. 
"Don't do it again." 

"Huh? Why, Mr. Breed! t 
wouldn't do anything like that." 

"Of course not. Then what happened after you undressed?" 

"Why, you put your raincoat 
around me and you know the 
rest." She faced him. "Say Potiphar, what were you doing with 
a raincoat? It hasn't rained in 
weeks. This is the driest, hottest 
rainy season in years." 

"In sixty-eight years, to be 
exact." 

"Sixty — " 

"I carry a raincoat anyhow. 
Just a notion of mine, but I feel 
that when it does rain, it's going 
to rain awfully hard." He added, 
"Forty days and forty nights,, 
maybe." 

She decided that he was being 
humorous and laughed. 

He went on, "Can you remember how you got the idea of undressing?" 

She swirled her glass and 
thought. "I simply don't know." 

He nodded. "That's what I expected." 

"I don't understand — unlesi 
you think I'm crazy. Do you?" 

"No. I think you had to do it 
and could not help it and don't 
know why and can't know why."* 

"But you know." She said it 
accusingly. 

"Maybe. At least I have some 
figures. Ever take any interest m

statistics, Meade?** 

She shook her head. "Figurei 
confuse me. Never mind statistics 
— / want to know why I did 
what I did.'" 

He looked at her very soberly. 
**I th^nk we're lemmings. Meade.** 

QHE looked puzzled, then horrifled. "You mean those little 
furry mouselike creatures? The 
ones that — " 

"Yes. The ones that periodically make a death migration, untill millions, hundreds of millions 
of them drown themselves in the 
sea. Ask a lemming why he does 
it. If you could get him to slow 
up his rush toward death, even 
money says he would rationalize 
his answer as well as any college 
graduate. But he does it because 
he has to — and so do we." 

"That's a horrid idea, Potiphar." 

"Maybe. Come here. Meade. 
I'll show you figures that confuse 
me, too.*' He went to his desk 
and opened a drawer, took out a 
packet of cards. "Here's one. Two 
weeks ago, a man sues 'an entire 
state legislature for alienation of 
his wife's affection — and the 
judge lets the suit be tried. Or 
this one — a patent application 
for a device to lay the globe over 
on its side and warm up the arctic 
regions. Patent denied, but the inventor took in over three hundred 
thousand dollars in down pay


ments on North Pole real estate 
before the postal authorities 
stepped in. Now he's fighting the 
case and it looks as if he might 
win. And here — prominent 
bishop proposes applied courses 
in the so-called facts of life in 
high schools." 

He put the card away hastily. 
"Here's a dilly — a bill introduced in the Alabama lower 
house to repeal the laws of atomic 
energy. Not the present statutes, 
but the natural laws concerning 
nuclear physics: the wording 
makes that plain." He shrugged. 
"How silly can you get?" 

"They're* crazy." 

"No, Meade. One like that 
might be crazy; a lot of thern 
becomes a lemming death march. 
No, don't object — I've plotted 
them on a curve. The last time 
we had anything like this was the 
so-called Era of Wonderful Nonsense. But this one is much 
worse." He delved into a lower 
drawer, hauled out a graph. "The 
amplitude is more than twice at 
great and we haven't reached 
peak. What the peak will be, I 
don't dare guess — three separate rhythms, reinforcing." 

She peered at the curves. "You 
mean that the lad with the arctic 
real estate deal is somewhere on 
this line?" 

"He adds to it. And back here 
on the last crest are the flagpole 
sitters and the goldfish awallow


TME Y I A ft OV IN I JACKPOT 



ers and the Ponzi hoax and the 
marathon dancers and the man 
who pushed a peanut up Pikes 
Peak with his nose. You're on the 
new crest — or you will be when 
I add you in." 

She made a face. "I don't like 
it " 

"Neither do I. But it's as clear 
as a bank statement. This year 
the human race is letting down 
its hair, flipping its lip. with a 
finger, and saying, 'Wubba, 
wubba, wubba.' " 

She shivered. "Do you suppose 
I could have another -drink? Then 
1*11 go.'* 

"I have a better idea. I owe 
you a dinner for answering questions. Pick a place and we'll have 
a cocktail before." 

She chewed her lip. "You don't 
owe me anything. And I don't 
feel up to facing a restaurant 
crowd. I might — I might — 

"No, you wouldn't," he said 
sharply. "It doesn't hit twice." 

"You're sure? Anyhow, I don't 
want to face a crowd." She 
glanced at his kitchen door. 
"Have you anything to eat in 
there? I can cook." 

"Urn, breakfast things. And 
there's a pound of ground top 
round in the freezer compartment 
and some rolls. I sometimes make 
hamburgers when I don't want to 
go out." 

She headed for the kitchen. 
"Drunk or sober, fully dressed or 



— or naked, I can cook. You'll 
see." 

TTE did see. Open-faced sand 
wiches with the meat married to toasted buns and the 
flavor garnished rather than suppressed by scraped Bermuda 
onion and thin-sliced dill, a 
salad made from things she had 
scrounged out of his refrigerator, 
potatoes crisp but not vulcanized. 
They ate it on the tiny balcony, 
sopping it down with cold beer. 

He sighed and wiped his mouth, 
"Yes, Meade, you can cook." 

"Some day I'll arrive with 
proper materials and pay you 
back. Then I'll prove it." 

"You've already proved it. 
Nevertheless, I accept. But I tell 
you three times — which makes it 
true, of course — that you owe 
me nothing." 

"No? If you hadn't been a Boy 
Scout, I'd be in jail." 

Breen shook his head. "The police have orders to keep it quiet 
at all costs — to keep it from 
growing. You saw that. And, my 
dear, you weren't a person to me 
at the time. I didn't even see your 
face." 

"You saw plenty else!" 

"Truthfully, I didn't look. You 
were just a — a statistic." 

She toyed with her knife and 
said puzzled, "I'm not sure, but 
I think I've just been insulted. In 
all the twenty-five years that I've

O A L AX Y SCIENCE FICTION 



fought men off. more or less successfully, I've been called a lot 
of names — but a 'statistic?* Why, 
I ought to take your slide rule 
and beat you to death with it." 

"My dear young lady — " 

"I'm not a lady, that's for sure. 
But I'm not a statistic, either." 

"My dear Meade, then. I 
wanted to tell you, before you 
did anything hasty, that in college I wrestled varsity middleweight." 

She grinned and dimpled. 
''That's more the talk a girl likes 
to hear. I was beginning to be 
afraid you had been assembled 
in an adding machine factory. 
Potty, you're really a dear." 

"If that is a diminutive of my 
given name, I like it. But if it refers to my waist line, I definitely 
resent it." 

She reached across and patted 
his stomach. "I like your waist 
line; lean and hungry men are 
difficult. If I were cooking for 
you regularly, I'd really pad it." 

"Is that a proposal?" 

"Let it lie, let it lie. Potty, do 
you really think the whole 
country is losing its buttons?" 

He sobered at once. "It's worse 
than that." 

"Huh?" 

"Come inside. I'll show you." 

HPHEY gathered up dishes and 
dumped them in the sink, 
Breen talking all the while. 



"As a kid. I was fascinated by 
numbers. Numbers are pretty 
things and they combine in such 
interesting configurations. I took 
my degree in math, of course, and 
got a job as a junior actuary with 
Midwestern Mutual — the insurance outfit. That was fun. No 
way on Earth to tell when a particular man is going to die. but 
an absolute certainty that so 
many men of a certain age group 
would die before a certain date. 
The curves were so lovely — and 
they always worked out. Always. 
You didn't have to know why; 
you could predict with dead certainty and never know why. The 
equations worked ; the curves 
were right. 

"I was interested in astronomy, 
too; it was the one science where 
individual figures worked out 
neatly, completely, and accurately, down to the last decimal 
point that the instruments were 
good for. Compared with astronomy, the other sciences were 
mere carpentry and kitchen 
chemistry. 

"I found there were nooks and 
crannies in astronomy where individual numbers won't do, where 
you have to go over to statistics,, 
and I became even more interested. I joined the Variable Star 
Association and I might have 
gone into astronomy professionally, instead of what I'm in now 
— business consultation — if I 



THE YEAR OP THE JACKPOT 



IS 



hadnt gotten interested in something else." 

" "Business consultation?' " repeated Meade. "Income tax 
work?" 

"Oh, no. That's too elementary. 
I'm the numbers boy for a firm 
of industrial engineers. I can tell 
a rancher exactly how many of 
his Hereford bull calves will be 
sterile. Or I can tell a motion 
picture producer how much rain 
insurance to carry on location. Or 
maybe how big a company in a 
particular line must be to carry 
its own risk in industrial accidents. And I'm right. I'm always 
right." 

"Wait a minute. Seems to me 
a big company would have to 
have insurance." 

"Contrariwise. A really big corporation begins to resemble a 
statistical universe." 

"Huh?" 

"Never mind. I got interested in 
something else — cycles. Cycles 
are everything, Meade. And everywhere. The tides. The seasons. 
Wars. Love. Everybody knows 
that in the spring the young 
man's fancy lightly turns to what 
the girls never stopped thinking 
about, but did you know that it 
runs in an eighteen-year-plus 
cycle as well? And that a girl 
born at the wrong swing of the 
curve doesn't stand nearly as 
good a chance as her older or 
younger sister?" 



"Is thai why I'm still a doddering old maid?" 

"You're twenty-five?" He pondered. "Maybe, but your chances 
are improving again; the curve is 
swinging up. Anyhow, remember 
you are just one statistic; the 
curve applies to the group. Some 
girls get married every year." 

"Don't call me a statistic," she 
repeated firmly. 

"Sorry. And marriages match 
up with acreage planted to wheat, 
with wheat cresting ahead. You 
could almost say that planting 
wheat makes people gtt married." 

"Sounds silly." 

"It is silly. The whole notion 
of cause-and-effect is probably 
superstition. But the same cycle 
shows a peak in house building 
right after a peak in marriages." 

"Now that makes sense." 

"Does it? How many newlyweds do you know who can afford 
to build a house? You might as 
well blame it on wheat acreage. 
We don't know why; it just is." 

"Sun spots, maybe?" 

"You can correlate Sun spots 
with stock prices, or Columbia 
River salmon, or woman's skirts. 
And you are just as much justified in blaming short skirts for 
Sun spots as you are in blaming 
Sun spots for salmon. We don't 
know. But the curves go on just 
the same." 

"But there has to be some reason behind it.'"

"Does there? That's mere assumption. A fact has no 'why.' 
There it stands, self-demonstrating. Why did you take your 
clothes off today?" 

She frowned. "That's not fair." 

"Maybe not. But I want to 
show you why I'm worried." 

"IJE went into the bedroom, 
came out with a large roll 
of tracing paper. 

"We'll spread it on the floor. 
Here they are. all of them. The 
54-year cycle — see the Civil 
War there? See how it matches 
in? The eighteen and one-thirdyear cycle, the 9-plus cycle, the 
41 -month shorty, the 'th*ree 
rhythms of Sun spots — everything, all combined in one grand 
chart. Mississippi River floods, 
fur catches in Canada, stock 
market prices, marriages, epidemics, freight-car loadings, bank 
clearings, locust plagues, divorces, 
tree growth, wars, rainfall, Earth 
magnetism, building construction, 
patents applied for. murders — 
you name it; I've got it there." 

She stared at the bewildering 
array of wavy lines. "But, Potty, 
what does it mean?" 

"It means that these things all 
happen, in regular rhythm, 
whether we like it or not. It means 
that when skirts are due to go up, 
all the stylists in Paris can't make 
'em go down. It means that when 
prices are going down, all the 



controls and supports and government planning can't make 'em 
go up." He pointed to a curve. 
"Take a look at the grocery ads. 
Then turn to the financial page 
and read how the Big Brains try 
to double-talk their way out of it. 
It means that when an epidemic 
is due, it happens, despite all the 
public health efforts. It means 
we're lemmings." 

She pulled her lip. "I don't like 
it. 'I am the master of my fate.' 
and so forth. I've got free will. 
Potty. I know I have — I can 
feel it." 

"I imagine every little neutron 
in an atom bomb feels the same 
way. He can go spung! or he can 
sit still, just as he pleases. But 
statistical mechanics work out all 
the same and the bomb goes off 

— which is what I'm leading up 
to. See anything odd there, 
Meade?" 

She studied the chart, trying 
not to let the curving lines confuse her. 

"They sort of bunch up over 
at the right end." 

"You're dern tootin' they do! 
See that dotted vertical line? 
That's right now — ■ and things 
are bad enough. But take a look 
at that solid vertical; that's about

a crest exactly on — or almost on 
— that line." 
"That's bad?" 

"What do you think? Three of 
the big ones troughed back in 
1929 and the depression almost 
ruined us . . . even with the big 
54-year cycle supporting things. 
Now we've got the big one

are not things that help. I mean 
to say, tent caterpillars and influenza don't do us any good. 
Meade, if statistics mean anything, this tired old planet hasn't 
seen a trend like this since Eve 
went into the apple business. I'm

She searched his face. "Potty, 
you're not simply having fun with 
me? You know I can't check up 
on you." 

"I wish to heaven I were. No,

THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT 



MARRIAGE SOLEMNIZED ON 
FLOOR OF HUDSON 

New York, 13 July — In a specially constructed diving suit 
built for two, Merydith Smithe, 
cafe society headline girl, and 
Prince Augie Schleswieg of New 
York and the Riviera were united 
today by Bishop Dalton in a 
service televised with the aid of 
the Navy's ultra-new — ■ 

AS the Year of the Jackpot progressed, Breen took melancholy pleasure in adding to the 
data which proved that the curve 
was sagging as predicted. The 
undeclared World War continued 
its bloody, blundering way at 
half a dozen spots around a tortured globe. Breen did not chart 
it; the headlines were there for 
anyone to read. He concentrated 
on the odd facts in the other 
pages of the papers, facts which, 
taken singly, meant nothing, but 
taken together showed a disastrous trend. 

He listed stock market prices, 
rainfall, wheat futures, but the 
"silly season" items were what 
fascinated him. To be sure, some 
humans were always doing silly 
things — but at what point had 
prime damfoolishness become 
commonplace? When, for example, had the zombie-like professional models become accepted 
ideals of American womanhood? 
What were the gradations be


tween National Cancer Week and 
National Athlete's Foot Week? 
On what day had the American 
people finally taken leave of horse 
sense? 

Take transvestism. Male-andfemale dress customs were arbitrary, but they had seemed to be 
deeply rooted in the culture. 
When did the breakdown start? 
With Marlene Dietrich's tailored 
suits? By the late nineteen-forties, 
there was no "male" article of 
clothing that a woman could not 
wear in public — but when had 
men started to slip over the line? 
Should he count the psychological cripples who had made the 
word "drag" a by-word in Greenwich Village and Hollywood long 
before this outbreak? Or were 
they "wild shots" not belonging 
on the curve? Did it start with 
some unknown normal man attending a masquerade and there 
discovering that skirts actually 
were more comfortable and practical than trousers? Or had it 
started with the resurgence of 
Scottish nationalism reflected in 
the wearing of kilts by many 
Scottish- Americans? 

Ask a lemming to state his motives! The outcome was in front 
of him, a news story. Transvestism by draft dodgers had at 
last resulted in a mass arrest in 
Chicago which was to have ended 
in a giant joint trial — only to 
have the deputy prosecutor show

up in a pinafore and defy the 
judge to submit to an examination to determine the judge's true 
■ex. The judge suffered a stroke 
and died and the trial was postponed — postponed forever, in 
Breen's opinion; he doubted that 
this particular blue law would 
ever again be enforced. 

Or the laws about indecent exposure, for that matter. The attempt to limit the Gypsy Rose 
syndrome by ignoring it had 
taken the starch out of enforcement. Now here was a report 
about the AH Souls Community 
Church of Springfield; the pastor 
had reinstituted ceremonial nudity. Probably the first time this 
thousand years. Breen thought, 
aside from some screwball cults 
in Los Angeles. The reverend 
gentleman claimed that the ceremony was identical with the 
"dance of the high priestess" in 
the ancient temple of Karnak. 

Could be, but Breen had private information that the "priestess" had been working the bur* 
lesque and nightclub circuit 
before her present engagement. 
In any case, the holy leader was 
packing them in and had not 
been arrested. 

Two weeks later a hundred and 
nine churches in thirty -three 
states offered equivalent attractions. Breen entered them on his 
curves. 

This queasy oddity seemed to 
THE YEAR OF THE JACKP 



him to have no relation to the 
startling rise in the dissident 
evangelical cults throughout the 
country. These churches were sincere, earnest and poor — but growing, ever since the War. Now they 
were multiplying like yeast. 

It seemed a statistical cinch 
that the United States was about 
to become godstruck again. He 
correlated it with Transcendentalism and the trek of the Latter 
Day Saints. Hmm. yes, it fitted. 
And the curve was pushing to 
ward a crest. 

TRILLIONS in war bonds were 

now falling due ; wartime 
marriages were reflected in the 
swollen peak of the Los Angeles 
school population. The Colorado 
River was at a record low and 
the towers in Lake Mead stood 
high out of the water. But the 
Angclenos committed communal 
suicide by watering lawns as 
usual. The Metropolitan Water 
District commissioners tried to 
stop it. It fell between the stools 
of the police powers of fifty "sovereign" cities. The taps remained 
open, trickling away the life 
blood of the desert paradise. 

The four regular party conventions — Dixiecrats, Regular Republicans, the Regular Regular 
Republicans, and the Democrats 
— attracted scant attention, because ' the Know-Nothings had 
not yet met. The fact that the 

OT 11 



"American Rally," as the KnowNothings preferred to be called, 
claimed not to be a party but 
an educational society did not 
detract from their strength. But 
what was their strength? Their 
beginnings had been So obscure 
that Breen had had to go back 
and dig into the December 1951 
files, yet he had been approached 
twice this very week to join them, 
right inside his own office — once 
by his boss, once by the janitor. 

He hadn't been able to chart 
the Know-Nothings. They gave 
him chills in his spine. He kept 
column-inches on them, found 
that their publicity was shrinking 
while their numbers were obviously zooming. 

Krakatoa blew up on July 18th. 
It provided the first important 
transpacific TV-cast. Its effect 
on sunsets, on solar constant, on 
mean temperature, and on rainfall would not be felt until later 
in the year. 

The San Andreas fault, its 
stresses unrelieved since the Long 
Beach disaster of 1933, continued 
to build up imbalance — an unhealed wound running the full 
length of the West Coast. 

Pelee and Etna erupted. Mauna 
Loa was still quiet. 

Flying Saucers seemed to be 
landing daily in every state. Nobody had exhibited one on the 
ground — or had the Department 
of Defense sat on them? Breen 



was unsatisfied with the off-therecord reports he had been able 
to get; the alcoholic content of 
some of them had been high. But 
the sea serpent on Ventura Beach 
was real; he had seen it. The 
troglodyte in Tennessee he was 
not in a position to verify. 

Thirty-one domestic air crashes 
the last week in July . . . was it 
sabotage, or was it a sagging 
curve on a chart? And that neopolio epidemic that skipped from 
Seattle to New York? Time for a 
big epidemic? Breen's chart said 
it was. But how about bacteriological warfare? Could a chart 
know that a Slav biochemist 
would perfect an efficient virusand-vector at the right time? 

Nonsense! 

But the curves, if they meant 
anything at all. included "free 
will"; they averaged in all the 
individual "wills" of a statistical 
universe — and came out as a 
smooth function. Every morning, 
three million "free wills" flowed 
toward the center of the New 
York megapolis; every evening, 
they flowed out again — all by 
"free will" and on a smooth and 
predictable curve. 

Ask a lemming! Ask all the 
lemmings, dead and alive. Let 
them take a vote on it! 

¥> REEN tossed his notebook 
aside and phoned Meade. 
"Is this my favorite statistic?**

"Potty i I was thinking about 
you." 

"Naturally. This is your night 
off." 

"Yes, but another reason, too. 
Potiphar, have you ever taken 
a look at the Great Pyramid?" 

"I haven't even been to Niagara 
Falls. I'm looking for a rich 
woman, so I can travel." 

"I'll let you know when I get 
my first million, but — " 

"That's the first time you've 
proposed to me this week." 

"Shut up. Have you ever 
looked into the prophecies they 
found inside the pyramid?" 

"Look, Meade, that's in the 
same - class with astrology — 
strictly for the squirrels. Grow 
up." 

"Yes, of course. But, Potty, I 
thought you were interested in 
anything odd. This is odd." 

"Oh. Sorry. If it's 'silly season" stuff, let's see it." 

"All right. Am I cooking for 
you tonight?" 

"It's Wednesday, isn't it?" 

"How soon will you get here?" 

He glanced at his watch. "Pick 
you up in eleven minutes." He 
felt his whiskers. "No, twelve and 
a half." 

"I'll be ready. Mrs. Megeath 
says these regular dates mean 
that you are going to marry me." 

"Pay no attention to her. She's 
just a statistic and I'm a wild 
datum," 



*'Oh well, I've got two hundred 
and forty-seven dollars toward 
that million. 'By!" 

Meade's prize to show him was 
the usual Rosicrucian comeon, 
elaborately printed, and including a photograph (retouched, he 
was sure) of the much disputed 
line on the corridor wall which 
was alleged to prophesy, by its 
various discontinuities, the entire 
future. This one had an unusual 
time scale, but the major events 
were all marked on it — the fall 
of Rome, the Norman Invasion, 
the Discovery of America, Napoleon, the World Wars. 

What made it interesting was 
that it suddenly stopped — in 1952. 

"What about it, Potty?" 

"I guess the stonecutter got 
tired. Or got fired. Or they hired 
a new head priest with new 
ideas." He tucked it into his desk. 
"Thanks. I'll think about how to 
list it " 

But he got it out again, applied 
dividers and a magnifying glass. 

"It says here," he announced, 
"that the end comes late in August — unless that's a fly speck." 

"Morning or afternoon? I have 
to know how to dress." 

"Shoes will be worn. All God's 
chilluns got shoes." He put it 
away. 

She was silent for a moment, 
then said, "Potty, isn't it about 
time to jump?" 

"Huh? Girl, don't let that thing

edffect you! That's 'silly season* 
stuff." 

"Yes. But take a look at your 
chart." 

Nevertheless, he took the next 
afternoon Dff, spent it in the reference room of the main library, 
confirmed his opinion of soothsayers. Nostradamus was pretentiously silly, Mother Shippey was 
worse. In any of them you could 
find whatever you looked for.. 

He did find one item in Nostradamus that he liked: "The Oriental shall come forth from his 
seat ... he shall pass through 
the sky, through the waters and 
the snow, and he shall strike each 
one with his weapon." 

That sounded like what the 
Department of Defense expected 
the commies to try to do to the 
Western Allies. 

But it was also a description 
of every invasion that had come 
out of the "heartland" in the 
memory of mankind. 

Nuts! 

When he got home, he found 
himself taking down his father's 
Bible and turning to Revelations. 
He could not find anything he 
Could understand, but he got fascinated by the recurriag use of 
precise numbers. Presently he 
thumbed through the Book. 

His eye lit on: "Boast not thyself of tomorrow; for thou knowest not what a day may bring 
forth." 



He put the Book away, feeling 
humbled, but not cheered. 

HpHE rains started the next 
morning. 

The Master Plumbers elected 
Miss Star Morning "Miss Sanitary Engineering of 1952" on the 
same day that the morticians 
designated her as "The Body I 
Would Like Best to Prepare," and 
her option was dropped by Fragrant Features. 

Congress voted $1.37 to compensate Thomas Jefferson Meeks 
for losses incurred while an 
emergency postman for the 
Christmas rush of 1936, approved 
the appointment of five lieutenant 
generals and one ambassador and 
adjourned in less than eight minutes. 

The fire extinguishers in a midwest orphanage turned out to be 
filled with nothing but air. 

The chancellor of the leading 
football institution sponsored a 
fund to send peace messages and 
vitamins to the Politburo. 

The stock market slumped 
nineteen points and the tickers 
ran two hours late. 

Wichita, Kansas, remained 
flooded while Phoenix, Arizona, 
cut off drinking water to areas 
outside city limits. 

And Poptiphar Breen found 
that he had left his raincoat at 
Meade Barstow's Rooming house. 

He phoned her landlady, but 



0AIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Mrs. Megeath turned him over to 
Meade. 

"What are you doing home on 
a Friday?" he demanded. 

"The theater manager laid me 
off. Now you'll have to marry 
me." 

"You can't afford me. Meade 
—seriously, baby, what happened?" 

"I was ready to leave the dump 
anyway. For the last six weeks 
the popcorn machine has been 
carrying the place. Today I sat 
through The Lana Turner Story 
twice. Nothing to do." 

"I'll be along." 

"Eleven minutes?" 

"It's raining. Twenty — - with 
luck." 

It was more nearly sixty. Santa 
Monica Boulevard was a navigable stream; Sunset Boulevard 
was a subway jam. When he tried 
to ford the streams leading to 
Mrs, Megeath's house, he found 
that changing tires with the wheel 
wedged against a storm drain presented problems. 

"Potty!" she exclaimed when 
he squished in. "You look like a 
drowned rat." 

He found himself suddenly 
wrapped in a blanket robe belonging to the late Mr. Megeath 
and sipping hot cocoa while Mrs. 
Megeath dried his clothing in the 
kitchen. 

"Meade, I'm 'at liberty' too." 
"Huh? You quit your job?" 



"Not exactly. Old Man Wiley 
and I have been having differences of opinion about my answers for months — too much 
'Jackpot factor' in the figures 1 
give him to turn over to clients. 
Not that I call it that, but he her 
felt th at I was unduly pessi mistic." 

"But you were right!" 

■"Since when has being right endeared a man to his boss? But 
that wasn't why he fired me; ii 
was just the excuse. He wants r. 
man willing to back up the 
Know-Nothing program with scientific double-talk and I wouldn't 
join." He went to the window. 
"It's raining harder." 

"But the Know-Nothings 
haven't got any program." 

"I know that." 

"Potty, you should have joined. 
It doesn't mean anything. I joined 
three months ago." 

"The hell you did!" 

She shrugged. "You pay your 
dollar and you turn up for two 
meetings and they leave you 
alone. It kept my job for another 
three months. What of it?" 

"Well, I'm sorry you did it: 
that's all. Forget it. Meade, the 
water is over the curbs out there." 

"You had better stay here overnight." 

"Mmm ... I don't like to leave 
Entropy parked out in this stuff 
all night. Meade?" 

"Yes, Potty?"

"We're both out of jobs. How 
would you like to duck north into 
the Mojave and find a dry spot?" 

"I'd love it. But look, Potty, is 
this a proposal or just a proposition?" 

"Don't pull that 'either-or* 
stuff on me. It's just a suggestion 
for a vacation. Do you want to 
take a chaperone?" 

"No." 

"Then pack a bag." 

"Right away. But pack a bag 
how? Are you trying to tell me 
it's time to jump?" 

He faced her, then looked back 
at the window. 

"I don't know," he said slowly, 
"but this rain might go on quite 
a while. Don't take anything you 
don't have to have — but don't 
leave anything behind you can't 
get along without." 
. He repossessed his clothing 
from Mrs. Megeath while Meade 
was upstairs. She came down 
dressed in slacks and carrying 
two large bags ; under one arm was 
a battered and rakish teddy bear. 

"This is Winnie," she said. 

"Winnie the Pooh?" 

"No, Winnie Churchill. When 
I feel bad, he promises me blood, 
sweat, and tears; then I feel better. You did say to bring anything I couldn't do without, didn't 
you?" She looked at him anxiously. 

"Right." 

He took the bags. Mrs. Me


geath had seemed satisfied with 
his explanation that they were 
going to visit his (mythical) 
aunt in Bakersfield before looking 
for jobs. Nevertheless, she embarrassed him by kissing him 
good-by and telling him to "take 
care of my little girl." 

SANTA Monica Boulevard was 
blocked off from use. While 
stalled in traffic in Beverly Hills, 
he fiddled with the car radio, getting squawks and crackling noises, 
then finally one station nearby: 
" — in effect," a harsh, high, staccato voice was saying, "the Kremlin has given us till sundown to 
get out of town. This is your New 
York reporter, who thinks that 
in days like these every American 
must personally keep his powder 
dry. And now for a word from — " 
Breen switched it off and 
glanced at her face. "Don't 
worry," he said. "They've been 
talking that way for years." 
"You think they are bluffing?" 
"I didn't say that. I said, 'Don't 
worry,' " 

But his own packing, with her 
help, was clearly on a "survival 
kit" basis — canned goods, all his 
warm clothing, a sporting rifle he 
had not fired in over two years, a 
first-aid kit and the contents of 
his medicine chest. He dumped 
the stuff from his desk into a 
carton, shoved it into the back 
seat along with cans and books 



a* 




 



and coats, and covered the 
plunder with all the blankets in 
the house. They went back up 
the rickety stairs for a last check. 

"Potty, where's your chart?** 

"Rolled up on the back seat 
shelf. I guess that's all — hey, wait 
a minute!" He went to a shelf 
over his desk and began taking 
down small, sober-looking magazines. "I dern near left behind my 
file of The Western Astronomer 
and the Proceedings of the Variable Star Association" 

"Why take them?" 

"I must be nearly a year behind on both of them. Now maybe 
I'll have time to read." 

"Hmm . . . Potty, watching you 
read professional journals is not 
my notion of a vacation." 

"Quiet, woman! You took Winnie; I take these." 

She shut up and helped him. 
He cast a longing eye at his 
electric calculator, but decided it 
was too much like the White 
Knight's mousetrap. He could get 
by with his slide rule. 

As the car splashed out into 
the street, she said, "Potty, how 
•re you fixed for cash?" 

"Huh? Okay, I guess.*' 

"I mean, leaving while the 
banks arc closed and everything." 
She held up her purse. "Here's my 
bank. It isn't much, but we can 
use it." 

He smiled and patted her knee. 
"Good gal! I'm sitting on my 

THE YEAR OF THE JACKP 



bank; I started turning everything to cash about the first of 
the year." 

"Oh. I closed out my bank account right after we met." 

"You did? You must have taken 
my maunderings setiously." 

"I always take you seriously.** 

TV! INT Canyon was a five-milean-hour nightmare, with 
visibility limited to the tail lights 
of the truck ahead. When they 
stopped for coffee at Halfway, 
they confirmed what seemed evident: Cajon Pass was closed and 
long-haul traffic for Route 66 
was being detoured through th« 
secondary pass. 

At long, long last they reached 
the Victorville cutoff and lost 
some of the traffic — a good thing, 
because the windshield wiper on 
his side had quit working and 
they were driving by the committee system. 

Just short of Lancaster, she 
said suddenly. "Potty, is this 
buggy equipped with a snorkel?" 

"Nope." 

"Then we had better stop. I 
see a light off the road.*' 

The light was an auto court. 
Meade settled the matter of 
economy versus convention by 
signing the book herself: they 
were placed in one cabin. He saw 
that it had twin beds and let 
the matter ride. Meade went to 
bed with her teddy bear without

night. It was already gray, wet 
dawn. 

They got up in the late afternoon and decided to stay over one 
more night, then push north toward Bakersfield. A high pressure area was alleged to be moving south, crowding the warm, 
wet mass that smothered Southern California. They wanted to 
get into it. Breen had the wiper 
repaired and bought two new 
tires to replace his ruined spare, 
added some camping items to his 
cargo, and bought for Meade a 
.32 automatic, a lady's social purpose gun. 

"What's this for?" she wanted 
to know. 

"Well, you're carrying quite a 
bit of cash." 

"Oh. I thought maybe I was 
to use it to fight you off." 
"Now, Meade — " 
"Never mind. Thanks, Potty." 
They had finished supper and 
were packing the car with their 
afternoon's purchases when the 
quake struck. Five inches of rain 
in twenty-four hours, more than 
three billion tons of mass suddenly loaded on a fault already 
overstrained, all cut loose in 
one subsonic, stomach-twisting 
runtble. 

MflEADE sat down on the wet 
ground very suddenly; 
Biwn stayed upright by dancing 



like a log-roller. When the ground 
quieted down somewhat, thirty 
seconds later, he helped her up. 

"You all right?" 

"My slacks are soaked." She 
added pettishly, "But, Potty, it 
never quakes in wet weather. 
Never. You said so yourself." 

"Keep quiet, can't you?" He 
opened the car door and switched 
on the radio, waited impatiently 
for it to warm up. 

** — your Sunshine Station in 
Riverside, California. Keep tuned 
to this station for the latest developments. As of now it is impossible to tell ' the size of this 
disaster. The Colorado River 
aqueduct is broken: nothing is 
known of the extent of the damage nor how long it will take to 
repair it. So far as we know, the 
Owens River Valley aqueduct 
may be intact, but all persons in 
the Los Angeles area are advised 
to conserve water. My personal 
advice is to stick your washtubs 
out into this rain. 

"I now read from the standard 
disaster instructions, quote: 'Boil 
all water. Remain quietly in your 
homes and do not panic. Stay off 
the highway*. Cooperate with the 
police and render — ' Joe! Catch

der five feet of water. I repeat, 
this is unconfirmed. Here's a 
message from the commanding 
general, March Field: 'Official, 
all military personnel will report — ' " 

Breen switched it off. "Get in 
the car." 

He stopped in the town, managed to buy six five-gallon tins 
and a jeep tank. He filled thern 
with gasoline and packed them 
with blankets in the back seat, 
topping off the mess with a dozen 
cans of oil. Then they started 
rolling. 

"What are we doing, Potiphar?" 

"I want to get west of the valley highway." 

"Any particular place west?" 

"1 think so. We'll see. You work 
the radio, but keep an eye on 
the road, too. That gas back there 
makes me nervous." 

rpHROUGH the town of Mojave and northwest on 466 
into the Tehachapi Mountains — 

Reception was poor in the pass, 
but what Meade could pick up 
confirmed the first impression — 
worse than the quake of '06, worse 
than San Francisco, Managua, 
and Long Beach lumped together. 

When they got down out of 
the mountains, the weather was 
clearing locally; a few stars appeared. Breen swung left off the 
highway and ducked south of 



Bakersfield by the county road, 
reached the Route 99 super-highway just south of Greenfield. It 
was, as he had feared, already 
jammed with refugees. He was 
forced to go along with the flow 
for a couple of miles before he 
could cut west at Greenfield toward Taft. They stopped on the 
western outskirts of the town and 
ate at an all-night joint. 

They were about to climb back 
into the car when there was suddenly "sunrise" due south. The 
rosy light swelled almost instantaneously, filled the sky, and died. 
Where it had been, a red-andpurple pillar of cloud was spreading to a mushroom top. 

Breen stared at it. glanced at 
his watch, then said harshly, "Get 
in the car." 

"Potty! That was—" 

"That used to be Los Angeles. 
Get in the carl" 

He drove silently for several 
minutes. Meade seemed to be in 
a state of shock, unable to speak. 
When the sound reached them, 
he again glanced at his watch. 

"Six minutes and nineteen seconds. That's about right." 

"Potty, we should have brought 
Mrs. Megeath." 

"How was 1 to know?" he said 
angrily. "Anyhow, you can't 
transplant an old tree. If she got 
it, she never knew it." 

"Oh, I hope so!" 

"We're going to have all we 



THE YEAt OP THE JACKPOT 



39 



can do to take care of ourselves. 
Take the flashlight and check the 
map. I want to turn north at Taft 
and over toward the coast." 
"Yes, Potiphar." 

CHE quieted down and did as 
K -' she was told. The radio gave 
nothing, not even the Riverside 
station; the whole broadcast 
range was covered by a curious 
Static, like rain on a window. 

He slowed down as they approached Taft, let her spot the 
turn north onto the state road, 
and turned into it. Almost at 
once a figure jumped out into the 
road in front of them, waved his 
arms violently. Breen tromped on 
the brake. 

The man came up on the left 
side of the car, rapped on the 
window. Breen ran the glass 
down. Then he stared stupidly at 
the gun in the man's left hand. 

"Out of the car," the stranger 
said sharply. "I've got to have it." 

Meade reached across Breen, 
stuck her little lady's gun in the 
man's face and pulled the trigger. 
Breen could feel the flash on his 
own face, never noticed the report. The man looked puzzled, 
with a neat, not -yet-bloody hole 
in his upper lip — then slowly 
sagged away from the car. 

"Drive on!" Meade said in a 
high voice. 

Breen caught his breath. "But 

yOU '* 



"Drive on! Get rolling!" 

They followed the state road 
through Los Padres National 
Forest, stopping once to fill the 
tank from their cans. They turned 
off onto a dirt road. Meade kept 
trying the radio, got San Francisco once, but it was too jammed 
with static to read. Then she got 
Salt Lake City, faint but clear; 

" — since there are no reports of 
anything passing our radar screen, 
the Kansas City bomb must be 
assumed to have been planted 
rather than delivered. This is a 
tentative theory, but — " 

They passed into a deep cut 
and lost the rest. 

When the squawk box again 
came to life, it was a crisp new 
voice : "Air Defense Command, 
coming to you over the combined 
networks. The rumor that Los 
Angeles has been hit by an atom 
bomb is totally unfounded. It is 
true that the western metropolis 
has suffered a severe earthquake 
shock, but that is all. Government officials and the Red Cross 
are on the spot to care for the 
victims, but — and I repeat — there 
has been no atomic bombing. So 
relax and stay in your homes. 
Such wild rumors can damage 
the United States quite as much 
as enemy bombs. Stay off the 
highways and listen for — " 

Breen snapped it off. "Somebody," he said bitterly, "has again 
decided that 'Mama knows best.' 



M 




 




They won't tell us any bed news.** 
"Potiphar," Meade said 
sharply, "that was an atom bomb, 
wasn't it?" 

"It was. And now we don't 
know whether it was just Los Angeles — and Kansas City— or every 
big city in the country. All we 
know is that they are lying to us." 

He concentrated on driving. 
The road was very bad. 

AS it began to get fight, she 
■** said, "Potty, do you know 
where we're going? Are we just 
keeping out of cities?" 

**I think I know. H I'm not 
lost." He stared around them. 



"Nope, it's all right. See that hill 
up forward with the triple gendarmes on its profile?" 
"Gendarmes?" 

"Big rock pillars. That's • sure 
landmark. I'm looking for a 
private road now. It leads to a 
hunting lodge belonging to two of 
my friends — an old ranch house 
actually, but as a ranch it didn't 
pay." 

"They won't mind us using it?** 
He shrugged. "If they show up, 

we*ll ask them. // they show up. 

They lived in Los Angeles." 
The private road had once been 

a poor grade of wagon trail; now it 

was almost impassable. But they

finally topped a hogback from 
which they could see almost to 
the Pacific, then dropped down 
into a sheltered bowl where the 
cabin was. 

"All out, girl. End of the line." 

Meade signed. "It looks heavenly." 

"Think you can rustle breakfast while I unload? There's probably wood in the shed. Or can 
you manage a wood range?" 

"Just try me." 

Two hours later Breen was 
standing on the hogback, smoking 
a cigarette and staring off down 
to the west. He wondered if that 
was a mushroom cloud up San 
Francisco way. Probably his imagination, he decided, in view of 
the distance. Certainly there was 
nothing to be seen to the south. 

Meade came out of the cabin. 
"Potty!" 

"Up here." 

She joined him, took his hand 
and smiled, then snitched his cigarette and took a deep drag. She 
exhaled it and said, "I know it's 
sinful of me, but I feel more 
peaceful than I have in months." 

"I know." 

"Did you see the canned 
goods in that pantry? We could 
pull through a hard winter here." 

"We might have to." 

"I suppose. I wish we had a 
cow." 

"What would you do with c 
cow?" 



"I used to milk four of them 
before I caught the school bus, 
every morning. I can butcher a 
hog, too." 

"I'll try to find you a hog." 

"You do and I'll manage to 
smoke it." She yawned. "I'm suddenly terribly sleepy." 

"So am I. And small wonder." 

"Let's go to bed." 

"Uh, yes. Meade?" 

"Yes, Potty?" 

"We may be here quite a while. 
You know that, don't you?" 
"Yes. Potty." 

"In fact, it might be smart to 
stay put until those curves all 
start turning up again. They 
should, you know." 

"Yes. I had figured that out." 

He hesitated, then went on, 
"Meade, will you marry me?" 

"Yes." She moved up to him. 

After a time he pushed her 
gently away and said, "My dear, 
my very dear — uh — we could 
drive down and find a minister in 
some little town." 

She looked at him steadily. 
"That wouldn't be very bright, 
would it? I mean, nobody knows 
we're here and that's the way we 
want it. Besides, your car might 
not make it back up that road." 

"No, it wouldn't be very 
bright. But I want to do the right 
thing." 

"It's all right, Potty. It's all 
right." • 

"Well, then . . . kneel down 



8 A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



here with me. We'll say them 
together." 

"Yes, Potiphar." She knelt and 
he took her hand. He closed his 
eyes and prayed wordlessly. 

When he opened them he said, 
"What's the matter?" 

"The gravel hurts my knees." 

"We'll stand up, then." 

"No. Look, Potty, why don't 
we just go in the house and say 
them there?" 

"Huh? Hell's bells, woman, we 
might forget to say them entirely. 
Now repeat after me: I, Potiphar, 
take thee. Meade — "

BE CAREFUL; IT MIGHT BE AUNT 
TESSIE. OFF AND CLEAR. UNTIL 
NOON TOMORROW—" 

npHE statistical curves were 
turning up again. There was 
no longer doubt in Breen's mind 
about that. It might not even be 
necessary to stay up here in the 
Sierra Madres through the winter, 
though he rather thought they 
would. It would be silly to be 
mowed down by the tail of a dying epidemic, or be shot by a 
nervous vigilante, when a few 
months' wait would take care of 
everything. 

He was headed out to the hogback to wait for sunset and do 
an hour's reading. He glanced 
at his car as he passed it, thinking 
that he would like to try the radio. 
He suppressed the yen; twothirds of his reserve gasoline was 
gone already just from keeping 
the battery charged for the radio 
—and here it was only December. 
He really ought to cut it down to 
twice a week. But it meant a lot 
to catch the noon bulletin of 
Free America and then twiddle 
the dial a few minutes to see what 
else he could pick up. 



But for the past three days 
Free America had not been on 
the air — solar static maybe, or 
perhaps just a power failure. But 
that rumor that President Brandley had been assassinated — it 
hadn't come from the Free radio 
and it hadn't been denied by 
them, either, which was a good 
sign. 

Still, it worried him. 

And that other story that lost 
Atlantis *had pushed up during 
the quake period and that the 
Azores were now a little continent — almost certainly a hangover of the "silly season" — but 
it would be nice to hear a followup. 

Rather sheepishly, he let his 
feet carry him to the car. It 
wasn't fair to listen when Meade 
wasn't around. He warmed it up. 
slowly spun the dial, once around 
and back. Not a peep at full gain, 
nothing but a terrible amount of 
static. 

Served him right. 

He climbed the hogback, sat 
down on the bench he had 
dragged up there — their "memorial bench," sacred to the 
memory of the time Meade had 
bruised her knees on the gravel 
— sat down and sighed. His lean 
belly was stuffed with venison 
and corn fritters; he lacked only 
tobacco to make him completely 
happy. 

The evening cloud colors were

spectacularly beautiful and the 
weather was extremely balmy for 
December; both, he thought, 
caused by volcanic dust, with perhaps an assist from atom bombs. 

Surprising how fast things went 
to pieces when they started to 
skid! And surprising how quickly 
they were going back together, 
judging by the signs. A curve 
reaches trough and then starts 
right back up. 

World War III was the shortest 
big war on record — forty cities 
gone, counting Moscow and the 
other slave cities as well as the 
American ones — and then 
whoosh! neither side fit to fight. 

Of course, the fact that both 
sides had thrown their Sunday 
punch over the North Pole 
through the most freakish arctic 
weather since Peary invented the 
place had a lot to do with it, he 
supposed. 

It was amazing that any of the 
Russian paratroop transports had 
gotten through at all. 

T>REEN sighed and pulled the 
November 1951 copy of the 
Western Astronomer out of his 
pocket. Where was he? Oh, yes, 
Some Notes on the Stability of 
G-Type Stars with Especial Reference to Sol, by Dynkowski, 
Lenin Institute, translated by 
Heinrich Ley, F. R. A.S. 

Good boy, Ski — sound mathematician. Very clever application 




of harmonic series and tightly 
reasoned. 

Breen started to thumb for his 
place when he noticed a footnote 
that he had missed. Dynkowski*s 
own name carried down to it: 
"This monograph was denounced 
by Pravda as 'romantic reactionaryism' shortly after it was published. Professor Dynkowski has 
been unreported since and must 
be presumed to be liquidated." 

The poor geek! Well, he probably would have been atomized 
by now anyway, along with the 
goons who did him in. He wondered if the army really had gotten all the Russki paratroopers. 
He had killed his own quota; if 
he hadn't gotten that doe within 
a quarter-mile of the cabin and 
headed right back, Meade would 
have had a bad time. He had shot 
them in the back and buried them 
beyond the woodpile. 

He settled down to some solid 
pleasure. Dynkowski was a treat. 
Of course, it was old stuff that a 
G-type star, such as the Sun, was 
potentially unstable; a G-O-star 
could explode, slide right off the 
Russell diagram, and end up as a 
white dwarf. But no one before 
Dynkowski had defined the exact 
conditions for such a catastrophe, 
nor had anyone else devised 
mathematical means of diagnosing the instability and describing 
its progress. 

He looked up to rest his eyes 



THE YEAR OF THE JACKPOT 



35 



from the fine print and saw that 
the Sun was obscured by a thin 
low cloud — one of those unusual 
conditions where the filtering effect is just right to permit a man 
to view the Sun clearly with the 
naked eye. Probably volcanic 
dust in the air, he decided, acting 
almost like smoked glass. 

He looked again. Either he had 
spots before his eyes or that was 
one fancy big Sun spot. He had 
heard of being able to see them 
with the naked eye, but it had 
never happened to him." 

He longed for a telescope. 

He blinked. Yep, it was still 
there, about three o'clock. A big 
spot — no wonder the car radio 
sounded like a Hitler speech. 

HE turned back and continued 
on to the end of the article, 
being anxious to finish before the 
light failed. 

At first his mood was sheerest 
intellectual pleasure at the man's 
tight mathematical reasoning. A 
three per cent imbalance in the 
solar constant — yes, that was 
standard stuff; the Sun would 
nova with that much change. But 
Dynkowski went further. By 
means of a novel mathematical 
operator which he had dubbed 
"yokes," he bracketed the period 
in a star's history when this could 
happen and tied it down with 
secondary, tertiary, and quaternary yokes, showing exactly the 



time of highest probability. 

Beautiful! Dynkowski even assigned dates to the extreme limit 
of his primary yoke, as a good 
statistician should. 

But. as Breen went back and 
reviewed the equations, his mood 
changed from intellectual to personal. Dynkowski was not talking 
about just any G-O star. In the 
latter part, he meant old Sol himself, Breen's personal Sun — the 
big boy out there with the oversize freckle on his face. 

That was one hell of a big 
freckle! It was a hole you could 
chuck Jupiter into and not make 
a splash. He could see it very 
clearly now. 

Everybody talks about "wheo 
the stars grow old and the Sua 
grows cold," but it's an impersonal concept, like one's ows 
death. 

Breen started thinking about it 
very personally. How long would 
it take, from the instant the imbalance was triggered until the 
expanding wave front engulfed 
Earth? The mechanics couldn't 
be solved without a calculation, 
even though they were implicit in 
the equations in front of him. 
Half an hour, for a horseback 
guess, from incitement until the 
Earth went phutt! 

It hit him with gentle melancholy. No more? Never again?

He suddenly felt the need for 
Meade and stood up. 

SHE was coming out to meet 
him. "Hello. Potty! Safe to

dishes." 

"! should help.** 
"You do the man's work; I'll

"Sit down and we'll watch it.** 
She sat beside htm. 



"Notice the Sun spot? You can

She stared. "Is that a Sun spot? 
It looks as if somebody had taken 
a bite out of it." 

He squinted his eyes at it again. 
Damned if it didn't look bigger! 

Meade shivered. "I'm chilly. 
Put your arm around me." 

He did so with his free arm, continuing to hold hands with tht 
other. 

It was bigger. The spot wai 
growing. 

What good is the race of man?

with a touch of poetry in them,

"It will be warmer soon — I 
mean I'll keep you warm." 

"Dear Potty." She looked up. 
"Potty, sorAething funny is happening to the sunset." 

"No. darling — to the Sun."

to add up the two figures and divide by two to reach the answer. 
Instead he clutched fiercely at her
