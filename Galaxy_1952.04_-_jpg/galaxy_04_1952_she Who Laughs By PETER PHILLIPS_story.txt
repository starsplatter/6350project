she Who Laughs By PETER PHILLIPS

I'D been waiting two hundred 
years for this guy. 
He stood there in the graveled driveway with the estate 
agent, looking over the frontage 
of the mansion. 

The sun was hot. The agent 
took off his hat, mopped his 
balding head. I wondered whether 
I could spit that far from the upstairs window where I was watching them. I decided I probably 
could, but I wouldn't. 

The agent said, in a thick 
brogue I can't reproduce in its 
glottal richness: "If it's se clusion 



SHE WHO LAUGHS 



you're wantin', Mr. Mullen, you'd 
not better this foine upstandin' 
place this soide of Ballygore. 
There's room to stretch your legs 
and fill your lungs with air that 
shweeps down from the mountains over covert and shweet pasture for your own special delectation and delight.*' 

My lips were moving with his. 
I'd heard it before. I knew the 
sucker would take the place. And 
I knew the agent, back in 
Thaughbeen, having dropped 
most of his beautiful stage 
brogue, would soon be saying: 
"He's paying in dollars, too, boys. 
And then, in the season, I'll sell 
them to the English tourists. This 
is an occasion to celebrate. Porter 
ell round; on me." 

Mullen, casual as all hell, 
standing there with the agent, 
pretended to be considering. 

I whisked down the balusterrail, stood just behind the door 
es they came in. 

"Nice hall,'" Mullen said unenthusiastically. He was wearing 
a drape suit. He didn't need 
drapes to bulk him out. Those 
shoulders had spearheaded the 
forward line three seasons at col'Jege, if my information was correct. 

Indignant, the agent said: 
"Nice? It's talking like an Englishman you are, instead of a 
citizen o' the greatest country in 
the world." ("Bar Ireland," he 



added under his breath.) "Lookit 
the si2e of ut— the staircase, the 
paneling, the great wide windows, 
and that landin' there where the 
mighty O'Rourke stood and with 
the Sword of Kings defied the 
brayin' cowards o' Cromwell till 
he was struck a traitor blow 
from behind, and, like a greatgirthed tree smitten in its prime, 
fell among the cur-dogs and carried a full half-dozen of them 
to death with him. Here at this 
very spot!" 

The agent flung out a dramatic hand. I'd crept up behind 
them during the spiel. I never tire 
of hearing it. 

Mullen stepped back. I dodged. 

"Fool place to make a stand 
anyway," he muttered, looking at 
the balcony between the two 
staircases. 

"Arragh! The O'Rourke could 
foight as well with the two hands 
as the one. A sword in each, there 
he stood, facin' them both 
ways — " 

"Sure, sure. Now how many 
bedrooms did you say?" 

I followed them around. Mullen wasn't interested in bedrooms, 
only in the cellar. But I was 
waiting for the final spiel, dictated by what the agent retained 
of a conscience. 

"There's jist one small matter," 
he said, standing in the hall again 
after they'd looked the place 
over. "You may have been hearin*

lies about this place in Thaughbeen, maybe from those loafers 
around Golighan's bar, and 
though I wouldn't be askin' yez 
to disregard ut entoirely — " 

"The haunt, you mean?" said 
Mullen. I grinned to myself. "I 
heard about it during the war 
when I was stationed just across 
the border. That's when I became 
interested in the place. I looked 
it over, saw the power plant. 
There's quite a head of water in 
that stream. The memory of that 
stayed in the back of my mind 
until the other day, when I was 
in London with my wife, seeing 
some friends. Then I remembered 
this place. I have some work to 
do. I want electrical power and 
privacy. So I hopped the jet liner 
to Dublin and came up here — " 

"And you'll take it, sorr? 
Ghost an' all?" 

If Mullen paid extra for a 
ghost, I thought, he'd be thoroughly had. But he said firmly: 
"I'm not buying your ghost. In 
another minute you'll be saying 
it's an asset to the place. It's a 
hundred years since my folk left 
this country, but we haven't gone 
soft. What's your price for this 
tumbledown she-been?" 

"The final price," said the 
agent, taking a deep, careful 
breath, "for a year's tenancy, in 
advance, in dollars, is — how much 
did you offer?" 



"I didn't. But you can tell 
your client I'll pay a thousand." 

"Don't be shamin' me," said 
the agent, as I blew a cool breath 
down his neck. "It's meself that 
owns the place as you well know, 
if you know as much as you do." 

He drew up his coat collar. 
"Now let's be discussin' the details elsewhere." 

T FOLLOWED them down the 
-■■ drive, into the shay. I could 
get away from the place now for 
a while. 

It was late afternoon. The 
green border hills in the distance 
were drawing up mist from the 
shadowed bog as their green 
darkened in the slanting sun; and 
the new-cut hay in the nearer 
fields brought relished delight. 

Two hundred years I'd waited 
for this jaunt. I enjoyed every 
second of it, even the acrid stink 
from Pethal's ill-cared-for hogs 
as we passed the holding. The 
hoppity-clop of the pony's hoofs 
on the dust-blown road was 
music. 

Over the green-lichened bridge 
by the trout stream trotted the 
pony. I promised myself to do 
some fishing there soon.. I'd use 
a quiet worm and snooze in the 
sun. Fly-fishing was too strenuous in this moist heat. 

And I'd look over my 'shoulder 
now and again at the long pile 
of Thaughkeen House and lau&&

The laugh would be on me. That 
always makes it funnier, in Ireland. 

Down from the bridge, and* the 
road broadened into the village 
of Thaughbeen. 

The agent introduced Mullen 
to Golighan. "Stationed in the 
Six Counties durin* the war," he 
said, "and mindful of the beauties of the country, and wishin' 
to do a little book-work or such, 
decided to take over the place for 
a year or maybe more, And you'll 
be wastin' your time, Michael, me 
boy, tellin' him about the haunt 
to take the bread out of me very 
mouth, for Mister Mullen knows 
all about it." 

"Sit down and rest the onaisy 
tongue of yez," said Golighan, 
trying^ to outdo the agent's 
brogue. "Y'don't think he'd be 
taken in onyway by yer gabblin', 
wid a name loike Mullen. What'll 
you drink?" 

Mullen ordered Jamieson's 
Irish whisky. The agent took 
thick Dublin stout. 

I watched Mullen roll the 
smokey-peat flavor around his 
tongue. Two hundred years since 
I'd had the sweet, rare tang of 
it tickling my gullet . . . 

I licked invisible lips in anticipation. 

They stayed through the evening, with the real talk beginning 
when the lads drifted in. 

There was Sean Healey, Tom 



O'Reilly — both, if I remembered 
right, working a pittance on Lord 
Freightowel's estate. Seamas 
Mulvaney, smallholder — how 
many times had I seen him, as a 
barefoot gossoon, nicking plums 
from the kitchen .garden at 
Thaughbeen House, looking often 
at the silent, window-eyed place 
with his own green, feary eyes, 
and me at an upstairs window 
holding in my breath not to give 
one of the ghostly groans I'd 
practiced so long and send him in 
a tear -breeches scramble down 
the tree. 

Then there was gutsy Bran 
Bailey who'd actually come inside one night, stood in the hall 
and with all his big little heart 
bawled: "The hell an' back wid 
banshees! T don't believe in 'em!" 

I'd been so pleased with his 
common sense that I forgot myself and called out the truth : 
"Good for you, kid. I'm no 
banshee. I'm no kind of goddam 
ghost. There's no such things." 

But poor Bran was running so 
fast, I doubted he'd heard me. 

Anyway, here he was in Golighan's, grown big and broad, and 
putting in his two cents' worth 
about the goings-on at Thaughbeen House. 

"It was during the war," Bran 
said, "and, being so near the border, we had a jeepful of your 
fellers running in here every night 
to stoke up on Mister Golighan's 



t24 




 



brew. And one night we tell them 
about the House, and about how 
poor daft Johnnie Maur goes up 
there now and again to play chess 
with the ghost, as he said. Poor 
Johnnie, gone eleven months 
now — " 

Johnnie was dead? I'd missed 
him. 

Every time I heard that Johnnie was dead, it shocked me. 

He'd stumble into the House, 
liquored up to the fringe of his 
red hair, white face vacant and 
mild, shouting in the empty echoing half: 

"It's a game of chess I'm offerin' yez, for, banshees or not, 
ye're the only dacent player this 
soide of Dublin who can tax me 
wandhering wits!" 

I hope Johnnie's found another 
"dacent player," wherever Tie's 
gone. 

Bran Bailey was talking on in 
Golighan's bar, with Mullen leaning forward and taking it all in. 

"So one night," says Bran, "the 
whole near- dozen of 'em starts 
off up there, with this great roarin' 
sergeant straddHn' the front and 
shoutin' : 'Look out, ghost, here 
we come, eight little Yankee boys 
full of rum!' 

"And the jeep goin' so slow 
with them aboard," says Bran, 
"and the rain makin' a bog of 
the road, we follow after these 
fellers to see what the Thaughbeen House ghost does with 'em. 



••And they get halfway up the 
drive to the house, and the jeep 
stops, and there's the driver 
thumpin' and pullin' everything 
and callin' on all the saints, until 
the sergeant unstraddles himself 
and pulls up the front coverin'. 

"Then he jist stands there, rain 
sweatin' off his" great red face 
and him suddenly as sober as a 
hangin' judge on a Monday, and 
he says: 'Put it back! Put it back 
quick before I believe my eyes, 
and I swear I'll never touch another drop again!' And we come 
up and look over his shoulder. 

"And there's nothing there under the hood. Nothing at all, at 
all." 

I hadn't meant to swipe the 
the whole motor at first. The teleport exhausted me for days. But 
I got annoyed when I'd yanked 
off three plug-leads and that 
damned jeep kept banging away 
on one cylinder. 

"And never a sight of the motor 
since," concluded Bran Bailey. 

Said Mullen: "Yes. I heard of . 
it. I was captain of their unit. 
We had to have the jeep towed 
away." 

"So you're not troublin* yourself about the creature at all?" 
asked Sean Healey. 

"Why should I? It's never 
harmed anybody, far as I can 
see." 

Thanks for them kind words, 
pal. 



SHE WHO IAUGHS 



ing," was all I said. 

"So does this whole situation. 
Hey, if these forecasts of yours 
turn out right, how about giving 
me the winners at Ballymuchray 
this afternoon?" 

Mullen was recovering pretty 
quickly, it seemed. 

I said: "I don't play the horses. 
If you've finished down here, you 
might as well get up to the 
kitchen and make yourself some 
coffee. No need to check that 
wiring any more. I've already 
done it. You've got a lazy morning ahead." 

"The morning," he said, "hasn't 
yet started. I'm not awake yet." 

"So now I'm part of a dream, 
am I? Get upstairs before I bat 
you with a clod of hard air." 

Hf muttered his way up to the 
kitchen, plunked an open pot on 
the stove, which he'd already 
lighted. Blue smoke puffed intermittently between the bars, filling 
the place with pungent haze. 

Mullen looked up at the ceiling, addressed it politely: "I suppose, Mr. Fixit, you can tell me 
what's wrong with this thing?" 

"Naturally. Get hold of the 
poker and belt that flue pipe 
about halfway up. The plate's 
jammed and doesn't operate from 
the outside. Shank broke off way 
back." 

He belted. The fire roared up 
suddenly. 

"Thanks," he said. "Could I 

us 



interest you in a cup of coffee?" 
"Very funny," I grunted sourly. 

WHILE he sipped his brew, I 
slipped out to tell my "wife" 
how things were shaping up. My 
wife was born to lay the eggs and 
crow as well. I'd suffered two 
hundred years of hell from her 
tongue. Blamed me for everything. She even beefed about my 
innocent games of chess with 
Johnnie Maur. 

And I remember when the 
Marchmont family was in occupation of Thaughbeen House, 
she'd scare half the life out of 
little Lilian Marchmont just because I happened to remark casually on her good looks. That gives 
you a picture of my wife — a possessive shrew, to keep it in human 
terms which really don't apply 
very well. 

She started in on me now, so 
I grabbed up the chess board and 
pieces from the attic and skipped 
down from the Tenth Plane, 
where she was lying up and waiting for me to do most of the 
work. 

When I got back to the kitchen, 
Mullen was tapping at the walls 
and ceiling with a broomstick. 

"No secret panels or hidden 
amplifiers," I said. "It's all genuine physical phenomena." 

He looked round and breathed 
heavily. "Now I've seen everything." 


 



Mullen decided to stay at Golighan's until a few essentials had 
been carried up to the House. 
Meantime, he wired his wife to 
join him. 

"pOUR days later, he took up 
residence. He came early. But 
early. The energy of that man! I 
was still resting when I heard 
him poking around in the cellars, 
tracing through the wiring from 
the turbo-house. 

I slipped down from where I 
go when I take a rest — don't ask 
me where that is; it's a state, not 
a place — and gummed down after 
him. He was lifting a tarpaulin 
in a corner of one of the smaller 
cellars: it used to be a cold-larder. 

He looked at the jeep motor 
and* made funny disbelieving 
noises. 

-"So," I said, "it wasn't the 
potheen. I figure you owe the 
sergeant and the other Company 
D boys one big-handed apology — ■ 
plus the dough you docked 'era 
• to pay for it." 

He came around so fast, he 
tripped and planted the tight part 
of his pants on one of the hobbly 
bits of the jeep motor. 

"What — where are you?" 

"Not in heaven or in hell, but 
just as elusive as the Pimpernel. 
As to what I am, you're going to 
tell me, I hope. That's what I've 
been waiting for — a long, long 
time. Meanwhile, Mr. Mullen," 



I said, "you're soiling those nicely 
creased pants of yours." 

He upped off the engine, dusted 
his pants automatically. Something the Army did for him — 
gave him a pride in his clothes. 

"Do you mind," he said, his 
brain beginning to work, "showing yourself? I hate like hell accepting sartorial advice from a 
voice without a body." 

"That takes energy," I said, 
"like compressing these air molecules to make sound waves. But 
it takes a lot of energy and a 
lot of material and right now I 
don't feel like dressing up to give 
you something to look at or talk 
at. However, I don't mind giving 
you a slight idea. Scrape some 
dust off those shelves, toss it up 
under that bulb, and stand back." 

"I am nuts," he enunciated 
carefully. 

"Sure. But do it. And mind 
your coat cuffs." 

As the cloud of tiny particles 
drifted down, I slipped in and 
charged them so they hung 
around the vortices of my antiparticles. 

"Almighty catfish !" Mullen 
gulped. "A naked ghost!" 

"I'm no ghost, and I don't have 
to be this shape, either," I said, 
adjusting the network. "Ir this 
any better? Dogs are always 
naked." 

He backed off, slapping at the 
air. "For God's sake, be human 




 



if you can't be natural! I mean — " 

"Listen," I said, peeved, "that 
was a prize mastiff I once saw. I 
can always do a mountain lion 
or a grizzly. Get me a roll of 
cheesecloth, or even a bedsheet 
at a pinch, and I'll really show 
you something." 

"I've seen enough," he said, 
digging knuckles in his eyes and 
shaking his head as if something 
was loose inside. "Go away." 

"Maybe you're right. I've got 
more important things to do with 
my energy than fool around to 
amuse you." 

"Amuse me?" He made a noise 
like an emptying bathtub. "I'd 
laugh easier in a morgue. Get 
back where you came from and 
make the worms laugh." 

"I'm not," I repeated patiently, 
"a ghost, a ghoulie, a banshee, 
or anything of the whatsoever 
kind. I've never met up with one 
and I don't expect to. Like young 
Bran Bailey, I don't believe in 
'cm. Neither do you, fortunately. 
But explanations can wait. Has 
any of the stuff turned up yet?" 

That got him. "What stuff?" 

"Couple of tubes from Marshall's of London, specification alloy plates from Birmingham, that 
dingus you borrowed from the 
Sorbonne." 

"Your intelligence service must 
be good." 

"You'd be surprised." 

"Then you tell me where it is." 



"I was just making conversation," I said. "It's on the way to 
Thaughbeen station now. Johnny 
McGuire will be carting it over 
around lunchtime. And your wife, 
who is wondering what in hell 
you're up to anyway, has reluctantly left her bright friends in 
London and is on her way to ask 
why you took over this motheaten old shack without consulting her first, especially since it's 
her money you're fooling around 
with." 

Mullen's lower jaw was nearly 
resting on his collar by this time. 

"Incidentally." I asked, "how 
is the darling girl? Has she enjoyed the European tour so far?" 

"Leave her out of this," he 
managed to say. But his tone 
was defensive. 

"Poor Mullen." I sighed. "She's 
still keeping the reins on you, 
huh? I pity you, feller. I know 
just how it is. I'm under the Iron 
High Heel myself. You'll have 
to meet my wife sometime." 

"This is too much! Two of you? 
Too damned much! A double 
haunt!" Mullen frowned. Then he 
began to laugh at his own sudden 
thoughts. "How do you make 
out, mister?" 

I considered explaining to him, 
but decided he'd never understand. "Wife" was the simplest 
way I could describe "her" — the 
only way in earthly language. 

"Your mind needs deodoriz

I dumped the chess board and 
pieces on the kitchen table. 

"No," he said. "No! I'm not 
going to confirm myself in my 
own madness. Take 'em away." 

I started setting out the pieces. 
He watched with a kind of horrible deadpan fascination. In a 
faraway voice he said: "Queen 
on her own color." 

"That's better," I told him. 
"Pull up a chair." 

He went to the kitchen window, 
looked at the soft sunlight glancing through the apple trees. He 
looked for quite a while. Then 
he shrugged, grabbed a chair and 
came back to the table. 

"Anywhere but Ireland," he 
observed, "I'd have run halfway 
to Thaughbeen by now." 

Twice during the game, which 
stretched out over three hours, 
he tried to make talk, but I 
dodged the questions. Once he 
made a grab in the air over my 
QKt as I was making a move. 

"Can you," I asked politely, 
"feel a magnetic field? Or an airCurrent, if your hand is moving 
with it? Or put a half-nelson on 
a frame of reference? Or poke 
a De Sitter anti-particle in the 
eye?" 

He gave up. 

Finally, as we heard the clattering roar of McGuire's cartage 
van down the road, he said : "This 
is the damnedest game, in more 
than one sense. Check. Hold it 



until I'm back in this room.** 

I heard them dumping the stuff 
into the hall; and a female voice 
ordering the carter around; and 
the bland, blarneying voice of 
McGuire somehow soaring above 
the authoritative female voice 
and quelling it 

When Mullen came back into 
the kitchen, he looked determined. 
He closed the door carefully behind him. 

"McGuire," he said, "is a 
breath of fresh air. Sanity returns. I've just realized what I've 
been doing all morning. I have 
a hell of a lot of work on hand 
and I can't get on with it until 
this is straightened out. And I'm 
not going to have my wife scared. 
Now just what are you, and 
what's your racket?" 

"Patience, pal," I said. "Finish the game, then I'll talk. I 
fixed you some fresh coffee." 
Voices were raised again in the 
hall. "Incidentally, I don't think 
your wife scares easy. She's busy 
for a while anyway. Your move." 

He gulped coffee, watched me 
interpose on his check and 
threaten his own king simultaneously. He was compelled to exchange pieces, which made it a 
draw. 

"You've been playing for that," 
he accused. 

I sighed. "Not deliberately. If 
we played a dozen games, they'd 
end up on a draw. Or a stale


SHE WHO LAUGHS 



mate. One or the other." 

"I don't get it. Quit the crosstalk. What are you?" 

HE sat more easily in his chair. 
He frowned at the coffee. I 
hoped I hadn't laced it too much. 
He'd get the idea soon enough 
anyway. 

-* "You've got a couple of books 
in your bag," I said. "One is a 
pretty detailed family history of 
this place, written and published 
at his own expense — because no 
one else would be interested — by 
Mister Patrick O'Rourke, Gentleman, at the turn of the century. 

^ "There are only passing, deprecatory references to me in that. 
He never took kindly to the idea 
of ^family banshee, or banshees. 
The other was written twenty 
years ago by an earnest and sober 
investigator from the English 
Psychical Research Society. It's 
my biography. My wife, being 
what you'd call plumb lazy, never 
made an appearance for him. I've 
often regretted that the Society 
never got around to following up 
his report. I'd have shown 'em 
plenty." 

"Then you are a haunt," Mullen said. "A plain, ornery haunt! 
But how do you tick? How do 
you move things around?" 

"A disembodied psyche — " I 
began. 

That got him. He snapped up 
straight and mouthed for breath. 



Coffee slopped over the table. It 
didn't matter. He'd drunk enough 
for my purpose. 

"A disembodied psyche," I repeated firmly, "which is a focus 
of consciousness freed from hindering matter, and thus from the 
bonds of inertia and entropy, not 
to mention sex, can be a pretty 
powerful thing. It doesn't upset 
any energy balance because it 
utilizes extant potentials." 

His eyes were growing rounder. 
He tried to get up, then slumped 
back. 

"You soon master the mechanics of perception for yourself," I 
said. "It's largely a matter of 
that curious mental force called 
imagination. And you learn how 
to induce illusion in others. But 
it takes about ten years before 
you find a way to store enough 
free energy from cosmic sources 
in your own field-web of antiparticles to move solid objects 
around." 

He had trouble with his voice. 
"Ten years? Ten year from 
when?" 

"From pretty damn soon," X 
said sweetly. 

"Then you're — you're — " He 
gulped. His eyes were glazing. 

"That's right," I said. "Slerep 
tight, brother." 

I was testing the last circuit 
when lie came around. He opened 
his eyes and moaned a little. 

"Don't worry about the slight 



130 




 



hangover," I said. "I'll be taking 
it over in a moment." 

He looked around at the setup. 
Only his head could move. The 
rest of him was tied pretty firmly 
in the stasis area. 

"Pretty neat, huh?" I said. "It 
would have taken you months. 
Years, maybe. It probably did — 
once. That's something I've never 
figured out. It took me four hours 
flat,*even with the know-how. I 
had two hundred years to work 
it out." 

Mullen muttered : "It's a 
dream." 

"Check. That's how the thing 
started, if it ever did start. With 
Dunne's theories of precognition 
and post- cognition in dreams — 
a freed psyche moving backward 
and forward in time. Or, as in 
this case, staying put and letting 
time flow by. No mass, so no 
trouble with entropy or inertia. 
All the paradoxes of time travel 
smoothed out." 

He'd gone bug-eyed again. I 
could almost see his brain wriggling. 

"What happens when I — when 
you — when this body dies?" 

"You answered that question 
when you devised the math," I 
said. "Does the past die? No. 
It's co-existent. Effective immortality." 

"But death—" 

"Is pretty final," I agreed. 
"Dust to dust, et cetera. And 



since we don't believe in an afterlife, that makes it a tough problem. But you've got a couple of 
centuries to figure that one out, 
too." 

"You mean you have figured 
it?" 

• "I didn't. You didn't. We 
didn't. We never will because wc 
never have." 

"How many times has this happened?" 

"Once," I said patiently. "This 
is the first time. It always is.' 1 

"But with memory of this conversation, I can change the pattern! I can — " 

Then he got the idea. His 
mouth dropped open. Slackjawed dope . . . 

"That's it," I said. I felt sorry 
for him, as usual. "You've already tried everything. You can't 
even leave the place until this 
turns up." I prodded his stomach. 
"It's the only body our psychic 
matrix will fit into, and there's 
a psychic compulsion to stay right 
here until it arrives. You can't 
lick time. You never could." 

T STOOD by the switch. The 
tubes began to heat up. 

"No!" he yelled. "Hold it! 
About my wife — " 

"Our wife," I corrected him, 
looking around cautiously. This 
time I might get away with it. 
Maybe the pattern wouldn't always be the same. It was worth 



SHE WHO LAUGHS 



131 



trying anyway. "You'll find her 
on the Tenth Plane when you 
figure out how to get there." 

I gave him the wave-off sign. 
"I've got a date with a bottle of 
Jamieson's Irish whisky and a 
fishing rod. By the way, when 
you meet up with old Johnnie 
Maur again, give him my love. 
He won't understand. He never 
does. Look out for his rook game 
in the end-play. So long, sucker," 
I said. "Good haunting." 

T WAS reaching for the switch, 
when — 

"Hold it or I'll blast you!" 

I sighed resignedly and looked 
at the cellar steps, A body 
slumped inelegantly into view, 
dangling like a puppet from invisible strings. 

The voice came from above its 
head. 

How I hate that voice! 

"Dear, sweet Bernie," cooed 
my wife dangerously. "Trying it 
again? Don't you ever learn? 
If you touch that switch before 
my say-so, I'll fry that body of 
yours as soon as spit in your 
eye." 

Mullen choked : "That's Betty !" 

"Uh-huh," I murmured. "And 
that's Betty's body. She wants it 
back. I always try to leave her 
behind, but I guess I never succeed. I'd like to try living with a 
wife I haven't lived with for two 
hundred years. But she's spent 



months soaking up energy on the 
Tenth Plane, and if I don't play 
ball, she'll burn my body before 
I get it." 

"How right, darling," said 
Betty. Arsenic and molasses in 
that voice. "Now tie this down in 
the stasis field." 

I looked at the limp, blonde 
head and laughed. "I suppose you 
whanged her with the skillet 
again?" 

"That's my headache," the 
voice snapped. 

"Right! That's why I'm laughing, sweetheart." 

I laid Betty's unconscious head 
near Mullen's — that is, near my 
shoulder. She stirred a little and 
moaned. I passed ropes over her 
and through the ring-bolt of the 
time lock and stood back admiring the scene. 

"Don't we look sweet?" I said. 

"Beautiful," said Betty. "Now 
pull that switch." . 

I went to the handle. 

"No — " pleaded Mullen. 

"Yes," ordered Betty. 

I pulled. 

For a mi Hi -second, a soft, impossible wind soughed through 
inter galactic nothingness. A condition of no-life. Binary stars 
flamed into view. Incorporate 
with a star, become corporeal, or 
cease. An incredible longing, fu/filled at its conception. Homing 
to this srar— No! Get out! Occupied! Incorporate or cease! 




 



»T*HE time lock snapped open, 
and ropes loosened round my 
body. 
Body. 

Beautiful word. 

Even with a headache like this. 

Headache! 

I gave a little scream and sat 
up. 

Mullen — I mean me — I mean 
Betty — stood there grinning like 
an ape. 

"Beat you to it, heel," she — he 
said. 

I'd been wrong about the psychic matrix. 

That damned woman had always wanted to wear the trousers. 
Now she was wearing them, the 
ones that should have been mine. 

A little thing like the sex of the 
body I inhabit shouldn't really 
matter, of course. Sex doesn't 
actually apply to me, as such. 
But . . . 

Anybody know where I can get 
some nylons?
