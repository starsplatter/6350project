Katahut Said No By J. T. McINTOSH 

ON Earth a town died. Its name was Katahut. 

But Katahut was on Venus 25 million miles away. 

It was like Koko's story to the 
Mikado. When Economics Center 
said, "Let a thing be done." it 
was as good as done — practically, 
it was done. When EC said a 
town must die, the town was as 
good as dead — practically, it was 
dead — so why not say so? 

At New York EC headquarters, 
thousands of little cards had run 
upright along tiny, shining runways. Each card was a town. The 
machine which shuffled and dealt 
them, sent them on fresh journeys 
on the steel runways, or rejected 
them and shot them back the 
way they had come, was not 
Strictly an electronic brain. It was 
rather a vast filing system, capable of selecting the one relevant 
fact among millions of facts. 
True, an electronic brain was in 
circuit, directing the operation, 
but the brain treated the conclusions "of the selecto? as sacred, 
questioning nothing. "You do 
your job," it told the selector, in 
effect, "and I'll do mine." 

Lights acted on cells across the 
little runways, modified by holes 
or cuts in the cards passing 
through. The selector worked for 
a long time, but wasted none of 
it. The hundreds of cards that 
started were at once decimated. 
Those which remained were run 
again and again, a little more 
being taken into consideration 
each time. Rejection became 
slower and slower. Sometimes the 
thirty or so cards left would complete the run without any being 
eliminated. But the selector always had something else to try. 

When there were eleven cards 
left, each was a perfectly good 
solution to the problem fed to the 
selector. But no one would ever 
know that. No one would ever 
ask. 

The selector had its orders. It 
wasn't a batch of eleven cards 



that was wanted; it was one— one 
card representing a town that best 
fitted EC requirements. The selector, in trouble, applied to the 
electronic brain for guidance. 

The brain pondered unemotionally and came up with the 
answer that, other things being 
equal, it would be best to select 
the town with the smallest population. 

Within four seconds a card was 
shot into a wire basket in the Coordinator's office. He picked it up 
and read the only word printed 
on it — the name of the town. 

"Good God!" he said, aghast. 
"Katahut! Who would have 
thought it?" 

From that moment Katahut 
was as good as dead. 

THE Katahutans heard it on 
the radio, saw it on the television screens, read it in the newspapers, were told about it by their 
neighbors, and then went to the 
city officials to see if it was true. 

The mayor was in a bad position, and no one knew it better 
than he did. On the one hand he 
had lost his office, his town and 
his home and might never be a 
mayor again. On the other, as a 
representative of government and 
law and order, he had to make 
sure that his people understood 
and obeyed the order without obstinacy or defiance. And all he 
had to say to them was what they

knew already. Being a politician, 
he cursed the stupidity of EC for 
not leaving him some tiny crumb 
of reassurance to give. When your 
house is burned to the ground, 
it's nice to learn afterward that 
your wife has had the car out. If 
EC had allowed him to tell his 
people about the compensation 
arrangements, say . 

But they hadn't. They left him 
to say in words of one syllable 
what EC had said in officialese. 

"It is necessary for the economic stability of Venus — " he 
said, then realized he had quoted 
direct from the official notice. He 
went one step higher on the 
pseudo-Greek facade of the city 
hall. The crowd was growing in 
a way he didn't like. He would 
soon be a solitary man shouting 
vainly over the heads of people 
who didn't intend to do anything 
hostile, perhaps, but could relieve 
their feelings by making him look 
silly. 

"Look, people," he said. "They 
aren't evacuating Katahut for 
fun. There would be chaos if they 
left things as they are. Yes, 
chaos!" he exclaimed, forcing himself to warm up. "Costs in colonies are high, because so much 
still has to come from Earth. 
Venus has much of what we need, 
but not enough. There are too 
many small towns on the planet. 
^Too much transport is necessary. 
A careful economic calculation 



has shown that we are one town 
over the critical figure for the 
economic survival of Venus — •* 

"We have heard all that, Robert," said ex-mayor Hank Todd. 

It was more than an interruption. It brought Mayor Henrison 
to a dead stop. Henrison was over 
fifty, but he always felt like a 
small boy before old Hank. He 
couldn't stop Hank from calling 
him Robert. He couldn't even try. 
It would make him look silly, 
particularly since everyone called 
Hank Hank. 

"What have you to say, if anything," Hank asked, "that isn't in 
the EC statement?" 

There was the rub. Henrison 
looked helplessly down at the 
tall, thin old man who had been 
mayor before him and who might 
have had this job instead of him. 
What would Hank have done? 
What Was there for anyone to do? 

Henrison was no shirker. He 
made a valiant try. 

"No, I've nothing new to say," 
he admitted. "But what most of 
you want to know is what the 
EC statement means. You should 
know, Hank. But there must be 
others still wondering. Thinking, 
perhaps, that it isn't really necessary for us all to pack up and 
go somewhere else. That Economic Center is making a mountain out of a molehill, I can tell 
them, at least, that that isn't so. 
Statistics isn't a game any more,

with mathematicians amusing 
themselves by working out how 
far such-and-such would stretch 
if piled end to end, or how many 
times people yawned in their life. 
It's a way of getting a clear warning of trouble ahead. 

"Without statistics we'd have 
gone on developing Venus, until 
gradually we saw there was something wrong with the works, tried 
to correct it and couldn't. We'd 
probably never know that all that 
was wrong was that there was one 
small town too many on the 
planet, and that if we'd evacuate 
it, shut it up and dismantled it, 
the colony would never have 
failed." 

Hank seemed to have appointed himself spokesman. Nobody disputed it. Hank was still 
& good man and he had the right 
kind of experience. He wasn't 
afraid to give a lead, which was 
what everyone wanted — even 
Henrison, if the puzzled, vexed 
people in front of him would only 
realize it. 

"You trust these statistics, 
Robert?" Hank asked. 

"Certainly I do. A doctor gives 
you a drug that may be poison. 
You may even know it's poison. 
You don't know that it'll help 
you to take it. You have to take 
his word for it. I'm no statistician, 
Hank, any more than you are, 
but I'm ready to believe the 
answers." 



"The answers of a mechanical 

brain." 

Henrison knew the value of 
demonstration. He pulled out a 
small calculating machine. He 
pressed the buttons. "Twelve to 
the power of five is 248832," he 
said. "That's not a difficult calculation. You can work it out 
on the back of an envelope in a 
few seconds. And when you do, 
you find it's right. After a bit you 
don't check the answers any 
more. You just check the machine every now and then, which 
the technicians do, of course. I 
think we can trust the answer. 
Hank." 

Hank said nothing, thinking. 
There was suddenly dead silence. 
In the curious emphatic way of 
crowds, everyone knew that a decision would be made and their 
course set in the next few seconds. It might be Hank's way, it 
might be Henrison's, it might be 
something quite different. 

"I think," said Hank quietly, 
"that a town, like an individual, 
has a right to live." 

The crowd cheered that wildly, 
as if it were a long, brilliant and 
impassioned speech. It was the 
first hint that someone thought 
the EC ruling needn't be final. 
No one wanted to be the first to 
suggest that there should be any 
resistance to the ruling. Perhaps 
even Hank himself needed that 
cheer before he took any definite 




 



step or made any" decision. 

Having heard it, he turned and 
faced the crowd. 

"I'm going to the EC depot 
at Cannap," he said. "Anyone 
coming with me?" , 

"W7HY the Coordinator on 
Earth had been aghast when 
the name of Katahut came out 
of the selector was that Katahut 
was perhaps the only small town 
on Venus which he knew by name. 
It had been the first settlement 
on Venus, founded fifty years before. It had not been developed 
much, and it had not grown, because it was only by chance that 
the first ship had landed there. 
Otherwise the site had little to 
commend it. It was not on a 
river. There were no iron or coal 
deposits near by. The soil, for 
Venus, was not particularly good. 
It had been used as a base, no 
more, and the big and important 
towns had sprung up elsewhere. 

Now it wasn't even a base. 
Cannap was the capital, Regis 
the main spaceport, Harun the 
great supply base. Cornfield the 
industrial center. There was no 
economic reason for Katahut to 
exist. So after the first mild shock 
— for the name of Katahut was 
taught in schools — everyone saw 
that the natural choice, if a town 
had to be eliminated, was Katahut. They forgot, perhaps, that 
there were other small towns on 



Venus which served as little purpose as Katahut and had no historical significance. It didn't occur to them that the Katahutans 
had any genuine complaint. Many 
cities on Earth had been evacuated. It was wasteful to let towns 
for which there was no real purpose die a slow and painful economic death. 

Indeed, most people had come 
to accept the benevolent rule of 
Economic Center, which gave 
them more leisure and put more 
money in their pockets to spend, 
to such an extent that it was almost taken for granted that everyone, everywhere, had done the 
same thing. Perhaps EC was a 
little abrupt with Katahut. At 
one time, before such a step was 
taken, there had been cautious, 
psychologically correct preparation. The people in a town to be 
evacuated — all on Earth, so far, 
apart from two on Mars which 
evacuated themselves — were 
shown the advantages of the decision, given plenty of time, 
encouraged for a while to move 
between their old place of residence and the new, and helped 
in every way. 

But that hadn't been necessary 
lately. The redistribution of population was only a tiny part of 
the concerns of EC and didn't get 
much publicity. O^casionnlly, a 
particularly picturesque evacuation would rate an illustrated article in the photographic magazines. The exacuation of a town 
with no economic purpose, as a 
rule, was worth only three or four 
lines in the newspapers which 
didn't cover that area. 

Katahut, of course, would rate 
much more than that, even on 
Mars. Most of the news value of 
the evacuation would be in its 
name and history, some in the 
fact that it was the first Venusian 
town to be affected, with a good 
bit of propaganda because it was 
the only economic adjustment 
necessary on Venus, according to 
the EC survey. 

Later, naturally, it was pointed 
out with heat, irony, amusement 
and cool disdain that one simple 
question to an electronic brain fed 
with ^all the data would have 
shown exactly what would happen. That was the trouble with 
cybernetics. It wasn't merely that 
the data had to be correct and 
complete. It was not enough that 
the right questions should be 
asked. 

All the right questions had to 
be asked. 

And no one thought of asking: 
"Suppose Katahut raises such a 
row that the whole question of 
compulsory evacuation has to be 
reviewed?" 

Others, of course, said an electronic brain wasn't necessary for 
that. Common sense ought to 
have shown EC enough to pre


vent the mistake. 
- Everyone, as usual, was very 
good at shutting the stable door 
after the horse had bolted. 

HANK hadn't been allowed to 
bring anyone in with him. 
The EC chief at Cannap was 
quite prepared to see him, give 
him a drink and have a friendly 
chat, but as Hank was obviously 
the man who mattered in Katahut's mild revolt against EC— 
like a rabbit trying to push a 
ten -ton truck off its front door 
—it would be far better to deal 
with him direct, without giving 
him the advantage of a sympathetic audience. 

"You want to be satisfied that 
this step is necessary, Mr. Todd," 
the EC local chief said. "Very 
natural. It may seem to you, an 
intelligent but untrained man, 
that some other method would 
get the same results, or that the 
selector on Earth didn't know its 
job. 

"What we work for, Mr. Todd, 
is balance. Only a balanced economy can be a healthy economy. 
Now Venusian development is 
held back at the moment by settlements which are moribund but 
refuse to die. Katahut, for example. You may think your town 
pays its way. In a sense it does, 
but only at the expense of the 
rest of Venus. As you know, we 
long ago adopted a policy of 



7# 




 



equalization of freight charges on 
Venus, so that everything you 
buy in Katahut costs exactly 
what it costs anywhere else on 
the planet. I won't go into the 
reasons for this, but we don't have 
to argue about that, do we? Now 
the existence of Katahut — " 

"That," said Hank, "is exactly 
the point. I was wondering when 
you'd get to it." 

The EC chief raised his eyebrows at this rustic bluntness. 

"I didn't want to interrupt," 
said Hank, "but the very first 
step was wrong. I don't want to 
be satisfied that this step is necessary. I'm not going to argue on 
the lines of 'necessary to whom or 
to what?' Suppose you came to 
me and told me my death was 
necessary to the survival of the 
human race. I'd still want to 
live." 

The EC man smiled coldly. 
"This is hardly a question of life 

or death, Mr. Todd." 

"No, it's a question of liberty, 
which is often more important 
than life or death. And don't 
sigh and think 'fanatic' to yourself, either. We've got a nice little 
town which suits me and a lot 
of other people. The soil may not 
grow orchids, but it suits my 
truck garden. We've got a mayor 
who is honest and isn't a fool. 
The preacher says the kind of 
things we like to hear on Sundays. 
We live in a place that we and 



our fathers built. 

"Maybe you can give me another place where I can grow 
vegetables and where there's a 
good mayor and a good preacher. 
But you can't give me Ted Jacob* 
next door and Cuan O'Farrell up 
the street and Bill Houliston on 
the other side of town when I 
want a good argument. Look, Mr. 
EC Chief, suppose all you say is 
true — what do we owe Venus? 
We came here and made our beds 
and you won't let us lie on them. 
We didn't develop away from 
you; you developed away from 
us. That's your funeral, not ours." 

"Mr. Todd, I hope you^re not 
going to say that science — 

But Hank was properly wound 
up by this time. "I'm not going 
to say anything about science and 
neither are you. I don't know 
what you were going to say, but 
it wasn't about science; 'it was 
about gadgetry. A metal brain 
said we had to shift. What has 
that to do with science? The 
brain only said the kind of thing 
you built it to say. You could 
have done the same thing without 
any machines, by making tables 
instead. Read down the columns 
and then across and finally you 
prove that x is equal to x. EC is 
playing with a toy, Mr. EC Chief, 
like a new watch. 

"A watch and an electronic 
brain tell you what you make 
them tell you. Does the brain on

71 



Earth know anything about my 
cucumbers? Does it know Cuan 
O'Farrell? When it does. Til be 
pleased to meet it. Until then, I 
don't see why I should let it run 
my life." 

Hank was entirely wrong and 
the EC chief told him so. But 
Hank had been a local politician 
lor thirty years, so he didn't stay 
on one subject long enough to be 
nailed down. He didn't know exactly what he was trying to do. 
He only knew that whenever 
there was an opening, he would 
try to squeeze through it. 

And suddenly there it was. 

"Of course, if it's the unanimous verdict of the people of 
Katahut that they want to remain 
where they are. as a community 
..." the EC chief hedged at last. 

Hank pounced on it. "Yes? 
what then?" , 

"Why, we might find it possible 
to evacuate another similar town. 
Or make other similar adjustments as indicated by the cybernetics department." 

Hank knew he had no time to 
think. To get the EC chief into 
a corner, he had had to go into 
it himself. He knew — none could 
know better — how difficult it was 
to get a unanimous verdict on 
anything which affected a lot of 
people in many different ways. 
But . . . 

"Right," he said, rising. "I accept your conditions. Without 



reservations. I better leave now.** 
The EC man was put off stroke, 
wondering what conditions he 
had offered. 

When Hank had gone, the chief 
got on the radiophone to Venus 
Space Station I to Earth Space 
Station III to EC headquarters, 
and asked for the Coordinator. 
He was no fool. He told the Coordinator coolly what had happened, knowing that he would 
make a much better impression 
that way than apologizing and 
excusing himself. He did. The 
Coordinator said nothing but, 
"Wait." 

The Cannap chief waited for 
forty-five seconds. Then the Coordinator was back. "The electronic brain says there will be no 
unanimous verdict." 

"Does the electronic brain," 
asked the Cannap chief irrelevantly, "know Hank Todd's cucumbers?" 

It didn't, of course. There was 
no reason why it should. 

NOT in any way was it the 
fault of the electronic brain. 
It had had insufficient data, many 
important things like Hank 
Todd's cucumbers being omitted. 
It didn't know Cuan O'Farrell 
and it didn't know Bill Houliston. 

Curiously enough, Cuan O'Farrell was one of Hank's most obtrusive stumbling-blocks. He not 
only wouldn't sign the roll, he

went round after Hank and old 
Bill persuading people to take 
their names off it. 

"This," Hank told him grimly, 
"has got to stop." 

"I agree," Cuan said cordially. 
"It's a lot of nonsense, and the 
sooner you stop making a fool 
of yourself, the better." 

Hank talked for four hours 
without getting to first base. 
Then suddenly, as he was dozing 
off that night, he came awake 
with a shout, jumped out of bed 
and into his pants. 

Cuan was already asleep and 
was even less prepared, when 
roused, to listen to reason than he 
had been that afternoon. 

"You say," said Hank, "that 
it's no violation of freedom to 
split us up and send us to the 
four corners of Venus?" 

"This afternoon I did," Cuan 
retorted, "and tomorrow I will 
again. Right now I want to sleep." 

"You're a socialist, Cuan." 

"Did you waken me up to tell 
me that? I've been a socialist for 
sixty-five years." 

What Cuan meant by socialism 
was quite different from anything 
ever meant by the word before 
space travel began. But that was 
incidental. 

"Suppose you were mayor, 
Cuan?" 

Cuan came fully awake and 
looked shrewdly at Hank. He was 
suspicious, but interested. 



"I'm not," he pointed out. 

"No, but this is a question of 
liberty and the rights of man. 
Suppose you'd worked on this 
town for the fifty years of its existence and at last got yourself 
elected mayor. If they split up 
the town, all your work on socialism would have been wasted. You 
see that? You'd have to start in 
some other town, fifty years too 
late. Would that be right?" 

Cuan looked at him unblinkingly for a while. Then he said: 
"No, it would not be right. You 
got that petition handy?" 

Next to Cuan, Mary Brookshaw was the most difficult. 
Mary, who was always called 
May, was eighteen and the prettiest girl in Katahut. She was 
leaving anyway. Katahut was 
nothing to her. She saw no reason 
why it shouldn't be evacuated. 

"It's a dull, priggish, half-dead 
little place," she told Hank hotly, 
"full of dull, priggish, half-dead 
little people. It should have been 
broken up long ago. There are 
still people who won't speak to 
me because I once walked down 
the street in a sunsuit, because I 
don't go to church and because I 
wouldn't marry Jim Jacobs. And, 
because I've been out with two or 
three different boys, even people 
who like me call me boy-crazy. 
This is a town where you're guilty 
until you're proved innocent." 

"It's your home, May," Hank 



KATAHUT SAID NO 



7i 



said quietly. "Far more than ours. 
I was born on Earth. You were 
not only born here, your father 
and mother were." 

"They're dead and I'm leaving," said May. "I've had eighteen 
years here and it seems like a 
thousand." 

"The first eighteen are always 
the worst." 

May grinned unwillingly. 
"Don't get me wrong about this, 
Hank," she said. "I like you. You 
were nice to me when I was a 
kid, and no more and no less 
nice to me when I grew up. If 
you'd had a son or maybe a 
grandson, I guess I could have 
gone for him and I might have 
been your daughter-in-law or 
granddaughter-in-law. If it was 
just *%i personal thing, I'd sign 
your petition like a shot. But 
what I feel is that everyone who 
signs that sheet of yours has to 
feel this town's worth saving, and 
I don't." 

Hank recognized defeat and 
left her alone. Perhaps, since she 
was leaving, the EC men wouldn't 
think the absence of her name 
on the list kept the verdict from 
being unanimous. 

Later on, when it began to look 
as if, after all, there was a chance 
of getting the unanimous verdict, 
Hank wasn't so happy about 
May's refusal to sign the petition. 

Then she walked in shamefacedly and signed. "People have 



been so decent lately,** she complained. "Did you put them up 
to it? No, I suppose you wouldn't 
You're too straight. Presentations, 
good-luck tokens, everybody saying they were sorry I was going 
and they hoped I'd be back some 
time. Then I realized there 
wouldn't be anywhere to come 
back to. Maybe the fact that 
there are two generations of 
Henshaws buried in the churchyard means something after all. 
They didn't live long, did they?" 

Hank was very tender with her. 
He knew somehow that she 
wouldn't live long either. Whatever anyone said about the Henshaws, nobody could accuse them 
of being lucky. 

YOUNG Tom Hollins, unlike 
Cuan and May, wasn't difficult at all. He just wouldn't sign. 

Tom was a tall, good-looking 
young fellow — the right type for 
May, one would have thought. 
But they had bounced apart in 
childhood somehow, and never got 
together again. Tom didn't often 
argue, but when he- was sure he 
was right about something, there 
was no shaking him. 

"You see yourself as a crusader," he told Hank. "On one 
side the cold, feelingless machine, 
on the other the old man championing the little people." 

"If you say so, Tom," said 
Hank agreeably.

Tom grinned. "You're good at 
it. of course," he admitted. 
"You've done wonders already. 
But you're all wrong. This isn't 
a battle between men and machines." 

"Just what I've been saying all 
along," said Hank. "I've got 
nothing again electronic brains. 
They do their job. All I say is 
we shouldn't be shifted i f we 
don't want to shift." 

"No force? No coercion?" 

"That's right." 

"Well, I hope you'll be consistent and not try to coerce me 
into signing your protest." 

"You think the machine is 
right?" 

"Yes." 

"You want the machine to be 
right?" 

"Sure I do. Why not?" 

"You'd rather a mechanical 
brain was right than a human 
one?" 

"Hank, no doubt you could argue the hind leg off a horse, but 
you're not going to get the chance 
to argue the hind leg off me. I'll 
come around and help you to 
collect signatures if you like, but 
I won't sign." 

"That's a curious attitude." 

"Could be. It's simple enough 
If you put it this way — I'll help 
you because I like you, but I 
won't sign the roll because I don't 
think it's right. See?" 

About that time the EC chief 



from Cannap came to visit Katahut. Hank welcomed him gravely, 
but with inward glee. The EC 
man was worried. He had heard 
how the protest was going. 

He told Hank: "I hear most 
of the people in town think as 
you do, Mr. Todd." 

"It's beginning to look that 
way." 

"Of course, this petition isn't 
official, you understand. You are 
the prime mover in this appeal, 
and though I understand you 
once were mayor of the town, you 
no longer hold . . . *' 

Hank cut that short. "Mayor 
Henrison was one of the first to 
sign. Want him to make it official?" 

fTTHE EC chief was ready to try 
anything, apparently. He had 
made several other objections, 
none of which cut any ice, and he 
seemed to know it. 

At last he said: "Mr. Todd, 
I'll be frank with you. I had no 
authority to suggest that a unanimous protest would make us 
change our minds over the evacuation of Katahut. In fact, I 
didn't. You grabbed the idea and 
left before I could explain." 

"You're going back on your 
word, you mean," said Hank affably. 

"Not exactly ..." 

"Approximately is near enough. 
When do the troops move in?" 



KATAHUT SAID NO 



7$ 



rpHE EC chief was startled. 

Hank was a jump ahead of 
him. "Your obvious plan," re*marked Hank, "is to get me on 
incitement to violence. It won't 
be easy. I'm past the age of violence myself, and I haven't said 
any more to anyone than that 
they should stay put." 

"Mr. Todd, you have shown 
yourself a very capable man. EC 
needs men like you. Age doesn't 
matter, for it doesn't seem to 
bother you. I — " 

"That may be the best approach," Hank said thoughtfully, 
nodding. "If you want me to kick 
; on irto the street, all you have 
ti ("o is cone right out with it 
a" r to bribe me." 

Vi-e EC chief groped for words. 
"I m'ish you would und rstand. 
It's a simple question of necessity. We must evacuate one of 
these small uneconomic towns. 
It's all very well for you to say, 
'Why Katahut?' But if Katahut 
gets away with this, do you think 
any other small town will submit? 
No, they'll say, "You didn't evacuate Katahut, so why come to 
us?" 

"And quite right t*o. Towns 
have a right to live, just like 
ir-di-'ir'nals." 

"Cut now v/c can det'-'-m^e the 
■ r\ Sal factors - ad the an 1 er for 
"nt ' i-t dz-r- 'i c- o"-t right,

■iero here and nu.v, but in a hun


dred years or less you'll be cursed 
as the reactionary who brought 
the whole Venusian colony down 
in ruins." 

"Oh, come now. You may have 
an electronic brain that can tell 
you how long to roast meat and 
whether it will rain on Tuesday, 
but not whether a town should 
die. There must be some other 
way." 

"There's no other way!" the 
EC chief protested. "Some day 
we may have a civilization that 
isn't built on economics, but we 
haven't got it now. Before cybernetics, things just took their 
course. Tqey went wrong or ri^ht. 
If they went wrong, it was often 
possible to say later that it was 
at one precise point that the mistake wjt.s made. Cybernetics tells 
us now where the mistake is, so 
that we don't need to make it. 
The whole future of the human 
race — " 

"Now let's not lose our sense 
of proportion," said Hank gently. 
"All we're talk*"^ about, at most, 
is the future of the colony of 
Venus." 

"All right, the whole future of 
the colony of Venus han^s on 
just this one little thing." 

"But we don't tlurifc it's a l ; ttle 
thing. We think it's a ver- big 
thing. Ask your machine :omc 
other questions. "'■11 it the first 
•solution is no good, because II <tahut says no."

The EC chief went away. The 
next day was the original date 
set for the evacuation of Katahut. He said he'd be back. Hank 
didn't doubt it. Neither did Tom 
Hollins, who had been a witness 
at the interview. 

"Maybe I should argue," said 
Tom, "Not to let you convince 
me that I should sign the roll, 
but to try to ' convince you that 
you should give up the whole idea 
and let them evacuate Katahut." 

"Maybe you should," agreed 
Hank. "Wouldn't do a bit of 
good. My cucumbers are coming 
along fine. So is the petition, for 
what it's worth. You know, you're 
the only one who hasn't signed 
it, Tom. How about making it 
unanimous?" 

Tom shook his head, grinning. 

"W7HEN the EC chief came 
" back the next morning, he 
brought a hundred Cannap police 
officers and fifty trucks with him. 
Hank surveyed them grimly. On 
his right, Cuan O'Farrell stroked 
his chin thoughtfully. On his left, 
Tom HolHns raised his eyebrows 
as the police quietly dispersed 
through the small town. 

"The petition," said the EC 
chief, flanked by two uniformed 
officers. "Is it unanimous?" 

"Not quite," said Hank. 

"Then ..." 

"Wait a bit," murmured Tom 
Hollins. "What are these men 



here for? And all those trucks?' 

"There may be a little trouble 
We want to be ready for it. If the 
petition had been unanimous, of 
course, we might ..." 

"It looks to me," said Tom, 
"as if the fact that the petition 
isn't unanimous is only an excuse. 
You didn't wait to get the answer 
before you sent your men to do 
whatever it is they are doing. And 
you didn't bring all those trucks 
for nothing. Let's try something, 
shall we? Hank, where do I sign?" 

"I think you're right,"* Hank 
remarked. "It doesn't make any 
difference. The petition is complete, Mr. EC Chief. The nex' 
move is up to you." 

"I'm sorry. We hoped yoi 
would fail. It would have made 
it easier. But as I tpld you yesterday, the petition can't be allowed to make any difference. 
This is too important." 

They heard a girl's scream 
and May Henshaw appeared, 
thrown over the shoulder of a 
policeman, but still kicking and 
struggling. 

"From my previous experience 
of May," said Tom, "I'm surprised that one man can handle 
her. We'll see what — " 

Hank held him back. "I think 
May will manage," he said. 

He was right. When May wa. 
dropped to her feet, she deal, 
with her captor with extreme efficiency. Tom applauded loudly. 



KATAHUT SAID NO

"Now if she'd been as ugly as 
sin," he remarked, "she'd never 
have learned that. It's rather sad, 
but girls as pretty as May can 
usually look after themselves." 

He had spoken casually. Cuan 
and Hank were old. He wasn't. 
He swung at the EC chief and 
the chief felt it. Whether his nose 
was broken remained to be seen. 
It was certainly badly bent. 

The population of Katahut was 
eight hundred and twenty-three. 
There were a hundred policemen. 
That meant 8.23 Katahutans for 
every cop. And the cops had orders not to be unduly violent. 
People like Tom Hollins were 

7« 



under no such disadvantages. 

It was a comic battle. It isn't 
funny when the weak are hurt, 
but in the battle of Katahut the 
only people who were hurt were 
cops, and that's always funny. 
Hank moved around under the 
capable protection of Tom and 
May, making sure that no serious 
damage was done. It was better 
to tear the pants off the policeman than hit them over the head. 
Without pants they could still 
move, and all the movement was 
out of Katahut. 

A man isn't necessarily a coward when he runs from a woman. 
More policemen ran from May 


 



than from Tom. In fact, there was 
a brief period when Tom, in difficulties, was very glad of May's 
help and protection. 

But May, after all, only had 
120 pounds or so at her command. Some of the other women 
had nearly twice that. Muscle, 
too, not the soft flesh of Earthbound housewives and secretaries. 
They could hoe a row or chop a 
tree with any man — or poke a 
jaw, for that matter. 

When one of the policemen got 
a truck going, there was a wild 
rush to climb aboard. The truck 
wobbled off in the general direction of Cannap, with nearly forty 



cops clinging to it — and hardly 
half a dozen whole pairs of pants. 

In an hour there wasn't a cop 
left in Katahut except the two 
local policemen, who darted home 
to get out of uniform in case 
anyone should make a mistake. 

TTANK and Cuan and Tom and 
Bill and May, breathless 
but content, looked down the 
dusty road. 

"Will they come back?" Cuan 
asked. 

Hank pondered. "I don't think 
so. There would be too much 
public feeling now. They may 
put me in jail for a month or two, 
but I don't think they'll do even 
that. I was careful not to raise 
a hand in anger. You'd better 
keep out of the way, Tom. I 
don't think it matters for you, 
May, They can't put you in jail 
for knocking out policemen. It 
would make them look silly." 

"Then it's over?" said Cuan, 
apparently troubled by a feeling 
of anti-climax. 

"I think so. They'll try another 
small town now. It will tell them, 
quite rightly, to go to hell. I 
think we've won our case." 

They had. EC couldn't keep a 
hundred cops quiet — men who, 
despite everything, were more in 
sympathy with the Katahutans 
than not. And a dozen Katahutans 
told the story, with glee, to any 
newspaperman who cared to ask 
for it. It made good copy. There 
was hardly a newspaper on 
Venus, Earth or Mars that didn't 
run cartoons on the Battle of 
Katahut — or, as someone christened it, the Battle of Sans Culottes. Everyone laughed and 
thought it was a good story. 

Hardly anyone paid any attention to the serious articles in 
the same papers pointing out that 
Katahut's fight for life was all 
very well, but if the electronic 
brain said this meant economic 
chaos in Venus, it was probably 
right. 

It was right, of course.
