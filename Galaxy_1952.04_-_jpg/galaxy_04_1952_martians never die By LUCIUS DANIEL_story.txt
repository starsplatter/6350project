martians never die By LUCIUS DANIEL 


AT three-fifteen, a young man 
walked into the circular brick building and took 
a flattened package of cigarettes 
from his shirt pocket. 

"Mr. Stern?" he asked, throwing away the empty package. 

Stern looked with hard eyes at 
the youthful reporter. He recognized the type. 

"So they're sending around 
cubs now," he said. 

"I'm no cub — I've been on the 
paper a whole year," the reporter 
protested, and then stopped, 
realizing his annoyance had 
betrayed him. 

"Only a year. The first time 
they sent their best man." 

"This ain't the first time," said 
the young man, assuming a bored 
look. "It's the fourth time, and 
next year I don't think anybody 
will come at all. Why should 
they?" 

"Why, because they might be 
able to make it," Beryl spoke up. 
"Something must have happened 
before." 

Stern watched the reporter

drink in BeryTs loveliness. 

"Well, Mrs. Curtis," the young 
man said, "everyone has it figured 
out that Dr. Curtis got stuck in 
the fourth dimension, or else lost, 
or died, maybe. Even Einstein 
can't work out the stellar currents 
your husband was depending on." 

" I t's very simple ," replied 
Beryl, "but I can't explain it intelligibly. I wish you could have 
talked to Dr. Curtis." 

"Why is it that we have to 
come out here just once a year to 
wait for him? Is that how the 
fourth dimension works?" 

"It's the only time when the 
stellar currents permit the trip 
back to Earth. And it's nor the 
fourth dimension! Clyde was always^ irritated when anyone 
would talk about his traveling to 
Mars in the fourth dimension." 

"It's interdimensional," Stern 
put in. 

"And you're his broker?" asked 
the reporter, throwing his cigarette down on the brick floor and 
stepping on it. "You're his old 
friend from college days, handled 
his financial affairs, and helped 
him raise enough money to build 
his machine?" 

"Yes," Stern replied, a little 
pompously. "It was through my 
efforts that several wealthy men 
took an interest in the machine, 
so that Dr. Curtis did not have to 
bear the entire expense himself." 

"Yeah, yeah," the reporter 



sighed. "I read an old story on 
it before I came here. Now I'm 
out of cigarettes." He looked 
hopefully at Stern. 

Stern returned the look coldly. 
"There's a store where you can 
buy some about three blocks 
down the road." 

"Is that the room where he's 
expected to materialize with his 
machine?" The reporter pointed 
to an inner door. 

"Yes. Dr. Curtis wanted to be 
sure no one would be injured. 
This inner circular room was 
built first; then he had the outer 
wall put up as an added precaution. The circular passageway 
we're in leads all around the old 
room, but this doorway is the 
only entrance." 

"And what are those holes in 
the top of the door for?" 

"If he returns, we can tell by 
the displaced air rushing out. 
Then the door will open automatically." 

"And when is the return scheduled for?" asked the reporter. 

"Three -forty -seven and twenty-nine seconds." 

"If it happens," the reporter 
added skeptically. "And if it 
doesn't, wc have to wait another 
year." 

"Optimum conditions occur 
just once a year." 

"Well, I'm going out to get 
some cigarettes. I've got time . . . 
and probably nothing to wait 



106 




 



for, I'll return though." 

He walked briskly through the 
outer door. 

'TTVHIS is the hardest part of 
the year, especially now. 
Suppose he did come back," 
Beryl said plaintively. 

"You don't have to worry," 
Stern assured her. "Clyde himself 
said that if he didn't come back 
the second year, he might not 
make it at all." Stern opened his 
gold case now and offered Beryl 
a cigarette. 

She shook her head. "But he 
made two trial runs in it first and 
came back." 

"That was for a short distance 
only — that is, a short distance 
astronomically. Figuring for 
Mars was another story. Maybe 
he missed the planet and . . ." 

"Oh, don't! It's just not knowing that I can't stand." 

"Well," he said drily, "we'll 
know in — " he stopped ' and 
looked at his wristwatch — "in 
just about fifteen minutes." 

"I can't watt," she moaned. 

He put his arm around her. 
"Relax. Take it easy and stop 
worrying. It'll just be like last 
time." 

"Not the last time at all. We 
hadn't — " 

"As soon as we are able to 
leave here," he said, drawing her 
close and squeezing her gently, 
"I'll take steps to have him de


clared legally dead. Then we'll 
get married." 

"That's not much of a proposal," she smiled. "But I guess 
I'll have to accept you. You have 
Clyde's power of attorney." 

"And we'll be rich. Richer than 
ever. I'll be able to use some of 
my own ideas about the investments. As a matter of fact, I 
have already." And he frowned 
slightly. 

"We have enough," Beryl said 
quickly. "Don't try to speculate. 
You know how Clyde felt about 
that." 

"But he spent so damned much 
on the machine. I had to make 
back those expenses -Somehow." 

Steps sounded outside and they 
drew apart. The reporter came in 
with a companion of about his 
own age. 

"Better wipe the lipstick off," 
he grinned. "It's almost time for 
something to happen." 

Stern dabbed at his mouth angrily with his handkerchief. 

At first the sound was so soft 
that it could hardly be heard, but 
soon a whistling grew until it 
became a threat to the eardrums. 
The reporters looked at each 
other with glad, excited eyes. 

The whistling stopped abruptly 
and, slowly, the door opened. The 
reporters rushed in immediately. 

Beryl gripped Stem's hand convulsively. "He's come back."* 

"Yes, but that mustn't change

our plans, Beryl dear." 

"But, AI . . . Oh, why were we 
so foolish?" 

"Not foolish, dear. Not at all 
foolish. Now we have to go in." 

Inside the room was the large 
sphere of metalloy. It had lost its 
original gleam and was stained 
and battered, standing silent, 
closed, enigmatic. 

"Where's the door?" called the 
first reporter. 

The sphere rested on a number 
of metal stilts, reaching out from 
the lower hemisphere, which held 
it about three feet from the floor, 
like a great pincushion turned 
upside down. 

Slowly, a round section of the 
sphere's wall swung outward and 
steps^Iescended. As they touched 
the floor, both reporters, caught 
by the same idea, sprinted for it 
and fought to see which would 
climb it first. 

"Wait!" shouted Stern. 

The reporters stopped their 
scuffling and followed Stern's 
gaze. 

SOMETHING old and leathery 
and horrible was emerging 
from the circular doorway. Several tentacles, like so many 
snakes, slid around the hand rail 
which ran down the steps. Then, 
at the top, it paused. 

Stern felt an immediate and 
unreasoning hate for the thing, 
whatever it was, a hate so strong 



that he forgot to feel fear. It 
seemed to him to combine the 
repulsive qualities of a spider and 
a toad. The body, fat and repugnant, was covered by a loose 
skin, dull and leathery, and the 
fatness seemed to be pulled downward below the lower tentacles 
like an insect's body, until it was 
wider at the bottom than at the 
top. 

Like a salt shaker, Stern 
thought. 

It turned its head — it had no 
neck; the loose skin of the body 
just turned with it — and looked 
back inside the sphere. The head 
resembled a toad's, but a long 
trident tongue slid in and out 
quickly, changing the resemblance to that of a malformed 
snake. 

From the interior, Dr. Curtis 
appeared beside the creature and 
stood there vaguely for a moment. 
Stern noticed that his clothes 
seemed just as new as when he 
had left, but he had grown a 
long, untrimmcd beard, and his 
face had a vacant expression, as 
if he were hypnotized. 

The creature looked upward at 
Curtis, who was head and shoulders taller, and its resemblance 
changed again in Stern's mind, 
so that now it looked like a dog, 
at least in attitude. From its 
mouth came a low hissing noise. 

Curtis looked down at the dogspider-toad, his eyes slowly be



 




MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



ginning to focus. The creature 
wiggled like a seal with a fish in 
sight, then slid and bumped down 
the steps, with Curtis following 
him. 

"Clyde!" cried Beryl and 
rushed toward Curtis. 

The outstretched tentacles of 
the beast stopped her, but at a 
touch from Curtis they fell away 
and Beryl was in his arms. 

Stern watched the scene sourly 
and with rage in his heart. Why 
hadn't Clyde waited another 
year? Then nothing could have 
changed things. Now he would 
lose not only Beryl, but the management of the money that was 
left, and the marketing of new 
patents on the machine. Curtis 
did not approve of speculation, 
especially when it lost money. 

"You've changed, Clyde," Beryl 
was saying as she hugged him. 
"What is the matter — do you 
need a doctor?" 

"No. I don't want a doctor, but 
I have to get home," said Curtis. 

Stern felt anger again beating 
in his brain like heavy surf on a 
beach. Curtis was sick. The least 
he could have done was die. Well, 
maybe he still would. And if he 
didn't he could be helped to — 
Stern saw the beast looking at 
him intently, malevolently. Its 
face might have looked almost 
human, now that it was so close, 
if it had possessed eyebrows and 
hair. As it was, its nose rose 



abruptly and flared into two 
really enormous nostrils, but its 
mouth looked small and wrinkled, 
like that of an old grandmother 
without any teeth. 

They turned to the doorway 
without noticing the absence of 
the reporters, who had long since 
run off to telephone and get 
photographers. 

Curtis walked slowly. He would 
stop for a moment, look about as 
if expecting something entirely 
different, and then he would move 
forward again. 

They all got into the car, Curtis and Beryl on the front seat, 
with Beryl driving, and Stern and 
the creature in the rear. As Beryl 
drove, Stern looked savagely at 
the back of Curtis's head, but he 
felt the beast staring at him balefully. Could it be a mind reader? 
That was ridiculous. How could 
anything that couldn't speak read 
a person's mind? 

He turned to study it. The 
Martian, if that was what it was, 
had only six tentacles, three on 
each side. The lower ones were 
heavy and almost as thick as legs. 
The upper ones were small and 
were obviously used as hands, 
while it was possible that the 
middle ones could be used either 
way. A series of suction cups or 
sucking pads were at the end of 
each tentacle. With equipment like 
this, it could walk right up the 
side of a building, except, per


il I 




 



haps, for the higher gravity of 
Earth. 

Stern could smell it now, a dry, 
desert smell, and that made it 
more revolting than ever. They 
were born to hate each other. 

WHEN they got home, Beryl 
was all solicitousness. The 
way a woman is when she has a 
man to impress, Stern thought. 

"Just sit right here in your old 
chair," she told Curtis, "and I'll 
call a doctor. Then I'll put some 
water on to heat." But first she 
knelt by his side and laid her 
head on his breast. "Oh, darling," 
she said with a sob, "Why did 
you wait so long? I've missed you 
so." 

A very good act, Stern told 
himself bitterly, without believing 
it at all. 

She got up and turned toward 
Stern. "Will you help me get 
some water on, Al?" she asked. 
"I'm going to phone." 

He went into the kitchen. He 
knew where the kettle was, the 
refrigerator, the mixings. He 
could hear her dialing, and then, 
before he got the kettle on the 
burner, she came inside and 
closed the kitchen door. 

"Clyde's sick and I have to 
take care of him," she said 
anxiously. 

It wasn't entirely the money, 
he confessed to himself now. He 
hated the situation, but he had 



to give in — on the surface anyway. 

"Okay, let's forget the whole 
thing," he said. 

"Oh, Al dear, I knew you'd understand! I've got to go back now 
and try the phone again. I got a 
busy signal." 

Stern followed her, still rankling at the way Curtis had 
forced Beryl to live while he spent 
so generously on his own expensive interests. Shortly after their 
marriage, he had built a home 
for Beryl and himself in an exclusive suburb, on a hilly bit 
of land with a deep ravine at the 
back. But it was small and Beryl 
had not even been allowed maids 
except when they entertained, 
which was seldom. Soon he would 
change all that, Stern told himself. They had not dared to while 
Clyde was away. 

In the modern living room, 
Curtis sprawled in his easy chair 
as though he hadn't moved since 
they had placed him there. But 
his air of abstraction seemed to 
have increased. Before him sat 
the beast, looking, Stern thought, 
more like a dog than ever. Its 
head wasn't cocked to one side, 
but that, less than its alien appearance, was the one thing to 
spoil the illusion. 

Tires screeched in the driveway 
while Beryl was still at the telephone. Stern went to the front 
door, closed it and put the chain 



MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



bolt in place. The back door 
would still be locked and they 
would hardly try to force the 
screen windows. 

Heavy steps pounded up the 
front walk. "Did Dr. Curtis really 
get back?" The first man shot out. 
The one who followed had a 
camera. 

"Dr. Curtis has returned,'* 
Stern spoke through the opening 
of the front door which the chain 
permitted, "but his physical condition won't permit questioning, 
at least until his doctor has seen 
him." 

"Did he really bring back a 
Ma rt ia n ? We wa nt to see the 
Martian anyway." 

"We can't have Dr. Curtis disturbed in any way until after his 
physician has examined him," 
Stern said bluntly. 

"Is he in there?" 

"We'll give you a report when 
we're ready." 

A SECOND car pulled up to 

the house as Stern shut the 
front door and went to check the 
rear one. When he came back, 
flashes from the window showed 
the cameraman was trying to take 
pictures through the glass. Stern 
drew the shades. 

"Well, poor Schaughtowl, so 
you had to come with me," Curtis was saying to the monster. 

The beast wiggled again as it 
had on the steps of the machine. 



A tail to wag wasn't really necessary, Stern decided, when there 
was so much body to wiggle. 

Schaughtowl, as Curtis addressed it, seemed to brighten in 
the darkened room. 

"Poor, dear Schaughtowl," said 
Curtis gently. 

It was unmistakable now — the 
skin actually brightened and 
emitted a sort of eerie, luminous 
glow. 

Curtis leaned over and put his 
hand on what would have been 
Schaughtowl's neck. The loose 
skin writhed joyously, and, snakeHke, the whole body responded in 
rippling waves of emotion. 

"Gull Lup," the monster — said 
wasn't the right word, but it was 
not a bark, growl, mew, cheep, 
squawk or snarl. Gulp was as 
close as Stern could come, a dry 
and almost painful gulping noise 
that expressed devotion in some 
totally foreign way that Stern 
found revolting. 

He realized that the phone had 
been ringing for some time. He 
disconnected it, and then heard 
loud knocking. 

"It's Dr. Anderson," he heard a 
man's voice calling impatiently 
and angrily. 

Cautiously, Stern opened the 
door, but his care was needless. 
With a few testy remarks, the 
doctor quickly cleared a space 
about the door and entered. 

He went at once to Curtis, with 



112 




 



only a single shocked glance at 
Shnuzhtowl. 

"Where the devil have you been 
and where in hell did you get that 
thing?" he asked as he unbuttoned Curtis's coat and shirt. 

Since playing with his pet, Curtis seemed more awake. "I went 
to Mars," he said. "They're incredibly advanced in ways we 
hardly guess. We're entirely off 
the track. I just came back to 
explain how." 

"Your friend doesn't look very 
intelligent," the doctor answered, 
busy with his stethoscope. 

"Animals like Schaughtowl are 
used for steeds or pets." said Curtis. "The Ladonai are pretty much 
like mankind, only smaller." 

"Why did you stay so long?" 

"After I left, the Ladonai told 
mc. they were going to shut off 
any possible communication with 
£arth until we advance more. 
They think we're at a very dangerous animal-like stage of development. Once I came home, 
I knew 1 couldn't go back, so I 
wanted to learn as much as I 
could before I left them." 

"Stand up for a minute," ordered the doctor. 

"Not right now," said Curtis. 
"I'm too tired." 

"You'd better get to bed, then." 

"I think not. It's merely caused 
by the difference in gravity and 
heavier air. The Ladanoi told me 
to expect it. but not to lie down. 



After a while I'll try to take a 

short walk." 

SO Clyde wasn't going to die, 
after all. Stern thought. He 
had come home with a message, 
and, remembering the determination of the man. Stern knew he 
wouldn't die until he had given it. 
But he had to die. He would die, 
and who was competent enough 
to know that it wasn't from the 
shock of having come home to 
denser air and a heavier gravity? 

There were ways — an oxygen 
tube, for example. Pure oxygen 
to be inhaled in his sleep by lungs 
accustomed to a rarified atmosphere, or stimulants in his food 
so it would look like a little too 
much exertion on a heart already 
overtaxed. There were ways. 

Stern's scalp tingled unpleasantly, and he saw the Mnrtian 
looking at him intently, coldly. 
In that moment Stern knew without question that his mind was 
being read. Not his idea, perhaps, but his intent toward Curtis. The Martian would have to 
be attended to first. 

"Is it true. Dr. Anderson? Will 
he be all right?" Beryl was sitting 
on the arm of the chair next to 
Schaughtowl, and she was looking at Clyde almost as adoringly 
as the Martian. A few hours had 
undone all that Stern had managed to do in four years. 

If Stern had been uncertain, 



MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



113 



that alone would have decided 
him. 

"I think^so," said the doctor. 
"He seems to be uncomfortable, 
rather than in pain. I'll send you 
a prescription for his heart, if he 
breathes too heavily. Be sure, 
though, not to give him more 
than one pill in three hours." 

"Of course." Beryl was never 
that solicitous toward Stern. 

"And you'll be in quarantine 
here until the government decides 
what, if any, diseases he and the 
Martian may have brought back 
with them." 

"None at all, Doctor." Curtis* s 
Voice was markedly mote slurred, 
and he stared intently with unblinking eyes at the blank wall. 
* "Well, that's something we 
Can't tell yet. We'll have to keep 
©ut the press and television men, 
anyway, because of your health. 
If I'm not detained, I'll be back 
tomorrow morning. Call me if 
there's any change." 

On his way out, the physician 
was besieged by reporters and 
photographers, baulked of better 
subjects. Shortly after the doctor's departure, police sirens came 
screaming up. The men waiting 
around the house were moved 
outside the gate and a guard was 
set at every entrance. 

LATER, a messenger came, was 
interrogated by the police 
sergeant who took a small pack


age from him and brought it to 
the house. 

"Medicine," the sergeant said, 
handing it gingerly to Stern. "You 
can't leave here without permission." And he walked hurriedly 
away. 

This might be the answer. Stern 
had a good idea of what the doctor had prescribed — something 
he'd said, for the heart. It must 
have been pretty powerful, too, 
for the doctor to warn against an 
overdose. Two at once might do 
it or another two a little later. 

But there was Schaughtowl. 

"Al," said Beryl, "stay with 
Clyde while I fix something for 
htm to eat." 

She was more beautiful than 
ever. Emotions, he thought wryly, 
become a woman; they thrive on 
them. In a few minutes a woman 
could change like this. It was 
enough to make a man lose faith 
in the sex. 

"Certainly," he said easily. 

Curtis seemed to sleep with 
wide open eyes gazing blankly 
at the far wall. Schaughtowl sat 
motionless before him, watchful 
as a dog, yet still like a snake or 
spider- patiently waiting. Didn't 
the beast ever sleep? 

A drink was what Stern needed. 
He went to the closet and poured 
a double brandy. He sipped it 
slowly. As delicious fire ran down 
his gullet and warmed his stomach, he felt his tension ease and 



114 




 



a sense of confidence pervade his 
mind. 

He needn't worry. He was always successful, except that once 
with the stocks. And he had calm 
nerves. 

There were guards out in front 
now in khaki uniform ; the Governor must have called out a 
company of the National Guard. 
Stern noticed some state police, 
too. The house was well guarded 
on the three sides surrounded by 
a neat, white picket fence. In the 
back, the severe drop into the ravine made guards there unnecessary. 

It was dark before Dr. Curtis 
moved. Beryl was watching him; 
she had little to say to Stern 
now. 

"How about some broth, dear?" 
she asked Curtis immediately. 

Slowly, Clyde's eyes focused on 
her. He smiled. "Let's try it." 

He let Beryl feed him, sitting 
on a stool beside his chair and 
being unnecessarily motherly and 
coddling about it. 

For a while after he had eaten, 
Clyde sat in his chair, looking at 
Beryl with his new and oddly 
gentle smile. It seemed to activate some hidden response in her, 
for she glowed with tenderness. 

"I suppose," Curtis slurred, "I 
ought to try to walk now." 

"Let me help." Stern rose and 
crossed the room. 

The Martian rustled like snakes 



in the weeds, and hissed. 

Beryl said without suspicion, 
"Thank you, Al. I knew you'd do 
whatever you could for Clyde." 
And she rested her hand trustingly on his arm. 

What was past was past, not to 
be wept over, not to be regretted. 

"Like to walk out in the back 
for the air?" Stern asked. "The 
breeze fs coming from that direction." 

"That will do very well," said 
Curtis, obviously not caring a bit. 

STERN helped Curtis from his 
chair and supported him under the arm. They went out the 
back door, the Martian slithering 
after them. It was cooler in the 
garden. Stern felt a renewed surge 
of self-confidence. 

"The stars — " Curtis stopped 
to look upward. 

The night was almost cloudless 
and there was no Moon. The 
house hid any view of the crowds 
and the guards holding them 
back. They were atone in the 
dark. 

Curtis started forward again, 
with the Martian scraping along 
behind. It would never let Curtis 
out of its sight as long as it lived; 
that much was clear to Stern. 

He guided Curtis to a seat close 
to the ravine, a favorite spot. Always the Martian was a step — or 
a slither — behind, and when Curtis sat down, Schaughtowl sat be


MARTIANS NEVER DIE 



115 



tween his beloved master and the 
precipitous drop. 

Stern picked up a rock from 
the rock garden and tossed it 
into the ravine. The Martian did 
not take his eyes off Curtis. Stern 
picked up a larger rock, a sharp, 
pointed one. He was behind the 
Martian and Curtis was looking 
away unseeingly into the night. 

It was simple, really, and well 
executed. The beast's skull bashed 
in easily, being merely thin bones 
for a thin atmosphere and light 
gravitation. A push sent it over 
the edge of the ravine. 

Curtis sat unnoticing, and the 
traffic jam out front created more 
than enough confusion to drown 
out any noise from the creature's 
fall. * 

Stern's palm stung. He realized 
that, before the Martian had 
pitched over the ravine, a suction 
pad had for a moment caught at 
his hand. It had done the beast 
no good, though. 

Curiously, the Martian had not 
guarded itself, only Curtis. Sitting with its back to Stern had 
really invited attack. The mindreading ability was just something that Stern had nervously 
imagined. 

The police would not be able 
to tell his rock from any other. 
The heavy body, its ungainly 
movement and thin bones would 
explain everything. Besides, there 
was no motive for killing the 



Martian and what penalty could 
there be? It couldn't be called 
murder. 

Stern looked at the palm of his 
right hand, the one that had held 
the rock. It stung a little, but in 
the darkness he couldn't see it. 
A stinger of some kind, like a 
bee, probably. The hell with it — 
couldn't be fatal or Curtis would 
have warned them about it. 

The Martian had been walking 
by the ravine and had clumsily 
fallen in. He would report it after 
he had got Curtis back into the 
house. 

Curtis was easy to arouse and 
didn't seem to miss Schaughtowl. 
Stern maneuvered him to the living room, where he sank into a 
ehair and fell into his mood of 
abstraction. 

Beryl must be in the kitchen 
cleaning up, Stern supposed. Perhaps he had better put some kind 
of germicide on his palm, just to 
ward off infection. 

TTE looked at Curtis relaxed in 
the chair. Clyde suddenly appeared oddly boyish to him, 
hardly different than he had 
been in college days. For a moment, Stern felt again the adolescent admiration and fellowship 
he had felt so strongly then. Don't 
be stupid, he told himself angrily. 
This man had the monty and 
the woman that had almost belonged to him. 




 



-»|-OVING slowly, Stern deli1TJ. c iously savored the aroma of 
his triumph. On the table was the 
bottle. Clyde would be easy, unsuspecting, kindlyIt wouldn't be safe to marry 
Beryl right away, but there could 
never be any suspicion. 

No need to hurry. For a moment he wanted to watch Curtis. 
He wondered what kind of pictures Clyde was seeing on the 
blank wall. Martian landscapes? 
The strange Ladonais? Too bad 
he hadn't stayed on Mars. Stern 
couldn't help having a friendly 
feeling for his old college chum, 
pity, too, for what must happen 
to him soon. 

This was no way to kill anyone! 

He was growing old and soft! 

Nevertheless, Curtis did have a 
noble and striking face. Funny 
he had never noticed it before. 
It seemed to glow with an uncanny peace. 

Unnoticed, the numbness crept 
from Stern's palm along his right 
arm, and a prickly sensation appeared in his right leg. 

It was funny to read a person's 
thoughts like this. Love flowed 
from Curtis like the warm glow 
from a burning candle. A sort 
of halo had formed from the light 
above his head. 

Symbolic. 

From Curtis came wave after 
wave of love. He could feel it 



pulsating toward him, and he felt 
his own heart turn over, , answer 
it. Yes, Curtis was noble. 

Stern sank cross-legged on th« 
floor beside Curtis and gazed at 
him. The prickly sensation had 
ascended from his leg up through 
his chest and to his neck. But it 
didn't matter. Now, for a last 
time, he could feel the spell of 
that perfect friendship — before 
the end. 

What end? Why should there 
be any end to this eternal moment? 

Curtis noticed him now. Those 
half-closed eyes were strangely 
penetrating. They looked him 
through. 

"Well, Al," he said, "so you 
killed Schaughtowl ?" 

Stern looked at the kindly, godlike face and loved it. 

Killed whom? 

"Poor Al," Curtis said. He 
leaned over and laid his hand on 
the back of Stern's neck, fondling 1 
it much as one would a dog. 
"Poor old Al." 

Stern's heart leaped in joy. 
This was ecstasy. It must be expressed. It demanded expression. 
If he had possessed a tail, he 
would have wagged it. Perhaps 
there was a word for that bliss. 
There was, and with immense 
satisfaction he spoke it. 

"Gull Lup," he said.
