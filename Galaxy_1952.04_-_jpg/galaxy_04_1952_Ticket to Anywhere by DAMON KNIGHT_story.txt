Ticket to Anywhere by DAMON KNIGHT 


RICHARD Falk was a sane 
man. Up until three weeks ago he had been, so far as 
he had been able to discover, the 
only sane man left in a world of 
lunatics. 

Now he was a dead man. 
He lay in a metal coffin twenty 
yards long by three wide, airless, 
soundless. Behind the faceplate of 
his helmet, under the rime of subzero air, his Hps were bright blue, 
his cheeks, nose, forehead a lighter 
color, almost violet. The flesh was 
stiff as frozen leather. He did not 
move, breathe, or think; he was 
dead. 

Beside him, strapped to the 
bulging torso of his suit, was a 
metal box labeled: 

SCATO HEART PROBE 

See Instructions Inside 

All around him, strapped tight 
to the walls by broad loops of 
webbing, were boxes, cannisters, 
canvas bags, kegs. Cargo. His coffin was a freighter, going to Mars, 
and he was a frozen stowaway 
aboard it. 

In his brain the memories were 
neatly stacked, just as he had left 
them, not coupled now, each cell • 
isolated, the entropy of his mind 
fallen to zero. But uppermost 
among them, waiting for the thaw 
that might never come, wert the 
memories of his last few hours of 
life.

Once the ship was launched 
nd free, after he had slipped into 
, he had had to watt until its 
' ancing molecules had stilled, 
ieir heat all radiated away into 
pace. Then to wait again, heater 
urned off, listening to the silence 
■hile his own life's heat drained 
way: fingers and toes numb first, 
ars and nose following, then lips J 
heeks and all his flesh. Shivering 
i an agony of cold, he had 
/atched his breath fill the helmet 
vith cloud, the cold drops beadng on the colder faceplate. 

Tricky business, one that denanded courage. Act too soon, 
md the final drop into stillness 
vould be too slow — the freezing 
iquids in his body would crysalize, gashing his cells with a 
nillion tiny ice needles. Wait too 
ong, and the cold would steal his 
mtonomy : the order would go 
mt along his dendrites, "Act!" 
und there would be no response. 

He had waited until the false 
varmth of the dying had crept 
>ver him, the subtle destroyer 
-Umbering his limbs not with 
larslmess but with too much 
leacc. Twisting then in the dead

Irawn himself into the lane beween two looped bundles of 
argo. forcing them aside, until 
le reached the naked hull. There, 
pread-eagled against the chill 
metal, embracing it as one who 
-•rucifies himself glady. he died. 



The ship, stillest of sepulchers, 
hung fixed in the center of the 
Starry globe. So it might have 
remained for time without end, 
changeless, knowing no time, for 
there was no time here. The ship 
and all its contents — except its 
robot control, inactive now but 
warmed by a minute trickle of 
electrons — were very nearly at 
zero absolute. 

A RELAY clicked, communicating tremor through support 
frame and girder and hull. Time 
had begun again. The radar assembly in the prow began to emit 
timed clusters of radiation. Presently other relays snapped over, 
and then the engine awoke, whispered to itself an instant, and was 
silent. For an instant the ship 
had become once more a thing in 
motion, a pebble flung between 
the stars. Another such instant 
came, and another; then, at long 
last, the hull shuddered to the 
whip and carom of atmospheric 
molecules. Lightly it dipped into 
Martian air. out again, in again, 
making a great braking circuit of 
the globe. A final relay clicked, 
and FalkV coffin of a freighter 
hurled itself groundward, free of 
the skeletal ship whose rockets 
now flamed again, driving it back 
into the timeless deep. 

A parachute opened as the 
cargo hull hurtled downward: a 
preposterous parasol that would

not have held the weight for a 
minute against Earth's gravity, in 
Earth's air. But here it slowed 
that plummeting fall until the 
box met Martian sand not quite 
at killing speed. 

In the shell of the motionless 
freighter, Falk's corpse slowly 
thawed. 

II I S heart was beating. That 
was Falk's first conscious 
realization, and he listened to the 
tiny sound thankfully. His chest 
was rising and falling in a deep, 
slow rhythm: he heard the hiss 
and whisper of breath in his 
nostrils, and felt the veins pulse 
at his temples. 

Then came a prickling half pain 
in his arms and legs. He saw a 
ruddy haze of light on his closed 
lids. 

Falk opened his eyes to a pale 
glow that turned itself into a face. 
It went briefly, then came back. 
Falk could see it a little better 
now. Young, about thirty, paleskinned, with a blue beardshadow. Black, straight hair, a 
tittle untidy. Bl.u k-vimmed spectacles. Ironic lines on either side 
of the thin mouth. 

"All right now?" said the face. 

Falk murmured, "Think so." 

The young man nodded. He 
picked up something from the bed 
and began talking it apart, fitting 
the components into the cushioned troughs of a tnrtal box. It was 



the heart probe, Falk saw: the 
bulky control box, the short, 
capillary -thin needle. 

"Where did you get this?" the 
young man asked. "And what 
the devil were you doing aboard 
that freighter?" 

"Stole the probe." mumbled 
Falk. "And the suit, and the rest 
of the stuff. Dumped enough 
cargo to match my weight. Wanted to get to Mars. Only way was 
to stow aboard.** "You stole it?" 
the man repeated incredulously. 
"Then you never had the analogue treatment?" 

Falk smiled. "Had it, all right. 
Dozen times. Never took." He 
felt very tired. "Let me rest a 
minute, will you?" 

"Of course. Sorry." 

The young man went away, 
and Falk closed his eyes; he went 
through those last hours once, 
painful as they were, and then 
again. There was trauma there; 
mustn't let it get buried, to cause 
him trouble later. Accept it. know 
the fear, live with it. 

After a while the young man 
came back, carrying broth that 
steamed in a cup, and Falk 
drank it gratefully. Then he fell 
unknowing into sleep. 

When he awoke, he was stronger. He tried to sit up and found, 
to his mild surprise, that he could. 
The other, who had been sitting 
in an armchair across the room, 
put down his pipe and came over 



to thrust pillows behind Falk's 
back. Then he sat down again. 
The room was cluttered and had 
a stale odor. Floor, wall and 
ceiling were enameled metal. 
There were books and rolls of 
tape, records, in shelves; more 
piled on the floor. A dirty shirt 
was hanging from the doorknob. 

"Want to talk now?" the young 
man asked. "My name's Wolfert." 

"Glad to know you. Mine's 
Falk. You want to know about 
the analogue business first, I 
suppose." 

"And why you're here." 

"They're the same thing," Falk 
told him. "I'm immune to analogue treatment. I didn't know it 
for sure till I was ten, but I think 
I was* born that way. From 
seven on, I remember the other 
kids talking about their Guardians, and me pretending I had 
one. too. You know how kids 
are — anything to be part of 
the gang. 

"But for a long time, years, I 
wasn't certain whether everyone 
else was pretending like me, or 
whether I really was the only one 
without an invisible Guardian 
to talk to. 1 was pretty sure the 
kids Were lying when they said 
they could see theirs, but whether 
they were there at all or not was 
another question. I didn't know; 
actually it didn't bother me much. 
A kid that age doesn't distinguish 
readily between fact and fantasy. 



"When I was ten, 1 stole something. It was a book I wanted, 
which my father wouldn't let me 
have. The clerk was looking the 
other way; I put it under my 
jacket. Funny, I was halfway 
out before it struck me that I'd 
just proved I had no Guardian. 
By that time, you see, I'd decided that I'd just never seen 
mine, because I'd never done 
anything bad. I was proud of 
that, a little prissy about it if 
you want the truth. I only wanted 
this book. . . 

"I had sense enough, thank 
God, to burn that book after I'd 
finished reading it. If I hadn't, 
I don't suppose 1 would have 
lived to grow up." 

"Should think not." Wolfert 
said, his eyes fixed on Falk, alert, 
wary. "One man without any 
control could turn the whole 
applecart over. But 1 thought 
immunity was theoretically impossible." 

"I've thought about that a good 
deal. According to classic psychology, it is. I'm not unusually 
re si sta n t to h y pnoti c d rugs ; I 
go under all right. But the censor 
mechanism just doesn't respond. 
I've had the notion that I may be 
a mutation, developed in response to the analogue treatment 
as an anti -survival factor. But I 
don't know. As far as I've ever 
been able to find out, there are no 
more like me."

"Umm" said Wolfert, puffing 
at his pipe. "Should think your 
next move would be to get married, have children, see if they 
were immune, too." 

Falk stared at him soberly. 
"Wolfert, can you imagine yourself settling down happily in a 
community of maniacs?" 

rpHE other's face flushed. He 
took the pipe out of his mouth, 
looked down at it. Finally he said, 
"All right, I know what you 
mean." 

' Maybe you don't," said Falk, 
thinking, I've offended him. 
Couldn't help it. "You've been 
out here ten years, haven't you?" 

Wotfert nodded. 

"Things are getting worse," 
Falk told him. "I've taken the 
trouble to look up some statistics. They weren't hard to find; 
the damned fools are proud of 
them. The number of persons in 
mental institutions has gone 
steadily down since 1980, when 
the worldwide analogue program 
got under way. Extension of analogue program has gone steadily 
up. The two curves cancel out 
perfectly. 

"There are fewer and fewer 
people who have to be put away 
in madhouses — not because of 
any improvement in therapy, but 
because the analogue techniques 
are getting better and better. The 
guy who would have been hope


lessly insane fifty years ago now 
has a little man inside his head, 
controlling him, making him act 
normal. On the outside, he is 
normal; inside, he's a raving madman. Worse still, the guy who 
would have been just a little bit 
cracked, fifty years ago — and 
gotten, treatment for it — is now 
just as mad as the first guy. It 
doesn't matter any more. We 
could all be maniacs and the 
world would go on just as before." 

Wolfert grimaced wryly. "Well? 
It's a peaceful world, anyhow." 

"Sure," said Falk. "No war or 
possibility of war, no murders, 
no theft, no crime at all. That's 
because every one of them has a 
policeman inside his skull. But 
action begets reaction, Wolfert, 
in psychiatry as in physics. A 
prison is a place to get out of, if 
it takes you a lifetime. Push one 
plunger down, another will rise. 
Just a few years more, I think — 
ten or twenty, say — and you'll 
see that madhouse curve rise 
again. Because there's no escape 
from the repression of the Guard ians except a further retreat into 
insanity. And eventually a point 
is reached where no amount of 
treatment can help. What are 
they going to do then?" 

Wolfert tamped his pipe out 
slowly and stood up. "Meaning 
the psychiatrists who really govern Earth, I suppose. You've 
evidently figured out what you're 



TICKET T6 ANYWHERE 



going to do about all this.** 

Falk smiled. "Yes. With your 
help, I'm going to the stars." 

The other stood frozen a moment. "So you know about that," 
he said. "Well, come into the next 
room. I'll show it to you." 

FALK had known about the 
Doorway , but not th at it 
looked like this. It was a cubicle 
of something that looked like 
slick brown glass, ten feet high, 
six wide and deep. Inside, at waist 
level on the far wall, a lever, 
curiously shaped, like the head of 
an old-fashioned walking-stick, 
the slightly curved bar of the L 
parallel tp the wall. Nothing more 
than that. The floor of Wolfert's 
hut had" been assembled around 
it. It was the reason for the hut's 
existence, for Wolfert's dearly 
bought presence on Mars. 

"So that's it," said Falk. He 
took a step forward. 

"Stay where you are," Wolfert 
said sharply. "The area in front 
of the entrance is booby trapped." 

Falk stopped and looked at 
Wolfert, then at the metal cabinets bolted to the floor on cither 
side of the Doorway. Now that 
he looked at them closely, he 
could see the lenses of blacklight beams, and above them, 
metal ones that he guessed were 
discharge points. 

Wolfert confirmed it "If anything ever comes out, the current 



is supposed to get him. If it doesn't, I'm here." He put his hand 
on the rapid-fire automatic at his 
belt. 

Falk sat down slowly on a 
bench next to the wall. "Why 
are they so afraid of whatever 
might come out of the Doorway?" 

"You don't know the whole 
story, then. Tell me what you do 
know and I'll fill in the gaps." 

"The first Mars expedition, in 
'76, found it here. Apparently it 
was known to be an interstellar 
transportation system, but as far 
as I could learn, nobody ever 
actually tried it out. I knew that 
a caretaker had been left here — 
your predecessor, I imagine — after the idea of colonizing Mars 
was. abandoned. But I didn't 
know any of the reasons." 

Wolfert grinned briefly and 
leaned against the wall. "It's a 
transportation system, all right. 
Put an object in that cubicle, 
press the lever down, the object 
vanishes. So does most of the 
crowbar or whatever you use to 
work the lever. Ffft — gone. 

"We don't know how old it is 
and have no way of telling. The 
material it's made of is a hell 
of a lot harder than diamond. 
About half of it is underground. 
That was the way it was found, 
sitting perfectly level on the surface of the desert. I believe it 
must l^aye, sqnie sort of self-leyeling mechanism built into it, so 



140 




 



that it's always available no 
matter what changes the surface 
of the planet goes through. 

"Other ruins have been found 
on Mars, but they're all stone and 
quite primitive; nothing like this. 
The first expedition tried to get 
into its innards and find out what 
made it go, of course, but they 
couldn't. You can see in, only 
there's nothing to see." He gave 
his quick, ironic smile. "It's 
frustrating. Makes a physicist 
feel like a backward student in a 
kindergarten. We know that it's 
part of an interstellar network. 
One man did try it out — a member of the first expedition. He saw 
the cubicle and the lever, stepped 
in and pressed it to find out what 
would happen. He found out, 
all right, but I don't suppose the 
rest of us will ever know. 

"Then the second expedition 
brought along a batch of powerful 
all-wave senders and put them 
through. They picked up the first 
signal five years later, from the 
general direction of the star Regulus. Two more after seven years, 
then four during the thirteenth 
year, all from different directions. 
The other eight have yet to be 
heard from." 

He looked at Falk. "Now do 
you understand? The thing has 
no selectivity. It's completely random. We could walk through 
there and step out onto the planet 
of another star but it might take 



us a million years to find the 
way back by trial and error." 

Falk leaned back against the 
wall, trying to absorb the idea. 
"Maybe there are only a dozen 
or so stars in the network," he 
suggested. 

"Don't be a fool. Would the 
race that could build that stop 
at a dozen stars, or a thousand? 
They owned the Galaxy! Sixty 
billion stars. According to current 
theory, all the main ones have 
planets." 

He pointed to the Doorway. 
"Three hundred sixty cubic feet 
about," he said. "Enough for one 
man and supplies for a year, or 
fifteen people and supplies for a 
month. That's the limit to the size 
of the colony we could send out. 
With no assurance," he added 
bitterly, "that they'd land anywhere they could live for a minute." 

"Frustrating," Falk agreed. 
"But I still don't see why you're 
here with a gun. I can understand 
that if a member of the race that 
built that thing came through — 
and I must say it seems unlikely 
— that would be an important 
event. But why kill him when he 
steps out?" 

"It isn't my policy, Falk. I 
only work here." 

"I understand that. But do you 
have any idea what's behind the 
policy?" 

"Fear. They've got too much 



TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



141 



at stake." Wolfert leaned against 
the wall again, gesturing with his 
pipestem. "Do you realize that 
we could have interstellar colonization without this gadget, on 
our own? Give us a fuel source 
efficient enough so that we can 
accelerate continuously for as 
long as eight months, and we 
could reach the stars well within a 
man's lifetime. But do you know 
why we won't? They're even 
afraid to plant colonies here on 
Mars, or on Jupiter's moons, 
simply because transportation 
takes too long. Imagine a colony 
cut off from Earth by a five or ten 
year trip. Say something goes 
wrong — a man like yourself, naturally immune to analogue treatment. Or a man who somehow 
evade? the treatment, then manages to take it over, change it. Say 
he cuts out the one directive, 
'You must do nothing against 
the policy or interests of Earth.' 
Then you've got two communities 
again, not one. And then?" 

Falk nodded soberly. "War. 
They don't dare take even the 
smallest chance of that." 

"It isn't a question of daring; 
they can'r. That's one of the directives in their own conditioning, 
Falk." 

"So we'll never get to the stars." 

"Unless," said Wolfert, "somebody comes through that Doorway who understands how it 
works. The voltage is high, but 



not high enough to kill — humans, 
that is. He's supposed to be stunned, and if the current doesn't 
stop him and he tries to get back 
into the Doorway, I'm supposed 
to shoot to cripple. But at all 
events, he isn't to be allowed to 
go back and warn others to stay 
away from this station. Because 
if we knew how to alter the 
system so that it would be selective^ — " 

"Then we'd have colonies," finished Falk. "Every one just 
around the corner from Earth. All 
just alike. The loonies shall inherit the Universe. . . I hope nobody ever comes through." 

HE prowled the rest of the 
cabin with Wolfert, resting at 
intervals until his strength returned. There wasn't much to sec: 
the Doorway room, with a spyhole Falk had not noticed between it and the bedroom; the 
room that housed radio, radar 
and the computer that controlled 
the grazing orbits of the supply 
rockets; the power plant, and the 
compressor that kept the cabin's 
air at breathable pressure; kitchen, bathroom, and two storage 
chambers. 

The radio room had a window, 
Falk stood there a long time, 
looking out over the alien desert, 
violet now as the sun dropped toward the horizon. Stars glittered 
with unfamiliar brilliance in the 



142 




 



near-black, near-vacuum sky. 

In his mind he sketched hairlines of fire across the sky, a cat'scradle of stars. The thought that 
tomorrow he would be standing 
on a planet of one of those suns 
was frightening, but at the same 
time it lured him. He felt like 



Wolfert said abruptly,. "You 
haven't asked me whether I reported to Earth when I found 
you in that freighter shell." 

Falk looked at him. "I'll be 
gone long before they can do 
anything about me." 

"What made you so sure that 



a boy standing on the edge of an 
unsounded pool, whose black 
waters might hold treasure or 
death: he was afraid to dive, and 
yet he knew that he must. 

How could a man feel otherwise, he wondered, knowing that 
the way was open, that he had 
only to step forward? 



I'd be — sympathetic?" 

"You're a volunteer. They 
haven't got to the stage of conditioning people to do jobs they 
don't want to do, though I suppose they will eventually. You're 
a hermit. You don't like the madhouse they're making out of Earth 
any more than I do." 



TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



143 



"I don't know," said Wolfert. 
"Perhaps you're assuming too 
much similarity. I don't feel as 
you do about the analogue system, or the present government. 
I can see that it will lead to disaster eventually, but that doesn't 
bother me much. I'll be dead. But 
I want the stars. That's an emotional thing with me. . . There 
are no slugs in these cartridges." 
He indicated the gun at his hip. 
"Or in any of the ammunition 
I've got. They didn't condition 
me against that." 

"Lqpk," Falk said abruptly , 
"you've got a directive against 
stepping through that Doorway. 
Is that right?" 

The other nodded, 

"Well, but is there any reason 
why T couldn't knock you over 
the head and drag you through?" 

Wolfert smiled wryly, shaking 
his head. "Somebody's got to stay 
at this end." 

"Why?" 

"Because there's a chance that 
you'll find the secret out there, 
somewhere. That's what you're 
hoping, too, isn't it? You're not 
just looking for a place to hide — 
you could do that in a thousand 
places on Earth. You're after 
knowledge, and in spite of what 
I've told you, you're hoping you'll 
be able to bring it back and 
make the Earth over." 

"It sounds a little Messianic," 
said Falk, "but you're right." 



Wolfert shrugged, letting his 
gaze drift away again. "Well, 
then, there's got to be somebody 
here. Somebody with no slugs in 
his gun. If I went with you, 
they'd take good care to send a 
different sort of man next time." 
He met Falk's eyes again briefly. 
"Don't waste time feeling sorry 
for me. You may not believe it, 
but I'm quite happy here. When 
I'm alone, that is." 

Falk had been wondering why 
the government had not sent a 
married couple instead of a single 
man, who might go mad from 
sheer loneliness. Now it struck 
him that he had been stupid. 
When a man has a wife, he's no 
longer a hermit. After a moment 
Falk said, "Wolfert, I like you 
better than any man I've ever 
met. I hope you'll believe that." 

Wolfert hauled out a pipecleaner, a complicated thing of 
many hinged stems, the free ends 
stamped into shovel -shapes, tamper-shapes, probes. He said, "I'm 
afraid I dislike you, Falk, but it's 
nothing personal. I hate your guts 
because you're the master of your 
own mind." 

He turned and put out his 
hand, grinning. "Aside from that, 
I think you're a great guy." 

Falk gripped his hand. "I hope 
you're here when I get back." 

Til be here," said Wolfert, 
scraping his pipe bowl, "for an.othcr thirty-odd years, barring 




 



accidents. If you're not back by 
then, I don't suppose you'll be 
coining back at all." 

II 

A T his suggestion, Falk put on 
one of Wolfert's light Mars 
suits instead of the spacesuit he 
had worn in the freighter. The 
latter, designed for heavy-duty 
service in the orbital space station 
that circled Earth, was, as Wolfert pointed out, too clumsy for 
use on a planet's surface. The 
lighter suit furnished adequate 
protection in thin atmosphere, 
and was equipped with gadgetry 
that the other lacked: a headlamp, climbing gear, built-in 
compass, and food, water and 
disposal devices. It carried air 
tanks, but also had a compression 
outfit — which, given an atmosphere at least no poorer in oxygen 
than that of Mars, would keep the 
wearer alive for as long as the 
batteries held out. 

"You'll have to find a place 
where you can live off the land," 
said Wolfert. "If all the planets 
■you hit should happen to be dead, 
so will you be, very shortly. But 
this suit will give you longer to 
look, at least. I'd give you this 
gun, but it wouldn't do you any 
good without ammunition." 

He disconnected the boobytrap 
and stood aside as Falk went to 
the entrance of the doorway. Falk 



took one last look around at the 
bare metal room, and at Wolfert's 
spare figure and gloomy face. He 
stepped into the brown-glass cubicle and put his gloved hand on 
the lever. 

"See you," he said. 

Wolfert nodded soberly. 

Falk turned on his helmet 
lamp, rested his free hand near 
the control box at his belt and 
pressed the lever down. 

Wolfert vanished. An instant 
later Falk was aware that the 
lever was no longer beneath his 
hand. He turned, dazedly, and 
saw that it was back in its original position. 

Then he remembered the curious blank that had taken Wolfert's place, and he turned again 
to the entrance. He saw graywhite blankness, featureless, uncommunicative. Was this some 
kind of intermediary state? If so, 
how long did it last? He felt a 
surge of panic as he recalled that 
it was only assumption that the 
journey was instantaneous, and 
another as he thought of the eight 
transmitters that had never been 
heard from. 

He gripped the edge of the 
doorway and bent forward, looking downward, seeing only a 
chaos of dim colors of which his 
eye made nothing. Then he saw 
the cliff, and all the rest of the 
scene fell into perspective. 

He stood at the top of a sheer 



TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



14$ 



mountain — an impossible, ridiculous height. Whatever was at the 
bottom melted into a meaningless 
tapestry of grayed color. He 
looked to right and left, and saw 
nothing else. No sound came 
through the diaphragm of his helmet. He had only the tactile and 
muscular responses of his own 
body, and the hard reality of the 
Doorway itself, to assure him that 
he was real and alive. 

The planet was dead. He felt 
irrationally sure of it. There was 
not even a whisper of wind; only 
the featureless blanket of gray 
cloud, the cliff, the meaningless 
colors below. 

He looked at the kit slung to 
his belt: the pressure gauge, bottled litmus papers, matches. But 
there %as no point in testing this 
atmosphere. Even if it were 
breathable, there was no way of 
getting out of the Doorway, for 
the cliff began not more than an 
inch from the entrance. 

Falk went back to the lever, 
pressed it down again. 

This time he watched it as it 
reached the end of its stroke. 
There was no hint of transition. 
The lever was there, under his 
hand, and then it was back in 
the starting position. 

He turned. 

Deep blue night, blazing with 
stars. Underneath, a flat bluegreen waste that ran straight 
away into the far distance.

Falk stepped out onto the icy 
plain and looked around him, 
then upward. The sky was so like 
the one he had known as a boy 
in Michigan that it struck him almost as a conviction that this terminus was on Harth — in the Antarctic, perhaps, near the pole, 
where no explorer had ever happened across it. Then, as he 
looked automatically for the Dipper, Orion's Belt, the Southern 
Cross, he knew that he was 
wrong. 

Directly above him was a 
group of eight stars, two of them 
very brilliant, four arranged in a 
straight line, the rest spread out 
in an almost perfect semicircle. 
Falk knew that if he had ever 
seen that constellation before, lie 
would not have forgotten it. 

Now he looked down toward 
the horizon, blacker than the sky. 
How could he know that light, 
warmth, safety, knowledge were 
not hiding just beyond the curve 
of the planet? 

He turned back to the cubicle. 
He was here on sufferance, a man 
in a Mars suit, with weeks — or, 
with great luck, months or years 
— to live. He had to find what he 
sought within a pitifully small 
radius from the Doorway. 

Down went the lever again. 
Now it was still night, but when 
Falk went to the Doorway, he 
saw an avenue of great buildings 
under the stars. 


 



The air pressure gauge came 
out for the first time, low. but 
the compressor could handle it. 
The litmus papers — negative. The 

' matcli burned weakly, and only 

for an instant, but it burned. 
Falk started the compressor 

> and shut off the flow of air from 

the tanks slung at his back. Then 
he turned on his helmet light and 
marched off down the avenue. 

PYRAMID, cone, and wedgeshape, the buildings all sloped 
away as they rose, so that, for all 
their enormous bulk, they did not 
hide the sky. Falk looked up 
when he had taken a few steps, 
unreasonably expecting to see the 
half-circle constellation. But it 
was not there, and he realized 
with a shock that for all he knew, 
he might be halfway across the 
Galaxy from the spot where he 
had stood five minutes ago. 

H'- drew a picture of the Galaxy in his mind, an oval lens of 
stars against blackness. Near one 
focus of the ellipse he put a dot 
of brightness that stood for Sol. 
Then he made another dot. and 
drew a shining line between them. 
Then another dot, and another 
line; then another. They made 
i a sprawling letter N across the 

misty oval. 

It was incomprehensible. A race 
that could span the Galaxy, but 
could not choose one destination 
from another? 

TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



The only other alternative was 
that there was some function of 
the Doorway which men had 
failed to grasp, some method of 
selection that evaded them, as a 
savage might be bewildered in a 
modern tubeway system. But 
Falk's mind rejected that. The 
mechanism was simple, clear. A 
cubicle and a lever. Function is 
expressed by shape and the shape 
of the Doorway said "Go." It did 
not say "Where?" 

He looked again at the buildings. The upper quarter of them, 
he saw now, was badly eroded : 
layers inches deep had been eaten 
away. He glanced at the fine 
orange sand that paved the avenue and saw that it filled doorways almost to the top. 

The space between th*e sand 
and the tops of the doorways was 
narrow, but he thought he could 
squeeze through. He picked out 
one, centering it in the brilliant 
disk of his headlamp, and stood 
there, in the middle of the avenue, 
reluctant to move. 

He glanced back at the cubicle, 
as if for reassurance. It was still 
there, comfortably clear and 
sharp-lined, timeless. Now he realized what was troubling him. 
This city was dead — dead as the 
planet of the cliff, or the planet 
of ice. The buildings were stone; 
they had crumbled under the 
weather. 

Their makers were dust. 

147 



He had agreed with Wolfert 
that he was on a quest for knowledge, that he hoped the Doorway 
would eventually take him back 
to Sol, armed with knowledge, 
ready to remake the world. But 
it wasn't true. That had been his 
conscious idea, and it was a 
dream, a self-delusion, an excuse. 

He had no love for Earth, no 
conviction that humanity must 
be rescued. If that force had 
driven him, there would have 
been no logic in leaving. He could 
have stayed, worked himself into 
the governing elite, organized a 
change from within. His chance 
of success would have been small, 
but there would have been a 
chance. 

Yes, he might have done it, 
and % for what? Uncontrolled, 
mankind was not fit to colonize. 
Controlled, it dared not take the 
risk. 

But there had been another 
civilization that had been worthy 
of the stars, for it had conquered 
them. Falk did not believe it was 
dead. Stone crumbled, metal 
rusted, yet the Doorways still 
lived, still functioned, defying 
time. But that race was not here; 
it had left no trace of itself except the Doorway. 

Without another glance at the 
buildings around him, Falk 
turned and went back to the 
brown- glass cubicle. 

When he was three yards away 



from it, he saw the footprints. 

There were five of them, lightly 
impressed into the sand near the 
Doorway's entrance. Even with 
a careful search, Falk could not 
find any more. Two, apparently, 
pointed away from the cubicle; 
the other three were the returning 
trail, for one overlapped one of 
the previous set. 

They were smaller than Falk's 
booted prints, oval, slightly flattened along the sides. Falk stared 
at them as if the mere act of 
looking would make them give up 
more information, but they told 
him nothing. 

They were not human. What, 
though, did that prove? 

They could be the trace of a 
Doorway builder. Or they could 
have been made by a wanderer 
like himself. 

The bitterest thing of all was 
that, having found the trail, he 
could not follow it. For it led 
through the Doorway — to any 
one of sixty billion suns. 

Falk stepped into the cubicle 
and pressed the lever down once 
more. 

Ill 

WHITE "light sealed his eyes 
with pain, and there was a 
vicious torrent of heat. Gasping, 
Falk groped frantically for the 
lever. 

The after-image faded slowly. 



14& 




 



He saw night again, and the stars. 
That last one, he thought, must 
have been the planet of a nova. 
How many of those was he likely 
to run into? 

He stepped to the Doorway. A 
wasteland : not a stick, not a 
stone. 

He went back to the lever. 
Light again, of bearable intensity, and a riot of color outside. 

He saw a bright landscape under a tropic sun — gray -violet 
mountains in the distance, halfveiled by mist; nearer, tall stalks 
that bore heavy leaves and fronds 
of a startling blue-green; and directly ahead of him, a broad 
plaza that might have been cut 
from one monstrous boulder of 
jade. On either side were low, 
box -shaped structures of dark 
vitreous material: blue, brown, 
green and red. And in the middle 
of the plaza stood a group of 
slender shapes that were unquestionably alive, sentient. 

Falk's heart was pounding. He 
stepped behind the shelter of the 
entrance wall and peered out. 
Curiously, it was not the cluster 
of live things that drew him, but 
the buildings on either side. 

They were made of the same 
enduring, clean-edged substance 
as the Doorway. He had come, by 
blind chance, to the right place 
at last. 

Now he stared at the creatures 
grouped in the middle of the 



plaza. For some reason, they were 
disappointing. They were slender 
S-shapes, graceful enough in repose ; lizard-shapes, upright on 
two legs; pink of belly and umber 
of hack. But in spite of the bandoliers slung from their narrow 
shoulder, in spite of their quick, 
patterned gestures as they spoke 
together, Falk could not convince 
himself that he had found the 
people he sought. 

They were too manlike. 

One turned away while two 
others spoke; came back leaning 
at a passionate angle, thrust himself between the two, gesturing 
wildly. Shouted down, he again 
left, and stalked a half-circle 
around the group. He moved as 
a chicken moves, awkwardly, 
thrusting his long neck forward 
at each step. 

Of the five others, two argued, 
two merely stood with drooping, 
attentive heads and watched; and 
the last kept a little apart, gazing 
around him disdainfully. 

They were funny, as monkeys 
are funny because they resemble 
men. We laugh at our mirrored 
selves. Even the races of man 
laugh at each other, when they 
should feel compassion. 

They're tourists, Falk thought. 
One wants to go to the Lido; another insists they see the Grand 
Canal first; the third is furious 
with both of them for wasting 
time; the next two are too timid 



TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



to interfere, and the last or» 
doesn't care. 

He couldn't imagine what their 
reaction to him would be. They 
might want to take him home as 
a souvenir. He was anxious to get 
into those buildings, but he'd 
have to wait until the creatures 
were out of sight. 

While he waited, he got out his 
atmosphere testing kit. The pressure gauge showed a trifle less 
than Earth normal; the litmus 
papers did not react; the match 
burned cheerfully, just as it 
■ would have on Earth. Falk 
cracked the helmet valve cautiously and sniffed. 

After the stale air of the suit, 
the breath he inhaled was so good 
that he could almost taste it. It 
wa% fresh, faintly warm, and 
sweet with flower fragrance. Falk 
opened the helmet seam, tipped 
the helmet back and let the 
breeze wash over his face and 
hair. 

He peered out, and saw with 
sudden dismay that the party 
was trooping directly toward him. 
He ducked his head back inside, 
glanced instinctively at the lever, 
then looked out again. 

They were running now; they 
had seen him. They ran very 
clumsily, heads darting strenuously forward and back. The one 
in the lead was opening and shutting his triangular mouth, and 
Falk heard faint yawps. He

leaped out of the cubicle, cut 
sharply to the right, and ran. 

The nearest building with a 
visible ^.opening, unfortunately, 
was some distance down the line, 
between the lizards and Falk. He 
glanced back when he was halfway there. The lizards were considerably strung out now, but the 
leader was only a few yards away. 

They were faster than they 
looked. Falk put his head down 
and tried to make his heavy boots 
move in a sprint. Almost to the 
door, he looked back again. The 
lizard was one jump away> balltipped fingers outspread. 

Falk turned in desperation and, 
as the lizard came up, swung a 
knotted fist to the point of its 
snout. He heard its steam-whistle 
screech, saw it collapse, and then 
he was diving through the open 
door ahead. 

The door closed gently behind 
him — a sheet of glassy substance, 
the same blue as the walls, gliding down to seal the opening. 
Through its transparency he 
could see the dark shapes of the 
lizards crowding around, leaning 
to pry at the bottom of the door, 
gesticulating at each other. It was 
plain, at any rate, that the door 
was not going to open for them. 

Whether it would open for him, 
when he wanted it to, was another matter. 

He looked around him. The 
building was a single room, huge, 



so long and deep that he could 
barely see the far walls. Scattered 
over the floor were boxes or 
chests, racks, shelves, little ambiguous mounds. Nearly all the 
objects Falk could see were fashioned of the same glasslike material. 

There was no dust in the room ; 
but now that Falk thought of it, 
he realized that there had been 
none in any of the Doorways, 
either. How that was done he 
could not conjecture. He went to 
the nearest object, a file or rack, 
formed apparently to take many 
things of diverse shapes and sizes. 
It was a quarter empty now, and 
the remaining contents had a 
jumbled look. 

He picked up an orange-glass 
spindle, full of embedded threads, 
or flaws, that looped in a curious 
pattern from one end to the other. 
He put it down, took a hollow 
sphere of opal. It was made in 
halves and seemed to be empty, 
but Falk could find no way to 
take it apart. He replaced it, and 
took a brown object shaped like 
a double crescent with a clear 
fracture plane running diagonally 
through it . . . 

Half an hour later, he realized 
that he was not going to find any 
picture-books, or engineeri ng 
manuals, or arty one thing that 
would unlock the mystery of the 
Doorway people for him. If there 
were any knowledge to be gained 
there, it would have to come from 
the building as a whole.. 

The lizards distracted him. He 
could see them through the walls 
of the building, pressing their 
snouts against the glass, staring 
with little round eyes, gesturing 
at him. 

The group finally broke up, 
leaving only one to guard the 
exit; the others dispersed. Falk 
saw one go into the building directly across the plaza. The door 
closed behind him. A little later 
another approached and pounded 
on the door; but it did not open 
until the first lizard came close 
to it inside. Some automatic 
mechanism, beyond Falk's fathoming, evidently responded to the 
presence or absence of any living 
thing inside each building. When 
the last person left, the door 
stayed open; when another person entered, it shut and would 
not open for the next unless the 
first person allowed it. 

That added one item to the 
description of the Doorway people that Falk was building in his 
mind. They were not propertyconscious, not afraid that thieves 
would enter in their absence, for 
the doors stood open when they 
were gone, but they evidently respected each other's love of privacy. 

Falk had previously thought of 
this building as a vast factory, or 
laboratory, or dormitory — a place 



designed to serve a large number 
of people, anyhow. Now he revised his opinion. Each building, 
he thought, was the private domain of one person, or, if they 
had family groups, only two or 
three. But how could one person 
or one family use all this space, 
all these possessions? 

He asked himself what a cliffdweller would make of a millionaire's triplex apartment in New 
York. It helped, but not enough. 
The objects around him were all 
specialized tools; they would not 
function for him, and so told him 
nothing about the Doorway 
builders. There was nothing that 
he could compare to a bed, a 
table, a shower bath. He could 
not visualize the people who had 
lived here. 

With an effort, he forced himself to stop thinking in terms of 
men. The facts were important, 
not his prejudices. And then what 
had been a barrier became a road. 
There were no beds, tables, showers ? Then the Doorway people 
did not sleep; they did not eat; 
they did not bathe. 

Probably, thought Falk, they 
did not die. 

The riddle of the deserted 
chamber mocked him. How, having built this city, would they 
leave it? How would they spread 
the network of the Doorways 
across the face of the Galaxy, 
and then leave it unused? 

The first question answered itself. Looking at the littered chamber, Falk thought again of his 
comparison of the cliff-dweller 
and the millionaire. Not a millionaire's triplex, he told himself 
... a tent. 

Once there had been something 
of particular interest on this 
world. No telling what it had 
been, for that had been millions 
of years ago, when Mars was a 
living world. But the Doorway 
people, a few of them, had come 
here to observe it. Finished, they 
had gone away, leaving their tents 
behind, as a man might abandon 
a crude shelter of sticks and 
leaves. 

And the other things they had 
le% behind them? The cubes, 
cones, rods, odd shapes, each one 
beyond price to a man? Empty 
cans, thought Falk, toothpaste 
tubes, wrapping paper! 

r| iHE sun was redder, nearer 
the horizon. Falk looked at 
the chronometer strapped to the 
wrist of his suit, and found to 
his surprise that it was more 
than five hours since he had left 
Wolfert on Mars. 

He took food out of his pack 
and looked at the labels on the 
cans. But he was not hungry; he 
did not even feel tired. 

He watched the lizards outside. 
They were scurrying around in 
the plaza now, bringing armloads 



of junk from the building, packing them into big red boxes, A 
curious construction floated into 
view down at the far end of the 
plaza. It was a kind of airboat, 
an open shell with two lizards 
riding in it, supported by two 
winglike extensions with streamlined, down-pointing shapes at 
their ends. 

It drifted slowly until it hovered over the pile of boxes that 
the lizards had gathered. Then 
a hatch opened in its belly, and 
a hook emerged at the end of 
three cords. The lizards on the 
plaza began slinging loops of cord 
from their boxes to the hook. 

Falk watched them idly. The 
hook began to rise, dragging the 
boxes after it, and at the last moment one of the lizards tossed another loop over it. 

The new box was heavy; the 
hook stopped when it took up the 
slack , and the airboat dipped 
slightly. Then it rose again, and 
the hook rose, too, until the whole 
load was ten feet off the ground. 

Abruptly, one of the three cords 
snapped. Falk saw it whip 
through the air, saw the load 
lurch ponderously to one side, 
and the airboat dip. The pilot instantly sent the boat down, ts 
take up the strain on the remaining cords. 

The lizards were scattering. 
The load struck heavily and, a 
moment later, so did the airboat. 



154 



OALAXT SCIENCE FICTION 



It bounced, skidded wildly and 
came to rest as the pilot shut off 
the power. 

The lizards crowded around 
again, and the two in the boat 
climbed down for an interminable 
conference. Eventually they got 
aboard again. The boat rose a 
few feet while the lizards disengaged the hook. Then there was 
another conference. Falk could 
see that the doors of the boat's 
hatch were closed and had a 
crumpled look. Evidently they 
were jammed shut. 

The boat finally came down 
once more, and with much argument and gesticulation the boxes 

TICKET TO ANYWHERE 



were unpacked and some of their 
contents reloaded into two new 
boxes, these being hoisted with 
much effort into the cockpit. The 
rest was left strewn around the 
plaza. 

The airboat lifted and went 
away, and most of the lizards followed it. One straggler came over 
for a last look at Falk. He peered 
and gestured through the wall 
for a while, then gave it up and 
followed the rest. The plaza was 
deserted. 

Some time passed before Falk 
saw a pillar of white flame that 
lifted, with a glint of silver at its 
tip, somewhere beyond the city; 

157 



and grew until it arched upward 
to the zenith, and dwindled, and 
vanished. 

So the lizards had spaceships. 
They did not dare use the Doorways, either. Not fit . . . too much 
like men. 

T7ALK went out into the plaza 
and stood while the freshening breeze ruffled his hair. The 
sun was dropping behind the 
mountains, and the whole sky 
had turned ruddy, like a great 
crimson cape streaming out of 
the west. Falk watched, reluctant 
to leave, until the colors faded 
through violet to gray, and the 
first stars came out. 

It was a good world. A man 
coiHd stay here, probably, and 
live his life out in comfort and 
ease. No doubt there were exotic 
fruits to be had from those trees. 
Certainly there was water. The 
climate was good. Falk thought 
sardonically that there could be 
no dangerous wild beasts, or 
those twittering tourists would 
never have come here. 

If all a man wanted was a hiding place, there could be no better world than this. For a moment 
Falk was strongly tempted. He 
thought of the cold dead worlds 
he had seen, and wondered if he 
would ever find a place as fair 
as this again. Also, he knew now 
that if the Doorway builders still 
lived, they must long ago have 



drawn in their outposts. Perhaps 
they lived on only one planet, 
out of all the billions. Falk would 
almost surely die before he found 
it. 

He looked at the rubble the 
lizards had left in the middle of 
the plaza. One box was still filled, 
but burst open; that was the one 
that had caused all the trouble. 
Around it was a child's litter 
of baubles — pretty glass toys, red, 
green, blue, yellow, white. 

A lizard, abandoned here by his 
fellows, would no doubt be happy 
enough in the end. 

With a sigh, Falk turned back 
to the building. The door opened 
before him, and he collected his 
belongings, fastened down his helmet, strapped on his knapsack 
again. 

The sky was dark now. Falk 
paused to look up at the familiar 
sweep of the Milky Way. Then 
he switched on his helmet light 
and turned toward the waiting 
Doorway. 

As the light fell across the 
burst box the lizards had left, 
Falk saw a hard edge of something thrusting out. It was not the 
glassy adamant of the Doorway 
builders; it looked like stone. 

Falk stopped and tore the box 
aside. 

He saw a slab of rock, roughly 
smoothed to the shape of a wedge. 
On its upper face characters were 
incised. They were in English. 




 



With blood pounding in his cars, 
Falk knelt by the stone and read 
what was written there.

JAMES E. TANNER 
NATIVE OF EARTH 

Faik stood up, blinded by the 
glory of the vision that grew in 
his mind. He thought he understood now why the Doorways 
were not selective, and why their 
makers no longer used them. 

Once — a billion years ago, perhaps — they must have been uncontested owners of the Galaxy. 



But many of their worlds were 
small planets, like Mars, not large 
enough to keep their atmospheres 
and their water forever. Millions 
of years ago, they must have 
begun to fall back from these. 
And meanwhile, Falk thought, on 
the steaming worlds that now 
were cooling, the lesser breeds 
had arisen. The crawling, brawling things. The lizards. The men. 
Creatures not worthy of the stars. 

So the way was made long, and 
the way was made hard; and the 
lesser breeds stayed on their planets. But for a man, or a lizard, 
who would give up all that he 1 
called "life" for knowledge, the 
way was open. 

Falk turned off the beam of his 
head-lamp and looked up at the 
diamond mist of the Galaxy. 
Where would he be, a thousand 
years from today? Standing on 
that mote of light, or that? 

Not dust, at any rate. Not dust, 
unrnourned, unworthy. He would 
be a voyager with a destination, 
and perhaps half his journey 
would be done. 

Wolfert would wait in vain for 
his return, but it would not matter; h£ was happy, if you called 
his existence happiness. And on 
Earth, the mountains would rise 
and fall long after the question 
of human survival had been forgotten. By that time, perhaps, 
Falk would be home.
