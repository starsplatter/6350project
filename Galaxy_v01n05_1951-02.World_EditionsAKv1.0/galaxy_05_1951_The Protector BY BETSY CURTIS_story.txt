The Protector BY BETSY CURTIS 

HOW come I live here on 
Gorlin permanent? Well, 
it's something like this. 



Thtre is nobody real surprised 
when some scientist writes an article 
in the Sunday supplement about 
the primitive tribes of Anestha dying out, probably. The Anesthon 
natives is freaks, anyway, and folks 


just naturally figure they can't last 
long in stiff competition. If you 
are like them and your body don't 
feel any pain any time, you need a 
nursemaid around to keep you from 
doing dumb things, like walking in 
front of a truck or starving to 
death. 

I am here on Gorlin a couple 
times and know about 'em. Some 
folks think it's comical to watch 
the space crews think up ways to 
give an Anesthon a workout. I see 
one Anesthon girl — a real looker 
she is, too — dance fourteen hours 
before she gives out, just for a 
bottle of perfume and one of them 
Venusian fur lou/ige robes. They 
sure enjoy their pleasures, even if 
they never feel no pain. You feeling any? More thiska? 

Hey, Noor! Another round of 
thiska for the boys! 

Well, they can feel your feelings, and any thoughts that are 
about them, too. I guess all they 
live for is pleasure and a pat on 
the back. One time a little runty 
Anesthon guy even builds a whole 
stone blockhouse for a first looie, 
when the looie thinks real hard 
that the little guy looks like a firstrate hod carrier. Time the house is 
built, the Anesthon's hands is all 
bloody and one ankle broke where 
a chunk of rock drops on him. He 
don't notice it, of course. 

Pierre gets all worked up about 
them Anestha dying out. That's my 
boy Pierre, the heavyweight. I name 
him Pierre so's nobody thinks he is 



tough till afterward. He comes from 
Gorlin. Of course I have to stable 
him on Venus long enough for a 
legal residence, or the Boxing Commission would have him investigated and maybe banned from the 
ring as a telepath. Tough training 
him, too. He can't see the sense of 
fighting, but, man, he can stay in 
the ring all night. He never does 
get real speedy on his feet, but he 
learns fast and packs a wicked left. 
I don't have to lie when I am 
thinking real hard he is champeen 
material. 

Anyhow, Pierre gets all worked 
up over his race getting extinct. He 
has a sister who is glenched to some 
nice boy and his old man is some 
sort of a chief. He is all for beating 
it back by the next via- Venus ship 
to see what is getting at the old 
folks at home. I calm him down 
though, give him a couple of shots 
of thiska and say I better take him 
around to see that scientist-dopester and get the inside first. I have 
to go everywhere with him to see he 
doesn't break a leg and forget to 
tell me about it. 

SO WE hope a TAT in Chi and 
make for Washington where 
this science fellow is with some 
Smithsonian Institute. He is nice 
enough about seeing us, but he can't 
figure how a Chinaman like Pierre 
has any call to be steamed'up about 
the Anestha (you seen these Anestha with their slick black hair and 
goldy skin and smooth eyelids like 



76 




 



a Earth Chinaman) so I have to 
break down 'and tell him about 
Pierre being an Anesthon. 

That scientist is pretty peeved 
with me bringing Pierre into the 
Earth system, but when I tell him 
Pierre wants to go back to help out 
the folks, he kind of clams up and 
says the article is just one of those 
Sunday paper things. There don't 
really seem to be anything wrong 
on Gorlin except that all the workers are getting more careless than 
usual, falling off walls they are 
building and getting hit by rocks 
during blasting, or walking in 
front of full cars in the mines. 

Pierre gives the man a look. 
"Workers? Mines? Blasting?" he 
says. "What gives? There are no 
mines on Gorlin," he says, "just a 
few quarries and a lot of big farms. 
We never have to kill ourselves 
working. What gives?" he says. 

"Oh," the man comes back, 
"there's a couple big targ mines in 
full swing. Some big Earth concern is shipping out the stuff five 
freighters a day to Mercury for 
mass insulation. All native workers. They don't get paid much — 
weej cigarettes, bubble bath, some 
thiska, electro-fur blankets, stuff 
like that — but I don't hear yapping. 
If I do, I report anything that looks 
like slavery." Of course he says it 
with a lot of grammar and it takes 
him a half hour, but that is the 
slant. 

He wants to gab some then with 
Pierre. I see that the boy is getting 



jittery and homesick, too, when the 
guy starts raving about swimming 
in the flaff pools and the feeling of 
katweela petals under your bare 
feet, so I says we have to catch a 
plane and get out of there. 

Pierre still wants to head for 
Gorlin. He says his people must 
be unhappy about something or 
they are more careful. Life on Gorlin is too much fun to just go and 
die for no reason. 

I try to pep him up on the way 
back to Chi, talking about his next 
fight with Kid Bop, but he says he 
can't see any reason in fighting, 
either, just now. I tell him I think 
he kind of likes fighting, but he 
says what he likes is the nice things 
I think about him when he wins, 
and he is too worried about his family to pay much attention to what I 
think just now. 

WELL, we are both pretty flush 
from one of the best fight 
seasons I ever see and a rest won't 
hurt the boy, so I say okay, we are 
going by the first liner off the Flats. 

"You don't have to go, Joe," he 
says. "Keep your dough and train a 
couple more kids. I may not be 
back," he says. 

"Look, boy," I says, "you know 
what the food is like on them 
liners," I says, kind of kidding, 
"and if there's nobody around to 
cram it down you, you don't eat, and 
if you don't eat, you starve — and 
if you starve, you are in no condition to cheer up your sister and

your old man. Besides," I says, "I 
can afford a vacation and you're the 
only fighter I want to work with. 
You've got a real future," I says, 
"and I'm going to bring you back 
alive." 

I guess that makes him feel kind 
of good, because he grins first time 
since he reads that paper and says, 
"All right, Joe, come on along." 

WE BUY a few pretties and 
neckties in the station and 
ship out of Chi for the Flats on the 
next TAT. Pierre wants to get some 
perfume for his' sister, but I tell 
him we can get better on Venus, 
where all the good stuff is made. 

The trip from Venus Space Base 
to Gorlin is fast on account of overdrive, but even so I have no trouble passing Pierre off as a fighter 
who has the jitters and is headed 
for a vacation where he learns to 
take it easy the easy way. He is 
always burning his fingers or his 
mouth on a cigarette, and I have 
to keep an eye on him all the time. 
Nerves, I explain to the passengers. 

When we land, Pierre is all for 
hunting up his folks, but I says no, 
if there is some trouble, it is 
smarter to case the joint. We check 
in at the swanky tourist hotel. She 
is new since I am on Gorlin a 
couple years ago and what class! 
She is built around one of the biggest flaff pools on the whole planet 
and our room is completely lined 
with padded velvety stuff, sort of a 
deep red color, and the bathroom 



has a cloudrift shower that you 
nearly float away on. 

But Pierre just doesn't relax. I 
keep trying to make him get in the 
shower, but it is no use. "He says 
he is just too worried to take any 
pleasure in it. I don't think we 
ought to go scouting till night and 
that is thirty some hours yet, but 
when I see he is settling down to 
wear the fuzz right off the floor 
walking round and round, I give in, 
feed him a sandwich I bring from 
the ship, and we stroll off in the 
woods like we are looking for flowers. 

There are no signs around the 
hotel saying which way to the 
mines, so we set off to circle the 
hotel and spaceport clearing to look 
for the rail-line that brings the targ 
to the port. I figure we have gone 
about two-thirds of the way around 
when I nearly fall over a guy sitting on the ground with his head 
in his hands. What I think is katweela flowers is just the red Anesthon kloa he has on. He looks up 
sort of dull and then he sees Pierre 
with me. He lets out a yip and sits 
back hard on the ground and 
moans. Pierre yanks the fellow up 
on his feet and hugs him and starts 
to jabber away so fast I can't tell 
what he is saying. Foreigners always talk faster than anybody else. 
The other guy puts in a word or 
two every once in a while and then 
he scrams off through the trees. 

"That's Noor," Pierre informs 
me, "the guy my sister Jennel is 



78 




 



glenched to. He's gonna get us a 
couple of kloas so nobody'll notice 
us around the mine. He's feeling 
mighty low, but I can't figure out 
why. He says Jennel and the old 
man are okay, only he can't ever 
carry Jennel to his own house because he ain't man enough. I don't 
get it. He can make a good fighter, 
Joe." 

BEFORE you can count three, 
Noor is back again with the 
kloas and Pierre strips and gets into 
his. I ain't too keen to show my 
shapelies, but Pierre starts grabbing 
my shirt and I have to put the kloa 
on or else. The boys head south at 
a good clip and I tag along trying 
to catch up and find out the score. 
When Pierre sees I am making like 
winded, he slows down and tells me 
we are going to the mine owner's 
fancy dump about two miles down 
the drag. Pierre says Noor tells him 
the mine owner doesn't like him 
and he has to leave us when we get 
in sight of the house. 

After about a mile, Noor begins 
to drag along. Then he just sits 
down under another tree and says 
that is the end of the line for him. 
He points through the trees and 
says go on, maybe he is still there 
when we come back, maybe not. 
While Pierre is jawing with him, I 
look up the trail and see a Anesthon 
babe about a hundred feet away. 
You can tell it is a babe from one 
of them blue and green mollos 
draped around her over the kloa. 



Noor sees her, too, and takes off 
like a bat back the way we come. 
Pierre jogs ahead and when I get 
up with him, there he is hugging 
and jabbering again. 

"My sister Jennel," he says, and, 
"Jennel, this is Joe, my manager." 

She is a cute trick with lots of 
yumph showing through the molla. 
She stands kind of slumped, 
though, and a few of the flowers in 
her shiny black hair are pretty 
mashed. 

" 'Smarter, Jennel?" I says. "You 
look kind of dragged out for a 
dame whose brother comes home 
practically a champeen. Katweela 
flowers go on strike?" I says, just 
try;ng to make talk. 

She slumps a little more and says 
the boss don't like her and how it's 
too bad her brother has to come 
home and find her still alive and 
cluttering up the woods. 

I tell Pierre she better take us to 
this boss that don't like a babe like 
her, but she just shakes her head 
and says go that way and we come 
to the house. Then she says the 
boss makes the natives use the employees' entrance on the other side 
of the house and she offers to take 
and show us the way. She kind of 
twitches when she says "natives." 

She don't even says yes or no all 
the way to the gate till, just before 
we get there, I trip on a root and 
bang my knee on a rock on the way 
down. Well, I howl and cuss some 
and she comes up close and asks 
me what seems to be the matter. I 



THE PROTECTOR 



79 



tell her the blamed rock hurts my 
knee and I think real hard about 
how her knee would feel if a rock 
hits it and she busts right out crying. 

"Oh, you poor man, you poor 
man, you," she sobs. "That rock 
don't like you at all." 

"It don't hate me, either," I says. 
"It's only a rock." 

"But it makes a hurt to you. It 
don't love you and now you are not 
happy where there's any rocks because they don't love you," she 
says, and she helps me up and starts 
dragging me along, still crying like 
crazy. 

I DON'T make nothing out of 
that, but pretty soon we come 
to a little gate in a thick row of 
bushes. Jennel lets go of me then 
and says she hopes Pierre is a strong 
man >and a good worker and that the 
boss likes him. And then she gives 
a big sigh and says if the boss 
don't like him, we can find her 
over there where the men are cutting down a bunch of trees, because 
if one of the trees likes her, it will 
maybe fall on her pretty soon. 

Pierre tells her to wait right there 
by the gate because he is coming 
back. He isn't looking for work so 
the boss won't care if he is strong or 
not. She just sighs again and sits 
down on the grass and whimpers. 

Pierre tries once more to get her 
to tell him what is the matter, but 
all she says is that their father and 
some other fellow named Frith are 



.up at the big house. They are being talked to by the boss about not 
getting out enough targ on the 
shifts where they are foremen, and 
she says how sad it is about Pierre 
coming home. 

It is just beginning to filter 
through my thick skull that the boss 
is connected with all this dying out 
of the Anestha, as the Sunday paper 
puts it, and I grab Pierre away 
from Jennel and hustle him through 
.the gate. 

"Look, Pierre," I says, "we'll go 
around and listen by them long 
windows and see what cooks. I'll 
bet that boss is up to something 
dirty in there. If he is the one who 
messed up Jennel," I says, "we 
better just mess him up some." 

There is nobody in sight on the 
lawn and we just march up to the 
window easy as pie. There is this 
big booming voice giving somebody what for. 

"You poor miserable idiots," 
yells this voice, "you can't keep the 
workers off the tracks and you get 
out less than twenty tons of targ 
since last night, and then you ^vaste 
a whole charge of nitro by not telling the watchman he's not supposed 
to smoke in the enclosure. All those 
people are dead and it's your fault." 

I hear a sniffle behind me and 
when I turn around, there is Jennel. 
She ha$ sneaked up behind us to 
see what we are going to do. 

"That's how he talks to me, too," 
she lets us know in a whisper, 
"only he says I am not fit to even 



80 




 



wash dishes, let alone ever have a 
house of my own . . . when I drop 
one of his plates a little while ago. 
He says I am looking in a mirror 
instead of where I am going and 
he hopes I see what an ugly pan I 
have, because I ought to know it 
and keep out of people's way so 
they won't have to look at me." 
Her tears splash right down on the 
grass. 

"And that's not all," the yelling 
inside goes on. "Not only do you 
kill off all my workers, but at this 
rate I'm losing money paying you 
four packs of cigarettes a day. If I 
have to blast off and start from 
scratch in some other part of this 
blamed universe, you stupid, gutless . . . why, you aren't even men. 
You worms don't even run when 
you see a car coming at you. Too 
blamed dumb to come in out of 
the rain." 

I stick my head around the corner and look in, and there is the 
back of a big guy in a Mercurymade suit and with a bald head 
that is red all the way round to the 
back of his neck. On the other side 
of the room I see a couple of the 
sorriest-looking Anestha God ever 
makes, shuffling their feet and looking like kicked dogs. 

I turn to Pierre. "Go in there 
swinging," I says, like at a fight, 
and pull the window open. 

"He won't like me," Pierre says, 
hanging back. "He says Anestha are 
dumb cowards. Maybe he knows. 
Maybe I won't dare hit Him." 



"You get in there and poke him, 
boy," I says and give him a push. 
"I like you and I see you fight and 
the Anestha got more guts than 
anybody!" 

THE big guy hears us and turns 
around. "Get out of here, you 
mangy natives," he bellows. "You 
good for nothing, shivering, sniveling, cowardly boobs. I'm not ready 
for you yet." He is shaking a 
whippy-looking cane at me and 
Pierre, and I think he has turned 
purple. 

"We're ready for you, though," 
I yell back. I climb into the room 
pulling Pierre in after me. "Pierre's 
no sniveling coward and you can 
quit talking to his brave, heroic, 
self-sacrificing father like that. Put 
'em up and defend yourself, you 
howling ape," I yell, "because 
Pierre is going to give you the beating of your howling life!" 

I see Pierre's old man and the 
other fellow spruce up some. 

The big guy sits down in a chair 
real quick, and, sucking in a big 
breath, he starts going all fatherly 
at Pierre, telling him that he 
doesn't want to have to hit him 
back, because Pierre will not feel it 
when he kills him, which'he doesn't 
want to have to do because Pierre 
is just a poor weak Anesthon who 
don't know from nothing, and he 
doesn't want to injure any of his 
workers and he is just telling 
Pierre's 'old man a few things to 
protect the Anestha. 



THE PROTECTOR

Pierre looks at me kind of doubtful. 

"Go on, hit the fat bully," I says, 
real icy. "He has it coming. You 
owe it to your old man and Noor 
and Jennel here. Go ahead and 
show him what kind of champeens 
the Anestha can turn out. It's just 
for his own good," I says, "so hit 
him now. Then you can tell your 
dad what a great guy you are." 

Pierre's left obediently swings 
into the lug's jaw with a crack like 
a rifle. He don't even watch the big 
guy sag down on the floor. He begins hugging his father and the 
other fellow and grinning and jabbering away like blue blazes. 

The big guy is still breathing, but 
out cold, so I go to look for a tele^ 
viz. I figure the authorities better 
hear my story before the big guy 
wakes up. 

After I make my spiel, the port 
chief says to come in and bring 
Pierre and his father and Frith and 
Jennel and Noor, too, if we can 
find him, and make an official re


corded report. He is sending a doctor out by 'copter. 

We beat it for the port, leaving 
the fat boss sleeping on the floor. 

We all stay in protective custody 
at the hotel, swimming in naff and 
lounging around the thiska bar for 
a couple of weeks, until the commission headed by that scientist 
from the Smithsonian Institute 
comes out and takes the boss back 
to Earth. He has to see a judge 
about why he should not go into 
stir for a while for psychological 
coercion or something like that. 

Before they leave, the commission hands me an official charge at 
a hundred thou a year to stay as 
Protector of Morale to the Anestha. 
That is better than the fight racket, 
but the protectorship is a laugh. I 
can't even go out for a walk without a couple dozen Anestha tagging 
along, to keep me from stubbing 
my toe on some unfriendly pebble, 
or socking my eye on some unloving 
devil of a doorknob.
