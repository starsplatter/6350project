THE FIREMAN By RAY BRADBURY 

THE four men sat silently 
playing blackjack under a 
green drop-light in the dark 
morning. Only a voice whispered 
from the ceiling: 

"One thirty-five a.m. Thursday 
morning, October 4th, 2052, A.D. 
. . . One *forty a.m. . . . one 
fifty . . ." 



Mr. Montag sat stiffly among the 
other firemen in the fire house, 
heard the voice-clock mourn out the 
cold hour and the cold year, and 
shivered. 

•The other three glanced up. 

"What's wrong, Montag?" 

A radio hummed somewhere. 
". . . War may be declared any 

hour. This country stands ready to 
defend its destiny and . . ." 

The fire house trembled as five 
hundred jet-planes screamed across 
the black morning sky. 

The firemen slumped in their 
coal-blue uniforms, with the look 
of thirty years in their blue-shaved, 
sharp, pink faces "and their burnt


colored hair. Stacked 
were glittering piles 
helmets. Downstairs 
dampness 
slept, the 



behind them 
of auxiliary 
in concrete 



the fire monster itself 
silent dragon of nickel

and tangerine colors, the boa-con : 
strictor hoses, the twinkling brass. 

"I'm thinking of our last job," 
said Mr. Montag. 

"Don't," said Leahy, the fire 
chief. 

"That poor man, when we 
burned his library. How would it 
feel if firemen burned our houses 
and our books?" 

"We haven't any books." 

"But if we did have some." 

"You got some?" 

"No." 

Montag gazed beyond them to 
the wall and the typed lists of a 
million forbidden books. The titles 
cringed in fire, burning down the 
years under his ax and his fire hose 
spraying not water but — kerosene. 

"Was it always like this?" asked 
Mr. Montag. "The fire house, our 
duties? I mean, well, once upon a 
time . . ." 

"Once upon a time!" Leahy 
crowed. "What kind of language is 
that?" 

Fool, cried Montag to himself. 
You'll give yourself away! That last 
fire. A book of fairy tales. He had 
dared to read a line or so. "I mean," 
he said, quickly, "in the old days, 
before homes were completely fireproof, didn't firemen ride to fires 
to put them out, instead of start 
them?" 

"I never knew that." Stoneman 
and Black drew forth their rule 
books and laid them where Montag, though long familiar with 
them, might read: 



1. Answer the alarm quickly. 

2. Start the fire swiftly. 

3. Be sure you burn everything. 

4. Report back to fire house. 

5. Stand alert for another 
alarm: 

Everyone watched Montag. 

He swallowed. "What will they 
do to that old man we caught last 
night with his books?" 

"Insane asylum." 

"But he wasn't insane!" 

"Any man is who thinks he can 
hide books from the Government 
or. us." Leahy blew a great fiery 
cloud of cigar smoke from his thin 
mouth. He idled back. 

The alarm sounded. 

The bell kicked itself two hundred times in a few seconds. Suddenly there were three empty chairs. 
The cards fell in a snow flurry. 
The brass pole trembled. The men 
were gone, their hats with them. 
Montag still sat. Below, the orange 
dragon coughed to life. 

Montag slid down the pole like . 
a man in a dream. 

"Montag, you forgot your hat!" 

He got it and they were off, the 
night wind hammering about their 
siren noise and their mighty metal 
thunder. 

IT WAS a flaking three-story 
house in the old section of town. 
A century old if it was a day, but, 
like every house, it had been given 
a thin fireproof plastic coat fifty 



6 




 



years ago, and this preservative shell 
seemed to be holding it up. 
"Here we are!" 

The engine slammed to a stop. 
Leahy, Stoneman, and Black ran up 
the sidewalk, suddenly odious and 
fat in their plump slickers. Montag 
followed. 

They crashed the front door and 
caught a woman, running. 

"I didn't hurt anyone!" she 
cried. 

"Where are they?" Leahy twisted her wrist. 

"You wouldn't take an old woman's pleasures from her, would 
you?" 

Stoneman produced the telephone alarm card with the complaint signed in facsimile duplicate 
on the back. "Says here, Chief, the 
books are. in the attic." 

"All right, men, let's get 'em!" 

Next thing they were up in 
musty blackness, swinging silver 
hatchets at doors that were, after 
all, unlocked, tumbling through like 
boys all rollick and shout. 

"Hey!" 

A fountain of books sprayed 
down on Montag as he climbed 
shuddering up the steep stair well. 
Books bombarded his shoulders, his 
pale face. A book lit, almost obediently, like a white pigeon, in his 
hands, wings fluttering. In the dim, 
wavering light a page hung open 
and it was like a snowy feather, the 
words delicately painted thereon. In 
all the rush and fervor, Montag 
had only an instant to read a line, 



but it blazed in his mind for the 
next minute as if stamped there 
with a fiery iron. He dropped the 
book. Immediately, another fell into 
his arms. 

"Montag, come on up!" 

Montag's hand closed like a trap, 
crushed the book with wild devotion, with an insanity of mindlessness to his chest. The men above 
were hurling shovelfuls of literature into the dusty air. They fell 
like slaughtered birds and the wo" man stood like a small girl among 
the bodies. 

"Montag!" 

He climbed up into the attic. 
" 'This too shall pass away.' " 
"What?" Leahy glared at him. 
Montag froze, blinking. "Did I 
say something?" 

"Move, you idiot!" 

THE books lay in piles like fishes 
left to dry. 
"Trash! Trash!" The men danced 
on the books. Titles glittered their 
golden eyes, falling, gone. 
"Kerosene!" 

They pumped the cool fluid from 
the white snake they had twined 
upstairs. They coated every book; 
they pumped rooms full of it. 

"This is better than the old man's 
place last night, eh?" 

That had not been as much fun. 
The old man had lived in an apartment house with other people. They 
had had to use controlled fire there. 
Here, they could ravage the entire 
' house.

They ran downstairs, Montag 
reeling after them in the kerosene 
fumes. 

"Come on, woman!" 

"My books," she said, quietly. 
She knelt among them to touch the 
drenched leather, to read the gilt 
titles with her fingers instead of 
her eyes, while her eyes accused 
Montag. 

"You can't take my books," she 
said. 

"You know the law," said Leahy. 
"'Pure nonsense, all of it. No two 
books alike, none agreeing. Confusion. Stories about people who 
never existed. Come on, now." 

"No," she said. 

"The whole house'll burn." 

"I won't go." 

The three men walked clumsily 
to the door. They glanced back at 
Montag who stood near the woman. 

"You're not leaving her here?" 
he protested. 

"She won't come." 

"But she's got to!" 

Leahy raised his hand. It contained the concealed igniter to start 
the fire. "Got to get back to the 
station. Besides, she'd cost us a 
trial, money, jail." 

Montag placed his hand around 
the woman's elbow. "You can-come 
with me." 

"No." She actually focused her 
eyes on him for a moment. "Thank 
you, anyway." 

"I'm counting to ten," said 
Leahy. "One, two . . ." 

"Please," said Montag. 

8 



"Go on," said the woman. 

"Three," said Leahy. 

"Come." Montag pulled at her. 

"I want to stay here," she replied, quietly. 

"Four . . . five . . ." 

The woman twisted. Montag 
slipped on an oily book and fell. 
The woman ran up the stairs half 
way and stood there with the books 
at her feet. 

"Six . . . seven . . . Montag," 
said Leahy. 

Montag did not move. He looked 
out the door at that man there with 
the pink face, pink and burned and 
shiny from too many fires, pink 
from night excitements, the pink 
face of Mr. Leahy with the igniter 
poised in his pink fingers. 

Montag felt the book hidden 
against his pounding chest. 

"Go get him!" ordered Leahy. 




HE men dragged Montag yelling from the house. 



Leahy backed out after them, 
leaving a kerosene trail down the 
walk. When they were a hundred 
feet away, Montag was still shout- . 
ing and kicking. He glanced wildly 
back. 

In the front door where she had 
come to gaze out at them quietly, 
her quietness a condemnation, staring straight into Leahy's eyes, was 
the woman. 

Leahy twitched his finger to ignite 
the fuel. 

He was too late. Montag 
gasped. 


 



I 



The woman in the door, reaching with contempt toward them all, 
struck a match against the saturated 
wood. 

People ran out of houses all down 
the street. 

"TT7HO is it?" 

VV "Who would it be?" 
said Mr. Montag, leaning back 
against the closed door in the dark. 

His wife said, at last, "Well, put 
on the light." 

"I don't want the light," he said. 

"Come to bed." 

He heard her roll impatiently; 
the springs squeaked. "Are you 
drunk?" 

He worked out of his coat and 
let it slump to the floor. He held 
his pants out into an abyss and let 
them fall forever and forever into 
darkness. 

His wife said, "What are you 
doing?" 

He balanced in space with the 
book in his sweating, icy hand. 

A minute later, she said, "Well, 
don't just stand there in the middle 
of the room." 

He made a small sound. 

"What?" she asked. 

He made more soft sounds. He 
stumbled toward the bed and 
shoved the book clumsily under the 
cold pillow. He fell into bed and 
his wife cried out, startled. He lay 
separate from her. She talked to him 
for what seemed a long while and 
when he didn't reply but only made 
sounds, he felt her hand creep over, 



up along his chest, his throat, his 
chin. Her hand brushed his cheek. 
He knew that she pulled her hand 
away from his cheek wet. 

A long time later when he was 
finally floating into sleep, he heard 
her say, "You smell of kerosene." 

"I always smell of kerosene," he 
mumbled. 

Late in the night he looked over 
at Mildred. She was awake. There 
was a tiny dance of melody in the 
room. She had her thimble-radio 
tamped into her ear, listening, listening to far people in far places, 
her eyes peeled wide at deep ceilings of blackness. Many nights in 
the last ten years he had £pund her 
with her eyes open, like a dead 
woman. She would lie that way, 
blankly, hour upon hour, and then 
rise and go soundlessly to the bath. 
You could hear faucet water run, 
the tinkle of the sedatives bottle, 
and Mildred gulping hungrily, 
frantically, at sleep. 

She was awake now. In a moment she would rise and go for the 
barbiturates. 

"Mildred," he thought. 

And suddenly she was so strange 
that he couldn't believe that he 
knew her at all. He was in someone 
else's house, like those jokes men 
told about the gentleman, drunk 
on life, who had come home late 
at night, unlocked the wrong door, 
entered a wrong room. And now 
here Montag lay in the strange 
night by this unidentified body he 
had never seen before.

"Millie?" he called. 
"What!" 

"I didn't mean to startle you. 
What 1 want to know is, when did 
we meet? And where?" 

"For what?" 

"I mean originally." 

She was frowning in the dark. 

HE CLARIFIED it. "The first 
time we ever met, where was 
it, and when?" 

"Why, it was at . . ." 
She stopped. 
"I don't know." 
He was frightened. "Can't you 
remember?" 
They both tried. 
"It's been so long." 
"Only ten years. We're both only 
thirty!" 

"Don't ,get excited, I'm trying 
to think." She laughed a strange 
laugh. "How funny, not to remember where or when you met your 
husband or wife." 

He lay with his eyes tight, pressing, massaging his brow. It was 
suddenly more important than any 
other thing in a lifetime that he 
knew where he had met Mildred. 

"It doesn't matter." She was up, 
in the bathroom now. He heard the 
water rushing, the swallowing 
sound. 

"No, I guess not," he murmured. 

And he wondered, did she take 
twenty tablets now, like a year ago, 
when we had to pump her stomach, 
and me shouting to keep her awake, 
walking her, asking her why she 



did it, why she wanted to die, and 
she saying she didn't know, she 
didn't know, she didn't know anything about anything! 

She didn't bejong to him; he 
didn't belong to her. She didn't 
know herself, him, or anyone; the 
world didn't need her, she didn't 
need herself, and in the hospital he 
had realized that if she died he 
would not cry. For it was the dying 
of an unknown, a street face, a face 
in the newspaper) and it was suddenly so wrong that he had begun 
to cry, not at death but at the 
thought of not crying at death, a 
silly empty man beside an empty 
woman while the doctors emptied 
her still more. 

And why are we empty, lonely, 
and not in love? he had asked himself, a year ago. 

They were never together. There 
was always something between, a 
radio, a televisor, a car, a plane, a 
game, nervous exhaustion, or, simply, a little pheno-barbitol. They 
didn't know each other; they knew 
things, inventions. They had applauded science while" it had built 
a beautiful glass structure, a glittering miracle of contraptions about 
them, and, too late, they had found 
it to be a glass wall. They could 
not shout through the wall; they 
could only pantomime silently, 
never touching, hearing, barely seeing each other. 

Looking at Mildred at the hospital, he had thought, does it matter 
if we live of die?

That might not have been 
enough if the people" had not moved 
next door with their daughter. 

Perhaps that had been the start 
of his awareness of his job, his 
marriage, his life. 

ONE night — it was so long ago — 
he had gone out for a long 
walk. In the moonlight, he realized 
that he had come out to get away 
from the nagging of his wife's television set. He walked, hands in 
pockets, blowing steam from his 
mouth into the cold air. 

"Alone," He looked at the avenues ahead. "By God, I'm alone. 
Not another pedestrian in miles." 
He walked swiftly down street after 
street. "Why, I'm the only pedestrian in the entire city!" The 
streets were empty and long and 
quiet. Distantly, on crosstown arteries, a few cars moved in the dark. 
But no other man ventured upon 
the earth to test the use of his legs. 
In fact, it had been so many years 
since the sidewalks were used that 
they were buckling, becoming obscured with grass. 

So he walked alone, aware of 
his loneliness, until the police car 
pulled up and flashed its cold white 
light upon him. 

"What're you doing?" shouted a 
voice. 

"I'm out for a walk." 

"He says he's out for a walk." 

The laughter, the cold, precise 
turning over of his identity cards, 
the careful noting of his address. 



"Okay, mister, you can walk 
now." 

He had gone on, stomping his 
feet, jerking his mouth and hands, 
eyes blazing, gripping his elbows. 
"The nerve! The nerve! Is there a 
law against pedestrians!" 

The girl turned a corner and 
walked toward him. 
. She stopped and glanced at him. 

"Why, hello," she said, and put 
out her hand. "You're my neighbor, aren't you?" 

"Am I?" he said. 

She was smiling quietly. "We're 
the only live ones, aren't we?" She 
waved at the empty sidewalks. "Did 
the police stop you, too?" 

"Walking's a crime." 

"They flashed their lights on me, 
but saw I was a woman — " She 
was no more than sixteen, Montag 
estimated, with eyes and hair as 
dark as mulberries, and a paleness 
about her that was not illness but 
radiance. "Then they drove away. 
I'm Clarisse McClellan. And you're 
Mr. Montag, the fireman." 

They walked together. And she 
began to talk for both of them. 

"It's a graveyard, this town," she 
said. "I like to walk just to keep 
my franchise on the sidewalks." 

He looked and it was true. The 
city was like a dark tomb, every 
house deep in television dimness, 
not a sound or move anywhere. 

<<TTAVE you ever noticed all the 
J- J- cars rushing?" she asked. 
"On the big boulevards down that

way, day and night. I sometimes 
think they don't know what grass 
is, or flowers, because they never 
see them slowly. If you showed 
them a green blur, oh, yes! they'd 
say, that's grass! A pink blur, yes, 
that's roses!" She laughed to herself. "A white blur's a house. Quick 
brown blurs are cows. My uncle 
drove slow on a highway once. 
They threw him in jail. Isn't that 
funny and sad, too?" 

"You think of a lot of things for 
a girl," said Montag, uneasily. 

"That's because I've got time to 
think. I never watch t-v or go to 
games or races or funparks. So I've 
lots of time for crazy thoughts, I 
guess. Have you seen the two hundred-foot-long billboards in the 
country? Well, did you know that 
once billboards were only twentyfive feet long? But cars started going by so quickly, they had to 
stretch the advertising out so it 
could be seen." 

"I didn't know that." Montag 
laughed abruptly. 

"Bet I know something else you 
don't." 

"What?" 

"There's d ew on the grass in the 
morning." 

He couldn't remember, and suddenly it frightened him. 

"And, if you look, there's a man 
in the moon." 

He had never looked. His heart 
- beat rapidly. 

They walked the rest of the way 
in silence. When they reached her 



house, its lights were all blazing. It 
was the only house, in a city of a 
million houses, with its lights burning brightly. 

"What's going on?" Montag had 
never seen that many house lights. 

"Oh, just my mother and father 
and uncle sitting around, talking. 
It's like being a pedestrian, only 
rarer." 

"But what do they talk about?" 

She laughed at this, said good 
night, and was gone. 

At three in the cold morning, 
he got out of bed and stuck his 
head out the front window. The 
moon was rising and there was a 
man in the moon. Over the broad 
lawn, a million jewels of dew 
sparkled. 

"I'll be damned," said Montag, 
and went back to bed. 

HE SAW Clarisse many afternoons and came to hope he 
would be seeing her, found himself 
watching for her sitting on her 
green lawn, studying the autumn 
leaves with a fine casual air, or returning from a distant woods with 
wild yellow flowers, or looking at 
the sky, even while it was raining. 
"Isn't rain nice?" she said. 
"I hadn't noticed." 
"Believe me, it is nice." 
He always laughed embarrassedly. Whether at her, or at himself, 
he wasn't sure. "I believe you." 

"Do you really? Did you ever 
smell old leaves? Don't they smell 
like cinnamon? Here!" 



12 




 



"Why, it is cinnamon, yes!" 

She gazed at him with her clear 
dark eyes. "My gosh, you don't 
really know very much, do you?" 
She was not unkind, just concerned 
for him. 

"I don't suppose any of us know 
much." 

"I do," she said, quietly, "because I've time to look." 

"Don't you attend school?" 

"Oh, no. They say I'm anti-social. 
I don't mix. And the yelling bully 
is the thing among kids this season, 
you know." 

"It's been a long season," observed Montag, and stood somewhat shocked at his own perception. 

"Then you've noticed?" 

"Yes. But what about your 
friends?" 

"I haven't any. That's supposed 
to prove I'm abnormal. But they're 
always packed around the t-v, or 
racing in cars, or shouting or beating one another. Do you notice how 
people hurt one another nowadays?" 

"You sound ancient." 

"I am. I know about rain. That 
makes me ancient to them. They 
kill each other. It didn't used to be 
that way, did it? Children killing 
each other all the time? Four of 
my friends have been shot in the 
past year. I'm afraid of children." 

"Maybe it was always this way." 

"My father says his grandfather 
remembered when children didn't 
kill each other, when children were 



seen and not heard. But that was a 
long time ago, when they had discipline and responsibility. Do you 
know, I'm disciplined? I'm spanked 
when I need it, and I've responsibility. I do all the shopping and 
housecleaning. ^By hand." 

"And you know about rain," said 
Mr. Montag, with the rain beating 
on his hat and coat. 

"It tastes good if you lean back 
and open your mouth. Go on." 

He leaned back and gaped. 

"Why," he said, "it's wine." 

THAT had not been the end of 
it. The girl had talked to him 
one bright afternoon and given him 
the dandelion test. 

"It proves you're in love or not." 
She brushed a dandelion under 
his chin. 

"What a shame! You're not in 
love with anyone." 

And he thought, when did I 
stop loving Mildred? and the answer was never! for he had never 
known her. She was the pale, sad 
goldfish that swam in the subterranean illumination of the television parlor; her natural habitat. 

"It's the dandelion you use," 
protested Montag. 

"No," said Clarisse, solemnly. 
"You're not in love. A dandelion 
won't help." She tossed the flower 
away. "Well, I've got to go see 
my psychiatrist. My teachers are 
sending me to him. He's trying to 
make me normal." 

"I'll throttle him if he does!" 



THE FIREMAN

"Right now he's trying to figure 
out why I go away from the city 
and walk in the forests once a day. 
Have you ever walked in a forest? 
No? It's so quiet and lovely, and 
nobody rushing. I like to watch the 
birds and the insects. They don't 
rush:" 

Before she left him to go inside, 
she looked at him suddenly and 
said, "Do you know, Mr. Montag, 
> I can't believe you're a fireman." 

"Why not?" 

"Because you're so nice. Do you 
mind if I ask one last question?" 

"I don't mind." 

"Why do you do what you do?" 

But before he knew what she 
meant or could make a reply, she 
had run off, embarrassed at her own 
frankness. 

"What did she mean, why do I 
do what I do?" he said to himself. 
"I'm a fireman, of course. I burn 
books. Is that what she meant?" 

He didn't see Clarisse for a 
month. He watched for her every 
day, but made no point of her absence to his wife. He wanted to go 
rap on her parents' door, but decided against it; he didn't want 
them misunderstanding his interest 
in the child. But after thirty-six 
days had passed, he brought Clarisse's name up offhand. 

"Oh, her?" said Mildred, with 
the radio music jarring the table 
plates. "Why, didn't you know?" 

"Know what?" 

"She was killed by an automobile 
a month ago." 



"A month! But why didn't 
someone tell me?" 

"Didn't I? I suppose it slipped 
my mind. Yes, a car hit her." 

"Did they find whose car it 
was ?" 

"No. You know how those things 
are. What do you want for supper, 
frozen steak or chops?" 

AND so Clarisse was dead. No, 
disappeared! for in a large 
city you didn't die, you simply vanished. No one missed you, no one 
saw you go; your death was as insignificant as that of a butterfly 
carried secretly away, caught in the 
radiator grille of a speeding car. 

And with Clarisse's death, half 
of the world was dead, and the 
other half was instantly revealed to 
him for what it was. 

He saw what Mildred was and 
always would be, what he himself 
was but didn't want to be any more. 
And he saw that it was no idle 
thing, Mildred's suicidal attempts, 
the lovely dark girl with the flowers being ground under a car; it was 
a thing of the world they lived in. 
It was a part of the screaming, 
pressing down of people into electric molds. It was the meaningless 
flight of civilization down a rotary 
track to smash its own senseless 
tail. Mildred's flight was trying to 
die and escape nothingness, whereas 
Clarisse had been fighting nothingness with something, with being 
aware instead of forgetting, with 
walking instead of sitting, with go


14 




 



ing to get life instead of having it 
brought to her. 

And this civilization had killed 
her for her trouble. Not purposely, 
no, but with a fine ironic sense; for 
no purpose at all. Killed by a 
vanilla-faced idiot racing nowhere 
for nothing and irritated that he 
had been detained 120 seconds 
while the police investigated and 
released him on his way to some 
distant base which he must tag frantically before running for home. 

Montag felt the slow gathering 
of awareness. Mildred. Clarisse. 
The firemen. The murdering children. Last night, the old man's 
books burned and him in an asylum. 
Tonight, that woman burned before his eyes. It was such a nightmare that only another nightmare, 
less horrible, could be used to 
escape from it, and Clarisse had 
died weeks ago and he had not 
seen her die, which made it somehow cruder and yet more bearable. 

"Clarisse. Clarisse." 

Montag lay all night long, thinking, smelling the smoke on his 
hands, in the dark. 

HE HAD chills and fever in the 
morning. 
"You can't be sick," said Mildred. 

He closed his eyes upon the 
hotness. "Yes." 

"But you were all right last 
night." 

"No, I wasn't all right." He 
heard the radio in the parlor. 

THE FIREMAN 



Mildred stood over his bed, 
curiously. He felt her there; he saw 
her without opening his eyes, her 
hair burned by chemicals to a brittle 
straw, her eyes with a kind of mental cataract unseen but suspect far 
behind the pupils, the reddened 
pouting lips, the body as thin as a 
praying mantis from dieting, and 
her flesh like raw milk. He could 
remember her no other way. 

"Will you bring me an analgesic 
and water?" 

"You've got to get up," she said. 
"It's noon. You've slept five hours 
later than usual." 

"Will you turn the radio off?" 
he asked. 

"That's my favorite program." 

"Will you rum it off for a sick 
man ?" 

"I'll turn it down." 

She went out of the room and 
did nothing to the radio and came 
back. "Is that better?" 

"Thanks." 

"That's my favorite program," 
she repeated, as if she had not said 
it a thousand times before. 

"What about the analgesic?" 

"You've never been sick before." 
She went away again. 

"Well, I'm sick now. I'm not 
going to work tonight. Call Leahy 
for me." 

"You acted funny last night." 
She returned, humming. 

"Where's the analgesic?" He 
glanced at the water glass. 

"Oh." She walked to the bath 
again. "Did something happen?" 

IS 



"A fire, that's all." 
"I had a nice evening," she said, 
in the bathroom. 
"What doing?" 
"Television." 
"What was on?" 
"Programs." 
"What programs?" 
"Some of the best ever." 
"Who?" 

"Oh, you know, the big shows." 

"Yes, the big shows, big, big, 
big." He pressed at the pain in his 
eyes and suddenly the odor of kerosene made him vomit. 

Mildred came in, humming. She 
was surprised. "Why'd you do 
that?" 

He looked with dismay at the 
floor. "We burned an old woman 
with her books." 

"It's a good thing the rug's 
washable." She fetched a mop and 
swabbed clumsily at it. "I went to 
Helen's last night." 

"Couldn't you get the shows on 
your own t-v?" 

"Sure, but it's nice visiting." 

"Did Helen get over that finger 
infection?" 
' "I didn't notice." 

SHE went out into the living 
room. He heard her by the 
radio, singing. 

"Mildred?" he called. 
She returned, singing, snapping 
her fingers softly. 

"Aren't you going to ask me 
about last night?" he said. 
"What about it?" 



"We burned a thousand • books 
and a woman." 

"Forbidden books." 

The radio was exploding in the 
parlor. 

"Yes. Copies of Plato and Socrates and Marcus Aurelius." 

"Foreigners?" 

"Something like that." 

"Then they were radicals." 

"All foreigners can't be radicals." 

"If they wrote books, they were." 
Mildred fiddled with the telephone. 
"You don't expect me to call Mr. 
Leahy, do you?" 

"You must!" 

"Don't shout." 

"I wasn't shouting!" He was up 
in bed, suddenly, enraged and 
flushed, shaking. The radio roared 
in the hot air. "I can't call him. I 
can't tell him I'm sick." 

"Why?" 

Because you're afraid, he thought, 
pretending illness, afraid to call. 
Leahy because after a moment's discussion the conversation would run 
so: "Yes, Mr. Leahy, I feel better 
already. I'll be in at ten o'clock 
tonight." 

"You're not sick," said Mildred 

Montag fell back in bed. He 
reached under his pillow and 
groped for the hidden book. It 
was still there. 

"Mildred, how would it be if — 
well, maybe I quit my job a. while?" 

"You want to give up everything? After all these years of 
working, because, one night, some 
woman and her books — "

"You should have seen her, 
Millie!" 

"She's nothing to me. She 
shouldn't have had books. It was 
her responsibility; she should've 
thought of that. I hate her. She's 
got you going and next thing you 
know we'll be out, no house, no 
job, nothing." 

"You weren't there, you didn't 
see," he said. "There must be 
something in books, whole worlds 
we don't dream about, to make a 
woman stay in a burning house. 
There must be something fine 
there. You don't stay and burn for 
nothing." 

"She was simple-minded." 

"She was as rational as you or I, 
more so, and we burned her." 

"That's water under the bridge." 

"No, not water, Millie, but fire. 
You ever seen a burned house? It 
smolders for days. Well, this fire'll 
last me half a century. My God, 
I've been trying to put it out, in 
my mind, all night, and I'm crazy 
with trying." 

"You should've thought of that 
before becoming a fireman." 

"IT1HOUGHT!" he said. "Was I 
JL given a choice? I was raised 
to think the best thing in the world 
is not to r^ad. The best thing is 
television and radio and ball games 
and a home I can't afford and, Good 
Lord, now, only now I realize what 
I've done. My grandfather and 
father were firemen. Walking in 
my sleep, I followed them." 



The radio was playing a dance 
tune. 

"I've been killing the brain of 
the world for ten years, pouring 
kerosene on it. Millie, a book is a 
brain. It isn't only that woman we 
destroyed, or others like her, in 
these years, but it's the thoughts I 
burned and never knew it." 

He got out of bed. 

"It took some man a lifetime to 
put some of his thoughts on paper, 
looking after all the beauty and 
goodness in life, and then we come 
along in two minutes and heave it 
in the incinerator!" 

"Let me alone," said Mildred. 

"Let you alone!" He almost cried 
out with laughter. "Letting you 
alone is easy, but how can I leave 
myself alone? That's what's wrong. 
We need not to be let alone. We 
need to be upset and stirred and 
bothered, once in a while, anyway. 
Nobody bothers any more. Nobody 
thinks. Let a baby alone, why don't 
you? What would you have in 
twenty years? A savage, unable to 
think or talk — like us!" ' 

Mildred glanced out the window. 
"Now you've done it. Look who's 
here." 

"I don't give a damn." He was 
feeling better but didn't know 
why. 

"It's Mr. Leahy." 

The elation drained away. Mr. 
Montag slumped. 

"Go open the door," he said, at 
last. "Tell him I'm sick." 

"Tell him yourself." 



THE FIREMAN

He made sure the book was 
hidden behind the pillow, climbed 
back into bed, and had made himself tremblingly- uncomfortable, 
when the door opened and Mr. 
Leahy strolled in, hands in pockets. 

"Shut the radio off," said Leahy, 
abstractedly. 

This time, Mildred obeyed. 

Mr. Leahy sat down in a comfortable chair with a look of strange 
peace in his pink face. He did not 
look at Montag. 

"Just thought I'd come by and 
see how the sick man is." 

"How'd you guess?" 

"Oh." Leahy smiled his pink 
smile, and shrugged. "I'm an old 
hand at this. I've seen it all. You 
were going to call me and tell me 
you needed a day off." 

"Yes." 

"TT7ELL, take a day off," said 
VV Leahy, looking at his 
hands. He carried an eternal match 
with him at times in a little case 
which said, Guaranteed: One Million Cigarels Can Be Lit with this 
Match, and kept striking this abstractedly against its case as he 
talked. "Take a day off. Take two. 
But never take three." He struck 
the match and looked at the flame 
and blew it out. "When will you 
be well?" 

"Tomorrow, the next day, first of 
the week, I . . ." 

"We've been wondering about 
you." Leahy put a cigar in his 
mouth. "Every fireman goes through 



this. They only need understanding, 
need to know how the wheels run, 
what the history of our profession 
is. They don't give it to rookies any 
more. Only fire chiefs remember it 
now. I'll let you in on it." He lit 
the cigar leisurely. 

Mildred fidgeted. 

"You ask yourself about the 
burning of books, why, how, 
when." Leahy exuded a great gray 
cloud of smoke. 

"Maybe," said Montag. 

"It started around about the 
Civil War, I'd say. Photography 
discovered. Fast printing presses 
coming up. Films at the early part 
of the 20th Century. Radio. Television. Things began to have mass, 
Montag, mass." 

"I see." 

"And because they had mass, 
they became simpler. Books, now. 
Once they appealed to various small 
groups of people, here and there. 
They could afford to be different. 
The world was roomy. But then the 
world got full of mass and elbows. 
Films and radios and magazines and 
books had to level down to a sort 
of paste- pudding norm. Do you 
follow me?" 

"I think so." 

Leahy ' looked through a veil of 
smoke, not at Montag, but at the 
thing he was describing. "Picture 
it. The 19th Century man with his 
horses, dogs, and slow living. You 
might call him a slow motion man. 
Then in the 20th Century you speed 
up the camera."

"A good analogy." 

"Splendid. Books get shorter. 
Condensations appear. Digests. 
Tabloids. Radio programs simplify. 
Everything sublimates itself to the 
gag, the snap ending." 

"Snap ending." Mildred nodded 
approvingly. "You should have 
heard last night — " 

"Great classics are cut to fit fifteen minute shows, then two minute book columns, then two line 
digest resumes. Magazines become 
picture books. Out of the nursery 
to the college, back to the nursery, 
in a few short centuries!" 

MILDRED arose. She was losing 
the thread of the talk, Montag knew, and when this happened 
she began to fiddle with things. 
She went about the room, picking 
up. 

"Faster and faster the film, Mr. 
Montag! Quick, Click, Pic, Look. 
Eye, Now/ Flick, Flash, Here, 
There, Sivift, Up, Down, Why, 
How, Who, Eh? Mr. Montag, digest-digests, political affairs in one 
column, a sentence, a headline, and 
then, in mid-air, vanish! The mind 
of man, whirling so fast under the 
pumping hands of publishers, publicists, ad men, broadcasters that the 
centrifuge throws off all ideas! He 
is unable to concentrate!" 

Mildred was smoothing the bed 
now. Montag felt panic as she approached his pillow to straighten it. 
In a moment, with sublime innocence, she would be pulling the 



hidden book out from behind the 
pillow and displaying it as if it 
were a reptile! 

Leahy blew a cumulus of cigar 
smoke at the ceiling. "School is 
shortened, discipline relaxed, philosophies, histories, languages 
dropped, English and spelling neglected, finally ignored. Life is 
immediate. The job counts. Why 
learn anything save pressing buttons, pulling switches, fitting 
bolts?" 

"Let me fix your pillow," said 
Mildred, being the video housewife. 

"No," whispered Montag. 

"The zipper replaces the button. 
Does a man have time to think 
while dressing in the morning, a 
philosophical time?" 

"No," said Montag, automatically. 

Mildred tugged at the pillow. 

"Get away," said Montag. 

"Life becomes one big Prat Fall, 
Mr. Montag. No more ' subtleties. 
Everything is bang and boff and 
wow!" 

"Wow," reflected Mildred, yanking the pillow edge. 

"For God's sake, let me be!" 
cried Montag, passionately. 

Leahy stared. 

Mildred's hand was frozen behind the pillow. Her hand was on 
the book, her face stunned, her 
mouth opening to ask a question . . . 

"Theaters stand empty, Mr. 
Montag, replaced by television and 



THE FIREMAN

baseball and sports where nobody 
has to think at all, not at all, at 
all." Now Leahy was almost invisible, a voice somewhere back of 
a choking screen of cigar smoke. 

"What's this?" asked Mildred, 
with delight, almost. Montag 
crushed and heaved back against 
her hands. "What've you hid 
there?" 

"Sit down!" Montag screamed. 
She jumped back, her hands 
empty. "We're talking!" 

LEAHY continued, mildly. "Cartoons everywhere. Books become cartoons. The mind drinks 
less and less. Impatience. Time to 
kill. No work, all leisure. Highways 
full of crowds going somewhere, 
anywhere, nowhere. The gasoline 
refugee, towns becoming motels, 
people in nomadic surges from city 
to city, impatient, following the 
moon tides, living tonight in the 
room where you slept last night and 
I the night before." 

Mildred went into the other 
room and slammed the door. She 
turned on the radio. 
"Go on," said Montag. 
"Intelligent writers gave up in 
disgust. Magazines were vanilla 
tapioca. The book buyer, bored by 
dishwater, his brain spinning, quit 
buying. Everyone but the comicpublisher died a slow publishing 
death. There you have it. Don't 
blame the Government. Technology, mass exploitation, and censorship from frightened officials did 



the trick. Today, thanks to them, 
you can read comics, confessions, 
or trade journals, nothing else. All 
the rest is dangerous." 

"Yes, but why the firemen?" 
asked Montag.' 

"Ah," said Leahy, leaning forward in the clouds of smoke to 
finish. "With schools turning out 
doers instead of thinkers, with nonreaders, naturally, in ignorance, 
they hated and feared books. You 
always fear an unfamiliar thing. 
'Intellectual' became a swear word. 
Books were snobbish things. 

"The little man wants you and 
me to be like him. Not everyone 
born free and equal, as the Constitution says, but everyone made 
equal. A book is a loaded gun in 
the house next door. Burn it. Take 
the shot out of the weapon. Unbreach men's minds. Who knows 
who might be the target of the 
well-read man? And so, when 
houses became all fireproof and 
there was no longer need of firemen 
for protection, they were given the 
new job, as official censors, judges, 
jurors, punishers. That's you, Mr. 
Montag, and me." 

Leahy stood up. "I've got to get 
going." 

Montag lay back in bed. "Thanks 
for explaining it to me." 

"You must understand our civilization is so vast that we can't have 
our minorities upset and stirred. 
People must be contented. Books 
bother them. Colored people don't 
like Little Black Sambo. We burn 



20 




 



it. White people don't like Uncle 
■ Tom's Cabin. Burn it, too. Anything for serenity." 

Leahy shook Montag's limp 
hand. 

"Oh, one last thing. Once in his 
career, every fireman gets curious. 
What do the books say, he wonders. A good question. Well, they 
say nothing, Mr. Montag. Nothing 
you can touch or believe in. They're 
about non-existent people, figments. 
Not to be trusted. But anyway, say, 
a fireman 'takes' a book, at a fire, 
almost by 'accident.' A natural 
error." 

"Natural." 

"We allow that. We let him 
keep it 24 hours. If he hasn't 
burned it by then, we burn it for 
him.' 

"I see," said Montag. His throat 
was dry. 

"You'll be at work tonight at 
six - o'clock?" 

"No." 

"What!" 

Montag shut his eyes. "I'll be 
in later, maybe." 

"See that you do." 

"I'll never come in again!" 
yelled Montag, but only in his 
mind. 

"Get well." 

Leahy, trailing smoke, went out. 

MONTAG watched through the 
front window as Leahy drove 
away in his gleaming beetle which 
was the color of the last fire they 
had set. 



Mildred had turned on the afternoon television show and was staring into the shadow screen. 

Montag cleared his throat, but 
she didn't look up. 

"It's only a step," he said, "from 
not working today, to not working 
tomorrow, to not working ever 
again." 

"You're going to work tonight, 
though ?" 

"I'm doing more than that," he 
said. "I'm going to start to kill 
people and rave, and buy books!" 

"A one-man revolution," said 
Mildred, lightly, turning to look at 
him. "They'd put you in jail, 
wouldn't they?" 

"That's not a bad idea. The best 
people are there." He put his 
clothes on, furiously, walking 
about the bedroom. "But I'd kill a 
few people before I did get locked 
up. There's a real bastard, that 
Leahy. Did you hear him! Knows 
all the answers, but does nothing 
about it!" 

"I won't even listen to all this 
junk," said Mildred. 

"No?" he said. "This is your 
house as well as mine, isn't it?" 

"Yes." 

"Then I have something I want 
you to see, something I put away 
and never looked at again during 
the past year, not even knowing 
why I put them away and hid them 
and kept them and never told you." 

He dragged a chair into the hall, 
climbed up on it, and opened an 
air-vent. Reaching up, he began 



THE FIREMAN 



21 



throwing books, big ones, little 
ones, red, yellow, green books, 
twenty, thirty, fifty books, one by 
one, swiftly, into the parlor at her 
feet. "There!" 

"Leonard Montag! You didn't!" 

"So you're not in this with me? 
You're in it up to your neck!" 

She backed away as if she were 
surrounded by a pack of terrible 
rats. Her face was paled out and 
her eyes were fastened wide and 
she was breathing as if someone 
had struck her in the stomach. 
"They'll burn our house. They'll 
kill us." 

"Let them try." 

She hesitated; then, moaning, she 
seized a book and ran toward the 
fireplace. 

He caught her. "No, Millie! No! 
Never touch my books. Never. Or, 
by God, if you do, touch just one 
of them meaning to burn it, believe me, Millie, I'll kill you." 

"Leonard Montag! You wouldn't!" 

HE SHOOK her. "Listen," he 
pleaded down into her face. 
He held her shoulders firmly, while 
her face bobbed helplessly, and 
tears sprang from her eyes. 

"You must help me," he said, 
slowly, trying to find his way into 
her thinking. "You're in this now, 
whether you like it or not. I've 
never asked for anything in my life 
of you, but I ask it now, I plead it. 
We must start somewhere. We're 
going to read books. It's a thing 



we haven't done and must do. 
We've got to know what these 
books are so we can tell others, and 
so that, eventually, they can tell 
everyone. Sit down now, Millie, 
there, right there. I'll help you, 
we'll help each other. Between us, 
we'll do something to destroy men 
like Leahy and Stoneman and 
Black and myself, and this world 
we live in, and put it all back together a different way. Do you 
hear me?" 

"Yes." Her body sagged. 

The doorbell rang. 

They jerked about to stare at the 
door and the books toppled everywhere, everywhere in heaps. 

"Leahy!" 

"It can't be him!" 
"He's come back!" sobbed Mildred. 

The bell rang again. 

"Let him stand out there. We 
won't answer." Montag reached 
blindly for a book on the floor, 
any book, any beginning, any start, 
any beauty at all would do. He put 
the book into Mildred's shaking 
hands. 

The bell rang a third time, insistently. 

"Read." He quivered a hand to 
a page. "Out loud." 

Mildred's eyes were on the door 
and the bell rang angrily, loudly, 
again and again. "He'll come ia," 
she said, "oh, God, and set fire to 
everything, and us." 

But at last she found the line, 
with Montag standing over her, 



22 




 



swaying, any line in the book, and 
after trying it four times, she began to fumble out the words of a 
poem printed there on the white, 
unburned paper: 

"And evening vanish and no more, 
The low pale light across the 

the land — " 
The bell rang. 
"Nor now the long light on the 

sea — 

And here face downward in the 
sun . . ." 
Another ring. 

Montag whispered. "He'll go 
away in a minute." 

Mildred's lips trembled: 
"To feel how swift, how secretly 
The shadow of the night comes 
on . . ." 

Near the ceiling, smoke from 
Leahy's cigar still lingered. 

II 

The Sieve and the Sand 

THEY read the long afternoon through, while the fire 
flickered and blew on the 
hearth and the October rain fell 
from the sky upon the strangely 
quiet house. Now and again, Mr. 
Montag would silently pace the 
room, or bring in a bottle of cold 
beer and drink it easily or say, 
"Will you read that part over 
again? Isn't that an idea now?" 
And Mildred's voice, as colorless 
as a beer bottle which contains a 



rare and beautiful wine but does 
not know it, went on enclosing the 
words in plain glass, pouring forth 
the beauties with a loose mouth, 
while her drab eyes moved over the 
words and over the words and the 
rain rained and the hour grew late. 

They read a man named Shakespeare and a man named Poe and 
part of a book by a man named 
Matthew and one named Mark. On 
occasion, Mildred glanced fearfully 
at the window. 

"Go on," said Mr. Montag. 

"Someone might be watching. 
That might' ve been Mr. Leahy at 
our door a while back." 

"Whoever it was went away. 
Read that last section again. I want 
to understand that." 

She read from the works of 
Jefferson and Lincoln. 

When it was five o'clock her 
hands dropped open. "I'm tired. 
Can I stop now?" Her voice was 
hoarse. 

"How thoughtless of me." He 
took a book from her. "But isn't 
it beautiful, Millie? The words, 
and the thoughts, • aren't they exciting?" 

"I don't understand any of it." 
"But surely . . ." 
"Just words." 

"But you remember some of it." 
"Nothing." 

"You'll learn. It's difficult at 
first." 

"I don't like books," she said. 
"I don't understand books. They're 
over my head. They're for profes

sors and radicals and I don't want 
to read any more. Please, promise 
you won't make me." * 
"Mildred!" 

"I'm afraid," she said, putting 
her face into her shaking hands. ' 
"I'm so terribly frightened by these 
ideas, by Mr. Leahy, and having 
these books in the house. They'll 
burn our books and kill us. Now, 
I'm sick." 

"I'm sorry," he said at last, sighing. "I've put you on trial, haven't 
I? I'm way out front, trying to drag 
you, when I should be walking beside you, barely touching. I expect 
too much. It'll take months to put 
you in the frame of mind where 
you can receive the ideas in these 
books. It's not fair of me. All right, 
you won't have to read aloud 
again." 

"Thanks." 

"But you must listen. I'll explain." 

"I'll never learn. I just know I 
won't." 

"You must if you want to be 
free." 

"I'm free already. I couldn't be 
freer." 

"You can't be free if you're not 
aware." 

"Why do you want to ruin us* 
with all this?" she asked. 
"Listen," he said. 

SHE listened. 
Jet-bombers were crossing 
the sky over their house. 

Those quick gasps in the 



heavens, as if a running giant had 
drawn his breath. Those sharp, almost quiet whistles, here and gone 
in so much less than an instant that 
one almost believed one had heard 
nothing. And seeing nothing in the 
sky, if you did look, was worse 
than seeing something. There was 
a feeling as if a great invisible fan 
was whirring blade after hostile 
blade across the stars, with giant 
murmurs and no motion, perhaps 
only a faint trembling of starlight. 
All night, every night of their 
lives, they had heard those jet 
sounds and seen nothing, until, like 
the tick of a clock or a time-bomb, 
it had come to be unnoticed, for it 
was the sound of today and the 
sound of today dying, the CheyneStokes respiration of civilization. 

"I want to know why and how 
we are where we are," said Montag. "How did those bombers get 
in the sky every instant? Why have 
there been three semi-atomic wars 
since I960? Where did we take the 
wrong turn ? What can we do about 
it? Only the books know this. Maybe the books can't solve my problem, but they can bring me out in 
the light. And they might stop us 
from going on with the same insane mistakes." 

"You can't stop wars. There've 
always been wars." 

"No, I can't. War's so much a 
part of us now that in the last three 
days, though we're on the very rim 
of war, people hardly mention it. 
Ignoring it, at least, isn't the an

swer. But now, about us. We must 
have a schedule of reading. An hour 
in the morning. An hour or so in 
the afternoon. Two hours in the 
evening — " 

"You're not going to forbid me 
my radio, are you?" Her voice 
rose. 

"Well, to start . . ." 

She was up in a fury, raging at 
him. "I'll sit and listen if you want 
me to for a while every day," she 
cried. "But I've got to have my 
radio programs, too, and every 
night on the t-v — you can't take 
that away from me!" 

"But don't you see? That's the 
very thing I'd like to counteract—" 

The telephone rang. They both 
started. Mildred snatched it up and 
was almost immediately laughing. 
"Hello, Ann. Yes, oh, yes! Tonight, 
you come here. Yes, the White 
Clown's on tonight and the Terror 
will be fun." 

Mr. Montag shuddered, sick. He 
left the room. He walked through 
the house, thinking. 

Leahy, the fire house, these dangerous books. 

"I'll shoot him tonight," he said, 
aloud. "I'll kill Leahy. That'll be 
one censor out of the way. No." 
He laughed coldly. "I'd have to 
shoot most of the people in the 
world. How does one start a revolution? I'm alone. My wife, as the 
saying goes, does not understand 
me. What can a single lonely man 
do?" 



MILDRED was chattering. The 
radio was thundering, turned 
on again. 

And then Mr. Montag remembered; about a month ago, walking 
through the park alone, he had 
come upon a man in a black suit, 
unaware. The man had been reading something. Montag hadn't seen 
a book; he had only seen the man 
move hastily, face flushed. The man 
had jumped up as if to run, and 
Montag had said, simply, "Sit 
down." 

"I didn't do anything." 
"No one said you did." 
They had sat in the park all afternoon. Montag had drawn the man 
out. He was a retired professor of 
English literature, who had lost his 
job forty years before when the last 
college of fine arts had been closed. 
His name was William Faber, and 
shyly, fearfully, he admitted he had 
been reading a little book of American poems, forbidden poems which 
he now produced from his coat 
pocket. 

"Just to know I'm alive," said 
Mr. Faber. "Just to know where I 
am and what things are. To sense 
things. Most of my friends sense 
nothing. Most of them can't talk. 
They stutter and halt and hunt 
words. And what they talk is sales 
and profits and what they saw on 
television the hour before." 

What a nice afternoon that had 
been. Professor Faber had read 
some of the poems to Montag, none 
of which Montag understood, but

ihe sounds were good, and slowly 
the meaning crept in. When it was 
all over, Montag said, "I'm a fireman." 

Faber had looked as if he might 
die on the spot. 

"Don't be afraid. I won't turn 
you In," said Montag hastily. "I 
stopped being mean about it years 
ago. You know, the way you talk 
reminds me of a girl I knew once, 
name of Clarisse. She was killed a 
few months ago by a car. But she 
had me thinking, too. We met each 
other because we took long walks. 
No one walks any more. I haven't 
seen a pedestrian in ten years on 
our street. Are you ever stopped by 
police simply because you're a 
pedestrian ?" 

He and Faber had smiled, exchanged addresses orally, and 
parted. He had never seen Faber 
again. It wouldn't be safe to know 
a former English literature professor. But now . . .? 

He dialed a call. 

"Hello, Professor Faber?" 

"Who is this?" 

"This is Montag. You remember? The park? A month ago?" 

"Yes, Mr. Montag. Can I help 
you?" 

"Mr. Faber." He hesitated. 
"How many copies of the Bible are 
left in the world?" 

"I'm afraid I don't know what 
you're talking about." The voice 
grew cold. 

"I want to know if there are any 
copies at all." 



"I can't discuss such things, Montag." 

"This line is closed. There's no 
one listening." 

"Is this some sort of trap? I 
can't talk to just anyone on the 
phone." 

"Tell me, are there any copies?" 
"None!" And Faber hung up. 
None. 

MONTAG fell back in his 
chair. None! None in all the 
world, none left, none anywhere, 
all, all of them destroyed, torn 
apart, burned. The Bible at last 
dead for all time to the world. 

He got up shakily and walked 
across the room and bent down 
among the books. He took hold of 
one book and lifted it. 

"The old and new testaments, 
Millie! One last copy and we have 
it here!" 

"Fine," ' she said vaguely. 
"Do you realize what it means, 
the importance of this copy here in 
our house? If anything should 
happen to this book, it would be 
lost forever." 

"And you have to hand it back 
to Mr. Leahy tonight to be burned, 
'don't you?" said Mildred. She was 
not being cruel. She was merely 
relieved that the one book, at least, 
was going out of her life. 
"Yes." 

He could see Leahy turning the 
book over with slow appreciation. 
"Sit down, Montag. I want you to 
watch this. Delicately, like a head

of lettuce, see?" Ripping one page 
after another from the binding. 
Lighting the first page with a 
match. And when it had curled 
down into black wings, lighting the 
second page from the first and the 
third from the second, and so on, 
chain-smoking the entire volume 
chapter by printed chapter, all of 
the words and the wisdom. When 
it was finished, with Montag seated 
there sweating, the floor would resemble a swarm of black moths 
that had fluttered and died in one 
small storm. And Leahy smiling, 
washing his hands. 

"My God, Millie, we've got to 
do something! We've got to copy 
this. There must be a duplicate 
made. This can't be lost!" 

"You haven't time." 

"No, not by hand. But if we 
could photograph it." 

"No one would do it for you." 

He stopped. She was right. There 
was no one to trust, except, perhaps, Professor Faber. Montag 
started for the door. 

"You'll be here for the t-v party, ' 
won't you?" Mildred called after 
him. "It wouldn't be fun without 
you." 

"You'd never miss me." But she 
was looking at the late afternoon 
t-v show and didn't hear. He went 
out and slammed the door, the book 
in his hand. 

ONCE, as a child, he had sat 
upon the yellow dunes by the 
sea in the middle of the blue and 



hot summer day, trying to fill a 
sieve with sand. The faster he 
poured, the faster it sifted through 
with a hot whispering. He tried all 
day because some cruel cousin had 
said, "Fill this sieve and you'll get 
a dime!" 

Seated there in the midst of 
July, he had cried. His hands were 
tired, the sand was boiling, the 
sieve was empty. 

And now, as the jet-underground 
car roared him through the lower 
cellars of town, rocking him, jolting him, he remembered that frustrating sieve and he held this 
precious copy of the old and new 
testaments fiercely in his hands, 
trying to pour the words into his 
mind. But the words fell through, 
and he thought, in a few hours I 
must hand this book to Leahy, but 
I must remember each word, no 
phrase must escape me, each line 
can be memorized. I must remember, I must. 

"But I do not remember." He 
shut the book and pressed it with 
his fists and tried to force his mind. 

"Try Denham's Dentifrice tonight!" screamed the radio in the 
bright, shuddering wall of the jettrain. Trumpets blared. 

"Shut up," thought Mr. Montag 
in panic. "Behold, the lilies of the 
field—" 

"Denham's Dentifrice!" 

"They toil not — " 

"Denham's Dentifrice!" 

"Behold, the lilies of the field, 
shut up, let me remember!" 



THE FIREMAN 



27 



"Denham's Dentifrice!" 

He tore the book open furiously 
and flicked the pages about as if 
blind, tearing at the lines with raw 
eyes, staring until his eyelashes 
were wet and quivering. 

"Denham's, Denham's, Denham's! D-E-N— " 

"They toil not, neither do 
they . . ." 

A whisper, a faint sly whisper of 
yellow sand through empty, empty 
sieve. 

"Denham's does it!" 

"Behold, the lilies — " 

"No dandier dental detergent!" 

"Shut up!" It was a shriek so 
loud, so vicious that the loudspeaker seemed stunned. Mr. Montag found himself on his feet, the 
shocked inhabitants of the loud car 
looking at him, recoiling from a 
man with an insane, gorged face, a 
gibbering wet mouth, a flapping 
book in his fist. These rabbit people who hadn't asked for music 
and commercials on their public 
trains but who had got it by the 
sewerful, the air drenched and 
sprayed and pummeled and kicked 
by voices and music every instant. 
And here was an idiot man, himself, suddenly scrabbling at the 
wall, beating at the loudspeaker, at 
the enemy of peace, at the killer of 
philosophy and privacy! 

"Madman !" 

"Call the conductor!" 

"Denham's, Denham's Double 
Dentifrice!" 

"Fourteenth Street!" 



Only that saved him. The car 
stopped. Montag, thrown into the 
aisle by the grinding halt, rolled 
over, book in hand, leaped up past 
the pale, frightened faces, screamed 
in his mind soundlessly, and was 
out the opening door of the train 
and running on the white tiles up 
and up through tunnels, alone, that 
voice still crying like a seagull on 
a lonely shore after him, "Denham's, Denham's . . ." 

PROFESSOR FABER opened 
the door, saw the book, seized 
it. "My God, I haven't held a copy 
in years!" 

"We burned a house last night. 
I stole it." 

"What a chance to take!" 
Montag stood catching his 
breath. "I was curious." 

"Of course. It's beautiful. Here, 
come in, shut the door, sit down." 
Faber walked with the book in his 
finger-s, feeling it, flipping the 
pages slowly, hungrily, a thin man, 
bald, with slender hands, as light 
as chaff. "There were a lot of lovely books once. Before we let them 
go." He sat down and put his hand 
over his eyes. "You are looking at 
a coward, Mr. Montag. When they 
burned the last of the evil books, 
as they called them, forty years 
back, I made only a few feeble 
protestations and subsided. I've 
damned myself ever since." 

"It's not too late. There are still 
books." 

"And there is still life in me, and 



28 




 



I'm afraid of dying. Civilizations 
fall because men like myself fear 
death." 

"I've a plan," said Montag. "I'm 
in a position to do things. I'm a 
fireman; I can find and hide books. 
Last night I lay awake, thinking. 
We might publish many books privately when we have copies to print 
from." 

"How many have been killed for 
that?" 

"We'll get a press." 

"We? Not we. You, Mr. Montag." 

"You must help me. You're the 
only one I know. You must." 
"Must? What do you mean, 

must?" 

"We could find someone to 
build a press for us." 

"Impossible. The books are 
dead." 

"We can bring them back. I 
have a little money." 

"No, no." Faber waved his 
hands, his old hands, blotched with 
liver freckles. 

"But let me tell you my plan." 

"I don't want to hear. If you 
insist on telling me, I must ask you 
to leave." 

"We'll have extra copies of each 
book printed and hide them in firemen's houses !" 

"What?" The professor raised 
his brows and gazed at Montag as 
if a bright light had been switched 
on. 

"Yes, and put in an alarm." 
"Call the fire engines?" 



"Yes, and see the engines roar 
up. See the doors battered down 
on firemen's houses for a change. 
And see the planted books found 
and each fireman, at last, accused 
and thrown in jail!" 

The professor put his hand to 
his face. "Why, that's absolutely 
sinister." 

"Do you like it?" 

"The dragon eats his tail." 

"You'll join me?" 

"I didn't say that. No, no." 

"TOUT you see the confusion and 

-L» suspicion we could spread?" 

"Yes, plenty of trouble there." 

"I've a list of firemen's homes 
all across the states. With an underground, we could reap fire and 
chaos for every blind bastard in the 
industry." 

"You can't trust anyone, though." 

"What about professors like 
yourself, former actors, directors, 
writers, historians, linguists?" 

"Dead, or ancient, all of them." 

"Good. They'll have fallen from 
public notice. You know hundreds 
of them. I know you must." 

"Nevertheless, I can't help you, 
Montag. I'll admit your idea appeals to my sense of humor, to my 
delight in striking back. A temporary delight, however. I'm a 
frightened man; I frighten easily." 

"Think of the actors alone, then, 
who haven't acted Shakespeare or 
Pirandello. We could use their 
anger, and the rage of historians 
who haven't written for forty years. 



THE FIREMAN

We could start small classes in 
reading . . ." 

"Impractical." 

"We could try." 

"The whole civilization must 
fall. We can't change just the 
front. The framework needs melting and remolding. Don't you realize, young man, that the Great 
Burning forty years back was almost 
unnecessary? By that time the public had stopped reading. Libraries 
were Saharas of emptiness. Except 
the Science Department." 

"But—" 

"Can you shout louder than 
radio, dance faster than t-v? People don't want to think. They're 
having fun." 

"Committing suicide." 

"Let them commit it." 

"Murdering." 

"Let them murder. The fewer 
fools there will be." 

"A war is starting, perhaps tonight, and no one will even talk 
about it." 

The house shook. A bomber 
flight was moving south. It had 
slowed to five hundred miles an 
hour and was trembling the two 
men standing there across from each 
other. 

"Let the war turn off the t-vs 
and radio, and bomb the true confessions." 

"I can't wait," said Montag. 

"Patience. The civilization is 
flinging itself to pieces. Stand back 
from the centrifuge." 

"There has to be another struc


ture ready when this one falls," insisted Montag. "That's us." 

"A bunch of men quoting Shakespeare and saying I remember 
Sophocles ? It would be funny if it 
were not tragic." 

"We've got to be there. We've 
got to remind those who are left 
that there are things more urgent 
than machines. We must remember 
that the right kind of work is 
happiness, instead of the wrong 
kind of leisure. We must give people things to do. We must make 
them feel wanted again." 

"They will only war again. No, 
Montag, go on home and go to 
bed. It was nice seeing you. But 
it's a lost cause." 

MONTAG paced about the 
room for a few moments, 
chafing his hands, then he returned 
and picked up the book and held 
it toward the other man. 

"Do you see this book? Would 
you like to own it?" 

"My God, yes! I'd give my right 
arm for it." 

"Watch." Montag began ripping 
the pages out, one by one, dropping them to the floor, tearing 
them in half, spitting on them and 
rolling them into wads. 

"Stop it!" cried Faber. "You 
idiot, stop it!" He sprang forward. 
Montag warded him off and went 
on tearing at the pages. 

"Do you see?" he said, a fistful 
of pages in his tightening fist, flourishing them under the chin of the 



30 




 



old man. "Do you see what it 
means to have your heart torn out? 
Do you see what they do?" 

"Don't tear any more, please," 
said the old man. 

"Who can stop me? You? I'm a 
fireman. I can do anything I want 
to do. Why, I could burn your 
house now, do you know that? I 
could burn everything. I have the 
power." 

"You wouldn't!" 

"No. I wouldn't." 

"Please. The book; don't rip it 
any more. I can't stand that." Faber 
sank into a chair, his face white, 
his mouth trembling. "I see; I understand. My God, I'm old enough 
so it shouldn't matter what happens 
to me. I'll help you. I can't take 
any more of this. If I'm killed, it 
won't make any difference. I'm a 
terrible fool of an old man and 
it's too late, but I'll help you." 

"To print the books?" 

"Yes." 

"To start classes?" 

"Yes, yes, anything, but don't 
ruin that book, don't. I never 
thought a book could mean so much 
to me." Faber sighed. "Let us say 
that you have -my limited cooperation. Let us say that part of your 
plan, at least, intrigues me, the idea 
of striking back with books planted 
in firemen's homes. I'll help. How 
much money could you get me today?" 

"Five thousand dollars." 
"Bring it here when you can. I 
know a man who once printed our 



college paper. That was the year I 
came to class one morning and 
found only two students' to sign up 
for Ancient Greek Drama. You see, 
that's how it went. Like an iceblock 
melting in the sun. And when the 
people had censored themselves into 
a living idiocy with their purchasing power, the Government, which 
of course represents the people's 
will, being composed of representative people, froze the situation. 
Newspapers died. No one cared if 
the Government said they couldn't 
come back. No one wanted them 
back. Do they now? I doubt it, 
but I'll contact a printer, Montag. 
We'll get the books started, and 
wait for the war. That's one fine 
thing; war destroys machines so 
beautifully." 

MONTAG went to the door. 
"I'm afraid I'll have to take 
the Bible along." 
"No!" 

"Leahy guessed I have a book in 
the house. He didn't come right 
out and accuse me, or name the 
book . . ." 

"Can't you substitute another 
book for this?" 

"I can't chance it. It might be 
a trap. If he expects me to bring a 
Bible and I brought something else, 
I'd be in jail very quickly. No, I'm 
afraid this Bible will be burned tonight." 

"That's hard to accept." Faber 
took it for a moment and turned 
the pages, slowly, reading. 



THE FIREMAN

"I've tried to memorize it," said 
Montag. "But I forget. It's driven 
me crazy, trying to remember." 

"Oh, God, if we only had a little 
time." 

"I keep thinking that. Sorry." 
He took the book. "Good night." 

The door shut. Montag was in 
the darkening street again, looking 
at the real world. 

YOU could feel the war getting 
ready in the sky that night. 
The way the clouds moved aside 
and came back, and the way the 
stars looked, a million of them hovering between the clouds, like the 
enemy discs, and the feeling that 
the sky might fall upon the city 
and turn the homes to chalk dust, 
and the moon turn to red fire; that 
was how the night felt. 

Montag walked from the subway stop with his money in Kis 
pocket — he had been to the bank 
which stayed open until all hours 
with mechanical tellers doling out 
the money — and as he walked he 
was listening abstractedly to the 
Seashell radio which you could cup 
to your ear (Buy a Seashell and 
hear the Ocean of Time!) and a 
voice was talking to him and only 
him as he turned his feet toward 
home. "Things took another turn 
for the worse today. War threatens 
at any hour." 

Always the same monologue.Nothing about causes or effects, no 
facts, no figures, nothing but sudden turns for the worse. 



Seven nights of jet-rockets went 
over the sky in a breath. Montag 
felt the money in his pocket, the 
Bible in his hand. He had given up 
trying to memorize it now; he was 
simply reading "it for the enjoyment 
it gave, the simple pleasure of good 
words on the tongue and in the 
mind. He uncupped the Seashell 
radio from his ear and read another 
page of the Book of Job by moonlight. 

AT EIGHT o'clock, the front 
door scanner recognized three 
women and opened, letting them in 
with laughter and loud, empty talk. 
Mrs. Masterson, Mrs. Phelps, and 
Mrs. Bowles drank the martinis 
Mildred handed them, rioting like 
a crystal chandelier that someone 
has pushed, tinkling upon themselves in a million crystal chimes, 
flashing the same white smiles, their 
echoes repeated in empty corridors. 
Mr. Montag found himself in the 
middle of a conversation, the main 
topic of which was how nice everyone looked. 

"Doesn't everyone look nice?" 
"Real nice." 
"You look fine, Alma." 
"You look fine, too, Mildred." 
"Everybody looks nice and fine," 
said Montag. 

He had put the book aside. None 
of it would stay in his mind. The s 
harder he tried to remember Job, 
for instance, the quicker it vanished. He wanted to be out paying 
this money to Professor Faber, get


32 




 



ting things going, and yet he 
delayed himself. It would be dangerous to be seen at Faber's twice 
within a few hours, just in case 
Leahy was taking the precaution of 
having Montag watched. 

Like it or not, he must spend the 
rest of the evening at home, and 
be ready to report to work at eleven 
so that Leahy wouldn't be suspicious. Most of all, Montag wanted 
to walk, but he rarely did this any 
more. Somehow he was always 
afraid that he might meet Clafisse, 
or not meet her again, on his strolls, 
so that kept him here standing ' 
among these blonde) tenpins, bowling back at them with socially required leers and wisecracks. 

Somehow the television set was 
turned on before they had even finished saying how nice everyone 
looked, and there on the screen was 
a man selling orange soda pop and 
a woman drinking it with a smile; 
how could she drink and smile 
simultaneously? A real stunt! Following this, a demonstration of how 
to bake a certain new cake, followed by a rather dreary domestic 
comedy, a news analysis that did 
not analyze anything and did not 
mention the war, even though the 
house was shaking constantly with 
the flight of new jets from four 
directions, and an intolerable quiz 
show naming the state capitals. 

Montag sat tapping his fingers 
on his knee and exhaling. 

Abruptly, he walked to the televisor and snapped it off. 



"I thought we might enjoy a 
little silence." 

Everyone blinked. 

"Perhaps we might try a little 
conversation . . ." 

"Conversation ?" 

THE house shook with successive 
waves of jet bombers which 
splashed the drinks in the ladies' 
hands. 

"There they go," said Montag, 
watching the ceiling. "When do 
you suppose the war will start?" 

"What war? There won't be a 
war." 

"I notice your husbands aren't 
here tonight." 

Mrs. Masterson glanced nervously at the empty t-v screen. "Oh, 
Dick'll be back in a week or so. 
The Army called him. But they 
have these things every month or 
so." She beamed. 

"Don't you worry about the 
war?" 

"Well, heavens, if there is one, 
it's got to be over with. We can't 
just sit and worry, can we?" 

"No, but we can think about it'" 

"I'll let Dick think of it." A 
nervous giggle. 

"And die maybe." 

"It's always someone else's husband dies, isn't that the joke?" The 
women all tittered. 

Yes, thought Montag, and even 
if Dick does die, what does it matter? We've learned the magic of 
the replaceable part from machines. 
You can't tell one man from an

other these days. And women, like 
so many plastic dolls — • 

Everyone was silent, like children 
with a schoolmaster. 

"Did you see the Clarence Dove 
film last night?" said Mildred, 
suddenly. 

"He's hilarious." 

"But what if Dick should die, or 
yor/r husband, Mrs. Phelps?" Montag insisted. 

"He's dead. He died a week ago. 
Didn't you know? He jumped from 
the tenth floor of the State Hotel." 

"I didn't know." Montag fell 
silent, embarrassed. 

"But to get back to Clarence 
Dove . . ." said Mildred. 



"Wait a minute," said Montag, 
angrily. "Mrs. Phelps, why did you 
marry your husband ? What did you 
have in common?" 

The woman waved her hands 
helplessly. "Why, he had such a 
nice sense of humor, and we liked 
the same t-v shows and — " 

"Did you have any children?" 

"Don't be ridiculous." 

"Come to think of it, no one 
here has children," said Montag. 
"Except Mrs. Bowles." 

"Four, by Caesarian section. It's 
easy that way." 

"The Caesarians weren't necessary?" 

"I always said I'd be damned if 
I'd go through all that agony just 
for a baby. Four Caesarians. Nothing to it, really." 

Yes, everything easy. Montag 
clenched his teeth. To mistake the 
easy way for the right way, how 
delicious a temptation. But it wasn't 
living. A woman who wouldn't 
bear, or a shiftless man didn't belong; they were passing through. 
They belonged to nothing and did 
nothing. 

"Have you ever thought, ladies," 
he said, growing more contemptuous of them by the moment, "that 
perhaps this isn't the best of all 
possible worlds? That perhaps our 
civil rights and other precious possessions haven't been taken away in 
the past century, but have, if anything, been given away by us?" 

"Why, that can't be true! We'd 
have heard about it."

«/~\N THAT pap-dispenser?" 

V/ cried Montag, jerking his 
hand at the t-v. Suddenly he shoved 
his hand in his pocket and drew 
forth a piece of printed paper. He 
was shaking with rage and irritation and he was half blind, staring 
down at the twitching sheet before 
his eyes. 

"What's that?" Mrs. Masterson 
squinted. 

"A poem I tore from a book." 

"I don't like poetry." 

"Have you ever heard any?" 

Mildred jumped up, but Montag 
said, coldly, "Sit down." The women all lit cigarets nervously, 
twisting their red mouths. 

"This is illegal, isn't it?" 
squealed Mrs. Phelps. "I'm afraid. 
I'm going home." 

"Sit down and shut up," said 
Montag. 

The room was quiet. 

"This is a poem by a man named 
Matthew Arnold," said Montag. 
"Its title is Dover Beach." 

The women were all glancing 
with expectation at the television 
set, as if it might save them from 
this moment. 

Montag cleared his throat. He 
waited. He wanted very much to 



speak the poem right, and he was 
afraid that he might stumble. He 
read. 

His voice rose and fell in the 
silent room and he found his way 
through to the final verses of the 
poem : 

"The Sea of Faith 

Was once, too, at the full, and 

round earth's shore 
Lay like the folds of a bright 

girdle furled. 
But now I only hear 
Its melancholy, long, withdrawing 

roar, 

Retreating, to the breath 

Of the night-wind, down the vast 

edges drear 
And naked shingles of the world." 

The four women twisted in their 
chairs. 

Montag finished it out: 

"Ah, love, let us be true 

To one another! for' the world, 

which seems 
To lie before us like a land of 

dreams, 

So various, so beautiful, so new, 
Hath really neither" joy, nor love, 
nor light, 



THE FIREMAN 



35 



Nor certitude, nor peace, nor help 
for pain; 

And we are here as on a darkling 
plain 

Swept with confused alarms of 

struggle and flight, 
Where ignorant armies clash by 

night." " 

Montag let the white piece of 
paper fall slowly to the floor. The 
women watched it flutter and settle. 

Mildred said, "Can I turn the 
t-v on now?" 

"No, God damn it, no!" 

Mildred sat down. 

Mrs. Masterson said, "I don't 
get it. The poem, I mean." 

"What was it about?" asked 
Mrs. Phelps, her eyes darting fearfully in flashes of white and dark. 

"Don't you see?" shouted Montag. 

"Nothing to get upset about," 
said Mrs. Masterson, casually. 
"But it is, it is." 

"Just silly words," said Mrs. 
Masterson. "But, Mr. Montag, I 
don't mind telling you — it is only 
because you're a fireman that we 
haven't called in an alarm on you 
for reading this to us. It's illegal. 
But it's also very silly. It was nonsense." She got to her feet and 
mashed out her cigaret. "Ladies, 
don't you think it's time for us to 
leave?" 

"I don't want to come back 
here, ever," said Mrs. Phelps, hurrying for the dsor. 

"Please stay!" cried Mildred. 



The door slammed. 

"Go home and think of your 
first husband, Mrs. Masterson, in 
the insane asylum, and of Mr. 
Phelps jumping off a building!" 
yelled Montag through the shut 
door. 

The house was completely abandoned. He stood alone. 

In the bathroom, water was running. He heard Mildred shaking 
the sleeping tablets out into her 
palm. 

"You fool," he said to himself. 
"You idiot. Now you've done it. 
Now you've ruined it all, you and 
your poem, you and your righteous 
indignation." 

He went into the kitchen and 
found the books where Mildred had 
stacked them behind the refrigerator. He carried a selection of them 
into the back yard, hid them in the 
weeds near the fence. "Just in 
case," he thought, "Mildred gets a 
passion for burning things during 
the night. The best books out here; 
the others in the house don't matter." 

He went back through the house. 
"Mildred?" he called at the bedroom door but there was no sound. 

He shut the front door quietly 
and left for work. 

"rnHANK you, Montag." Mr. 

JL Leahy accepted the copy of 
the Bible and, without even looking 
at it, dropped it into the wall incinerator. "Let's forget all about it. 
Glad to see you back, Montag." 




 



They walked upstairs. 

They sat and played cards at one 
minute after midnight. 

In Leahy's sight, Montag felt the 
guilt of his hands. His fingers were 
like ferrets that had done some evil 
deed, and now were never at rest, 
always stirring and picking and 
hiding in pockets, or moving out 
from under Leahy's alcohol-flame 
gaze. If Leahy so much as breathed 
on them, Montag felt that they 
might wither upon his wrists and 
die and he might never shake them 
to life again; they would be buried 
forever in his coat sleeves, forgotten. 
For these were the hands that 
had acted on their own, that were 
no part of him, that were his swift 
and clever conscience, that snatched 
books, tore pages, hid paragraphs 
and sentences in little wads to be 
opened later, at home, by matchlight, read and burned. They were 
the hands that in the last year had 
darted off with Shakespeare and 
Job and Ruth and shelved them 
away next his crashing heart, over 
the throbbing ribs and the hot, 
roaring blood of a man excited by 
his theft, appalled by his temerity, 
betrayed by ten fingers which at 
times he held up to watch as if 
they were gloved with blood. 

The game proceeded. Twice in 
half an hour, Montag got up and 
went to the latrine to wash his 
hands. He came back. He sat down. 
He held his cards. Leahy watched 
his fingers fumble the cards. 



"Not smoking, Montag?" 

"I've a cigaret cough." 

And then, of course, the smoke 
reminded him of old men and old 
women screaming and falling into 
wild cinders, and it was not good 
any more to hold fire in your hand. 

He put his hands under the 
table. "Let's have your hands in 
sight," said Leahy, casually. "Not 
that we don't trust you." 

They all laughed. 

The phone rang. 

MR. LEAHY, carrying his cards 
in one pink hand, walked 
slowly over and stood by the 
phone, let it ring twice more, and 
then picked it up. 
"Yes?" 

Mr. Montag listened, eyes shut. 

The clock ticked in the room. 

"I see," said Leahy. He looked 
at Montag. He smiled. He winked. 
Montag glanced away. "Better give 
me that address again." 

Mr. Montag got up. He walked 
around the room, hands in pockets. 
The other two men were standing 
ready. Leahy jerked his head toward their coats, as if to say, "On 
the double!" They shoved their 
arms in their coats and pushed on 
their helmets, joking in whispers. 

Mr.- Montag waited. 

"I understand perfectly," said 
Leahy into the phone. "Yes. Yes. 
Perfectly. No, that's all right. Don't 
you worry. We'll be right out." 

Leahy deposited the receiver. 
"Well, well." 



THE FIREMAN 



37 



"A call? Books to be burned?" 
"So it seems." 

Mr. Montag sat down heavily. 
"I don't feel well." 

"What a shame; this is a special 
case," said Leahy, coming forward 
slowly, putting on his slicker. 

"I think I'm handing in my resignation." 

"Not yet, Montag. One more 
fire, eh? Then I'll be agreeable; 
you can hand in your papers. We'll 
all be happy." 

"Do you mean that?" 

"Have I ever lied to you?" 

Leahy fetched a helmet. "Put this 
on. The job'll be over in an hour. 
I understand you, Montag, really I 
do. Everything will be just as you 
want it." 

"All right." 

They slid down the brass pole. 

"Where's the fire?" 

"Til drive!" shouted Leahy. 
"I've got the address." 

The engine blasted to life and 
in the gaseous tornado they all 
leaped aboard. 

THEY rounded a corner in thunder and siren, with concussion 
of tires, with scream of rubber, with 
a shift of kerosene bulk in the glittery brass tank, like the food in the 
stomach of a giant, with Mr. Montag's fingers jolting off the silver 
rail, swinging into cold space, with 
the wind tearing his hair back from 
his bleak face, with the wind whistling in his teeth, and he all the 
while thinking of the women, the 



chaff women, with the kernels 
blown out from under them by a 
neon wind, and his reading a book 
to them. 

What. a silly thing it was now! 
For what was a book? Sheets of 
paper, lines of type. Why should he 
fret for books — one, two, or ten 
thousand of them, really? He was 
the only inhabitant of a burning 
world that cared, so why not drop 
it all, forget it, let the now-meaningless books lie? 

"Here we go!" shouted Leahy. 

"Elm Street?" 

"Right!" 

He saw Leahy up on his driver's 
throne, with his massive black 
slicker flapping out behind. He 
seemed to be an immense black bat 
flying above the engine, over the 
brass numbers, taking the wind. 
His pink, phosphorescent face glimmered in the high darkness, pressing forward, and he was smiling 
furiously. 

"Here we go to keep the world 
happy!" 

And Mr. Montag thought, "No, 
I can't let the books rot; I can't let 
them burn. As long as there are 
souls like Leahy, I can't hold my 
breath. But what can I do? I can't 
kill everyone. It's me against the 
world, and the odds too big for 
any man. What can I do? Against 
fire, what water is best?" 

"Now over on Park Terrace!" 

The fire engine boomed to a halt, 
throwing the men off in skips and 
clumsy hops. Mr. Montag stood fix


38 




 



ing his raw eyes to the cold bright 
rail under his gripped fingers. 

"I can't do it," he murmured. "I 
can't go in there. I can't rip another 
book." 

Leahy jumped from his throne, 
smelling of the wind that had 
hammered him about. "Okay, Montag, fetch the kerosene!" 

The hoses were snaked out. The 
men ran on soft boots, as clumsy 
as cripples, as quiet as deadly black 
spiders. 

Mr. Montag turned his head. 

"What's wrong, Montag?" Leahy 
asked, solicitously. 

"Why," protested Montag, "that 
is my house." 

"So it is," agreed Leahy, heartily. 

All the lights were lit. Down the 
street, more lights were flicking on, 
people were standing on porches, 
as the door of Montag's house 
opened. In it, with two suitcases in 
her hands, stood Mildred. When 
she saw her husband, she came 
down the steps quickly, with a 
dreamlike rigidity, looking at the 
third button on his coat. 

"Mildred!" 

She said nothing. 

"Okay, Montag, up with the hose 
and ax." 

"Just a moment, Mr. Leahy. Mildred, you didn't telephone this call 
in, did you?" 

SHE walked past him with her 
arms stiff and at the ends of 
them, in the sharp, red-nailed fin


gers, the valise handles. Her mouth 
was bloodless. 

"You didn't!" he said. 

She shoved the valises into a 
waiting taxi-beetle and climbed in 
and sat there, staring straight 
ahead. 

Montag started toward her. 
Leahy caught his arm. 

"Come on, Montag." 

The cab drove away slowly down 
the lighted street. 

There was a crystal tinkling as 
Stoneman and Black chopped the 
windows to provide fine drafts for 
the fire. 

Mr. Montag walked but did not 
feel his feet touch the walk, nor the 
hose in his icy hands, nor did he 
hear. Leahy talking continually as 
they reached the door. 

"Pour the kerosene in, Montag." 

Montag stood gazing in at the 
queer house, made strange by the 
hour of the night, by the murmur 
of neighbor voices, by the littered 
glass, the lights blazing, and there 
on the floor, their covers plucked 
off, the pages spilled about like 
pigeon feathers, were his incredible 
books, and they looked so pitiful 
and silly and not worth bothering 
with, for they were nothing but type 
and paper and raveled binding. 

Montag stepped forward in a 
huge silence and picked up one of 
the pages of the books and read 
what it had to say. 

He had read only three lines 
when Leahy snatched the paper 
from him. 



THE FIREMAN 



39 



"Oh, no," he said, smiling. "Because then we'd have to burn your 
mind, too. Mustn't have that." He 
stepped back. "Ready?" 

"Ready." Montag snapped the 
valve lock on the fire-thrower. 

"Aim," said Leahy. 

"Aim." 

"Fire!" 

He burned the television set first 
and then the radio and he burned 
the motion picture projector and 
he burned the films and the gossip 
magazines and the litter of cosmetics on a table, and he took 
pleasure in it all, and he burned the 
walls because he wanted to change 
everything, the chairs, the tables, 
the paintings. He didn't want to 
remember that he had lived here 
with some strange woman who 
would forget him tomorrow, who 
had gone and forgotten him already 
and was listening to a radio as she 
rode across town. So he burned the 
room with a precise fury. 

"The books, Montag, the 
books !" 

He directed the fire at the books. 
They leaped and danced, like roasted birds, their wings frantically 
ablaze in red and yellow feathers. 
They fell in charred lumps. 

"Get that one there, get it!" directed Leahy, pointing. 

Montag burned the indicated 
book. 

He burned books, he burned 
them by the dozen, he burned 
books with sweat pouring down 
his cheeks. 



"When you're all done, Montag," said Leahy behind him, 
"you're under arrest." 

Ill 

Water, Water, Quench fire 

THE house fell into red ruin. 
It bedded itself down to 
sleepy pink ashes and a 
smoke pall hung over it, rising 
straight to the sky. It was ten minutes after one in the morning. The 
crowd drew back into their houses; 
the fun was over. 

Mr. Montag stood with the firethrower in his stiff hands, great 
islands of perspiration standing out 
under his arms, his face smeared 
with soot. The three other firemen 
waited behind him in the darkness, 
their faces illumined faintly by the 
burned house, by the house which 
Mr. Montag had just charred and 
crumpled so efficiently with kerosene, flame-gun, and deliberate aim. 

"All right, Montag," said Leahy. 
"Come along. You've done your 
duty. Now, you're in custody." 
"What've I done?" 
'•'You know what you did. Don't 
ask." 

"Why so much fuss over a few I 
bits of paper?" 

"We won't stand here arguing; 
it's cold." 

"Was it my wife called you, or 
one of her friends?" 

"It doesn't matter." 

"Was it my wife?" 



40 




 



Leahy nodded. "But her friends 
turned in an alarm earlier. I let it 
ride. One way or the other, you'd 
have got it. That was pretty silly, 
quoting poetry around free and 
easy, Montag. Very silly. Come on, 
now." 

"I think not," said Montag. 

He twitched the fire-trigger in 
his hand. Leahy glanced at Montag's fingers and saw what he intended before Montag himself had 
even considered it. In that instant, 
Montag was stunned by the thought 
of murder, for murder is always a 
new thing, and Montag knew 
nothing of murder; he knew only 
burning and burning things that 
people said were evil. 

"I know what's really wrong 
with the world," said Montag. 

"Look here, Montag — " cried 
Leahy. 

And then he was a shrieking 
blaze, a jumping, sprawling, gibbering thing, all aflame, writhing 
on the grass as Montag shot three 
more blazing pulses of liquid fire 
over him. There was a hissing and 
bubbling like a snail upon which 
salt has been poured. There was a 
sound like spittle on a red-hot 
stove. Montag shut his eyes and 
yelled and tried to get his hands 
to his ears to cut away the sounds. 
Leahy twisted in upon himself like 
a ridiculous black wax doll and lay 
silent. 

The other two firemen stood appalled. 
"Montag!" 



Montag jerked the weapon at 
them. "Turn around!" 

They turned stiffly. He beat them 
over the heads with the gun shaft; 
he didn't want to burn any other 
thing ever again. They fell. Then 
Montag turned the fire-thrower on 
the fire engine itself, set the trigger, 
and ran. Voices screamed in several houses. The engine blew up, 
hundreds of gallons of kerosene in 
one great flower of heat. 

Montag ran away down the 
street and into an alley, thinking, 
"That's the end of you, Leahy! 
That's the end of you and what 
you were!" 

He kept running. 

HE REMEMBERED the books 
and turned back. 
"You're a fool, a damned fool, 
an awful fool, an idiot, but most of 
all a fool." He stumbled and fell. 
He got up. "You blind idiot, you 
and your pride and your stinking 
temper and your righteousness, 
you've ruined it all, at the very 
start, you fumbler. But those 
women, those stupid women, they 
drove me to it with their nonsense!" he protested to himself. 

"A fool, nevertheless, no better 
than they! 

"We'll save what we can. We'll 
do what has to be done. We'll take 
a few more firemen with us if we 
burn !" 

He found the books where he 
had left them, beyond the garden 
fence. He heard voices yelling in 



THE FIREMAN 



41 



the night and flashbeams were 
swirling about. Other fire engines 
wailed from far off and police cars 
were arriving. 

Mr Montag took as many books 
as he could carry under one arm 
and staggered down the alley. He 
hadn't realized what a shock the 
evening had been to him, but suddenly he fell and lay sobbing, 
weak, his legs folded, his face in 
the gravel. At a distance he heard 
running feet. Get up, he told himself. But he lay there. Get up, get 
up! But he cried like a child. He 
hadn't wanted to kill anyone, not 
even Leahy. Killing did nothing 
but kill something of yourself 
when you did it, and suddenly he 
saw Leahy again, a torch, screaming, and he shut his hand over his 
wet face, gagging. "I'm sorry, I'm 
sorry." 

Everything at once. In twentyfour hours the burning of a woman, the burning of books, the trip 



to the professor's, Leahy, the Bible, 
memorizing, the sieve and the sand, 
the bank money, the printing press, 
the plan, the rage, the alarm, Mildred's departure, the fire, Leahy 
into a torch — too much for any 
one day in any one life. 

At last he was able to get to his 
feet, but the books seemed impossibly heavy. He fumbled along the 
alley and the voices and sirens 
faded behind him. He moved in 
darkness, panting. 

"You must remember," he said, 
"that you've got to burn them or 
they'll burn you. Burn them or 
they'll burn you." 

He searched his pockets. The 
money was there. In his shirt pocket 
he found the Seashell radio and 
slapped it to his ear. 

"Attention! Attention, all police 
alert. Special alarm. Wanted: Leonard Montag, fugitive, for murder 
and crimes against the State. Description . . ." 




42 




 



Six blocks away the alley opened 
out onto a wide empty thoroughfare. It looked like a clean stage, 
so bored, so quiet, so well lit, and 
him alone, running across it, easily 
seen, easily shot down. 

"Beware of the pedestrian, watch 
for the pedestrian!" The Seashell 
stung his ear. 

Montag hid back in the shadows. 
He must use only the alleys. There 
was a gas station nearby. It might 
give him the slightest extra margin 
of safety if he were clean and presentable. He must get to the station 
rest room and wash up, comb his 
hair, then, with books under arm, 
stroll calmly across that wide boulevard to get where he was going. 

"Where am I going?" 

NOWHERE. There was nowhere 
to go, no friend to turn to. 
Faber couldn't take him in; it would 
be murder to even try; but he had 
to see Faber for a minute or two, 



to give him this money. Whatever 
happened, he wanted the money to 
go on after him. Perhaps he could 
make it to open country, Jive on 
the rivers and near highways, in 
the meadows and hills, the sort of 
life he had often thought about but 
never tried. 

Something caught at one corner 
of his vision and he turned to look 
at the sky. 

The police helicopters were rising, far away, like a flight of gray 
moths, spreading out, six of them. 
He saw them wavering, indecisive, 
a half mile off, like butterflies 
puzzled by autumn, dying with win. ter, and then they were landing, 
one by one, dropping softly to the 
streets where, turned into cars, they 
would shriek along the boulevards 
or, just as suddenly, hop back into 
the air, continuing their search. 

And here was the gas station. Approaching from the rear, Mr. Montag entered the men's wash room. 





Through the tin wall he heard a 
radio voice crying, "War has been 
declared ! Repeat — war has been declared ! Ten minutes ago — " But 
the sound of washing his hands and 
rinsing his face and toweling himself dry cut the announcer's voice 
away. Emerging from the washroom a cleaner, newer man, less 
suspect, Mr. Montag walked as 
casually as a man looking for a bus, 
to the edge of the empty boulevard. 

There it lay, a game for him to 
win, a vast bowling alley in the 
dark morning. The boulevard was 
as clean as a pinball machine, but 
underneath, somewhere, one could 
feel the electrical energy, the readiness to dart lights, flash red and 
blue, and out of nowhere, rolling 
like a silver ball, might thunder the 
searchers! Three blocks away, there 
were a few headlights. Montag 
drew a deep breath. His lungs were 
like burning brooms in his chest; 
his mouth was sucked dry from 
running. All of the iron in the 
world lay in \iis dragging feet. 

He began to walk across the 
empty avenue. 

A hundred yards across. He estimated. A hundred yards in the 
open, more than plenty of time for 
a police car to appear, see him, and 
run him down. 

He listened to his own loud footsteps. 

A car was coming. Its headlights 
leaped and caught Montag in full 
stride. 1 



"Keep going." 

Montag faltered, got a new hold 
on his books, and forced himself 
not to freeze. Nor should he draw 
suspicion to himself by running. 
He was now one-third of the way 
across. There was a growl from the 
car's motor as it put on speed. 

THE police, thought Montag. 
They see me, of course. But 
walk slowly, quietly, don't turn, 
don't look, don't seem concerned. 
Walk, that's it, walk, walk. 

The car was rushing at a terrific 
speed. A good one hundred miles 
an hour. Its horn blared. Its light 
flushed the concrete. The heat of 
the lights, it seemed, burned Montag's cheeks and eyelids and brought 
the sweat coursing from his body. 

He began to shuffle idiotically, 
then broke and ran. The horn hooted. The motor sound whined 
higher. Montag sprinted. He 
dropped a book, whirled, hesitated, 
left it there, plunged on, yelling to 
himself, in the middle of concrete 
emptiness, the car a hundred feet 
away, closer, closer, hooting, pushing, rolling, screeching, the horn 
hunting, himself running, his legs 
up, down, out, back, his eyes blind 
in the flashing glare, the horn 
nearer, now on top of .him ! 

They'll run me down, they know 
who I am, it's all over, thought 
Montag, it's done! 

He stumbled and fell. 
. An instant before reaching him, 
the wild car swerved around him 



44 




 



and was gone. Falling had saved 
him. 

Mr. Montag lay flat, his head 
down. Wisps of laughter trailed 
back with the blue car exhaust. 

That wasn't the police, thought 
Mr. Montag. 

It was 'a earful of high-school 
children, yelling, whistling, hurrahing. And they had seen a man, a 
pedestrian, a rarity, and they had 
yelled "Let's get him!" They didn't 
know he was the fugitive Mr. Montag; they were simply out for a 
night of roaring five hundred miles 
in a few moonlit hours, their faces 
icy with wind. 

"They would have killed me," 
whispered Montag to the shaking 
concrete under his bruised cheek. 
"For no reason at all in the world, 
they would have killed me." 

He got up and walked unsteadily to the far curb. Somehow, he 
had remembered to pick up the 
spilled books. He shuffled them, 
oddly, in his numb hands. 

"I wonder if they were the ones 
who killed Clarisse." 

His eyes watered. 

The thing that had saved him 
was falling flat. The driver of that 
car, seeing Montag prone, considered the possibility that running 
over a body at one hundred miles 
an hour might turn the car over 
and spill them all out. Now, if 
Montag had remained upright, 
things would have been far different . . . 

Montag gasped. Far down the 



empty avenue, four blocks away, the 
car of laughing children had 
turned. Now it was racing back, 
picking up speed. 

Montag dodged into an alley and 
was gone in the shadow long before the car returned. 

THE house was silent. 
Mr. Montag approached it 
from the back, creeping through the 
scent of daffodils and roses and 
wet grass. He touched the screen 
door, found it open, slipped in, tiptoed across the porch, and, behind 
the refrigerator in the kitchen, deposited three of the books. He 
waited, listening to the house. 

"Mrs. Black, are you asleep up 
there?" he asked of the second 
floor in a whisper. "I hate to do 
this to you, but your husband did 
just as bad to others, never asking, 
never wondering, never worrying. 
You're a fireman's wife, Mrs. Black, 
and now it's your house, and you 
will be in jail a while, for all the 
houses your husband has burned 
and people he's killed." 
The ceiling did not reply. 
Quietly, Montag slipped from the 
house and returned to the alley. The 
house was still dark; no one had 
heard him come or go. 

He walked casually down the 
alley, and came to an all-night, 
dimly lighted phone booth. He 
closed himself in the booth and 
dialed a number. 

"I want to report an illegal own. ership of books," he said. 



THE FIREMAN 



45 



The voice sharpened on the other 
end. "The address?" 

He gave it and added, "Better 
get there before they burn them. 
Check the kitchen." 

Montag stepped out and stood 
in the cold night air, waiting. At a 
great distance he heard the fire 
sirens coming, coming to burn Mr. 
Black's house while he was away 
at work, and make his wife stand 
shivering in the morning air while 
the .roof dropped down. But now 
she was upstairs, deep in sleep. 

"Good night, Mrs. Black," said 
Mr. Montag. "You'll excuse me — 
I have several other visits to make." 

A RAP at the door. 
"Professor Faber!" 
Another rap and a long waiting. 
Then, from within, lights flickered 
on about the small house. After 
another pause, the front door 
opened. 

"Who is it?" Faber cried, for 
the man who staggered in was in 
the dark for a moment and then 
rushing past. "Oh, Montag!" 

"I'm going away," said Montag, 
stumbling to a chair. "I've been a 
fool." 

Professor Faber stood at the door 
listening to the distant sirens wailing off like animals in the morning. "Someone's been busy." 

"It worked." 

"At least you were a fool about 
the right things." Faber shut the 
door, came back, and poured a 
drink for each of them. "I won


dered what had happened to you." 

"I was delayed." Montag patted 
his inside pocket. "The money's 
here." He took it out and laid it on 
the desk, then sat tiredly sipping 
his drink. "How do you feel?" 

"This is the first night in many 
years I've fallen right to sleep," 
said Faber. "That must mean I'm 
doing the right thing. I think we 
can trust me now. Once, I didn't 
think so." 

"People never trust themselves, 
but they never let others know. I 
suppose that's why we do rash 
things, expose ourselves in positions from which we don't dare 
retreat. Unconsciously, we fear we 
might give in, quit the fight, and 
so we do a foolish thing, like reading poetry to women." Montag 
laughed at himself. "So I guess I'm 
on the run. It'll be up to you to 
keep things moving." 

"I'll do my damnedest." Faber 
sat down. "Tell me about it. What 
you did just now, I mean." 

"I hid my remaining books in 
four firemen's homes. Then I telephoned an alarm. I figured I might 
be dead by morning, and I wanted 
to have done something before 
then." 

"God, I'd like to've been there." 
"Yes, the places burned very 
well." 

"Where are you going now?" 

"I don't know." 

"Try the factory section, follow 
the old rail lines, look up some of 
the hobo camps. I didn't tell you 



46 




 



this before — maybe I didn't quite 
trust you yet, I don't know — but 
they were in touch with' me last 
year, wanting me to go underground 
with them." 

"With tramps?" 

"There are a lot of Harvard degrees on the tracks between here 
and Los Angeles. What else can 
they do? Most of them are wanted 
and hunted in cities. They survive. 
I don't think they have a plan for 
a revolution, though; I never heard 
them speak of it. They simply sit by 
their fires. Not a very lively group. 
But they might hide you now." 

"I'll try. I'm heading for the 
river, I think, then the old factory 
district. I'll keep in touch with 
you.' 

"In Boston, then. I'm leaving on 
the three o'clock train tonight — or, 
rather, this morning. That's not 
long from now. There's a retired 
printer in Boston that I want to 
see with this money." 

"I'll contact you there," said 
Montag. "And get books from you 
when I need them, to plant in firemen's houses across the country." 

MONTAG drained his drink. 
"Do you want to sleep here 
a while?" Faber asked. 

"I'd better get going. I wouldn't 
want you held responsible." 

"Let's check." Faber switched on 
the televisor. A voice was talking 
swiftly: 

" — this evening. Montag has 
escaped, but we expect his arrest 



in 24 hours. Here's a bulletin. The 
Electric Dog is being transported 
here from Green Town — " 

Montag and Faber glanced at 
each other. 

"—You may recall the interviews 
recently on t-v concerning this incredible new invention, a machine 
so delicate in sense perception that 
it can follow trails much as bloodhounds did for centuries. But this 
machine, without fail, ahvays finds 
its quarry!" 

Montag put his empty glass 
down and he was cold. 

'■'The machine is self-operating, 
weighs only forty pounds, is propelled on seven rubber wheels. The 
front is a nose, which in reality is 
a thousand noses, so sensitive that 
they can distinguish 10,000 food 
combinations, 5,000 flower smells, 
and remember identity index odors 
of 15,000 men without the bother 
of resetting." 

Faber began to tremble. He 
looked at his house, at the door, 
the floor, the chair in which Montag sat. Montag interpreted this 
look. They both stared together at 
the invisible trail of his footprints 
leading to this house, the odor of 
his hand on the brass doorknobs, 
the smell of his body in the air and 
on this chair. 

"The Electric Hound is now 
landing, by helicopter, at the burned 
Montag home. We take you there 
by t-v control!" 

So they must have a game* 
thought Montag. In the midst of a 



THE FIREMAN 



47 



time of war, they must play the 
game out. 

There was the burned house, the 
crowd, and something with a sheet 
over it, Mr. Leahy — yes, Mr. 
Leahy — and out of the sky, fluttering, came the red helicopter, landing like a grotesque and menacing 
flower. 

Montag watched the scene with 
a solid fascination, not wanting to 
move, ever. If he wished, he could 
linger here, in comfort, and follow 
the entire hunt on through its quick 
phases, down alleys, up streets, 
across empty running avenues, with 
the sky finally lightening with 
dawn, up other alleys to burned 
houses, and so on to this place here, 
this house, with Faber and himself seated at their leisure, smoking 
idly, drinking good wine, while the 
Electric Hound sniffed down the 
fatal paths, whirring and pausing 
with finality right outside that door 
there. 

Then, if he wished, Montag 
could rise, walk to the door, keep 
one eye on the t-v screen, open the 
door, look out, look back, and see 
himself, dramatized, described, 
made over, standing there, limned 
in the bright television screen, from 
outside, a drama to be watched objectively, and he would catch himself, an instant before oblivion, 
being killed for the benefit of a 
million televiewers who had been 
wakened from their sleeps a few 
minutes ago by the frantic beepbeeping of their receivers to watch 



the big game, the big hunt, the 
Scoop ! 

"There it is," whispered Faber, 
hoarsely. 

OUT of the helicopter glided 
something that was not a machine, not an animal, not dead, not 
alive, just gliding. It glowed with 
a green phosphorescence, and it 
was on a long leash. Behind it came 
a man, dressed lightly, with earphones on his shaven head. 

"I can't stay here." Montag 
leaped up, his eyes still fixed to the 
scene. The Electric Hound shot forward to the smoking ruins, the man 
running after it. A coat was brought 
forward. Montag recognized it as 
his own, dropped in the yard during flight. The Electric Hound 
studied it for only a moment. There 
was a whirring and clicking of dials 
and meters. 

"You can't escape." Faber 
mourned over it, turning away. 
"I've heard about that damned 
monster. No one has ever escaped." 

"I'll try, anyway. I'm sorry about 
this, Professor." 

"About me? About my house? 
Don't be. I'm the one to be sorry 
I didn't act years ago. Whatever I 
get out of this, I deserve. You run, 
now; perhaps I can delay them here 
somehow — " 

"Wait a minute." Montag moved 
forward. "There's no use your being discovered. We can erase the 
trail here. First the chair. Get me 
a knife." 



AS 




 



Faber ran and fetched a knife. 
With it, Montag attacked the chair 
where he had sat. He cut the upholstery free, then shoved it, bit 
by bit, without touching the lid, 
into the wall incinerator. "Now," 
he said, "after I leave, rip up the 
carpet. It has my footprints on it. 
Cut it up, burn it, air the house. 
Rub the doorknobs with alcohol. 
After I go, turn your garden sprinkler on full. That'll wash away the 
sidewalk traces." 

Faber shook his hand vigorously. 
"You don't know what this means. 
I'll do anything to help you in the 
future. Get in touch with me in 
Boston, then." 

"One more thing. A suitcase, 
Get it, fill it with your dirty laundry, an old suit, the dirtier the 
better, denim pants maybe, a shirt, 
some old sneakers and socks." 

Faber was gone and back in a 
minute. Montag sealed the full suitcase with scotch tape. "To keep 
the odor in," he said, breathlessly. 
He poured a liberal amount of 
cognac over the exterior of the case. 
"I don't want that Hound picking 
up two odors at once. Mind if I 
take this bottle of whisky? I'll need 
it later. When I get to the river, 
I'll change clothes." 

"And identities; from Montag to 
Faber." 

"Christ, I hope it works! If your 
clothes smell strong enough, which 
God knows they seem to, we might 
confuse the Hound, anyway." 

"Good luck." 



They shook hands again and 
glanced at the t-v. The Electric 
Hound was on its way, followed by 
mobile camera units, through alleys, 
across empty morning streets, silently, silently, sniffing the great 
night wind for Mr. Leonard Montag. 

"Be seeing you!" 

And Montag was out the door, 
running lightly, with the half 
empty case. Behind him, he saw and 
felt and heard the garden sprinkler 
system jump up, filling the dark 
air with synthetic rain to wash away 
the smell of Montag. Through the 
back window, the last thing he saw 
of Faber was the older man ripping 
up the carpet and cramming it in 
the wall incinerator. 

Montag ran. 

Behind him, in the night city, 
the Electric Hound followed. 

HE STOPPED now and again, 
panting, across town, to watch 
through the dimly lighted windows 
of wakened houses. He peered in at 
silhouettes before television screens 
and there on the screens saw where 
the Electric Hound was, now at Elm 
Terrace, now at Lincoln Avenue, 
now at 34th, now up the alley toward Mr. Faber's, now at Faber's! 

"No, no!" thought Montag. "Go 
on past! Don't turn in, don't!" 
He held his breath. 
The Electric Hound hesitated, 
then plunged on, leaving Faber's 
house behind. For a moment the 
t-v camera scanned Faber's home. 



THE FIREMAN 



49 



The windows were dark. In the 
garden, the water sprinkled the 
cool air, softly. 




IHE Electric Hound raced ahead, 
down the alley. 



"Good going, Professor." And 
Montag was gone, again, racing toward the distant river, stopping at 
other houses to see the game on 
the t-v sets, the long running game, 
and the Hound drawing near behind. "Only a mile away now!" 

As he ran he had the Seashell at 
his ear and a voice ran with every 
step, with the beat of his heart and 
the sound of his shoes on gravel. 
"Watch for the pedestrian ! Look 
for the pedestrian ! Anyone on the 
sidewalks or in the street, walking 
or running, is suspect! Watch for 
the pedestrian!" 

How simple in a city where no 
one walked. Look, look for the 
walking man, the man who proves 
his legs. Thank God for good dark 
alleys where men could run in 
peace. House lights flashed on all 
about. Montag saw faces peering 
streetward as he passed behind 
them, faces hid by curtains, pale, 
night-frightened faces, like odd animals peering from electric caves, 
faces with gray eyes and gray 
minds, and he plunged ahead, leaving them to their tasks, and in another minute was at the black, 
moving river. 

He found what he was looking 
for after five minutes of running 
along the bank. It was a rowboat 



drawn and staked to the sand. He 
took possession. 

The boat slid easily on the long 
silence of river and went away 
downstream from the city, bobbing 
and whispering, while Montag 
stripped in darkness down to the 
skin, and splashed his body, his 
arms, his legs, his face with raw 
liquor. Then he changed into 
Faber's old clothing and shoes. He 
tossed his own clothing into the 
river with the suitcase. 

He sat watching the dark shore. 
There would be a delay while the 
pursuit rode the Electric Hound up 
and down stream to see where a 
man named Montag had stepped 
ashore. 

Whether or not the smell of 
Faber would be strong enough, 
with the aid of the alcohol, was 
something else again. He pulled 
out a handkerchief he had saved 
over, doused it with the remainder 
of the liquor. He must hold this 
over his mouth when stepping 
ashore. 

The particles of his breathing 
might remain in an electronically 
detectable invisible cloud for hours 
after he had passed on. 

He couldn't wait any longer. He 
was below the town now, in a lonely place of weeds and old railway 
tracks. He rowed the boat toward 
shore, tied the handkerchief over his 
face, and leaped out as the boat 
touched briefly. 

The current swept the boat 
away, turning slowly. 



50 




 



"Farewell to Mr. Montag," he 
said. "Hello, Mr. Faber." 
He went into the woods. 

HE FOUND his way along railroad tracks that had not been 
used in years, crusted with brown 
rust and overgrown with weeds. He 
listened to his feet moving in the 
long grass. He paused now and 
then, checking behind to see if he 
was followed, but was not. 

Firelight shone far ahead. "One 
of the camps," thought Montag. 
"One of the places where the hobo 
intellectuals cook their meals and 
talk!" It was unbelievable. 

Half an hour later he came out 
of the weeds and the forest into 
the half light of the fire, for only 
a moment, then he hid back and 
waited, watching the group of seven 
men, holding their hands to the 
small blaze, murmuring. To their 
right, a quarter mile away, was the 
river. Up the stream a mile, and 
still apparent in the dark, was the 
city, and no sound except the voices 
and the fire crackling. 

Montag waited ten minutes in 
the shadows. Finally a voice called: 
"All right, you can come out now." 
He shrank back. 
"It's okay," said the voice. 
"You're welcome here." 

He let himself stand forth and 
then he walked tiredly toward the 
fire, peering at the men and their 
dirty clothing. 

"We're not very elegant," said 
the man who seemed to be the 



leader of the little group. "Sit 
down. Have some coffee." 

He watched the dark steaming 
mixture poured into a collapsible 
cup which was handed him straight 
off. He sipped it gingerly. He felt 
the scald on his lips. The men were 
watching him. Their faces were unshaved but their beards were much 
too neat, and their, hands were 
clean. They had stood up, as if to 
welcome a guest, and now they sat 
down again. Montag sipped. 
"Thanks," he said. 

The leader said, "My name is 
Granger, as good a name as any. 
You don't have to tell us your name 
at all." He remembered something. 
"Here, before you finish the coffee, 
better take this." He held out a 
small bottle of colorless fluid. 

"What is it?" 

"Drink it. Whoever you are, you 
wouldn't be here unless you were 
in trouble. Either that, or you're a 
Government spy, in which case we 
are only a bunch of men traveling 
nowhere and hurting no one. In 
any event, whoever you are, an hour 
after you've drunk this fluid, you'll 
be someone else. It does something 
to the perspiratory system — changes 
the sweat content. If you want to 
stay here you'll have to drink it, 
otherwise you'll have to move on. 
If there's a Hound after you, you'd 
be bad company." 

"I think I took care of the 
Hound," said Montag, and drank 
the tasteless stuff. The fluid stung 
his throat. He was sick for a mo

ment; there was a blackness in his 
eyes, and a roaring in his head. 
Then it passed. 

"/TIHAT'S better, Mr. Montag," 
-L said Granger, and snorted at 
his social error. "I beg your pardon — " He poked his thumb at a 
small portable t-v beyond the fire. 
"We've been watching. They videoed a picture of you, not a very 
good resemblance. We hoped you'd 
head this way." 

"It's been quite a chase." 
"Yes." Granger snapped the t-v 
on. It was no bigger than a handbag, weighing some seven pounds, 
mostly screen. A voice from the set 
cried: 

"The chase is now veering south 
along the river. On the eastern 
shore the police helicopters are 
converging on Avenue 87 and Elm 
Grove Park." 

"You're safe," said Granger. 
"They're faking. You threw them 
off at the river, but they can't admit it. Must be a million people 
watching that bunch of scoundrels 
hound after you. They'll catch you 
in five minutes." 

"But if they're ten miles away, 
how can they . . .?" 

"Watch." 

He made the t-v picture brighter. 

"Up that street there, somewhere, 
right now, out for an early morning 
walk. A rarity, an odd one. Don't 
think the police don't know the 
habits of queer ducks like that, men 
who walk early in the morning just 



for the hell of it. Anyway, up that 
street the police know that every 
morning a certain man walks alone, 
for the air, to smoke. Call him 
Billings or Brown or Baumgartner, 
but the search is getting nearer to 
him every minute. See?" 

In the video screen, a man 
turned a corner. The Electric 
Hound rushed forward, screeching. 
The police converged upon the 
man. 

The t-v voice cried, "There's 
Montag now"! The search is over!" 

The innocent man stood watching the crowd come on. In his hand 
was a cigaret, half smoked. He 
looked at the Hound and his jaw 
dropped and he started to say something when a godlike voice boomed, 
"All right,- Montag, don't move! 
We've got you, Montag!" 

By the small fire, with seven 
other men, Mr. Montag sat, ten 
miles removed, the light of the 
video screen on his face. 

"Don't run, Montag!" 

The man turned, bewildered. 
The crowd roared. The Hound 
leaped up. 

"The poor son of a bitch " said 
Granger, bitterly. 

A dozen shots rattled out. The 
man crumpled. 

"Montag is dead, the search is 
over, a criminal is given his due," 
said the announcer. 

The camera trucked forward. 
Just before it showed the dead 
man's face, however, the screen 
went black. 



52 




 



"We now switch you to the Sky 
Room of the Hotel Lux in San 
Francisco for a half hour of dawn 
dance music by — " 

GRANGER turned it off. "They 
didn't show the man's face, 
naturally. Better if everyone thinks 
it's Montag." 

Montag said nothing, but simply 
looked at the blank screen. He could 
not move or speak. 

Granger put out his hand. "Welcome back from the dead, Mr. 
Montag." Montag took the hand, 
numbly. The man said, "My real 
name is Clement, former occupant 
of the T. S. Eliot Chair at Cambridge. That was before it became 
an Electrical Engineering School. 
This gentleman here is Dr. Simmons from U.C.L.A." 

"I don't belong here," said Montag, at last, slowly. "I've been an 
idiot, all the way down the line, 
bungled and messed and tripped 
myself up." 

"Anger makes idiots of us all, 
I'm afraid. You can only be angry 
so long, then you explode and do 
the wrong things. It can't be helped 
now." 

"I shouldn't have come here. It 
might endanger you." 

"We're used to that. We all 
make mistakes, or we wouldn't be 
here ourselves. When we were separate individuals, all we had was 
rage. I struck a fireman in the face, 
once. He'd come to burn my library 
back about forty years ago. I had 



to run. I've been running ever 
since. And Simmons here . . ." 

"I quoted Donne in the midst 
of a genetics class one afternoon. 
For no reason at all. Just started 
quoting Donne. You see ? Fools, all 
of us." 

They glanced at the fire, selfconsciously. 

"So you want to join us, Mr. 
Montag?" 

"Yes." 

"What have you to offer?" 

"Nothing. I thought I had the 
Book of Job, but I haven't even 
got that now." 

"The Book of Job would do very 
well. Where was it?" 

"Here." Montag touched his 
head. 

"Ah," said Granger-Clement. He 
smiled and nodded. 

"What's wrong? Isn't that all 
right?" said Montag. 

"Better than all right — perfect! 
Mr. Montag, you have hit upon the 
secret of, if you want to give it a 
term, our organization. Living 
books, Mr. Montag, living books. 
Inside the old skull where no one 
can see." He turned to Simmons. 
"Do we have a Book of Job?" 

"Only one. A man named Harris 
in Youngstown." 

"Mr. Montag." The man grasped 
Montag's shoulder firmly. "Walk 
slowly, be careful, take your health 
seriously. If anything should happen to Harris, you are the Book of 
Job. Do you see how important you 
are? 



THE FIREMAN

"But I've forgotten it!" 

"Nonsense, nothing is ever forgotten. Mislaid, perhaps, but not 
forgotten. We have ways, several 
new methods of hypnosis, to shake 
down the clinkers there. You'll remember, don't fear." 

"I've been trying to remember." 

"Don't try. Relax. It'll come 
when we need it. Some people are 
quick studies but don't know it. 
Some of God's simplest creatures 
have the ability called eidetic or 
photographic memory, the ability 
to memorize entire pages of print 
at a glance. It has nothing to do 
with I.Q. No offense, Montag. It 
varies. Would you like, one day, to 
read Plato's Republic?" 

"Of course." 

Granger nodded to a man who 
had been sitting to one side. 
"Mr. Plato, if you please." 

THE man began to talk. He 
looked at Montag idly, his 
hands filling a corncob pipe, unaware of the words tumbling from 
his lips. He talked for two minutes 
without a- pause or stumble. 

Granger made the smallest move 
of his fingers. The man cut off. 
"Perfect word-for-word memory, 
every word important, every word 
Plato's," said Granger. 

"And," said the man who was 
Plato, "I don't understand a 
damned word of it. I just say it. 
It's up to yeu to understand." 

"Don't you understand any of 
it?" asked Montag. 

54 



"None of it. But I can't get it 
out. Once it's in, it's like solidified 
glue in a bottle, there for good. Mr. 
Granger says it's important. That's 
good enough for me." 

"We're old friends," said Granger. "We hadn't seen each other 
since we were boys. We met a few 
years ago on that track, somewhere 
between here and Seattle, walking, 
me running away from firemen, he 
running from cities." 

"Never liked cities," said the one 
who was Plato. "Always felt that 
cities owned men, that was all, and 
used, men to keep themselves going, 
to keep machines oiled and dusted. 
So I got out. And then I met 
Granger and he found out that I 
had this eidetic memory, as he calls 
it, and he gave me a book to read 
and then we burned the book ourselves so we wouldn't be caught 
with it. And now I'm Plato; that's 
what I am." 

"He is also Socrates." 

The man nodded. 

"And Schopenhauer." 

Another nod. 

"And John Dewey." 

"All that in one bottle. You 
wouldn't think there was room. But 
I can open my head like a concertina and play it. There's plenty of 
room if you don't try to think about 
what you've memorized. It's when 
you start thinking that all of a 
sudden it's crowded. I don't think 
about anything except eating, sleeping, and traveling. I let you people 
do the thinking when you hear what 


 



I recite. Oh, there's plenty of 
room, believe me." 

"So here we are, Mr. Montag. 
Mr. Simmons is really Mr. John 
Donne and Mr. Charles Darwin 
and Mr. Aristophanes. These other 
gentlemen are Matthew, Mark, 
Luke, and John. And 7 am Ruth." 

Everyone laughed quietly. 

"You see, we are not without 
humor in this melancholy age. I'm 
also bits and pieces, Mr. Montag, 
snatches of Byron and Shelley and 
Shaw and Washington Irving and 
Shakespeare. I'm one of those 
kaleidoscopes. Hold me up to the 
sun, give a shake, watch the patterns. And you are Mr. Job, and 
in half an hour or less, a war will 
begin. While those people in that 
anthill across the river have been 
busy chasing Montag, as if he were 
the cause of all their nervous 
anxiety and frustration, the war has 
been getting under way. By this 
time tomorrow the world will belong to the little green towns and 
the rusted railroad tracks and the 
men walking on them; that's us. 
The cities will be soot and baking 
powder." 

THE t-v rang a bell. Granger 
switched it on. 
"Final negotiations are arranged 
for a conference today with the 
enemy government — " 
Granger snapped it off. 
"Well, what do you think, Montag?" 

"I think I was pretty blind and 



ferocious trying to go at it the way 
I did, planting books and calling 
firemen." 

"You did what you thought you 
had to do. But our way is simpler 
and better and the thing we wish 
to do is keep the knowledge intact 
and safe and not to excite or anger 
anyone; for then, if we are destroyed, the knowledge is most certainly dead. We are model citizens 
in our own special way — we walk 
the tracks, we lie in the hills at 
night, we bother no one, and the 
city people let us be. We're stopped 
and searched for books, occasionally, but we have none, and our 
faces have been changed by plastic 
surgery, as have our fingerprints. So 
we wait quietly for the day when 
the machines are dented junk and 
then we hope to walk by and say. 
'Here we are,' to those who survive 
this war, and we'll say, 'Have you 
come to your senses now? Perhap; 
a few books will do you some 
good.' " 

"But will they listen to you?" 

"Perhaps not. Then we'll have to 
wait some more. Maybe a few hundred years. Maybe they'll never lis 
ten; we can't make them. So we'll 
pass the books on to our children, 
in their minds, and let them wait, 
in turn, on other people. Some day 
someone will need us. This can't 
last forever." 

"How many of you are there?" 

"Thousands on the road, on the 
rails, bums on the outside, libraries 
on the inside. It wasn't really 



THE FIREMAN 



55 



planned; it grew. Each man had a 
book he wanted to remember and 
did. Then we discovered each 
other and over twenty years or so 
got a loose network together and 
made a plan. The important thing 
we had to learn was that we were 
not important, we were not to be 
pedants, we were not to feel superior, we were nothing more than 
covers for books, of no individual 
significance whatever. Some of us 
live in small towns- — chapter one of 
Walden in Nantucket, chapter two 
in Reading, chapter three in Waukesha, each according to his ability. 
Some can learn a few lines, some a 
lot." 

"The books are safe then." 

"Couldn't be safer. Why, there's 
one village in North Carolina, some 
200 people, no bomb'll ever touch 
their town, which is the complete 
Meditations of Marcus Aurelius. 
You could pick up that town, almost, and flip the pages, a page to 
a person. People who wouldn't 
dream of being seen with a book 
gladly memorized a page. You can't 
be caught with that. And when the 
war's over and we've time and need, 
the books can be written again. The 
people will be called in one by one 
to recite what they know and it'll 
be in print again until another Dark 
Age, when maybe we'll have to do 
the whole damned thing over again, 
man being the fool he is." 

"What do we do tonight?" asked 
Montag. 

"Just wait, that's all." 



MONTAG looked at the men's 
faces, old, all of them, in the 
firelight, and certainly tired. Perhaps he was looking for a brightness, a resolve, a triumph over tomorrow that' wasn't really there. 
Perhaps he expected these men to 
be proud with the knowledge they 
carried, to glow with the wisdom 
as lanterns glow with the fire they 
contain. 

But all the light came from the 
campfire here, and these men 
seemed no different than any other 
man who has run a long run, 
searched a long search, seen precious things destroyed, seen old 
friends die, and now, very late in 
time, were gathered together to 
watch the machines die, or hope 
they might die, even while cherishing a last paradoxical love for those 
very machines which could spin 
out a material with happiness in the 
warp and terror in the woof, so 
interblended that a man might go 
insane trying to tell the design to 
himself, and his place in it. 

They weren't at all certain that 
what they carried in their heads 
might make every future dawn 
dawn brighter. They were sure of 
nothing save that the books were 
on file behind their solemn eyes and 
that if man put his mind to them 
properly, something of dignity and 
happiness might be regained. 

Montag looked from one face to 
another. 

"Don't judge a book by its 
cover," said someone. 



56 




 



A soft laughter moved among 
them. 

Montag turned to look at the city 
across the river. 

"My wife's in that city now," he 
said. 

"I'm sorry to hear that." 

"Look," said Simmons. 

Montag glanced up. 

The bombardment was finished 
and over, even while the seeds were 
in the windy sky. The bombs were 
there, the jet-planes were there, for 
the merest trifle of an instant, like 
grain thrown across the heavens by 
a great hand, and the bombs drifted 
with a dreadful slowness down 
upon the morning city where all of 
the people looked up at their destiny coming upon them like the lid 
of a dream shutting tight and become an instant later a red and 
powdery nightmare. 

The bombardment to all military 
purposes was finished. Once the 
planes had sighted their target, 
alerted their bombardier at five 
thousand miles an hour, as quick 
as the whisper of a knife through 
the sky, the war was finished. Once 
the trigger was pulled, once the 
bombs took flight, it was over. 

Now, a full three seconds, all of 
the time in history, before the 
bombs struck, the enemy ships 
themselves were gone, half around 
the visible world, it seemed, like 
bullets in which an island savage 
might not believe because they were 
unseen, yet the heart is struck suddenly, the body falls into separate 

THE FIREMAN 



divisions, the blood is astounded to 
be free on the air, and the brain 
gives up all its precious memories 
and, still puzzled, dies. 

THIS war was not to be believed. 
It was merely a gesture. It was 
the flirt of a great metal hand over 
the city and a voice saying, "Disintegrate. Leave no stone upon another. Perish. Die." 

Montag held the bombs in the 
sky for a precious moment, with his 
mind and his hands. "Run!" he 
cried to Faber. To Clarisse, "Run!" 
To Mildred, "Get out, get out of 
there!" But Clarisse, he remem-. 
bered, was dead. And Faber was 
out; there, in the deep valleys of 
the country, went the dawn train 
on its way from one desolation to 
another. Though the desolation had 
not yet arrived, was still in the air, 
it was as certain as man could make 
it. Before the train had gone another fifty yards on the track, its 
destination would be meaningless, 
its point of departure made from 
a metropolis into a junkyard. 
And Mildred! 

"Get out, run!" he thought. 

He could see Mildred in that 
metropolis now, in the half second 
remaining, as the bombs were perhaps three inches, three small inches 
shy of her hotel building. He could 
see her leaning into the t-v set as if 
all of the hunger of looking would 
find the secret of her sleepless unease there. Mildred, leaning anxiously, nervously, into that tubular 

57 



world as info a crystal ball to find 
happiness. 

The first bomb struck. 

"Mildred I" 

Perhaps the television station 
went first into oblivion. 

Montag saw the screen go dark 
in Mildred's face, and heard her 
screaming, because in the next millionth part of time left, she would 
see her own face reflected there, 
hungry and alone, in a mirror instead of a crystal ball, and it would 
be such a wildly empty face that 
she would at last recognize it, and 
stare at the ceiling almost with 
welcome as it and the entire structure of the hotel blasted down upon 
her, carrying her with a million 



pounds of brick, metal and people 
down into the cellar, there to dispose of them in its unreasonable 
way. 

"I remember now," thought 
Montag, "where we first met. It 
was in Chicago. Yes, now I remember." 

Montag found himself on his 
face. The concussion had knocked 
the air across the river, turned the 
men down like dominoes in a line, 
blown out the fire like a last candle, 
and caused the trees to mourn with 
a great voice of wind passing away 
south. 

Montag lay with his face toward 
the city. Now it, instead of the 
bombs, was in the air. They had

displaced each other. For another 
of those impossible instants the city 
stood, rebuilt and unrecognizable, 
taller than it had ever hoped or 
strived to be, taller than man had 
built it, erected at last in gouts of 
dust and sparkles of torn metal into 
a city not unlike a reversed avalanche, formed of flame and steel 
and stone,' a door where a window 
ought to be, a top for a bottom, a 
side for a back, and then the city 
rolled over and fell. 

The sound of its death came 
after. 

AND Montag lying there, his 
eyes shut, gasping and crying 
out, suddenly thought, "Now I re

member another thing. Now I remember the Book of Job." He said 
it over to himself, lying tight to 
the earth; he said the words of it 
many times and they were perfect 
without trying. "Now I remember 
the book of Job. Now I do remember . . ." 

"There," said a voice, Granger's 
voice. 

The men lay like gasping fish on 
the grass. 

They did not get up for a long 
time, but held to the earth as children hold to a familiar thing, no 
matter how cold or dead, no matter 
what has happened or will happen. 
Their fingers we're clawed into the 
soil, and they were all shouting to 
keep their ears in balance and open, 
Montag shouting with them, a protest against the wind that swept 
them, shaking their hair, tearing at 
their lips, making their noses 
bleed. 

Montag watched the blood drip 
into the earth with such an absorption that the city was effortlessly 
forgotten. 

The wind died. 

The city was flat, as if one had 
taken a heaping tablespoon of flour 
and passed a finger over it, smoothing it to an even level. 

The men said nothing. They lay 
a while like people on the dawn 
edge of sleep, not yet ready to arise 
and begin the day's obligations, its 
fires and foods, its thousand details 
of putting foot after foot, hand 
after hand, its deliveries and func


tions and minute obsessions. They 
lay blinking their stunned eyelids. 
You could hear them breathing 
fast, then slower, then with the 
slowness of normality. 

Montag sat up. He did not move 
any farther, however. The other 
men did likewise. The sun was 
touching the black horizon with a 
faint red tip. The air was cool and 
sweet and smelled of rain. In a few 
minutes it would smell of dust and 
pulverized iron, but now it was 
sweet. 

And across the world, thought 
Montag, the cities of the other nations are dead, too, almost in the 
same instant. 

Silently, the leader of the small 
group, Granger, arose, felt of his 
arms and legs, touched his face to 
see if everything was in its place, 
then shuffled over to the blownout fire and bent over it. Montag 
watched. 

Everyone watched. 

Striking a match, Granger 
touched it to a piece of paper and 
shoved this under a bit of kindling, 
and shoved together bits of straw 
and dry wood, and after a while, 
drawing the men slowly, awkwardly to it by its glow, the fire licked 
up, coloring their faces pink and 
yellow, while the sun rose slowly 
to color their backs. 

THERE was no sound except the 
low and secret talk of men at 
morning, and the talk was no more 
than this: 



60 




 



"How many strips?" 

"Two each." 

"Good enough." 

The bacon was counted out on a 
wax paper. The frying pan was set 
to the fire and the bacon laid in it. 
After a moment it began to flutter 
and dance in the pan and the sputter of it filled the morning air with 
its aroma. Eggs were cracked in 
upon the bacon and ihe men 
watched this ritual, for the leader 
was a participant, as were they, in 
a religion of early rising, a thing 
man had done for many centuries, 
thought Montag, a thing man had 
done over and over again, and Montag felt at ease among them, as if 
during the long night the walls of 
a great prison had vaporized 
around them and they were on the 
land again and only the birds sang 
on or off as they pleased, with no 
schedule, and with no nagging human insistence. 

"Here," said Granger, dishing 
out the bacon and eggs to each 
from the hot pan. They each held 
out the scratched tin plates that had 
been passed around. 

Then, without looking up, 
breaking more eggs into the pan- for 
himself, Granger slowly and with 
a concern both for what he said, recalling it, rounding it, and for 
making the food also, began to recite snatches and rhythms, even 
while the day brightened all about 
as if a pink lamp had been given 
more wick, and Montag listened 
and they all looked at the tin plates 



in their hands, waiting a moment 
for the eggs to cool, while the leader started the routine, and others 
took it up, here or there, round 
about. 

WHEN it was Montag's turn, 
he spoke, too: 

"To everything there is a season, 
And a time to every purpose under 

the heaven . . > . 
A time to be born, and a time to 

die . . . 

A time to kill, and a time to 
heal . . ." 

The forks moved in the pink 
light. Now each of the men remembered a separate and different 
thing, a bit of poetry, a line from 
a play, an old song. And they spoke 
these little bits and pieces in the 
early morning air: 

"Man that is born of a woman 
Is of few days and full of 
trouble . . ." 

A wind blew in the trees. 

"To be or not to be, that is the 
question . . ." 

The sun was fully up. 

"Oh, do you remember, Sweet 
Alice, Ben Bolt . . .?" 

Montag felt fine.
