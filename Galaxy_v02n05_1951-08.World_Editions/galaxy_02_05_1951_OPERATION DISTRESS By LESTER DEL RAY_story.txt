OPERATION DISTRESS By LESTER DEL RAY 



BILL ADAMS was halfway 
back from Mars when he 
noticed the red rash on 
his hands. He'd been reaching for 
one of the few remaining tissues 
to cover a sneeze, while scratching vigorously at the base of his 
neck. Then he saw the red soot, 
and his hand halted, while all 



desire to sneeze gasped out of 
him. 

He sat there, five feet seven 
inches of lean muscle and 
bronzed skin, sweating and staring, while the blond hair on the 
back of his neck seemed to stand 
on end. Finally he dropped his 
hand and pulled himself carefully erect. The cabin in the spaceship was big enough to permit 
turning around, but not much 
more, and with the ship cruising 
without power, there was almost 
no gravity to keep him from 
overshooting his goal. 

He found the polished plate 
that served as a mirror and studied himself. His eyes were puffy, 
his nose was red, and there were 
other red splotches and marks on 
hts face. 

Whatever it was. he had it bad! 

Pictures went through his head, 
all unpleasant. He'd been only a 
kid when the men came back 
from the South Pacific in the 
last war; but an uncle had spent 
years dying of some weird disease that the doctors couldn't 
identify. That had been from 
something caught on Earth. What 
would happen when the disease 
was from another planet? 

It was ridiculous. Mars had no 
animal life, and even the thin 
lichenlike plants were sparse and 
tiny. ^ man couldn't catch a 
disease from a plant. Even horses 
didn't communicate their ills to 
men. Then Bill remembered gangrene " and cancer, which could 
attack any life, apparently. 

He went back to the tiny Geiger-Muller counter, but there was 
no sign of radiation from the big 
atomic motor that powered the 
ship. He stripped his clothes 
off, spotting more of the red

marks breaking out, but finding 
no sign of parasites. He hadn't 
really believed it, anyhow. That 
wouldn't account for the sneezing and sniffles, or the puffed 
eyes and burning inside his nose 
and throat. 

Dust, maybe? Mars had been 
dusty, a waste of reddish sand 
and desert silt that made the Sahara seem like paradise, and it 
had settled on his spacesuit, to 
come in through the airlocks with 
him. But if it contained some irritant, it should have been worse 
on Mars than now. He could remember nothing annoying, and 
he'd turned on the tiny, compact 
little static dust traps, in any 
case, before leaving, to clear the 
air. 

He went back to one of the 
traps now, and ripped the cover 
off it. 

The little motor purred briskly. 
The plastic rods turned against 
fur brushes, while a wiper cleared 
off any dust they picked up. 
There was no dust he could see; 
the traps had done their work. 

Some plant irritant, like poison 
ivy? No, he'd always worn his 
suit — Mars had an atmosphere, 
but it' wasn't anything a man 
could breathe long. The suit was 
put on and off with automatic 
machine grapples, so he couldn't 
have touched it. 

The rash seemed to get worse 
on his body as he looked at it. 

61 



Thir time, he tore one of the tissues in quarters as he sneezed. 
The little supply was almost 
gone; there was never space 
enough for much beyond essentials in a spaceship, even with 
the new atomic drive. As he looked for spots, the burning in his 
nose seemed to increase. 

He dropped back to the pilot 
seat, cursing. Two months of being cramped up in this cubicle, 
sweating out the trip to Mars 
without knowing how the new 
engine would last : three weeks 
on Mars, mapping frantically to 
cover all the territory he could, 
and planting little flags a hundred miles apart; now a week on 
the trip back at high acceleration most of the way — and this! 
He'd expected adventure of some 
kind. Mars, though, had proved 
as interesting as a sandpile, and 
even the "canals" had proved to 
be only mineral striations, invisible from the ground. 

He looked for something to do, 
but found nothing. He'd developed his films the day before, 
after carefully cleaning the static 
traps and making sure the air 
was dust-free. He'd written up 
the accounts. And he'd ■ been 
coasting along on the hope of 
getting home to a bath, a beer, 
and a few bull sessions, before 
he began to capitalize on being 
the first man to reach another 
planet beyond the Moon. 



He cut on full acceleration 
again, more certain of his motors 
than of himself. He'd begun to 
notice the itching yesterday; today he was breaking out in the 
rash. How long would whatever 
was coming take? Good God, he 
might die — from something as 
humiliating and undramatic as 
this! 

It hadn't hit him before, fully. 
There was no knowing about diseases from other planets. Men 
had developed immunity to the 
germs found on Earth; but just 
as smallpox had proved so fatal 
to the Indians and syphilis to 
Europe when they first hit, there 
was no telling how wildly this 
might progress. It might go away 
in a day, or it might kill him 
just as quickly. 

He was figuring his new orbit 
on a tiny calculator. In two days 
at this acceleration, he could 
reach radar-distance of Earth: in 
four, he could land. The tubes 
might burn out in continuous firing. But the other way, he'd be 
two weeks making a landing, and 
most diseases he could remember 
seemed faster than that. 

Bill wiped the sweat off his 
forehead, scratched at other 
places that were itching, and 
stared down at the small disk of 
Earth. There were doctors there 
— and, brother, he'd need them 
fast! 

Things were a little worse 




 



when the first squeals came from 
the radar two days later. He'd 
run out of tissues, and his nose 
was a continual drip, while 
breathing seemed almost impossible. He was running some fever, too, though he had no way 
of knowing how much. 

He cut his receiver in, punched 
out the code on his key. The receiver pipped again at him, bits 
of message getting through, but 
unclearly. There was no response 
to his signals. He checked his 
chronometer and flipped over the 
mtcropages of his Ephemeris; the 
big radar at Washington was still 
out of line with him, and the 
signals had to cut through too 
much air to come clearly. It 
should be good in another hour. 

But right now, an hour seemed 
longer than a normal year. He 
checked the dust tray again, tried 
figuring out other orbits, managed to locate the Moon, and 
scratched. Fifteen minutes. There 
was no room for pacing up and 
down. He pushed the back down 
from the pilot seat, lowered the 
table, and pulled out his bunk; 
he remade it, making sure all the 
corners were perfect. Tben he 
folded it back and lifted the 
table and seat. That took less 
than five minutes. 

His hands were shaking worse 
when the automatic radar signals 
began to come through more 
clearly. It wasn't an hour, but he 



could wait no longer. He opened 
the key and began to send. It 
would take fifteen seconds for 
the signal to reach Earth, and another quarter minute for an answer, even if an operator was on 
duty. 

Half a minute later, he found 
one was. "Earth to Mars Rocket 
I. Thank God, you're ahead of 
schedule. If your tubes hold out, 
crowd them. Two other nations 
have ships out now. The U. N. 
has ruled that whoever comes 
back first with mapping surveys 
can claim the territory mapped. 
We're rushing the construction, 
but we need the ship for the second run if we're to claim our fair 
territory. Aw, hell — congratula^ 
tions!" 

He'd started hammering at his 
key before they finished, giving 
the facts on the tubes, which 
were standing up beyond all ex-, 
pectations. "And get a doctor 
ready — a bunch of them," he finished. "1 seem to have picked up 
something like a disease." 

There was a long delay before 
an answer came this time — more 
than five minutes. The hand on. 
the key was obviously different* 
slower and not as steady. "What 
symptoms, Adams? Give all details!" 

He began, giving all the information he had, from the first 
itching through the rash and the 
fever. Again, longer this time, the 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



main station hesitated. 

"Anything I can do about it 
now?" Bill asked, finally. "And 
how about having those doctors 
ready?" 

"We're checking with Medical," the signals answered, 
"We're . . . Here's their report. 
Not enough data — could be anything. Do2ens of diseases like 
that. Nothing you can do, except 
try salt water gargle and spray; 
you've got stuff for that. Wash 
off rash with soap and hot water, 
followed by some of your hypo. 
We'll get a medical kit up to the 
Moon for you." 

He let that sink in, then clicked back: "The Moon?" 

"You think you can land here 
with whatever you've got, man? 
There's no way of knowing how 
contagious it is. And keep an 
hourly check with us. If you 
pass out, we'll try to get someone out in a Moon rocket to pick 
you up. But we can't risk danger 
of infecting the whole planet. 
You're quarantined on the Moon 
— we'll send up landing instructions later — not even for Luna 
Base, but where there will be no 
chance of contamination for others. You didn't really expect to 
come back here, did you, Adams?" 

He should have thought of it. 
He knew that. And he knew that 
the words from Earth weren't as 
callous as they sounded. Down 



there, men would be sweating 
with him, going crazy trying to 
do something. But they were 
right. Earth had to be protected 
first; Bill Adams was only one 
out of two and a half billions, 
even if he had reached a planet 
before any other man. 

Yeah, it was fine to be a hero. 
But heroes shouldn't menace the 
rest of the world. 

Logically, he knew they were 
right. That helped him get his 
emotions under control. "Where 
do you want me to put down?" 

"Tycho. It isn't hard to spot 
for radar-controlled delivery of 
supplies to you, but it's a good 
seven hundred miles from Lunar 
Base. And look — we'll try to get 
a doctor to you. But keep us informed if anything slips. We need 
those maps, if we can find a way 
to sterilize 'em." 

"Okay," h e acknowledged. 
"And tell the cartographers there 
are no craters, no intelligence, 
and only plants about half an 
inch high. Mars stinks." 

They'd already been busy, he 
saw, as he teetered down on his 
jets for a landing on Tycho. 
Holding control was the hardest 
job he'd ever done. A series of 
itchings cropped out just as the 
work got tricky, when he could 
no longer see the surface, and 
had to go by feel. But somehow 
he made it. Then he relaxed and 
began an orgy of scratching.

And he'd thought there was 
something romantic about being 
a hero! 

The supplies that had already 
been sent up by the superfast 
unmanned missiles would give 
him something to do, at least. 
He moved back the two feet 
needed to reach his developing 
tanks and went through the process of spraying and gargling. It 
was soothing enough while it 
went on, but it offered only momentary help. 

Then his stomach began showing distress signs. He fought 
against it, tightening up. It did 
no good. Hts hasty breakfast of 
just black coffee wanted to come 
Up — and did, giving him barely 
time to make the little booth. 

He washed his mouth out and 
grabbed for the radar key, banging out a report on this. The doctors must have been standing by 
down at the big station, because 
there was only a slight delay 
before the answering signal came: 
"Any blood?" 

Another knot added itself to 
his intestines. "I don't know — 
don't think so, but I didn't look." 

"Look, next time. We're trying to get this related to some of 
the familiar diseases. It must 
have some relation — there are 
only so many ways a man can 
be sick. We've got a doctor coming over, Adams. None on the 
Moon, but we're shipping him 



through. He'll set down in about 
nine hours. And there's some 
stuff to take on the supply missiles. Ma y not help, but we're 
trying a mixture of the antibU 
otics. Also some ACS and anodynes for the itching and rash* 
Hope they work. Let us know 
any reaction." 

Bill cut off. He'd have to try. 
They were as much in the dark 
about this as he was, but they 
had a better background for 
guessing and trial and error. And 
if the bugs in him happened to 
like tachiomycetin, he wouldn't 
be too much worse off. Damn it, 
had there been blood? 

He forced his mind off it, 
climbed into his clothes and then 
into the spacesuit that hung from 
the grapples. It moved automatically into position, the two halves 
sliding shut and sealing from outside. The big gloves on his hands 
were too clumsy for such operations. 

Then he went bounding across 
the Moon. Halfway to the supplies he felt the itching come 
back, and he slithered and wriggled around, trying to scratch his 
skin against his clothing. It didn't 
help much. He was sweating 
harder, and his eyes were watering. He manipulated the little 
visor-cleaning gadget, trying to 
poke his face forward to brush 
the frustration tears from his 
eyes. He couldn't quite reach it. 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



There were three supply mis- They were really shooting the 
siles, each holding about two nun- pharmacy at him. He injected 
dred pounds, Earth weight. He himself, swallowed things, rubtied them together and slung bed himself down with others, 
them over his back, heading to- and waited. Whatever they'd 
ward his ship. Here they weighed given him didn't offer any immeonly a hundred pounds, and with diate help. He began to feel 
his own weight and the suit add- worse. But on contacting Earth 
ed, the whole load came to little by radar, he was assured that 
more than his normal weight on that might be expected. 
Earth. 

He tried shifting the supplies 
around on his back, getting them 
to press against the spots of torment as he walked. It simply unbalanced him, without really relieving the itching. Fortunately, 
though, his eyes were clearing a 
little. He gritted his teeth and 
fought back through the powdery pumice surface, kicking up 
clouds of dust that settled slowly but completely — though the 
gravity was low, there was no 
air to hold them up. 

Nothing had ever looked better than the airlock of the ship. 
He let the grapples hook the suit 
off him as soon as the outer seal 
was shut and went into a whirling dervish act. Aches and pains 
could be stood — but itching! 

Apparently, though, the spray 
and gargle had helped a little, 
since his nose felt somewhat 
clearer and his eyes were definitely better. He repeated them, 
and then found the medical supplies, with a long list of instructions.

"We've got another missile 
coming, with metal foil for the 
maps and photos — plus a small 
copying camera. You can print 
them right on the metal, seal that 
in a can, and leave it for the 
rocket that's bringing the doctor. 
The pilot will blast over it — that 
should sterilize it— and pick it up 
when it cools." 



Bill swore, but he was in his 
suit when the missile landed, 
heading out across the pumicecovered wastes toward it. The 
salves had helped the itching a 
little, but not much. And his nose 
had grown worse again. 

He jockeyed the big supply 
can out of the torpedo-shaped 
missile, packed it on his back, 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



6? 



and headed for his ship. The 
itching was acting up as he sweated — this made a real load, about 
like packing a hundred bulky 
pounds over his normal Earth 
weight through the soft drift of 
the pumice. But his nose was 
clearing again; it was apparently 
becoming cyclic. He'd have to 
relay that information back to 
the medics. And where were they 
getting a doctor crazy enough to 
take a chance with him? 

He climbed out of the suit and 
went through the ritual of 
scratching, noticing that his fever had gone up, and that his 
muscles were shaking. His head 
seemed light, as if he were in for 
a spell of dizziness. They'd be 
interested in that, back on Earth, 
though it wouldn't do much good. 
He couldn't work up a clinical 
attitude about himself. AH he 
wanted was a chance to get over 
this disease before it killed him. 

He dragged out the photo and 
copying equipment, under a red 
light. It filled what little space 
was left in his cubbyhole cabin. 
Then he swore, gulping down 
more of the pills where they 
were waiting for him. The metal 
sheets were fine. They were excellent. The only thing wrong 
was that they wouldn't fit his 
developing trays — and they were 
tough enough to give him no way 
of cutting them to size. 

He stuffed them back in their 

** 



container and shoved it into the 
airlock. Then his stomach kicked 
up again. He couldn't see any 
blood in the result, but he 
couldn't be sure — the color of the 
pills might hide traces. He flushed 
it down, his head turning in circles, and went to the radar. This 
time he didn't even wait for a 
reply; let them worry about their 
damned maps. They could send 
cutting equipment with the doctor and pick up the things later. 
They could pick up his corpse 
and cremate it at the same time, 
for all he cared right now. 

He yanked out his bunk and 
slumped into it, curling up as 
much as the itching would permit. And finally, for the first time 
in over fifty hours, he managed 
to doze off, though his sleep was 
full of nightmares. 

It was the sound of the bullthroated chemical rocket that 
brought him out of it — the sound 
traveling along the surface 
through the rocks and up through 
the metal ship, even without air 
to carry it. 

He could feel the rumble of 
its takeoff later, but he waited 
long after that for the doctor. 
There was no knock on the port. 
Finally he pulled himself up from 
the bunk, sweating and shaken, 
and looked out. 

The doctor was there — or at 
least a man in a spacesuit was. 
But somebody had been in a frur
t A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



ry for volunteers, and given the 
man no basic training at all. The 
figure would pull itself erect, 
make a few strides that were all 
bounce and no progress, and then 
slide down into the pumice. 
Moon-walking was tricky until 

you learned how. 

Bill sighed, scratching unconsciously, and made his way somehow out to his suit, climbing into 
it. He paused for a final good 
scratch, and then the grapples 
took over. This time, he stumbled also as he made his way 
across the powdery rubble. But 
the other man was making no 
real progress at all. 

Bill reached him, and touched 
helmets long enough to issue simple instructions through metal 
sound conduction. Then he managed to guide the other's steps; 
there had been accounts of the 
days of learning spent by the 
first men on the Moon, but it 
wasn't that bad with an instructor to help. The doctor picked up 
as they went along. Bill's legs 
were buckling under him by then, 
and the itches were past endurance. At the end, the doctor was 
hrlping him. But somehow they 
made the ship, and were getting 
out of the suits — Bill first, then 
the doctor, using the grapples 
under Bill's guidance. 

The doctor was young, and obviously scared, but fighting his 
fear. He'd been picked for his 



smallness to lighten the load on 
the chemical rocket, and his little face was intent. But he managed a weak grin. 

"Thanks, Adams, I'm Doctor 
Ames — Ted to you. Get onto that 
cot. You're about out on your 
feet." 

The test he made didn't take 
long, but his head was shaking 
at the conclusion. 

"Your symptoms make no 
sense," he summarized. "I've got 
a feeling some are due to one 
thing, some to another. Maybe 
we'll have to wait until I come 
down with it and compare notes."' 

His grin was wry, but Bill was 
vaguely glad that he wasn't trying any bedside manner. There 
wasn't much use in thanking the 
man for Volunteering — Ames had 
known what he was up against, 
and he might be scared, but his 
cfeurage was above thanks. 

"What about the maps?" Bill 
asked. "They tell you?" 

"They've left cutters outside. 
I started to bring them. Then the 
pumice got me — I couldn't stand 
upright in it. They'll pick up the 
maps later, but they're important. The competing ships will 
claim our territory if we don't 
file first." 

He knocked the dust off his instrument, and wiped his hands. 
Bill looked down at the bed to 
see a fine film of Moon silt there. 
They'd been bringing in too much 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



on the suits — it was too fine, and 
the traps weren't getting it fast 
enough. 

He got up shakily, moving toward the dust trap that had been 
running steadily. But now it was 
out of order, obviously, with the 
fur brushes worn down until they 
could generate almost no static 
against the rod. He groped into 
the supplies, hoping there would 
be replacements. 

Ames caught his arm. "Cut it 
out, Adams. You're in no shape 
for this. Hey, how long since 
you've eaten?" 

Bill thought it over, his head 
thick. "I had coffee before I 
landed." 

Doctor Ames nodded quickly. 
"Vomiting, dizziness, tremors, excess sweating — what did you expect, man? You put yourself under this strain, not knowing what 
comes next, having to land wifch 
an empty stomach, skipping 
meals and loading your stomach 
wiUh pills — and probably no 
sleep! Those symptoms are perfectly normal." 

He was at the tiny galley 
equipment, fixing quick food as 
he spoke. But his face was still 
sober. He was probably thinking 
of the same thing that worried 
Bill — an empty stomach didn't 
make the itching rash, the runny 
nose and eyes, and the general 
misery that had begun the whole 
thing. 



He sorted through the stock 
of replacement parts, a few fieldsistors, suit wadding, spare 
gloves, cellophane -wrapped gadgets. Then he had it. Ames was 
over, urging him toward the cot, 
but he shook him off. 

"Got to get the dust out of 
here — dust'Il make the itching 
worse. Moon dust is sharp, Doc. 
Just install new brushes . . . 
Where are those instructions? 
Yeah, insert the cat's fur brushes 
under the . . . Cat's fur? Is that 
what they use, Doc?" 

"Sure. It's cheap and generates static electricity. Do you expect sable?" 

Bill took the can of soup and 
sipped it without tasting or thinking, his hand going toward a 
fresh place that itched. His nose 
began running, but he disregarded it. He still felt lousy, but 
strength was flowing through 
him, and life was almost good 
again. 

He tossed the bunk back into 
its slot, lifted the pilot's stool, 
and motioned Ames forward. 
"You operate a key — hell, I am 
getting slow. You can contact 
Luna Base by phone, have them 
relay. There. Now tell 'em I'm 
blasting off pronto for Earth, and 
ril be down in four hours with 
their plans." 

"You're crazy." The words 
were flat, but there was desperation on the little doctor's face. 




 



He glanced about hastily, taking 
the microphone woodenly. "Adams, they'll have an atomic bomb 
up to blast you out before you're 
near Earth. They've got to protect themselves. You can't . . ." 

Bill scratched, but there was 
the beginning of a grin on his 
face. "Mope, I'm not delirious 
now, though I damn near cracked 
up. You figured out half the 
symptoms. Take a look at those 
brushes — cat's fur brushes — and 
figure what they'll do to a man 
who was breathing the air and 
who is allergic to cats! All I ever 
had was some jerk in Planning 
who didn't check my medical 
record with trip logistics! I never 
had these symptoms until I unzipped the traps and turned *em 
on. It got better whenever I was 
in the suit, breathing canned air. 
We should have known a man 
can't catch a disease from 
plants." 

The doctor looked at him, and 



at the fur pieces he'd thrown 
into a wastebin, and the whiteness ran from his face. He was 
seeing his own salvation, and t lie 
chuckle began weakly, gathering 
strength as he turned to the microphone. 

"Cat asthma — simple allergy. 
Who'd figure you'd get that in, 
deep space? But you're right. 
Bill. It figures." 

Bill Adams nodded as he 
reached for the controls, and the 
tubes began firing, ready to take 
them back to Earth. Then he 
caught himself and swung to the 
doctor. 

"Doc," he said quickly, "just 
be sure and tell them this isn't 
to get out. If they'll keep still 
about it, so will I." 

He'd make a hell of a hero on 
Earth if people heard of it, and 
he could use a little of a hero's 
reward. 

No catcalls, thanks.
