THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN By SYLVIA JACOBS 

THE Ambassador from Outer Space sprang to his feet, 
taking Jerry's extended 
hand in a firm, warm grasp. Jerry 
had been prepared for almost 
anything — a scholarly brontosaurus, perhaps, or an educated 
squid or giant caterpillar with 
telepathic powers." But the Ambassador didn't even have antennae, gills, or green hair. He was 
a completely normal and even 
handsome human being. 

"Scotch? Cigar?" the Ambassador offered cordially. "How can 
I help you, Mr. Jergins?" 

Studying him, Jerry decided 
there was something peculiar 
about this extraterrestial, after

all He was too perfect. His shave 
was too close, his skin so unblemished as to suggest waxworks. Every strand of his distinguished iron-gray hair was impeccably placed. The negligent 
and just-right drape of his 
clothes covered a body shaped 
like a Sixth Century B.C. piece 
of Greek sculpture. No mere human could have look so unruffled, 
so utterly groomed, at three 
o'clock in the afternoon, in a 
busy office. A race, Jerry wondered, capable of taking any 
shape at will, in mimicry of the 
indigenous race of any planet? 

'"You can help me, but I'm not 
sure you will" Jerry said. "The 
rumor is that you won't do anything to ease this buyers* strike 
you started on Earth." 

The Ambassador smiled. 
"You're a man who's hot used 
to taking no for an answer, I 
gather. What's your proposition?" 

"I'd like to contact some of the 
firms on the Federated Planets, 
show them how I could promote 
their merchandise on Earth. 
Earth is already clamoring for 
their goods. To establish a medium of exchange, we'd have to run 
simultaneous campaigns,- promoting Earth merchandise on other 
planets." 

"That would be difficult, even 
fof a man of your promotional 
ability," the Ambassador said 
wirmingly. "You see, Earth is the 



only planet we've yet discovered 

where advcrtising^-or promotion, 
to use the broader term — exists 
as a social and economic force." 

"How in hell can anybody do 
business without it?" Jerry demanded. 

"We don't do business in the 
sense you mean. Don't mistake 
me," the Ambassador added 
hastily, "we don't have precisely 
a communal economy, either. Our 
very well defined sense of ethics 
in regard to material goods is 
something I find impossible to 
describe in any Earth language. 
It's quite simple, so simple that 
you have to grow up with it to 
understand it. Our whole attitude 
toward material goods is conditioned by the Matter Repositor." 

"That gadget!" Jerry said bitterly. "It was when you first mentioned it before the U.N. Assembly that all this trouble on Earth 
started. Everybody and his brother hopes that tomorrow he can 
buy a Matter Repositor, and never have to buy anything again. I 
came here mostly to ask you 
whether it's really true, that if 
you have one of those dinguses, 
you can bring anything you want 
into your living room.'" 

"You can. In practice, of 
course, repositing just anything 
that took your fancy would produce economic anarchy." 

"Let's put it this way," Jerry 
persisted. "Home appliances were 



74

my biggest accounts. Now, when 
we try to sell a refrigerator, the 
prospect says she's saving her 
cash till Matter Repositors get on 
the Earth market. She plans to 
reposit a refrigerator — not from 
her neighbor's kitchen, because 
that would be stealing — but from 
the factory. If the factory goes 
bust, people figure the government will have to subsidize building appliances. Now, could she 
really reposit a refrigerator?" 

"She could. But she wouldn't 
want to." 

"Why not?" Jerry asked, puzzled. 

"If she conceived an illogical 
and useless desire for food refrigeration, she would simply reposit a block of cold, air from, 
say, the North Pole." 

"Oh, fine!" Jerry said sarcastically. "That would cause more 
unemployment in the refrigerator 
industry than repositing them 
without paying for them! But 
what do you mean about food refrigeration being illogical and 
useless?" 

"Well, in a storage warehouse, 
there might be some reason for 
food preservation. But you don't 
need cold or canning. Why not 
j ust reposit the bacteria that 
cause the food to deteriorate ? 
There's no need to store food in 
a home equipped with a Matter 
Repositor. You simply reposit one 
meal at a time. Fruits and vege


tables direct from tree or field. 
Meat from a slaughterhouse, since 
it isn't humane to remove a pound 
of steak from a live steer. But 
even this is needless." 

"Why?" Jerry bafflcdly wanted ' 
to know. 

"To free the maximum amount 
of the effort of thinking beings 
for non-material activities, each 
consumer can reposit the chemical elements of the food, synthesize his meal on the table. He 
can even reposit these elements 
directly into his stomach, or, to 
by -pass the effort of digestion, 
into his bloodstream as glycogen 
and amino acids." 

"So refrigerators would be as 
dead an item as kerosene lamps 
in a city wired for electricity," 
Jerry agreed unhappily. "Suppose 
Mrs. Housewife, not needing a 
refrigerator, reposits a washing 
machine. The point I'm driving at 
■ — is there any practical way to 
compensate the factory, give it an 
incentive to produce more washing machines, without dragging 
in government control?" 

"Why should the factory, produce more washing machines? 
Who would want one? The housewife would simply reposit the 
dirt from her clothes into her 
flowerbed, without using water 
and soap. Or, more likely, reposit new clothes with different 
colors, fabrics, and styles. The 
Matter Repositor would eliminate 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



75 



textile mills and clothing factories. Earth's oceans have vast 
enough, quantities of seaweed to 
eliminate the growing of cotton, 
wool, or flax. Or. again, you could 
reposit the chemical elements, 
either from the soil or from seawater." 

Jerry pondered the extensive 
implications of these revelations. 
Finally he said, "What it boils 
down to is this. All Earth's bustling material activity, all the logging and construction, the mining 
and manufacturing, the planting 
'and fishing, the printing and postal service, the great transportation 
and shipping effort, the cleaning 
^nd painting, the sewage disposal, 
even the bathing and self-adornment, consist, when you analyze 
them, of one process only — putting something hop* where you 
don't want it to where you do. 
There's, not one single, solitary 
Earth invention or service left to 
advertise!" 

"Nothing," the Ambassador 
agreed. "Which is exactly why 
advertising has not developed on 
the Federated Planets. You're 
fortunate that Earth doesn't have 
Matter Repository. You'd be out 
of a job if it did." 

"Oh, no!" Jerry said. "I could 
still advertise the gadget to end 
all gadgets — the Matter Repositor 
itself. I know other people have 
Vsked you this before, but could 
'an Earth company get a franchise 



to import those machines here, or 
the license rights to manufacture 
them?" 

"No," the Ambassador said, 
briefly and definitely. 

"Mr. Ambassador/' Jerry protested, "you've gone to a lot of 
trouble to explain things you 
must already be tired of explaining to Earthmen, just so I personally could be sure they weren't 
merely rumors or misinterpretations. Now that I get down to the 
real point, you suddenly become 
blunt and unqualified. Why?" 

"Because there's a very serious 
question of ethics involved, wherever a more advanced civilization 
comes in contact with a relatively 
primitive one. For instance, when 
the white men came to America, 
the aborigines were introduced to 
gunpowder and firewater." 

"So you people are keeping 
Matter Repositors away from us, 
like a mama keeping candy away 
from a baby who's hollering for 
it, because it's not good for him! 
You'd pass up a chance to name 
your own price — " 

"The very way you phrase that 
remark indicates the danger. You 
regard personal gain as the 
strongest of motives, which means 
that Matter Repositors would be 
used for that, even by such unusually intelligent members of your 
race as yourself." 

"Don't softsoap me," Jerry said 
angrily. "Not after you just got 



?4 




 



through saying that we Earthlings are nothing but naked savages, compared to the high and 
mighty super-beings on other 
planets!" 

"I apologize for my phraseology," the Ambassador said. "With 
my limited command of your language — " 

"Your limited command, nuts! 
I suppose you supermen enjoy 
seeing us naked savages squirm. 
Why talk sanctimoniously about 
the damage you might do, when 
you know damn well the damage 
has already been done? Just the 
news that something as advanced 
as the Matter Repositor exists has 
sent unemployment to a new 
high, and the stock market to a 
new low. And you theorize about 
ethics, while denying us the only 
cure!" Jerry found himself fighting a nearly irresistible impulse 
to smash his fist into that tooperfect profile — which, he realized 
glumly, would only prove the 
Ambassador's point about savages. 

"Here, here," the Ambassador 
said benevolently, "let's have another drink. Then we'll see whether I can make it clear to you why 
the actual imjiortation of Matter 
Repositors would cause much 
more trouble on Earth than the 
announcement of their existence, 
bad as the effect of that has been. 
To begin with, I admit I made a 
wery serious error in mentioning 



the device at all before the U.N. 
Assembly. I intended merely to 
explain how I came here without 
a spaceship- After that, I was 
flooded with questions; I could 
no more avoid answering them 
than I could courteously avoid 
answering the questions you've 
been asking today." 

"You mean you super- beings 
actually admit you're human 
enough to make mistakes?" Jerry 
asked, somewhat moll i lied. 

"Of course we make mistakes. 
We try not to make the same one 
twice. You see, we once made the 
mistake of importing Matter Repositors to a planet whose natural 
resources and social concepts 
weren't adequate for the device. 
That was a long time ago, and 
they haven't recovered from the 
effects yet. Suppose a consignment of ten thousand Matter Repositors arrived on Earth tomorrow. Under your economic system, who would get them?" 

"The ten thousand people or 
corporations who had the most 
money to pay for them, I guess. 
Unless government agencies grabbed 'em." 

"Can you guarantee that of the 
ten thousand people on Earth who 
have the most money, not one is 
unscrupulous?" 

"Gosh, no!" Jerry said. "I don't 
think there's any doubt that to 
stay in business very long, a man 
or a company has to have a cer


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



77 



tain amount of business ethics. 
Nobody can gyp the public indefinitely. But a bank robber 
might have a lot of cash, or a 
confidence man, or a cluck with 
a big inheritance." 

"So, to be generous, let's assume that 9,999 of your wealthiest persons are so ethical that 
they would never make any profit 
at the expense of the general welfare. That leaves us one crook. 
What would he reposit first?" 

"Hmra . . . Maybe the gold at 
Fort Knox." 

"And what effect would that 
have on Earth*s business?" 

"I'm not quite sure," Jerry admitted. "I'm no shark on monetary theory, just the kind of largescale salesman who makes mass 
production possible. But it certainly wouldn't do the world situation any good." 

"Suppose, next, our crook holds 
the President of the United States 
for ransom. Since he doesn't need 
money, the ransom price might 
be laws which would grant him 
impunity for his crimes. If not, 
he could have an accomplice reposit him out of jail, or even out 
of the electric chair, before the' 
switch was pulled." 

"That's enough! I get the idea!" 
Jerry exclaimed. 

"Wait — there's a more important point. Suppose a government 
you consider the wrong government got hold of some of the ma


chines. First, of course, they'd reposit the world * stockpile of 
atomic bombs. Then they'd reposit disease bacteria into the 
bloodstreams of U.N. troops, officials, and civilian workers, and 
reposit all the ammunition out of 
U.N. guns. So long as there is one 
spark of nationalism left on 
Earth, so long as any country has 
an economic and political system 
they consider better than some 
other system, Matter Repositors 
would mean planetary self-destruction. Now do you see why I 
was blunt and unqualified?" 

"I do," Jerry said solemnly, 
"And I was a fool to fly off the 
handle when you called us savages. We are savages, I can see 
that now. And your people must 
be pretty damned godlike to be 
trusted with such an invention!" 

"Not at all. To a Micronesian 
bushman, the pilot who can be 
trusted with the power and speed 
of a B-29 seems a veritable god. 
But the pilot is only an ordinary 
Joe, very likely no more intelligent than the bushman- — he just 
had a different background. 
Fighting each other for necessities and luxuries, the process that 
you people call business competition, has so long been needless to 
our people that they would no 
more think of competitive gain 
than you would do an Indian 
harvest dance before you signed 
a contract. They aren't necessarily 



7« 




 



more intelligent or more virtuous 
than your people — they just have 
a different background." 

"You seem to have devoted a 
lot of study to the larceny in the 
Earthman's soul," Jerry put in. 
"What if we stole the secret from 
you, whether you think it wise to 
give it to us or not ? Suppose 
somebody swiped the blueprints, 
or copied a Repositor you brought 
with you for your own use?" 

The Ambassador smiled. "You 
might try to steal it. That's why 
[ didn't bring a Repositor with 
me, to save you people the trouble 
of a futile try." 

"Why futile?" 

"Well, the Matter Repositor is 
a simple device. Any child on the 
Federated Planets who had an 
education, say, equivalent to youj 
technical high school education, 
could build a working model, even 
without another Repositor to assist him. But Earth's best technicians couldn't build one, even 
with cither blueprints or a model 
to copy." 

"They couldn't, eh?" Jerry 
challenged, bristling again. "They 
managed to split atoms, transmute elements, do a few little 

, tricks like that." 

"I see I've been tactless again," 
the Ambassador said regretfully. 
"Just now. you readily conceded 

i that Earthmen are savages morally, but when I seem to cast aspersions on your mechanical abil


ity, it offends your racial vanity. 
All right, let's go back to the B-29 
pilot and the intelligent bushman. 
The internal combustion engine 
that powers the B-29 is a simple 
device in fundamental principle, 
isn't it?" 

"Sure," Jerry said. 

"Any high school boy who has 
taken a course in auto mechanics, 
who has the requisite machine 
tools, metals, casting equipment, 
and fuel, could build a working 
model of an internal combustion 
engine, couldn't he, even without 
ready-made parts?" 

"I f he wasn' t all thumbs, he 
could." 

"All right. Now suppose the 
B-29 is grounded in the jungle. 
The bushman is examining the 
engine. He's just as intelligent as 
the pilot, remember, but his environment hasn't produced an oil 
well, let alone a refinery. He has 
never seen a lathe or a micrometer. Hr has no mine, no smelter. 
He can't copy that B-29 engine 
by whittling wood or chipping 
stone, even if he's a born mechanical genius, and he can't run it on 
seawater. So he says the plane 
flies by magic. Put him in the 
pilot seat, and you'll admit it's 
practically inevitable that he'll 
crash.'" 

"Why do you take so much 
trouble to explain things?" Jerry 
asked wryly. "I should have my 
head examined for not under 


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



79 



standing it in the first place.** 

"Let's say I'm feebly trying to 
make amends for what my unfortunate slip of the tongue has 
done to your business." 

"You've brought me around to 
your way of thinking, Mr. Ambassador," Jerry said, recovering 
enough to carry the ball. "But it 
would be impossible to sell the 
public on the idea that they 
shouldn't have Repositors because 
they're too hot to handle. Statistics on auto accidents never 
convinced anybody that he didn't 
want a nice, shiny, new car. Nobody thinks he personally will 
fget killed in traffic — he's too 
smart. You can't convince a 
youngster he doesn't want candy 
before dinner; he thinks he knows 
better than his parents. But you 
can hide the candy, while putting 
an appetizing meal on the table." 

"Yes, except that I regrettably 
didn't hide the fact that the Matter Repositor exists." ^ 

"You sure didn't. And it puts 
you "ffh a spot, doesn't it? I don't 
imagine it will be much fun for 
you to report to your government 
that one ill-considered remark, 
made shortly after your arrival, 
upset Earth's economy." 

For the first time, the Ambassador's suavity was ruffled. Sweat 
stood out on his noble forehead. 
"I've been hoping the bad-effects 
would die down before I have to 
report," he confessed. 



"They won't die down by themselves. You know damned well 
they're getting worse and worse, 
as word - of - mouth advertising 
about the Matter Repositor 
spreads." Jerry leaned closer. 
"But you and I can get rid of 
those bad effects." 

"How?" 

"Well, I'll tell you. When I 
came to see you, I was pretty sure 
you'd turn me down cold on importing Matter Repositors. But I 
had an ace up my sleeve. I hoped 
you would admit that the reason, 
you've been stalling on selling 
Earth any Repositors is that you 
don't really have a practical one. 
I thought maybe rumors of the 
Repositor's powers had been vastly exaggerated. If you admitted 
that, I intended to publicize it to 
the limit. A campaign to convince 
Earthmen that you'd been kidding 
them would work, because it 
"plays on John Q. Public's conviction that he's pretty smart, too 
smart to believe all this gab about 
a gadget he's never seen. With 
your denial to back me up, I 
could put it across. It would be 
a lifesaving shot in the arm for 
Earth business." 

"You mean," the Ambassador 
said reflectively, "that if I call 
myself a liar — if I actually become a liar in so doing — I can 
patch up the damage I've done? 
That puts me in a difficult ethical 
position," 



to

"Not as difficult as the one 
you're in now. If it will make it 
easier for you, I can word your 
dental in a face-saving way, and 
have it ready for your signature 
Tuesday. You have a remarkable 
command of colloquial English, 
but even a diplomat using his 
native tongue can't juggle the 
connotations and inferences like 
an advertising man." 

"It's very kind of you to offer 
your professional skill in my behalf. I think I should pay you a 
fee for the copy." 

"Skip it," Jerry said generously, fingering the nickel and two 
pennies in his pocket. "A small 
token of my appreciation for the 
patience you've shown. What time 
Tuesday?" 

"Say two o'clock?" 

"Fine. But before I spend my 
time on this, you're not going to 
make the same deal with somebody else, are you?" 

"Deal? Did I make a'deal?" 

"What I mean, nobody else has 
approached you with the idea 
that Earth business would get 
back to normal if you would 
deny that a practical Matter Repositor exists? You'd say I have 
exclusive rights to the idea?" 

"Nobody has," the Ambassador 
said, "and I agree to give you 
exclusive rights." 

"Good! With your signed denial, I can raise the loot. I think 
the N.A.M. will go for it. The 



campaign will have to be wellfinanced, you see; the amount of 
space the news columns will give 
to your dental may be as much 
as they gave to your original 
statement, but that alone won't 
do the job. It's much harder to 
kill a notion that has penetrated 
the public mind than it is to implant one." 

iHE Ambassador indulged in ft 
chuckle. "I'm beginning to see 
daylight. My signed denial in 
your hands becomes a salable 
piece of merchandise, worth far 
more than I would pay you for a 
few lines of copy. Well, more 
power to you! Would it be out of 
place for me to contribute some of 
the funds for publicizing this denial?" 

"How much?" Jerry asked 
practically. 

"Well," the Ambassador explained, "I've had nothing reposited that I could avoid. But 
since your planet has a monetary 
exchange, I had to pay for my 
office help, lodging, and so on. 
Synthesizing coinage would have 
been counterfeiting, which is 
against your laws, so I merely 
had a moderate amount of uncoined gold reposited, and I sell 
it on the regular Earth market as 
I need funds. Gold has no particular value on the Federated Planets, of course. I could get whatever you" need, so long as it isn't

enough to disrupt the economy 
any more than — well, than I have 
already. Let's limit ourselves to 
an amount that could be accounted for by an unusually good year 
in mining." 

"Sold!" Jerry said happily. "I 
think I can struggle along on a 
million a month retainer. Plus the 
usual fifteen per cent on advertising space and printing, of 
course; I'll have an estimate on 
that for you Tuesday. Since you 
can finance the whole campaign 
yourself, we'll leave the N.A.M. 
out of it. That way I can spare 
you the humiliation of signing an 
outright denial. All you have to 
do from now on is to keep mum. 
Don't even admit that you're the 
angel financing this campaign; 
that would make it look phony. 
I'll assign you three personal public-relations men. on twenty-fourhour shift. All your public remarks arc to screen through 
them." 

"But how can I conceal my 
identity when I'm sponsoring the 
campaign?" the Ambassador objected. 

"That's easy. The ostensible 
Sponsor will be a dummy organisation called — um — the Consumers Fact Finding Board. Nobody 
but me needs to know who signs 
the checks.** 

"How long will this campaign 
Continue?" 

"I figure it'll take about six 



months to sell the public this particular bill of goods. Once we get 
business revived, the best thing 
is never to mention- the words 
Matter Repositor again, not even 
to deny its existence. The ultimate 
goal is to make people forget they 
ever heard of such a gadget. The 
more convincing I make it, the 
quicker I'll work myself out of a 
job." 

"1 should think you'd make it 
last as long as possible: that's why 
I asked you for a time-limit. Do 
you want to work yourself out of 
a .job?" 

"You bet I do! Then T can start 
selling a bigger item, launch a 
longer-term promotion, one that 
will last till Earth gets civilized, 
till I don't have anything more to 
sell. From what you say. that will 
take a lot longer than I'll live." 

"It may be none of my business, but what is this big item 
you prooose to sell next?" the 
Ambassador asked, curiously. 

"Earth," Jerry said. 

The Ambassador looked confused. "I'm afraid I don't understand." 

"Didn't you just get through 
telling me. in effect, that any of 
your people who came to Earth 
could have all the money they 
wanted to spend? Well, I'm going 
to fun advertising copy on the 
Federated Planets, and get them 
to come here and spend it." 

"But I also told you taat ad



 



vertising is unknown on the Federated Planets!" the Ambassador 
protested. 

"All the better. Your people, 
then, will have less sales resistance than an audience of Earth 
kindergarten kids, who have had 
spot com mere i a Is din ned into 
their ears since birth. The only 
problem is space and time," 

"The Matter Repositor has effectively solved the problems of 
space and time." 

"No, I mean space and time as 
«n advertising man uses those 
terms. Newspaper and magazine 
space, radio and TV time. Do you 
have any newspapers out there?" 

"We have very little you would 
classify as news. No wars, no 
stock market, no crime, no epidemics, no political mudslinging, 
few accidents. But we do have information bulletins, of course." 

"Fine! Besides that million a 
month retainer, I want an exclusive contract to run advertising 
copy in the information bulletins 
on the Federated Planets." 

"This is completely unprecedented!" 

"You want to get out of this 
mess you're in, don't you? I'm the 
boy who can get you out, and 
that's my price." 

"You drive a hard bargain, Mr, 
Jergins. Very well, I'll arrange it. 
But I'm getting you the contract 
only because I'm certain your 
excursion idea won't work. Oh, I 



know Earthmen want to visit the 
Federated Planets ; I've had 
plenty of requests. I've had to 
explain repeatedly that we must 
hold to our announced policy of 
no ambassador from Earth, and 
no exchange students, until Earth 
has completed a few more steps 
in the development of her civilization. But surely none of our people will come to Earth, aside from 
a few students of comparative 
civilizations. Our general public 
can view samples of your national 
costumes, automobiles, and so on, 
in the museums. I can't see why 
they should want to come here, 
while Earth is still in a primitive 
and dangerous stage." 

"You can't, eh? Well, you 
might be surprised, Mr. Ambassador, you might be surprised. For 
the time being,. just picture yourself as the pilot of that B-29, 
grounded on a primitive little 
island in space. You've met a 
poor, ignora nt bushman. He 
couldn't reproduce your plane to 
save his neck. He can't manufacture a single gadget you'd want to 
buy. Nevertheless, you're about 
to see a demonstration of a few 
tricks of survival that your supercivilized race has forgotten — or, 
rather, never knew. I think you'll 
cook up into a right tasty dish."

Business Bureau of Oskaloosa, Iowa, nabbed a question

able character who had accepted 
deposits from local businessmen, 
in return for elaborately printed 
but worthless contracts to deliver 
Matter Repositors. 

The warning flash crossed similar warnings from New Orleans, 
Reno, Milwaukee, and the Borough of Queens, with a particularly hysterical note injected by Los 
Angeles, where the populace had 
proved most susceptible to the 
bogus agents. The news of a national ring of confidence artists, 
capitalizing on people's desire for 
Matter Repositors, ran in all 
papers, of course. The editors as 
yet hadn't the faintest idea that 
they were printing carefully engineered publicity. 

Before he even got his space 
contracts lined up. Jerry had accomplished quite a feat. He had 
fixed things so that, if the Ambassador from Outer Space himself had changed his mind, and 
imported a cargo of genuine Matter Repositors, he would have had 
some trouble convincing people 
he wasn't a crook. 

In a record two weeks, the campaign proper was ready to roll. 
It was long on white space, and 
the copy was so short that, after 
glancing at it a few times, you 
found that ypu had involuntarily 
committed it to memory. In the 
center of blank pages in all major 
metropolitan newspapers appeared a small want-ad, stating that 



the Consumers Fact Finding 
Board had deposited with a New 
York bank the sum of one million dollars in cash, alter taxes, 
which would be paid to any person, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, 
who could produce a Matter Repositor capable of repositing an 
object weighing two pounds a distance of ten feet. 

The offer was repeated daily 
for a month, and from the second 
day forward, there was a large, 
red overprint, looking like a 
crayon scrawl, which said, "No 
Takers to Date who Can Deliver 
the Goods!" 

The idea was pounded into the 
public mind by carcards, billboards, direct mail, and annoying telephone solicitors, who got 
subscribers out of bathtub and 
bed to ask them whether they had 
a Matter Repositor around the 
house they wanted to sell for a 
million dollars. Skywriters by day 
and illuminated blimps by night 
made sure the literate could not 
escape the message. Radio and 
TV singing and cartoon commercials took care of the illiterate. 

No conclusions were drawn in 
the copy. Each "prospect" was left 
with the comfortable feeling that 
his own superior intellect and 
powers of deduction had supplied 
the answer. No Matter Repositor 
turned up for sale, so everyone 
was sure there was no such thing. 
The whole campaign, like other 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



advertising campaigns before it, 
depended on what people failed 
to consider. They neglected to realise that a million dollars would 
be a joke to the owner of a Matter Repositor, who could reposit 
ell the wealth on Earth, including 
the million in the New York bank, 
but would have no use for money, 
since he could reposit usable 
goods. The magic phrase "a million dol 1 ars' ' wa s a world wid e 
symbol for a!l desirable material 
things. It would have been almost 
heresy to reflect that even that 
much cash had no actual value. 

A S Jerry prdmised. the Ambassador didn't have to issue 
an official denial. His chief pub 1 
lie relations man quite truthfully 
admitted to reporters that the 
Ambassador had no Matter Repositor in his possession, a dispatch carried by all wire services, 
and snickered at by clever columnists. 

In basements and garages, persons of good, bad, and indifferent 
mechanical ability strove to earn 
the million. The U.S. patent office 
was inundated with models and 
drawings of unworkable devices. 
One of the Duke University subjects tried to patent his ability to 
influence the fall of dice mentally. 

During the next session of the 
Congress, Jerry's crack lobbyists 
raised a great howl about the 
shameful congestion in the Patent 



Office, not mentioning, of course, 
that they were employed by the 
man who had created the congestion, by offering a million dollars for a device he knew no 
Earthman could build. 

Another dummy organization, 
dubbed the Inventors Protective 
League, sponsored a bill to amend 
the act relating to perpetual motion machines. It passed, with an 
emergency clause, and, thereafter, 
devices purporting to reposit matter were not entitled to letters of 
patent. 

This just about clinched the 
deal, for the vast majority of people, who had never watched laws 
enacted, assumed that if something was in the law, there must 
be a good reason for it, unless, of 
course, it was anything like prohibition. 

A name band revived "The 
Thing," leaving the drumbeats 
out of the vocal refrain, and substituting, "Get out of here with 
that. Matter Repositor, before I 
call a cop!" Within six months, 
radio and TV comedians had 
worn out the joke. Even Goofy, 
My Friend Irma, Mrs. Ace, and 
Gracie Allen were too sophisticated to believe in Matter Repository. Gags about tnem dropped 
to the same low level as those 
about Brooklyn and joke-stealing 
comics. 

Although his appearance in 
public was liable to start boos and 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



catcalls, the Ambassador from 
Outer Space was duly grateful. 
He was spared the painful necessity of reporting his disastrous 
slip of the tongue to his government, for Earth economy was 
again on the upward spiral. Everybody was spending the money 
he'd been saving up for a Matter 
Kepositor. 

The Ambassador cheerfully 
paid the million-a-month retainer 
and the whopping space bills, but 
Jerry's greatest gain in the transaction was his agreement allowing 
him to run advertising in the 
Federated Planets information 
bulletins. The space didn't cost 
him a nickel. Yet he knew how 
to sell his exclusive rights to it 
for more money than any one 
Earth company had in its promotional budget. 

By the time the campaign debunking the Matter Repositor 
was ready to die a natural death, 
Jerry had started an organization 
of Earth businessmen, spearheaded by the Restaurant and Hotel 
Associations, and the transportation interests, to promote Earth as 
a primitive planet. The primitive 
aspects of Earth, Jerry predicted, 
would exert a powerful appeal on 
the citizens of the Federated Planets, who must be pretty bored 
with civilization, and badly in 
need of a vaction from too 
much perfection. 

This organization was not com


posed of dummies, by any means, 
but the businessmen joined Up 
with a vague idea that their hostelries were to be way-stations, 
that they were going to promote 
sightseeing tours to places they 
themselves would call primitive, 
that the human exhibits would 
consist of blanketed Navajos, 
Chinese coolies, hula girls, Voodoo dancers, and Eskimos. 

Jerry filled the biggest convention hall in Chicago, and, at the 
climax of the proceedings, dramatically drew back a velvet curtain, unveiling a huge painting of 
the symbol of the campaign — a 
masked bandit, wearing a slouch 
hat, clutching in a greedy hand a 
fat bag marked with a dollar sign. 
Below was blazoned the tasteful 
slogan, "Let the People of Earth 
Gyp You!" 

A chorus of outrage echoed in 
the rafters. It hadn't occurred to' 
the members that primitive exhibit A would be themselves; to 
wit. the genus Earth businessman; 
sub - species, go - getter. Jerry 
emerged from the resulting argument somewhat battered, but with 
what any experienced advertising 
man would recognize as a victory. 
His copy was to run in five per 
cent of the space, keyed. Now all 
he had to do was prove in dollars 
and cents that he knew more 
about mass sales psychology than 
his clients, which was, of course, 
a cinch. 




) 



In spite of translation into a 
more civilized language, Jerry's 
five per cent of the space outpulled the tamer ninety-five per 
cent by better than ten to one. 
Thereafter, his clients swallowed 
their pride, voted him a free hand, 
and contented themselves with 
raking in the shekels from a 
steady stream of handsome and 
rich extraterrestrial tourists. 

A FTER Jerry's tourist promotion had been running two 
years, the U.S. Post Office broke 
down and printed an issue of 
three-cent stamps commemorating the influx, showing the goddess Terra with welcoming arms 
open to the starred heavens. Jerry 
Jergins, the second advertising 
man in history to achieve the distinction of having Uncle Sam plug 
his product on a stamp, thereby 
entered the most select circles of 
his chosen profession. 

Jerry bought enough of the 
stamps to paper the walls of his 
swank and spacious penthouse 
offices, for the benefit of the 
swarm ef tourists who invaded the 
place daily during afternoon 
open-house hours. They all wanted to see an advertising agency; 
to them, this phenomenon was 
the essence of that primitive planet, Earth. Jerry had recorded a 
lecture on primitive Earth customs which issued from concealed 
loudspeakers, and filled display 



cases with exhibits of primitive 
Earth culture, emphasizing the 
aspects he felt these extraterrestrials would find most exotic. 

Considering the fact that Jerry 
had managed to learn little about 
the Federated Planets that was 
not utterly essential to the mechanics of his advertising campaign there, he had done a pretty 
good job of "getting on the customer's side of the counter." Every tourist Jerry talked to had 
been conditioned, by some unrevealed but apparently foolproof 
process, not to repeat the Ambassador's error of mentioning 
Matter Repositors, or other aspects of life on the Federated 
Planets that might cause repercussions on Earth. Even tourist 
children couldn't be bribed with 
lollypops. Tourists talked a great 
deal, in fluent idiomatic Earth 
English, yet somehow said very 
little. 

But Jerry knew at least one 
thing — he was stirring emotions 
that lay so deep under layers and 
flayers of civilization that these 
shining, perfect people hadn't 
known they were capable of feeling them, until they visited Earth. 
He was getting under their 
smooth skins, just as surely as 
the monotone of a Haitian drumbeat gets under the skin of a New 
Yorker. 

One of the display cases contained the working tools ©f gang


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 





 



sterism — sawed-off shotguns, 
blackjacks, a model of a bulletproof automobile, a news photo of 
the St. Valentine's Day massacre, 
a clipping about police payoffs 
from houses of gambling and 
prostitution, another about blindness resulting from wood alcohol. 
The shot-glasses of authentic antique bootleg gin that stood on 
top the cases were often smelled 
but never sampled. 

The second case showed a chart 
of fluctuations of the stock market, with an actual operating 
ticker in the middle. Sections of 
the tape were much in demand as 
souvenirs. But the photo of a 
smashed body of a once-wealthy 
man who jumped from his office 
window after losing his fortune 
caused the most comment. The 
tourists found it difficult to understand how this man could 
consider his life less important 
than his bank balance. 

The largest case contained 
models of war weapons, a lurid, 
painting of Pearl Harbor under 
aerial attack, another of the Hiroshima mushroom that ushered in 
the atomic age. There were gas 
masks, artificial limbs, a photo of 
a blinded veteran led by a Seeing-Eye dog. The tourists gaped 
at that exhibit with all the relish 
of Coney Island crowds visiting 
wax replicas of famous murder 
scenes. 

And along the entire 40-foot 



wall of the reception room, a 
photo-mural of a ragged, depression-era breadline brooded over 
the sleek heads of the beautifully 
dressed and elaborately fed tourists. 

On his way back to the office 
after lunch one day. Jerry spied 
a traffic -stopping cluster of humanity in the street outside one 
of the city's leading department 
stores. The crowd was gathered 
around a paddy-wagon. Never 
diffident, Jerry elbowed his way 
through the crush, to see two 
handsome and once well-groomed 
gentlemen getting a, mussing up 
from a couple of cops. The suspects, athletic-looking characters, 
were putting up a good fight, and 
the policemen didn't 1 like it. As 
Jerry watched, a billy descended 
on a well-barbered head, and suspect number one ceased resisting 
arrest. 

Jerry had come into contact 
with enough extraterrestrials by 
now so that he knew a tourist 
When he saw one. The male tourists gave- him a violent pain in the 
neck, but he felt somewhat responsible. He grabbed an elbow 
of the suspect who remained conscious. 

"Give me your name, bud, and 
I'll bail you out. What happened?" 

"Oh, we just took a few things 
off the counters in that store," the 
tourist answered. "You're very 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



kind, but we have plenty of 
money for bail, thanks. Or is it a 
bribe you're supposed to hand 
them?" 

"If you have plenty of money, 
why in hell didn't you buy the 
stuff, instead of stealing it?" 

"We just thought we'd have a 
bit of a lark. New experience and 
all that. When on Earth, do as 
the Earthmen do." 

"A lark!" the biggest policeman 
grunted. "We'll give you a lark, 
all tight! Get in there, you!" He 
implemented his command with 
a well-placed kick in the seat of a 
pair of expertly tailored pants, 
boosting the tourist into the paddy-wagon, where his unconscious 
friend had already been deposited. 

The siren screamed, dispersing 
the crowd in front of the police 
vehicle, and Jerry went on his 
way, chuckling. As he passed a 
hole-in-the-wall bar he knew, he 
decided to stop for a quick one, 
to settle the heavy feeling in his 
stomach that came from eating 
lobster Newburg" for lunch. It 
wasn't a place where you'd care 
to take a lady, but they served an 
honest ounce. 

As Jerry pushed through the 
old-fashioned swinging doors, a 
burst of sound greeted him. A 
whiskey baritone was rendering 
one of the unpublishable versions 
of "Christopher Columbo," to the 
accompaniment of a piano tinkle 
by the hired help. The customer 




was obviously from the other side 
of the tracks — from the other side 
of the Galaxy, in fact — and he 
Was leaning against the piano for 
the simple reason that he couldn't 
stand up. 

He wore a well-cut Californiastyle dinner jacket, and after all 
night and half the day, the white 
gabardine was no longer white. 
Several drinks had been spilled 
on the midnight-blue flannel trousers. Only a magnificent physique 
distinguished him from the Earth 
or garden variety of drunk. 

Jerry stood up to the bar, and 
as his eyes became accustomed to 




 




the dimness, he observed a touching — literally — scene being enacted in the darkest booth. An 
Earthside racetrack tout, whom. 
Jerry recognized as one of the 
habitues of the place, had a gorgeous female tourist backed into 
a corner. She had retreated as far 
as the wall permitted, but he had 
long since caught up. 

Her jaunty, elbow -length chin


chilla cape lay on the wet table. 
Her exquisitely simple strapless 
dinner dress of silver lame exposed arms and shoulders that 
were literally out of this world. 
The naked effect was relieved 
only by a diamond, platinum, and 
emerald choker. Jerry knew, 
though the racetrack tout probably didn't, that the priceless 
bauble was Repositor - synthe


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



$1 



sized, with an Earth museum 
piece as a model. 

It was a tossup whether the race 
track tout was more interested in 
the diamonds or the tempting 
flesh they adorned. The girl made 
no attempt to fight him off. The 
reason for her acquiescence was 
not far to seek. The glass before 
her contained the remains of a 
"Pink Lady," which tastes like 
an ice-cream soda and kicks like 
four Kentucky mules. 

She moved her left hand to pick 
up the glass, and Jerry caught the 
flash of a circlet of channel-set 
baguette diamonds on the third 
finger. He concluded that she was 
the wife of the whiskey baritone. 
That worthy seemed utterly unconcerned about the whole thing, 
so why should Jerry interfere? 

The racetrack tout left his con- ■ 
quest momentarily, walked over 
to the bar, handed the bartender 
a five-spot. Without comment, the 
bartender took down a key tagged 
13 from a hook, and the turf expert pocketed it. There was a 
dingy sign reading "Hotel" outside; Jerry had always supposed 
the floors above contained equally 
dingy furnished rooms. 
/ ' The beautiful tourist's silver 
heels mounted the back stairs unsteadily. The tout was half steering her, half supporting her. The 
man was sober enough to know 
exactly what he was doing. When 
she came back down those stairs, 



she would be minus not only her 
virtue, but her diamond necklace 
as well. 

"Oh, he knew the world was 
round-o, that sailors could be 
found-o," the whiskey baritone 
sang lustily. 

Jerry left the saloon with a 
bad taste in his mouth. As he 
passed through the electric-eye 
doorway of his office suite, he had 
the impression that the too perfect inhabitants of all the color 
advertising pages he had turned 
out in past years had suddenly 
come to life. Handsome tourists 
were moving, in chattering groups, 
from one display case to another. 

Their chatter, as usual, gave 
him few clues. He still harbored 
a suspicion that on their home 
planets, these lovely people might 
be mbiotcs in the bodi es of 
lower animals, or loathsome but 
intellectual worms. But he never 
had any success when he tried to 
pump them about whether they 
were like Earth inhabitants at 
home, or were issued these magnificent bodies and faces along 
with their passports to Earth. 

His unreasoning dislike of the 
males was undoubtedly part jealousy, for they were all tall, handsome, well-dressed, and athletic 
enough to be signed en masse by 
Hollywood. But the universal 
utter perfection of limb, features, 
and complexion was not at all repulsive in the female. It was quite 




 



decorative to have a whole chorus 
of toothsome girls in Paris gowns 
cluttering up the orifice. 

Jerry had never seen one of 
them use a lipstick, rouge, or an 
eyebrow pencil. The cosmetic business was one of the few that had 
not profited from the tourist 
trade, except insofar as lady tourists bought costly perfumes, and 
Earth girls strove to mimic the 
natural — or unnatural — coloring 
of the fair visitors. A few tourists 
brought their children along, and 
here the firm, rosy, unblemished 
skin was in its proper element. 
Tourist children were not one 
whit more cherubic than wellfavored chitdren of Earth. 

A guide from the Conducted 
Tours Company arrived to r,pund 
up a batch of tourists, for a visit 
to the local jails, flop-houses, and 
gambling dens. He announced 
they would go by bus, and the 
horrified yet delighted whoops 
that greeted this news reminded 
Jerry of a Boston society dowager 
who had just been invited to ride 
on a camel. 

As the crowd trickled out the 
doors, a lovely vision in platinum 
blonde laid a slender hand on 
Jerry's arm. 

"Are you realty the man who 
"first thought of inviting us to this 
quaint and delightful planet?" 
she gushed. 

"I guess I am, lady. How do 
you like it?" 



/'Oh. it's so primitive? So elemental! Everybody used to think 
visiting backward planets was 
dull and scholarly stuff. It took 
you to show us how thrilling and 
exciting it can be!" 

"I'm glad to hear you say that. 
Some of the tourists are complaining that Earth isn't as primitive as the Tourist Bureau advertising makes it out to be." 

"Oh, you do exaggerate a wee, 
tiny bit, but it's all in good fun, 
isn't it? On the whole, I'm not 
disappointed — especially not in 
the men!" She fluttered eyelashes, 
so long and dark that they looked 
artificial, at him. 

"The men?" Jerry asked blank
ly
"Oh, come, come!" the platinum blonde breathed throatily 
into his ear. "Don't pretend to be 
so innocent! You must have heard 
of the - simply terrific reputation 
Earthmen have acquired on other 
planets as masterful lovers!" 

"It's news to' me," Jerry admitted, "but it sounds like a good 
drawing card. I'M try to work 
something like that into our ads." 

"Always thinking about business, aren't you? Why don't you 
think of something else, for a 
change? Me, for instance. Don't 
you feel a little bit sorry for a 
girl like me, with nothing but perfectly civilized men to go home 
to?" the girl pouted invitingly. 

Jerry found himself, by imper


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



93 



ceptible stages, being backed into 
a corner. Well, well, he thought. 
Perhaps he'd been too harsh in 
judging that racetrack tout. 

"Since you mention it," Jerry 
said, "I'm not averse to playing 
the role of Galactic beachboy." 

"What does a beachboy do?'* 

44 I'd blush to explain it verbally 
to a girl unaccustomed to primitive Earth customs, but I'm 
pretty good at sign language. How 
about dinner tonight?" 

"Well ... if you'll let me pay 
the check. I do so adore this 
amazing Earth custom of exchanging food for little slips of 
paper." 

"The pleasure is all yours, sister. See you at the Ritz main dining room — eight o'clock. Soup 
and fish. Afterward, we'll look at 
my photo-murals. Now toddle 
along, baby, if you want to catch 
the bus to see those hoboes.** 

Jerry was walking on the Milky 
Way. Aside from the profits, this 
job had its esthetic side, he decided. His exuberance was slightly dampened by the grim expression on his secretary's face. 

"A very important man has 
been waiting to see you," she said 
disapprovingly. "I sent him into 
your office. The least I could do 
was put him where he wouldn't 
have to smell all the perfume 
these brazen tourist women use. 
It's enough to make a person ill!" 

In the visitor's chair before 



Jerry's mother - of - pearl inlaid 
desk, the Ambassador from Outer 
Space was waiting, staring morosely at the endlessly repeated 
welcoming goddess Terra on 
Jerry's wall stamp collection. 

"Well, as I live and breathe!" 
Jerry exclaimed, "a real, live B-29 
pilot! Welcome to my humble 
grass shack! Scotch? Cigar? What 
can I do for you?" 

"You can put out your bonfire, 
cannibal," the Ambassador said, 
gruffly. "I think I've stewed 
enough." 

"Why are you tough, then?" 
Jerry asked. "At me, I mean. I 
thought I was your best friend in 
this here jungle. Didn't I do you 
a favor once, Mr. Ambassador?" 

"A favor? I paid you well for 
it! Not only in money, but by getting advertising space for your 
precious Tourist Bureau on the 
Federated Planets. I never 
thought it would lead to this!" 

"You thought my copy wouldn't pull, eh? Not even after I'd 
demonstrated I could make Earth 
opinion do a flip -flop on that 
Matter Repositor deal?" 

"Oh, I was quite sure you could 
, manipulate Earthmen. Thajt's 
your job. But I didn't believe our 
people would respond in such 
numbers to an appeal to primitive emotions!" 

"You weren't alone in that,'* 
Jerry said smugly. "Some very 
prominent members of our or


CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ganization wanted to make the 
campaign more civilized. I showed them where they were wrong. 
Can't you see that your people 
are fed up with civilization, right 
up to their pretty white necks? 
The very essence of Earth's appeal to them is that a trip here 
gives them a chance to relax their 
ethics, to play at going native." 

"Don't rub it in!" The Ambassador shuddered. 

"It's nothing new. Tourists 
have always kicked up their 
heels. Guess what 1 saw while 
I was out to lunch. The cops 
grabbed a couple of your boys 
for shoplifting! They thought it 
was such fun to ride in the paddywagon. Back home, of course, 
they wouldn't think of repositing 
anything they weren't supposed 
to. but on Earth it's different." 

"And for fn oh key shines like 
that," the Ambassador growled, 
"I am driven half crazy working 
out sleep-record courses. 'Idioms 
of Earth English*— 'What Not to 
Say on Backward Planets and 
Why" — 'Earth Fashion Guide, 
What You Can Buy There and 
What to Reposit.' Bah! I'm supposed to be a diplomat, not a 
■fashion adviser!" 
' "Why don't you hire s6me 
help?" "Jerry suggested. 

"I have. I've hired a whole 
staff, with offices in all major 
Earth cities, to exchange platinum, bullion, and precious: stones 



for Earth currencies. It's a mansized job, I can tell you, to keep 
Earth currencies stable under this 
load!" 

"You're doing a very good 
job," Jerry said, soothingly. 

"You know what one of our 
citizens asked me yesterday? How 
she could get a marriage licensef 
Your officials had turned her 
down, because she'd been conditioned not to mention her birthplace and age. Mind you, a citizen of the Federated Planets 
wanted to marry an Earthman 
and live on this raw, Galactic 
frontier the rest of her life! Why, 
we don't even know whether the 
races can cross-breed!" 

"That should be looked into* 
Jerry agreed. 

"What are you trying to do?** 
the Ambassador demanded. 
"Drag the citizens of the Federated Planets down to the level 
of your jungle? YoU blithely assume those two shoplifters can 
be trusted with Matter Repositors 
when they get back home, but 
I'm not so sure. We haven't any 
jails to toss them into, but wc 
may have to establish some. Matter-Repositor-proof jails!" 

"That's your problem," Jerry 
said. "AH I'm trying to do is 
make some money for myself and 
other businessmen on Earth. 
Which I'm doing, thank you. And 
I doubt that you could stop me, 
at this point. Your citizens would 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



raise quite a howl if my ads stopped appearing in the information 
bulletins." 

"Money!" the Ambassador exclaimed, "All you Earthmen think 
about is money!" He leaned over 
Jerry's desk. "What if you could 
reposit the money — the gold, that 
is — without all the work you have 
to put into entertaining these 
tourists?" 

"Hmm," Jerry said, thinking of 
his date for that evening, and 
other equally lovely tourists. 
"Money isn't the only thing i 
life. And don't forget the income 
tax. I've got to have some deductible expenses." 

"Knowing you, I'd bet you 
.could figure out some way of handling that little detail." 

"What's your proposition?" 

"Two years ago, you came to 
my office, wanting to import Matter Repositors. I told you Earth's 
civilization wasn't ready for 
them." 

"We still aren't, according to 
what you say about our avaricious instincts." 

"No, you're not. But you have 
methods of manipulating public 
opinion and attitudes that arc far 
more advanced than those found 
on other planets." 

"So you admit that Earth is 
advanced in something!" Jerry 
said happily. 

"How would you like to have 
the name of Jerry Jergins go down 



in your history as the originator 
of the most significant publicrelations campaign ever undertaken on this planet?" the Ambassador asked, temptingly. "You 
can handle it, if any man on 
Earth can." 

"Softsoaping me again! What's 
the campaign? I'll listen to it, but 
I don't know whether I'll buy it" 
"Your job would be to get 
Earth's psychology and sociology 
ready for the Matter Repositor." 

Jerry reflected. "You mean I'd 
have to eliminate war, supplement the Voice of America, and 
so on? I'd have certain advantages over the Voice of America, 
at that. I wouldn't have a bunch 
of politicians playing football 
with my appropriations." 

"This campaign would have to 
go further and deeper than the 
Voice of America. You might call 
it the Voice of Conscience. Its aim 
would be to make every human 
being on Earth care more about 
the welfare of his fellow-man than 
he cares about his own." 

"A couple of thousand years 
back," Jerry said, soberly, "a better Promoter than I tried to put 
that idea across. The campaign 
He started is still running. It's 
taken hold in some quarters, but 
I wouldn't say public acceptance 
is anything like worldwide yet." 

"Then you don't think you can 
do it?" the Ambassador asked, hia 
eagerness somewhat deflated. 



H 




 



"I'm not committing myself to 
whether I could or couldn't. I 
could put the Ten Commandments on an international hookup. 
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt 
not covet thy neighbor his goods. 
I could get Walt Disney to dramatize the golden rule.*' 

"Ah, I see you have some ideas 
for the copy already," the Ambassador said. "I thought I could 
get you interested in it. Then 
you'll sign a contract?" 

"No," Jerry said, briefly and 
definitely. 

"Now, wait a minute, Mr. Jergins," the Ambassador protested. 
"Why do you suddenly become 
blunt and unqualified? Do you 
realize what I'm offering you? In 
return for ceasing this tourist promotion, I'm offering you the invention that obsolesces all others 
■ — the Matter Repositor!" 

Jerry stood up and placed the 
palms of his hands flat on his 
desk. "I told you that you'd learn 
something in our primitive jungle, 
Mr. Ambassador. Well, this is it. 
We may be mechanical morons, 
according to your standards, but 
we naked savages can produce 
anything we need. Since we've 
corrected the misconception that 
what Earth produces isn't good 
enough for Earthmen, and whipped up a tourist trade, business 
is booming. And when it booms, 
we can distribute those Earth 
products in a way that suits us 



pretty well. A primitive way, you 
may think, but one that is 
adapted to the unfortunate circumstance that we aren't a bunch 
of little tin saints living in an 
ideal world. 

"I asked you for Matter Repositors once, and you were wise 
enough to turn me down. I'm glad 
you did. They'd cause us more 
trouble than {he atomic bomb. 
We don't want the damn things. 
Do you understand that?" 

On sudden impulse, Jerry 
strode across his office. There 
stood a large and brilliantly colored object, jarring oddly with 
the other furniture. Sometimes at 
a toss to spend his newly acquired 
wealth, Jerry had yielded, a 
month or so before, to a desire 
conceived in childhood to own a 
real honest-to-goodness juke box. 

Jerry fished in his pocket for a 
nickel, deposited it in the slot, 
pushed button seven. Loud, tinny, 
and offensively blatant, the 
strains of "I Don't Wanna Leave 
the Congo" filled the office, effectively drowning out any further remarks the Ambassador 
from Outer Space might have 
wished to make. 

"If you'll pardon me," Jerry 
shouted over the din, "I have 
some arrow heads to chip — and a 
potential extraterrestrial mate to 
woo with a quaint tribal ritual we 
call dating on Earth."
