Templin tightened his 
safety belt and lay back on the 
acceleration bunk. The lights in 
the cabin dimmed to a .dull, red 
glow that meant the time for 



takeoff was ncaring. He could 
hear noises from deep within the 
ship and the tfny whir of the ventilator fan, filling the air with the 
sweetish smell of sleeping gas. 
To sleep the trip away was better 
than to face the dull monotony

of the stars for days on end. 

Oh, they kill themselves for lots 
of reasons. Maybe ill health or 
Hnantial messes or family difficulties. An unhapy love affair. Or 
more complex ones, ii you went 
into it deeper. The failure to 
achieve ait ambition, failure to 
live up to one's own ideals. Weltschmerz, perhaps. 

He could smell the bitter fragrance of tobacco smoke mingling 
with the gas. Eckert had lit a 
cigarette and was calmly blowing 
the smoke at the neon "No Smoking" sign, which winked on and 
off in mechanical disapproval. 

He turned his head slightly so 
he could just see Eckert in the 
bank facing him. Eckert, one of 
the good gray men in the Service. 
The old reliables, the ones who 
could take almost anything in 
their stride because, at one time 
or another, they had had to. 

It was Eckert who had come 
into his office several days ago 
and told him that Don Pendleton 
had killed himself. 

Only Pendleton wasn't the type. 
He was the kind who have everything to live for, the kind you instinctively know will amount to 
something someday. And that was 
a lousy way to remember him. 
The cliches always come first. 
Your memory plays traitor and 
hoils friendship down to the status 
of a breakfast food testimonial. 
The soft red lights seemed to 



be dancing in the darkness of the 
cabin. Eckert was j ust a dull, 
formless blur opposite him. His 
cigarette was out. 

Eckert had come into his office 
without saying a word and had 
watched his scenery-window. It 
had been snowing in the window, 
the white flakes making a simple 
pattern drifting past the glass. 
Eckert had fiddled with the controls and changed it to sunshine, 
then to a weird mixture of hail 
amid the brassy, golden sunlight. 

And then Eckert had told him 
that Pendleton had taken the 
short way out. 

He shouldn't get sentimental. 
But how the hell else should he 
remember Pendleton? Try to forget it and drink a toast to him at 
the nex/ class reunion? And never, 
never be so crude as to speculate 
why Pendleton should have done 
it? If, of course, he had . . . 

The cabin was hazy in the reddish glow, the sleeping gas a 
heavy perfume. 

Eckert and he had talked it out 
and gone over the records. Pendleton had come of good stock. 
There had been no mental instaJ bility in his family for as far back 
as the genetic records went. He 
had been raised in a middle-class 
neighborhood and attended a 
local grammar school where he 
had achieved average grades and 
had given his instructors the normal amount of trouble. Later,

when he had made up his mind to 
enter the Diplomatic Service, his 
grades had improved. He had 
worked hard at it, though he 
wasn't what you would call a 
grind. In high school and later in 
college, he was the well-balanced 
type, athletic, popular, hardworking. 

How long would it be before 
memories faded and all there tvas 
left of Pendleton was a page of 
statistics? He had been on this 
team, he had been elected president of that, he had graduated 
with such and such honors. But 
try getting a picture of him by 
reading the records, resurrect him 
from a page of black print. Would 
he be human? Would he be flesh 
and blood? Hell, no! In the statistics Pendleton was the AilAround Boy, the cold marble 
statue with the finely chiseled 
muscles and the smooth, blank 
sockets where the eyes should be. 
Maybe someday fate would play 
a trick on a hero-worshiping public and there would actually be 
kids like that. But they wouldn't 
be human; they wouldn't be born. 
Parents would get them by sending in so many box tops. 

He was drowsy; the room was 
filled with the gas now. It would 
be only a matter of minutes before he would be asleep. 

Pendleton had been in his second year as attache on Tunpesh. 
a small planet with a G-type sun. 



The Service had stumbled across 
it recently and decided the system 
was worth diplomatic recognition 
of some kind, so Pendleton had 
been sent there. He had been the 
first attache to be sent and naturally he had gone alone. 

There was no need to send 
more. Tunpesh had [ been inspected and certified and approved. The natives were primitive and friendly. Or maybe the 
Service had slipped up, as it 
sometimes did, and Tunpesh had 
received something less than a 
thorough survey. 

And then an unscheduled 
freighter had put in for repairs, 
one of the very few ships that 
ever came by Tunpesh. The captain had tried to pay his respects 
to Pendleton. Only Pendleton 
wasn't there. The natives said he 
had killed himself and showed 
the captain the little flower-covered plot where they had buried 
him. 

Tunpesh had been Pendleton's 
second assignment. 

The natives were oh-so-friendly. So friendly that he had made 
sure that a certain box was on 
board, filled with shiny atomic 
rifles, needle pistols, and the fat 
little gas guns. They might be 
needed. People like Pendleton 
didn't kill themselves, did they? 
No, they didn't. But sometimes 
they were murdered. 

It was almost black inside the 



THE FIRE AND THE SWOIV 



US 



cabin now; only a thin red line 
around the ceiling told how close 
they were to takeoff. His head 
was thick with drowsiness, his 
eyelids a heavy weight that he 
knew he couldn't keep open much 
longer. 

Eckert and he had been chosen 
to go to Tunpesh and investigate. 
The two of them, working together, should be able to find out 
Why Pendleton had killed himself. 

But that wasn't the real reason. 
Maybe Eckert thought so, but he 
knew better. The real reason they 
were going there was to find out 
why Pendleton had been killed 
and who had killed him. That 
was it. 

Who had killed Cock Robin? 

The thin red line was practically microscopic now and Templin could feel his lashes lying 
gently on his cheeks. But he 
wasn't asleep — not quite. There 
was something buzzing about hi 
the dim recesses of his mind. 

Their information on Tunpesh 
was limited. They knew that it 
had no trading concessions or 
armed forces and that nobody 
from neighboring systems seemed 
to know much about it or even 
visited it. But a staff anthropologist must have been routinely assigned to Tunpesh to furnish data 
and reports. 

"Ted?" he murmured sleepily. 

A faint stirring in the black 
bulk opposite him. "Yes?" 

126 



"How come our anthropologist 
on Tunpesh didn't come across 
with more information?" 

A drowsy mumble from the 
other cot: "He wasn't there long 
enough. He committed suicide not 
long after landing." 

The room was a whirling pool 
of blackness into which his mind 
was slowly slipping. Takeoff was 
only seconds away. 

Why do people commit suicide? 

"TT'S a nice day, isn't it, Ted?" 

-*- Eckert took a deep and 
pleasurable breath. "It's the type 
of day that makes you feel good 
just to be alive." 

Warm breezes rustled through 
Eckert's graying hair and tugged 
gently at his tunic. The air smelted as if it had been washed and 
faintly perfumed with the balrsamy scent of something very 
much like pine. A few hundred 
yards away, a forest towered 
straight and slim and coolly inviting, and brilliantly colored 
birds whirled and fluttered in the 
foliage. 

The rocketport, where they 
were standing surrounded by their 
luggage, was a grassy valley 
where the all too infrequent ships 
could land and discharge cargo 
or make repairs. There was a 
blackened patch on it now, with 
little blast-ignited flames dying 
out around the edges. It won't bo 
long before it will be green again, 

lALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he thought. The grass looked as 
though it grew fast — it would certainly have plenty of time to grow 
before the next ship landed. 

He looked at the slim, dwindling shape that was the rocket, 
and was suddenly, acutely aware 
that he and Templin would be 
stranded for six months on a foreign and very possibly dangerous 
planet. And there would be no 
way of calling for help or of 
leaving before the six months were 
up. 

He stood there for a moment, . 
drinking in the fresh air and 
feeling the warmth of the sun 
against his face. It might be a 
pleasant six months at that, away 
from the din and the hustle and 
confusion, spending the time in a 
place where the sun was warm 
and inviting. 

/ must be getting old, he 
thought, thinking about the 
warmth and comfort. Like old 
dogs and octogenarians. * 

Templin was looking at the 
scenery with a disappointed expression on his face. Eckert stole 
a side glance at him and for a 
fleeting moment felt vaguely concerned. "Don't be disappointed if 
it doesn't look like cloak-anddagger right off, Ray. What stems 
innocent enough on the surface 
can prove to be quite dangerous 
underneath." 

"It's rather hard to think of 
danger in a setting like this." 



Eckert nodded agreement. "It 
wouldn't fit, would it? It would 
be like a famous singer suddenly 
doing a jazz number in an opera, 
or having the princess in a fairy 
tale turn out to be ugly." He gestured toward the village. "You 
could hardly class that as dangerous from its outward appearance, could you?" 

The rocketport was in a small 
valley, surrounded by tow, wooded hills. The village started where 
the port left off and crawled and 
wound over the wooded ridges. 
Small houses of sun-baked, whitewashed mud crouched in the 
shadow of huge trees and hugged 
the banks of a small stream. 

It looked fairly primitive, Eckert thought, and yet it didn't have 
the earmarks, the characteristics 
of most primitive villages. It 
didn't seem cluttered or dirty and 
you didn't feel like beating a 
hasty retreat when the wind was 
blowing toward you. 

A few adults were watching 
them curiously and the usual 
bunch of kids*that always congregated around rocketports 
quickly gathered. Eckert stared at 
them for a moment, wondering 
what it was that seemed odd 
about them, and they stared back 
with all the alert dignity of childhood. They finally came out on 
the field and clustered around 
him and Templin. 

Templin studied them warily. 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



127 



"Better watch them, Ted. Even 
kids can be dangerous." 

It's because you never suspect 
ttids, Eckert thought, you never 
think they'll do any harm. But 
they can be taught. They could 
do as much damage with a knife 
as a man could, for instance. And 
they might have other weapons. 

But the idea still didn't go with 
the warm sun and the blue sky 
and the piny scent of the trees. 

One of the adults of the village 
started to walk toward them. 

"The reception committee," 
Templin said tightly. His hand 
went inside his tunic. 

He couldn't be blamed for being jumpy, Eckert realized. This 
was his Brst time out, his first 
mission like this. And, of course, 
Pendleton had been a pretty good 
friend of his. 

"I'd be very careful what I 
did," Eckert said softly. "I would 
hate to start something merely 
because I misunderstood their intentions." 

The committee of one was a 
middle-aged man -dressed in a 
simple strip of white cloth twisted 
about his waist and allowed to 
hong freely to his knees. When he 
got closer, Eckert became less 
sure of his age. He had the firm, 
tanned musculature of a much 
younger man, though a slightly 
seamed face and white hair aged 
him somewhat. Eckert still had 
the feeling that if you wanted to 



know his exact age, you'd have 
to look at his teVth or know something about his epiphyseal closures. 

"You are menshars from 
Earth?" The voice was husky and 
pleasant and the pronunciation 
was very clear. Eckert regarded 
him thoughtfully and made a few 
mental notes. He wasn't bowing 
and scraping like most natives 
who weren't too familiar with visitors from the sky, and yet he was 
hardly either friendly or hostile. 

"You learned our language 
from Pendleton and Reynolds?" 
Reynolds had been the anthropologist. 

"We have had visitors from 
Earth before." He hesitated a moment and then offered his hand, 
somewhat shyly, Eckert thought, 
in the Terrestrial sign of greeting. "You may call me Jathong 
if you wish." He paused a moment to say something in his 
native^ tongue to the kids who 
were around. They promptly scattered and picked up the luggage. 
"While you are here, you will 
need a place to stay. There is one 
ready, if you will follow me." 

'He was polite, Eckert thought. 
He didn't ask what they were 
there for or how long they were 
going to stay. But then again, 
perhaps the natives were a better 
judge of that than he and Templin. 

The town was larger than he 



J28 



GAIAX-K SCIENCE FICTION 



had thought at first, stretching 
over a wide expanse of the countryside. There wasn't, so far as he 
could see, much manufacturing 
above the level of handicrafts and 
simple weaving. Colored patches 
on far hillsides indicated the presence of farms, and practically 
every house in the village had its 
small garden. 

What manufacturing there was 
seemed to be carried on in the 
central square of the town, where 
a few adults and children squatted in the warm afternoon sun 
and worked industriously at potter's wheels and weaver's looms. 
The other part of the square was 
given over to the native bazaar 
where pots and bolts of cloth were 
for sale, and where numerous 
stalls were loaded with dried 
fruits and vegetables and the 
cleaned and plucked carcasses of 
the local variety of fowl. 

It was late afternoon when they 
followed Jathong into a small, 
white-washed house midway up a 
hill. 

"You are free to use this while 
you are here," he said. 

Eckert and Templin took a 
quick tour of the few rooms. They 
were well furnished, in a rustic 
sort of way, and what modern 
conveniences they didn't have 
they could easily do without. The 
youngsters who had carried their 
luggage left it outside and quietly 
faded away. It was getting dark; 



Eckert opened one of the boxes 
they had brought along, took out 
an electric lantern and lighted it. 
He turned to Jathong. 

"You've been very kind to us 
and we would like to repay you. 
You may take what you wish of 
anything within this box." He 
opened another of the boxes and 
displayed the usual trade goods— 
brightly colored cloth and finely 
worked jewelry and a few mechanical contrivances that Eckert 
knew usually appealed to the 
primitive imagination. 

Jathong ran his hand over the 
cloth and held some of the jewelry up to the light. Eckert knew 
by the way he looked at it that 
he wasn't at all impressed. "I am 
grateful," he said finally, "but 
there is nothing I want." He 
turned and walked away into the 
gathering darkness. 

"The incorruptible native." 
Templin laughed sarcastically. 

Eckert shrugged. "That's one 
of the things you do out of habit, 
try and buy some of the natives 
so you'll have friends in case you 
need them." He stopped for a moment, thinking. "Did you notice 
the context? He didn't say he 
didn't want what we showed him. 
He said there was nothing that he 
wanted. Implying that everything 
he wanted, he already had." 

"That's not very typical of a 
primitive society, is it?" 

"No, I'm afraid it's not." Eck


THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



I2» 



ert started unpacking some of the 
boxes. "You know, Ray, I got a 
kick out of the kids. They're a 
healthy-looking lot, aren't they?" 

"Too healthy," Templin said. 
"There didn't seem to be any sick 
ones or ones with runny noses or 
cuts or black eyes or bruises. It 
doesn't seem natural." 

"They're probably just well 
brought-up kids," Eckert said 
sharply. "Maybe they've been 
taught not to get in fights or play 
around in the mud on the way 
home from school." He felt faintly 
irritated, annoyed af. the way 
Templin had put it, as if any deviation from an Earth norm was 
potentially dangerous. 

"Ted." Templin 's voice was 
strained. "This could be a trap, 
you know," 

"In what way?" 
The words came out slowly. 
"The people are too casual, as 
though they're playing a rehearsed part. Here we are, from 
an entirely different solar system, 
landed in what must be to them 
an unusual manner. They couldn't 
have seen rockets more than three 
or four times before. It should 
still be a novelty to them. And 
yet how much curiosity did they 
show? Hardly any. Was there any 
fear? No. And the cute, harmless 
little kids." He looked at Eckert. 
"Maybe that's what we're supposed to think — just an idyllic, 
harmless society. Maybe that's 



what Pendleton thought, right to 
the very end." 

He was keyed up, jumpy, Eckert realized. He would probably 
be seeing things in every shadow 
and imagining danger to be lurking around every corner. 

"It hasn't been established yet 
that Pendleton was killed, Ray. 
Let's keep an open mind until we 
know for certain." 

He nicked out the light and lay 
back on the cool bed, letting his 
body relax completely. The cool 
night wind blew lazily through 
the wood slat blinds, carrying the 
fragrance of the trees and the 
grass, and he inhaled deeply and 
let his thoughts wander for a moment. It was going to be pleasant 
to live on Tunpesh for six months 
— even if the six months were all 
they had to live. The climate was 
superb and the people seemed a 
cut above the usual primitive culture. If he ever retired some day, 
he thought suddenly, he would 
have to remember Tunpesh. It 
would be pleasant to spend his 
old age here. And the fishing was 
probably excellent . . . 

He turned his head a little to 
watch Templin get ready for bed. 
There were advantages in taking 
him along that Templin probably 
didn't even realize. He wondered 
what Templin would do if he ever 
found out that the actual reason 
he had been chosen to go was that 
his own psychological chart was 



130 




 



vey close to Pendleton's. Pendleton's own feelings and emotions 
would almost exactly be duplicated in Templin's. 

A few stray wisps of starlight 
pierced through the blinds and 
sparkled for an instant on a small 
metal box strapped to Templin's 
waist. A power pack, Eckert saw 
grimly, probably leading to the 
buttons on his tunic. A very convenient, portable, and hard to detect weapon. 

There were disadvantages in 
taking Templin, too. 




UST how primitive do you 
think the society is, Ted?" 



Eckert put down the chain he 
had been whittling and reached 
for his pipe and tobacco. 

"I don't think it's primitive at 
all. There are too many disparities. Their knowledge of a lot of 
things is a little more than empirical knowledge; they associate 
the growth of crops with fertilizer 
and nitrogen in the soil as well as 
sunlight, rather than the blessings 
of some native god. And they differ a lot in other respects. Their 
art and their music are advanced. 
Free art exists along with purely 
decorative art, and their techniques are finely developed." 

"I'm glad you agree, then. Take 
a look at this." Templin threw 
a shiny bit of metal on the roughhewn table. Eckert picked it up 
and inspected it. It was heavy and 



one side of it was extremely 
sharp. 

"What's it for?" 

"They've got a hospital set up 
here. Not a hospital like any we 
know, of course, but a hospital 
nonetheless. It's not used very 
much; apparently the natives 
don't get sick here. But occasionally there are hunting accidents 
and injuries that require surgery. 
The strip of metal there is a scalpel." He laughed shortly. "Primitive little gadget, but it works well 
— as well as any of ours." 

Eckert hefted it in his palm. 
"The most important tiling is that 
they have the knowledge to use 
it. Surgery isn't a simple science." 

"Well, what do you think about 
it?" 

"The obvious. They evidently 
have as much technology as they 
want, at least in fields where they 
have to have it." 

"How come they haven't gone 
any further?" 

"Why should they? You can 
live without sky cars and rocket 
ships, you know." 

"Did you ever wonder what 
kind of weapons they might 
have?" 

"The important thing." Eckert 
mused, "is not if they have them, 
but if they'd use them. And I 
rather doubt that they would. 
We've been here for two weeks 
now and they've been very kind 
to us, seeing that we've had food 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



13t 



end water and what fuel we 
need." 

"It's known in the livestock 
trade as being fattened up for the 
slaughter," Templeton said. 

Eckert sighed and watched a 
fat bug waddle across a small 
patch of sunlight on the wooden 
floor. It was bad enough drawing 
an assignment in a totally foreign 
culture, even if the natives were 
humanoid. It complicated things 
beyond all measure when your 
partner in the project seemed 
likely to turn into a vendettist. 
It meant that Eckert would have 
to split his energies. He'd have to 
do what investigating he could 
among the Tunpeshans, and he'd 
have to watch Templin to see that 
he didn't go off half-cocked and 
spoil everything. 

"You're convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren't you?" 

Templin nodded. "Sure." 

"Why?" 

"The Tunpeshans know why 
we're here. We've dropped enough 
hints along those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; 
nobody has volunteered any information about him. And he was 
an attache here for three years. 
Didn't anybody know him during 
that time? We've let slip a few 
discreet statements that we would 
like to talk to Pendleton's friends, 
yet nobody's come around. Apparently, in all the three years he 
was here, Pendleton didn't make 



any friends. And that's a little 
hard to believe. It's more likely 
that his friends have been silenced and any information about 
him is being withheld for a reason." 

"What reason?" 

Templin shrugged. "Murder. 
What other reason could there 
be?" 

Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the 
scenery. A hundred feet down the 
road, a native woman was going 
to market, leading a species of 
food animal by the halter. 

"They grow their women nice, 
don't they?" 

"Physically perfect, like the 
men," Templin grumbled. "You 
could get an inferiority complex 
just from watching the people 
here. Everybody's so damn perfect. Nobody's sick, nobody's unhealthy, nobody is too fat or too 
thin, nobody's unhappy. The only 
variation is that they don't all 
look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while." 

"Does it? I hadn't noticed." 
Eckert turned away from the 
blinds. His voice was crisp. "I 
knew Don Pendleton quite well, 
too," he said. "But it isn't blinding me to what I'm here for. We 
came to find out what happened 
to him, not to substantiate any 
preconceived notions. What we 
find out may be vitally important 
to anybody serving here in the 



132 




 



future. T would hate to see our 
efforts spoiled because you've already made up your mind." 

"You knew Pendleton," Templin repeated grimly. "Do you 
think it was suicide?" 

"1 don't think there's such a 
thing as a suicide type, when you 
come down to it. I'm not ruling 
out the possibility of murder, 
either. I'm trying to keep an open 
mind." 

"What have we accomplished 
so far? What have we found out?" 

"We've got six months." Eckert 
said quietly. "Six months in which 
we'll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and 
try to cultivate informants. We 
would get nowhere if we came 
barging in asking all sorts of questions. And don't forget, Ray, 
we're all alone on Tuhpesh. If it 
is a case of murder, what happens 
when the natives Find out that we 
know it is?" 

Templin's eyes dueled for a 
moment. Then he turned his back 
and Valked to the window. "I 
suppose you're right," he said at 
last. "It's nice living here, Ted. 
Maybe I've been fighting it. But 
I can't help thinking that Don 
must have liked it here, too." 

f~VNE of the hardest things to 
learn in a foreign culture, 
Eckert thought, is when to enjoy 
yourself, when to work and when, 
to worry. 



"Pelache, menshar?** 

"Sharra!" He took the small 
bowl of pelache nuts, helped himself to a few, and passed the bowl 
on. This was definitely the time 
to enjoy himself, not to work or 
worry. He had heard about the 
halera a few days ago, and, by 
judicious hinting to the proper 
authorities, he and Templin had 
been invited. It was a good chance 
to observe native customs. A little 
anthropology — with refreshments. 

The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous helpings of the roasted 
ulami and the broiled halunch 
and numerous dabs from the side 
dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course, they passed 

around a small flagon of the hot, 
spiced native wine, but he noticed 
that nobody drank to excess. 

The old Greek ideal, he 
thought : moderation in every* 
thing. 

He looked at Templin, sitting 
across from him in the huge circle, 
and shrugged mentally. Templin, 
looked as if he was about to break 
down and enjoy himself, but there 
was still a slight bulge under his 
tunic, where he had strapped hi$ 
power pack. Any fool should have 
known that nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The 
only actual danger lay in Templin's getting excited and doing 
something he was bound to regret 
later on. And even that danger 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



was not quite as likely now. 

There will be hell to pay, Eckert thought, if Templin ever finds 
out that I sabotaged his power 
pack. 

"You look thoughtful, menshar 
Eckert." 

Eckert took another sip of the 
wine and turned to the Tunpeshan 
on his left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm 
chin and a certain aura of author rty. 

"I was wondering if my coun. tryman Pendleton had offended 
your people in any way, Nayova." 
Now was as good a time as any 
to pump him for what he knew 
about Pendleton's death. 

"So far as I know, menshar 
Pendleton offended no one. I do 
not know what duties he had to 
perform here, but he was a generous and courteous man." 

Eckert gnawed the dainty meat 
off a slender ulami bone and tried 
to appear casual in his questioning. 

"I am sure he was, Nayova. I 
am sure, too, that you were as 
kind to him as you have been to 
Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to you for that." 

Nayova seemed pleased. "We 
tried to do as well for menshar 
Pendleton as we could. While he 
was here, he had the house that 
you have now and we saw that 
he was supplied with food and all 
other necessities." 



Eckert had a sudden clammy 
feeling which quickly passed 
away. What Nayova had said was 
something he'd make sure Templin never heard about. He wiped 
his mouth on a broad, flat leaf 
that had been provided and took 
another sip of the wine. 

"We were shocked to find out 
that menshar Pendleton had killed himself. We knew him quite 
well and we could not bring ourselves to believe he had done such 
a tiling." 

Nayova's gaze slid away from 
him. "Perhaps it was the will of 
the Great One," he said vaguely. 
He didn't seem anxious to talk 
about it. 

Eckert stared bleakly at his 
wine glass and tried to put the 
pieces of information together. 
They probably had a taboo about 
self - destruction which would 
make it difficult to talk about. 
That would make it even harder 
for him to find out by direct questioning. 

A native fife trilled shrilly and 
a group of young men and women 
walked into the room. The circle 
broke to let them through and 
they came and knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands 
sharply, they retreated to the center of the circle and began the 
slow motions of a native dance. 

The sound of the fife softened 
and died and the slow monotonous beat of drums took its place. 



134 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The beat slowly increased and so 
did the rhythm of the dancers. 
The small fires at the comers of 
tlif hut were allowed to dwindle 
and the center of the circle became filled with the motions of 
shadows intermixed with the 
swift, sure movements of glistening limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently 
the dance was the Tunpeshan version of the rites de passage. He 
glanced across the circle at Temptin.. Templin's face — what he 
could see of it by the flickering 
light — was brick red. 

A voice spoke in his ear. "It is 
hard for us to imagine anybody 
doing what menshar Pendleton 
did. It is . . ." andtie used a native 
word that Eckert translated as 
being roughly equivalent to "obscene." 

The dancers at the center of the 
circle finally bowed out with 
small garlands of flowers on their 
heads that signified their reaching 
adulthood. Acrobats then took the 
stage and went throuh a dizzying routine, and they in turn were 
succeeded by a native singer. 

They were all excellent, Eckert 
thought. If anything, they were 
too good. 

The bowl of pelache nuts made 
its way around again and Nayova 
leaned over to speak to him. "If 
there is any possibility that I can 
help you while you are here, mens/iar Eckert, you have but to ask." 



It would probably be a mistake 
to ask for a list of Pendleton's 
friends, but there was a way 
around that. "I would like to meet 
any of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them 
in any way." 

"I think they would be glad to 
help you. I shall ask them to go 
to you this coming week." 

IT wasn't a driving rain, just a 
gentle drizzle that made the 
lanes muddy and plastered Eckert's tunic against him. He didn't 
mind it; the rain was warm and 
the trees and grass smelted good 
in the wet. 

"How would you classify the 
culture after seeing the ceremony, 
Ted?" Templin asked. 

"About what you would expect. 
An Apollonian culture, simple 
and dignified. Nothing in. excess, 
no striving for great emotional 
release." # 

Templin nodded soberly. "It 
grows on you, doesn't it? You 
find yourself getting to like the 
place. And I suppose that's dangerous, too. You tend to let your 
guard down, the way Pendleton 
must have. You — what was that?" 

Eckert tensed. There was a gentle padding in the mud, several 
hundred feet behind them. Templin flattened himself in the shadows alongside a house. His hand 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



135 



darted inside his tunic and came 
out with the slim deadliness of a 
needle gun. 

"Don't use it !" Eckert whispered tersely. 

Templin's eyes were thin, 
frightened slits in the darkness. 
"Why not?" 

Eckert's mind raced. It might 
be nothing at all, and then again 
it might be disaster. But there 
was still a chance that Templin 
might be wrong. And there were 
more immediate reasons. 

"How many charges do you 
have for that?" 

"Twelve." 

"You think you can stand there 
and hold them off with only 
twelve charges for your needle 
gun?" 

"There's my power pack." 



"It's no good," Eckert said softly. "The batteries in it are dead. 
I was afraid you might do something foolish with it." 

The footsteps were only yards 
away. He listened intently, but it 
was hard to tell how many there 
were by the sound. 

"What do we do then?" 

"See if they're following us 
fi rst,' ' Eckert said practically. 
''They might not be, you know." 

They slid out from the shadows 
and ducked down another lane 
between the houses. The footsteps 
behind them speeded up and came 
down the same lane. 

"We'll have to head back for 
our house," Eckert whispered. 

They started running as quietly 
as they could, slipping and sliding in the mud. Another stretch 





 



past the shuttered, crouching 
houses and they found themselves 
in the square they had visited on 
the day they had landed. It was 
deserted, the looms and pottery 
wheels covered with cloth and 
reeds to keep off the rain. They 
darted across it, two thin shadows 
racing across the open plaza, and 
hurried down another path. 



The last path led to the small 
river that cut through the city. 
Templin looked around, gestured 
to Eckert, waded into the water 
and crouched under the small 
bridge that spanmed it. Eckert 
swore silently to himself, then followed Templin in. 

The cold water swirled under 
his armpits and he bit his lips to 




THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



137 



keep himself from sneezing. 
Templin's emotions were contagious. Would he have worried 
about the footsteps? He frowned 
and tried to be honest with himself. Perhaps he would — and perhaps he wouldn't have. But he 
couldn't have let Templin stay 
there and face the unknown ap-' 
proachers. Not Templin. 

Footsteps approached the 
« bridge, hesitated a moment, then 
pattered on the wooden structure 
and faded off down the muddy 
path. Eckert let his breath out 
slowly. The footsteps were curiously light. 

There was only one pair of 
them . 

"¥ WOULD like to know some■* thing," Templin said coldly. 
He stripped off his power pack 
and let it fall to the floor of their 
house. "Why did you decide to 
substitute dead batteries in the 
pack?" 

"Because," Eckert said shortly, 
"I was afraid you would do something with it that you might regret later. You're inexperienced in 
situations like this. Your reactions 
aren't to be trusted. One false 
move here and we could follow 
Pendleton, however he died. You 
know that." He wriggled out of 
his tunic and slowly peeled off his 
wet trousers. 

There was a timid knock at the 
door. He wrapped a blanket about 



himself and motioned to Templin 
to stand to one side. Templin 
grabbed a small stool, hefted it 
in one hand, and complied. 

Eckert went to the door and 
casually threw it open. 

A girl stood there, half in the 
outer darkness and half in the 
yellowish light from the room, 
covered with mud to the knees 
and drenched to the skin. 

"The menshar forgot this at the 
halera," she said joftly. She 
quickly handed him his pipe and 
a soggy bag of tobacco, and disappeared instantly into the rain. 
He listened for the sound of her 
footsteps in the soft mud and 
then closed the door. 

Templin put down the stool 
and stared stupidly at the pipe 
and the tobacco sack. Eckert 
placed them carefully on the table 
and began to towel himself. 

"We probably face as much 
danger from our own imaginations as from anything else." he 
said grimly. "Tell me, would you 
have fired first, or would you have 
waited until you found out for 
sure who she was and what she 
wanted when she first started to 
follow us?" 

"I don't know," Templin said 
sullenly. 

"Then I'll leave to your imagination the position we would be 
in now, if you had given in to 
your impulse."

""VT7E haven't found out much, 

** have we?" Templin demanded some days later. 

"No," Eckert admitted. "We 
haven't." 

He riffled through the thick 
stack of cards on the table. Statistically, the results were not only 
interesting but slightly phenomenal. During the three years or 
so that Pendleton had been on 
Tunpesh, he had met and known 
approximately seven hundred of 
the natives. By far the greater 
majority of these, of course, were 
purely casual and meant nothing. Almost a hundred, though, 
had had extended relations with 
Pendleton in business or social 
affairs. Of this hundred, none — 
not a single one — would admit 
that he had known Pendleton well 
or could be considered a friend of 
his. About all they had to say 
was that Pendleton had been 
healthy and easy to get along 
with, and one warm night he had 
shocked the community by going 
off and shooting himself. 

"Like Richard Cory," Eckert 
said aloud. * 

"Like who?" Templin asked. 

"Richard Cory. A character in 
a poem by a Twentieth Century 
poet, Edwin Arlington Robinson. 
Apparently he had everything to 
live for, but 'Richard Cory, one 
calm summer night, went home 
and put a bullet through his 
head.' " 



'TH have to look it up some 
day," Templin said. He pointed 
to the stack of cards. "That's so 
much waste paper, isn't it?" 

"Yes, it is," Eckert said reluctantly. "To be frank, I had hoped 
we'd know a lot more by now. I 
still can't understand, why we 
haven't dug up anybody who will 
admit having been his friend." 

"How do you know they're telling the truth? Or, for that matter, 
how do you know that the ones 
we've seen so far are the ones who 
actually knew Pendleton?" 

Eckert drummed his fingers on 
the table. You handle different 
human cultures tor twenty-five 
years and you get to the point 
where you can tell if people are 
lying or not. Or do you? Maybe 
just an old man's conceit. Age 
alone never lent wisdom. Regardless of the personal reasons that 
Templin might have for thinking 
the Tunpeshans are lying, the fact 
remains that they very easily 
could be. And what should you do 
if they are? 

There was a polite knock at the 
door. 

"We've got another visitor," 
Templin said sarcastically. "He 
probably saw Pendleton at a halera four years ago and wants to 
be sure we know all about it." 

The Tunpeshan looked faintly 
familiar to Eckert. There was 
something about the man's carriage . . • 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



139 



"I met you the day you landed," the Tunpeshan began, and 
Eckert remembered. Jathong, the 
guide who had shown them to the 
house. 

"You knew Pendleton?" 

Jathong nodded. "I and a fellow weaver took over his small 
office after he had left it." Eckert 
recalled the small office in the 
square with the bolts of cloth on 
display, and the small mud brick 
on the window ledge with the incised lettering reading: 

DONALD PENDLETON. SERVICE ATTACHE. 

"Why you didn't tell us this 
before?" 

"I didn't know what kind and 
how much information you wanted.*' 

We didn't ask him, Eckert 
thought, so he didn't vofuntepr 
any information. Polite, to say the 
least. 

"How long did you know him?" 

"Since he landed. I was the one 
appointed to him." 

"What do you mean — appointed to him?" 

"To try to learn his language, 
and try to teach him ours." 

Eckert felt his interest rising. 
Jathong, then, must have known 
Pendleton fairly well. 

"Did he have any enemies that 
you know of?" 

"Enemies?" Jathong seemed ignorant of , the meaning of the 
word, so Eckert explained. "No, 



he had no enemies. He would 
naturally have none such on 
Tunpesh." 

Templin leaned forward, tense. 
"If he had no enemies, why did 
he have no friends? You, for example, knew him longer and better than most. Why is it that you 
weren't his friend?" 

Jathong looked unhappy, as if 
being forced to say something he 
wanted not to say. "Pendleton 
was kava — 1 cannot explain it. 
The concept is difficult. You 
would not understand." 

He might be running the danger of throwing too many questions at Jath'ong, Eckert 'realized, 
and having him freeze up or turn 
vague. But it couldn't be helped. 
They had made no progress at all 
by subtlety, and time would eventually run out. 

He tried to broach the next 
question delicately. "Did Pendleton know any of the women of 
your race?" 

"'He knew some of the women, 
as he knew the men." 

The answer didn't tell Eckert 
what he wante'd to know. "Was he 
in love with any woman?" It 
sounded crude the way he put it, 
but it was hard to think of any 
other way of asking it. 

JATHONG looked at him incredulously, as if Eckert had 
asked him if Pendleton had had 
two heads. 



140 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



"That would have been impossible. None of our women would 
have — could have — been in love 
with menshar Pendleton." 

One line of inquiry /US* gone 
phht, Eckert thought. But Pendleton wasn't one to let a broken 
heart get him down anyway. 

"Why not?" Templin cut in 
harshly. "He wasn't hard to look 
at and he would have made a 
good husband." 

Jathong diplomatically turned 
around to face Templin. "I have 
told you once — Pendleton was 
Itava. It would have been quite 
impossible" 

The answer to what had happened to Pendleton probably lay 
in Jathong's inability to explain 
his own terms, Eckert believed. 
One could get just so close, and 
then the definitions became vague 
and useless. 

He asked a few more questions 
and finally dismissed Jathong. 
The interview, like all the others 
he and Templin had held during 
the last week, had been worthless. 
They knew nothing more than 
they had when they landed, 

"I still thing they're lying," 
Templin said almost savagely. 
"Or perhaps the ones who really 
know something haven't come 
around." 

PACKER T got his pipe and sat 
near the doorway, letting the 
sunlight streaming through the 



foliage of a nearby tree dapple 
his face with a checkerboard pattern of modulated lights and velvety shadows. 

"If they're evading us or if 
they're lying, then the society is 
a dangerous one for us. But I still 
can't believe it. They're not warlike. They don't seem to have 
many weapons and definitely 
none of an advanced type." 

"How could anybody know for 
sure?" 

Eckert methodically knocked 
the cold ashes out of his pipe and 
added more tobacco. "Easy. Despite what you read in story 
books, no civilization lives simply, 
governs itself simply, and yet possesses 'super-blasters.' The swordand - blaster combination just 
doesn't exist. Any weapon above 
the level of bows and arrows or 
knives is the product of a well advanced technology. Along with 
weapons, of course, you have to 
have good communications. Now 
take an ordinary radio and think 
of the degree of knowledge, technology, and industrialization that 
would have to exist to supply it. 
There's nothing like that here." 

Templin came over to the 
warmth streaming in through the 
doorway. "It almost seems that 
they're acting in concert, though 
— as if there were some kind of 
plot, where, by prearrangement, 
everybody knows exactly what to 
say." 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORO 



141 



"You're wrong again. You can 
practically smell a dictatorship or 
a tyranny, which is the only situation in which almost one hundred 
per cent of the population will follow the same line through fear of 
the consequences if they don't. In 
a situation like that, the people 
are frightened, unhappy. You can 
hardly say that's the case on Tunpesh." 

"No," Templin admitted, "you 
couldn't. But, still, you have to 
admit that the answers we've received so far are just too unanimous — and too sketchy. All agree 
that Pendleton was a fine fellow; 
alt agree that he had no native 
friends." 

Eckert nodded. "I'll go along 
with that. And I think it's time 
we did something about it. Tonight we'll have to start eliminating certain ideas." 

He took a small case from their 
pile of luggage and opened it. Inside was a small, battery-powered 
box with various dials set on the 
front and the usual electrodes and 
nerve probes protruding from the 
sides and the top. 

Templin looked at it with surprise. 

"That will be dangerous to use, 
won't it?" 

"It might be more dangerous 
not to. Time is getting to be a 
factor and we have to make some 
progress. We have a safety margin 
of a sort in that we can erase 



memories of its use, but the procedure is still risky." 

"Who do we use it on?" 

"As long as we're going to use 
it," Eckert said grimly, "we might 
as well start at the top." 

When they had started out, the 
investigation had seemed fairly 
simple to Eckert. There were two 
possibilities — either Pendleton 
had committed suicide or he had 
been murdered. Knowing Pendleton's record, the first possibility 
had seemed remote. A few weeks 
on Tunpesh had convinced htm 
that the second possibility was 
also remote. One or the other had 
to be eliminated. The second 
would be the easiest. 

There were other reasons as 
well. Templin was still convinced 
that Pendleton had been killed, 
and Templin was an emotional 
man with access to powerful 
weapons. The question was not 
what he might eventually do, but 
when. 

THE night looked as if it would 
be another rainy one. It was 
cooler than usual and dark clouds 
were scudding across the starlit 
sky. Eckert and Templin stood 
in the shadows of the house, 
watching the dark lane for any 
casual strollers. Eckert looked at 
his watch. A few minutes more 
and Nayova would come out for 
his evening walk. 

Eckert had just started to think 



Ml 




 



longingly of his bed and the 
warmth inside his house when the 
door opened and Nayova appeared in the opening. Eckert held 
his breath while the chieftain 
stood uncertainly in the doorway, 
testing the night air, and then let 
it out slowly when Nayova started 
down the lane. 

They closed in on him. 

"The menshars from Earth," 
he said without alarm. "Is there 
something you wish?" 

"We would like you to come 
with us to our house for a while," 
Eckert started in. 

Nayova looked puzzled. "I do 
not understand. Would not tomorrow do as well?" 

"I'm afraid it'll have to be tonight." 

Nayova was obviously not quite 
sure of their threat. 
"No, I . . ." 

Eckert caught him before he 
touched the ground. Templin took 
the rag off the butt of the needle 
gun, lifted the ruler's feet, and 
they disappeared into the brush 
along the lane. 

They would have to sneak back 
to the house, Eckert knew, and 
hope that nobody saw them lugging the unconscious native. He 
laughed a little grimly to himself. 
Templin had expected cloak-anddagger. It looked as if he was 
going to get more than his share 
of it, after all. 

Once inside the house, Eckert 



arranged the electrodes and the 
small nerve probes on Nayova, 
who had come to. 

"I am sorry,*' Eckert said formally," but we find this necessary. 
You understand that we have to 
find out all we can about Pendleton. We have no choice." 

He found it difficult to look the 
ruler in the face, even with the 
realization that this was strictly 
in the line of duty and that the 
chieftain would not be hurt. 

"But I have cooperated with 
you in every way possible!" Nayova protested. "I have told you 
everything we know!" 

"That's right," Templin said 
bluntly, "And now we're going to 
ask you the same questions." 

Nayova looked blank for a moment and then reddened as he 
understood. 




IEMPL1N turned to the dials 
on the little square box. 



"We would like to know," Eckert said politely, "where you were 
two weeks ago at this time of 
night." 

Nayova looked surprised. "You 
know that I was at the ha/era, 
the coming-of-age ceremony. You 
were there with me, as my guests. 
You should assuredly know I was 
there." 

Eckert looked over at Templin, 
who nodded shortly. It had been 
a standard question, to test the 
apparatus. 



THE FIEE AND THE SWOID 



143 



"Did Pendleton have any enemies here on Tunpesh?" 

Nayova emphatically shook his 
head. "To the best of my knowledge, menshar Pendleton had no 
enemies here. He would have 
none." 

Templin's face showed its disappointment. 

"Who were his friends?" 

"He had no friends." 

Templin glowered angrily, but 
he said nothing. 

Eckert frowned. The same answer — Pendleton had had no enemies and yet he had had no 
friends. 

"Would you say he was well 
liked here?" 

"I would say no." 
"Why not?" 

A shrug. "It is hard to explain 
and you would not be able to 
understand." 

"Did somebody here kill Pendleton?" 

Eckert could hear Templin 
suck in his breath. 

"No." 

''Ask him that again," Templin 
cut in. 

"Did somebody kill Pendleton?" 
J'No." 

''Did Pendleton kill himself?" 
A trace of disgust showed on 
Nayova's face. 
"Yes." 
"V?hy?" 

"I do not know." 



Templin gestured to Eckert to 
take the box. "Let me ask him." 
He came around and faced the 
native. "Why did your people kilt 
Pendleton?" 

"We did not kill him. We had 
no reason to wish him harm." 

"Do you expect us- to believe 
that Pendleton killed himself? We 
knew him better than that." 

"You may believe whatever 
you wish. But men change and 
perhaps he did. We did not kill 
him. Such an act would have been 
repugnant to us." 

"I think that's enough," Eckert 
said calmly. 

Templin bit his lip as Eckert 
touched another dial on the machine. Nayova suddenly jerked, 
looked blank, and slumped in the 
chair. 

Eckert took off the electrodes. 
"Help me take him back, will 
you, Ray?" 

^T^HEY carried Nayova to his 
house, stayed with him until 
he showed signs of recovering, and 
then left. 

"Why didn't you use a drug?" 
Templin demanded. 

"Possible allergy or serum reaction. We don't know enough 
about these people to take 
chances — they're humanoid, not 
human." 

"They can fool machines, 
though, can't they?" 

Eckert didn't reply. 



144 




 



"All right, I know they can't," 
Tcmplin sai<J grudgingly. "He 
was telling the truth all the time, 
wasn't he?" 

Eckert nodded. "I never did 
think he was lying. They don't 
seem to be the type; their culture 
doesn't allow for it." 

They were silent for a while, 
walking quietly in the lanes between the shuttered , seem ingly 
untenanted houses. 

"I'm glad," Templin said quietly. "It's off my mind. It's hard 
to believe that anybody here 
would . . . deliberately kill somebody else." 

Templin's reactions would be 
worth something now for Eckert 
to study. They wouldn't be inhibited by his conviction that the 
natives had murdered his best 
friend. Just what reactions and 
emotions he would display, Eckert wasn't sure, nor how Templin's psychology, so similar to 
Pendleton's, would help solve the 
problem. 

They had eliminated one possibility, but that still left them 
with the one they had started 
with. 

Why had Pendleton taken the 
short way out? 

A BREEZE scampered through 
the open door and played tag 
with the papers on the desk. Eckert swore without annoyance and 
calmly started chasing those that 



had been blown on the floor. 

"What did Pendleton have to 
say in his reports?" Templin sat 
in the doorway, his eyes barely 
open. He had begun taking siestas 
in the early afternoon, after their 
usual light lunch. It was pleasant 
to sit on the worn wood and feel 
the warmth of sun and smell the 
crisp freshness of the outdoors, or 
maybe watch the kids playing in 
the lane, catching the butterflies 
that floated past in the afternoon 
air. 

"About what you'd expect. 
Mostly reports on the industry, 
climate, system of government, 
and general anthropological information that he thought might 
prove interesting. As far as I can 
see, he didn't lack enthusiasm for 
making the reports. If anything, 
he grew more enthusiastic as time 
went on. He practically wrote us 
treatises on every phase of life on 
Tunpesh." 

Templin's eyes closed all the 
way. 

"Any indication in his reports 
that he didn't like it here?" 

"Just the other way around. 
Everything points to the fact that 
he liked the climate, the people, 
the way they lived." 

"I don't blame him," Templin 
murmured. "This is a lovely place 
to be. The climate is wonderful, 
the people are happy, hard-working. The society itself seems to be 
— perfect. Sometimes you can't 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



M5 



help but compare it too damn 
favorably to Earth." 

Eckert shoved the papers to one 
side and came over to where 
Tempi in sat. He felt rather lazy 
himself. The warmth and sunshine rorroded ambition, as it did 
in most, climates like this. 

"You know, there isn't any 
crime here/' Templin continued. 
He laughed to himself. "Except 
the minor crime wave we caused 
when we landed here five months 
ago. No criminals, no villains foreclosing mortgages, no gamblers 
bleeding the gullible white, and 
nobody trying to sell gold bricks. 
I can't get over it." 

A BUTTERFLY flapped into 
the sunlight that glistened on 
his tunic, like a drop of water on a 
piece of black velvet. It hung 
there for a moment and then was 
off, its wings flashing. 

Eckert watched it go in a sort 
of torpor. It was pleasant to relax 
and slip the leash off your 
thoughts quietly and see where 
they took you. Maybe it was a 
sort of letdown. They had expected six months of danger in a 
potentially criminal culture, and 
instead it had been paradise. 

As Templin said, you couldn't 
help but compare it to Earth. No 
greed, no belligerency, no contempt for the rights of others. No 
cynicism, no sarcasm, and no 
trampling crowds in the stores. 



The little important things . . ■ 
"Where did you go last night, 
Ray?" 

Templin stirred. "A community 
meeting. Almost like a Quaker 
meeting. You get up and say what 
you think. The one last night was 
about some local government issues. They talked it over, decided 
what to do, and how much each 
person should contribute. The 
original democracy, Ted." 

Eckert was wide awake. "I 
wonder why I wasn't invited." He 
felt slightly put out that Templin 
should have been asked to something like that and he hadn't 
been. 

"I wasn't Invited." Templin 
said. "I invited myself." 

"Have you noticed," Eckert 
mused, "we haven't been invited 
to too many functions lately?" 

"They know we're busy," 
Templin said lazily. "They're too 
polite to ask us to go some place 
if they thought we were busy doing something else." 

"You like it here, don't you, 
Ray?" 

Templin brushed idly at a marauding mosquito. "It took me 
pretty long to warm up to it. but 
I guess I do." 

They only had a month left, 
Eckert knew — a month to do 
practically nothing but lie in the 
sun and watch the people. Oh, 
they could go through the motions of investigating and look

over Pendleton's old records and 
reports, but there was nothing in 
them of any value. 

He yawned and sat down and 
settled his back against the door 
frame. It began to look as if 
they'd never find out why Pendleton had done what he had. And 
it didn't seem to matter, somehow. 

I^CKERT opened the door 
-"- J slowly. Templin was asleep 
on the bed, the sunlight lying in 
bands across his tanned, bare 
back. He had on a strip of white 
cloth, knotted at the waist in 
imitation of what the natives 
wore. 

It was mussed now, and the 
knot had started to come loose. 

He looked a lot healthier than 
he had when they had first landed. More peaceful, more content. 
He appeared to have gained ten 
pounds and shed five years in the 
last six months. 

And now the vacation was over. 
It was time to go back. 

"Ray," Eckert called out to 
him softly. 

Templin didn't stir, but continued his soft and very regular 
breathing. 

Eckert found a book and dropped it on the floor with a thud. 
Templin woke up, but didn't 
move. 

"What do you want, Ted?" 
"How did you know it was me?" 



Templin chuckled, as if it were 
hugely funny. "Riddles yet. Who 
else would it be? No Tunpesnan 
would be rude enough to wake 
somebody up in the middle of anap, so it had to be you." 

"You know what you would 
have done if somebody had awakened you like that five months 
ago?" 

Templin tried to nod, but was 
slightly handicapped by the bed 
underneath him. "I would have 
pulled my trusty atomgun and 
plugged him." 

Eckert went over to where they 
kept their luggage and started 
pulling the boxes out from the 
wall. "Well, I've got good news 
for you. A liner just landed to 
pick us up. They were going 
through this sector and they got 
an order from the Service to stop 
by for us. Some cargo -wallopers 
will be here in a few minutes to, 
help us with our gear." 

"Ted." 

Eckert paused. 
"Yes?" 

"I'm not going back." 

"Why not?" Eckert's face had 
a look of almost clinical curiosity 
on it. 

"Why should I? I like it here. 
I want to live here the rest of my 
life." 

*|"*HE pieces began to fall in 
place. 

"I'm not so sure you'd like it.

Ray. Not after a while. All your 
friends are back on Earth. Everybody you know is back there. It's 
just the novelty of something new 
and something different here. I've 
felt that way a lot of times in 
different cultures and different societies. You'd change your mind 
after a while." 

"Those aren't reasons, Ted. 
Why should I go back to a world 
where most of the people are unhappy at some time and a few 
people all the time? As far as I'm 
concerned, Tunpesh is my home 
now. and I don't intend to leave 
it." 

Eckert was fascinated. It was 
like a case history unfolding right 
before his eyes. 

"Are you sure you would enjoy 
it here for the rest of your life? 
Have you made any friends to 
take the place of those back 
home?" 

"It takes time to become acquainted, even more time to make 
friends," Templin said defensive
ft 

"You can't desert the Service," 
Eckert pointed out. "You still 
have your duty." 

Templin laughed in his pillow. 
"It won't work, Ted. Duty's just 
a catch word, a jingo phrase. 
They can get along without me 
»nd you know it." 

"What about Pendleton, Ray?" 
He died here, you know, in mysterious circumstances." 



"Would going back help him 
any? He wasn't murdered; we 
know that. And why do people 
commit suicide? For what one of 
several thousand possible reasons 
did Pendleton? We don't know. 
We'll never know. And if we did 
know, what good would it do?" 




He had changed a lot in six 
months. Eckert saw. 
Too much. 

"What if I told you I knew 
why Pendleton killed himself?" 
Eckert asked. "And that you 
would do the same if you stayed 
here?" 

"Don't use it, Ted. It's poor 
psychology. It won't work."

The pieces made a perfect picture. But Templin was going back 
whether he wanted to or not. The 
only difficulty was that, deep underneath, Eckert sympathized 
with him. Perhaps if he had been 
younger, less experienced . . . 

"Then you won't go back with 
Us?" 

Templin closed his eyes and 
rolled over on his back. "No." 

There was dead silence. Templin could smell the piny scent of 
the woods and feel the warmth of 
soft sunlight that lanced through 
the blinds. Some place far away, 





there was the faint chatter of kids 
at play, but outside of that it was 
quiet. 

Too quiet. 

Templin opened his eyes in 
sudden alarm. "Ted! Don't!" He 
caught the gas full in the face and 
tumbled back on the bed, unconscious. 

UCKERT opened the hatch to 
* J the observation cabin as quietly as he could. Templin was 
seated on one of the pneumatic 
couches, staring soberly at a small

yellow star in the black sky. He 
didn't look up. 

"It's me, Ray," Eckert said. 

Templin didn't move. 

"I suppose I owe you an apology," Eckert began, "but I had to 
gas you to get you to leave. 
Otherwise you wouldn't have left. 
And the same thing would have 
happened to you that happened 
to Don Pendleton." 

"You're sure of that?" Templin 
asked bitterly. 

"Reasonably. You're a lot like 
Pendleton, you know. In fact, 
that's why you were selected to 
go — not so much because you 
knew him as the fact that psychologically you were a lot like 
him. We thought that by studying your response to situations 
there,*we would have a picture of 
wbat Pendleton's must have 
been." 

Templin didn't want to talk 
about it, Eckert realized, but it 
had to be explained to him. 

"Do you 'want to know why 
Pendleton killed himself?" 

Templin shrugged listlessly. 

"I suppose we should have seen 
it right away," Eckert continued. 
"Any race that is so happy with 
their way of life that they show 
no curiosity about strangers, the 
way they live, or what possessions 
they have, must have something 
to be happy about. Tunpesh is 
something that might happen 
only once in a thousand civiliza


tions, maybe less, Ray. 

"The environment is perfection 
and so are the people, or at least 
as near to perfection as it's possible to get. An intelligent people 
who have as much technology as 
they desire, living simply with 
themselves and each other. A fluke 
of nature, perhaps. No criminals, 
no insane, no neurotics. A perfect 
cultural pattern. Tunpesh is a 
paradise. You didn't want to 
leave, neither did I, and neither " 
did Pendleton." 

" Templin turned on him. "So it 
was paradise. Would it have been 
criminal if I had stayed there? 
Who would it have hurt?" 

"It would have hurt you," Eckert said gravely. "Because the 
Tunpeshans would never have accepted you. We're too different, 
Ray. We're too aggressive, too 
pushy, too persistent. We're not 
—perfect. You see, no matter how 
long we stayed there, we would 
never have fit in. We lived in a 
harsh society and we bear the 
scars of it. Our own environment 
has conditioned us, and we can't 
change. Oh, we could try, but it 
would crop up in little ways. Because of that, the natives could 
never genuinely like us. We'd 
never belong. Their own cultural 
pattern wouldn't allow them to 
accept us. 

"Their cultural pattern- is like 
the Fire and the Sword that were 
placed outside the Garden of 



150 




 



Eden, after Adam and Eve were 
driven out, to keep it sacrosanct. 
If you're an outsider, you stay 
outside. You can never come in." 

HE paused a moment, waiting 
for Templin to say something. Templin didn't. 

"The natives have a word for 
it. Kava. It means, I suppose, different — not necessarily inferior, 
just different. We should have 
seen it as time went on. We 
weren't invited places; they seemed to avoid us. A natural reaction 
for them, I guess I have to admit." 

Eckert cleared his throat huskily. "You see, what happened to 
Pendleton," he continued awkwardly, "is that he fell in love 
with paradise, but paradise would 
have nothing to do with him. By 
the time three years were up, he 
knew that he was an outcast in 
Eden. And he couldn't leave, to 
come back and try to forget. He 
was stranded in paradise and had 
to look forward to spending four 
more years there as a pariah. He 
couldn't do it. And neither could 
you." 

He was quiet for a moment, 
thinking of the cool, scented air 
and the warm sunshine and the 
happy kids playing on the grassy 
lanes. 

"I suppose it didn't affect you 
at all, did it?" Templin asked 
venomously. 



\ SHADOW crossed Eckerfa 
** l face. "You should know better than that, Ray. Do you think 
I'll ever forget it? Do you think 
I'll ever be satisfied with my own 
culture again?*' 

"What are you going to do 
about it?" 

"It's dangerous to human beings, Ray. Looking at it brutally, 
their culture has killed two of our 
people as surely as if Tunpesh 
were populated by murderous 
savages. We'll probably send a 
larger commission, throw it open 
to commerce, try to change it." 

Templin gripped the sides of 
the couch, his face strained and 
tense with anxiety. "What happens to it depends on the report 
you make, doesn't it?" 

"Yes, it does." 

"Then make up something in 
your report. Say the climate is 
bad for Earthmen. Say anything, 
but don't let them change Tunpesh !" 

Eckert looked at him for a long 
moment, remembering. 

"Okay, Ray," he said slowly. 
"We'll leave paradise alone. 
Strictly alone. It'll be put on the 
quarantine list." 

He turned and left. 

Behind him, Templin swiveled 
around in his chair and gazed 
bleakly at the tiny mote of yellow 
fading in the blackness of space.
