Ask A Foolish Question 



THE questions laymen ask 
cabbies, doctors, engineers, 
soda jerkers and so on 
would no doubt make a fascinating monograph. The one asked 
most often of writers, and especially writers of science fiction, is, 
"Where do you get those ideas?" 

Actually, this is perhaps the 
least significant question a reader 
can ask. Ideas come from anywhere — newspapers, overheard 
conversations, books, other writers' stories, speculation both idle 
and frantic, depending, of course, 
on whether a deadline must be 
met 

Only rarely does a writer remember the instant of inspiration. 
Out of the hundreds of stories and 
scripts I have written, for instance, I recall only one such moment. I was trudging through the 
rain without an umbrella, the 
usual random thoughts blurting 
and mumbling in my mind, when 
I found myself sub-vocalizing an 
old song having to do with walking between raindrops. That 
started a mental train ending with 
a caboose called Trouble With 
Water, which P. G. Wodehouse 
is being good enough to include 
in an anthology of modern humor. 

All my other writing, though, 
has been the result of mostly har


ried and often morose discarding 
of one idea after another. This is 
generally true of professional 
writers. When an idea worth writing — or one that seems to be — is 
finally dredged up, skinny and 
pale and unlovely, it is almost 
always surrounded by the even 
skinnier cadavers of dud notions. 

The layman's question should 
be, "What do you do with ideas 
once you get them?" 

Beyond Bedlam, this month's 
novella, introducing a literarily 
muscular new writer named Wyman Guin, is a fine example. Its 
genesis is the statistical fact that 
the hospital load of schizophrenic 
patients is steadily rising. How 
this should come to Guin's attention is not remarkable — he's 
advertising director of Lakeside 
Laboratories, a pharmaceutical 
house, and keeping up with medical science is an important part 
of his job. 

Well, this is approximately 
where he got his idea. 

As you can see, that doesn't 
answer the big question — what 
did Guin do with his idea? 

There were several plot directions that he explored systematically: 

• The hypothetical causes of the 
great increase, such as secret 



A FOOLISH QUESTION 



I 



weapons, invasions from space, 
mental instead of embryonic 
twinning, etc. Unable to make 
himself violate established psychiatric theory, Guin abandoned 
this line of thought. 

• The possible effects on civilization if a minority of non-psychotics had to support a majority of 
hospitalized schizophrenes. Not 
bad, but not enough to make a 
story, so he combined it with: 

• A society in which schizophrenia is the norm. 

Presumably, now that the author knew what his attack was to 
be, his biggest problem was 
•olved. It was. actually, just beginning. For example . . . 

• Should he build the proposed 
society for horror, humor, moralistic analogy, warning, or what? 

• Should the characters he rational or irrational by our standards? 

• Since all stories need character 
conflict, what would be the basis 
for it in this fictional setup? 

If Guin had been writing conventional science fiction, he could 
have worked it out very easily : 

• A society created for horror 
through violence, by exaggerating 
present so-called normal behavior; pre-scientific "humor" as in 
the 18th Century attitude toward 
psychosis; effortless political satire to show how similar our society is to a psychotic one. 

• Irrational characters, of course, 



for melodramatic purposes. 

• Conflict on the grand scale — 
rebels, normal according to our 
view, who want to overturn the 
schizophrenic world. 

Guin. however, had read hundreds of stories like that. What 
lover of science fiction hasn't? 
And so , . . 

• We have a schizophrenic society with a system of ethics, education, morals, laws, etiquette, 
interpersonal and inrrapersonal 
relationships that are consistent 
with its psychological basis. 

• Since the only unchanging aspect of standards is that they are 
constantly changing, the characters must be rational by their own 
standards and not ours. 

• Conflict should come from the 
interpersonal and infrapersonal 
relationships that a schizophrenic 
society makes possible. Here Guin 
found really rich soil, as you'll 
discover when you read the story. 

HpHUS, asking Wyman Guin 
where he got the idea of Beyond Bedlam is recognizably 
mere social conversation. If he 
can answer it at all, it would reveal nothing whatever of the 
weeks of work that changed the 
seed of thought into a living, moving story. 

For those who want to slide 
into GALAXY with their first 
stories, and feel offended when

THE Qpening afternoon class 
for Mary Walden's egoshift was almost over, and 
Mary was practically certain the 
teacher would not call on her to 
recite her assignment, when Carl 
Blair got it into his mind to try 



to pass her a dirty note. Mary 
knew it would be a screamingly 
funny Ego-Shifting Room limerick and was about to reach for the 
note when Mrs. Harris's voice 
crackled through the room. 

"Carl Blair! I believe you have

an important message. Surely you 
will want the whole class to hear 
it. Come forward, please." 

As he made his way before the 
class, the boy's blush-covered 
freckles reappeared against his 
giowing pallor. Haltingly and in 
an agonized monotone, he recited 
from the note: • 

"There was a young hyper 
named Phil, 

Who kept a third head for a 
1 thrill. 

Said he, 'It's all right, 
1 I enjoy my plight. 
' I shift my third out when it's 
chill/ * 

The class didn't dare laugh. 
Their eyes burned down at their 
laps in shame. Mary managed 
to throw Carl Blair a compassionate glance as he returned to 
his seat, but she instantly regretted ever havi ng been kind 
to him. 

"Mary Walden, you seemed 
uncommonly interested in reading something just now. Perhaps 
you wouldn't mind reading your 
assignment to the class." 

There it was, and just when 
the class was almost over. Mary 
could have scratched Carl Blair. 
She clutched her paper grimly 
and strode to the front. 

"Today's assignment in Pharmacy History is, 'Schizophrenia 
since the Ancient Pre-pharmacy 
days.' " Mary took enough breath 
to get into the first paragraph. 



"Schizophrenia is where two or 
more personalities live in the 
same brain. The ancients of the 
20th Century actually looked 
upon schizophrenia as a disease! 
Everyone felt it was very shameful to have a schizophrenic person in the family, and, since 
children lived right with the same 
parents who had borne them, it 
was very bad. If you were a schizophrenic child in the 20th Century, you would be locked up 
behind bars and people would 
call you — " 

M a ry bl ushed and stu mbled 
over the daring word — "crazy." 
"The ancients locked up strong 
ego groups right along with weak 
ones. Today we would lock up 
those ancient people." 

THE class agreed silently. 
"But there were more and 
more schizophrenics to lock up. 
By 1950 the prisons and hospitals were so full of schizophrenic 
people that the ancients did not 
have room left to lock up any 
more. They were beginning to see 
that soon everyone would be 
schizophrenic. 

"Of course, in the 20th Century, the schizophrenic people 
were almost as helpless and 
*crazy* as the ancient Modern 
men. Naturally they did not fight 
wars and lead the silly life of the 
Moderns, but without proper 
drugs they couldn't control their

Ego-shiftability. The personalities in a brain would always be 
righting each other. One personality would cut the body or hurt 
it or make it filthy, so that when 
the other personality took over 
the body, it would have to suffer. 
No. the schizophrenic people of 
the 20th Century were almost as 
Vrazy' as the ancient Moderns. 

"But then the drugs were invented one by one and the schizophrenic people of the 20th Century were freed of their troubles. 
With the drugs the personalities 
of each body were able to live 
side by side in harmony at last. 
It turned out that many schizophrenic people, called overendowed personalities, simply had 
so many talents and viewpoints 
that it took two or more personalities to handle everything. 

"The drugs worked so well that 
the ancients had to let millions of 
schizophrenic people out from 
behind the bars of 'crazy* houses. 
That was the Great Emancipation of the 1990s. From then on, 
schizophrenic people had trouble 
only when they criminally didn't 
take their drugs. Usually, there 
are two egos in a schizophrenic 
person — the hyperalter, or prime 
ego, and the hypoalter, the alternate ego. There often were more 
than two. but the Medicorps 
makes us take our drugs so that 
won't happen to us. 

"At last someone realized that 



if everyone took the new drugs, 
the great wars would stop. At the 
World Congress of 1997, laws 
were passed to make everyone 
take the drugs. There were many 
fights over this because some people wanted to stay Modern and 
fight wars. The Medicorps was 
organized and told to kill anyone 
who wouldn't take their drugs as 
prescribed. Now the laws arc enforced and everybody takes the 
drugs and the hyperalter and 
hypoalter are each allowed to 
have the body for an ego-shift 
of five days . . 

Mary Walden faltered. She 
looked up at the faces of her 
classmates, started to turn to 
Mrs. Harris and felt the sickness 
growing in her head. Six great 
waves of crescendo silence washed through her. The silence swept 
away everything but the terror, 
which stood in her frail body like 
a shrieking rock. 

Mary heard Mrs. Harris hurry 
to the shining dispensary along 
one wall of the classroom and 
return to stand before her with a 
swab of antiseptic and a disposable syringe. 

Mrs. Harris helped her to a 
chair. A few minutes after the 
expert injection, Mary's mind 
struggled back from its core of 
silence. 

"Mary, dear, I'm sorry. I haven't been watching you closely 
enough."

"Oh, Mrs. Harris . . ." Mary's 
chin trembled. "I hope it never 
happens again." * 

"Now, child, we all have to go 
through these things when wt>e 
young. You're just a little slower 
than the others in acclimatizing 
to the drugs. You'll be fourteen 
soon and the medicop assures me 
you'll be over this sort of thing 
just as the others are." 

Mrs. Harris dismissed the class 
and when they had all filed from 
the room, she turned to Mary. 

"I think, dear, we should visit 
the clinic together, don't you?" 

"Yes, Mrs. Harris." Mary was 
not frightened now. She was just 
ashamed to be such a difficult 
child and so slow to acclimati2e 
to the drugs. 

As she and the teacher walked 
down the long corridor to the 
clinic, Mary made up her mind 
to tell the medicop what she 
thought was wrong. It was not 
herself. It was her hypoalter, that 
nasty little Susan Shorrs. Sometimes, when Susan had the h"***% 
the things Susan was dc' ..id 
thinking came to Ma;, like what 
the ancients had edited dreams, 
and Mary had never liked this 
secondary ego whom she could 
never really know. Whatever was 
wrong, it .was Susan's doing. The 
filthy creature never took care of 
her hair, it was always so messy 
when Susan shifted the body to 
her. 



Mrs. Harris waited while Mary 
went into the clinic. 

Mary was glad to find Captain 
Thiel, the nice medicop, on duty. 
But she was silent wh i le the 
*X-rays were being taken, and. of 
course, while he got the blood 
samples, she concentrated on being brave. 

Later, while Captain Thiel 
looked in her eyes with the bright 
little light, Mary said calmly, 
"'Do you know my hypoalter, 
Susan Shorrs?" ' 

The medicop drew back and 
made some notes on a pad before 
answering. "Why. yes. She's in 
here quite often too." 

"Does she look like me?" 

"Not much. She's a very nice 
little girl . . ." He hesitated, visibly fumbling. 

Mary blurted, "Tell me truly, 
what's she like?" 

Captain Thiel gave her his nice 
smile. "Well. I'll tell you a secret 
if you keep it to yourself." 

"Oh, I promisi ." 

He leaned over and whispered 
in her ear and she liked the clean 
odor of him. "She's not nearly as 
pretty as you are." 

Mary wanted very badly to 
put her arms around him and 
hug him. Instead, wondering if 
Mrs. Harris, waiting outside, had 
heard, she drew back self-consciously and said, "Susan is the 
cause of all this trouble, the nasty 
little thing."

"Oh now!" the medicop exclaimed. "I don't think so, Mary. 
She's in trouble, too, you know." 

"She still eats sauerkraut." 
Mary was defiant. 

"But what's wrong with that?'* 
"You told her not to last year 
because it makes me sick On my 
shift. But it agrees in buckets 
with a Uttle pig like her." 

The medicop took this seriously. He made a note on the 
pad. "Mary, you should have 
complained sooner/' 

"Do you think my father might 
not like me because Susan Shorrs 
is my hypoalter?" she asked 
abruptly. 

"I hardly think so, Mary. After 
all, he doesn't even know her. 
He's never on her Ego shift." 

"A little bit," Mary said, and 
was immediately frightened. 

Captain Thiel glanced at her 
sharply. "What do you mean by 
that, child?" 

"Oh, nothing," Mary said 
hastily. "I just thought maybe 
he was." 

"Let me see your pharmacase," 
he said rather severely. 

Mary slipped the pharmacase 
off the belt at her waist and 
. handed it to him. Captain Thiel 
extracted the prescription card 
from the back and threw it away. 
He slipped a new card in the 
taping machine on his desk and 
punched out a new prescription, 
which he reinserted in the phar


macase. In the space on the front, 
he wrote directions for Mary to 
take the drugs numbered from 
left to right. 

Mary watched his serious face 
and remembered that he had 
complimented her about being 
prettier than Susan. "Captain 
Thiel, is your hypoalter as handsome as you are?" 

The young medicop emptied 
the remains of the old prescription from the pharmacase and 
took it to the dispensary in the 
corner, where he slid it into the 
filling slot. He seemed unmoved 
by her question and simply muttered, "Much handsomer." 

The machine automatically 
filled the case from the punched 
card on its back and he returned 
it to Mary. "Are you taking your 
drugs exactly as prescribed? You 
know there are very strict laws 
about that, and as soon as you 
are fourteen, you will be held to 
them." 

Mary nodded solemnly. Great 
strait jackets, who didn't know 
there were laws about taking your 
drugs? 

There was a long pause and 
Mary knew she was supposed to 
leave. She wanted, though, to 
stay with Captain Thiel and 
talk with him. She wondered how 
it would be if he were appointed 
her father. 

Mary was not hurt that her 
shy compliment to him had gone 



* 




 



unnoticed. She had only wanted 
something to talk about. Finally 
she said desperately, "Captain 
Thiel, how is it possible for a 
body to change as much from 
one Ego shift to another as it 
does between Susan and me?" 

"There isn't all the change you 
imagine," he said. "Have you 
had your first physiology?" 

"Yes. I was very good . . .** 
Mary saw from his smile that 
her inadvertent little conceit had 
trapped her. 

"Then, Miss Mary Walden, 
how do you think it is possible?" 

Why did teachers and medicops have to be this way? When 
all you wanted was to have them 
talk to you, they turned everything around and made you 
think. 

She quoted unhappily from her 
schoolbook, "The main things in 
an ego shift are the two vegetative nervous systems that translate the conditions of either personality to the blood and other 
organs right from the brain. The 
vegetative nervous systems change 
the rate at which the liver burns 
or stores sugar and the rate at 
which the kidneys excrete . . ,** 

Through the closed door to the 
other room, Mrs. Harris's voice 
raised at the visiophone said distinctly, "But, Mr. Walden . . 

"Reabsorb," corrected Captain 
Thiel. 

"What?" She didn't know what 



to listen to— the medicop or the 
distant voice of Mrs. Harris. 

"It's better to think of the kidneys as reabsorbing salts and nutrients from the filtrated blood." 

"Oh." 

"But, Mr. Walden, we can 
overdo a good thing. The proper 
amount of neglect is definitely 
required for full development ot 
some personality types and Mary 
certainly is one of those . . ." 

"What about the pituitary 
gland that's attached to the brain 
and controls all the other glands 
during the shift of egos?" pressed 
Captain Thiel distractingly. 

"But, Mr. Walden, too much 
neglect at this critical point may 
cause another personality to split 
off and we can't have that. Adequate personalities are congenital. 
A new one now would only rob 
the present personalities. You are 
the appointed parent of this child 
and the Board of Education will 
enforce your compliance with our 
diagnosis . . ." 

Mary's mind leaped to a page 
in one of her childhood storybooks. It was an illustration of a 
little girl resting beneath a great 
tree that overhung a brook. There 
were friendly little wild animals 
about. Mary could see the page 
clearly and she thought about it 
very hard instead of crying. 

"Aren't you interested any 
more, Mary?" Captain Thiel was 
looking at her strangely.

The agitation in her voice was 
a surprise. "I have to get home. 
I have a lot of things to do." 

Outside, when Mrs. Harris 
seemed suddenly to realize that 
something was wrong, and delicately probed to find out whether 
her angry voice had been overheard, Mary said calmly and as 
if it didn't matter, "Was my 
father home when you called him 
before?" 

"Why — yes, Mary. But you 
mustn't pay any attention to conversations like that, darling." 

You can't force him to like me, 
she thought to herself, and she 
was angry with Mrs. Harris because now her father would only 
dislike her more. 

Neither her f ather nor her 
mother was home when Mary 
walked into the evening-darkened 
apartment. It was the first day of 
the family shift, and on that day, 
for many periods now. they had 
not been home until late. 

Mary walked through the 
empty rooms, turning on lights. 
She passed up the electrically 
heated dinner her father had set 
out for her. Presently she found 
herself at the storage room door. 
She opened it slowly. 

After hesitating a while she 
went in and began an exhausting 
search for the old storybook with 
the picture in ft. 

Finally she knew she could not 
find it. She stood in the middle 



of the junk-filled room and began 
to cry. 

rpHE day which ended fof 
* Mary Walden in lonely weeping should have been, for Conrad 
Manz. a pleasant rest day with 
an hour of rocket racing in the 
middle of it. Instead, he awakened with a shock to hear his wife 
actually talking while she was 
asleep. 

He stood over her bed and 
made certain that she was asleep. 
It was as though her mind 
thought it was somewhere else, 
doing something else. Vaguely he 
remembered that the ancients did 
something called dreaming while 
they slept and the thought made 
him shiver. 

Clara Manz was saying, "Oh, 
Bill, they'll catch us. We can't 
pretend any more unless we have 
drugs. Haven't we any drugs. 
Bill?" 

Then she was silent and lay 
still. Her breathing was shallow 
and even in the dawn light her 
cheeks were deeply flushed 
against the blonde hair. 

Having just awakened, Conrad 
was on a very low drug level and 
the incident was unpleasantly 
disturbing. He picked up his 
pharmacase from beside his bed 
and made his way to the bathroom. He took his hypothalamic 
block and the integration enzymes and returned to the bed

room. Clara was still sleeping. 

She had been behaving oddly 
for some time, but there had 
never been anything as disturbing 
as this. He felt that he should 
call a medicop, but, of course, he 
didn't want to do anything that 
extreme. It was probably something with a simple explanation. 
Clara was a little scatterbrained 
at times. Maybe she had forgotten to take her sleeping compound and that was what caused 
dreaming. The very word made 
his powerful body chill. But if 
she was neglecting to take any 
of her drugs and he called in a 
medicop, it would be serious. 

Conrad went into the library 
and found the Family Pharmacy. 
He switched on a light in the 
dawn-shrunken room and let his 
heavy frame into a chair. A 
Guide to Better Understanding ot 
your Family Prescriptions, Official Edition, 2831 . The book was 
mostly Medicorps propaganda 
end almost never gave a practical suggestion. If something went 
wrong, you called a medicop. 

Conrad hunted through the 
book for the section on sleeping 
compound. It was funny, too, 
about th at name Bill . Conrad 
went over all the men of their 
acquaintance with whom Clara 
had occasional affairs or with 
whom she was friendly and he 
couldn't remember a single Bill. 
In fact, the only man with that 



name whom he could think of 
was his own hyperalter. Bill 
Walden. But that was naturally 
impossible. 

Maybe dreaming was always 
about imaginary people. 

sleeping compound: An official mixture of soporific and hypnotic alkaloids 
ami synthetics. A critical drug; an essential feature in every prescription. 
Slight deviations in following prescription are unallowable because of the 
subtle manner in which behavior may 
be altered over months or years. The 
first sleeping compound was announced 
by Thomas Marshall in 1986. The 
formula has been modified only twice 
since then. 

There followed a tightly 
packed description of the chemistry and pharmacology of the 
various ingredients. Conrad skipped through this. 

The importance of Sleeping Compound in the life of every individual 
and to society is best appreciated when 
we recall Marshall's words announcing 
its initial development: 

"It is during so-called normal sleep 
that the vicious unconscious mind responsible for wars and other symptoms 
of unhappiness develops its resources 
and its hold on our conscious lives. 

"In this normal sleep the critical 
faculties of the cortex are paralyzed. 
Meanwhile, the infantile unconscious 
mind expands misinterpreted experience into the toxic patterns of neurosis 
and psychosis. The conscious mind 
takes over at morning, unaware that 
these infantile motivations have been 
cleverly woven into its very structure.

"Sleeping Compound will stop this. I 
There 19 no unconscious activity after 
taking this harmless drug. We believe 
the Medicorps should at once initiate 
measures to acclimatize every child to 
its use. In these children, as the years 
go by. infantile patterns unable to worV 
during sleep will fight a losing, battle 
during waking hours with conscious 
patterns accumulating in the direction 
of adulthood." 

That was all there was — -mostly 
the Medicorps patting its own 
back for saving humanity. But if 
you were in trouble and called a 
medicop, you'd risk getting into 
real trouble. 

Conrad became aware of Clara 
standing in the doorway. The 
flush of her disturbed emotions 
and the pallor of her fatigue 
mixed in ragged banners on her 
cheeks. 

Conrad waved the Family 
Pharmacy with a foolish gesture 
of embarrassment. 

"Young lady, have you been 
have you been neglecting to take 
your sleeping compound?" 

Clara turned utterly pale. "I— 
I don't understand." 

"You were talking in your 
sleep." 
- "I — was?" 

She came forward so unsteadily that he helped her to a seat. 
She stared at him. He asked 
jovially, "Who is this 'Bill' you 
were so desperately involved 
with? Have you been having an 
affair I don't know about? Aren't 



my friends good enough for 
you?" 

The result of this banter was 
that she alarmingly began to cry, 
clutching her robe about her and 
dropping her blonde head on her 
knees and sobbing. 

CHILDREN cried before they 
were acclimatized to the drugs, 
but Conrad Manz had never in 
his life seen an adult cry. Though 
he had taken his morning drugs 
and certain disrupting emotions 
were already impossible, nevertheless this sight was completely 
unnerving. 

In gasps between her spbs', 
Clara was saying, "Oh, I can't go 
back to taking themf But I can't 
keep this up! I just can't!" 

"Clara, darling; I don't know 
what to say or do. I think wc 
ought to call the Medicorps." 

Intensely frightened, she rose 
and clung to htm, begging. "Oh, 
no, Conrad, that isn't necessary! 
It isn't necessary at all. I've only 
neglected to take my sleeping 
compound and it won't happen 
again. All I need is a sleeping 
compound. Please get my pharmacist* for me and it will be all 
right." 

She was so desperate to convince him that Conrad got the 
pharmacase and a glass of water 
for her only to appease the white 
face of fright. 

Within a few minutes of taking 



i a 




 



the sleeping compound, she was 
calm. As he put her back to bed, 
she laughed with a lazy indolence. 

"Oh, Conrad, you take it so 
seriously. I only needed a sleeping compound very badly and 
now I feel fine. I'll sleep all day. 
It's a rest day. isn't it? Now go 
race a rocket and stop worrying 
and thinking about calling the 
medicops."' 

But Conrad did not go rocket 
racing as he had planned. Clara 
had been asleep only a few minutes when there was a call on the 
visiophone; they wanted him at 
the office. The city of Santa Fe 
would be completely out of balance within twelve shifts if revised plans were not put into operation immediately. They were 
to start during the next five days 
while he would be out of shift. 
In order to carry on the first day 
of their next shift, he and the 
other three traffic managers he 
worked with would have to come 
down today and familiarize 
themselves with the new operations. 

There was no getting out of it. 
His rest day was spoiled. Conrad 
resented it all the more because 
Santa Fc was clear out on the 
edge of their traffic district and 
could have been revised out of 
the Mexican offices just as well. 
But those boys down there rested 
all five days of their shift. 



Conrad looked in on Clara before he left and found her asleep 
in the total suspension of proper 
drug level. The unpleasant memory of her behavior made him 
squirm, but now that the episode 
was over, it no longer worried 
him. It was typical of him that, 
things having been set straight in 
the proper manner, he did not 
think of her again until late in 
the afternoon. 

A S early as 1950. the pioneer 
communications engineer 
Norbert Wiener had pointed out 
that there might be a close parallel between disassociation of personalities and the disruption of a 
communication system. Wiener 
referred back specifically to the 
first clear description, by Morton 
Prince, of multiple personalities 
existing together in the same human body. Prince had described 
only individual cases and his observations were not altogether acceptable in Wiener's time. Nevertheless, in the schizophrenic 
society of the 29th Century, a 
major managerial problem was 
that of balancing the communicating and non-communicating 
populations in a city. 

As far as Conrad and the other 
traffic men present at the conference were concerned, Santa Fe 
was a resort and retirement area 
of 100,000 human bodies, alive 
and consuming more than they 



tErOND BEDLAM 



produced every day of the year. 
Whatever the representatives of 
the Medicorps and Communications Board worked out, it would 
mean only slight changes in the 
types of foodstuffs, entertainment 
and so forth moving into Santa 
Fe, and Conrad could have 
grasped the entire traffic change 
in ten minutes after the real problem had been settled. But, as 
usual, he and the other traffic 
men had to sit through two hours 
while small wheels from the 
Medicorps and Communications 
acted big about rebalancing a 
city. 

For them, Conrad had to admit, Santa Fe was a great deal 
more complex than 100,000 consuming, moderately producing 
human bodies. It was 200,000 human personalities, two to each 
body. Conrad wondered sometimes what they would have done 
if the three and four personality 
cases so comrrlon back in the 20th 
and 21st Centuries had been allowed to reproduce. The 200,000 
personalities in Santa Fe were 
difficult enough. 

Like all cities, Santa Fe operated in five shifts, A, B, C, D, 
and E. 

Just as it was supposed to be 
for Conrad in his city, today was 
rest day for the 20,000 hypoalters 
on D-shift in Santa Fe. Tonight 
at around 6:00 P.M. they would 
all go to shifting rooms and be 



replaced by their hyperalters, 
who had different tastes in food 
and pleasure and took different 
drugs. 

Tomorrow would be rest day 
for the hypoalters on E-shift and 
in the evening they would turn 
things over to their hyperalters. 

The next day it would be rest 
for the A-shift hyperalters and 
three days after that the D-shift 
hyperalters, including Bill Walden, would rest till evening, when 
Conrad and the D-shift hypoalters everywhere would again 
have their five day use of their 
bodies. 

Right now the trouble with 
Santa Fe's retired population, 
which worked only for its own 
maintenance, was that too many 
elderly people on the D-shift and 
E-shift had been dying off. This 
point was brought out by a dapper young department head from 
Communications. 

Conrad groaned when, as he 
knew would happen, a Medicorps 
officer promptly set out on an 
exhaustive demonstration that 
Medicorps predictions of deaths 
for Santa Fe had indicated clearly 
that Communications should 
have been moving people from 
D-shift and E-shift into the area. 

Actually, it appeared that 
someone from Communications 
had blundered and had overloaded the quota of people on 
A-shift and B-shift moving to 



14 




 



Santa Fe. Thus on one rest -day 
there weren't enough people 
Working to keep things going, and 
later in the week there were so 
many available workers that they 
were clogging the city. 

None of this was heated exchange or in any way emotional. 
It was just interminably, exhaustively logical and boring. Conrad 
fidgeted through two hours of it, 
seeing his chance for a rocket race 
dissolving. When at last the problem of balanced shift-populations 
for Santa Fe was worked out, it 
took him and the other traffic 
men only a few minutes to apply 
their tables and reschedule traffic 
to coordinate with the population 
changes. 

Disgusted, Conrad walked over 
to the Tennis Club and had 
lunch. 

There were still two hours of 
his rest day left when Conrad 
Manz realized that Bill Walden 
was again forcing an early shift. 
Conrad was in the middle of a 
volley-tennis game and he didn't 
like having the shift forced so 
soon. People generally shifted at 
their appointed regular hour 
every five days, and a hyperaltcr 
was not supposed to use his 
power to force shift. It was such 
an unthinkable thing nowadays 
that there was occasional talk 
of abolishing the terms hyperalter 
and hypoalter because they were 
somewhat disparaging to the hy


poalter, and really designated 
only the antisocial power of the 
hyperalter to force the shift. 

Bill Walden had been cheating 
two to four hours on Conrad 
every shift for several periods 
back. Conrad could have reported 
it to the Mcdicorps, but he himself was guilty of a constant misdemeanor about which Bill had 
not yet complained. Unlike the 
sedentary Walden, Conrad Manz 1 
enjoyed exercise. He overindulged 
in violent sports and put off sleep, 
letting Bill Walden make up the 
fatigue on his shift. That was 
undoubtedly why the poor old 
sucker had started cheating a few 
hours on Conrad's rest day. 

Conrad laughed to himself, remembering the time Bill Walden 
had registered a long list of sports 
which he wished Conrad to be 
restrained from — rocket racing, 
deepsea exploration, jet-skiing. It 
had only given Conrad some 
ideas he hadn't had before. The 
Medicorps had refused to enforce 
the list on the basis that danger 
and violent exercise were a necessary outlet for Conrad's constitution. Then poor old Bill had written Conrad a note threatening to 
sue him for any injury resulting 
from such sports. As if he had 
a change against the Medicorps 
ruling! 

Conrad knew it was no use trying to finish the volley-tennis 
game. He lost interest and 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



I* 



couldn't concentrate on what he 
was doing when Bill started forcing the shift, Conrad shot the 
ball back at his opponent in a 
blistering curve impossible to intercept. 

'So long," he yelled at the man. 
"I've got some things to do before 
my shift ends." 

He lounged into the locker 
rooms and showered, put his 
clothes and belongings, including his pharmacase, in a shipping 
carton, addressed them to his own 
home and dropped them in the 
mail chute. 

He stepped with languid 
nakedness across the hall, pressed 
his identifying wristband to a 
lock-face and dialed his clothing 
sizes. 

In this way he procured a 
neatly wrapped, clean shifting 
costume from the slot. He put it 
on without bothering to return 
to his shower room. 

He shouted a loud good-bye to 
no one in particular among the 
several men and women in the 
baths and stepped out onto the 
Street. 

Conrad felt too good even to 
be sorry that his shift was over. 
After all, nothing happened except you came to, five days later, 
on your next shift. The important 
thing was the rest day. He had 
always said the last day of the 
shift should be a work day; then 
you would be glad it was over. 



He guessed the idea was to rest 
the body before another personality took over. Well, poor old 
Bill Walden never got a rested 
body. He probably slept off the 
first twelve hours. 

Walking unhurriedly through 
the street crowds, Conrad entered a public shifting station and 
found an empty room. ' As he 
started to open the door, a girl 
came out of the adjoining booth 
and Conrad hastily averted his 
glance. She was still rearranging 
her hair. There were so many rude 
people nowadays who didn't seem 
to care at all about the etiquette 
of shifting, women particularly. 
They were always redoing their 
hair or makeup where a person 
couldn't help seeing them. 

Conrad pressed his identifying 
wristband to the lock and entered 
the booth he had picked. The act 
automatically sent the time and 
his shift number to Medicorps 
Headquarters. 

Once inside the shifting room, 
Conrad went to the lavatory and 
turned on the faucet of makeup 
solvent. In spite of losing two 
hours of his rest day, he decided 
to be decent to old Bill, though 
he was half tempted to leave his 
makeup on. It was a pretty foul 
joke, of course, especially on a 
humorless fellow like poor Walden. 

Conrad creamed his face thoroughly and then washed in water 



16 




 



and used the automatic dryer. 
He looked at his strong-lined features in the mirror. They displayed a less distinct expression 
of his own personality with the 
makeup gone. 

He turned away from the mirror and it was only then that he 
remembered he hadn't spoken to 
his wife before shifting. Well, he 
couldn't decently call up and let 
her see him without makeup. 

He stepped across to the visiophone and set the machine to 
deliver his spoken message in 
type: "Hello, Clara. Sorry I forgot to call you before. Bill Walden is forcing me to shift early 
again. I hope you're not still upset about that business this morning. Be a good girl and smile at 
me on the next shift. I love you. 
Conrad." 

"pOR a moment, when the shift 
* came, the body of Conrad 
Manz stood moronically uninhabited. Then, rapidly, out of the 
gyri of its brain, the personality 
of Bill Walden emerged, replacing 
the slackly powerful attitude of 
Conrad by the slightly prim preciseness of Bill's bearing. 

The face, just now relaxed with 
readiness for action, was abruptly 
pulled into an intellectualized 
mask of tension by habitual patterns of conflict in the muscles. 
There were also acute momentary 
signs of clash between the vegeta


tive nervous activity characteristic of Bill Walden and the internal homeostasis Conrad Manz 
had left behind him. The face 
paled as hypersensitive vascular 
beds closed down under new 
vegetative volleys. 

Bill Walden grasped sight and 
sound, and the sharp odor of 
makeup solvent stung his nostrils. He was conscious of only 
one clamoring, terrifying thought : 
They will catch us. It cannot go 
on much longer without Helen 
guessing about Clara. She is already angry about Clara delaying 
the shift, and if she learns from 
Mary that I am cheating on Con~ 
rad's shift . . . Any time now, 
perhaps this time, when the shift 
is over. I will be looking into the 
face of a medicop who is pulling 
a needle from my arm, and then 
it'll all be over. 

So far, at least, there was no 
medicop. Still feeling unreal but 
anxious not to lose precious moments. Bill took an individualized kit from the wall dispenser 
and made himself up. He was 
sparing and subtle in his use of 
the makeup, unlike the horrible 
makeup jobs Conrad Manz occasionally left on. Bill rearranged 
his hair. Conrad always wore it 
too short for his taste, but you 
couldn't complain about everything. 

Bill sat in a chair to await some 
of the slower aspects of the shift.

He knew that an hour after he 
left the booth, his basal metabolic 
rate would be ten points higher. 
His blood sugar would go down 
steadily. In the next five days he 
would lose six to eight pounds, 
which Conrad later would 
promptly regain. 

Just as Bill was about to leave 
the booth, he remembered to pick 
up a news summary. He put his 
wristband to the switch on the 
telephoto and a freshly printed 
summary of the last five days in 
the world fell into the rack. His 
wristband, of course, called forth 
one edited for hyperalters on the 
D-shift. 

It did not mention by name 
any hypoalter on the D-shift. 
Should one of them have done 
something that it was necessary 
for Bill or other D-shift hyperalters to know about, it would 
appear in news summaries called 
forth by their wristbands — but 
told in such fashion that the personality involved seemed namelessly incidental, while names and 
pictures of hyperalters and hypoalters on any of the other four 
shifts naturally were freely used. 
The purpose was to keep Conrad 
Manz and all other hypoalters 
on the D-shift. one-tenth of the 
total population, non-existent as 
far as their hyperalters were concerned. This convention made it 
necessary for photoprint summaries to be on light-sensitive 



paper that blackened illegibly before six hours were up, so that a 
man might never stumble on news 
about his hypoalter. 

Bill did not even glance at the 
news summary. He had picked it 
up only for appearances. The 
summaries were essential if you 
were going to start where you left 
off on your last shift and have 
any knowledge of the five intervening days. A man just didn't 
walk out of a shifting room without one. It was failure to do little things like that that would 
start them wondering about him. 

Bill opened the door of the 
booth by applying his wristband 
to the lock and stepped out into 
the street. 

Late afternoon crowds pressed 
about him. Across the boulevard, 
a helicopter landing swarmed 
with clouds of rising commuters. 
Bill had some trouble figuring 
out the part of the city Conrad 
had left him in and walked two 
blocks before he understood 
where he was. Then he got into 
an idle two-place cab, started 
the motor with his wristband and 
hurried the little three-wheeler 
recklessly through the traffic. 
Clara was probably already waiting and he first had to go home 
and get dressed. 

The thought of Clara waiting 
for him in the park near her home 
was a sharp reminder of his 
strange situation. He was in a

left you with shame, and a fear 
that the other fellow would tell 
people you seemed to have a 
pathological interest in your alter 
and must need a change in your 
prescription. 

But the most flagrant abuser 
of such morbid little exchanges 
would have been horrified to learn 
that right here, in the middle of 
the daylight traffic, was a man 
who was using his antisocial shifting power to meet in secret the 
wife of his own hypoalter! 

Bill did not have to wonder 
what the Medicorps would think. 
Relations between hyperalters 
world that was literally not supposed to exist for him, for it was 
the world of his own hypoalter, 
Conrad Manz. 

Undoubtedly, there were people in the traffic up ahead who 
knew both him and Conrad, people from the other shifts who 
never mentioned the one to the 
other except in those guarded, 
snickering little confidences they 
couldn't resist tell ing and you 
couldn't resist listening to. After 
all, the most important person in 
the world was your alter. If he 
got sick, injured or killed, so 
would you. 

Thus, in moments of intimacy 
or joviality, an undercover exchange went on . . . Ill tell you 
about your hyperalter if you*// 
tell me about my hypoalter. It 
was orthodox bad manners that 



and hypoalters of opposite sex 
were punishable — drastically 
punishable. 

WHEN he arrived at the apartment. Bill remembered to 
order a dinner for his daughter 
Mary. His order, dialed from the 
day's menu, was delivered to the 
apartment pneumatically and he 
set it out over electric warmers. 
He wanted to write a note to the 
child, but he ' started two and 
threw both in the basket. He 
couldn't think of anything to say 
to her. 

Staring at the lonely tabic he 
was leaving for Mary. Bill felt 
his guilt overwhelming him. He 
could stop the behavior which 
led to the guilt by taking his 
drugs as prescribed. They would 
return him immediately to the 
sane and ordered conformity of 
the world. He would no longer 
have to carry the fear that the 
Medicorps would discover he was 
not taking his drugs. He would 
no longer neglect his appointed 
child. He would no longer endanger the very life of Conrad's 
wife Clara and, of course, his 
own. 

When you took your drugs as 
prescribed, it was impossible to 
experience such ancient and 
primitive emotions as guilt. Even 
should you miscalculate and do 
something wrong, the drug* 
would not allow any such emo


BEYOND IE01AM 



1* 



tional reaction. To be free to experience his guilt over the lonely 
child who needed him was, for 
these reasons, a precious thing 
to Bill. In all the world, this 
night, he was undoubtedly the 
only man who could and did feci 
one of the ancient emotions. People felt shame, not guilt; conceit, not pride; pleasure, not desire. Now that he had stopped 
taking his dugs as prescribed. Bill 
realized that the drugs allowed 
only an impoverished segment of 
a vivid emotional spectrum. 

But however exciting it was to 
live them, the ancient emotions 
did not seem to act as deterrents 
to bad behavior. Bill's sense of 
guilt did not keep him from continuing to neglect Mary. His fear 
of being caught did not restrain 
him from breaking every rule of 
inter-alter law and loving Clara, 
his own hypoalter's wife. 

BILL got dressed as rapidly as 
possible. He tossed the discarded shifting costume into the 
return chute. He retouched his 
makeup, trying to eliminate some 
of the heavy, inexpressive planes 
of muscularity which were more 
typical of Conrad than of himself. 

The act reminded him of the 
shame which his wife Helen had 
felt when she learned, a few years 
ago, that her own hypoalter, 
Clara, and his hypoalter, Con


rad, had obtained from the Medicorps a special release to marry. 
Such rare marriages in which the 
same bodies lived together on 
both halves of a shift were something to snicker about. They 
veTgetl on the antisocial, but 
could be arranged if the batteries 
of Medicorps tests could be satisfied. 

Perhaps it had been the very 
intensity of Helen's shame on 
learning of this marriage, the 
nauseous display of conformity 
so typical of his wife, that had 
first given Bill the idea of seeking 
out Clara, who had dared convention to make such a peculiar 
marriage. Over the years, Helen 
had continued blaming all their 
troubles on the fact that both 
egos of himself were living with, 
and intimate with, both egos of 
herself. 

So Bill had started cutting 
down on his drugs, the curiosity 
having become an obsession. 
What was this other part of Helea 
like, this Clara who was unconventional enough to want to 
marry only Bill's own hypoalter, 
in spite of almost certain public 
shame? 

He had first seen Clara's face 
when it formed on a visiophone, 
the first time he had forced Conrad to shift prematurely. It was 
softer than Helen's. The delicate 
contours were less purposefully, 
set, gayer. 




 



"Clara Manz?" Bill had sat 
there staring at the visiophone for 
several seconds, unable to continue. His great fear that she 
would immediately report him 
must have been naked on his face. 

He had watched an impish suspicion grow in the tender curve of 
her lips and her oblique glance 
from the visiophone. She did not 
speak. 

"Mrs. Manz," he finally said, 
"I would like to meet you in the 
park across from your home." 

To this awkward opening he 
owed the first time he had heard 
Clara laugh. Her warm, clear 
laughter, teasing him, tumbled 
forth like a cloud of gay butterflies. 

*'Are you afraid to -see me here 
at home because my husband 
might walk in on us?" 

Bill had been put completely 
at ease by this bantering indication that Clara knew who he was 
and welcomed him as an intriguing diversion. Quite literally, the 
one person who could not walk 
in on them, as the ancients 
■ thought of it. was his own hypoalter, Conrad Manz. 

T> I IX finished retouching his 
makeup and hurried to leave 
the apartment. But this time, as 
he passed the table where Mary's 
dinner was set out, he decided to 
write a few words to the child, 
no matter how empty they 



sounded to himself. The note he 
left explained that he had some 
early work to do at the microfilm 
library where he worked. 

Just as Bill was leaving the 
apartment, the visiophone buzzed. 
In his hurry Bill flipped the 
switch before he thought. Too 
late, his hand froze and the implications of this call, an hour 
before anyone would normally 
be home, shot a shaft of terror 
through him. 

But it was not the image of a 
medicop that formed on the 
screen. The woman introduced 
herself as Mrs. Harris, one of 
Mary's teachers. 

It was strange that she should 
have thought he might be home. 
The shift for children was half a 
day earlier than that for adults, 
so the parents could have halt 
their rest day free. This afternoon 
would be for Mary the first 
classes of her shift, but the 
teacher must have guessed something was wrong with the shifting 
schedules in Mary's family. Of 
had the child told her? 

Mrs. Harris explained rather 
dramatically that Mary was being neglected. What could he say 
to her? That he was a criminal 
breaking drug regulations in the 
most flagrant manner? That 
nothing, not even the child appointed to him, meant more W 
him than his wife's own hypoalter? Bill finally ended the hope


BCrO NO BEDLAM 



less and possibly dangerous conversation by turning off the receiver and leaving the apartment. 

Bill realized that now, for both 
him and Clara, the greatest joy 
had been those first few times 
together. The enormous threat of 
a Medicorps retaliation took the 
pleasure from their contact and 
they came together desperately 
"because, having tasted this fantastic non- conformity and the 
new undrugged intimacy, there 
was no other way for them. Even 
now as he drove through the traffic toward where she would be 
waiting, he was not so much concerned with meeting Clara in 
their fear-poisoned present as 
with the vivid, aching remembrance of what those meetings 
once had really been like. 

He recalled an evening they 
had spent lying on the summer 
lawn of the park, looking out at 
the haze-dimmed stars. It had 
been shortly after Clara joined 
him in cutting down on the drugs, 
and the clear memory of their 
quiet laughter so captured his 
mind now that Bill almost tangled his car in the traffic. 

In memory he kissed her again 
and, as it had then, the newly cur 
grass mixed with the exciting 1 
fragrance of her skin. After the 
kiss they continued a mock discussion of the ancient word "sin." 
Bill pretended to be trying to explain the meaning of the word to 



her, sometimes with definitions 
that kept them laughing and 
sometimes with demonstrational 
kisses that stopped their laughter. 

He could remember Clara's 
face turned to him in the evening 
light with an outrageous parody 
of interest. He could hear himself saying, "You see, the ancients 
would say we are not sinning 
because they would disagree with 
the medicops that you and Helen 
are two completely different people, or that Conrad and I are not 
the same person." 

Clara kissed him with an 
air of tentative experimentation. 
"Mmm, no. I can't say I care for 
fhat interpretation." 

"You'd rather be sinning?" 

"Definitely." 

"Well, if the ancients did agree 
with the medicops that we are 
distinct from our alters, Helen 
and Conrad, then they would say 
we are sinning — but not for the 
same reasons the Medicorps 
would give." 

"That," asserted Clara, "is 
where I get lost. If this sinning 
business is going to be worth anything at all, it has to be something you can identify." 

Bill cut his car out of the main 
stream of traffic and toward the 
park, without interrupting his 
memory. 

"Well, darling, I don't want to 
confuse you, but the medicops 



72 




 



would say we arc sinning only 
because you are my wife's hypoalter, and I am your husband's 
hyperalter — in other words, for 
the very reason the ancients 
would say we are nor sinning. 
Furthermore, if either of us were 
with anyone else, the medicops 
would think it was perfectly all 
right, and so would Conrad and 
Helen. Provided, of course, I took 
a hyperalter and you took a hypoalter only." 

"Of course," Clara said, and 
Bill hurried over the gloomy fact. 

"The ancients, on the other 
hand, would say we are sinning 
because we are making love to 
someone we are not married to." 

"But what's the matter with 
that? Everybody does it." 

"The ancient Moderns didn't. 
Or, that is, they often did, but..." 

Clara brought her full lips 
hungrily to his. "Darling, I think 
the ancient Moderns had the right 
idea, though I don't see how they 
ever arrived at it." 

Bill grinned. "It was just an 
invention of theirs, along with the 
wheel and atomic energy." 

That evening was long gone by 
as Bill stopped the little taxi beside the park and left it there for 
the next user. He walked across 
the lawns toward the statue 
where he and Clara always met. 
The very thought of entering 
one's own hypoalter's house was 
so unnerving that Bill brought 

BEYOND BEDLAM 



himself to do it only by first 
meeting Clara near the statue. As 
he walked between the trees. Bill 
could not again capture the spirit 
of that evening he had been remembering. The Medicorps was 
too close. It was impossible to 
laugh that way now. 

Bill arrived at the statue, but 
Clara was not there. He waited 
impatiently while a livid sunset 
coagulated between the branches 
of the great trees. Clara should 
have been there first. It was easier 
for her, because she was leaving 
her shift, and without doing it 
prematurely. 

The park was like a quiet 
backwater in the eddying rush of 
the evening city. Bill felt conspicuous and vulnerable in the 
gloaming light. Above all, he felt 
a' new loneliness, and he knew 
that now Clara felt it, too. They 
needed each other as each had 
been, before fear had bleached 
their feeling to white bones of 
desperation. 

They were not taking their 
drugs as prescribed, and for that 
they would be horribly punished. 
That was the only unforgivable 
sin in their world. By committing 
it, he and Clara had found out 
,what life could be, in the same 
act that would surely take life 
from them. Their powerful emotions they had found in abundance simply by refusing to take 
the drugs, and by being together 

23 



briefly each fifth day in a dangerous breach of all convention. 
The closer their discovery and 
the greater their terror, the more 
desperately they needed even 
their terror, and the more impossible became the delight of their 
first meetings. 

Telegraphing bright beads of 
sound, a night bird skimmed the 
sunset lawns to the looming 
statue and skewed around its 
monolithic base. The bird's piping doubled and then choked off 
as it veered frantically from Bill. 
After a while, far off through the 
park, it released a fading protest 
of song. 

Above Bill, the towering statue 
of the great Alfred Morris blackened against the sunset. The hollowed granite eyes bore down on 
him out of an undecipherable dark 
. . . the ancient, implacable face 
of the Medicorps. As if to pronounce a sentence on his present 
crimes by a magical disclosure of 
the weight of centuries, a pool of 
sulfurous light and leaf shadows 
danced on the painted plaque 
at the base of the statue. 

On this spot in the Gregorian year 
1996, Alfred Morris announced to an 
assembly of war survivors the hypothalamic block. His stirring words were, 
"This new drug selectively halts at 
the thalamic brain the upward flow of 
unconscious stimuli and the downward 
flow of unconscious motivations. It 
acts as a screen between the cerebrum 
and the psychosomatic discharge sys


tem. Using hypothalamic block, we will 
not act emotively, we will initiate acts 
only from the logical demands of situations." 

This announcement and the subsequent wholehearted action of the warweary people made the taking of hypothalamic block obligatory. This put an 
end to the powerful play of unconscious mind in the public and private 
affairs of the ancient world. It ended 
the great paranoid wars and saved 
mankind. 

In the strange evening light, 
the letters seemed alive, a centuries-old condemnation of any 
who might try to go back to the 
ancient pre-pharmacy days. Of 
course, it was not really possible 
to go back. Without drugs, everybody and all society would fall 
apart. 

The ancients had first learned 
to keep endocrine deviates such 
as the diabetic alive with drugs. 
Later they learned with other 
drugs to "cure" the far more 
prevalent disease, schizophrenia, 
that was jamming their hospitals. 
The big change came when the 
ancients used these same drugs 
on everyone to control the private 
and public irrationality of their 
time and stop the wars. 

In this new, drugged world, the 
schizophrene thrived better than 
any, and the world became patterned on him. But, just as the 
diabetic was still diabetic, the 
schizophrene was still himself, 
plus the drugs. Meanwhile, every

one had forgotten what it was the 
drugs did to you — that the emotions experienced were blurred 
emotions, that insight was at an 
isolated level of rationality because the drugs kept true feelings 
from ever emerging. 

How inconceivable it would be 
to Helen and the other people of 
his world to live on as little drug 
as possible ... to experience the 
conflicting emotions, the interplay of passion and logic that 
almost tore you apart! Sober, the 
ancients called it, and they lived 
that way most of the time, with 
only the occasional crude and 
clublike effects of alcohol or narcotics to relieve their chronic 
anxiety. 

By taking as little hypothalamic block as possible, he and 
Clara were able to desire their 
fantastic attachment, to delight 
in an absolutely illogical situation unheard of in their society. 
But the society would judge their 
refusal to take hypothalamic 
block in only one sense. The 
weight of this judgment stood 
before him in the smoldering 
words, "It ended the great paranoid wars and saved mankind." 

When Clara did appear, she 
was searching myopically in the 
wrong vicinity of the statue. He 
did not call to her at once, letting 
the sight of her smooth out the 
tensions in him, convert all the 
conflicts into this one intense 



longing to be with her. 

Her halting search for him was 
deeply touching, like that of • 
tragic little puppet in a darkening dumbshow. He saw suddenly 
how like puppets the two of them 
were. They were moved by the 
strengthening wires of a new life 
of feeling to batter clumsily at an 
implacable stage setting that 
would finally leave them as bits 
of wood and paper. 

Then suddenly in his arms 
Clara was at the same time 
hungrily moving and tense with 
fear of discovery. Little sounds 
of love and fear choked each other 
in her throat. Her blonde head 
pressed tightly into his shoulder 
and she clung to him with desperation. 

She said, "Conrad was disturbed by my tension this morning and made me take a sleeping 
compound. I've just awakened." 

They walked *o her home in 
silence and even in the darkened 
apartment they used only the 
primiti ve monosyllables of apprehensive need. Beyond these 
mere sounds of compassion, they 
had long ago said all that could 
be said. 

Because Bill was the hyperalter, he had no fear that Conrad 
could force a shift on him. When 
later they lay in darkness, he 
allowed himself to drift into a 
brief slumber. Without the sleeping compound, distorted event*

came and went without reason. 
Dreaming, the ancients had called 
it. It was one of the most frightening things that had begun to 
happen when he first cut down 
on the drugs. Now, in the few 
seconds that he dozed, a thou'sand fragments of incidental 
knowledge, historical reading and 
emotional need melded and, in a 
strange contrast to their present 
tranquility, he was dreaming a 
frightful moment in the 20th 
century. These are the great paranoid wars, he thought. And it was 
so because he had thought it. 

He searched frantically through 
the glove compartment of an ancient automobile. "Wait," he 
pleaded. "I tell you we have sulfonamide- 14. We've been taking 
it regularly as directed. We took 
a double dose back in Paterson 
because there were soft-bombs 
all through that part of Jersey 
and we didn't know what would 
be declared Plague Area next." 

Now Bill threw things out of 
his satchel onto the floor and seat 
of the car. fumbling deeper by 
the flashlight Clara held. His 
heart beat thickly with terror. 
Then he remembered his pharmacasc. Oh, why hadn't they remembered sooner about their 
pharmacases. Bill tore at the belt 
about his waist. 

The Medi corps captain stepped 
back from the door of their car. 
He jerked his head at the dark 



form of the corporal standing in 
the roadway. "Shoot them. Run 
the car off the embankment before you burn it." 

Bill screamed metallically 
through the speaker of his radiation mask. "Wait. I've found it." 
He thrust the pharmacase out the 
door of the car. "This is a pharmacase." he explained. "We keep 
our drugs in one of these and it's 
belted to our waist so we are 
never without them." 

The captain of the Medicorps 
came back. He inspected the 
pharmacase and the drugs and 
returned it. "From now on, keep 
your drugs handy. Take them 
without fail according to radio 
instructions. Do you understand?" 

Clara's head pressed heavily 
against Bill's shoulder, and he 
could hear the tinny sound of her 
sobbing through the speaker of 
her mask. 

The captain stepped into the 
road again. "We'll have to burn 
your car. You passed through a 
Plague Area and it can't be sterilized on this route. About a mile 
up this road you'll come to a 
sterilization unit. Stop and have 
your person and belongings 
rayed. After that, keep walking, 
but stick to the road, You'll be 
shot if you're- caught off it." 

The road was crowded with 
fleeing people. Their way was 
lighted by piles of cadavers 




 



writhing in gasoline flames. The 
Medicorps was everywhere. Those 
who stumbled, those who coughed, the delirious and their helping partners . . . these were taken 
to the side of the road, shot and 
burned. And there was bombing 
again to the south. 

Bill stopped in the middle of 
the road and looked back. Clara 
clung to him. 

"There is a plague here we 
haven't any drug for," he said, 
and realized he was crying. "We 
are all mad." 

Clara was crying too. "Darling, 
what have you done? Where are 
the drugs?" 

The water of the Hudson hung 
as it had in the late afternoon, 
ice crystals in the stratosphere. 
The high, high sheet flashed and 
glowed in the new bombing to the 
south, where multicolored pillars 
of flame boiled into the sky. But 
the muffled crash of the distant 
bombing was suddenly the steady 
click of the urgent signal on a 
bedside visiophone, and Bill was 
abruptly awake. 

Clara was throwing on her robe 
and moving toward the machine 
on terror -rigid limbs. With a 
scrambling motion, Bill got out 
of the possible view of the machine and crouched at the end of 
the room. * 

Distinctly, he could hear the 
machine say. "Clara Manz?" 

"Yes." Clara's voice was a thin 



treble that could have been a 
shriek had it continued. 

"This is Medicorps Headquarters. A routine check discloses 
you have delayed your shift two 
hours. To maintain the statistical 
record of deviations, please give 
us a full explanation." 

"I . . ." Clara had to swallow 
before she could talk. "I must 
have taken too much sleeping 
compound." 

"Mrs. Manz, our records indicate that you have been delaying 
your shift consistently for several 
periods now. We made a check 
of this as a routine follow up on 
any such deviation, but the discovery is quite serious." There 
was a harsh silence, a silence that 
demanded a logical answer. But 
how could there be a logical answer? 

"My hyperalter hasn't complained and I — well, I have just 
let a bad habit develop. I'll see 
that it — doesn't happen again." 

The machine voiced several 
platitudes about the responsibilities of one personality to another 
and the duty of all to society before Clara was able to shut it off. 

Both of them sat as they were 
for a long, long time while the 
tide of terror subsided. When at 
last they looked at each other 5 ' 
across the dim and silent room, 
both of them knew there tould 
be at least one more time together 
before they were caught.

FIVE days later, on the Inst day 
of her shift, Mary Walden 
wrote the address of her appointed father's hypoalter, Conrad Manz, with an indelible 
pencil on the skin just below' her 
armpit. 

During the morning, her father 
and mother had spoiled the family rest day by quarreling. It was 
about Helen's hypoalter delaying 
so many^shifts. Bill did not think 
it very important, but her mother 
was angry and threatened to 
complain to the Medicorps. 

The lunch was eaten in silence, 
except that at one point Bill 
said, "It seems to me Conrad 
and Clara Manz are guilty of a 
peculiar marriage, not us. Yet 
they seem perfectly happy with 
it and you're the one who is made 
unhappy. The woman has probably just developed a habit of 
taking too much sleeping compound for her rest day naps. Why 
don't you drop her a note?" 

Helen made only one remark. 
It was said through her teeth and 
very softly. "Bill, I would just as 
soon the child did not realize her 
i < lationship to this sordid situation." 

Mary cringed over the way 
Helen disregarded her hearing, 
the possibility that she might be 
capable of understanding, or her 
feelings about being shut out of 
their mutual world. 

After the lunch Mary cleared 



the table, throwing the remains 
of the meal and the plastiplates 
into the flash trash disposer. Her 
father had retreated to the library 
room and Helen was getting 
ready to attend a Citizen's Meeting. Mary heard her mother enter the room to say good bye 
while she was wiping the dining 
table. She knew that Helen was 
standing, well-dressed and a little impatient, just behind her, but 
she pretended she did not know. 

"Darling, I'm leaving now for 
the Citizen's Meeting." 

""Oh . . . yes." 

"Be a good girl and don't be 
late for your shift. You only have 
an hour now." Helen's patrician 
face smiled. 

"I won't be late." 

"Don't pay any attention to 
the things Bill and I discussed 
this morning, will you?" 

"No." 

And she was gone. She did not 
say good-bye to Bill. 

Mary was very conscious of her 
father in the house. He continued 
to sit in the library. She walked 
by the door and she could see 
him sitting in a chair, staring at 
the floor. Mary stood in the sun 
room for a long while. If he had 
risen from his chair, if he had 
rustled a page, if he had sighed, 
she would have heard him. 

It grew closer and closer to the 
time she would have to leave if 
Susan Shorrs was to catch the 



IEYOND IEDIAM 



2? 



first school hours of her shift. 
Why did children have to shift 
half a day before adults? 

Finally, Mary thought of something to say. She could let him 
know she was old enough to understand what the quarrel had 
been about if only it were explained to her. 

Mary went into the library and 
hesitantly sat on the edge of a 
couch near him. He did not look 
at her and his face seemed gray 
in the midday light. Then she 
knew that he was lonely, too. But 
a great feeling of tenderness for 
him went through her. 

"Sometimes I think you and 
Clara Manz must be the only 
people in the world," she said 
abruptly, "who aren't so silly 
about shifting right on the dot. 
Why, I don't care if Susan Shorrs 
is an hour late for classes!" 

Those first moments when- he 
seized her in his arms, it seemed 
her heart would shake loose. It 
was as though she had uttered 
some magic formula, one that 
had abruptly opened the doors 
to his love. It was only after he 
had explained to her why he was 
always late on the first day of the 
family shift that she knewsomething was wrong. He did tell her, 
over and over, that he knew she 
was unhappy and that it was his 
fault. But he was at the same 
time soothing her, petting her, as 
if he was afraid oi her. 



He talked on and on. Gradually, Mary understood in his 
trembling body, in his perspiring 
palms, in his pleading eyes, that 
he was afraid of dying, that he 
was afraid she would kill him 
with the merest thing she said, 
with her very presence. 

This was not painful to Mary, 
because, suddenly, something 
came with ponderous enormity to 
stand before her: / would just as 
soon the child did not realize her 
relationship to this sordid situa~ 
Hon, 

Her relationship. It was some 
kind of relationship to Conrad 
and Clara Manz. because those 
were the people they had been 
talking about. 

The moment her father left the 
apartment, she went to his desk 
and took out the file of family 
records. After she found the address of Conrad Manz, the idea 
occurred to her to write it on her 
body. Mary was certain that 
Susan Shorrs never bathed and 
she thought this a clever idea. 
Sometime on Susan's rest day, 
five days from now, she would 
try to force the shift and go to 
see Conrad and Clara Manz. Her 
plan was simple in execution, but 
totally vague as to goal. 

Mary was already late when 
she hurried to the children's section of a public shifting Station. 
A Children's Transfer Bus was 
waiting, and Mary registered on 



30 




 



it for Susan Sliorrs to be taken 
to school. After that she found 
a shifting room and opened it 
with her wristband. She changed 
into a shifting costume and sent 
her own clothes and belongings 
home v 

Children her age did not wear 
makeup, but Mary always stood 
at the mirror during the shift. 
She always tried as hard as she 
could to see what Susan Shorrs 
looked like. She giggled over a 
verse that was scrawled beside 
the mirror . . . 

Rouge your hair and comb yotir 

face; 

Many a third head is lost in this 
place. 

. . . and then the shift came, 
doubly frightening because of 
what she knew she was going to 
do. 

"■^SPECIALLY if you were a 
**-^ hyperalter like Mary, you 
were supposed to have some sense 
of the passage of time while you 
were out of shift. Of course, you 
flid not know what was going on. 
but it was as though a more or 
less accurate chronometer kept 
running when you went out of 
shift. Apparently Mary's was 
highly inaccurate, because, to her 
horror, she found herself sitting 
bolt upright in one of Mrs. Harris's classes, not out on the play


grounds, where she had expected 
Susan Schorrs to be. 

Mary was terrified, and the 
ugly school dress Susan had been 
wearing accented, by its strangeness, the seriousness of her premature shift. Children weren't 
supposed to show much difference 
from hyperalter to. hypoalter, but 
when she raised her eyes, her 
fright grew. Children did change. 
She hardly recognized anyone in 
the room, though most of them 
must be the alters of her own 
classmates. Mrs. Harris was a 
B-shift and overlapped both 
Mary and Susan, but otherwise 
Mary recognized only Carl 
Blair's hypoalter because of his 
freckles. 

Mary knew she had to get out 
of there or Mrs. Harris would 
eventually recognize her. If she 
left the room quietly, Mrs. Harris would not question her unless 
she recognized her. It was no use 
trying to guess how Susan would 
walk. 

Mary stood and went toward 
the door, glad that it turned her 
back to Mrs. Harris. It seemed 
to her that she could feel the 
teacher's eyes stabbing through 
her back. 

But she walked safely from 
the room. She dashed down the 
school corridor and out into the 
street. So great was her fear of 
what she was doing that her hypoalter's world actually seemed 



iEYOND B EDI AM 



31 



like a different one. 

It was a long way for Mary to 
walk across town, and when she 
rang the bell, Conrad Manz was 
already home from work.' He 
smiled at her and she loved him 
at once. 

"Well, what do you want, 
young lady?" he asked. 

Mary couldn't answer him. She 
just smiled back. 

"What's your name, eh?" 

Mary went right on smiling, 
but suddenly he blurred in front 
of her. 

"Here, here! There's nothing to 
cry about. Come on in and let's 
see if we can help you. Clara! We 
have a visitor, a very sentimental 
visitor." 

Mary let him put his big arm 
around her shoulder and draw 
her, crying, into the apartment. 
Then she saw Clara swimming 
before her, looking like her 
iiiother, but . . . no, not at all 
like her mother. 

"Now, see here, chicken, what 
is it you've come for?" Conrad 
asked when her crying stopped. 

Mary had to stare hard at the 
floor to be able to say it. "I want 
to live with you." 

Clara was twisting and untwisting a handkerchief. "But, 
child, we have already had our 
first baby appointed to us. He'll 
be with us next shift, and after 
that I have to bear a baby for 
someone else to keep. We 

32 



wouldn't be allowed to take care 
of you." 

"I thought maybe I was your 
real child." Mary said it helplessly, knowing in advance what 
the answer would be. 

"Darling," Clara soothed, "children don't live with their natural 
parents. It's neither practical nor 
civilized. I have had a child conceived and borne on my shift, and 
this baby is my exchange, so you 
see that you are much too old to 
be my conception. Whoever your 
natural parents may be, it is just 
something on record with the 
Medicorps Genetic Division and 
isn't important." 

"But you're a special case," 
Mary pressed. "I thought because 
it was a special arrangement that 
you were my real parents." She 
looked up and she saw that Clara 
had turned white. 

And now Conrad Manz was 
agitated, too. "What do you 
mean, we're a special case?" He 
was staring hard at her. 

"Because . . ." And now for the 
first time Mary realized how special this case was, how sensitive 
they would be about it. 

He grasped her by the shoulders and turned her so she faced 
his unblinking eyes. "I said, what 
do you mean, we're a special 
case? Clara, what in thirty heads 
does this kid mean?" 

His grip hurt her and she began to cry again. She broke away. 

5ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"You're the hypoalters of my appointed father and mother. I 
thought maybe when it was like 
that, I might be your real child 
. . . and you might want me. I 
don't want to be where I am. I 
want somebody . . ." 

Clara was calm now, her sudden fear gone. "But, darling, if 
you're unhappy where you are, 
only the Medieorps can reappoint you. Besides, maybe your 
appointed parents are just having 
some personal problems right 
now. Maybe if you tried to understand them, you would see 
that they really love you." 

Conrad's face showed that he 
did not understand. He spoke 
with a stiff, quiet voice and without taking his eyes from Mary. 
"What are you doing here? My 
own hypcralter's kid in my house, 
throwing it up to me that I'm 
married to his wife's hypoalter!" 

They did not feel the earth 
move, as she fearfully did. They 
sat there, staring at her, as though 
they might sit forever while she 
backed away, out of the apartment, and ran into her collapsing 
world. 

CONRAD Manz's rest day fell 
the day after Bill Walden's 
kid showed up at his apartment. 
It was ten days since that strait 
jacket of a conference on Santa 
Fe had lost him a chance to blast 
off a rocket racer. This time, on 



the practical knowledge that 
emergency business conferences 
were seldom called after lunch, 
Conrad had placed his reservation for a racer in the afternoon. 
The visit from Mary Waldcn had 
upset him every time he thought 
of it. Since it was his rest day, he 
had no intention of thinking 
about it and Conrad's scrupulously drugged mind was capable 
of just that. 

So now, in the lavish coolness 
of the lounge at the Rocket Club, 
Conrad sipped his drink contentedly and made no contribution to the gloomy conversation 
going on around him. 

"Look at it this way," the melancholy face of Alberts, a pilot 
from England, morosely emphasized his tone. "It takes about 
10.000 economic units to jack a 
forty ton ship up to satellite level 
and snap it around the course 
six times. That's just practice for 
us. On the other hand, an intellectual fellow who spends his 
spare time at a microfilm library 
doesn't use up 1,000 units in a 
year. In fact, his spare time activity may turn up as units 
gained. The Economic Board 
doesn't argue that all pastime 
should be gainful. They just say 
rocket racing wastes more economic units than most pilots 
make on their work days. I tell 
you the day is almost here when 
they ban the rockets." 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



33 



"That's just it," another pilot 
put in. "There was a time when 
you could show that rocket races 
were necessary for better spaceship design. Design has gone way 
beyond that. From their point of 
view we just burn up units as fast 
as other people create them. And 
it's no use trying to argue for the 
television shows. The Board can 
prove people would rather see a 
jet-skiing meet at a cost of about 
one-hundredth that of a rocket 
race." 

Conrad Manz grinned into his 
drink. He had been aware for 
several minutes that pert little 
Angela, Alberts* soft-eyed, huskyvoiced wife, was trying to catch 
his eye. But stranded as she was 
in the buzzing traffic of rockets, 
she was trying to hail the wrong 
rescuer. He had about fifteen 
minutes till the ramp boys would 
have a ship ready for him. Much 
as lie liked Angela, he wasn't 
going to miss that race. 

Still, he let his grin broaden 
and. looking up at her, he lied 
maliciously by nodding. She interpreted this signal as he knew 
she would. Well, at least he 
would afford her a graceful exit 
from the boring conversation. 

He got up and went over and 
took her hand. Her full lips 
parted a little and she kissed him 
on the mouth. 

Conrad turned to Alberts and 
interrupted him. "Angela and I 



would like to spend a little time 
together. Do you mind?" 

Alberts was annoyed at having 
his train of thought broken and 
rather snapped out the usual 
courtesy. "Of course not. I'm glad 
for both of you." 

Conrad looked the group over 
with a bland stare. "Have you 
lads ever tried jet-skiing? There's 
more genuine excitement in ten 
minutes of it than an hour of 
rocket racing. Personally, I don't 
care if the Board does ban the 
rockets soon. I'll just hop out to 
the Rocky Mountains on rest 
days." 

C^ONRAD knew perfectly well 
* that if he had made this 
assertion before asking Alberts 
for his wife, the man would have 
found some excuse to have her 
remain. All the faces present displayed the aficionado's disdain 
for one who has just demonstrated he doesn't belong. What 
the straitiacket did they think 
they were — some ancient order of 
noblemen? 

Conrad took Angela's yielding 
arm and led her serenely away 
before Alberts could think of anything to detain her. 

On the way out of the lounge, 
she stroked his arm with frank 
admiration. "I'm so glad you 
were agreeable. Honestly, Harold 
could talk rockets till I died." 
Conrad bent and kissed her. 



34 




 



"Angela, I'm sorry, but this isn't 
going to be what you think. I 
have a ship to take off in just a 
few minutes." 

She flared and dug into his arm 
now. "Oh, Conrad Manz ! You 
. . . you made me believe . . ,** 

He laughed and grabbed her 
wrists. "Now, now. I'm neglecting 
you to fly a rocket, not just to 
talk about them. I won't let you 
die." 

At that she could not suppress 
her husky musical laugh. "I 
found that out the last time you 
and I were together. Clara and I 
/ had a drink the other day at the 
Citizen's Club. I don't often use 
dirty language, but I told Clara 
she must be keeping you in a 
straitjacket at home." 

Conrad frowned, wishing she 
hadn't brought up the subject. It 
worried him off and on that 
something was wrong with Clara, 
something even worse than that 
awful iitfuming business ten days 
ago. For several shifts now she 
had been cold, nor was it just a 
temporary lack of interest in himself, for she was also cold to the 
men of their acquaintance of 
whom she was usually quite fond. 
As for himself, he had had to 
depend on casual contacts such 
as Angela. Not that they weren't 
pleasant, but a man and wife 
were supposed to maintain a 
healthy love life between themselves, and it usually meant trou


ble with the Medicorps when th!» 
broke down. 

Angela glanced at him. "I 
didn't think Clara laughed well 
at my remark. Is something 
wrong between you?" 

"Oh, no," he declared hastily. 
"Clara is sometimes that way . . • 
doesn't catch a joke right off." 

A page boy approached them 
where they stood in the rotunda 
and advised Conrad that his ship 
was ready. 

"Honestly, Angela, 111 make it 
up, I promise." 

"I know you will, darling. And 
at least I'm grateful you saved 
me from all those rocket jets in 
there." Angela raised her lips for 
a kiss and afterward, as she 
pushed him toward the door, her 
slightly vacant face smiled at 
him. ■ , 

^~^UT on the ramp, Conrad 
found another pilot ready to 
take off. They made two wagera 
— first to reach the racing course, 
and winner in a six-lap heat 
around the six -hundred- mile hexagonal course. 

They fired together and Conrad blasted his ship up on a 
thunderous column of flame that 
squeezed him into his seat. He 
was good at this and he knew he 
would win the lift to the course. 
On the course, though, if his opponent was any good at all, Conrad would probably lose because 



BEYOND B EDI AM 



3& 



fce enjoyed slamming the ship 
around the course in his wasteful, 
swashbuckling style much more 
than merely winning the heat. 

Conrad kept his drive on till 
the last possible second and then 
Shot out his nose jets. The ship 
shuddered up through another 
hundred miles and came to a 
lolling halt near the starting 
buoys. The other pilot gasped 
when Conrad shouted at him over 
the intership. "The winner by all 
thirty heads!" 

It was generally assumed that 
• race up to the course consisted 
of cutting all jets when you had 
enough lift, and using the nose 
brakes only to correct any overshot. "What did you do, just 
keep your power on and flip the 
ship around?" The other racer 
coasted up to Conrad's level and 
steadied with a brief forward 
burst. 

They got the automatic signal 
from the starting buoy and went 
for the first turn, nose and nose, 
about half a mile apart. Conrad 
lost 5000 yards on the first turn 
by shoving his power too hard 
against the starboard steering 
lets. 

It made a pretty picture when 
a racer hammered its way around 
a turn that way with a fan of outside jets holding it in place. The 
other fellow made his turns 
cleanly, using mostly the driving 
jets for steering. But that didn't 



look like much to those who happened to flip on their television 
while this little heat was in progress. On every turn, Conrad lost 
a little in space, but not in the eye 
of the automatic televisor on the 
buoy marking the turn. As usual, 
he cut closer to the buoys than 
regulations allowed, to give the 
folks a show. 

Without the slightest regret, 
Conrad lost the heat by a full two 
sides of the hexagon. He congratulated his opponent and 
watched the fellow let his ship 
down carefully toward earth on 
its tail jets. For a while Conrad 
lolled his ship around near the 
starting buoy and its probably 
watching eye, flipping through a 
series of complicated maneuvers 
with the steering jets. 

Conrad did not like the grim 
countenance of outer space. The 
lifeless, gemlike blaze of cloud 
upon cloud of stars in $hc perspectiveless , black repelled him. 
He liked rocket racing only because of the neat timing necessary, and possibly because the 
knowledge that he indulged in it 
scared poor old Bill Walden half 
to death. 

Today the bleak aspect of the 
Galaxy harried his mind back 
upon its own problems. A particularly nasty association of 
Clara with Bill Walden and his 
sniveling kid kept dogging Conrad's mind and, as soon as stunt 



 



ing had exhausted his excess of 
fuel, he turned the ship to earth 
and sent it in with a short, spectacular burst. 

Now that he stopped to consider it, Clara's strange behavior 
had begun at about the same time 
that Bill Walden started cheating 
on the shifts. That kid Mary must 
have known something was going 
on, or she would not have done 
such a disgusting thing as to 
come to their apartment. 

Conrad had let the rocket fall 
nose-down, until now it was 
screaming into the upper ionosphere. With no time to spare, he 
swiveled the ship on its guiding 
jets and opened the drive blast 
at the up-rushing earth. He had 
just completed this wrenching 
maneuver when two appalling 
things happened together. 

Conrad suddenly knew, whether as a momentary leak from 
Bill's mind to his, or as a rapid 
calculation of his own, that Bill 
Walden and Clara shared a secret At the same moment, something tore through his mind like 
fingers of chill wind. With seven 
gravities mashing him into the 
bucket -seat, he grunted curses 
past thin -stretched lips. 

"Great blue psychiatrists} 
What in thirty straitjackets is 
that three-headed fool trying to 
do, kill us both?" 

Conrad just managed to raise 
his leaden hand and set the 



plummeting racer for automatic 
pilot before Bill Walden forced 
him out of the shift. In his last 
moment of consciousness, and in 
the shock of his overwhelming 
shame. Conrad felt the bitter 
irony that he could not cut the 
power and kill Bill Walden. 

WHEN Bill Walden became 
conscious of the thunderous 
clamor of the braking ship and 
the awful weight of deceleration 
into which he had shifted, the 
core of him froze. He was so terrified that he could not have 
thought of reshifting even had 
there been time. 

His head rolled on the pad in 
spite of its weight, and he saw 
the earth coming at him like a 
monstrous swatter aimed at a fly. 
Between his fright and the inhuman gravity, he lost consciousness without ever seeing on the 
control panel the red warning 
that saved him: Automatic Pilot. 

The ship settled itself on the 
ramp in a mushroom of fire. Bill 
regained awareness several seconds later. He was too shaken to 
do anything but sit there for a 
long time. 

When at last he felt capable 
of moving, he struggled with the 
door till he found how to open 
it, and climbed down to the still hot ramp he had landed on. It 
was at least a mile to the Rocket 
Club across the barren flat of the 



ft E YON o IEDIAM 



37 



field, and he set out on foot. 
Shortly, however, a truck came 
speeding across to him. 

The driver leaned out. "Hey, 
Conrad, what's the matter? Why 
didn't you pull the ship over to 
the hangars?" 

With Conrad's makeup on, Bill 
felt he could probably get by. 
"Controls aren't working," he 
offered noncommittally. 

At the club, a place he had 
never been to before in his life, 
Bill found an unused helicopter 
and started it with his wristband. 
He flew the machine into town to 
the landing station nearest his 
home. 



He was doomed, he knew. Conrad certainly would report him 
for this. He had not intended to 
force the shift so early or so violently. Perhaps he had not intended to force it at all this time. 
But there was something in him 
more powerful than himself . . . 
a need to break the shift and be 
with Clara that now acted almost independently of him and 
certainly without regard for his 
safety. 

Bill flew his craft carefully 
through the city traffic, working 
his way between the widely 
spaced towers with the uncertain 
hand of one to whom machines 




 



are not an extension of the body. 
He put the helicopter down at 
the landing station with some difficulty. 

Clara would not be expecting 
him so early. From his apartment, as soon as he had changed 
makeup, he visiophoned her. It 
was strange how long and how 
carefully they needed to look at 
each other and how few words 
they could say. 

Afterward, he seemed calmer 
and went about getting ready 
with more efficiency. But when 
he found himself addressing the 
package of Conrad's clothes to 
his home, he chuckled bitterly. 



It was when he went back to 
drop the package in the mail 
chute that he noticed the storage 
room door ajar. He disposed of 
the package and went over to the 
door. Then he stood still, listening. He had to stop his own 
breathing to hear clearly. 

Bill tightened himself and 
opened the door. He flipped on 
the light and saw Mary. The 
child sat on the floor in the 
corner with her knees drawn up 
against her chest. Between the 
knees and the chest, the frail 
wrists were crossed, the hands 
closed limply like — like those 
of a fetus. The forehead rested 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



39 



on the knees so that, should the 
closed eyes stray open, they 
would be looking at the placid 
hands. 

The sickening sight of the child 
Squeezed down on his heart till 
the color drained from his face. 
He went forward and knelt before 
her. His dry throat hammered 
with the words, what have I done 
to you, but he could not speak. 
The question of how long she 
might have been here, he could 
not bear to think. 

He put out his hand, but he did 
not touch her. A shudder of revulsion shook him and he scrambled to his feet. He hurried back 
into the apartment with only one 
thought. He must get someone to 
help her. Only the Medicorps 
could take care of a situation like 
this. 

As he stood at the visiophone, 
he knew that this involuntary act 
of panic had betrayed all that he 
had ever thought and done. He 
had to call the Medicorps. He 
could not face the result of his 
own behavior without them. Like 
a ghostly after-image, he saw 
Clara's face on the screen. She 
Was lost, cut off, with only himself to depend on. 

A part of him, a place where 
there were no voices and a great 
tragedy, had been abruptly shut 
off. He stood stupidly confused 
and disturbed about something 
he couldn't recall. The emotion 



in his body suddenly had no 
referent. He stood like a badly 
frightened animal while his heart 
slowed and blood seeped again 
into whitened parenchymas, while 
tides of epinephrine burned lower. 

Remembering he must hurry, 
Bill left the apartment. It was an 
apartment with its storage room 
door closed, an apartment without a storage room. 

From the moment that he 
walked in and took Clara in his 
arms, he was not worried about 
being caught. He felt only the 
great need for her. There seemed 
only one difference from the first 
time and it was a good difference, 
because now Clara was so tense 
and apprehensive. He felt a new 
tenderness for her, as one might 
feel for a child. It seemed to him 
that there was no end to the well 
of gentleness and compassion 
that was suddenly in him. He was 
mystified by the depth of this 
feeling. He kissed her again and 
again and petted her as one might 
a disturbed child. 

Clara said, "Oh, Bill, we're deling wrong! Mary was here yesterday!" 

Whoever she meant, it had no 
meaning for him. He said, "It's 
all right. You mustn't worry." 

"She needs you, Bill, and I 
take you away from her." 

Whatever it was she was talking about was utterly unimportant beside the fact that she was 



40 




 



not happy herself. He soothed 
her. "Darling, you mustn't worry 
about it. Let's be happy the way 
we used to be." 

He led her to a couch and they 
sat together, her head resting on 
his shoulder. 

"Conrad is worried about me. 
He knows something is wrong. 
Oh. Bill, if he kncw t he'd demand 
the worst penalty for you." 

Bill felt the stone of fear come 
back in his chest. He thought, 
too, of Helen, of how intense her 
shame would be. Medicorps action would be machinelike, logical as a set of equation; they 
were very likely to take more 
drastic steps where the complaints 
would be so strong and no request 
for leniency forthcoming. Conrad 
knew now, of course. Bill had 
felt his hate. 

It was nearing the end. Death 
would come to Bill with electronic fingers. A ghostly probing 
in his mind and suddenly . . . 

Clara's great unhappiness and 
the way she turned her head into 
his shoulder to cry forced him to 
calm the rising panic in himself, 
and again to caress the fear from 
her. 

Even later, when they lay 
where the moonlight thrust into 
the room an impalpable shaft of 
alabaster, he loved her only as a 
succor. Carefully, slowly, smoothing out her mind, drawing it away 
from all the other things, draw


ing it down into this one thing. 
Gathering all her mind into her 
senses and holding it there. Then 
quickly taking it away from her 
in a moaning spasm so that now 
she was murmuring, murmuring, 
palely drifting. Sleeping like a 
loved child. 

For a long, long time he 
watched the white moon cut its 
arc across their window. He listened with a deep pleasure to her 
evenly breathing sleep. But 
slowly he realized that her 
breath had changed, that the 
body so close to his was tensing. 
His heart gave a great bound and 
tiny moths of horror fluttered 
along his back. He raised himself and saw that the eyes were 
open in the silver light. Even 
through the makeup he saw that 
they were Helen's eyes. 

He did the only thing left for 
him. He shifted. But in that terrible instant he understood something he had not anticipated. In 
Helen's eyes there was not only 
intense shame over shifting into 
her hypoalter's home; there was 
not only the disgust with himself 
for breaking communication 
codes. He saw that, as a woman 
of the 20th Century might have 
felt, Helen hated Clara as a 
sexual rival. She hated Clara 
doubly because he had turned 
not to some other woman, but to 
the other part of herself whom 
she could never know. 



BEYOND BED LAM 



41 



As he shifted, Bill knew that 
the next light he saw would be 
on the adamant face of the Medicorps. 

MAJOR Paul Grey, with two 
other Medicorps officers, entered the Walden apartment 
about two hours after Bill left it 
to meet Clara. Major Grey was 
angry with himself. Important 
information on a case of communication-breaks and drug-refusal could be learned by letting 
it run its course under observation. But he had not intended 
Conrad Manz's life to be endangered, and certainly he would 
not have taken the slightest 
chance on what they found in the 
Walden apartment if he had expected it this early. 

Major Grey blamed himself for 
what had happened to Mary 
Walden. He should have had the 
machines watching Susan and 
Mary at the same time that they 
were relaying all wristband data 
for Bill and Conrad and for Helen 
and Clara to his office. 

He had not done this because 
It was Susan's shift and he had 
not expected Mary to break it. 
Now he knew that Helen and Bill 
Walden had been quarreling over 
the fact that Clara was cheating 
on Helen's shifts, and their conversations had directed the unhappy child's attention to the 
Manz couple. She had broken 



shift to meet them . . . looking 
for a loving father, of course. 

Still — things would not have 
turned out so badly if Captain 
Thiel, Mary's school officer, had 
not attributed Susan Shorrs' disappearance only to poor drug acclimatization. Captain Thiel had 
naturally known that Major 
Grey was in town to prosecute 
Bill Walden, because the major 
had called on him to discuss the 
case. Vet it had not occurred to 
him. until 18 hours after Susan's 
disappearance, that Mary might 
have forced the shift for some 
reason associated with her aberrant father. 

By the time the captain advised 
him. Major Grey already knew 
that Bill had forced the shift on 
Conrad under desperate circumstances and he had decided to 
close in. He fully expected to find 
the father and daughter at the 
apartment, and now ... it sickened htm to see the child's demented condition and realize that 
Bill had left her there. 

Major Grey could see at a 
glance that Mary Walden would 
not fee accessible for days even 
with the best treatment. He left 
it to the other two officers to 
hospitalize the child" and set out 
for the Manz apartment. 

He used his master wristband 
to open the door there, and found 
a woman standing in the middle 
of the room, wrapped in a sheet. 



42 




 



He knew that this must be Helen 
Walden, It was odd how ill-fitting Clara Manz's softly sensual 
makeup seemed, even to . a 
stranger, on the more rigidly composed face before him. He guessed 
that Helen would wear color 
higher on her cheeks and the 
mouth would be done in severe 
lines. Certainly the present 
haughty face struggled with its 
incongruous makeup as well as 
the indignity of her dress. 

She pulled the sheet tighter 
about her and said icily, "I will 
not wear that woman's clothes." 

Major Grey introduced himself 
and asked, "Where is Bill Walden?" 

"He shifted! He left me with 
• . . Oh, I'm so ashamed!" 

Major Grey shared her loathing. There was no way to escape 
the conditioning of childhood — 
sex relations between hyperalter 
and hypoalter were more than 
outlawed, they were in themselves disgusting. If they w.ere 
allowed, they could destroy this 
civilization. Those idealists — -they 
were almost all hypoalters. of 
course — who wanted the old terminology changed didn't take 
that into account. Next thing 
they'd want children to live with 
their actual parents! 

Major Grey stepped into the 
bedroom. Through the bathroom 
door beyond, he could see Conrad Manz changing his makeup. 



Conrad turned and eyed him 
bluntly. "Would you mind staying out of here till I'm finished? 
I've had about all I can take." 

Major Grey shut the door and 
returned to Helen Walden. He 
took a hypothalamic block from 
his own pharmacase and handed 
it to her. "Here, you're probably 
on very low drug levels. You'd 
better take this." He poured her 
a glass of pop from a decanter 
and, while they waited for Conrad, he dialed the nearest shifting station on the visiophone and 
ordered up an emergency shifting costume for her. 

When at last they were both 
dressed, made up to their satisfaction and drugged to his satisfaction, he had them sit on a 
couch together across from him. 
They sat at opposite ends of it. 
stiff with resentment at each 
other's presence. 

Major Grey said calmly, "You 
realize that this matter is coming 
to a Medicorps trial. It will be 
serious." 

Major Grey watched their 
faces. On hers he saw grim determination. On Conrad's face he 
saw the heavy movement of 
alarm. The man loved his wife. 
That was going to help. "It is 
necessary in a case such as this 
for the Medicorps to weigh your 
decisions along with the scientific 
evidence we will accumulate. Unfortunately, the number of lay


BEYOND BEDLAM 



43 



men directly involved in this case 
* — and not on trial — is only two, 
due to your peculiar marriage. 
If the hypoalters, Clara and Conrad, were married to other partners, we might call on as many as 
six involved persons and obtain 
a more equitable lay judgment. 
As it stands, the entire responsibility rests on the two of you." 

Helen Walden was primly confident. "I don't see how we can 
fail to treat the matter with perfect logic. After all, it is not we 
who neglect our drug levels . . . 
They were refusing to take their 
drugs, weren't they?'* she asked, 
hoping for the worst and certain 
she was right. 

41 Yes, this is drug refusal." 
Major Grey paused while she 
relished the answer. "But I must 
correct you in one impression. 
Your proper drug levels do not 
assure that you will act logically 
in this matter. The drugged mind 
is logical. However, its fundamental datum is that the drugs 
and drugged minds must be protected before everything else." He 
watched Conrad's face while he 
added, "Because of this, it is possible for you to arrive logically 
at a conclusion that . . . death 
is the required solution." He 
pa-ised, looking at their white 
lip*. Then he said, "Actually, 
other, more suitable solutions 
may be possible." 

"But they were refusing their 



drugs," she said. "You talk as 
if j'ou are defending them. Aren't 
you a Medicorps prosecutor?" 

"I do not prosecute people in 
the ancient 20th Century sense, 
Mrs. Walden. I prosecute the acts 
of drug refusal and communication breaks. There is quite a difference.*' 

"Well!" she said almost explosively. "I always knew Bill 
would get into trouble sooner or 
later with his wild, antisocial 
ideas. I never dreamed the Medicorps would take fir's side." 

Major Grey held his breath, 
almost certain now that she 
would walk into the trap. If she 
did, he could save Clara Manz 
before the trial. 

"After all, they have broken 
every communication code. They 
have refused the drugs, a defiance 
aimed at our very lives. They — ** 

"Shut up!" It was the first time 
Conrad Manz had spoken since 
he sat down. "The Medicorps 
spent weeks gathering evidence 
end preparing their recommendations. You haven't seen any of 
that and you've already made up 
your mind. How logical is that? 
It sounds as if you'ivanr your 
husband dead. Maybe the poor 
devil had some reason, after all, 
for what he did." On the man's 
face there was the nearest approach to hate that the drugs 
would allow. 

Major Grey let his breath out 



44 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



Softly. They were split permanently. She would have to trade 
him a mild decision on Clara in 
order to save Bill. And even there, 
if the subsequent evidence gave 
any slight hope. Major Grey believed now that he could work 
on Conrad to hang the lay judgment and let the Medicorps' 
scientific recommendation go 
through unmodified. 

He let them stew in their crosspurposed silence for a while and 
then nailed home a disconcerting 
fact. 

"I think I should remind you 
that there are few advantages to 
having your alter extinguished 
in the mnemonic eraser. A man 
whose hyperalter has been extinguished must report on his 
regular shift days to a hospital 
and be placed for five days in 
suspended animation. This is not 
very healthy for the body, but 
necessary. Otherwise, everyone's 
natural distaste for his own alter 
and the understandable wish to 
spend twice as much time living 
would generate schemes to have 
One's alter sucked out by the 
eraser. That happened extensively back in the 21st Century 
before the five day suspension 
was required. It was also used 
as a 'cure' for schizophrenia, but 
it was, of course, only the brutal 
murder of innocent personalities." 

Major Grey smiled grimly to 
himself. "Now I will have to ask 



you both t* accompany me to the 
hospital. I will want you. Mrs. 
Walden, to shift at once to Mrs. 
Manz. Mr. Manz, you will have 
to remain under the close observation of an officer until Bill 
Walden tries to shift back. We 
have to catch him with an injection to keep him in shift." 

*T>HE young mcdicop put the 
-■- syringe aside and laid his 
hand on Bill Waldcn's forehead. 
He pushed the hair back out of 
Bill's eyes. 

"There, Mr. Walden, you don't 
have to struggle now." 

Bill let his breath out in a long 
sigh. "You've caught me. I can't 
shift any more, can I?" 

"That's right, Mr. Walden. Not 
unless we want you to." The 
young man picked up his medical 
equipment and stepped aside. 

Bill noticed then the Medicorps officer standing in the 
background. The man was watching as though he contemplated 
some mehincholy distance. "I am 
Major Grey, Bill. I'm handling 
your case." 

Bill did not answer. He lay 
staring at the hospital ceiling. 
Then he felt his mouth open in a 
slow grin. 

"What's funny?" Major Grey 
asked mildly. 

"Leaving my hypoaltcr with 
my wife." Bill answered candidly. It had already ceased to 



BEYOND B E OLA M 



45 



be funny to him, but he saw 
Major Grey smile in spite of himself. 

"They were quite upset when I 
found them. It must have been 
some scramble before that." 
Major Grey came over and sat in 
the chair vacated by the young 
man who had just injected Bill. 
"You know, Bill, we will need a 
complete analysis of you. We 
want to do everything we can to 
save you, but it will require your 
cooperation." 

Bill nodded, feeling his chest 
tighten. Here it came. Right to 
the end, they would be tearing 
him apart to find out what made 
him work. 

Major Grey must have sensed 
Bill's bitter will to resist. His 
resonant voice was soft, his face 
kindly. "We must have your sincere desire to help. We can't force 
you to do anything." 

"Except die," Bill said. 

"Maybe helping us get the information that might save your 
life at the trial isn't worth the 
trouble to you. But your aberration has seriously disturbed the 
lives of several people. Don't you 
think you owe it to them to help 
us prevent this sort of thing in 
the future?" Major Grey ran his 
hand through his whitening hair. 
"I thought you would like to 
know Mary will come through all 
right. We will begin shortly to acclimatize her to her new appoint


ed parents, who will be visiting 
her each day. That will accelerate her recovery a great deal. Of 
course, right now she is still inaccessible." 

The brutally clear picture of 
Mary alone in the storage room 
crashed back into Bill's mind. 
After a while, in such slow stages 
that the beginning was hardly noticeable, he began to cry. The 
young medicop injected him with 
a sleeping compound, but not before Bill knew he would do whatever the Medicorps wanted. 

npHE next day was crowded 
-"- with battery after battery of 
tests. The interviews were endless. 
He was subjected to a hundred 
artificial situations and every reaction from his blood sugar to the 
frequency ranges of his voice was 
measured. They gave him only 
small amounts of drugs in order 
to test his reaction to them. 

Late in the evening, Major 
Grey came by and interrupted an 
officer who was taking an electroencephalogram for the sixth time 
after injection of a drug. 

"AH right, Bill, you have really 
given us cooperation. But after 
you've had your dinner, I hope 
you won't mind if I come to your 
room and talk with you for a 
little while." 

When Bill finished eating, he $ 
waited impatiently in his room 
for the Medicorps officer. Major 




 



Grey came soon after. He shook 
his head at the mute question 
Bill shot at him. 

"No, Bill. We will not have the 
results of your tests evaluated 
until late tomorrow morning. I 
can't tell you a thing until the 
trial in any case." 

"When will that be?" 

"As soon as the evaluation of 
your tests is in." Major Grey ran 
his hand over his smooth chin and 
seemed to sigh. "Tell me, Bill, 
how do you feel about your case? 
How did you get into this situation and what do you think about 
it now?" The officer sat in the 
room's only chair and motioned 
Bill to the cot. 

Bill was astonished at his sudden desire to talk about his problem. He had to laugh to cover it 
up. "I guess I feel as if I am being 
condemned for trying to stay 
sober." Bill used the ancient word 
with a mock tone of righteousness 
that he knew the major would 
understand. 

Major Grey smiled. "How do 
you feel when you're sober?" 

Bill searched his face, "The 
way the ancient Moderns did, I 
guess. I feel what happens to 
me the way it happens to me, not 
the artificial way the drugs let 
it happen. I think there is a way 
for us to live without the dfugs 
and really enjoy life. Have you 
ever cut down on your drugs. 
Major?" 



The officer shook his head. 

Bill smiled at him dreamily. 
"You ought to try it. It's as 
though a new life has suddenly 
opened up. Everything looks different to you. 

"Look, with an average life 
span of 100 years, each of us 
only lives 50 years and our alter 
lives the other 50. Yet even on 
half-time we experience only 
about half the living we'd do if 
we didn't take the drugs. We 
would be able to feel the loves 
and hatreds and desires of life. 
No matter how many mistakes 
we made, we would be able occasionally to live those intense 
moments that made the ancients 
great." 

Major Grey said tonelessly, 
"The ancients were great at killing, cheating and debasing one 
another. And they were worse 
sober than drunk." This time he 
did not smile at the word. 

Bill understood the implacable 
logic before him. Th* logic that 
had saved man from himself by 
smothering his spirit. The carefully achieved logic of the drugs 
that had seized upon the disassociated personality, and engineered it into a smoothly running machine, where there was 
no unhappiness because there was 
no great happiness, where there 
was no crime except failure to 
take the drugs or cross the alter 
sex line. Without drugs, he was 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



47 



capable of fury and he felt it now. 

"You should see how foolish 
these communication codes look 
when you are undrugged. This 
stupid hide-and-seek of shifting! 
These two-headed monsters simpering about their artificial 
morals and their endless prescriptions ! T hey belong in crazy 
houses! What use is there in such 
a world? If we are all this sick, 
we should die . . 

Bill stopped and there was suddenly a ringing silence in the barren little room. 

Finally Major Grey said, "I 
think you can see, Bill, that your 
desire to live without drugs is incompatable with this society. It 
would be impossible for us to 
maintain in you an artificial need 
for the drugs that would be 
healthy. Only if we can clearly 
demonstrate that this aberration 
is not an inherent part of your 
personality can we do something 
medically or psycho -surgically 
about it." 

Bill did not at first see the implication in this. When he did, he 
thought of Clara rather than of 
himself, and his voice was shaken. 
"Is it a localized aberration in 
Clara?" 

Major Grey looked at him 
levelly. "I have arranged for you 
to be with Clara Manz a little 
while in the morning." He stood 
up and said good night and was 
gone. 



Slowly, as if it hurt him to 
move, Bill turned off the light 
and lay on the cot in the semidark. After a while he could feel 
his heart begin to take hold and 
he started feeling better. It was 
as though a man who had 
thought himself permanently expatriated had been told, "Tomorrow, you walk just over that 
hill and you will be home." 

All through the night he lay 
awake, alternating between panic 
and desperate longing in a cycle 
with which finally he became familiar. At last, as a rusty light of 
dawn reddened his silent room, 
he fell into a troubled sleep. 

He started awake in broad daylight. An orderly was at the door 
with his breakfast tray. He could 
not eat, of course. After the orderly left, he hastily changed to 
a new hospital uniform and 
washed himself. He redid his 
makeup with a trembling hand, 
straightened the bedclothes and 
then he sat on the edge of the cot. 

No one came for him. 

The young medicop who had 
given him the injection that 
caught him in shift finally entered, and was standing near him 
before Bill was aware of his presence. 

"Good morning, Mr. Walden. 
How are you feeling?" 

Bill's wildly oscillating tensions froze at the point where he 
could only move helplessly with 



♦I 




 



events and suffer a constant, unchangeable longing. 

It was as if in a dream that 
they moved in silence together 
down the long corridors of the 
hospital and took the elevator to 
an upper floor. The medicop 
opened the door to a room and 
let Bill enter. Bill heard the door 
close behind him. 

Clara did not turn from where 
she stood looking out the window. Bill did not care that the 
walls of the chill little room were 
almost certainly recording every 
sight and sound. All his hunger 
was focused on the back of the 
girl at the window. The room 
seemed to ring with his racing 
blood. But he was slowly aware 
that something was wrong, and 
when at last he called her name, 
his voice broke. 

Still without turning, she said 
in a strained monotone, "I want 
you to understand that I have 
consented to this meeting only 
because Major Grey has assured 
me ij is necessary." 

It was a long time before he 
could speak. "Clara, I need you." 

She spun on him. ''Have you 
no shame? You are married to 
my hy per a Iter— don't you understand that?" Her face was suddenly wet with tears and the intensity of her shame flamed at 
him from her cheeks. "How can 
Conrad ever forgive me for being 
with his hyperalter and talking 



about him? Oh, how can I have 
been so mad?" 

"They have done something to 
you," he said, shaking with tension. 

Her chin raised at this. She 
was defiant, he saw, though not 
toward himself — he no longer existed for her — but toward that 
part of herself which once had 
needed him and now no longer 
existed. "They have cured me,** 
she declared. "They have cured 
me of everything but my shame, 
and they will help me get rid of 
that as soon as you leave this 
room." 

Bill stared at her before leaving. Out in the corridor, the 
young medicop did not look him 
in the face. They went back to 
Bill's room and the officer left 
without a word. Bill lay down on 
his cot. 

Presently Major Grey entered 
the room. He came over to the 
cot. "I'm sorry it had to be this 
way. Bill." 

Bill's words came tonelessly 
from his dry throat. "Was it necessary to be cruel?" 

"It was necessary to test the 
result of her psycho-surgery. 
Also, it will help her over her 
shame. She might otherwise have 
retained a seed of fear that she 
still loved you." 

Bill did not feel anything any 
more. Staring at the ceiling, he 
knew there was no place left for 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



him in this world and no one in 
it who needed him. The only 
person who had really needed 
him had been Mary, and he 
could not bear to think of how he 
had treated her. Now the Medicorps was efficiently curing the 
child of the hurt he had done 
her. They had already erased 
from Clara any need for him she 
had ever felt. 

This seemed funny and he began to laugh. "Everyone is being 
cured of me." 

"Yes, Bill. That is necessary." 
When Bill went on laughing

Major Grey's voice turned quite 
sharp. "Come with me. It's time 
for your trial." 

rriHE enormous room in which 
they held the trial was utterly barren. At the great oaken 
table around which they all sat, 
there were three Medicorps officers in addition to Major Grey. 

Helen did not speak to Bill 
when they brought him in. He 
was placed on the same side of 
the table with an officer between 
them. Two orderlies stood behind 
Bill's chair. Other than these people, there was no one in the room. 

The great windows were high 
above the floor and displayed 
only the blissful sky. Now and 
then Bill saw a flock of pigeons 
waft aloft on silver-turning wings. 
Everyone at the table except himself had a copy of his case report 



end they discussed it with clipped 
sentences. Between the stone floor 
and the vaulted ceiling, a subtle 
echolalia babbled about Bill's 
problem behind their human talk. 

The discussion of the report 
lulled when Major Grey rapped 
on the table. He glanced unsmiling from face to face, and his 
voice hurried the ritualized 
words: "This is a court of medicine, co-joining the results of 
medical science and considered 
lay judgment to arrive at a decision in the case of patient Bill 
Walden. The patient is hospitalized for a history of drug refusal 
and communication breaks. We 
have before us the medical case 
record of patient Walden. Has 
everyone present studied this record?" 

All at the table nodded. 

"Do all present feel competent 




BEYOND BE OLA* 



to pass judgment in this case?" 

Again there came the agreement. 

Major Grey continued, "It is 
my duty to advise you. in the 
presence of the patient, of the 
profound difference between a 
trial for simple drug refusal and 
one in which that aberration is 
compounded with communica tion breaks. 

"It is true that no other aber-' 
ration is possible when the drugs 
are taken as prescribed. After all, 
the drugs are the basis for our 
schizophrenic society. Nevertheless, simple drug refusal often is 
a mere matter of physiology, 
which is easy enough to remedy. 

"A far more profound threat 
to our society is the break in 
communication. This generally is 
more deeply motivated in the patient, and is often inaccessible to 
tlierapy. Such a patient is driven 
to emotive explorations which 
place the various ancient passions, and the infamous art of 

historical gesture, such as 'give 
me liberty or give me death,' 
above the welfare of society." 

¥>ILL watched the birds flash 
down the sky. a handful of 
heavenly coin. Never had it 
seemed to him so good to look at 
the sky. If they hospitalize me, 
he thought, / wilt be content forever to sit and took from windows. 



"Our schizophrenic society." 
Major Grey was saying, "holds 
together and runs smoothly because, in each individual, the personality conflicts have been 
compartmentalized between hyperalter and hypoalter. On the 
social level, conflicting personalities are kept on opposite shifts 
and never contact each other. Or 
they are kept on shifts where contact is possible no more than one 
or two days out of ten. Bill Waldcn*s break of shift is the type of 
behavior designed to reactivate 
these conflicts, and to generate 
the destructive passions on which 
an undrugged mind feeds. Already illness and disrupted lives 
have resulted." 

Major Grey paused and looked 
directly at Bit I. "Exhaustive tests 
have demonstrated that your entire personality is involved. I 
might also say that the aberration 
to live without the drugs and to 
break communication codes is 
your personality. All these Medicorps officers arc agreed on that 
diagnosis. It remains now for us 
of the Medicorps to sit with the 
laymen intimately involved and 
decide on the action to be taken. 
The only possible alternatives 
after that diagnosis are permanent hospitalization or . . . total 
removal of the personality by 
mnemonic erasure." 

Bill could not speak. He saw 
Major Grey nod to one of the 



St 




 



orderlies and felt the man pushing up his sleeve and injecting 
his nerveless arm. They were 
forcing him to shift, he knew, so 
that Conrad Manz could sit on 
the trial and participate. 

Helplessly, he watched the 
great sky blacken and the room 
dim and disappear. 

[V/|AJOR Grey did not avert his 
1TM f ace as the others, while 
the shift was in progress. Helen 
Walden, he saw, was dramatizing 
her shame at being present during a shift, but the Medicorps 
officers simply stared at the 
table. Major Grey watched the 
face of Conrad Manz take form 
while the man who was going to 
be tried faded. 

Bill Walden had been without 
makeup, and as soon as he was 
sure Manz could hear him, Major 
Grey apologized. "I hope you 
won't object to this brief interlude in public without makeup. 
You are present at the trial of 
Bill Walden." 

Conrad Manz nodded and 
Major Grey waited another full 
minutr for the shift to complete 
itself before he continued. "Mr. 
Manz, during the two days you 
waited in the hospital for us to 
catch Walden in shift, 1 discussed 
this case quite thoroughly with 
you, especially as it applied to 
the case of Clara Manz, on which 
we were already working. 



'*You will recall that in the case 
of your wife, the Medicorps diagnosis was one of a clearly localized aberration. It was quite simple to apply the mnemonic eraser 
to that small section without disturbing in any way her basic 
personality. Medicorps agreement 
was for this procedure and the 
case did not come to trial, but 
simply went to operation, because 
lay agreement was obtained. 
First yourself and eventually — " 
Major Grey paused and let the 
memory of Helen's stubborn insistence that Clara die stir in 
Conrad's mind — "Mrs. Walden 
agreed with the Medicorps." 

Major Grey let the room wait 
in "silence for a while. "The case 
of Bill Walden is quite different. 
The aberration involves the whole 
personality, and the alternative 
actions to be taken are. permanent hospitalization or total erasure. In this case, I believe that 
Medicorps opinion will be divided 
as to proper action and — " Major 
Grey paused again and looked 
levelly at Conrad Manz— "this 
may be true, al so, of the lay 
opinion." 

"How's that. Major?" demanded the highest ranking 
Medicorps officer present, a colonel named Hart, a tall, handsome man on whom the military 
air was a becoming skin. "What 
do you mean about Medicorps 
opinion being divided?" 



BEYOND BEDLAM 



3* 



Major Grey answered quietly, 
"I'm holding out for hospitalization." 

Colonel Hart's face reddened. 
He thrust it forward and straightened his back. "That's preposterous! This is a clear-cut case of 
a dangerous threat to our society, 
and we, let me remind you, are 
sworn to protect that society." 

Major Grey felt very tired. It 
was. after all, difficult to understand why he always fought so 
hard against erasure of these aberrant cases. But he began with 
quiet determination. "The threat 
to society is effectively removed 
by either of the alternatives, hospitalization or total erasure. I 
think you can all see from Bill 
Walden's medical record that his 
is a well rounded personality with 
a remarkable mind. In the environment of the 20th Century, 
he would have been an outstanding citizen, and possibly, if there 
had been more like him. our present society would have been better for it. 

"Our history has been one of 
weeding out all personalities that 
did not fit easily into our drugged 
society. Today there are so few 
left that I have handled only 136 
in my entire career . . 

Major Grey saw that Helen 
Walden was tensing in her chair. 
He realized suddenly that she 
sensed better than he the effect he 
was having on the other men. 



"We should not forget that 
each time we erase one of these 
personalties," he pressed on relentlessly, "society loses irrevocably a certain capacity for 
change. If we eliminate all personalities who do not fit, we may 
find ourselves without any minds 
capable of meeting future change. 
Our direct ancestors were largely 
the inmates of mental hospitals 
... we are fortunate they were not 
erased. Conrad Manz," he asked 
abruptly, "what is your opinion 
on the case of Bill Walden?" 

Helen Walden started, but 
Conrad Manz shrugged his muscular shoulders. "Oh, hospitalize 
the three-headed monster!" 

Major Grey snapped his eyes 
directly past Colonel Hart and 
fastened them on the Medicorps 
captain. "Your opinion, Captain?" 

But Helen Walden was too 
quick. Before he could rap the 
table for order, she had her thin 
words hanging in the echoing 
room. "Having been Mr. Walden's wife for 15 years, my sentiments naturally incline me to ask 
for hospitalization. That is why 
I may safely say, if Major Grey 
will pardon me, that the logic of 
the drugs does not entirely fail 
us in a situation like this." 

Helen waited while all present 
got the idea that Major Grey had 
accused them of being illogical. 
"Bill's aberration has led to 9ur 




 



daughter's illness. And think how 
quickly it contaminated Clara 
Manz! I cannot ask that society 
any longer expose itself, even to 
the extent of keeping Bill in the 
isolation of the hospital, for my 
purely sentimental reasons. 

"As for Major Grey's closing 
remarks, I cannot see how it is 
fair to bring my husband to trial 
as a threat to society, if some 
future chance is expected, in 
which a man of his behavior 
would benefit society. Surely such 
a change could only be one that 
would ruin our present world, or 
Bill would hardly fit it. I would 
not want to save Bill or anyone 
else for such a future." 

She did not have to say anything further. Both of the other 
Medicorps officers were now 
fully roused to their duty. Colonel 
Hart, of course, "humphed" at 
the opinions of a woman and cast 
his with Major Grey. But the fate 
of Bill Walden was sealed. 

Major Grey sat, weary and uneasy, as the creeping little doubts 
began. In the end, he would be 
left with the one big stone-heavy 
doubt . . . could he have gone 
through with this if he had not 
been drugged, and how would the 
logic of the trial look without 
drugs? * 

He became aware of the restiveness in the room. They were 
waiting for him, now that the 
decision was irrevocable. With


out the drugs, he reflected, they, 
might be feeling — what was the 
ancient word, guilt? No, that was 
what the criminal felt. .Remorse? 
That would be what they should 
be feeling. Major Grey wished 
Helen Walden could be forced to 
witness the erasure. People did 
not realize what it was like. 

What was it Bill had said? 
"You should see how foolish these 
communication codes look when 
you are undrugged. This stupid 
hide-and-seek of shifting . . ,** 

Well, wasn't that a charge to 
be inspected seriously, if you 
were taking it seriously enough 
to kill the man for it? As soon 
as this case was completed, he 
would have to return to his city 
and blot himself out so that his 
own hyperalter, Ralph Singer, a 
painter of bad pictures and a 
useless fool, could waste five more 
days- To that man he lost half 
his possible living days. What 
earthly good was Singer? 

Major Grey roused himself and 
motioned the orderly to inject 
Conrad 'Manz, so that Bill Walden would be forced back into 
shift. 

"As soon as I have 'advised the 
patient of our decision, you will 
all be dismissed. Naturally, I 
anticipated this decision and have 
arranged for immediate erasure. 
After the erasure, Mr. Manz, you 
will be instructed to appear regularly for suspended animation.**

FOR some reason, the first 
thing Bill Walden did when 
he became conscious of his surroundings was to look out the 
great window for the flock of 
birds. But they were gone. 

Bill looked at Major Grey and 
said, "What are you going to do?" 

The officer ran his hand back 
through his whitening hair, but 
he looked at Bill without wavering. "You will be erased." 

Bill began to shake his head. 
"There is something wrong," he 
said. 

"Bill . . T the major began. 

"There is something wrong," 
Bill repeated hopelessly. "Why 
must we be split so there is always something missing in each 
of us? Why must we be stupefied 
with drugs that keep us from 
knowing what we should feel? I 
was trying to live a better life. I 
did not want to hurt anyone." 

"But you did hurt others," 
Major Grey said bluntly. "You 
would do so again if allowed to 
function in your own way in this 
society. Yet it would be insufferable to you to be hospitalized. 
You would be shut off forever 
from searching for another Clara 
Manz. And— there is no one else 
for you, is there?" 

Bill looked up, his eyes cringing as though they stared at 
death. "No one else?" he asked 
Vacantly. "No one?" 

The two orderlies lifted him 



up by his arms, almost carrying 
him into the operating room. His 
feet dragged helplessly. He made 
no resistance as they lifted him 
onto the operating table and 
strapped him down. 

Beside him was the great panel 
of the mnemonic eraser with its 
thousand unblinking eyes. The 
helmetlike prober cabled to this 
calculator was fastened about his 
skull, and he could no longer see 
the professor who was lecturing 
in the amphitheater above. But 
along his body he could see the 
group of medical students. They 
were looking at him with great 
interest, too young not to let the 
human drama interfere with their 
technical education. 

The professor, however, droned 
in a purely objective voice. "The 
mnemonic eraser can selectively 
shunt from the brain any identic 
fiable category of memory, and 
erase the synaptic patterns associated with its translation into 
action. Circulating memory is 
disregarded. The machine only 
locates and shunts out those energies present as permanent 
memory. These are there in part 
as permanently echoing frequencies in closed cytoplasmic systems. These systems are in contact with the rest of the nervous 
system only during the phenomenon of remembrance. Remembrance occurs when, at all the 
synapses in a given network *y t * 




 



the permanently echoing frequencies are duplicated as transient 
circulating frequencies. 

"The objective in a total operation of the sort before us is to 
distinguish all the stored permanent frequencies, typical of the 
personality you wish to extinguish, from the frequencies typical of the other personality present in the brain." 

Major Grey's face, very tired, 
but still wearing a mask of adamant reassurance, came into Bill's 
vision. "There will be a few moments of drug-induced terror, 
Bill. That is necessary for the operation. I hope knowing it beforehand will help you ride with it. 
It ■ will not be for long." He 
squeezed Bill's shoulder and was 
gone. 

"The trick was learned early in 
our history, when this type of 
total operation was more often 
necessary," the professor continued. "It is really quite simple to 
extinguish one personality while 
leaving the other undisturbed. 
The other personality in the case 
before up has been drug-immobilized to keep this one from 
shifting. At the last moment, this 
personality before us will be 
drug -stimulated to bring it to 
the highest possible pitch of total 
activity. This produces utterly 
disorganized activity, every involved neuron and synapse being 
activated simultaneously by the 

BEYOND BEDLAM 



drug. It is then a simple matter 
for the mnemonic eraser to locate 
all permanently echoing frequencies involved in this personality 
and suck them into its receiver." 

Bill was suddenly aware that a 
needle had been thrust into his 
arm. Then it was as though all 
the terror, panic and traumatic 
incidents of his whole life leaped 
into his mind. All the pleasant experiences and feelings he had ever 
known were there, too, but were 
transformed into terror. 

A bell was ringing with regular strokes. Across the panel of 
the mnemonic eraser, the tiny 
counting lights were alive with 
movement. 

There was in Bill a fright, a 
demand for survival so great that 
it could not be felt. 

It was actually from an island 
of complete calm that part of him 
saw the medical students rising 
dismayed and white-faced from 
their seats. It was apart from 
himself that his body strained to 
lift some mountain and filled the 
operating amphitheater with 
shrieking echoes. And all the time 
the thousand eyes of the mnemonic eraser flickered in swift 
patterns, a silent measure of the 
cells and circuits of his mind. 

Abruptly the tiny red counting 
lights went off, a red beam glowed 
with a burr of warning. Someone 
said, "Now!" The mind of Bill 
Walden flashed along a wire as 

SI 



electrical energy and, converted 
en. the control panel into mechanical energy, it spun a small ratchet counter. 

"Please sit down/* the professor said to the shaken students. 
"The drug that has kept the other 
personality immobilized in being 
counteracted by this next injection. Now that the sickly personality has been d'^sipated, the 
healthy one can be brought back 
rapidly. 

"As you are aware, the synapse 
Operates on the binary 'yes-no* 
choice system of an electronic 
calculator. All synapses which 
were involved in the diseased personality have now been reduced 
to an atypical, uniform threshold. 
Thus they can be re-educated in 
new patterns by the healthy personality remaining . . . There, 
you see the countenance of the 
healthy personality appearing." 

TT WAS Conrad Manz who 
* looked up at them with a wry 
grin. He rotated his shoulders to 
loosen them. "How many of you 
pushed old Bill Walden tiround? 
He left me with some sore muscles. Well, I did that often enough 
to him . . 

Major Grey stood over him, 
face sick and white with the horror of what he had seen. "According to law, Mr. Manz, you and 
your wife are entitled to 6ve rest 
days on your next shift. When 



they are over, you will, of course, 
report for suspended animation 
for r/hat would have been your 
hyperalter's shift." 

Conrad Manz's grin shrank 
and vanished. "Would have been? 
Bill iz — gone?*' 

"Yes." 

"I never thought I'd miss him." 
Conrad looked as sick as Major 
Grey felt. "It makes me feel — I 
don't know if I can explain it — 
sort of amputated. As though 
something's wrong with me because everybody else has an alter 
and I don't. Did the poor son of 
a straitjacket suffer much?" 

"I'm afraid he did." 

Conrad Manz lay still for a 
moment with his eyes closed and 
his mouth thin with pity and remorse. "What will happen to 
Helen?" 

"She'll be all right," Major 
Grey said. "There will be Bill's 
insurance, naturally, and she 
won't have much trouble finding 
another husband. That kind never 
seems to." 

"Five rest days?" Conrad repeated. "Is that what you said?" 
He sat up and swung his lejs off 
the table, and he was grinning 
again. "I'll get in a whole shift 
of jet-skiing! No, wait — I've got 
a date with the wife of a friend 
of mine out at the rocket grounds. 
I'll take Clara out there; she'll 
like some of the men," 

Major Grey nodded abstract



 



edly. "Good idea." He shook 
hands with Conrad Manz, wished 
him fun on his rest shift, and 
left. 

Taking a helicopter back to his 
city, Major Grey thought of his 
own hyperalter, Ralph Singer. 
He'd often wished that the silly 
fool could be erased. Now he 
wondered how it would be to have 
only one personality, and, wondering, realized that Conrad 
Manz had been right — it would 
be like amputation, the shameful 
distinction of living in a schizophrenic society with no alter. 

No, Bill Walden had. been 
wrong, completely wrong, both 
about drugs and being split into 



two personalities. What one made 
up in pleasure through not taking drugs was more than lost in 
the suffering of conflict, frustration and hostility. And having an 
alter — any kind, even one as useless as Singer — meant, actually, 
nor being alone. 

Major Grey parked the helicopter and found a shifting station. He took off his makeup, addressed and mailed his clothes, 
and waited for the shift to come. 

It was a pretty wonderful society he lived in, he realized. He 
wouldn't trade it for the kind Bill 
Walden had wanted. Nobody in 
his right mind would.

OPERATION 
DISTRESS 

By LESTER DEL RAY 



BILL ADAMS was halfway 
back from Mars when he 
noticed the red rash on 
his hands. He'd been reaching for 
one of the few remaining tissues 
to cover a sneeze, while scratching vigorously at the base of his 
neck. Then he saw the red soot, 
and his hand halted, while all 



desire to sneeze gasped out of 
him. 

He sat there, five feet seven 
inches of lean muscle and 
bronzed skin, sweating and staring, while the blond hair on the 
back of his neck seemed to stand 
on end. Finally he dropped his 
hand and pulled himself careful

ly erect. The cabin in the spaceship was big enough to permit 
turning around, but not much 
more, and with the ship cruising 
without power, there was almost 
no gravity to keep him from 
overshooting his goal. 

He found the polished plate 
that served as a mirror and studied himself. His eyes were puffy, 
his nose was red, and there were 
other red splotches and marks on 
hts face. 

Whatever it was. he had it bad! 

Pictures went through his head, 
all unpleasant. He'd been only a 
kid when the men came back 
from the South Pacific in the 
last war; but an uncle had spent 
years dying of some weird disease that the doctors couldn't 
identify. That had been from 
something caught on Earth. What 
would happen when the disease 
was from another planet? 

It was ridiculous. Mars had no 
animal life, and even the thin 
lichenlike plants were sparse and 
tiny. ^ man couldn't catch a 
disease from a plant. Even horses 
didn't communicate their ills to 
men. Then Bill remembered gangrene " and cancer, which could 
attack any life, apparently. 

He went back to the tiny Geiger-Muller counter, but there was 
no sign of radiation from the big 
atomic motor that powered the 
ship. He stripped his clothes 
off, spotting more of the red 

OPERATION DISTRESS 



marks breaking out, but finding 
no sign of parasites. He hadn't 
really believed it, anyhow. That 
wouldn't account for the sneezing and sniffles, or the puffed 
eyes and burning inside his nose 
and throat. 

Dust, maybe? Mars had been 
dusty, a waste of reddish sand 
and desert silt that made the Sahara seem like paradise, and it 
had settled on his spacesuit, to 
come in through the airlocks with 
him. But if it contained some irritant, it should have been worse 
on Mars than now. He could remember nothing annoying, and 
he'd turned on the tiny, compact 
little static dust traps, in any 
case, before leaving, to clear the 
air. 

He went back to one of the 
traps now, and ripped the cover 
off it. 

The little motor purred briskly. 
The plastic rods turned against 
fur brushes, while a wiper cleared 
off any dust they picked up. 
There was no dust he could see; 
the traps had done their work. 

Some plant irritant, like poison 
ivy? No, he'd always worn his 
suit — Mars had an atmosphere, 
but it' wasn't anything a man 
could breathe long. The suit was 
put on and off with automatic 
machine grapples, so he couldn't 
have touched it. 

The rash seemed to get worse 
on his body as he looked at it. 

61 



Thir time, he tore one of the tissues in quarters as he sneezed. 
The little supply was almost 
gone; there was never space 
enough for much beyond essentials in a spaceship, even with 
the new atomic drive. As he looked for spots, the burning in his 
nose seemed to increase. 

He dropped back to the pilot 
seat, cursing. Two months of being cramped up in this cubicle, 
sweating out the trip to Mars 
without knowing how the new 
engine would last : three weeks 
on Mars, mapping frantically to 
cover all the territory he could, 
and planting little flags a hundred miles apart; now a week on 
the trip back at high acceleration most of the way — and this! 
He'd expected adventure of some 
kind. Mars, though, had proved 
as interesting as a sandpile, and 
even the "canals" had proved to 
be only mineral striations, invisible from the ground. 

He looked for something to do, 
but found nothing. He'd developed his films the day before, 
after carefully cleaning the static 
traps and making sure the air 
was dust-free. He'd written up 
the accounts. And he'd ■ been 
coasting along on the hope of 
getting home to a bath, a beer, 
and a few bull sessions, before 
he began to capitalize on being 
the first man to reach another 
planet beyond the Moon. 



He cut on full acceleration 
again, more certain of his motors 
than of himself. He'd begun to 
notice the itching yesterday; today he was breaking out in the 
rash. How long would whatever 
was coming take? Good God, he 
might die — from something as 
humiliating and undramatic as 
this! 

It hadn't hit him before, fully. 
There was no knowing about diseases from other planets. Men 
had developed immunity to the 
germs found on Earth; but just 
as smallpox had proved so fatal 
to the Indians and syphilis to 
Europe when they first hit, there 
was no telling how wildly this 
might progress. It might go away 
in a day, or it might kill him 
just as quickly. 

He was figuring his new orbit 
on a tiny calculator. In two days 
at this acceleration, he could 
reach radar-distance of Earth: in 
four, he could land. The tubes 
might burn out in continuous firing. But the other way, he'd be 
two weeks making a landing, and 
most diseases he could remember 
seemed faster than that. 

Bill wiped the sweat off his 
forehead, scratched at other 
places that were itching, and 
stared down at the small disk of 
Earth. There were doctors there 
— and, brother, he'd need them 
fast! 

Things were a little worse 




 



when the first squeals came from 
the radar two days later. He'd 
run out of tissues, and his nose 
was a continual drip, while 
breathing seemed almost impossible. He was running some fever, too, though he had no way 
of knowing how much. 

He cut his receiver in, punched 
out the code on his key. The receiver pipped again at him, bits 
of message getting through, but 
unclearly. There was no response 
to his signals. He checked his 
chronometer and flipped over the 
mtcropages of his Ephemeris; the 
big radar at Washington was still 
out of line with him, and the 
signals had to cut through too 
much air to come clearly. It 
should be good in another hour. 

But right now, an hour seemed 
longer than a normal year. He 
checked the dust tray again, tried 
figuring out other orbits, managed to locate the Moon, and 
scratched. Fifteen minutes. There 
was no room for pacing up and 
down. He pushed the back down 
from the pilot seat, lowered the 
table, and pulled out his bunk; 
he remade it, making sure all the 
corners were perfect. Tben he 
folded it back and lifted the 
table and seat. That took less 
than five minutes. 

His hands were shaking worse 
when the automatic radar signals 
began to come through more 
clearly. It wasn't an hour, but he 



could wait no longer. He opened 
the key and began to send. It 
would take fifteen seconds for 
the signal to reach Earth, and another quarter minute for an answer, even if an operator was on 
duty. 

Half a minute later, he found 
one was. "Earth to Mars Rocket 
I. Thank God, you're ahead of 
schedule. If your tubes hold out, 
crowd them. Two other nations 
have ships out now. The U. N. 
has ruled that whoever comes 
back first with mapping surveys 
can claim the territory mapped. 
We're rushing the construction, 
but we need the ship for the second run if we're to claim our fair 
territory. Aw, hell — congratula^ 
tions!" 

He'd started hammering at his 
key before they finished, giving 
the facts on the tubes, which 
were standing up beyond all ex-, 
pectations. "And get a doctor 
ready — a bunch of them," he finished. "1 seem to have picked up 
something like a disease." 

There was a long delay before 
an answer came this time — more 
than five minutes. The hand on. 
the key was obviously different* 
slower and not as steady. "What 
symptoms, Adams? Give all details!" 

He began, giving all the information he had, from the first 
itching through the rash and the 
fever. Again, longer this time, the 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



main station hesitated. 

"Anything I can do about it 
now?" Bill asked, finally. "And 
how about having those doctors 
ready?" 

"We're checking with Medical," the signals answered, 
"We're . . . Here's their report. 
Not enough data — could be anything. Do2ens of diseases like 
that. Nothing you can do, except 
try salt water gargle and spray; 
you've got stuff for that. Wash 
off rash with soap and hot water, 
followed by some of your hypo. 
We'll get a medical kit up to the 
Moon for you." 

He let that sink in, then clicked back: "The Moon?" 

"You think you can land here 
with whatever you've got, man? 
There's no way of knowing how 
contagious it is. And keep an 
hourly check with us. If you 
pass out, we'll try to get someone out in a Moon rocket to pick 
you up. But we can't risk danger 
of infecting the whole planet. 
You're quarantined on the Moon 
— we'll send up landing instructions later — not even for Luna 
Base, but where there will be no 
chance of contamination for others. You didn't really expect to 
come back here, did you, Adams?" 

He should have thought of it. 
He knew that. And he knew that 
the words from Earth weren't as 
callous as they sounded. Down 



there, men would be sweating 
with him, going crazy trying to 
do something. But they were 
right. Earth had to be protected 
first; Bill Adams was only one 
out of two and a half billions, 
even if he had reached a planet 
before any other man. 

Yeah, it was fine to be a hero. 
But heroes shouldn't menace the 
rest of the world. 

Logically, he knew they were 
right. That helped him get his 
emotions under control. "Where 
do you want me to put down?" 

"Tycho. It isn't hard to spot 
for radar-controlled delivery of 
supplies to you, but it's a good 
seven hundred miles from Lunar 
Base. And look — we'll try to get 
a doctor to you. But keep us informed if anything slips. We need 
those maps, if we can find a way 
to sterilize 'em." 

"Okay," h e acknowledged. 
"And tell the cartographers there 
are no craters, no intelligence, 
and only plants about half an 
inch high. Mars stinks." 

They'd already been busy, he 
saw, as he teetered down on his 
jets for a landing on Tycho. 
Holding control was the hardest 
job he'd ever done. A series of 
itchings cropped out just as the 
work got tricky, when he could 
no longer see the surface, and 
had to go by feel. But somehow 
he made it. Then he relaxed and 
began an orgy of scratching. 



*4 




 



And he'd thought there was 
something romantic about being 
a hero! 

The supplies that had already 
been sent up by the superfast 
unmanned missiles would give 
him something to do, at least. 
He moved back the two feet 
needed to reach his developing 
tanks and went through the process of spraying and gargling. It 
was soothing enough while it 
went on, but it offered only momentary help. 

Then his stomach began showing distress signs. He fought 
against it, tightening up. It did 
no good. Hts hasty breakfast of 
just black coffee wanted to come 
Up — and did, giving him barely 
time to make the little booth. 

He washed his mouth out and 
grabbed for the radar key, banging out a report on this. The doctors must have been standing by 
down at the big station, because 
there was only a slight delay 
before the answering signal came: 
"Any blood?" 

Another knot added itself to 
his intestines. "I don't know — 
don't think so, but I didn't look." 

"Look, next time. We're trying to get this related to some of 
the familiar diseases. It must 
have some relation — there are 
only so many ways a man can 
be sick. We've got a doctor coming over, Adams. None on the 
Moon, but we're shipping him 



through. He'll set down in about 
nine hours. And there's some 
stuff to take on the supply missiles. Ma y not help, but we're 
trying a mixture of the antibU 
otics. Also some ACS and anodynes for the itching and rash* 
Hope they work. Let us know 
any reaction." 

Bill cut off. He'd have to try. 
They were as much in the dark 
about this as he was, but they 
had a better background for 
guessing and trial and error. And 
if the bugs in him happened to 
like tachiomycetin, he wouldn't 
be too much worse off. Damn it, 
had there been blood? 

He forced his mind off it, 
climbed into his clothes and then 
into the spacesuit that hung from 
the grapples. It moved automatically into position, the two halves 
sliding shut and sealing from outside. The big gloves on his hands 
were too clumsy for such operations. 

Then he went bounding across 
the Moon. Halfway to the supplies he felt the itching come 
back, and he slithered and wriggled around, trying to scratch his 
skin against his clothing. It didn't 
help much. He was sweating 
harder, and his eyes were watering. He manipulated the little 
visor-cleaning gadget, trying to 
poke his face forward to brush 
the frustration tears from his 
eyes. He couldn't quite reach it. 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



There were three supply mis- They were really shooting the 
siles, each holding about two nun- pharmacy at him. He injected 
dred pounds, Earth weight. He himself, swallowed things, rubtied them together and slung bed himself down with others, 
them over his back, heading to- and waited. Whatever they'd 
ward his ship. Here they weighed given him didn't offer any immeonly a hundred pounds, and with diate help. He began to feel 
his own weight and the suit add- worse. But on contacting Earth 
ed, the whole load came to little by radar, he was assured that 
more than his normal weight on that might be expected. 
Earth. 

He tried shifting the supplies 
around on his back, getting them 
to press against the spots of torment as he walked. It simply unbalanced him, without really relieving the itching. Fortunately, 
though, his eyes were clearing a 
little. He gritted his teeth and 
fought back through the powdery pumice surface, kicking up 
clouds of dust that settled slowly but completely — though the 
gravity was low, there was no 
air to hold them up. 

Nothing had ever looked better than the airlock of the ship. 
He let the grapples hook the suit 
off him as soon as the outer seal 
was shut and went into a whirling dervish act. Aches and pains 
could be stood — but itching! 

Apparently, though, the spray 
and gargle had helped a little, 
since his nose felt somewhat 
clearer and his eyes were definitely better. He repeated them, 
and then found the medical supplies, with a long list of instructions.

"We've got another missile 
coming, with metal foil for the 
maps and photos — plus a small 
copying camera. You can print 
them right on the metal, seal that 
in a can, and leave it for the 
rocket that's bringing the doctor. 
The pilot will blast over it — that 
should sterilize it— and pick it up 
when it cools." 



Bill swore, but he was in his 
suit when the missile landed, 
heading out across the pumicecovered wastes toward it. The 
salves had helped the itching a 
little, but not much. And his nose 
had grown worse again. 

He jockeyed the big supply 
can out of the torpedo-shaped 
missile, packed it on his back, 



OPERATION DISTRESS

and headed for his ship. The 
itching was acting up as he sweated — this made a real load, about 
like packing a hundred bulky 
pounds over his normal Earth 
weight through the soft drift of 
the pumice. But his nose was 
clearing again; it was apparently 
becoming cyclic. He'd have to 
relay that information back to 
the medics. And where were they 
getting a doctor crazy enough to 
take a chance with him? 

He climbed out of the suit and 
went through the ritual of 
scratching, noticing that his fever had gone up, and that his 
muscles were shaking. His head 
seemed light, as if he were in for 
a spell of dizziness. They'd be 
interested in that, back on Earth, 
though it wouldn't do much good. 
He couldn't work up a clinical 
attitude about himself. AH he 
wanted was a chance to get over 
this disease before it killed him. 

He dragged out the photo and 
copying equipment, under a red 
light. It filled what little space 
was left in his cubbyhole cabin. 
Then he swore, gulping down 
more of the pills where they 
were waiting for him. The metal 
sheets were fine. They were excellent. The only thing wrong 
was that they wouldn't fit his 
developing trays — and they were 
tough enough to give him no way 
of cutting them to size. 

He stuffed them back in their 

** 



container and shoved it into the 
airlock. Then his stomach kicked 
up again. He couldn't see any 
blood in the result, but he 
couldn't be sure — the color of the 
pills might hide traces. He flushed 
it down, his head turning in circles, and went to the radar. This 
time he didn't even wait for a 
reply; let them worry about their 
damned maps. They could send 
cutting equipment with the doctor and pick up the things later. 
They could pick up his corpse 
and cremate it at the same time, 
for all he cared right now. 

He yanked out his bunk and 
slumped into it, curling up as 
much as the itching would permit. And finally, for the first time 
in over fifty hours, he managed 
to doze off, though his sleep was 
full of nightmares. 

It was the sound of the bullthroated chemical rocket that 
brought him out of it — the sound 
traveling along the surface 
through the rocks and up through 
the metal ship, even without air 
to carry it. 

He could feel the rumble of 
its takeoff later, but he waited 
long after that for the doctor. 
There was no knock on the port. 
Finally he pulled himself up from 
the bunk, sweating and shaken, 
and looked out. 

The doctor was there — or at 
least a man in a spacesuit was. 
But somebody had been in a frur
t A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



ry for volunteers, and given the 
man no basic training at all. The 
figure would pull itself erect, 
make a few strides that were all 
bounce and no progress, and then 
slide down into the pumice. 
Moon-walking was tricky until 

you learned how. 

Bill sighed, scratching unconsciously, and made his way somehow out to his suit, climbing into 
it. He paused for a final good 
scratch, and then the grapples 
took over. This time, he stumbled also as he made his way 
across the powdery rubble. But 
the other man was making no 
real progress at all. 

Bill reached him, and touched 
helmets long enough to issue simple instructions through metal 
sound conduction. Then he managed to guide the other's steps; 
there had been accounts of the 
days of learning spent by the 
first men on the Moon, but it 
wasn't that bad with an instructor to help. The doctor picked up 
as they went along. Bill's legs 
were buckling under him by then, 
and the itches were past endurance. At the end, the doctor was 
hrlping him. But somehow they 
made the ship, and were getting 
out of the suits — Bill first, then 
the doctor, using the grapples 
under Bill's guidance. 

The doctor was young, and obviously scared, but fighting his 
fear. He'd been picked for his 



smallness to lighten the load on 
the chemical rocket, and his little face was intent. But he managed a weak grin. 

"Thanks, Adams, I'm Doctor 
Ames — Ted to you. Get onto that 
cot. You're about out on your 
feet." 

The test he made didn't take 
long, but his head was shaking 
at the conclusion. 

"Your symptoms make no 
sense," he summarized. "I've got 
a feeling some are due to one 
thing, some to another. Maybe 
we'll have to wait until I come 
down with it and compare notes."' 

His grin was wry, but Bill was 
vaguely glad that he wasn't trying any bedside manner. There 
wasn't much use in thanking the 
man for Volunteering — Ames had 
known what he was up against, 
and he might be scared, but his 
cfeurage was above thanks. 

"What about the maps?" Bill 
asked. "They tell you?" 

"They've left cutters outside. 
I started to bring them. Then the 
pumice got me — I couldn't stand 
upright in it. They'll pick up the 
maps later, but they're important. The competing ships will 
claim our territory if we don't 
file first." 

He knocked the dust off his instrument, and wiped his hands. 
Bill looked down at the bed to 
see a fine film of Moon silt there. 
They'd been bringing in too much 



OPERATION DISTRESS 



on the suits — it was too fine, and 
the traps weren't getting it fast 
enough. 

He got up shakily, moving toward the dust trap that had been 
running steadily. But now it was 
out of order, obviously, with the 
fur brushes worn down until they 
could generate almost no static 
against the rod. He groped into 
the supplies, hoping there would 
be replacements. 

Ames caught his arm. "Cut it 
out, Adams. You're in no shape 
for this. Hey, how long since 
you've eaten?" 

Bill thought it over, his head 
thick. "I had coffee before I 
landed." 

Doctor Ames nodded quickly. 
"Vomiting, dizziness, tremors, excess sweating — what did you expect, man? You put yourself under this strain, not knowing what 
comes next, having to land wifch 
an empty stomach, skipping 
meals and loading your stomach 
wiUh pills — and probably no 
sleep! Those symptoms are perfectly normal." 

He was at the tiny galley 
equipment, fixing quick food as 
he spoke. But his face was still 
sober. He was probably thinking 
of the same thing that worried 
Bill — an empty stomach didn't 
make the itching rash, the runny 
nose and eyes, and the general 
misery that had begun the whole 
thing. 



He sorted through the stock 
of replacement parts, a few fieldsistors, suit wadding, spare 
gloves, cellophane -wrapped gadgets. Then he had it. Ames was 
over, urging him toward the cot, 
but he shook him off. 

"Got to get the dust out of 
here — dust'Il make the itching 
worse. Moon dust is sharp, Doc. 
Just install new brushes . . . 
Where are those instructions? 
Yeah, insert the cat's fur brushes 
under the . . . Cat's fur? Is that 
what they use, Doc?" 

"Sure. It's cheap and generates static electricity. Do you expect sable?" 

Bill took the can of soup and 
sipped it without tasting or thinking, his hand going toward a 
fresh place that itched. His nose 
began running, but he disregarded it. He still felt lousy, but 
strength was flowing through 
him, and life was almost good 
again. 

He tossed the bunk back into 
its slot, lifted the pilot's stool, 
and motioned Ames forward. 
"You operate a key — hell, I am 
getting slow. You can contact 
Luna Base by phone, have them 
relay. There. Now tell 'em I'm 
blasting off pronto for Earth, and 
ril be down in four hours with 
their plans." 

"You're crazy." The words 
were flat, but there was desperation on the little doctor's face. 




 



He glanced about hastily, taking 
the microphone woodenly. "Adams, they'll have an atomic bomb 
up to blast you out before you're 
near Earth. They've got to protect themselves. You can't . . ." 

Bill scratched, but there was 
the beginning of a grin on his 
face. "Mope, I'm not delirious 
now, though I damn near cracked 
up. You figured out half the 
symptoms. Take a look at those 
brushes — cat's fur brushes — and 
figure what they'll do to a man 
who was breathing the air and 
who is allergic to cats! All I ever 
had was some jerk in Planning 
who didn't check my medical 
record with trip logistics! I never 
had these symptoms until I unzipped the traps and turned *em 
on. It got better whenever I was 
in the suit, breathing canned air. 
We should have known a man 
can't catch a disease from 
plants." 

The doctor looked at him, and 



at the fur pieces he'd thrown 
into a wastebin, and the whiteness ran from his face. He was 
seeing his own salvation, and t lie 
chuckle began weakly, gathering 
strength as he turned to the microphone. 

"Cat asthma — simple allergy. 
Who'd figure you'd get that in, 
deep space? But you're right. 
Bill. It figures." 

Bill Adams nodded as he 
reached for the controls, and the 
tubes began firing, ready to take 
them back to Earth. Then he 
caught himself and swung to the 
doctor. 

"Doc," he said quickly, "just 
be sure and tell them this isn't 
to get out. If they'll keep still 
about it, so will I." 

He'd make a hell of a hero on 
Earth if people heard of it, and 
he could use a little of a hero's 
reward. 

No catcalls, thanks.

THE Ambassador from Outer Space sprang to his feet, 
taking Jerry's extended 




hand in a firm, warm grasp. Jerry 
had been prepared for almost 
anything — a scholarly brontosaurus, perhaps, or an educated 
squid or giant caterpillar with 
telepathic powers." But the Ambassador didn't even have antennae, gills, or green hair. He was 
a completely normal and even 
handsome human being. 

"Scotch? Cigar?" the Ambassador offered cordially. "How can 
I help you, Mr. Jergins?" 

Studying him, Jerry decided 
there was something peculiar 
about this extraterrestial, after

all He was too perfect. His shave 
was too close, his skin so unblemished as to suggest waxworks. Every strand of his distinguished iron-gray hair was impeccably placed. The negligent 
and just-right drape of his 
clothes covered a body shaped 
like a Sixth Century B.C. piece 
of Greek sculpture. No mere human could have look so unruffled, 
so utterly groomed, at three 
o'clock in the afternoon, in a 
busy office. A race, Jerry wondered, capable of taking any 
shape at will, in mimicry of the 
indigenous race of any planet? 

'"You can help me, but I'm not 
sure you will" Jerry said. "The 
rumor is that you won't do anything to ease this buyers* strike 
you started on Earth." 

The Ambassador smiled. 
"You're a man who's hot used 
to taking no for an answer, I 
gather. What's your proposition?" 

"I'd like to contact some of the 
firms on the Federated Planets, 
show them how I could promote 
their merchandise on Earth. 
Earth is already clamoring for 
their goods. To establish a medium of exchange, we'd have to run 
simultaneous campaigns,- promoting Earth merchandise on other 
planets." 

"That would be difficult, even 
fof a man of your promotional 
ability," the Ambassador said 
wirmingly. "You see, Earth is the 



only planet we've yet discovered 

where advcrtising^-or promotion, 
to use the broader term — exists 
as a social and economic force." 

"How in hell can anybody do 
business without it?" Jerry demanded. 

"We don't do business in the 
sense you mean. Don't mistake 
me," the Ambassador added 
hastily, "we don't have precisely 
a communal economy, either. Our 
very well defined sense of ethics 
in regard to material goods is 
something I find impossible to 
describe in any Earth language. 
It's quite simple, so simple that 
you have to grow up with it to 
understand it. Our whole attitude 
toward material goods is conditioned by the Matter Repositor." 

"That gadget!" Jerry said bitterly. "It was when you first mentioned it before the U.N. Assembly that all this trouble on Earth 
started. Everybody and his brother hopes that tomorrow he can 
buy a Matter Repositor, and never have to buy anything again. I 
came here mostly to ask you 
whether it's really true, that if 
you have one of those dinguses, 
you can bring anything you want 
into your living room.'" 

"You can. In practice, of 
course, repositing just anything 
that took your fancy would produce economic anarchy." 

"Let's put it this way," Jerry 
persisted. "Home appliances were

my biggest accounts. Now, when 
we try to sell a refrigerator, the 
prospect says she's saving her 
cash till Matter Repositors get on 
the Earth market. She plans to 
reposit a refrigerator — not from 
her neighbor's kitchen, because 
that would be stealing — but from 
the factory. If the factory goes 
bust, people figure the government will have to subsidize building appliances. Now, could she 
really reposit a refrigerator?" 

"She could. But she wouldn't 
want to." 

"Why not?" Jerry asked, puzzled. 

"If she conceived an illogical 
and useless desire for food refrigeration, she would simply reposit a block of cold, air from, 
say, the North Pole." 

"Oh, fine!" Jerry said sarcastically. "That would cause more 
unemployment in the refrigerator 
industry than repositing them 
without paying for them! But 
what do you mean about food refrigeration being illogical and 
useless?" 

"Well, in a storage warehouse, 
there might be some reason for 
food preservation. But you don't 
need cold or canning. Why not 
j ust reposit the bacteria that 
cause the food to deteriorate ? 
There's no need to store food in 
a home equipped with a Matter 
Repositor. You simply reposit one 
meal at a time. Fruits and vege


tables direct from tree or field. 
Meat from a slaughterhouse, since 
it isn't humane to remove a pound 
of steak from a live steer. But 
even this is needless." 

"Why?" Jerry bafflcdly wanted ' 
to know. 

"To free the maximum amount 
of the effort of thinking beings 
for non-material activities, each 
consumer can reposit the chemical elements of the food, synthesize his meal on the table. He 
can even reposit these elements 
directly into his stomach, or, to 
by -pass the effort of digestion, 
into his bloodstream as glycogen 
and amino acids." 

"So refrigerators would be as 
dead an item as kerosene lamps 
in a city wired for electricity," 
Jerry agreed unhappily. "Suppose 
Mrs. Housewife, not needing a 
refrigerator, reposits a washing 
machine. The point I'm driving at 
■ — is there any practical way to 
compensate the factory, give it an 
incentive to produce more washing machines, without dragging 
in government control?" 

"Why should the factory, produce more washing machines? 
Who would want one? The housewife would simply reposit the 
dirt from her clothes into her 
flowerbed, without using water 
and soap. Or, more likely, reposit new clothes with different 
colors, fabrics, and styles. The 
Matter Repositor would eliminate 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



75 



textile mills and clothing factories. Earth's oceans have vast 
enough, quantities of seaweed to 
eliminate the growing of cotton, 
wool, or flax. Or. again, you could 
reposit the chemical elements, 
either from the soil or from seawater." 

Jerry pondered the extensive 
implications of these revelations. 
Finally he said, "What it boils 
down to is this. All Earth's bustling material activity, all the logging and construction, the mining 
and manufacturing, the planting 
'and fishing, the printing and postal service, the great transportation 
and shipping effort, the cleaning 
^nd painting, the sewage disposal, 
even the bathing and self-adornment, consist, when you analyze 
them, of one process only — putting something hop* where you 
don't want it to where you do. 
There's, not one single, solitary 
Earth invention or service left to 
advertise!" 

"Nothing," the Ambassador 
agreed. "Which is exactly why 
advertising has not developed on 
the Federated Planets. You're 
fortunate that Earth doesn't have 
Matter Repository. You'd be out 
of a job if it did." 

"Oh, no!" Jerry said. "I could 
still advertise the gadget to end 
all gadgets — the Matter Repositor 
itself. I know other people have 
Vsked you this before, but could 
'an Earth company get a franchise 



to import those machines here, or 
the license rights to manufacture 
them?" 

"No," the Ambassador said, 
briefly and definitely. 

"Mr. Ambassador/' Jerry protested, "you've gone to a lot of 
trouble to explain things you 
must already be tired of explaining to Earthmen, just so I personally could be sure they weren't 
merely rumors or misinterpretations. Now that I get down to the 
real point, you suddenly become 
blunt and unqualified. Why?" 

"Because there's a very serious 
question of ethics involved, wherever a more advanced civilization 
comes in contact with a relatively 
primitive one. For instance, when 
the white men came to America, 
the aborigines were introduced to 
gunpowder and firewater." 

"So you people are keeping 
Matter Repositors away from us, 
like a mama keeping candy away 
from a baby who's hollering for 
it, because it's not good for him! 
You'd pass up a chance to name 
your own price — " 

"The very way you phrase that 
remark indicates the danger. You 
regard personal gain as the 
strongest of motives, which means 
that Matter Repositors would be 
used for that, even by such unusually intelligent members of your 
race as yourself." 

"Don't softsoap me," Jerry said 
angrily. "Not after you just got 



?4 




 



through saying that we Earthlings are nothing but naked savages, compared to the high and 
mighty super-beings on other 
planets!" 

"I apologize for my phraseology," the Ambassador said. "With 
my limited command of your language — " 

"Your limited command, nuts! 
I suppose you supermen enjoy 
seeing us naked savages squirm. 
Why talk sanctimoniously about 
the damage you might do, when 
you know damn well the damage 
has already been done? Just the 
news that something as advanced 
as the Matter Repositor exists has 
sent unemployment to a new 
high, and the stock market to a 
new low. And you theorize about 
ethics, while denying us the only 
cure!" Jerry found himself fighting a nearly irresistible impulse 
to smash his fist into that tooperfect profile — which, he realized 
glumly, would only prove the 
Ambassador's point about savages. 

"Here, here," the Ambassador 
said benevolently, "let's have another drink. Then we'll see whether I can make it clear to you why 
the actual imjiortation of Matter 
Repositors would cause much 
more trouble on Earth than the 
announcement of their existence, 
bad as the effect of that has been. 
To begin with, I admit I made a 
wery serious error in mentioning 



the device at all before the U.N. 
Assembly. I intended merely to 
explain how I came here without 
a spaceship- After that, I was 
flooded with questions; I could 
no more avoid answering them 
than I could courteously avoid 
answering the questions you've 
been asking today." 

"You mean you super- beings 
actually admit you're human 
enough to make mistakes?" Jerry 
asked, somewhat moll i lied. 

"Of course we make mistakes. 
We try not to make the same one 
twice. You see, we once made the 
mistake of importing Matter Repositors to a planet whose natural 
resources and social concepts 
weren't adequate for the device. 
That was a long time ago, and 
they haven't recovered from the 
effects yet. Suppose a consignment of ten thousand Matter Repositors arrived on Earth tomorrow. Under your economic system, who would get them?" 

"The ten thousand people or 
corporations who had the most 
money to pay for them, I guess. 
Unless government agencies grabbed 'em." 

"Can you guarantee that of the 
ten thousand people on Earth who 
have the most money, not one is 
unscrupulous?" 

"Gosh, no!" Jerry said. "I don't 
think there's any doubt that to 
stay in business very long, a man 
or a company has to have a cer


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



77 



tain amount of business ethics. 
Nobody can gyp the public indefinitely. But a bank robber 
might have a lot of cash, or a 
confidence man, or a cluck with 
a big inheritance." 

"So, to be generous, let's assume that 9,999 of your wealthiest persons are so ethical that 
they would never make any profit 
at the expense of the general welfare. That leaves us one crook. 
What would he reposit first?" 

"Hmra . . . Maybe the gold at 
Fort Knox." 

"And what effect would that 
have on Earth*s business?" 

"I'm not quite sure," Jerry admitted. "I'm no shark on monetary theory, just the kind of largescale salesman who makes mass 
production possible. But it certainly wouldn't do the world situation any good." 

"Suppose, next, our crook holds 
the President of the United States 
for ransom. Since he doesn't need 
money, the ransom price might 
be laws which would grant him 
impunity for his crimes. If not, 
he could have an accomplice reposit him out of jail, or even out 
of the electric chair, before the' 
switch was pulled." 

"That's enough! I get the idea!" 
Jerry exclaimed. 

"Wait — there's a more important point. Suppose a government 
you consider the wrong government got hold of some of the ma


chines. First, of course, they'd reposit the world * stockpile of 
atomic bombs. Then they'd reposit disease bacteria into the 
bloodstreams of U.N. troops, officials, and civilian workers, and 
reposit all the ammunition out of 
U.N. guns. So long as there is one 
spark of nationalism left on 
Earth, so long as any country has 
an economic and political system 
they consider better than some 
other system, Matter Repositors 
would mean planetary self-destruction. Now do you see why I 
was blunt and unqualified?" 

"I do," Jerry said solemnly, 
"And I was a fool to fly off the 
handle when you called us savages. We are savages, I can see 
that now. And your people must 
be pretty damned godlike to be 
trusted with such an invention!" 

"Not at all. To a Micronesian 
bushman, the pilot who can be 
trusted with the power and speed 
of a B-29 seems a veritable god. 
But the pilot is only an ordinary 
Joe, very likely no more intelligent than the bushman- — he just 
had a different background. 
Fighting each other for necessities and luxuries, the process that 
you people call business competition, has so long been needless to 
our people that they would no 
more think of competitive gain 
than you would do an Indian 
harvest dance before you signed 
a contract. They aren't necessarily 



7« 




 



more intelligent or more virtuous 
than your people — they just have 
a different background." 

"You seem to have devoted a 
lot of study to the larceny in the 
Earthman's soul," Jerry put in. 
"What if we stole the secret from 
you, whether you think it wise to 
give it to us or not ? Suppose 
somebody swiped the blueprints, 
or copied a Repositor you brought 
with you for your own use?" 

The Ambassador smiled. "You 
might try to steal it. That's why 
[ didn't bring a Repositor with 
me, to save you people the trouble 
of a futile try." 

"Why futile?" 

"Well, the Matter Repositor is 
a simple device. Any child on the 
Federated Planets who had an 
education, say, equivalent to youj 
technical high school education, 
could build a working model, even 
without another Repositor to assist him. But Earth's best technicians couldn't build one, even 
with cither blueprints or a model 
to copy." 

"They couldn't, eh?" Jerry 
challenged, bristling again. "They 
managed to split atoms, transmute elements, do a few little 

, tricks like that." 

"I see I've been tactless again," 
the Ambassador said regretfully. 
"Just now. you readily conceded 

i that Earthmen are savages morally, but when I seem to cast aspersions on your mechanical abil


ity, it offends your racial vanity. 
All right, let's go back to the B-29 
pilot and the intelligent bushman. 
The internal combustion engine 
that powers the B-29 is a simple 
device in fundamental principle, 
isn't it?" 

"Sure," Jerry said. 

"Any high school boy who has 
taken a course in auto mechanics, 
who has the requisite machine 
tools, metals, casting equipment, 
and fuel, could build a working 
model of an internal combustion 
engine, couldn't he, even without 
ready-made parts?" 

"I f he wasn' t all thumbs, he 
could." 

"All right. Now suppose the 
B-29 is grounded in the jungle. 
The bushman is examining the 
engine. He's just as intelligent as 
the pilot, remember, but his environment hasn't produced an oil 
well, let alone a refinery. He has 
never seen a lathe or a micrometer. Hr has no mine, no smelter. 
He can't copy that B-29 engine 
by whittling wood or chipping 
stone, even if he's a born mechanical genius, and he can't run it on 
seawater. So he says the plane 
flies by magic. Put him in the 
pilot seat, and you'll admit it's 
practically inevitable that he'll 
crash.'" 

"Why do you take so much 
trouble to explain things?" Jerry 
asked wryly. "I should have my 
head examined for not under 


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



79 



standing it in the first place.** 

"Let's say I'm feebly trying to 
make amends for what my unfortunate slip of the tongue has 
done to your business." 

"You've brought me around to 
your way of thinking, Mr. Ambassador," Jerry said, recovering 
enough to carry the ball. "But it 
would be impossible to sell the 
public on the idea that they 
shouldn't have Repositors because 
they're too hot to handle. Statistics on auto accidents never 
convinced anybody that he didn't 
want a nice, shiny, new car. Nobody thinks he personally will 
fget killed in traffic — he's too 
smart. You can't convince a 
youngster he doesn't want candy 
before dinner; he thinks he knows 
better than his parents. But you 
can hide the candy, while putting 
an appetizing meal on the table." 

"Yes, except that I regrettably 
didn't hide the fact that the Matter Repositor exists." ^ 

"You sure didn't. And it puts 
you "ffh a spot, doesn't it? I don't 
imagine it will be much fun for 
you to report to your government 
that one ill-considered remark, 
made shortly after your arrival, 
upset Earth's economy." 

For the first time, the Ambassador's suavity was ruffled. Sweat 
stood out on his noble forehead. 
"I've been hoping the bad-effects 
would die down before I have to 
report," he confessed. 



"They won't die down by themselves. You know damned well 
they're getting worse and worse, 
as word - of - mouth advertising 
about the Matter Repositor 
spreads." Jerry leaned closer. 
"But you and I can get rid of 
those bad effects." 

"How?" 

"Well, I'll tell you. When I 
came to see you, I was pretty sure 
you'd turn me down cold on importing Matter Repositors. But I 
had an ace up my sleeve. I hoped 
you would admit that the reason, 
you've been stalling on selling 
Earth any Repositors is that you 
don't really have a practical one. 
I thought maybe rumors of the 
Repositor's powers had been vastly exaggerated. If you admitted 
that, I intended to publicize it to 
the limit. A campaign to convince 
Earthmen that you'd been kidding 
them would work, because it 
"plays on John Q. Public's conviction that he's pretty smart, too 
smart to believe all this gab about 
a gadget he's never seen. With 
your denial to back me up, I 
could put it across. It would be 
a lifesaving shot in the arm for 
Earth business." 

"You mean," the Ambassador 
said reflectively, "that if I call 
myself a liar — if I actually become a liar in so doing — I can 
patch up the damage I've done? 
That puts me in a difficult ethical 
position," 



to 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



"Not as difficult as the one 
you're in now. If it will make it 
easier for you, I can word your 
dental in a face-saving way, and 
have it ready for your signature 
Tuesday. You have a remarkable 
command of colloquial English, 
but even a diplomat using his 
native tongue can't juggle the 
connotations and inferences like 
an advertising man." 

"It's very kind of you to offer 
your professional skill in my behalf. I think I should pay you a 
fee for the copy." 

"Skip it," Jerry said generously, fingering the nickel and two 
pennies in his pocket. "A small 
token of my appreciation for the 
patience you've shown. What time 
Tuesday?" 

"Say two o'clock?" 

"Fine. But before I spend my 
time on this, you're not going to 
make the same deal with somebody else, are you?" 

"Deal? Did I make a'deal?" 

"What I mean, nobody else has 
approached you with the idea 
that Earth business would get 
back to normal if you would 
deny that a practical Matter Repositor exists? You'd say I have 
exclusive rights to the idea?" 

"Nobody has," the Ambassador 
said, "and I agree to give you 
exclusive rights." 

"Good! With your signed denial, I can raise the loot. I think 
the N.A.M. will go for it. The 



campaign will have to be wellfinanced, you see; the amount of 
space the news columns will give 
to your dental may be as much 
as they gave to your original 
statement, but that alone won't 
do the job. It's much harder to 
kill a notion that has penetrated 
the public mind than it is to implant one." 

iHE Ambassador indulged in ft 
chuckle. "I'm beginning to see 
daylight. My signed denial in 
your hands becomes a salable 
piece of merchandise, worth far 
more than I would pay you for a 
few lines of copy. Well, more 
power to you! Would it be out of 
place for me to contribute some of 
the funds for publicizing this denial?" 

"How much?" Jerry asked 
practically. 

"Well," the Ambassador explained, "I've had nothing reposited that I could avoid. But 
since your planet has a monetary 
exchange, I had to pay for my 
office help, lodging, and so on. 
Synthesizing coinage would have 
been counterfeiting, which is 
against your laws, so I merely 
had a moderate amount of uncoined gold reposited, and I sell 
it on the regular Earth market as 
I need funds. Gold has no particular value on the Federated Planets, of course. I could get whatever you" need, so long as it isn't 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



enough to disrupt the economy 
any more than — well, than I have 
already. Let's limit ourselves to 
an amount that could be accounted for by an unusually good year 
in mining." 

"Sold!" Jerry said happily. "I 
think I can struggle along on a 
million a month retainer. Plus the 
usual fifteen per cent on advertising space and printing, of 
course; I'll have an estimate on 
that for you Tuesday. Since you 
can finance the whole campaign 
yourself, we'll leave the N.A.M. 
out of it. That way I can spare 
you the humiliation of signing an 
outright denial. All you have to 
do from now on is to keep mum. 
Don't even admit that you're the 
angel financing this campaign; 
that would make it look phony. 
I'll assign you three personal public-relations men. on twenty-fourhour shift. All your public remarks arc to screen through 
them." 

"But how can I conceal my 
identity when I'm sponsoring the 
campaign?" the Ambassador objected. 

"That's easy. The ostensible 
Sponsor will be a dummy organisation called — um — the Consumers Fact Finding Board. Nobody 
but me needs to know who signs 
the checks.** 

"How long will this campaign 
Continue?" 

"I figure it'll take about six 



months to sell the public this particular bill of goods. Once we get 
business revived, the best thing 
is never to mention- the words 
Matter Repositor again, not even 
to deny its existence. The ultimate 
goal is to make people forget they 
ever heard of such a gadget. The 
more convincing I make it, the 
quicker I'll work myself out of a 
job." 

"1 should think you'd make it 
last as long as possible: that's why 
I asked you for a time-limit. Do 
you want to work yourself out of 
a .job?" 

"You bet I do! Then T can start 
selling a bigger item, launch a 
longer-term promotion, one that 
will last till Earth gets civilized, 
till I don't have anything more to 
sell. From what you say. that will 
take a lot longer than I'll live." 

"It may be none of my business, but what is this big item 
you prooose to sell next?" the 
Ambassador asked, curiously. 

"Earth," Jerry said. 

The Ambassador looked confused. "I'm afraid I don't understand." 

"Didn't you just get through 
telling me. in effect, that any of 
your people who came to Earth 
could have all the money they 
wanted to spend? Well, I'm going 
to fun advertising copy on the 
Federated Planets, and get them 
to come here and spend it." 

"But I also told you taat ad



 



vertising is unknown on the Federated Planets!" the Ambassador 
protested. 

"All the better. Your people, 
then, will have less sales resistance than an audience of Earth 
kindergarten kids, who have had 
spot com mere i a Is din ned into 
their ears since birth. The only 
problem is space and time," 

"The Matter Repositor has effectively solved the problems of 
space and time." 

"No, I mean space and time as 
«n advertising man uses those 
terms. Newspaper and magazine 
space, radio and TV time. Do you 
have any newspapers out there?" 

"We have very little you would 
classify as news. No wars, no 
stock market, no crime, no epidemics, no political mudslinging, 
few accidents. But we do have information bulletins, of course." 

"Fine! Besides that million a 
month retainer, I want an exclusive contract to run advertising 
copy in the information bulletins 
on the Federated Planets." 

"This is completely unprecedented!" 

"You want to get out of this 
mess you're in, don't you? I'm the 
boy who can get you out, and 
that's my price." 

"You drive a hard bargain, Mr, 
Jergins. Very well, I'll arrange it. 
But I'm getting you the contract 
only because I'm certain your 
excursion idea won't work. Oh, I 



know Earthmen want to visit the 
Federated Planets ; I've had 
plenty of requests. I've had to 
explain repeatedly that we must 
hold to our announced policy of 
no ambassador from Earth, and 
no exchange students, until Earth 
has completed a few more steps 
in the development of her civilization. But surely none of our people will come to Earth, aside from 
a few students of comparative 
civilizations. Our general public 
can view samples of your national 
costumes, automobiles, and so on, 
in the museums. I can't see why 
they should want to come here, 
while Earth is still in a primitive 
and dangerous stage." 

"You can't, eh? Well, you 
might be surprised, Mr. Ambassador, you might be surprised. For 
the time being,. just picture yourself as the pilot of that B-29, 
grounded on a primitive little 
island in space. You've met a 
poor, ignora nt bushman. He 
couldn't reproduce your plane to 
save his neck. He can't manufacture a single gadget you'd want to 
buy. Nevertheless, you're about 
to see a demonstration of a few 
tricks of survival that your supercivilized race has forgotten — or, 
rather, never knew. I think you'll 
cook up into a right tasty dish." 

POUR days later, the Better 
Business Bureau of Oskaloosa, Iowa, nabbed a question


THE PILOT AND THE 1USHMAN

able character who had accepted 
deposits from local businessmen, 
in return for elaborately printed 
but worthless contracts to deliver 
Matter Repositors. 

The warning flash crossed similar warnings from New Orleans, 
Reno, Milwaukee, and the Borough of Queens, with a particularly hysterical note injected by Los 
Angeles, where the populace had 
proved most susceptible to the 
bogus agents. The news of a national ring of confidence artists, 
capitalizing on people's desire for 
Matter Repositors, ran in all 
papers, of course. The editors as 
yet hadn't the faintest idea that 
they were printing carefully engineered publicity. 

Before he even got his space 
contracts lined up. Jerry had accomplished quite a feat. He had 
fixed things so that, if the Ambassador from Outer Space himself had changed his mind, and 
imported a cargo of genuine Matter Repositors, he would have had 
some trouble convincing people 
he wasn't a crook. 

In a record two weeks, the campaign proper was ready to roll. 
It was long on white space, and 
the copy was so short that, after 
glancing at it a few times, you 
found that ypu had involuntarily 
committed it to memory. In the 
center of blank pages in all major 
metropolitan newspapers appeared a small want-ad, stating that 



the Consumers Fact Finding 
Board had deposited with a New 
York bank the sum of one million dollars in cash, alter taxes, 
which would be paid to any person, terrestrial or extraterrestrial, 
who could produce a Matter Repositor capable of repositing an 
object weighing two pounds a distance of ten feet. 

The offer was repeated daily 
for a month, and from the second 
day forward, there was a large, 
red overprint, looking like a 
crayon scrawl, which said, "No 
Takers to Date who Can Deliver 
the Goods!" 

The idea was pounded into the 
public mind by carcards, billboards, direct mail, and annoying telephone solicitors, who got 
subscribers out of bathtub and 
bed to ask them whether they had 
a Matter Repositor around the 
house they wanted to sell for a 
million dollars. Skywriters by day 
and illuminated blimps by night 
made sure the literate could not 
escape the message. Radio and 
TV singing and cartoon commercials took care of the illiterate. 

No conclusions were drawn in 
the copy. Each "prospect" was left 
with the comfortable feeling that 
his own superior intellect and 
powers of deduction had supplied 
the answer. No Matter Repositor 
turned up for sale, so everyone 
was sure there was no such thing. 
The whole campaign, like other 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



advertising campaigns before it, 
depended on what people failed 
to consider. They neglected to realise that a million dollars would 
be a joke to the owner of a Matter Repositor, who could reposit 
ell the wealth on Earth, including 
the million in the New York bank, 
but would have no use for money, 
since he could reposit usable 
goods. The magic phrase "a million dol 1 ars' ' wa s a world wid e 
symbol for a!l desirable material 
things. It would have been almost 
heresy to reflect that even that 
much cash had no actual value. 

A S Jerry prdmised. the Ambassador didn't have to issue 
an official denial. His chief pub 1 
lie relations man quite truthfully 
admitted to reporters that the 
Ambassador had no Matter Repositor in his possession, a dispatch carried by all wire services, 
and snickered at by clever columnists. 

In basements and garages, persons of good, bad, and indifferent 
mechanical ability strove to earn 
the million. The U.S. patent office 
was inundated with models and 
drawings of unworkable devices. 
One of the Duke University subjects tried to patent his ability to 
influence the fall of dice mentally. 

During the next session of the 
Congress, Jerry's crack lobbyists 
raised a great howl about the 
shameful congestion in the Patent 



Office, not mentioning, of course, 
that they were employed by the 
man who had created the congestion, by offering a million dollars for a device he knew no 
Earthman could build. 

Another dummy organization, 
dubbed the Inventors Protective 
League, sponsored a bill to amend 
the act relating to perpetual motion machines. It passed, with an 
emergency clause, and, thereafter, 
devices purporting to reposit matter were not entitled to letters of 
patent. 

This just about clinched the 
deal, for the vast majority of people, who had never watched laws 
enacted, assumed that if something was in the law, there must 
be a good reason for it, unless, of 
course, it was anything like prohibition. 

A name band revived "The 
Thing," leaving the drumbeats 
out of the vocal refrain, and substituting, "Get out of here with 
that. Matter Repositor, before I 
call a cop!" Within six months, 
radio and TV comedians had 
worn out the joke. Even Goofy, 
My Friend Irma, Mrs. Ace, and 
Gracie Allen were too sophisticated to believe in Matter Repository. Gags about tnem dropped 
to the same low level as those 
about Brooklyn and joke-stealing 
comics. 

Although his appearance in 
public was liable to start boos and 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



catcalls, the Ambassador from 
Outer Space was duly grateful. 
He was spared the painful necessity of reporting his disastrous 
slip of the tongue to his government, for Earth economy was 
again on the upward spiral. Everybody was spending the money 
he'd been saving up for a Matter 
Kepositor. 

The Ambassador cheerfully 
paid the million-a-month retainer 
and the whopping space bills, but 
Jerry's greatest gain in the transaction was his agreement allowing 
him to run advertising in the 
Federated Planets information 
bulletins. The space didn't cost 
him a nickel. Yet he knew how 
to sell his exclusive rights to it 
for more money than any one 
Earth company had in its promotional budget. 

By the time the campaign debunking the Matter Repositor 
was ready to die a natural death, 
Jerry had started an organization 
of Earth businessmen, spearheaded by the Restaurant and Hotel 
Associations, and the transportation interests, to promote Earth as 
a primitive planet. The primitive 
aspects of Earth, Jerry predicted, 
would exert a powerful appeal on 
the citizens of the Federated Planets, who must be pretty bored 
with civilization, and badly in 
need of a vaction from too 
much perfection. 

This organization was not com


posed of dummies, by any means, 
but the businessmen joined Up 
with a vague idea that their hostelries were to be way-stations, 
that they were going to promote 
sightseeing tours to places they 
themselves would call primitive, 
that the human exhibits would 
consist of blanketed Navajos, 
Chinese coolies, hula girls, Voodoo dancers, and Eskimos. 

Jerry filled the biggest convention hall in Chicago, and, at the 
climax of the proceedings, dramatically drew back a velvet curtain, unveiling a huge painting of 
the symbol of the campaign — a 
masked bandit, wearing a slouch 
hat, clutching in a greedy hand a 
fat bag marked with a dollar sign. 
Below was blazoned the tasteful 
slogan, "Let the People of Earth 
Gyp You!" 

A chorus of outrage echoed in 
the rafters. It hadn't occurred to' 
the members that primitive exhibit A would be themselves; to 
wit. the genus Earth businessman; 
sub - species, go - getter. Jerry 
emerged from the resulting argument somewhat battered, but with 
what any experienced advertising 
man would recognize as a victory. 
His copy was to run in five per 
cent of the space, keyed. Now all 
he had to do was prove in dollars 
and cents that he knew more 
about mass sales psychology than 
his clients, which was, of course, 
a cinch. 




) 



In spite of translation into a 
more civilized language, Jerry's 
five per cent of the space outpulled the tamer ninety-five per 
cent by better than ten to one. 
Thereafter, his clients swallowed 
their pride, voted him a free hand, 
and contented themselves with 
raking in the shekels from a 
steady stream of handsome and 
rich extraterrestrial tourists. 

A FTER Jerry's tourist promotion had been running two 
years, the U.S. Post Office broke 
down and printed an issue of 
three-cent stamps commemorating the influx, showing the goddess Terra with welcoming arms 
open to the starred heavens. Jerry 
Jergins, the second advertising 
man in history to achieve the distinction of having Uncle Sam plug 
his product on a stamp, thereby 
entered the most select circles of 
his chosen profession. 

Jerry bought enough of the 
stamps to paper the walls of his 
swank and spacious penthouse 
offices, for the benefit of the 
swarm ef tourists who invaded the 
place daily during afternoon 
open-house hours. They all wanted to see an advertising agency; 
to them, this phenomenon was 
the essence of that primitive planet, Earth. Jerry had recorded a 
lecture on primitive Earth customs which issued from concealed 
loudspeakers, and filled display 



cases with exhibits of primitive 
Earth culture, emphasizing the 
aspects he felt these extraterrestrials would find most exotic. 

Considering the fact that Jerry 
had managed to learn little about 
the Federated Planets that was 
not utterly essential to the mechanics of his advertising campaign there, he had done a pretty 
good job of "getting on the customer's side of the counter." Every tourist Jerry talked to had 
been conditioned, by some unrevealed but apparently foolproof 
process, not to repeat the Ambassador's error of mentioning 
Matter Repositors, or other aspects of life on the Federated 
Planets that might cause repercussions on Earth. Even tourist 
children couldn't be bribed with 
lollypops. Tourists talked a great 
deal, in fluent idiomatic Earth 
English, yet somehow said very 
little. 

But Jerry knew at least one 
thing — he was stirring emotions 
that lay so deep under layers and 
flayers of civilization that these 
shining, perfect people hadn't 
known they were capable of feeling them, until they visited Earth. 
He was getting under their 
smooth skins, just as surely as 
the monotone of a Haitian drumbeat gets under the skin of a New 
Yorker. 

One of the display cases contained the working tools ©f gang


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 





 



sterism — sawed-off shotguns, 
blackjacks, a model of a bulletproof automobile, a news photo of 
the St. Valentine's Day massacre, 
a clipping about police payoffs 
from houses of gambling and 
prostitution, another about blindness resulting from wood alcohol. 
The shot-glasses of authentic antique bootleg gin that stood on 
top the cases were often smelled 
but never sampled. 

The second case showed a chart 
of fluctuations of the stock market, with an actual operating 
ticker in the middle. Sections of 
the tape were much in demand as 
souvenirs. But the photo of a 
smashed body of a once-wealthy 
man who jumped from his office 
window after losing his fortune 
caused the most comment. The 
tourists found it difficult to understand how this man could 
consider his life less important 
than his bank balance. 

The largest case contained 
models of war weapons, a lurid, 
painting of Pearl Harbor under 
aerial attack, another of the Hiroshima mushroom that ushered in 
the atomic age. There were gas 
masks, artificial limbs, a photo of 
a blinded veteran led by a Seeing-Eye dog. The tourists gaped 
at that exhibit with all the relish 
of Coney Island crowds visiting 
wax replicas of famous murder 
scenes. 

And along the entire 40-foot 



wall of the reception room, a 
photo-mural of a ragged, depression-era breadline brooded over 
the sleek heads of the beautifully 
dressed and elaborately fed tourists. 

On his way back to the office 
after lunch one day. Jerry spied 
a traffic -stopping cluster of humanity in the street outside one 
of the city's leading department 
stores. The crowd was gathered 
around a paddy-wagon. Never 
diffident, Jerry elbowed his way 
through the crush, to see two 
handsome and once well-groomed 
gentlemen getting a, mussing up 
from a couple of cops. The suspects, athletic-looking characters, 
were putting up a good fight, and 
the policemen didn't 1 like it. As 
Jerry watched, a billy descended 
on a well-barbered head, and suspect number one ceased resisting 
arrest. 

Jerry had come into contact 
with enough extraterrestrials by 
now so that he knew a tourist 
When he saw one. The male tourists gave- him a violent pain in the 
neck, but he felt somewhat responsible. He grabbed an elbow 
of the suspect who remained conscious. 

"Give me your name, bud, and 
I'll bail you out. What happened?" 

"Oh, we just took a few things 
off the counters in that store," the 
tourist answered. "You're very 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



kind, but we have plenty of 
money for bail, thanks. Or is it a 
bribe you're supposed to hand 
them?" 

"If you have plenty of money, 
why in hell didn't you buy the 
stuff, instead of stealing it?" 

"We just thought we'd have a 
bit of a lark. New experience and 
all that. When on Earth, do as 
the Earthmen do." 

"A lark!" the biggest policeman 
grunted. "We'll give you a lark, 
all tight! Get in there, you!" He 
implemented his command with 
a well-placed kick in the seat of a 
pair of expertly tailored pants, 
boosting the tourist into the paddy-wagon, where his unconscious 
friend had already been deposited. 

The siren screamed, dispersing 
the crowd in front of the police 
vehicle, and Jerry went on his 
way, chuckling. As he passed a 
hole-in-the-wall bar he knew, he 
decided to stop for a quick one, 
to settle the heavy feeling in his 
stomach that came from eating 
lobster Newburg" for lunch. It 
wasn't a place where you'd care 
to take a lady, but they served an 
honest ounce. 

As Jerry pushed through the 
old-fashioned swinging doors, a 
burst of sound greeted him. A 
whiskey baritone was rendering 
one of the unpublishable versions 
of "Christopher Columbo," to the 
accompaniment of a piano tinkle 
by the hired help. The customer 




was obviously from the other side 
of the tracks — from the other side 
of the Galaxy, in fact — and he 
Was leaning against the piano for 
the simple reason that he couldn't 
stand up. 

He wore a well-cut Californiastyle dinner jacket, and after all 
night and half the day, the white 
gabardine was no longer white. 
Several drinks had been spilled 
on the midnight-blue flannel trousers. Only a magnificent physique 
distinguished him from the Earth 
or garden variety of drunk. 

Jerry stood up to the bar, and 
as his eyes became accustomed to 




 




the dimness, he observed a touching — literally — scene being enacted in the darkest booth. An 
Earthside racetrack tout, whom. 
Jerry recognized as one of the 
habitues of the place, had a gorgeous female tourist backed into 
a corner. She had retreated as far 
as the wall permitted, but he had 
long since caught up. 

Her jaunty, elbow -length chin


chilla cape lay on the wet table. 
Her exquisitely simple strapless 
dinner dress of silver lame exposed arms and shoulders that 
were literally out of this world. 
The naked effect was relieved 
only by a diamond, platinum, and 
emerald choker. Jerry knew, 
though the racetrack tout probably didn't, that the priceless 
bauble was Repositor - synthe


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



$1 



sized, with an Earth museum 
piece as a model. 

It was a tossup whether the race 
track tout was more interested in 
the diamonds or the tempting 
flesh they adorned. The girl made 
no attempt to fight him off. The 
reason for her acquiescence was 
not far to seek. The glass before 
her contained the remains of a 
"Pink Lady," which tastes like 
an ice-cream soda and kicks like 
four Kentucky mules. 

She moved her left hand to pick 
up the glass, and Jerry caught the 
flash of a circlet of channel-set 
baguette diamonds on the third 
finger. He concluded that she was 
the wife of the whiskey baritone. 
That worthy seemed utterly unconcerned about the whole thing, 
so why should Jerry interfere? 

The racetrack tout left his con- ■ 
quest momentarily, walked over 
to the bar, handed the bartender 
a five-spot. Without comment, the 
bartender took down a key tagged 
13 from a hook, and the turf expert pocketed it. There was a 
dingy sign reading "Hotel" outside; Jerry had always supposed 
the floors above contained equally 
dingy furnished rooms. 
/ ' The beautiful tourist's silver 
heels mounted the back stairs unsteadily. The tout was half steering her, half supporting her. The 
man was sober enough to know 
exactly what he was doing. When 
she came back down those stairs, 



she would be minus not only her 
virtue, but her diamond necklace 
as well. 

"Oh, he knew the world was 
round-o, that sailors could be 
found-o," the whiskey baritone 
sang lustily. 

Jerry left the saloon with a 
bad taste in his mouth. As he 
passed through the electric-eye 
doorway of his office suite, he had 
the impression that the too perfect inhabitants of all the color 
advertising pages he had turned 
out in past years had suddenly 
come to life. Handsome tourists 
were moving, in chattering groups, 
from one display case to another. 

Their chatter, as usual, gave 
him few clues. He still harbored 
a suspicion that on their home 
planets, these lovely people might 
be mbiotcs in the bodi es of 
lower animals, or loathsome but 
intellectual worms. But he never 
had any success when he tried to 
pump them about whether they 
were like Earth inhabitants at 
home, or were issued these magnificent bodies and faces along 
with their passports to Earth. 

His unreasoning dislike of the 
males was undoubtedly part jealousy, for they were all tall, handsome, well-dressed, and athletic 
enough to be signed en masse by 
Hollywood. But the universal 
utter perfection of limb, features, 
and complexion was not at all repulsive in the female. It was quite 




 



decorative to have a whole chorus 
of toothsome girls in Paris gowns 
cluttering up the orifice. 

Jerry had never seen one of 
them use a lipstick, rouge, or an 
eyebrow pencil. The cosmetic business was one of the few that had 
not profited from the tourist 
trade, except insofar as lady tourists bought costly perfumes, and 
Earth girls strove to mimic the 
natural — or unnatural — coloring 
of the fair visitors. A few tourists 
brought their children along, and 
here the firm, rosy, unblemished 
skin was in its proper element. 
Tourist children were not one 
whit more cherubic than wellfavored chitdren of Earth. 

A guide from the Conducted 
Tours Company arrived to r,pund 
up a batch of tourists, for a visit 
to the local jails, flop-houses, and 
gambling dens. He announced 
they would go by bus, and the 
horrified yet delighted whoops 
that greeted this news reminded 
Jerry of a Boston society dowager 
who had just been invited to ride 
on a camel. 

As the crowd trickled out the 
doors, a lovely vision in platinum 
blonde laid a slender hand on 
Jerry's arm. 

"Are you realty the man who 
"first thought of inviting us to this 
quaint and delightful planet?" 
she gushed. 

"I guess I am, lady. How do 
you like it?" 



/'Oh. it's so primitive? So elemental! Everybody used to think 
visiting backward planets was 
dull and scholarly stuff. It took 
you to show us how thrilling and 
exciting it can be!" 

"I'm glad to hear you say that. 
Some of the tourists are complaining that Earth isn't as primitive as the Tourist Bureau advertising makes it out to be." 

"Oh, you do exaggerate a wee, 
tiny bit, but it's all in good fun, 
isn't it? On the whole, I'm not 
disappointed — especially not in 
the men!" She fluttered eyelashes, 
so long and dark that they looked 
artificial, at him. 

"The men?" Jerry asked blank
ly
"Oh, come, come!" the platinum blonde breathed throatily 
into his ear. "Don't pretend to be 
so innocent! You must have heard 
of the - simply terrific reputation 
Earthmen have acquired on other 
planets as masterful lovers!" 

"It's news to' me," Jerry admitted, "but it sounds like a good 
drawing card. I'M try to work 
something like that into our ads." 

"Always thinking about business, aren't you? Why don't you 
think of something else, for a 
change? Me, for instance. Don't 
you feel a little bit sorry for a 
girl like me, with nothing but perfectly civilized men to go home 
to?" the girl pouted invitingly. 

Jerry found himself, by imper


THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



93 



ceptible stages, being backed into 
a corner. Well, well, he thought. 
Perhaps he'd been too harsh in 
judging that racetrack tout. 

"Since you mention it," Jerry 
said, "I'm not averse to playing 
the role of Galactic beachboy." 

"What does a beachboy do?'* 

44 I'd blush to explain it verbally 
to a girl unaccustomed to primitive Earth customs, but I'm 
pretty good at sign language. How 
about dinner tonight?" 

"Well ... if you'll let me pay 
the check. I do so adore this 
amazing Earth custom of exchanging food for little slips of 
paper." 

"The pleasure is all yours, sister. See you at the Ritz main dining room — eight o'clock. Soup 
and fish. Afterward, we'll look at 
my photo-murals. Now toddle 
along, baby, if you want to catch 
the bus to see those hoboes.** 

Jerry was walking on the Milky 
Way. Aside from the profits, this 
job had its esthetic side, he decided. His exuberance was slightly dampened by the grim expression on his secretary's face. 

"A very important man has 
been waiting to see you," she said 
disapprovingly. "I sent him into 
your office. The least I could do 
was put him where he wouldn't 
have to smell all the perfume 
these brazen tourist women use. 
It's enough to make a person ill!" 

In the visitor's chair before 



Jerry's mother - of - pearl inlaid 
desk, the Ambassador from Outer 
Space was waiting, staring morosely at the endlessly repeated 
welcoming goddess Terra on 
Jerry's wall stamp collection. 

"Well, as I live and breathe!" 
Jerry exclaimed, "a real, live B-29 
pilot! Welcome to my humble 
grass shack! Scotch? Cigar? What 
can I do for you?" 

"You can put out your bonfire, 
cannibal," the Ambassador said, 
gruffly. "I think I've stewed 
enough." 

"Why are you tough, then?" 
Jerry asked. "At me, I mean. I 
thought I was your best friend in 
this here jungle. Didn't I do you 
a favor once, Mr. Ambassador?" 

"A favor? I paid you well for 
it! Not only in money, but by getting advertising space for your 
precious Tourist Bureau on the 
Federated Planets. I never 
thought it would lead to this!" 

"You thought my copy wouldn't pull, eh? Not even after I'd 
demonstrated I could make Earth 
opinion do a flip -flop on that 
Matter Repositor deal?" 

"Oh, I was quite sure you could 
, manipulate Earthmen. Thajt's 
your job. But I didn't believe our 
people would respond in such 
numbers to an appeal to primitive emotions!" 

"You weren't alone in that,'* 
Jerry said smugly. "Some very 
prominent members of our or


CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



ganization wanted to make the 
campaign more civilized. I showed them where they were wrong. 
Can't you see that your people 
are fed up with civilization, right 
up to their pretty white necks? 
The very essence of Earth's appeal to them is that a trip here 
gives them a chance to relax their 
ethics, to play at going native." 

"Don't rub it in!" The Ambassador shuddered. 

"It's nothing new. Tourists 
have always kicked up their 
heels. Guess what 1 saw while 
I was out to lunch. The cops 
grabbed a couple of your boys 
for shoplifting! They thought it 
was such fun to ride in the paddywagon. Back home, of course, 
they wouldn't think of repositing 
anything they weren't supposed 
to. but on Earth it's different." 

"And for fn oh key shines like 
that," the Ambassador growled, 
"I am driven half crazy working 
out sleep-record courses. 'Idioms 
of Earth English*— 'What Not to 
Say on Backward Planets and 
Why" — 'Earth Fashion Guide, 
What You Can Buy There and 
What to Reposit.' Bah! I'm supposed to be a diplomat, not a 
■fashion adviser!" 
' "Why don't you hire s6me 
help?" "Jerry suggested. 

"I have. I've hired a whole 
staff, with offices in all major 
Earth cities, to exchange platinum, bullion, and precious: stones 



for Earth currencies. It's a mansized job, I can tell you, to keep 
Earth currencies stable under this 
load!" 

"You're doing a very good 
job," Jerry said, soothingly. 

"You know what one of our 
citizens asked me yesterday? How 
she could get a marriage licensef 
Your officials had turned her 
down, because she'd been conditioned not to mention her birthplace and age. Mind you, a citizen of the Federated Planets 
wanted to marry an Earthman 
and live on this raw, Galactic 
frontier the rest of her life! Why, 
we don't even know whether the 
races can cross-breed!" 

"That should be looked into* 
Jerry agreed. 

"What are you trying to do?** 
the Ambassador demanded. 
"Drag the citizens of the Federated Planets down to the level 
of your jungle? YoU blithely assume those two shoplifters can 
be trusted with Matter Repositors 
when they get back home, but 
I'm not so sure. We haven't any 
jails to toss them into, but wc 
may have to establish some. Matter-Repositor-proof jails!" 

"That's your problem," Jerry 
said. "AH I'm trying to do is 
make some money for myself and 
other businessmen on Earth. 
Which I'm doing, thank you. And 
I doubt that you could stop me, 
at this point. Your citizens would 



THE PILOT AND THE BUSHMAN 



raise quite a howl if my ads stopped appearing in the information 
bulletins." 

"Money!" the Ambassador exclaimed, "All you Earthmen think 
about is money!" He leaned over 
Jerry's desk. "What if you could 
reposit the money — the gold, that 
is — without all the work you have 
to put into entertaining these 
tourists?" 

"Hmm," Jerry said, thinking of 
his date for that evening, and 
other equally lovely tourists. 
"Money isn't the only thing i 
life. And don't forget the income 
tax. I've got to have some deductible expenses." 

"Knowing you, I'd bet you 
.could figure out some way of handling that little detail." 

"What's your proposition?" 

"Two years ago, you came to 
my office, wanting to import Matter Repositors. I told you Earth's 
civilization wasn't ready for 
them." 

"We still aren't, according to 
what you say about our avaricious instincts." 

"No, you're not. But you have 
methods of manipulating public 
opinion and attitudes that arc far 
more advanced than those found 
on other planets." 

"So you admit that Earth is 
advanced in something!" Jerry 
said happily. 

"How would you like to have 
the name of Jerry Jergins go down 



in your history as the originator 
of the most significant publicrelations campaign ever undertaken on this planet?" the Ambassador asked, temptingly. "You 
can handle it, if any man on 
Earth can." 

"Softsoaping me again! What's 
the campaign? I'll listen to it, but 
I don't know whether I'll buy it" 
"Your job would be to get 
Earth's psychology and sociology 
ready for the Matter Repositor." 

Jerry reflected. "You mean I'd 
have to eliminate war, supplement the Voice of America, and 
so on? I'd have certain advantages over the Voice of America, 
at that. I wouldn't have a bunch 
of politicians playing football 
with my appropriations." 

"This campaign would have to 
go further and deeper than the 
Voice of America. You might call 
it the Voice of Conscience. Its aim 
would be to make every human 
being on Earth care more about 
the welfare of his fellow-man than 
he cares about his own." 

"A couple of thousand years 
back," Jerry said, soberly, "a better Promoter than I tried to put 
that idea across. The campaign 
He started is still running. It's 
taken hold in some quarters, but 
I wouldn't say public acceptance 
is anything like worldwide yet." 

"Then you don't think you can 
do it?" the Ambassador asked, hia 
eagerness somewhat deflated. 



H 




 



"I'm not committing myself to 
whether I could or couldn't. I 
could put the Ten Commandments on an international hookup. 
Thou shalt not steal. Thou shalt 
not covet thy neighbor his goods. 
I could get Walt Disney to dramatize the golden rule.*' 

"Ah, I see you have some ideas 
for the copy already," the Ambassador said. "I thought I could 
get you interested in it. Then 
you'll sign a contract?" 

"No," Jerry said, briefly and 
definitely. 

"Now, wait a minute, Mr. Jergins," the Ambassador protested. 
"Why do you suddenly become 
blunt and unqualified? Do you 
realize what I'm offering you? In 
return for ceasing this tourist promotion, I'm offering you the invention that obsolesces all others 
■ — the Matter Repositor!" 

Jerry stood up and placed the 
palms of his hands flat on his 
desk. "I told you that you'd learn 
something in our primitive jungle, 
Mr. Ambassador. Well, this is it. 
We may be mechanical morons, 
according to your standards, but 
we naked savages can produce 
anything we need. Since we've 
corrected the misconception that 
what Earth produces isn't good 
enough for Earthmen, and whipped up a tourist trade, business 
is booming. And when it booms, 
we can distribute those Earth 
products in a way that suits us 



pretty well. A primitive way, you 
may think, but one that is 
adapted to the unfortunate circumstance that we aren't a bunch 
of little tin saints living in an 
ideal world. 

"I asked you for Matter Repositors once, and you were wise 
enough to turn me down. I'm glad 
you did. They'd cause us more 
trouble than {he atomic bomb. 
We don't want the damn things. 
Do you understand that?" 

On sudden impulse, Jerry 
strode across his office. There 
stood a large and brilliantly colored object, jarring oddly with 
the other furniture. Sometimes at 
a toss to spend his newly acquired 
wealth, Jerry had yielded, a 
month or so before, to a desire 
conceived in childhood to own a 
real honest-to-goodness juke box. 

Jerry fished in his pocket for a 
nickel, deposited it in the slot, 
pushed button seven. Loud, tinny, 
and offensively blatant, the 
strains of "I Don't Wanna Leave 
the Congo" filled the office, effectively drowning out any further remarks the Ambassador 
from Outer Space might have 
wished to make. 

"If you'll pardon me," Jerry 
shouted over the din, "I have 
some arrow heads to chip — and a 
potential extraterrestrial mate to 
woo with a quaint tribal ritual we 
call dating on Earth."

PEOPLE say the book's obscure. It's not scientific. It's 
pontifical. Its style's too purple. 
In general, I'm nuts for liking 
it. Maybe I am. 

We have a postulated World 
parallel to Earth. It is called 
KronWeld, and is one of millions 
of different parallel worlds. 
People and things can be transferred to it with the aid of great 
machines. 

Many centuries after the Nth 
World War, techniques are developed whereby all babies testing 



potentially brilliant in learning 
are sent to this parallel world in 
an effort to preserve them from 
the savageries on Earth. 

After still more centuries, these 
Great Brains have become slaves 
of scientific superstitions, while 
on Earth the ignorant masses 3fe 
the slaves of arrogant masters 
known as the Statists, who also 
control access to Kronweld and 
are planning to destroy the latter 
to prevent the scientists from ever 
returning arid destroying them. 

However, there are rebels both 
on Earth and oh Kronweld, who 
oppose the superstition -ridden 
scientists as well as the Statists. 

This is not science fiction of 



M 




 



tomorrow. It is a never-never 
science fiction — but combined 
with it is an almost painfully real 
and immediate message which is 
not fiction at all. The message: 
If people don't get together on 
a free and peaceful basis pretty 
soon, there'll be no more people 
to get together. 

But the message never gets in 
the way. You may have to hunt 
for it, in fact, while reading about 
the civilization of scientists in 
which there a re no sciences of 
biology, botany or zoology and 
no arts and practices of medicine 
or surgery; and in which the 
search of scientists for certitudes 
is exposed as merely an abdication of scientific responsibility, 
which is — never assume that 
anything is eternally true!

|~1NE of the minor miracles 
connected with this Collier's 
serial by science fiction's old British friend, John Beynon Harris, 
is the fact that anyone familiar 
with the Harris of the early '30s 
will wonder how the Harris of 
the '50s could have learned how 
to write in so workmanlike a 
fashion. 

As a story, the current opus is 
what you'd call a good ■ run-of

the-mill affair, not the worst by 
any means, but also not the best, 
of the long literature of World 
Catastrophe tales. 

It deals with the invention (or 
development) of some horrid 
Triffids, and the coincidental occurrence of a display of incredible heavenly fireworks all 
around the world that makes 
everyone who looked at them permanently blind. 

Conflict: the struggles of the 
tiny handful of those who did 
not see the fireworks, and who 
consequently still have vision, to 
survive the combined horrors of 
great gobs of people dying all 
over the place, and great masses 
of sentient vegetables trying to 
attack all humans they can lay 
their poisonous "whips" on. 

The coincidence is not quite as 
great as it sounds, since "Wyndham" suggests that the phenomena are secret war weapons — 
the Triffids are escapees from a 
Russian botanical laboratory, 
the fireworks the result of a 
cosmic accident to one of the 
"Earth satellite vehicles" which 
the competing Great Powers 
have thrown up above the atmosphere in Swift death orbits. 

Oh, well, i t hasn't happened

some pleasant reading in this 
book, provided you aren't out 
hunting science fiction masterpieces.

TI1VE AND AGAIN by Clifford

THIS is one of those complex, 
sometimes obscure and enormously inventive stories, in the 
same general tradition as Renaissance, that seems most characteristic of the best modern science 
fiction. Though in some ways not 
as effective as the Jones novel, it 
still is an enormously impressive 
job as GALAXY readers who 
read it under its serialized name 
of Time Quarry will remember. 

Like so much good modern 
science fiction, Simak's new book 
is based on some real, honest, 
practical ethical thinking. It is an 
idea book. 

Asher Sutton, the protagonist, 
has been completely remade by 
the strange beings of a planet 
circling round Cygni 61, many 
light years from Earth. He has 
learned a new sort of living and 
has become a new sort of person 
—not a true "superman" as we 
understand it, but different — as a 
result of what these "symbiotic 
abstractions" did to him. 

He terms his new attitude not 
a religion but something he calls 
"Destiny," and the major premise 
of his philosophy is : "Nothing 
living walks alone," thus describing the essential oneness and 
equality of all sentience. 

From the future come several 



competing forces that are warring among themselves (Jime is 
their battlefield!) in an effort to 
change the course of Asher Sutton's future. It seems that he will 
write a book on his ideas. It will 
completely change the direction 
of our intergalactic progress. 

One future group wants the 
book and the democratic, equalitarian future unchanged. Another 
group wants to kill Sutton before 
he writes the book, thus completely eliminating his influence. 
A third group wants to "buy" 
him and make him change his 
message to read "Nothing hu man" rather than "Nothing living' — naturally a complete abandonment of the original credo. 

The development of this rich 
"idea will keep the reader on the 
edge of his seat, provided he is 
not looking for (a) wild and 
woolly cops-and-robbers stuff; 
(b) Buck Rogers; (c) S-x; and 
(d) comic-book literary style. It 
has none of those. 

An unfortunate cavil must be 
put in about the ending. The last 
page Simak wrote for the GALAXY version has been replaced 
with his original conclusion. The 
one he uses in the novel literally 
reverses the whole intent and 
meaning of his book — a shocking 
piece of backing down which 
leaves the reader convinced that 
Simak, after all, thinks his hero 
Asher Sutton is a dangerous fool 




 



and an idealistic crackpot. Not a 
very courageous way of ending 
an otherwise courageous novel. 

— And now let me introduce 
the Guest Reviewer of the Month, 
Willy Ley. The book Mr. Ley 
reviews for me is one which, to 
speak frankly, he is ten thousand 
times more competent to understand than I. 

INTERPLANETARY FLIGHT, 
An Introduction to Astronautics, 
by Arthur C. Clarke. Harper & 
Bros., New York, 1951. 164 pages, 
$2.50. 

IF you ever took an instruction 
*■ course of the forced draft type, 
where you learned a great number of things in a minimum of 
time, you'll probably be reminded of this course when you read 
the book published by the Assistant Secretary of the British 
Interplanetary Society. 

Within his 164 pages, Arthur 
C,. Clarke includes the larger portion of space travel theory. He 
does not discuss space travel 
problems as an engineer who 
wants to suggest possible solutions to specific points. He approaches them from the point of 
view of the astronomer who 
knows his gravitational fields and 
his orbits, and describes: what has 
to be accomplished before interplanetary flight can be undertaken. 



Consequently, there is very little about present-day rockets in 
this book — just a few highlights 
to show how far "the art" has 
progressed during a short quarter century. Beyond them, the 
book is entirely devoted to the 
basic req uirem ents of space 
travel, especially the Earth-Moon 
trip. 

Don't, if you should open the 
book at random in a store, be 
frightened by an occasional equation. They are all quite simple 
and moreover fully explained. 
Some mathematical argument, 
also quite simple, is condensed in 
an appendix. There are several 
interesting charts and some fine 
photographs. 

In short, if you want to know 
more about space travel than you 
can extract from the typical space 
opera, this is the book to read. 
Because it is both short and condensed, you'll probably read it 
more than once — and if you do, 
you will then rind out how many 
interesting items slipped by you 
on first reading. 

WILLY LEV 

Thanks, Willy. I'd take your 
advice and read the book at once 
if it wasn't for the fact that my 
mother was scared by a quadratic 
equation when I was minus six 
months old, and I've had psychological problems with algebra 
ever since.

THE man "from the JVews 
asked, "What do you think 
of the aliens, Mister Nathen? Are they friendly? Do they 
look human?" 

"Very human," said the thin 
young mart. 



Outside, rain sleeted across the 
big windows with a steady faint 
drumming, blurring and dimming 
the view of the airfield where 
they would arrive. On the concrete rUnways, the puddles were 
pockmarked with rain, and the

grass growing untouched between 
the runways of the unused field 
glistened wetly, bending before 
gusts of wind.

from where the huge spaceship 
would land were the gray shapes

huddled inside their mobile units, 
waiting. Farther back in the deserted sandy landscape, behind 
distant sandy hills, artillery was. 
ringed in a great circle, and in 
the distance across the horizon, 

10* 



bombers stood ready at airfields, 
guarding the world against possible treachery from the first alien 
ship ever to land from space. 

"Do you know anything about 
their home planet?" asked the 
man from Herald. 

The TVmes man stood with the 
others, listening absently, thinking of questions, but reserving 
them. Joseph R. Nathen, the thin 
young * man with the straight 
black hair and the tired lines on 
his face, was being treated with 
respect by his interviewers. He 
was obviously on edge, and they 
did not want to harry him with 
too many questions to answer at 
once. They wanted to keep his 
1 good will. Tomorrow he would be 
one of the biggest celebrities ever 
to appear in headlines. 
"No, nothing directly." 
"Any ideas or deductions?" 
Herald persisted. 
' ■ "Their world must be Earth like to them," the weary-looking 
; young man answered uncertainly. 
"The environment evolves the animal. But only in relative terms, 
! of course." He looked at them 
with a quick glance and then 
. looked away evasively, his lank 
black hair beginning to cling to 
hie forehead with sweat. "That 
doesn't necessarily mean anything." 

"Earthlike," muttered a reporter, writing it down as if he had 
noticed nothing more in the reply. 



The Times man glanced at the 
Herald, wondering if he had noticed, and received a quick 
glance in exchange. 

The Herald asked Nathen, 
"You think they are dangerous, 
then?" 

It was the kind of question, assuming much, which usually 
broke reticence and brought forth 
quick facts — when it hit the mark. 
They all knew of the military 
precautions, although they were 
not supposed to know. 

The question missed. Nathen 
glanced out the window vaguely. "No, I wouldn't say so." 

"You think they are friendly, 
then?" said the Herald, equally 
positive on the opposite tack. 

A Meeting smile touched Nathen's lips. "Those I know are." 

There was no lead in this direction, and they had to get the 
basic facts of the story before the 
ship came. The Times asked, 
"What led up to your contacting 
them?" 

Nathen answered after a hesitation. "Static. Radio static. The 
Army told you my job, didn't 
they?" 

THE Army had told them 
nothing at all. The officer 
who had conducted them in for 
the interview stood glowering 
watchfully, as if he objected by 
instinct to telling anything to the 
public. 



104 




 



Nathen glanced at him doubtfully. "My job is radio decoder 
for the Department of Military 
Intelligence. I use a directional 
pickup, tune in on foreign bands, 
record any scrambled or coded 
messages I hear, and build automatic decoders and descramblers 
for all the basic scramble patterns." 

The officer cleared his throat, 
but said nothing. 

The reporters smiled, noting 
that down. 

Security regulations had 
changed since arms inspection 
had been legalized by the U.N. 
Complete information being the 
only public security against secret rearmament, spying and prying had come to seem a public 
service. Its aura had changed. It 
was good public relations to admit to it. 

Nathen continued, "I started 
directing the pickup at stars in 
my spare time. There's radio 
noise from stars, you know. Just 
stuff that sounds like spatter 
static, and an occasional squawk. 
People have been listening to it 
for a long time, and researching, 
trying to work out why stellar 
radiation on those bands comes 
in such jagged bursts. It didn't 
seem natural." 

He paused and smiled uncertainly, aware that the next thing 
he would say was the thing that 
would make him famous — an 



idea that had come to him while 
he listened — an idea as simple 
and as perfect as the one that 
came to Newton when he saw the 
apple fall. 

"I decided it wasn't natural. I 
tried decoding it." 

Hurriedly he tried to explain 
it away and make it seem obvious. "You see, there's an old intelligence trick, speeding up a 
message on a record until it 
soun ds just 1 i ke th at , a shoit 
squawk of static, and then broadcasting it. Undergrounds use it. 
I'd heard that kind of screech 
before." 

"You mean they broadcast at 
us in code?" asked the News. 

"It's not exactly code. All you 
need to do is record it and slow 
it down. They're not broadcasting at us. If a star has planets, 
inhabited planets, and there is 
broadcasting between them, they 
would send it on a tight beam to 
save power." He looked for comprehension. "You know, like a 
spotlight. Theoretically, a tight 
beam can go on forever without 
losing power. But aiming would 
be difficult from planet to planet. 
You can't expect a beam to stay 
on target, over such distances, 
more than a few seconds at a 
time. So they'd naturally compress each message into a short 
half-second or one-second -length 
package and send it a few hundred times in one long blast to 



PICTURES DON'T LIE 



make sure it is picked up duririg 
the instant the beam swings 
across the target." 

He was talking slowly and 
carefully, remembering that this 
explanation was for the newspapers. "When a stray beam swings 
through our section of space, 
there's a sharp peak in noise level 
from that direction. The beams 
are swinging to follow their own 
planets at home, and the distance between there and here exaggerates the speed of swing tremendously, so we wouldn't pick 
up more than a l^ip as it passes." 

"How do you account for the 
number of squawks coming in?" 
the Times asked. "Do stellar systems rotate on the plane of the 
Galaxy?" It was a private question; he spoke impulsively from 
interest and excitement. 

The radio decoder grinned, the 
lines of strain vanishing from his 
face for a moment. "Maybe we're 
intercepting everybody's telephone calls, and the whole Galaxy is swarming with races that 
spend all day yacking at each 
other over the radio. Maybe the 
human type is standard model." 

"It would take something like 
that," the Times agreed. They 
smiled at each other. 

The News asked, "How did you 
happen to pick up television instead of voices?" 

"Not by accident," Nathan explained patiently. "Fd recognized 



a scanning pattern, and I wanted 
pictures. Pictures are understandable in any language." 

"l^EAR the interviewers, a Sena■* ^ tor paced back and forth, 
muttering his memorized speech 
of welcome and nervously glancing out the wide streaming windows into the gray sleeting rain. 

Opposite the windows of the 
long room was a small raised 
platform flanked by the tall 
shapes of TV cameras and sound 
pickups on booms, and darkened 
floodlights, arranged and ready 
for the Senator to make his speech 
of welcome to the aliens and the 
world. A shabby radio sending 
set stood beside it without a case 
to conceal its parts, two cathode 
television tubes flickering nakedly on one side and the speaker 
humming on the other. A vertical panel of dials and knobs jutted up before them and a small 
hand-mike sat ready on the table 
before the panel. It was connected to a boxlike, expensively 
cased piece of equipment with 
"Radio Lab, U.S. Property" stenciled on it. 

"I recorded a couple of package screeches from Sagittarius 
and began working On them," 
Nathen added. "It took a couple 
of months to find the synchronizing signals and set the scanners 
close enough to the right time to 
even get a pattern. When I show


106 




 



ed the pattern to the Department, they gave me full time to 
work on it, and an assistant to 
help. It took eight months to pick 
out the color bands, and assign 
them the right colors, to get anything intelligible on the screen." 

'|iHE shabby -looking mess of 
exposed parts was the original 
receiver that they had labored 
over for ten months, adjusting 
and readjusting to reduce the 
maddening rippling plaids of unsynchronized color scanners to 
some kind of sane picture. 

"Trial and error." said Nathen, 
"but it came out all right. The 
wide band-spread of the squawks 
had suggested color TV from the 
beginning." 

He walked over and touched 
the set. The speaker bipped 
slightly and the gray screen flickered with a flash of color at the 
touch. The set was awake and 
sensitive, tuned to receive from 
the great interstellar spaceship 
which now circled the atmosphere. 

"We wondered why there were 
so many bands, but when we got 
the set working, and started recording and playing everything 
that came in, we found we'd tapped something like a lending library line. It was all fiction, 
plays." 

Between the pauses in Nathen's 
voice, the Times found himself 



unconsciously listening for the 
sound of roaring, swiftly approaching rocket jets. 

The Post asked, "How did you 
contact the spaceship?" 

"I scanned and recorded«a film 
copy of Rite of Spring, the Disney -Stravinsky combination, and 
sent it back along the same line 
we were receiving from. Just testing. It wouldn't get there for a 
good number of years, if it got 
there at all, but I thought it 
would please the library to get a 
new record in. 

"Two weeks later, when we 
caught and slowed a new batch 
of recordings, we found an answer. It was obviously meant for 
us. It was a flash of the Disney 
being played to a large audience, 
and then the audience sitting and 
waiting before a blank screen. The 
signal was very clear and loud. 
We'd intercepted a spaceship. 
They were asking for an encore, 
you see. They liked the film and 
wanted more . . ." 

He smiled at them in sudden 
thought. "You can see them for 
yourself. It's all right down the 
hall where the linguists are working on the automatic translator." 

The listening officer frowned 
and cleared his throat, and the 
thin young man turned to him 
quickly. "No security reason why 
they should not see the broadcasts, is there? Perhaps you 
should show them." He said to 



PICTURES DON'T LIE 



107 



the reporters reassuringly, "It's 
right down the hall. You will be 
informed the moment the spaceship approaches." 

The interview was very definitely ^ver. The lank-haired, nervous young man turned away 
and seated himself at the radio 
set while the officer swallowed 
his objections and showed them 
dourly down the hall to a closed 
door. 

They opened it and fumbled 
into a darkened room crowded 
with empty folding chairs, dominated by a glowing bright screen. 
The door closed behind them, 
bringing total darkness. 

There was the sound of reporters fumbling their way into seats 
around him, but the Times man 
remained standing, aware of an 
enormous surprise, as if he had 
been asleep and wakened to find 
himself in the wrong country. 

The bright colors of the double 
image seemed the only real, thing 
in the darkened room. Even 
blurred as they were, he could 
see that the action was subtly 
different, the shapes subtly not 
right. 

He was looking at aliens. 

rpHE impression was of two hu■■■ mans disguised, humans moving oddly, half-dancing, halfcrippled. Carefully, afraid the 
images would go away, he reached up to his breast pocket, took 



out his polarized glasses, rotated 
one lens at right angles to the 
other and put them on. 

Immediately, the two beings 
came into sharp focus, real and 
solid, and the screen became a 
wide, illusively near window 
through which he watched them. 

They were conversing with 
each other in a gray-walled room, 
discussing something with restrained excitement. The large 
man in the green tunic closed his 
purple eyes for an instant at 
something the other said, and 
grimaced, making a motion with 
his fingers as if shoving something away from him. 

Mellerdrammer. 

The second, smaller, with yellowish-green eyes, stepped closer, 
talking more rapidly in a lower 
voice. The first stood very still, 
not trying to interrupt. 

Obviously, the proposal was 
some advantageous treachery, 
and he wanted to be persuaded. 
The rimes groped for a chair 
and sat down. 

Perhaps gesture is universal; 
desire and aversion, a leaning forward or a leaning back, tension, 
relaxation. Perhaps these actors 
were masters. The scenes changed, 
a corridor, a parklike place in 
what he began to realize was a 
spaceship, a lecture room. There 
were others talking and working, 
speaking to the man in the green 
tunic, and never was it unclear 



141 




 



what was happening or how they 
felt. 

They talked a flowing language 
with many short vowels and 
shifts of pitch, and they gestured 
in the heat of talk, their hands 
moving with an odd lagging difference of motion, not slow, but 
somehow drifting. 

He ignored the language, but 
after a time the difference in motion began to arouse his interest. 
Something in the way they 
walked . . . 

With an effort he pulled his 
mind from the plot and forced 
his attention to the physical difference. Brown hair in short silky 
crew cuts, varied eye colors, the 
colors showing clearly because 
their irises were very large, their 
round eyes set very widely apart 
in taperin g light-brown faces. 
Their necks and shoulders were 
thick in a way that would indicate unusual strength for a human, but their wrists were narrow and their fingers long* and 
thin and delicate. 

There seemed to be more than 
the usual number of fingers. 

Since he came in, a machine 
had been whirring and a voice 
muttering beside him. He called 
his attention from counting their 
fingers and looked around. Be side him sat an alert-looking man 
wearing earphones, watching and 
listening with hawklike concentration. Beside hirn was a tall 



streamlined box. From the screen 
came the sound of the alien language. The man abruptly flipped 
a switch on the box, muttered a 
word into a small hand-microphone and flipped the switch 
back with nervous rapidity. 

He reminded the Times man of 
the earphoned interpreters at the 
UN. The machine was probably 
a vocal translator and the mutterer a linguist adding to its vocabulary. Near the screen were 
two other linguists taking notes. 

TPHE rimes remembered the 
Senator pacing in the observatory room, rehearsing his 
speech of welcome. The speech 
would not be just the empty 
pompous gesture he had expected. It would be translated mechanically and understood by the 
aliens. 

On the other side of the glowing window that was the stereo 
screen, the large protagonist in 
the green tunic was speaking to a 
pilot in a gray uniform. They 
stood in a brightly lit canaryyellow control room in a spaceship. 

The Times tried to pick up the 
thread of the plot. Already he was 
interested in the fate of the hero, 
and liked him.. That was the effect of good acting, probably, for 
part of the art of acting is to win 
affection from the audience, and 
this actor might be the matinee

idol of whole solar systems. 

Controlled tension, betraying 
itself by a jerk of the hands, a 
too-quick answer to a question. 
The uniformed one, not suspicious, turned his back, busying 
himself at some task involving a 
map lit with glowing red points, 
his motions sharing the same fluid 
dragging grace of the others, as 
if they were underwater, or on a 
slow motion film. The other was 
watching a switch, a switch set 
into a panel, moving closer to it, 
talking casually — background 
music coming and rising in thin 
chords of tension. 

There was a closeup of the 
alien's face watching the switch, 
and the Times noted that his ears 
were symmetrically half -circles, 
almost perfect with no earholes 
visible. The voice of the uniformed one answered, a brief 
word in a preoccupied deep voice. 
His back was still turned. The 
other glanced at the switch, moving closer to it, talking casually, 
the switch coming closer and 
closer stereoscopically. It was in 
reach, filling the screen. His hand 
came into view, darting out, 
closed over the switch-™ 

There was a sharp clap of 
sound and his hand opened in a 
frozen shape of pain. Beyond him, 
as his gaze swung up, stood the 
figure of the uniformed officer, 
unmoving, a weapon rigid in his 
hand, in the startled position in 



which he had turned and fired, 
watching with widening eyes as 
the man in the green tunic swayed and fell. 

The tableau held, the uniformed one drooping, looking down 
at his hand holding the weapon 
which had killed, and music began to build in from the background. Just for an instant, the 
room and the things within it 
flashed into one of those bewildering color changes which were 
the bane of color television, and 
switched to a color negative of 
itself, a green man standing in a 
violet control room, looking down 
at the body of a green man in a 
red tunic. It held for less than a 
second; then the color band alternator fell back into phase and 
the colors reversed to normal. 

Another uniformed man came 
and took the weapon from the 
limp hand of the other, who began to explain dejectedly in a 
low voice while the music 
mounted and covered his words 
and the screen slowly went blank, 
like a window that slowly filmed 
over with gray fog. 

The music faded. 

In the dark, someone clapped 
appreciatively. 

The earphoned man beside the 
Times shifted his earphones back 
from his ears and spoke briskly. 
"I can't get any more. Either of 
you want a replay?" 

There was a short silence un


110 



GALAXY SC1ENCI FICTION 



tit the linguist nearest the set 
said. "I guess we've squeezed that 
one dry. Let's run the tape where 
Nathen and that ship radio boy 
are kidding around CQing and 
tuning their beams in closer. I 
have a hunch the boy is talking 
routine ham talk and giving the 
old radio count— one-two-threetest tng." 

There was some fumbling in 
the se mi-dark and then the screen 
came to life again. 

TT showed a flash of an audience 
sitting before a screen and 
gave a clipped chord of some familiar symphony. "Crazy about 
Stravinsky and Mozart," remarked the earphoned linguist to the 
7*imes, resettling his earphones. 
"Can*t stand Gershwin. Can you 
beat that?" He turned his attention back to the screen as the 
right sequence came on! 

The Post, who was sitting just 
in front of him, turned to the 
Times and said, "Funny 1 how 
much they look like people." He 
was writing, making notes to telephone his report. "What color 
hair did that character have?" 

"I didn't notice." He wondered 
if he should remind the reporter 
that Nathen had said he assigned 
the color bands on guess, choosing the colors that gave the most 
plausible images. The guests, 
when they arrived, could turn 
out to be bright green with blue 



hair. Only the gradations of color 
in the picture were sure, only the 
similarities and contrasts, the relationship of one color to another. 

From the screen came the 
sound of the alien language again. 
This race averaged deeper voices 
than human. He liked deep voices. 
Could he write that? 

No, there was something wrong 
with that, too. How had Nathen 
established the right sound-track 
pitch? Was it a matter of taking 
the modulation as it came in, or 
some sort of hetrodyning up and 
down by trial and error? Probably. 

It might be safer to assume 
that Nathen had simply preferred 
deep voices. 

As he sat there, doubting, an 
uneasiness he had seen in Nathen 
came back to add to his own uncertainty, and he remembered 
just how close that uneasiness 
had come to something that looked like restrained fear. 

"What I don*t get is why he 
went to all the trouble of picking 
up TV shows instead of just contacting them," the News complained. "They're good shows, but 
what's the point?" 

"Maybe so we'd get to learn 
their language too," said the Herald. 

On the screen now was the obviously unstaged and genuine 
scene of a young alien working

over a bank of apparatus. He 
turned and waved and opened 
his mouth in the comical O shape 
which the Times was beginning 
to recognize as their equivalent 
of a smile, then went back to trying to explain something about 
the equipment, in elaborate awkward gestures and carefully 
mouthed words. 

The Times got up quietly, went 
out into the bright white stone 
corridor and walked back the 
way he had come, thoughtfully 
folding his stereo glasses and putting them away. 

No one stopped him. Secrecy 
restrictions were ambiguous here. 
The reticence of the Army seemed 
more a matter of habit, mere reflex, from the fact that it had all 
originated in the Intelligence Department, than any reasoned policy of keeping the landing a secret. 

The main room was more 
crowded than he had left it. The 
TV camera and sound crew stood 
near their apparatus, the Senator 
had found a chair and was reading, and at the far end of the 
room eight men were grouped in 
a circle of chairs, arguing something with impassioned concentration. The Times recognized a 
few he knew personally, eminent 
names in science, workers in field 
theory. 

A stray phrase reached him: 
" — reference to the universal con


stants as ratio — *' It was probably a discussion of ways of converting formulas from one mathematics to another for a rapid exchange of information.
They had reason to be intent, 
aware of the flood of insights that 
novel viewpoints could bring, if 
they could grasp them. He would 
have liked to go over and listen, 
but there was too little time left 
before the spaceship was due, 
and he had a question to ask. 

r ¥^HE hand-rigged transceiver 
was still humming, tuned to 
the sending band of the circling 
ship, and the young man who 
had started it all was sitting on 
the edge of the TV platform with 
his chin resting in one hand. He 
did not look up as the Times approached, but it was the indifference of preoccupation, not discourtesy. 

The Times sat down on the 
edge of the platform beside him 
and took out a pack of cigarettes, 
then remembered the coming TV 
broadcast and the ban on smoking. He put them away, thoughtfully watching the diminishing 
rain spray against the streaming 
windows. 

"What's wrong?" he asked, 

Nathen showed that he was 
aware and friendly by a slight 
motion of his head. 

"You tell me." 

"Hunch,'* said the Times man.'' 



112 




 



"Sheer hunch. Everything sailing along too smoothly, everyone 
taking too much for granted." 

Nathen relaxed slightly "I'm 
still listening." 

"Something about the way they 
move ..." 

Nathen shifted to glance at 
him. 

"That's bothered me, too." 

"Are you sure they're adjusted 
to the right speed?" 

Nathen clenched his hands out 
in front of him and looked at 
them consideringly. "I don't 
know. When I turn the tape faster, they're all rushing, and you 
begin to wonder why their clothes 
don't stream behind them, why 
the doors close so quickly and yet 
you can't hear them shim, why 
things fall so fast. If I turn it 
slower, they all seem to be swimming." He gave the Times a considering sidewise glance. "Didn't 
catch the name." 

Country-bred guy, thought the 
Times. "Jacob Luke, Times," he 
said, extending his hand. 

Nathen gave the hand a quick, 
hard grip, identifying the name. 
"Sunday Science Section editor. 
I read it. Surprised to meet you 
here." 

"Likewise." The Times smiled. 
*'Look, have you gone into this 
rationally, with formulas?" He 
found a pencil in his pocket. "Obviously there's something wrong 
with our judgment of their 



weight - to - speed - to - momentum ratio. Maybe it's something 
simple like low gravity aboard 
ship, with magnetic shoes. Maybe they are floating slightly." 

"Why worry?" Nathen cut in. 
"I don't see any reason to try to ■ 
figure it out now." He laughed 
and shoved back his black hair 
nervously. "We'll see them in 
twenty minutes." 

"Will we?" asked the Times 
slowly. 

There was a silence while the 
Senator turned a page of his magazine with a slight crackling of 
paper, and the scientists argued 
at the other end of the room. 
Nathen pushed at his lank black 
hair again, as if it were trying to 
fall forward in front of his eyes 
and keep him from seeing. 

"Sure." The young ntan laughed suddenly, talked rapidly. 
"Sure we'll see them. Why 
shouldn't we, with all the government ready with welcome 
speeches, the whole Army turned 
out and hiding over the hill, reporters all around, newsreel cameras^ — everything set up to broadcast the landing to the world. 
The President himself shaking 
hands with me and waiting in 
Washington — " 

He came to the truth without 
pausing for breath. 

He said, "Hell, no, they won't 
get here. There's some mistake 
somewhere. Something's wrong.

t should have told the brasshats 
yesterday when I started adding 
it up. Don't know why I didn't 
say anything. Scared, I guess. 
Too much top rank around here. 
Lost my nerve." 

He clutched the Times man's 
sleeve. "Look. I don't know 
what—" 

A green light flashed on the 
sending - receiving set. Nathen 
didn't look at it, but he stopped 
talking. 

^J'HE loudspeaker on the set 
•■■ broke into a voice speaking 
in the alien's language. The Senator started and looked nervously at it, straightening his tie. The 
voice stopped. 

Nathen turned and looked at 
the loudspeaker. His worry seemed to be gone. 

"What is it?" the Times asked 
anxiously. 

"He says they've slowed enough 
to enter the atmosphere now. 
They'll be here in five to ten minutes, I guess. That's Bud. He's all 
excited. He says holy smoke, 
what a murky-looking planet we 
live on." Nathen smiled. "Kidding." 

The Times was puzzled. "What 
does he mean, murky? It can't 
be raining over much territory on 
Earth." Outside, the rain was 
slowing and bright blue patches 
of sky were shining through 
breaks in the cloud blanket, glit


tering blue light from the drops 
that ran down the windows. He 
tried to think of an explanation. 
"Maybe they're trying to land on 
Venus." The thought was ridiculous, he knew. The spaceship was 
following Nathen's sending beam. 
It couldn't miss Earth. "Bud" 
had to be kidding. 

The green light glowed on the 
set again, and they stopped 
speaking, waiting for the message 
to be recorded, slowed and replayed. The cathode screen came 
to life suddenly with a picture 
of the young man sitting at his 
sending-set, his back turned, 
watching a screen at one side 
which* showed a glimpse of a 
huge dark plain approaching. As 
the ship plunged down toward it, 
the illusion of solidity melted into 
a .boiling turbulance of blact 
clouds. They expanded in an inkf 
swirl, looked huge for an instant, 
and then blackness swallowed the 
screen. The young alien swung 
around to face the camera, speaking a few words as he moved, 
made the O of a smile again, 
then flipped the switch and the 
screen went gray. 

Nathen's voice was suddenly 
toneless and strained. "He said 
something like break out the 
drinks, here they come." 

"The atmosphere doesn,'t look 
like that," the Times said at random, knowing he was saying 
something too obvious even to 



114 




 




riCTURES DON'T III

think about. "Not Earth's atmosphere." 

Some people drifted up. "What 
did they say?" 

"Entering the atmosphere, 
ought to be landing in five or ten 
minutes," Nathen told them. 

A ripple of heightened excitement ran through the room. Cameramen began adjusting the lens 
angles again, turning on the mike 



and checking it, turning on the 
floodlights. The scientists rose and 
stood near the window, still talking. The reporters trooped in 
from the hall and went to the 
windows to watch for the great 
event. The three linguists came 
in, trundling a large wheeled box 
that was the mechanical translator, supervising while it was 
hitched into the sound broadcasting system. 

"Landing where?" the Times 
asked Nathen brutally. "Why 
don't you do something?" 

"Tell me what to do and I'll 
do it," Nathen said quietly, not 
moving. 

It was not sarcasm. Jacob Luke 
of the Times looked sidewise at 
the strained whiteness of his face, 
and moderated his tone. "Can't 
you contact them?" 

"Not while they're landing." 

"What now?" The Times took 
out a pack of cigarettes, remembered the rule against smoking, 
and put it back. 

"We just wait." Nathen leaned 
his elbow on one knee and his 
chin in his hand. 

They waited. 

ALL the people in the room 
were waiting. There was no 
more conversation. A bald man 
of the scientist group was automatically buffing his fingernails 
over and over and inspecting 
them without seeing them, an

other absently polished his glasses, held them up to the light, 
put them on. and then a moment 
later took them off and began 
polishing again. The television 
crew concentrated on their jobs, 
moving quietly and efficiently, 
with perfectionist care, minutely 
arranging things which did not 
need to be arranged, checking 
things that had already been 
checked. 

This was to be one of the great 
moments of human history, and 
they were all trying to forget that 
fact and remain impassive and 
wrapped up in the problems of 
their jobs as good specialists 
should. 

After an interminable age the 
Times consulted his watch. Three 
minutes had passed. He tried 
holding his breath a moment, listening for a distant approaching 
thunder of jets. There was no 
sound. 

The sun came out from behind 
the clouds and lit up the field like 
a great spotlight on an empty 
Btage. 

Abruptly the green light shone 
on the set again, indicating that 
a squawk message had been received. The recorder recorded it, 
slowed it and fed it back to the 
speaker. It clicked and the sound 
was very loud in the still, tense 
room. 

The screen remained gray, but 
Bud's voice spoke a few words in 



the alien language. He stopped, 
the speaker clicked and the light 
went out. When it was plain 
that nothing more would occur 
and no announcement was to be 
made of what was said, the 
people in the room turned back 
to the windows, talk picked up 
again. 

Somebody told a joke and 
laughed alone. 

One of the linguists remained 
turned toward the loudspeaker, 
then looked at the widening patches of blue sky showing out the 
window, his expression puzzled. 
He had understood. 

"It's dark," the thin Intelligence Department decoder translated, low-voiced, to the man 
from the Times. "Your atmosphere is thick. That's precisely 
what Bud said." 

Another three minutes. The 
Times caught himself about to 
light a cigarette and swore silenly, blowing the match out and 
putting the cigarette back into its 
package. He listened for the 
sound of the rocket jets. It was 
time for the landing, yet he heard 
no blasts. 

The green light came on in the 
transceiver. 

Message in. 

Instinctively he came to his 
feet. Nathen abruptly was standing beside him. Then the message 
came in the voice he was coming 
to think of as Bud. It spoke and

paused. Suddenly the Times 
knew. 

"We've landed." Nathen whispered the words. 

The wind blew across the open 
spaces of white concrete and 
damp soil that was the empty 
airfield, swaying the wet, shiny 
grass. The people Ui the room 
looked out, listening for the roar 
of jets, looking for the silver 
bulk of a spaceship in the sky. 

Nathen moved, seating himself 
at the transmitter, switching it 
on to warm up, checking and balancing dials. Jacob Luke of the 
Times moved softly to stand behind his right shoulder, hoping 
he could be useful. Nathen made 
a half motion of his head, as if 
to glance back at him, unhooked 
two of the earphone sets hanging 
on the side of the tall streamlined 
box that was the automatic translator, plugged them in and handed one back over his shoulder to 
the Times man. 

The voice began to come from 
'the speaker again. 

Hastily, Jacob Luke fitted the 
earphones over his ears. He fancied he could hear Bud's voice 
tremble. For a moment it was 
just Bud's voice speaking the 
alien language, and then, very 
distant and clear in his earphones, 
he heard the recorded voice of the 
linguist say an English word, 
then a mechanical click and another clear word in the voice of 



one of the other translators, then 
another as the alien's voice flowed 
from the loudspeaker, the cool 
single words barely audible, overlapping and blending with it like 
translating thought, skipping unfamiliar words, yet quite astontshingly clear. 

"Radar shows no buildings or 
civilization near.. The atmosphere 
around us registers as thick as 
glue. Tremendous gas pressure, 
low gravity, no light at all. You 
didn't describe it like this. Where 
are you, Joe? This isn't -some 
kind of trick, is it?" Bud hesitated, was prompted by a deeper 
official voice and jerked out the 
words. 

"If it is a trick, we are ready 
to repel attack." 

THE linguist stood listening. 
He whitened slowly and beckoned the other linguists over to 
him and whispered to them. 
. Joseph Nathen looked at them 
with unwarranted bitter hostility 
while he picked up the hand-mike, 
plugging it into the translator. 
"Joe calling," he said quietly 
into it in clear, slow English. "No 
trick. We don't know where you 
are. I am trying to get a direction 
fix from your signal. Describe 
your surroundings to us if at all 
possible.** 

Nearby, the floodlights biased 
steadily on the television platform, ready for the official wel

come of the aliens to Earth. The 
television channels of the world 
had been alerted to set aside 
their scheduled programs for an 
unscheduled great event. In the 
long room the people waited, listening for the swelling sound of 
rocket jets. 

This time, after the light came 
on, there was a long delay. The 
speaker sputtered, and sputtered 
again, building to a steady 
scratching they could barely sense 
a dim voice. It came through 
in a few tinny words end 
then wavered back to inaudibility. 
The machine translated in their 
earphones. 

"Tried. . . seemed. . .repair. . .** 
Suddenly it came in clearly. 
"Can't tell if the auxiliary blew, 
too. Will try it. We might pick 
you up clearly on the next try. 
I have the volume down. Where 
is the landing port? Repeat. 
Where is the landing port? Where 
are you?" 

Nathen put down the handmike and carefully set a dial on 
the recording box, and flipped a 
switch, speaking over his shoulder. "This sets it to repeat what 
I said the last time. It keeps repeating." Then he sat with unnatural stillness, his head still 
half turned, as if he had suddenly 
caught a glimpse of answer and 
was trying with no success whatever to grasp it. 

The green warning light cut in. 



the recording clicked and the 
playback of Bud's face and voice 
appeared on the screen. 

"We heard a few words, Joe, 
and then the receiver blew again. 
We're adjusting a viewing screen 
to pick up the long waves that go 
through the murk and convert 
them to visible light. We'll be 
able to see out soon. The engineer says that something is 
wrong with the stern jets, and the 
captain has had me broadcast a 
help call to our nearest space 
base." He made the mouth O of 
a grin. "The message won't reach 
it for some years. I trust you, 
Joe, but get us out of here, will 
you? — They're buzzing that the 
screen is finally ready. Hold 
everything." 




'HE screen went gray, and the 
green light went off. 



The Times considered the lag 
required for the help call, the 
speaking and recording of the 
message just received, the time 
needed to reconvert a viewing 
screen. 

"They work fast." He shifted 
uneasily, and added at random, 
"Something wrong with the time 
factor. All wrong. They work 
too fast." 

The green light came on again 
immediately. Nathen half turned 
to him, sliding his words hastily 
into the gap of time as the message was recorded and slowed. 



PICTURES DON'T LIE

"They're close enough for our 
transmission power to blow their 
receiver." 

If it was on Earth, why the 
darkness around the ship? 
"Maybe they see in the high 
ultra - violet — the atmosphere 
is opaque to that band," the 
Times suggested hastily as the 
speaker began to talk in the 
young extraterrestrial's voice. 

It was shaking now. "Stand by 
for the description." 

They tensed, waiting. The 
Times brought a map of the 
state before his mind's eye. 

"A half circle of cliffs around 
the horizon. A wide muddy lake 
swarming with swimming things. 
Huge, strange white foliage all 
around the ship and incredibly 
huge pulpy monsters attacking 
and eating each other on all sides. 
We almost landed in the lake, 
right on the soft edge. The mud 
can't hold the ship's weight, and 
we're sinking. The engineer says 
we might be able to blast free, 
but the tubes are mud-clogged 
and might blow up the ship. 
When can you reach us?" 

The Times thought vaguely of 
the Carboniferous Era. Nathen 
obviously had seen something he 
had not. 

"Where are they?" the Times 
asked him quietly. 

Nathen pointed to the antenna 
position indicators. The Times 
let his eyes follow the converging 



imaginary lines of focus out the 
window to the sunlit airfield, the 
empty airfield, the drying concrete and green waving grass 
where the lines met. 

Where the lines met. The spaceship was there! 

The fear of something unknown gripped him suddenly. 

The spaceship was broadcasting again. "Where are you? Answer if possible! We are sinking! 
Where are you?" 

He saw that Nathen knew. 
"What is it?" the Times asked 
hoarsely. "Are they in another 
dimension or the past or on another world or what?" 

Nathen was smiling bitterly, 
and Jacob Luke remembered that 
the young man had a friend in 
that spaceship. "My guess is that 
they evolved on a high-gravity 
planet, with a thin atmosphere, 
near a blue-white star. Sure they 
see in the ultra-violet range. Our 
sun is abnormally small and dim 
and yellow. Our atmosphere is 
so thick, it screens out ultra-violet." He laughed harshly. "A 
good joke on us. the weird place 
we evolved in, the thing it did to 
us!" 

"Where are you?" called the 
alien spaceship. "Hurry, please! 
We're sinking!" 

THE decoder slowed his tumbled, frightened words and 
looked up into the Times' face 



no 




 



for understanding. "We'll rescue 
them,'* he said quietly. "YouT* 
were right about the time factor, 
right about them moving at a 
different speed. I misunderstood. 
This business about squawk coding, speeding for better transmission to counteract beam waver — I was wrong." 

"What do you mean?" 

"They don't speed up their 
broadcasts." 

"They don't—?" 

Suddenly, in his mind's eye, 
the Times began to see again the 
play he had just seen — but the 
actors were moving at blurring 
speed, the words jerking out in a 
fluting, dizzying stream, thoughts 
and decisions passing with unfollowable rapidity, rippling faces 
in a twisting blur of expressions, 
doors slamming wildly, shatteringly, as the actors leaped in and 
out of rooms. 

No — faster, faster ■ — he wasn't visualizing it as rapidly as it 
was, an hour of talk and action 
in one almost instantaneous 



"squawk," a narrow peak of 
"noise" interfering with a single 
word in an Earth broadcast! Faster — faster — it was impossible. 
Matter could not stand such 
stress — inertia — momentum — 
abrupt weight. 

It was insane. "Why?" he asked. '"How?" 

Nathen laughed again harshly, 
reaching for the mike. "Get them 
out? There isn't a lake or river 
within hundreds of miles from 
here!" 

A shiver of unreality went 
down the Times' spine. Automatically and inanely, he found himself delving in his pocket for a 
cigarette while he tried to grasp 
what had happened. "Where are 
they, then? Why can't we see 
their spaceship?"' 

Nathen switched the microphone on in a gesture that showed the bitterness of his disappointment. 

"We'll need a magnifying glass 
for that."

Nothing could have seemed pleasanter than that 
peaceful planet. Then why was a non-suicidal 
man driven to suicide there? Yet it made sense.

Templin tightened his 
safety belt and lay back on the 
acceleration bunk. The lights in 
the cabin dimmed to a .dull, red 
glow that meant the time for 



takeoff was ncaring. He could 
hear noises from deep within the 
ship and the tfny whir of the ventilator fan, filling the air with the 
sweetish smell of sleeping gas. 
To sleep the trip away was better 
than to face the dull monotony

of the stars for days on end. 

Oh, they kill themselves for lots 
of reasons. Maybe ill health or 
Hnantial messes or family difficulties. An unhapy love affair. Or 
more complex ones, ii you went 
into it deeper. The failure to 
achieve ait ambition, failure to 
live up to one's own ideals. Weltschmerz, perhaps. 

He could smell the bitter fragrance of tobacco smoke mingling 
with the gas. Eckert had lit a 
cigarette and was calmly blowing 
the smoke at the neon "No Smoking" sign, which winked on and 
off in mechanical disapproval. 

He turned his head slightly so 
he could just see Eckert in the 
bank facing him. Eckert, one of 
the good gray men in the Service. 
The old reliables, the ones who 
could take almost anything in 
their stride because, at one time 
or another, they had had to. 

It was Eckert who had come 
into his office several days ago 
and told him that Don Pendleton 
had killed himself. 

Only Pendleton wasn't the type. 
He was the kind who have everything to live for, the kind you instinctively know will amount to 
something someday. And that was 
a lousy way to remember him. 
The cliches always come first. 
Your memory plays traitor and 
hoils friendship down to the status 
of a breakfast food testimonial. 
The soft red lights seemed to 



be dancing in the darkness of the 
cabin. Eckert was j ust a dull, 
formless blur opposite him. His 
cigarette was out. 

Eckert had come into his office 
without saying a word and had 
watched his scenery-window. It 
had been snowing in the window, 
the white flakes making a simple 
pattern drifting past the glass. 
Eckert had fiddled with the controls and changed it to sunshine, 
then to a weird mixture of hail 
amid the brassy, golden sunlight. 

And then Eckert had told him 
that Pendleton had taken the 
short way out. 

He shouldn't get sentimental. 
But how the hell else should he 
remember Pendleton? Try to forget it and drink a toast to him at 
the nex/ class reunion? And never, 
never be so crude as to speculate 
why Pendleton should have done 
it? If, of course, he had . . . 

The cabin was hazy in the reddish glow, the sleeping gas a 
heavy perfume. 

Eckert and he had talked it out 
and gone over the records. Pendleton had come of good stock. 
There had been no mental instaJ bility in his family for as far back 
as the genetic records went. He 
had been raised in a middle-class 
neighborhood and attended a 
local grammar school where he 
had achieved average grades and 
had given his instructors the normal amount of trouble. Later, 



124 




 



when he had made up his mind to 
enter the Diplomatic Service, his 
grades had improved. He had 
worked hard at it, though he 
wasn't what you would call a 
grind. In high school and later in 
college, he was the well-balanced 
type, athletic, popular, hardworking. 

How long would it be before 
memories faded and all there tvas 
left of Pendleton was a page of 
statistics? He had been on this 
team, he had been elected president of that, he had graduated 
with such and such honors. But 
try getting a picture of him by 
reading the records, resurrect him 
from a page of black print. Would 
he be human? Would he be flesh 
and blood? Hell, no! In the statistics Pendleton was the AilAround Boy, the cold marble 
statue with the finely chiseled 
muscles and the smooth, blank 
sockets where the eyes should be. 
Maybe someday fate would play 
a trick on a hero-worshiping public and there would actually be 
kids like that. But they wouldn't 
be human; they wouldn't be born. 
Parents would get them by sending in so many box tops. 

He was drowsy; the room was 
filled with the gas now. It would 
be only a matter of minutes before he would be asleep. 

Pendleton had been in his second year as attache on Tunpesh. 
a small planet with a G-type sun. 



The Service had stumbled across 
it recently and decided the system 
was worth diplomatic recognition 
of some kind, so Pendleton had 
been sent there. He had been the 
first attache to be sent and naturally he had gone alone. 

There was no need to send 
more. Tunpesh had [ been inspected and certified and approved. The natives were primitive and friendly. Or maybe the 
Service had slipped up, as it 
sometimes did, and Tunpesh had 
received something less than a 
thorough survey. 

And then an unscheduled 
freighter had put in for repairs, 
one of the very few ships that 
ever came by Tunpesh. The captain had tried to pay his respects 
to Pendleton. Only Pendleton 
wasn't there. The natives said he 
had killed himself and showed 
the captain the little flower-covered plot where they had buried 
him. 

Tunpesh had been Pendleton's 
second assignment. 

The natives were oh-so-friendly. So friendly that he had made 
sure that a certain box was on 
board, filled with shiny atomic 
rifles, needle pistols, and the fat 
little gas guns. They might be 
needed. People like Pendleton 
didn't kill themselves, did they? 
No, they didn't. But sometimes 
they were murdered. 

It was almost black inside the 



THE FIRE AND THE SWOIV 



US 



cabin now; only a thin red line 
around the ceiling told how close 
they were to takeoff. His head 
was thick with drowsiness, his 
eyelids a heavy weight that he 
knew he couldn't keep open much 
longer. 

Eckert and he had been chosen 
to go to Tunpesh and investigate. 
The two of them, working together, should be able to find out 
Why Pendleton had killed himself. 

But that wasn't the real reason. 
Maybe Eckert thought so, but he 
knew better. The real reason they 
were going there was to find out 
why Pendleton had been killed 
and who had killed him. That 
was it. 

Who had killed Cock Robin? 

The thin red line was practically microscopic now and Templin could feel his lashes lying 
gently on his cheeks. But he 
wasn't asleep — not quite. There 
was something buzzing about hi 
the dim recesses of his mind. 

Their information on Tunpesh 
was limited. They knew that it 
had no trading concessions or 
armed forces and that nobody 
from neighboring systems seemed 
to know much about it or even 
visited it. But a staff anthropologist must have been routinely assigned to Tunpesh to furnish data 
and reports. 

"Ted?" he murmured sleepily. 

A faint stirring in the black 
bulk opposite him. "Yes?" 

126 



"How come our anthropologist 
on Tunpesh didn't come across 
with more information?" 

A drowsy mumble from the 
other cot: "He wasn't there long 
enough. He committed suicide not 
long after landing." 

The room was a whirling pool 
of blackness into which his mind 
was slowly slipping. Takeoff was 
only seconds away. 

Why do people commit suicide? 

"TT'S a nice day, isn't it, Ted?" 

-*- Eckert took a deep and 
pleasurable breath. "It's the type 
of day that makes you feel good 
just to be alive." 

Warm breezes rustled through 
Eckert's graying hair and tugged 
gently at his tunic. The air smelted as if it had been washed and 
faintly perfumed with the balrsamy scent of something very 
much like pine. A few hundred 
yards away, a forest towered 
straight and slim and coolly inviting, and brilliantly colored 
birds whirled and fluttered in the 
foliage. 

The rocketport, where they 
were standing surrounded by their 
luggage, was a grassy valley 
where the all too infrequent ships 
could land and discharge cargo 
or make repairs. There was a 
blackened patch on it now, with 
little blast-ignited flames dying 
out around the edges. It won't bo 
long before it will be green again, 

lALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



he thought. The grass looked as 
though it grew fast — it would certainly have plenty of time to grow 
before the next ship landed. 

He looked at the slim, dwindling shape that was the rocket, 
and was suddenly, acutely aware 
that he and Templin would be 
stranded for six months on a foreign and very possibly dangerous 
planet. And there would be no 
way of calling for help or of 
leaving before the six months were 
up. 

He stood there for a moment, . 
drinking in the fresh air and 
feeling the warmth of the sun 
against his face. It might be a 
pleasant six months at that, away 
from the din and the hustle and 
confusion, spending the time in a 
place where the sun was warm 
and inviting. 

/ must be getting old, he 
thought, thinking about the 
warmth and comfort. Like old 
dogs and octogenarians. * 

Templin was looking at the 
scenery with a disappointed expression on his face. Eckert stole 
a side glance at him and for a 
fleeting moment felt vaguely concerned. "Don't be disappointed if 
it doesn't look like cloak-anddagger right off, Ray. What stems 
innocent enough on the surface 
can prove to be quite dangerous 
underneath." 

"It's rather hard to think of 
danger in a setting like this." 



Eckert nodded agreement. "It 
wouldn't fit, would it? It would 
be like a famous singer suddenly 
doing a jazz number in an opera, 
or having the princess in a fairy 
tale turn out to be ugly." He gestured toward the village. "You 
could hardly class that as dangerous from its outward appearance, could you?" 

The rocketport was in a small 
valley, surrounded by tow, wooded hills. The village started where 
the port left off and crawled and 
wound over the wooded ridges. 
Small houses of sun-baked, whitewashed mud crouched in the 
shadow of huge trees and hugged 
the banks of a small stream. 

It looked fairly primitive, Eckert thought, and yet it didn't have 
the earmarks, the characteristics 
of most primitive villages. It 
didn't seem cluttered or dirty and 
you didn't feel like beating a 
hasty retreat when the wind was 
blowing toward you. 

A few adults were watching 
them curiously and the usual 
bunch of kids*that always congregated around rocketports 
quickly gathered. Eckert stared at 
them for a moment, wondering 
what it was that seemed odd 
about them, and they stared back 
with all the alert dignity of childhood. They finally came out on 
the field and clustered around 
him and Templin. 

Templin studied them warily. 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD

"Better watch them, Ted. Even 
kids can be dangerous." 

It's because you never suspect 
ttids, Eckert thought, you never 
think they'll do any harm. But 
they can be taught. They could 
do as much damage with a knife 
as a man could, for instance. And 
they might have other weapons. 

But the idea still didn't go with 
the warm sun and the blue sky 
and the piny scent of the trees. 

One of the adults of the village 
started to walk toward them. 

"The reception committee," 
Templin said tightly. His hand 
went inside his tunic. 

He couldn't be blamed for being jumpy, Eckert realized. This 
was his Brst time out, his first 
mission like this. And, of course, 
Pendleton had been a pretty good 
friend of his. 

"I'd be very careful what I 
did," Eckert said softly. "I would 
hate to start something merely 
because I misunderstood their intentions." 

The committee of one was a 
middle-aged man -dressed in a 
simple strip of white cloth twisted 
about his waist and allowed to 
hong freely to his knees. When he 
got closer, Eckert became less 
sure of his age. He had the firm, 
tanned musculature of a much 
younger man, though a slightly 
seamed face and white hair aged 
him somewhat. Eckert still had 
the feeling that if you wanted to 



know his exact age, you'd have 
to look at his teVth or know something about his epiphyseal closures. 

"You are menshars from 
Earth?" The voice was husky and 
pleasant and the pronunciation 
was very clear. Eckert regarded 
him thoughtfully and made a few 
mental notes. He wasn't bowing 
and scraping like most natives 
who weren't too familiar with visitors from the sky, and yet he was 
hardly either friendly or hostile. 

"You learned our language 
from Pendleton and Reynolds?" 
Reynolds had been the anthropologist. 

"We have had visitors from 
Earth before." He hesitated a moment and then offered his hand, 
somewhat shyly, Eckert thought, 
in the Terrestrial sign of greeting. "You may call me Jathong 
if you wish." He paused a moment to say something in his 
native^ tongue to the kids who 
were around. They promptly scattered and picked up the luggage. 
"While you are here, you will 
need a place to stay. There is one 
ready, if you will follow me." 

'He was polite, Eckert thought. 
He didn't ask what they were 
there for or how long they were 
going to stay. But then again, 
perhaps the natives were a better 
judge of that than he and Templin. 

The town was larger than he 



J28 



GAIAX-K SCIENCE FICTION 



had thought at first, stretching 
over a wide expanse of the countryside. There wasn't, so far as he 
could see, much manufacturing 
above the level of handicrafts and 
simple weaving. Colored patches 
on far hillsides indicated the presence of farms, and practically 
every house in the village had its 
small garden. 

What manufacturing there was 
seemed to be carried on in the 
central square of the town, where 
a few adults and children squatted in the warm afternoon sun 
and worked industriously at potter's wheels and weaver's looms. 
The other part of the square was 
given over to the native bazaar 
where pots and bolts of cloth were 
for sale, and where numerous 
stalls were loaded with dried 
fruits and vegetables and the 
cleaned and plucked carcasses of 
the local variety of fowl. 

It was late afternoon when they 
followed Jathong into a small, 
white-washed house midway up a 
hill. 

"You are free to use this while 
you are here," he said. 

Eckert and Templin took a 
quick tour of the few rooms. They 
were well furnished, in a rustic 
sort of way, and what modern 
conveniences they didn't have 
they could easily do without. The 
youngsters who had carried their 
luggage left it outside and quietly 
faded away. It was getting dark; 



Eckert opened one of the boxes 
they had brought along, took out 
an electric lantern and lighted it. 
He turned to Jathong. 

"You've been very kind to us 
and we would like to repay you. 
You may take what you wish of 
anything within this box." He 
opened another of the boxes and 
displayed the usual trade goods— 
brightly colored cloth and finely 
worked jewelry and a few mechanical contrivances that Eckert 
knew usually appealed to the 
primitive imagination. 

Jathong ran his hand over the 
cloth and held some of the jewelry up to the light. Eckert knew 
by the way he looked at it that 
he wasn't at all impressed. "I am 
grateful," he said finally, "but 
there is nothing I want." He 
turned and walked away into the 
gathering darkness. 

"The incorruptible native." 
Templin laughed sarcastically. 

Eckert shrugged. "That's one 
of the things you do out of habit, 
try and buy some of the natives 
so you'll have friends in case you 
need them." He stopped for a moment, thinking. "Did you notice 
the context? He didn't say he 
didn't want what we showed him. 
He said there was nothing that he 
wanted. Implying that everything 
he wanted, he already had." 

"That's not very typical of a 
primitive society, is it?" 

"No, I'm afraid it's not." Eck


THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



I2» 



ert started unpacking some of the 
boxes. "You know, Ray, I got a 
kick out of the kids. They're a 
healthy-looking lot, aren't they?" 

"Too healthy," Templin said. 
"There didn't seem to be any sick 
ones or ones with runny noses or 
cuts or black eyes or bruises. It 
doesn't seem natural." 

"They're probably just well 
brought-up kids," Eckert said 
sharply. "Maybe they've been 
taught not to get in fights or play 
around in the mud on the way 
home from school." He felt faintly 
irritated, annoyed af. the way 
Templin had put it, as if any deviation from an Earth norm was 
potentially dangerous. 

"Ted." Templin 's voice was 
strained. "This could be a trap, 
you know," 

"In what way?" 
The words came out slowly. 
"The people are too casual, as 
though they're playing a rehearsed part. Here we are, from 
an entirely different solar system, 
landed in what must be to them 
an unusual manner. They couldn't 
have seen rockets more than three 
or four times before. It should 
still be a novelty to them. And 
yet how much curiosity did they 
show? Hardly any. Was there any 
fear? No. And the cute, harmless 
little kids." He looked at Eckert. 
"Maybe that's what we're supposed to think — just an idyllic, 
harmless society. Maybe that's 



what Pendleton thought, right to 
the very end." 

He was keyed up, jumpy, Eckert realized. He would probably 
be seeing things in every shadow 
and imagining danger to be lurking around every corner. 

"It hasn't been established yet 
that Pendleton was killed, Ray. 
Let's keep an open mind until we 
know for certain." 

He nicked out the light and lay 
back on the cool bed, letting his 
body relax completely. The cool 
night wind blew lazily through 
the wood slat blinds, carrying the 
fragrance of the trees and the 
grass, and he inhaled deeply and 
let his thoughts wander for a moment. It was going to be pleasant 
to live on Tunpesh for six months 
— even if the six months were all 
they had to live. The climate was 
superb and the people seemed a 
cut above the usual primitive culture. If he ever retired some day, 
he thought suddenly, he would 
have to remember Tunpesh. It 
would be pleasant to spend his 
old age here. And the fishing was 
probably excellent . . . 

He turned his head a little to 
watch Templin get ready for bed. 
There were advantages in taking 
him along that Templin probably 
didn't even realize. He wondered 
what Templin would do if he ever 
found out that the actual reason 
he had been chosen to go was that 
his own psychological chart was 



130 




 



vey close to Pendleton's. Pendleton's own feelings and emotions 
would almost exactly be duplicated in Templin's. 

A few stray wisps of starlight 
pierced through the blinds and 
sparkled for an instant on a small 
metal box strapped to Templin's 
waist. A power pack, Eckert saw 
grimly, probably leading to the 
buttons on his tunic. A very convenient, portable, and hard to detect weapon. 

There were disadvantages in 
taking Templin, too. 




UST how primitive do you 
think the society is, Ted?" 



Eckert put down the chain he 
had been whittling and reached 
for his pipe and tobacco. 

"I don't think it's primitive at 
all. There are too many disparities. Their knowledge of a lot of 
things is a little more than empirical knowledge; they associate 
the growth of crops with fertilizer 
and nitrogen in the soil as well as 
sunlight, rather than the blessings 
of some native god. And they differ a lot in other respects. Their 
art and their music are advanced. 
Free art exists along with purely 
decorative art, and their techniques are finely developed." 

"I'm glad you agree, then. Take 
a look at this." Templin threw 
a shiny bit of metal on the roughhewn table. Eckert picked it up 
and inspected it. It was heavy and 



one side of it was extremely 
sharp. 

"What's it for?" 

"They've got a hospital set up 
here. Not a hospital like any we 
know, of course, but a hospital 
nonetheless. It's not used very 
much; apparently the natives 
don't get sick here. But occasionally there are hunting accidents 
and injuries that require surgery. 
The strip of metal there is a scalpel." He laughed shortly. "Primitive little gadget, but it works well 
— as well as any of ours." 

Eckert hefted it in his palm. 
"The most important tiling is that 
they have the knowledge to use 
it. Surgery isn't a simple science." 

"Well, what do you think about 
it?" 

"The obvious. They evidently 
have as much technology as they 
want, at least in fields where they 
have to have it." 

"How come they haven't gone 
any further?" 

"Why should they? You can 
live without sky cars and rocket 
ships, you know." 

"Did you ever wonder what 
kind of weapons they might 
have?" 

"The important thing." Eckert 
mused, "is not if they have them, 
but if they'd use them. And I 
rather doubt that they would. 
We've been here for two weeks 
now and they've been very kind 
to us, seeing that we've had food 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



13t 



end water and what fuel we 
need." 

"It's known in the livestock 
trade as being fattened up for the 
slaughter," Templeton said. 

Eckert sighed and watched a 
fat bug waddle across a small 
patch of sunlight on the wooden 
floor. It was bad enough drawing 
an assignment in a totally foreign 
culture, even if the natives were 
humanoid. It complicated things 
beyond all measure when your 
partner in the project seemed 
likely to turn into a vendettist. 
It meant that Eckert would have 
to split his energies. He'd have to 
do what investigating he could 
among the Tunpeshans, and he'd 
have to watch Templin to see that 
he didn't go off half-cocked and 
spoil everything. 

"You're convinced that Pendleton was murdered, aren't you?" 

Templin nodded. "Sure." 

"Why?" 

"The Tunpeshans know why 
we're here. We've dropped enough 
hints along those lines. But nobody has mentioned Pendleton; 
nobody has volunteered any information about him. And he was 
an attache here for three years. 
Didn't anybody know him during 
that time? We've let slip a few 
discreet statements that we would 
like to talk to Pendleton's friends, 
yet nobody's come around. Apparently, in all the three years he 
was here, Pendleton didn't make 



any friends. And that's a little 
hard to believe. It's more likely 
that his friends have been silenced and any information about 
him is being withheld for a reason." 

"What reason?" 

Templin shrugged. "Murder. 
What other reason could there 
be?" 

Eckert rolled up the thin, slatted blinds and stared out at the 
scenery. A hundred feet down the 
road, a native woman was going 
to market, leading a species of 
food animal by the halter. 

"They grow their women nice, 
don't they?" 

"Physically perfect, like the 
men," Templin grumbled. "You 
could get an inferiority complex 
just from watching the people 
here. Everybody's so damn perfect. Nobody's sick, nobody's unhealthy, nobody is too fat or too 
thin, nobody's unhappy. The only 
variation is that they don't all 
look alike. Perfection. It gets boring after a while." 

"Does it? I hadn't noticed." 
Eckert turned away from the 
blinds. His voice was crisp. "I 
knew Don Pendleton quite well, 
too," he said. "But it isn't blinding me to what I'm here for. We 
came to find out what happened 
to him, not to substantiate any 
preconceived notions. What we 
find out may be vitally important 
to anybody serving here in the 



132 




 



future. T would hate to see our 
efforts spoiled because you've already made up your mind." 

"You knew Pendleton," Templin repeated grimly. "Do you 
think it was suicide?" 

"1 don't think there's such a 
thing as a suicide type, when you 
come down to it. I'm not ruling 
out the possibility of murder, 
either. I'm trying to keep an open 
mind." 

"What have we accomplished 
so far? What have we found out?" 

"We've got six months." Eckert 
said quietly. "Six months in which 
we'll try to live here inconspicuously and study the people and 
try to cultivate informants. We 
would get nowhere if we came 
barging in asking all sorts of questions. And don't forget, Ray, 
we're all alone on Tuhpesh. If it 
is a case of murder, what happens 
when the natives Find out that we 
know it is?" 

Templin's eyes dueled for a 
moment. Then he turned his back 
and Valked to the window. "I 
suppose you're right," he said at 
last. "It's nice living here, Ted. 
Maybe I've been fighting it. But 
I can't help thinking that Don 
must have liked it here, too." 

f~VNE of the hardest things to 
learn in a foreign culture, 
Eckert thought, is when to enjoy 
yourself, when to work and when, 
to worry. 



"Pelache, menshar?** 

"Sharra!" He took the small 
bowl of pelache nuts, helped himself to a few, and passed the bowl 
on. This was definitely the time 
to enjoy himself, not to work or 
worry. He had heard about the 
halera a few days ago, and, by 
judicious hinting to the proper 
authorities, he and Templin had 
been invited. It was a good chance 
to observe native customs. A little 
anthropology — with refreshments. 

The main courses started making the rounds and he took generous helpings of the roasted 
ulami and the broiled halunch 
and numerous dabs from the side 
dishes of steaming vegetables. Between every course, they passed 

around a small flagon of the hot, 
spiced native wine, but he noticed 
that nobody drank to excess. 

The old Greek ideal, he 
thought : moderation in every* 
thing. 

He looked at Templin, sitting 
across from him in the huge circle, 
and shrugged mentally. Templin, 
looked as if he was about to break 
down and enjoy himself, but there 
was still a slight bulge under his 
tunic, where he had strapped hi$ 
power pack. Any fool should have 
known that nothing would happen at a banquet like this. The 
only actual danger lay in Templin's getting excited and doing 
something he was bound to regret 
later on. And even that danger 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



was not quite as likely now. 

There will be hell to pay, Eckert thought, if Templin ever finds 
out that I sabotaged his power 
pack. 

"You look thoughtful, menshar 
Eckert." 

Eckert took another sip of the 
wine and turned to the Tunpeshan 
on his left. He was a tall, muscular man with sharp eyes, a firm 
chin and a certain aura of author rty. 

"I was wondering if my coun. tryman Pendleton had offended 
your people in any way, Nayova." 
Now was as good a time as any 
to pump him for what he knew 
about Pendleton's death. 

"So far as I know, menshar 
Pendleton offended no one. I do 
not know what duties he had to 
perform here, but he was a generous and courteous man." 

Eckert gnawed the dainty meat 
off a slender ulami bone and tried 
to appear casual in his questioning. 

"I am sure he was, Nayova. I 
am sure, too, that you were as 
kind to him as you have been to 
Templin and myself. My Government is grateful to you for that." 

Nayova seemed pleased. "We 
tried to do as well for menshar 
Pendleton as we could. While he 
was here, he had the house that 
you have now and we saw that 
he was supplied with food and all 
other necessities." 



Eckert had a sudden clammy 
feeling which quickly passed 
away. What Nayova had said was 
something he'd make sure Templin never heard about. He wiped 
his mouth on a broad, flat leaf 
that had been provided and took 
another sip of the wine. 

"We were shocked to find out 
that menshar Pendleton had killed himself. We knew him quite 
well and we could not bring ourselves to believe he had done such 
a tiling." 

Nayova's gaze slid away from 
him. "Perhaps it was the will of 
the Great One," he said vaguely. 
He didn't seem anxious to talk 
about it. 

Eckert stared bleakly at his 
wine glass and tried to put the 
pieces of information together. 
They probably had a taboo about 
self - destruction which would 
make it difficult to talk about. 
That would make it even harder 
for him to find out by direct questioning. 

A native fife trilled shrilly and 
a group of young men and women 
walked into the room. The circle 
broke to let them through and 
they came and knelt before Nayova. When he clapped his hands 
sharply, they retreated to the center of the circle and began the 
slow motions of a native dance. 

The sound of the fife softened 
and died and the slow monotonous beat of drums took its place. 



134 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



The beat slowly increased and so 
did the rhythm of the dancers. 
The small fires at the comers of 
tlif hut were allowed to dwindle 
and the center of the circle became filled with the motions of 
shadows intermixed with the 
swift, sure movements of glistening limbs. Eckert felt his eyebrows crawl upward. Apparently 
the dance was the Tunpeshan version of the rites de passage. He 
glanced across the circle at Temptin.. Templin's face — what he 
could see of it by the flickering 
light — was brick red. 

A voice spoke in his ear. "It is 
hard for us to imagine anybody 
doing what menshar Pendleton 
did. It is . . ." andtie used a native 
word that Eckert translated as 
being roughly equivalent to "obscene." 

The dancers at the center of the 
circle finally bowed out with 
small garlands of flowers on their 
heads that signified their reaching 
adulthood. Acrobats then took the 
stage and went throuh a dizzying routine, and they in turn were 
succeeded by a native singer. 

They were all excellent, Eckert 
thought. If anything, they were 
too good. 

The bowl of pelache nuts made 
its way around again and Nayova 
leaned over to speak to him. "If 
there is any possibility that I can 
help you while you are here, mens/iar Eckert, you have but to ask." 



It would probably be a mistake 
to ask for a list of Pendleton's 
friends, but there was a way 
around that. "I would like to meet 
any of your people who had dealings with Pendleton, either in business or socially. I will do everything not to inconvenience them 
in any way." 

"I think they would be glad to 
help you. I shall ask them to go 
to you this coming week." 

IT wasn't a driving rain, just a 
gentle drizzle that made the 
lanes muddy and plastered Eckert's tunic against him. He didn't 
mind it; the rain was warm and 
the trees and grass smelted good 
in the wet. 

"How would you classify the 
culture after seeing the ceremony, 
Ted?" Templin asked. 

"About what you would expect. 
An Apollonian culture, simple 
and dignified. Nothing in. excess, 
no striving for great emotional 
release." # 

Templin nodded soberly. "It 
grows on you, doesn't it? You 
find yourself getting to like the 
place. And I suppose that's dangerous, too. You tend to let your 
guard down, the way Pendleton 
must have. You — what was that?" 

Eckert tensed. There was a gentle padding in the mud, several 
hundred feet behind them. Templin flattened himself in the shadows alongside a house. His hand 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



135 



darted inside his tunic and came 
out with the slim deadliness of a 
needle gun. 

"Don't use it !" Eckert whispered tersely. 

Templin's eyes were thin, 
frightened slits in the darkness. 
"Why not?" 

Eckert's mind raced. It might 
be nothing at all, and then again 
it might be disaster. But there 
was still a chance that Templin 
might be wrong. And there were 
more immediate reasons. 

"How many charges do you 
have for that?" 

"Twelve." 

"You think you can stand there 
and hold them off with only 
twelve charges for your needle 
gun?" 

"There's my power pack." 



"It's no good," Eckert said softly. "The batteries in it are dead. 
I was afraid you might do something foolish with it." 

The footsteps were only yards 
away. He listened intently, but it 
was hard to tell how many there 
were by the sound. 

"What do we do then?" 

"See if they're following us 
fi rst,' ' Eckert said practically. 
''They might not be, you know." 

They slid out from the shadows 
and ducked down another lane 
between the houses. The footsteps 
behind them speeded up and came 
down the same lane. 

"We'll have to head back for 
our house," Eckert whispered. 

They started running as quietly 
as they could, slipping and sliding in the mud. Another stretch 





 



past the shuttered, crouching 
houses and they found themselves 
in the square they had visited on 
the day they had landed. It was 
deserted, the looms and pottery 
wheels covered with cloth and 
reeds to keep off the rain. They 
darted across it, two thin shadows 
racing across the open plaza, and 
hurried down another path. 



The last path led to the small 
river that cut through the city. 
Templin looked around, gestured 
to Eckert, waded into the water 
and crouched under the small 
bridge that spanmed it. Eckert 
swore silently to himself, then followed Templin in. 

The cold water swirled under 
his armpits and he bit his lips to 




THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



137 



keep himself from sneezing. 
Templin's emotions were contagious. Would he have worried 
about the footsteps? He frowned 
and tried to be honest with himself. Perhaps he would — and perhaps he wouldn't have. But he 
couldn't have let Templin stay 
there and face the unknown ap-' 
proachers. Not Templin. 

Footsteps approached the 
« bridge, hesitated a moment, then 
pattered on the wooden structure 
and faded off down the muddy 
path. Eckert let his breath out 
slowly. The footsteps were curiously light. 

There was only one pair of 
them . 

"¥ WOULD like to know some■* thing," Templin said coldly. 
He stripped off his power pack 
and let it fall to the floor of their 
house. "Why did you decide to 
substitute dead batteries in the 
pack?" 

"Because," Eckert said shortly, 
"I was afraid you would do something with it that you might regret later. You're inexperienced in 
situations like this. Your reactions 
aren't to be trusted. One false 
move here and we could follow 
Pendleton, however he died. You 
know that." He wriggled out of 
his tunic and slowly peeled off his 
wet trousers. 

There was a timid knock at the 
door. He wrapped a blanket about 



himself and motioned to Templin 
to stand to one side. Templin 
grabbed a small stool, hefted it 
in one hand, and complied. 

Eckert went to the door and 
casually threw it open. 

A girl stood there, half in the 
outer darkness and half in the 
yellowish light from the room, 
covered with mud to the knees 
and drenched to the skin. 

"The menshar forgot this at the 
halera," she said joftly. She 
quickly handed him his pipe and 
a soggy bag of tobacco, and disappeared instantly into the rain. 
He listened for the sound of her 
footsteps in the soft mud and 
then closed the door. 

Templin put down the stool 
and stared stupidly at the pipe 
and the tobacco sack. Eckert 
placed them carefully on the table 
and began to towel himself. 

"We probably face as much 
danger from our own imaginations as from anything else." he 
said grimly. "Tell me, would you 
have fired first, or would you have 
waited until you found out for 
sure who she was and what she 
wanted when she first started to 
follow us?" 

"I don't know," Templin said 
sullenly. 

"Then I'll leave to your imagination the position we would be 
in now, if you had given in to 
your impulse." 



f33 




 



""VT7E haven't found out much, 

** have we?" Templin demanded some days later. 

"No," Eckert admitted. "We 
haven't." 

He riffled through the thick 
stack of cards on the table. Statistically, the results were not only 
interesting but slightly phenomenal. During the three years or 
so that Pendleton had been on 
Tunpesh, he had met and known 
approximately seven hundred of 
the natives. By far the greater 
majority of these, of course, were 
purely casual and meant nothing. Almost a hundred, though, 
had had extended relations with 
Pendleton in business or social 
affairs. Of this hundred, none — 
not a single one — would admit 
that he had known Pendleton well 
or could be considered a friend of 
his. About all they had to say 
was that Pendleton had been 
healthy and easy to get along 
with, and one warm night he had 
shocked the community by going 
off and shooting himself. 

"Like Richard Cory," Eckert 
said aloud. * 

"Like who?" Templin asked. 

"Richard Cory. A character in 
a poem by a Twentieth Century 
poet, Edwin Arlington Robinson. 
Apparently he had everything to 
live for, but 'Richard Cory, one 
calm summer night, went home 
and put a bullet through his 
head.' " 



'TH have to look it up some 
day," Templin said. He pointed 
to the stack of cards. "That's so 
much waste paper, isn't it?" 

"Yes, it is," Eckert said reluctantly. "To be frank, I had hoped 
we'd know a lot more by now. I 
still can't understand, why we 
haven't dug up anybody who will 
admit having been his friend." 

"How do you know they're telling the truth? Or, for that matter, 
how do you know that the ones 
we've seen so far are the ones who 
actually knew Pendleton?" 

Eckert drummed his fingers on 
the table. You handle different 
human cultures tor twenty-five 
years and you get to the point 
where you can tell if people are 
lying or not. Or do you? Maybe 
just an old man's conceit. Age 
alone never lent wisdom. Regardless of the personal reasons that 
Templin might have for thinking 
the Tunpeshans are lying, the fact 
remains that they very easily 
could be. And what should you do 
if they are? 

There was a polite knock at the 
door. 

"We've got another visitor," 
Templin said sarcastically. "He 
probably saw Pendleton at a halera four years ago and wants to 
be sure we know all about it." 

The Tunpeshan looked faintly 
familiar to Eckert. There was 
something about the man's carriage . . • 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



139 



"I met you the day you landed," the Tunpeshan began, and 
Eckert remembered. Jathong, the 
guide who had shown them to the 
house. 

"You knew Pendleton?" 

Jathong nodded. "I and a fellow weaver took over his small 
office after he had left it." Eckert 
recalled the small office in the 
square with the bolts of cloth on 
display, and the small mud brick 
on the window ledge with the incised lettering reading: 

DONALD PENDLETON. SERVICE ATTACHE. 

"Why you didn't tell us this 
before?" 

"I didn't know what kind and 
how much information you wanted.*' 

We didn't ask him, Eckert 
thought, so he didn't vofuntepr 
any information. Polite, to say the 
least. 

"How long did you know him?" 

"Since he landed. I was the one 
appointed to him." 

"What do you mean — appointed to him?" 

"To try to learn his language, 
and try to teach him ours." 

Eckert felt his interest rising. 
Jathong, then, must have known 
Pendleton fairly well. 

"Did he have any enemies that 
you know of?" 

"Enemies?" Jathong seemed ignorant of , the meaning of the 
word, so Eckert explained. "No, 



he had no enemies. He would 
naturally have none such on 
Tunpesh." 

Templin leaned forward, tense. 
"If he had no enemies, why did 
he have no friends? You, for example, knew him longer and better than most. Why is it that you 
weren't his friend?" 

Jathong looked unhappy, as if 
being forced to say something he 
wanted not to say. "Pendleton 
was kava — 1 cannot explain it. 
The concept is difficult. You 
would not understand." 

He might be running the danger of throwing too many questions at Jath'ong, Eckert 'realized, 
and having him freeze up or turn 
vague. But it couldn't be helped. 
They had made no progress at all 
by subtlety, and time would eventually run out. 

He tried to broach the next 
question delicately. "Did Pendleton know any of the women of 
your race?" 

"'He knew some of the women, 
as he knew the men." 

The answer didn't tell Eckert 
what he wante'd to know. "Was he 
in love with any woman?" It 
sounded crude the way he put it, 
but it was hard to think of any 
other way of asking it. 

JATHONG looked at him incredulously, as if Eckert had 
asked him if Pendleton had had 
two heads. 



140 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



"That would have been impossible. None of our women would 
have — could have — been in love 
with menshar Pendleton." 

One line of inquiry /US* gone 
phht, Eckert thought. But Pendleton wasn't one to let a broken 
heart get him down anyway. 

"Why not?" Templin cut in 
harshly. "He wasn't hard to look 
at and he would have made a 
good husband." 

Jathong diplomatically turned 
around to face Templin. "I have 
told you once — Pendleton was 
Itava. It would have been quite 
impossible" 

The answer to what had happened to Pendleton probably lay 
in Jathong's inability to explain 
his own terms, Eckert believed. 
One could get just so close, and 
then the definitions became vague 
and useless. 

He asked a few more questions 
and finally dismissed Jathong. 
The interview, like all the others 
he and Templin had held during 
the last week, had been worthless. 
They knew nothing more than 
they had when they landed, 

"I still thing they're lying," 
Templin said almost savagely. 
"Or perhaps the ones who really 
know something haven't come 
around." 

PACKER T got his pipe and sat 
near the doorway, letting the 
sunlight streaming through the 



foliage of a nearby tree dapple 
his face with a checkerboard pattern of modulated lights and velvety shadows. 

"If they're evading us or if 
they're lying, then the society is 
a dangerous one for us. But I still 
can't believe it. They're not warlike. They don't seem to have 
many weapons and definitely 
none of an advanced type." 

"How could anybody know for 
sure?" 

Eckert methodically knocked 
the cold ashes out of his pipe and 
added more tobacco. "Easy. Despite what you read in story 
books, no civilization lives simply, 
governs itself simply, and yet possesses 'super-blasters.' The swordand - blaster combination just 
doesn't exist. Any weapon above 
the level of bows and arrows or 
knives is the product of a well advanced technology. Along with 
weapons, of course, you have to 
have good communications. Now 
take an ordinary radio and think 
of the degree of knowledge, technology, and industrialization that 
would have to exist to supply it. 
There's nothing like that here." 

Templin came over to the 
warmth streaming in through the 
doorway. "It almost seems that 
they're acting in concert, though 
— as if there were some kind of 
plot, where, by prearrangement, 
everybody knows exactly what to 
say." 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORO 



141 



"You're wrong again. You can 
practically smell a dictatorship or 
a tyranny, which is the only situation in which almost one hundred 
per cent of the population will follow the same line through fear of 
the consequences if they don't. In 
a situation like that, the people 
are frightened, unhappy. You can 
hardly say that's the case on Tunpesh." 

"No," Templin admitted, "you 
couldn't. But, still, you have to 
admit that the answers we've received so far are just too unanimous — and too sketchy. All agree 
that Pendleton was a fine fellow; 
alt agree that he had no native 
friends." 

Eckert nodded. "I'll go along 
with that. And I think it's time 
we did something about it. Tonight we'll have to start eliminating certain ideas." 

He took a small case from their 
pile of luggage and opened it. Inside was a small, battery-powered 
box with various dials set on the 
front and the usual electrodes and 
nerve probes protruding from the 
sides and the top. 

Templin looked at it with surprise. 

"That will be dangerous to use, 
won't it?" 

"It might be more dangerous 
not to. Time is getting to be a 
factor and we have to make some 
progress. We have a safety margin 
of a sort in that we can erase 



memories of its use, but the procedure is still risky." 

"Who do we use it on?" 

"As long as we're going to use 
it," Eckert said grimly, "we might 
as well start at the top." 

When they had started out, the 
investigation had seemed fairly 
simple to Eckert. There were two 
possibilities — either Pendleton 
had committed suicide or he had 
been murdered. Knowing Pendleton's record, the first possibility 
had seemed remote. A few weeks 
on Tunpesh had convinced htm 
that the second possibility was 
also remote. One or the other had 
to be eliminated. The second 
would be the easiest. 

There were other reasons as 
well. Templin was still convinced 
that Pendleton had been killed, 
and Templin was an emotional 
man with access to powerful 
weapons. The question was not 
what he might eventually do, but 
when. 

THE night looked as if it would 
be another rainy one. It was 
cooler than usual and dark clouds 
were scudding across the starlit 
sky. Eckert and Templin stood 
in the shadows of the house, 
watching the dark lane for any 
casual strollers. Eckert looked at 
his watch. A few minutes more 
and Nayova would come out for 
his evening walk. 

Eckert had just started to think 



Ml 




 



longingly of his bed and the 
warmth inside his house when the 
door opened and Nayova appeared in the opening. Eckert held 
his breath while the chieftain 
stood uncertainly in the doorway, 
testing the night air, and then let 
it out slowly when Nayova started 
down the lane. 

They closed in on him. 

"The menshars from Earth," 
he said without alarm. "Is there 
something you wish?" 

"We would like you to come 
with us to our house for a while," 
Eckert started in. 

Nayova looked puzzled. "I do 
not understand. Would not tomorrow do as well?" 

"I'm afraid it'll have to be tonight." 

Nayova was obviously not quite 
sure of their threat. 
"No, I . . ." 

Eckert caught him before he 
touched the ground. Templin took 
the rag off the butt of the needle 
gun, lifted the ruler's feet, and 
they disappeared into the brush 
along the lane. 

They would have to sneak back 
to the house, Eckert knew, and 
hope that nobody saw them lugging the unconscious native. He 
laughed a little grimly to himself. 
Templin had expected cloak-anddagger. It looked as if he was 
going to get more than his share 
of it, after all. 

Once inside the house, Eckert 



arranged the electrodes and the 
small nerve probes on Nayova, 
who had come to. 

"I am sorry,*' Eckert said formally," but we find this necessary. 
You understand that we have to 
find out all we can about Pendleton. We have no choice." 

He found it difficult to look the 
ruler in the face, even with the 
realization that this was strictly 
in the line of duty and that the 
chieftain would not be hurt. 

"But I have cooperated with 
you in every way possible!" Nayova protested. "I have told you 
everything we know!" 

"That's right," Templin said 
bluntly, "And now we're going to 
ask you the same questions." 

Nayova looked blank for a moment and then reddened as he 
understood. 




IEMPL1N turned to the dials 
on the little square box. 



"We would like to know," Eckert said politely, "where you were 
two weeks ago at this time of 
night." 

Nayova looked surprised. "You 
know that I was at the ha/era, 
the coming-of-age ceremony. You 
were there with me, as my guests. 
You should assuredly know I was 
there." 

Eckert looked over at Templin, 
who nodded shortly. It had been 
a standard question, to test the 
apparatus. 



THE FIEE AND THE SWOID 



143 



"Did Pendleton have any enemies here on Tunpesh?" 

Nayova emphatically shook his 
head. "To the best of my knowledge, menshar Pendleton had no 
enemies here. He would have 
none." 

Templin's face showed its disappointment. 

"Who were his friends?" 

"He had no friends." 

Templin glowered angrily, but 
he said nothing. 

Eckert frowned. The same answer — Pendleton had had no enemies and yet he had had no 
friends. 

"Would you say he was well 
liked here?" 

"I would say no." 
"Why not?" 

A shrug. "It is hard to explain 
and you would not be able to 
understand." 

"Did somebody here kill Pendleton?" 

Eckert could hear Templin 
suck in his breath. 

"No." 

''Ask him that again," Templin 
cut in. 

"Did somebody kill Pendleton?" 
J'No." 

''Did Pendleton kill himself?" 
A trace of disgust showed on 
Nayova's face. 
"Yes." 
"V?hy?" 

"I do not know." 



Templin gestured to Eckert to 
take the box. "Let me ask him." 
He came around and faced the 
native. "Why did your people kilt 
Pendleton?" 

"We did not kill him. We had 
no reason to wish him harm." 

"Do you expect us- to believe 
that Pendleton killed himself? We 
knew him better than that." 

"You may believe whatever 
you wish. But men change and 
perhaps he did. We did not kill 
him. Such an act would have been 
repugnant to us." 

"I think that's enough," Eckert 
said calmly. 

Templin bit his lip as Eckert 
touched another dial on the machine. Nayova suddenly jerked, 
looked blank, and slumped in the 
chair. 

Eckert took off the electrodes. 
"Help me take him back, will 
you, Ray?" 

^T^HEY carried Nayova to his 
house, stayed with him until 
he showed signs of recovering, and 
then left. 

"Why didn't you use a drug?" 
Templin demanded. 

"Possible allergy or serum reaction. We don't know enough 
about these people to take 
chances — they're humanoid, not 
human." 

"They can fool machines, 
though, can't they?" 

Eckert didn't reply. 



144 




 



"All right, I know they can't," 
Tcmplin sai<J grudgingly. "He 
was telling the truth all the time, 
wasn't he?" 

Eckert nodded. "I never did 
think he was lying. They don't 
seem to be the type; their culture 
doesn't allow for it." 

They were silent for a while, 
walking quietly in the lanes between the shuttered , seem ingly 
untenanted houses. 

"I'm glad," Templin said quietly. "It's off my mind. It's hard 
to believe that anybody here 
would . . . deliberately kill somebody else." 

Templin's reactions would be 
worth something now for Eckert 
to study. They wouldn't be inhibited by his conviction that the 
natives had murdered his best 
friend. Just what reactions and 
emotions he would display, Eckert wasn't sure, nor how Templin's psychology, so similar to 
Pendleton's, would help solve the 
problem. 

They had eliminated one possibility, but that still left them 
with the one they had started 
with. 

Why had Pendleton taken the 
short way out? 

A BREEZE scampered through 
the open door and played tag 
with the papers on the desk. Eckert swore without annoyance and 
calmly started chasing those that 



had been blown on the floor. 

"What did Pendleton have to 
say in his reports?" Templin sat 
in the doorway, his eyes barely 
open. He had begun taking siestas 
in the early afternoon, after their 
usual light lunch. It was pleasant 
to sit on the worn wood and feel 
the warmth of sun and smell the 
crisp freshness of the outdoors, or 
maybe watch the kids playing in 
the lane, catching the butterflies 
that floated past in the afternoon 
air. 

"About what you'd expect. 
Mostly reports on the industry, 
climate, system of government, 
and general anthropological information that he thought might 
prove interesting. As far as I can 
see, he didn't lack enthusiasm for 
making the reports. If anything, 
he grew more enthusiastic as time 
went on. He practically wrote us 
treatises on every phase of life on 
Tunpesh." 

Templin's eyes closed all the 
way. 

"Any indication in his reports 
that he didn't like it here?" 

"Just the other way around. 
Everything points to the fact that 
he liked the climate, the people, 
the way they lived." 

"I don't blame him," Templin 
murmured. "This is a lovely place 
to be. The climate is wonderful, 
the people are happy, hard-working. The society itself seems to be 
— perfect. Sometimes you can't 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



M5 



help but compare it too damn 
favorably to Earth." 

Eckert shoved the papers to one 
side and came over to where 
Tempi in sat. He felt rather lazy 
himself. The warmth and sunshine rorroded ambition, as it did 
in most, climates like this. 

"You know, there isn't any 
crime here/' Templin continued. 
He laughed to himself. "Except 
the minor crime wave we caused 
when we landed here five months 
ago. No criminals, no villains foreclosing mortgages, no gamblers 
bleeding the gullible white, and 
nobody trying to sell gold bricks. 
I can't get over it." 

A BUTTERFLY flapped into 
the sunlight that glistened on 
his tunic, like a drop of water on a 
piece of black velvet. It hung 
there for a moment and then was 
off, its wings flashing. 

Eckert watched it go in a sort 
of torpor. It was pleasant to relax 
and slip the leash off your 
thoughts quietly and see where 
they took you. Maybe it was a 
sort of letdown. They had expected six months of danger in a 
potentially criminal culture, and 
instead it had been paradise. 

As Templin said, you couldn't 
help but compare it to Earth. No 
greed, no belligerency, no contempt for the rights of others. No 
cynicism, no sarcasm, and no 
trampling crowds in the stores. 



The little important things . . ■ 
"Where did you go last night, 
Ray?" 

Templin stirred. "A community 
meeting. Almost like a Quaker 
meeting. You get up and say what 
you think. The one last night was 
about some local government issues. They talked it over, decided 
what to do, and how much each 
person should contribute. The 
original democracy, Ted." 

Eckert was wide awake. "I 
wonder why I wasn't invited." He 
felt slightly put out that Templin 
should have been asked to something like that and he hadn't 
been. 

"I wasn't Invited." Templin 
said. "I invited myself." 

"Have you noticed," Eckert 
mused, "we haven't been invited 
to too many functions lately?" 

"They know we're busy," 
Templin said lazily. "They're too 
polite to ask us to go some place 
if they thought we were busy doing something else." 

"You like it here, don't you, 
Ray?" 

Templin brushed idly at a marauding mosquito. "It took me 
pretty long to warm up to it. but 
I guess I do." 

They only had a month left, 
Eckert knew — a month to do 
practically nothing but lie in the 
sun and watch the people. Oh, 
they could go through the motions of investigating and look 



146 




 



over Pendleton's old records and 
reports, but there was nothing in 
them of any value. 

He yawned and sat down and 
settled his back against the door 
frame. It began to look as if 
they'd never find out why Pendleton had done what he had. And 
it didn't seem to matter, somehow. 

I^CKERT opened the door 
-"- J slowly. Templin was asleep 
on the bed, the sunlight lying in 
bands across his tanned, bare 
back. He had on a strip of white 
cloth, knotted at the waist in 
imitation of what the natives 
wore. 

It was mussed now, and the 
knot had started to come loose. 

He looked a lot healthier than 
he had when they had first landed. More peaceful, more content. 
He appeared to have gained ten 
pounds and shed five years in the 
last six months. 

And now the vacation was over. 
It was time to go back. 

"Ray," Eckert called out to 
him softly. 

Templin didn't stir, but continued his soft and very regular 
breathing. 

Eckert found a book and dropped it on the floor with a thud. 
Templin woke up, but didn't 
move. 

"What do you want, Ted?" 
"How did you know it was me?" 



Templin chuckled, as if it were 
hugely funny. "Riddles yet. Who 
else would it be? No Tunpesnan 
would be rude enough to wake 
somebody up in the middle of anap, so it had to be you." 

"You know what you would 
have done if somebody had awakened you like that five months 
ago?" 

Templin tried to nod, but was 
slightly handicapped by the bed 
underneath him. "I would have 
pulled my trusty atomgun and 
plugged him." 

Eckert went over to where they 
kept their luggage and started 
pulling the boxes out from the 
wall. "Well, I've got good news 
for you. A liner just landed to 
pick us up. They were going 
through this sector and they got 
an order from the Service to stop 
by for us. Some cargo -wallopers 
will be here in a few minutes to, 
help us with our gear." 

"Ted." 

Eckert paused. 
"Yes?" 

"I'm not going back." 

"Why not?" Eckert's face had 
a look of almost clinical curiosity 
on it. 

"Why should I? I like it here. 
I want to live here the rest of my 
life." 

*|"*HE pieces began to fall in 
place. 

"I'm not so sure you'd like it. 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



M7 



Ray. Not after a while. All your 
friends are back on Earth. Everybody you know is back there. It's 
just the novelty of something new 
and something different here. I've 
felt that way a lot of times in 
different cultures and different societies. You'd change your mind 
after a while." 

"Those aren't reasons, Ted. 
Why should I go back to a world 
where most of the people are unhappy at some time and a few 
people all the time? As far as I'm 
concerned, Tunpesh is my home 
now. and I don't intend to leave 
it." 

Eckert was fascinated. It was 
like a case history unfolding right 
before his eyes. 

"Are you sure you would enjoy 
it here for the rest of your life? 
Have you made any friends to 
take the place of those back 
home?" 

"It takes time to become acquainted, even more time to make 
friends," Templin said defensive
ft 

"You can't desert the Service," 
Eckert pointed out. "You still 
have your duty." 

Templin laughed in his pillow. 
"It won't work, Ted. Duty's just 
a catch word, a jingo phrase. 
They can get along without me 
»nd you know it." 

"What about Pendleton, Ray?" 
He died here, you know, in mysterious circumstances." 



"Would going back help him 
any? He wasn't murdered; we 
know that. And why do people 
commit suicide? For what one of 
several thousand possible reasons 
did Pendleton? We don't know. 
We'll never know. And if we did 
know, what good would it do?" 




He had changed a lot in six 
months. Eckert saw. 
Too much. 

"What if I told you I knew 
why Pendleton killed himself?" 
Eckert asked. "And that you 
would do the same if you stayed 
here?" 

"Don't use it, Ted. It's poor 
psychology. It won't work." 



141 




 



The pieces made a perfect picture. But Templin was going back 
whether he wanted to or not. The 
only difficulty was that, deep underneath, Eckert sympathized 
with him. Perhaps if he had been 
younger, less experienced . . . 

"Then you won't go back with 
Us?" 

Templin closed his eyes and 
rolled over on his back. "No." 

There was dead silence. Templin could smell the piny scent of 
the woods and feel the warmth of 
soft sunlight that lanced through 
the blinds. Some place far away, 





there was the faint chatter of kids 
at play, but outside of that it was 
quiet. 

Too quiet. 

Templin opened his eyes in 
sudden alarm. "Ted! Don't!" He 
caught the gas full in the face and 
tumbled back on the bed, unconscious. 

UCKERT opened the hatch to 
* J the observation cabin as quietly as he could. Templin was 
seated on one of the pneumatic 
couches, staring soberly at a small 



THE FIRE AND THE SWORD 



I 19 



yellow star in the black sky. He 
didn't look up. 

"It's me, Ray," Eckert said. 

Templin didn't move. 

"I suppose I owe you an apology," Eckert began, "but I had to 
gas you to get you to leave. 
Otherwise you wouldn't have left. 
And the same thing would have 
happened to you that happened 
to Don Pendleton." 

"You're sure of that?" Templin 
asked bitterly. 

"Reasonably. You're a lot like 
Pendleton, you know. In fact, 
that's why you were selected to 
go — not so much because you 
knew him as the fact that psychologically you were a lot like 
him. We thought that by studying your response to situations 
there,*we would have a picture of 
wbat Pendleton's must have 
been." 

Templin didn't want to talk 
about it, Eckert realized, but it 
had to be explained to him. 

"Do you 'want to know why 
Pendleton killed himself?" 

Templin shrugged listlessly. 

"I suppose we should have seen 
it right away," Eckert continued. 
"Any race that is so happy with 
their way of life that they show 
no curiosity about strangers, the 
way they live, or what possessions 
they have, must have something 
to be happy about. Tunpesh is 
something that might happen 
only once in a thousand civiliza


tions, maybe less, Ray. 

"The environment is perfection 
and so are the people, or at least 
as near to perfection as it's possible to get. An intelligent people 
who have as much technology as 
they desire, living simply with 
themselves and each other. A fluke 
of nature, perhaps. No criminals, 
no insane, no neurotics. A perfect 
cultural pattern. Tunpesh is a 
paradise. You didn't want to 
leave, neither did I, and neither " 
did Pendleton." 

" Templin turned on him. "So it 
was paradise. Would it have been 
criminal if I had stayed there? 
Who would it have hurt?" 

"It would have hurt you," Eckert said gravely. "Because the 
Tunpeshans would never have accepted you. We're too different, 
Ray. We're too aggressive, too 
pushy, too persistent. We're not 
—perfect. You see, no matter how 
long we stayed there, we would 
never have fit in. We lived in a 
harsh society and we bear the 
scars of it. Our own environment 
has conditioned us, and we can't 
change. Oh, we could try, but it 
would crop up in little ways. Because of that, the natives could 
never genuinely like us. We'd 
never belong. Their own cultural 
pattern wouldn't allow them to 
accept us. 

"Their cultural pattern- is like 
the Fire and the Sword that were 
placed outside the Garden of 



150 




 



Eden, after Adam and Eve were 
driven out, to keep it sacrosanct. 
If you're an outsider, you stay 
outside. You can never come in." 

HE paused a moment, waiting 
for Templin to say something. Templin didn't. 

"The natives have a word for 
it. Kava. It means, I suppose, different — not necessarily inferior, 
just different. We should have 
seen it as time went on. We 
weren't invited places; they seemed to avoid us. A natural reaction 
for them, I guess I have to admit." 

Eckert cleared his throat huskily. "You see, what happened to 
Pendleton," he continued awkwardly, "is that he fell in love 
with paradise, but paradise would 
have nothing to do with him. By 
the time three years were up, he 
knew that he was an outcast in 
Eden. And he couldn't leave, to 
come back and try to forget. He 
was stranded in paradise and had 
to look forward to spending four 
more years there as a pariah. He 
couldn't do it. And neither could 
you." 

He was quiet for a moment, 
thinking of the cool, scented air 
and the warm sunshine and the 
happy kids playing on the grassy 
lanes. 

"I suppose it didn't affect you 
at all, did it?" Templin asked 
venomously. 



\ SHADOW crossed Eckerfa 
** l face. "You should know better than that, Ray. Do you think 
I'll ever forget it? Do you think 
I'll ever be satisfied with my own 
culture again?*' 

"What are you going to do 
about it?" 

"It's dangerous to human beings, Ray. Looking at it brutally, 
their culture has killed two of our 
people as surely as if Tunpesh 
were populated by murderous 
savages. We'll probably send a 
larger commission, throw it open 
to commerce, try to change it." 

Templin gripped the sides of 
the couch, his face strained and 
tense with anxiety. "What happens to it depends on the report 
you make, doesn't it?" 

"Yes, it does." 

"Then make up something in 
your report. Say the climate is 
bad for Earthmen. Say anything, 
but don't let them change Tunpesh !" 

Eckert looked at him for a long 
moment, remembering. 

"Okay, Ray," he said slowly. 
"We'll leave paradise alone. 
Strictly alone. It'll be put on the 
quarantine list." 

He turned and left. 

Behind him, Templin swiveled 
around in his chair and gazed 
bleakly at the tiny mote of yellow 
fading in the blackness of space.

a path for her delicate, tottering 
feet, she had struck matches 
down dark alleys, and found her 
way to Hindu mystics who floated their flickering, starry eyelashes over crystal balls. She had 
walked on the meadow paths with 
ascetic Indian philosophers imported by daughters-in-spirit of 
Madame Blavatsky. She had 
made pilgrimages to California's 
stucco jungles to hunt the astrological seer in his natural habitat. She had even consented to 
signing away the rights to one of 
her homes in order to be taken 
into the shouting order of a temple of amazing evangelists who 
had promised her golden smoke, 
crystal fire, and the great soft 
hand of God coming to bear her 
home. 

None of these people had ever 
shaken Mrs. Bellowes' faith, even 
when she saw them sirened away 
in a black wagon in the night, or 
discovered their pictures, bleak 
and unromantic, in the morning 
tabloids. The world had roughed 
them up and locked them away 
because they knew too much, that 
was all. 

And then, two weeks ago, she 
had seen Mr. Thirkell's advertisement in New York City: 

COME TO MARS! 

Stay at the Thirkell Restorium for one week. And 
then, on into space on the 



greatest adventure life can 
offer! 

Send for Free Pamphlet: 
"Nearer My God To Thee." 

Excursion rates. Round 
trip slightly lower. 

"Round trip," Mrs. Bellowes 
had thought. "But who would 
come back after seeing Him?" 

And so she had bought a ticket 
and flown off to Mars and spent 
seven mild days at Mr. Thirkell's 
Restorium, the building with the 
sign on it which flashed: thirkell's rocket to heaven! She 
had spent the week bathing in 
limpid waters and erasing the 
care from her tiny bones, and now 
she was fidgeting, ready to be 
loaded into Mr. Thirkell's own 
special private rocket, like a bullet, to be fired on out into space 
beyond Jupiter and Saturn and 
Pluto. And thus — who could deny 
it?— you would be getting nearer 
and nearer to the Lord. How 
wonderful! Couldn't you just feel 
Him drawing near? Couldn't you 
just sense His breath, His scrutiny. His Presence? 

"Here I am," said Mrs. Bellowes, "an ancient rickety elevator, ready to go up the shaft. God 
need only press the button." 

Now, on the seventh day, as 
she minced up the steps of the 
Restorium, a number of small 
doubts "assailed her. 

"For one thing," she said aloud 



A LITTLE JOURNEY 



153 



to no one, "it isn't quite^the land 
of milk and honey here on Mars 
that they said it would be. My 
room is like a cell, the swimming 
pool is really quite inadequate, 
and, besides, how many widows 
who look like mushrooms or skeletons want to swim? And, finally, 
the whole Restorium smells of 
boiled cabbage and tennis shoes!" 

She opened the front door and 
let it slam, somewhat irritably. 

She was amazed at the other 
women in the auditorium. It was 
like wandering in a carnival mirror-maze, coming again and 
again upon yourself — the same 
floury face, the same chicken 
hands, and jingling bracelets. One 
after another of the images of 
herself floated before her. She put 
out her hand, but it wasn't a mirror; it was another lady shaking 
her fingers and saying: 

"We're waiting for Mr. Thirkell. Sh!" 

"Ah," whispered everyone. 
The velvet curtains parted. 
Mr. Thirkell appeared, fantastically serene, his Egyptian eyes 
upon everyone. But there was 
something, nevertheless, in his 
appearance which made one expect him to call "Hi!" while fuzzy dogs jumped over his legs, 
through his hooped arms, and 
over his back. Then, dogs and 
aft, he should dance with a dazzling piano -key board smile off 
into the wings. 



Mrs. Bellowes, with a secret 
part of her mind which she constantly had to grip tightly, expected to hear a cheap Chinese 
gong sound when Mr. Thirkell 
entered. His large liquid dark 
eyes were so improbable that one 
of the old ladies had facetiously 
claimed she saw a mosquito cloud 
hovering over them as they did 
around summer rain-barrels. And 
Mrs. Bellowes sometimes caught 
the scent of the theatrical mothball and the smell of calliope 
steam on his sharply pressed suit. 

But with the same savage rationalization that had greeted all 
other disappointments in her rickety life, she bit at the suspicion 
and whispered, "This time it's 
real. This time it'll work. Haven't 
we got a rocket?" 

Mr. Thirkell bowed. He smiled 
a sudden Comedy Mask smile. 
The old ladies looked in at his 
epiglottis and sensed chaos there. 

Before he even began to speak, 
Mrs. Bellowes saw him picking up 
each of his words, oiling it, making sure it ran smooth on its rails. 
Her heart squeezed in like a tiny 
fist, and she gritted her porcelain 
teeth. 

"Friends," said Mr. Thirkell, 
and you could hear the frost snap 
in the hearts of the entire assemblage. 

"No!"' said Mrs. Bellowes 
ahead of time. She could hear 
the bad news rushing at her, and 



154 




 



herself tied to the track while 
the immense black wheels threatened and the whistle screamed, 
helpless. 

"There will be a slight delay." 
said Mr. Thirkell. 

In the next instant, Mr. Thirkell might have cried, or been 
tempted to cry, "Ladies, be seated!" in minstrel-fashion, for the 
ladies had come up at him from 
their chairs, protesting and trembling. 

"Not a very long delay." Mr. 
Thirkell put up his hands to pat 
the air. 

"How long?" 

"Only a week." 

"A week!" 

"Yes. You can stay here at the 
Restorium for seven more days, 
can't you? A little delay won't 
matter, will it, in the end? You've 
waited a lifetime. Only a few 
more days." 

At twenty dollars a day, 
thought Mrs. Bellowes, coldly. 

"What's the trouble?" a woman cried. 

"A legal difficulty, " said Mr. 
Thirkell. 

"We've a rocket, haven't we?" 

"Well, ye-ess." 

"But I've been here a whole 
month, waiting," said one old 
lady. "Delays, delays!" 

"That's right." said everyone. 

"Ladies, ladies," murmured 
Mr. Thirkell, smiling serenely. 

"We want to see the rocket!" 



It was Mrs. Bellowes forging 
ahead, alone, brandishing her fist 
like a toy hammer. 
' Mr. Thirkell looked into the 
old ladies' eyes, a missionary 
among albino cannibals. 

"Well, now." he said. 

"Yes, now!" cried Mrs. Bellowes. 

"I'm afraid — " he began. 

"So am I!" she said. "That's 
why we want to see the ship!" 

"No, no, now. Mrs. — " He 
snapped his fingers for her name. 

"Bellowes!" she cried. She was 
a small container, but now all the 
seething pressures that had been 
built up over long years came 
steaming through the delicate 
vents of her body. Her cheeks became incandescent. With a wail 
that was like a melancholy factory whistle, Mrs. Bellowes ran 
forward and hung to him, almost 
by her teeth, like a summermaddened Spitz. She would not 
and never could let go, until he 
died, and the other women followed, jumping and yapping 
like a pound let loose on its 
trainer, the same one who had 
petted them and to whom they 
had squirmed and whined joyfully an hour before, now milling; 
about him, creasing his sleeves 
and frightening the Egyptian serenity from his gaze. 

"This way!" cried Mrs. Bellowes, feeling like Madame Lafarge. "Through the back! We've 



A LITTLE JOURNEY 



155 



waited long enough to see the 
ship. Every day he's put us off, 
every day we've waited, now let's 
see." 

"No, no, ladies !" cried Mr. 
Thirkell, leaping about. 

They burst through the back 
of the stage and out a door, like 
a flood, bearing the poor man 
with them into a shed, and then 
out, quite suddenly, into an 
abandoned gymnasium. 

"There it is I" said someone. 
"The rocket." 

And then a silence fell that 
was terrible to entertain. 

There was the rocket. 

Mrs. Bellowes looked at it and 
her hands sagged away from Mr. 
Thirkell's collar. 

The rocket was something like 
a battered copper pot. There 
were a thousand bulges and rents 
and rusty pipes and dirty vents 
on and in it. The ports were 
clouded over with dust, resembling the eyes of a blind hog. 

Everyone wailed a little sighing wail. 

"Is that the rocket ship Glory 
Be to the Highest?" cried Mrs. 
Bellowes, appalled. 

Mr. Thirkell nodded and looked at his feet. 

"For which we paid out our 
one thousand dollars apiece and 
came all the way to Mars to get 
on board with you and go off to 
find Him?" asked Mrs. Bellowes. 
"Why, that isn't worth a sack 



of dried peas," said Mrs. Bellowes. 

"It's nothing but junk!" 

Junk, whispered everyone, getting hysterical. 

"Don't let him get away I" 

Mr. Thirkell tried to break and 
run, but a thousand possum traps 
closed on him from every side. He 
withered. 

Everybody walked around in 
circles like blind mice. There was 
a confusion and a weeping that 
lasted for five minutes as they 
went over and touched the 
Rocket, the Dented Kettle, the 
Rusty Container for God's Children. 

"Well," said Mrs. Bellowes. 
She stepped up into the askew 
doorway of the rocket and faced 
everyone. "It looks as if a terrible thing has been done to us,'* 
she said. "I haven't any money 
to go back home to Earth and 
I've too much pride to go to the 
Government and tell them a common man like this has fooled us 
out of our life's savings. I don't 
know how you feel about it, all 
of you, but the reason all of us 
came is because I'm eighty-five, 
and you're eighty-nine, and 
you're seventy -eight, and all of 
us are nudging on toward a hundred, and there's nothing on Earth 
for us, and it doesn't appear 
there's anything on Mars either. 
We all expected not to breathe 
much more air or crochet many 




 



more doilies or we'd never have 
come here. So what I have to 
propose is a simple thing — to 
take a chance." 

She reached out and touched 
the rusted hulk of the rocket. 

"This is our rocket. We paid 
for our trip. And we're going to 
take our trip!" 

Everyone rustled and stood on 
tiptoes and opened an astonished 
mouth. 

Mr. Thirkell began to cry. He 
did it quite easily and very effectively. 

"We're going to get in this 
ship," said Mrs. Bellowes, ignoring him. "And we're going to take 
off to where we were going." 

Mr. Thirkell stopped crying 
long enough to say, "But it was 
all a fake. I don't know anything about space. He's not out 
there, anyway. I lied. I don't 
know where He is, and I couldn't 
find Him if I wanted to. And you 
were fools to ever take my word 
on it." 

"Yes," said Mrs. Bellowes, "we 
were fools. I'll go along on that. 
But you can't blame us, for we're 
old, and it was a lovely, good and 
fine idea, one of the loveliest ideas 
in the world. Oh, we didn't really 
fool ourselves that we could get 
nearer to Him physically. It was 
the gentle, mad dream of old 
people, the kind of thing you hold 
onto for a few minutes a day, 
even though you know it's not 



ti-ue. So, all of you who want to 
go, you follow me in the ship." 

"But you can't go!" said Mr. 
Thirkell. "You haven't got a navigator. And that ship's a ruin!" 

"Yod," said Mrs. Bellowes, 
"will be the navigator." 

She stepped into the ship, and 
after a moment, the other old 
ladies pressed forward. Mr. Thirkell, windmilling his arms frantically, was nevertheless pressed 
through the port, and in a minute the door slammed shut. Mr. 
Thirkell was strapped into the 
navigator's seat, with everyone 
talking at once and holding him 
down. The special helmets were 
issued to foe fitted over every 
gray or white head- to supply extra oxygen in case of a leakage in 
the ship's hull, and at long last 
the hour had come and Mrs. Bellowes stood behind Mr. Thirkell 
and said, "We're ready, sir." 

He said nothing. He pleaded 
with ' them silently, using his 
great, dark, wet eyes, but Mrs. 
BeMowes shook her head and 
pointed to the control, 

"Takeoff," agreed Mr. Thirkell 
morosely, and pulled a switch. 

Everybody fell. The rocket 
went up from the planet Mars in 
a great fiery glide, with the noise 
of an entire kitchen thrown down 
an elevator shaft, with a sound 
of pots and pans and kettles and 
fires boiling and stews bubbling, 
with a smell of burned incense 



A LITTLE JOURNEY 



157 



and rubber and sulphur, with a 
color of yellow fire, and a ribbon 
of red stretching below them, and 
all the old women singing and 
holding to each other, and Mrs. 
Bellowes crawling upright in the 
sighing, straining, trembling ship, 
"Head for space, Mr. Thirkell." 

"It can't last," said Mr. Thirkell, sadly. "This ship can't last. 
It will—" 

It did. 

The rocket exploded. 

Mrs. Bellowes felt herself lifted and thrown about dizzily, like 
a doll. She heard the great 
screamings and saw the flashes 
of bodies sailing by her in fragments of metal and powdery 
light. 

"Help, help!" cried Mr. Thirkell, far away, on a small radio 
beam. 

v The ship disintegrated into a 
million parts, and the old ladies, 
all one hundred of them, were 
flung straight on ahead with the 
same velocity as the ship. 

As for Mr. Thirkell, for some 
reason of trajectory, perhaps, he 
had been blown out the other 
side of the ship. Mrs. Bellowes 
saw him falling separate and 
away from them, screaming, 
screaming. 

There goes Mr. Thirkell, 
thought Mrs. Bellowes. 

And she knew where he was 
going. He was going to be burned 



and roasted and broiled good, 
but very good. 

Mr. Thirkell was falling down 
into the Sun, 

And here we are, thought Mrs. 
Bellowes. Here we are, going on 
out, and out, and out. 

There was hardly a sense of 
motion at all, but she knew that 
she was traveling at fifty thousand miles an hour and would 
continue to travel at that speed ■ 
for an eternity, until ... 

She saw the other women 
swinging all about her in their 
own trajectories, a few minutes of 
oxygen left to each of them in 
their helmets, and each was looking up to where they were going. 

Of course, thought Mrs. Bellowes. Our info space. Out and 
out, and the darkness like a great 
church, and the stars like candles, 
and in spite of everything, Mr. 
Thirkell, the rocket, and the dishonesty, we are going toward the 
Lord. 

And there, yes, there, as she 
fell on and on, coming toward 
her, she could almost discern the 
outline now, coming toward her 
was His mighty golden hand, 
reaching down to hold her and 
comfort her like a frightened 
sparrow . . . 

"I'm Mrs. Amelia Bellowes," 
she said quietly, in her best company voice. "I'm from the planet 
Earth."

they do not, let me add this: 

Guin, like all writers worth 
reading, has served a long, discouragingly hard literary apprenticeship. Only a sublime egotist 
would expect to plead a criminal 
case, perform cardiac surgery, 
build a bridge, or repair shoes 
without training, yet almost 
everybody, for some reason, seems 
to think writing, psychiatry and 
painting require no special knowledge, furthermore, this version 
of Beyond Bedlam is the result 



of two drafts before submission, 
and two end-to-end rewrites 
afterward! A total of better than 
80,000 words was thus needed to 
produce 20,000 words that satisfied Guin's literary conscience 
and mine. 

If Beyond Bedlam is not a good 
story, it isn't because author and 
editor did not sweat bullets to 
make it so. 

That's primarily why GALAXY and its writers are opening 
new paths in science fiction.

The Current 
 Novel.. 



THE ALIEN 

by 

Raymond F. Jones 



Just speculate for a moment on the enormous 
challenge to archeology when interplanetary 
flight is possible . . . and relics are found of a 
race extinct for half a million years! A race, incidentally, that was scientifically so far in advance of ours that they held the secret of the 
restoration of life! 

One member of that race can be brought back 
after 500,000 years of death . . . 

That's the story told by this ORIGINAL booklength novel, which has never before been published! You can expect a muscle-tightening, 
sweat-producing, mind-prodding adventure in 
the future when you read it!
