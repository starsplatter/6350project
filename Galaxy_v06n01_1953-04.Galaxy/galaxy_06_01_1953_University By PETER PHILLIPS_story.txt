University By PETER PHILLIPS 

Put six small drunken ants in 
a twenty-gallon oil drum and 
heave it into space somewhere 
between Earth and Mars — 

I SCRUBBED the tape and 
started over again. The 
space concept wasn't to 
scale, anyway. Six bacteria in a 
seed-spore might be nearer the 
mark. I had to convey space, 



time and place in a fashion that 
the lay public could grasp when 
and if we boomeranged home. 

It was difficult — impossible, 
perhaps — and not made easier by 
the noise. M'Bassi had improvised a bongo drum from an 
upturned wastebasket and Brocuzynski was trying to scramble 
onto the desk to do a step-dance. 

Yet I didn't wish to seek silence in my cabin. The ship was 
too vast, the company too small. 
Being alone made you feel that 
the alien dark might creep in behind you, reach out with tentacular ringers — 

I wanted to join Lao in his 
old game of "show-fingers-guesssum-guess-wrong-drink another" 
which can be conveyed in precisely two Chinese characters and

is perhaps the most ancient of all 
drinking games. 

But I stayed at the transcriber 
trying to think back, getting 
memories lined up to explain just 
why, in this instant of mankind's 
greatest adventure, it was necessary for these pioneers to be as 
soaked i«i alcohol as a sextet of 
brandied peaches. 

Necessary? Of course. Sam 
had given the instructions and 
impressioning long ago — 

That phrase seeped up from 
my subconscious. It seemed to 
mean something, but when I tried 
to pin it down for analysis, its 
sense-structure disappeared like 
a pellet of frozen C0 2 in a hot 
hand. It left me with a feeling of 
estrangement from the others, the 
seventh ant in the oil drum — the 
odd ant out. 

That's how I'd felt earlier when 
these six had been at each others' 
throats instead of around each 
others' necks. 

Six babies. Six damned, squalling selfish babies. Six bouncing, 
babbling, but far from bonny 
babies. 

Five months ago, on Mars, they 
had been responsible, well-integrated men, the pick of the nations, esteemed beyond the 
borders of their own countries. 

The trouble started a "month" 
after the Boomerang's strange 



drive Jiad reduced a whole hemisphere of that dead planet to 
glassy aridity and flicked us out 
of the Solar System. 

TT'IRST blowup came between 
-■- Aventos and Brodcuzynski. 
Chessmen were scattered over the 
messroom floor. When I told 
them to quit behaving like kids, 
Aventos turned his sneer on me. 

"Listen to All-Nations Boy! 
Get back to your diary, sonny. 
Sold it in advance, haven't you? 
The only one who's making 
money out of this crazy trip. 
That is, if we ever do return." 

I went back to my desk. I 
tried never to argue, only to 
pacify. It became increasingly 
difficult to sting any of them into 
the realization that they were 
mature men of science, not fretful schoolkids on a too-long picnic jaunt. 

We couldn't stay alone in our 
cabins and we couldn't stay together in the messroom. That's 
what it came to. 

And we couldn't wander alone 
in the empty, echoing gangways 
and corridors of the mile-long 
ship. That was the quickest way 
to go psychptic. 

Borg sparked the next eruption. The mystery outside had 
touched some vein of poetry in 
his Scandinavian soul. He stood 
by the vision screen one "day" 
and started quoting aloud. Very

loud — clear and ringing. 

It may have been his own 
stuff or a translation of one of 
the Sagas: 

"The sea-devils thunder and mock 
our ears 

With cries of women and blinded 
children; 

But we must keep our eyes on the 
prow 

Where stands Erik the Hairless One 
Defying the sea-mountains. 
Our lips are sealed with ice — " 

Braithewaite let out a howl 
like a factory hooter: "Shut up 
you damned Dane! I'm trying 
to read!" 

"Then go to your cabin. You 
don't appreciate good poetry, 
you clod of a Yorkshireman." 

I managed to grab Braithewaite before he made a suicidal 
rush at the Borg, who was big 
and strong enough to club him to 
death with a single fist. 

M'Bassi managed to keep out 
of quarrels, but his genial face 
turned to immobile ebony and 
reduced his normally fluent conversation to the grunted basics 
of his original tongue. And disdain and cold withdrawal crept 
into the eyes of Lao T'Sun. 

Me? All-Nations Boy, they 
called me, in good-humor at first, 
then mockingly and with raw resentment. They were all degreed 
men. I was a mere publicist, appointed official chronicler by fortuitous virtue of thoroughly 



mixed racial descent, abrogation 
of all nationality allegiances and 
world-citizen status. 

When instability affected these 
most stable of men, I became 
unofficial arbiter. Not a leader. 
There could be no leaders on this 
trip. 

THE ship was semi-automatic, 
crewless, photonically set to 
snap into normal space within 
planetary observation distance of 
a sun, and then return. 

A captain, despite all possible 
screening, might be partisan. He 
might attempt to land if a suitable planet were seen and claim it 
— and the Boomerang — for his 
own nation, with accidents arranged for those of the crew who 
protested. 

So there was no crew. 
The Boomerang couldn't have 
been built by any single nation. 
It taxed the resources of the entire Earth. And the federal Earth 
government had made sure it 
would return as a federal ship — 
if it returned. 

The luminous dust that now 
ringed the Earth to mark the 
orbit of the vanished Moon was 
a reminder that no single nation 
could ever again be allowed to 
make an extraterrestrial conquest. 

Federal government, imposed 
and maintained by mutual fear 
of a war that might reduce Earth 
itself to the same dust, hadn't

diminished nationalistic rivalries 
in all spheres. Healthy economic 
and cultural competition remained, but under extremely 
tight control. 

Now, if never before, I could 
see why. We're still children. 
Proof enough of that in the 
squabbles after the Boomerang 
had been built, when the "proportional representation" howl 
went up. It was howled down, and 
the decision was made that basic 
racial groupings and not states 
should be represented, on a geopolitical basis. 

Yet these six under the strain 
of flight had become a microcosm 
, of the still-divided world. 

But they were powerless to do 
more than quarrel. We were still 
under the aegis of the government which set and sealed us 
aboard this fabulous craft to go, 
observe, return and report. Our 
destiny was still in the hands of 
men back in the Solar System, 
as surely as though those hands 
were propelling us. 

Perhaps it was that knowledge 
of complete helplessness that was 
partly responsible for the psychological crackup. These men 
were theoreticians. None could 
assume control of the vessel. Only 
two — Aventos and Lao — had a 
full mathematical grasp of the 
space -strain theory on which the 
propulsion unit was based. But 
neither would know what to do 



with a spanner if you put one in 
theii hands. 

Except crack each other over 
the head with it. 

That's what nearly happened. 
Middle-aged men might taunt, 
decry, jibe, revert to childishness 
in these circumstances, but I figured their whole conditioning 
would prevent actual personal 
violence. 

Then I had to hold Braithewaite back. And not long after 
that episode, Lao T'Sung, oldest 
and wisest among us, staggered 
against my desk and slumped 
near my feet. 

Brodcuzynski looked at his 
grazed knuckles. "I must be insane," he muttered. He seemed 
even more shocked than Lao, who 
sat up and rubbed a bruised chin. 

For a moment, I thought the 
cosmologist would burst into 
tears of remorse. Instead, he 
helped the sixty-year-old mathematician to his feet. 

"T'Sung, I could cut off my 
fist," he said awkwardly. "Something snapped in my head. How 
can I apologize — " "* 

Lao T'Sung took both hands 
of the man who'd just struck him 
and said: "I'm more surprised 
than hurt. Better to forgive yourself, Brod, than need my forgiveness." 

And Brodcuzynski snatched his 
wrists away and shouted: "For 
God's sake, " don't be magnani

mous! Let me be sorry my own 
way!" 

1GOT up from my desk. "It 
was a lousy trick, Brod." 
"Don't I know it? Here, take 
a smack." He jutted out his unshaven chin. "Go on, take a poke 
at me. But don't preach!" 

Lao made graceful, deprecatory motions with his slender yellowy hands. 

"Lao, you've said I had wisdom 
beyond my years. Isn't it time we 
applied everybody's wisdom to 
the present problem?" 

Lao looked at me. "I refer that 
to the man who's just demonstrated that problem. What's 
your opinion, Brod?" 

Brodcuzynski worriedly passed 
the buck to M'Bassi. "You're the 
psychologist. Why did I knock 
Lao down? What's got into us?" 

M'Bassi was determinedly engaging himself with a stereostrip 
projection of the World Games. 
He lifted his eyebrows. 
"You heard," I said. 
"Just ignoring what I can't 
control." He unrolled his lanky 
black length from a sit-easy. He 
was wearing only a pair of linen 
shorts. "I could happily knock 
all your silly heads together — 
knowing that my own head needs 
an equally powerful jolt. My 
neural paths are cross^circuiting 
into a neurosis cycle. We're affected by something beyond our 



immediate understanding. Something beyond human experience. 
Out there." 

He nodded toward the dull jet 
of the vision screen. It was lifeless except for the blue -white 
patch of the Galaxy we were both 
leaving and approaching — and 
existing in. 

"Within our own solar system, 
our minds are safe. The distances : 
and speeds involved in transit 
are directly comprehensible. But 
our present velocity and mode of 
propulsion are beyond either direct or intuitive conception. * 

"In effect, we're in an alien 
universe. But our minds, trained \^ 
to perceive and correlate, are instinctively trying to grasp the 
unknowable. That way, conflict 
is sown in the unconscious." 

"But men have made such 
journeys in the imagination," Lao 
protested, "and the imagination 
is a function of the higher centers. Our friend Statlen — " he 
waved at me — "has a drawerful 
of photostats of ancient magazines in which the concept of 
interstellar travel is taken for 
granted." 

M'Bassi tried to smile. 

Once, Sam had a similar 
strained smile on his face, before 
he gave me the impressioning. 
The whole project was h'gliegn — 
fun, playing with kids — but I 
must forget that and behave like 



UNIVERSITY 



69 



a child . . . Who was Sam? A 
fleeting mental picture, halfdream — 

"Imagination," M'Bassi said, 
"can withdraw from the extrapolation of its own functioning. But 
our minds are experiencing the 
unknowable. We can't withdraw. 
Our destiny isn't in our own 
hands. And there lies another 
conflict. Part of our minds is back 
home, grasping the familiar referents. . The other part is here." 

M'Bassi was sitting on the 
ledge in front of the vision screen. 
Brodcuzynski sat up there beside 
him, blocking the incredible 
scene. 

"The end result?" Brod asked. 

"Increasing xenophobia," M'Bassi said. "The unconscious is 
fighting to retain its integrity 
against the impossible demands 
of the higher centers." He took a 
cigarette from the pocket of his 
shorts. "Neurosis begins. Finally, 
unless the conflict is sublimated 
or resolved — " 

He held up the cigarette, tensed 
his fingers. We watched the flimsy 
thing intently. It broke under the 
strain. He tossed the halves to the 
messroom floor. 

T AO, after the silence, asked: 
"Why isn't Statlen affected 
to the same extent as the rest of 

us?" 

"Young, resilient mind. And 



with all respect to our youthful 
friend, it's because his brain isn't 
highly trained in scientific method. The more you know, the more 
you know you don't know." 

I said: "Thanks. Are you suggesting they should have sent a 
bunch of morons? Anyway, how 
about Borg? He may act a little 
crazy, but he hasn't shown any 
homicidal tendencies. Let him 
alone and he'll spout poetry all 
day quite happily." 

"It's hard to believe you're all 
such innocents or so unobservant." M'Bassi grinned fleetingly. 
"Have you smelled Borg's 
breath? He carries it well, but 
he's been drunk for days. He's 
stultified his higher centers with 
alcohol." 

Borg Was gently snoring in a 
chair. 

"Why hasn't he mentioned it, 
shared it around?" 

M'Bassi shrugged. "We've 
hardly been on companionable 
terms lately. He may be ashamed 
of his secret tippling. And he may 
not have much of a hoard." 

"Would it work?" 

"Eventually it would have the 
same depressant effect as a barbiturate." 

Aventos said: "I disagree. Depends on the individual." 

"Wake Borg," I said. "I'd 
rather ride with a bunch of 
drunks than a homicidal gang of 
schizophrenics."

GALAXY SCIENCE -FICTION 



Lao was startled. "My dear 
Statlen, have some respect for 
your elders. Do you propose to 
feed us alcohol as you'd feed a 
baby soothing syrup?" 

M'Bassi waved an expressive 
pink-palmed hand at the group. 
"Babies," he said. "I prescribe it. 
We must try something, and do 
it soon. The only alternative is 
narcotics from the first-aid, in 
large doses. If there's enough to 
go around, we'd become raging 
addicts." 

."We don't know if there's 
enough alcohol," Braithewaite 
pointed out. "Borg couldn't have 
secreted much." 

I shook Borg's shoulders 
roughly. His head lolled over and 
he opened red-veined eyes. 

"Where is it? Where do. you 
keep your liquor?" 

He smiled feebly. "Wouldn't, 
you like to know, son? Go away." 

"How much have you got 
cached? We feel like a drink 
ourselves." 

He sat up and looked around 
Wearily. "That's different. I figured you were all blue noses because I was the only one who 
brought any aboard.' I finished 
that way back, but I got plenty 
more. Plenty. More'n you could 
drink in a year of pub-crawling." 

Of course there was plenty. 
That was arranged by Sam long 
ago. No mass expedition, no 



moronic minds, but a few of the 
best — with their higher centers 
temporarily dulled. 

BORG weaved out of the door 
with drunken benevolent gestures to us to follow. 

I had the crazy idea he might 
be distilling it. That was just 
possible, using ration fruit bars. 
Where? Practically any place 
away from our quarters. We 
weren't cramped for space. The 
Boomerang was a rabbit-warren. 
It wouldn't have been overmanned with a crew of a few 
hundred, and there were only 
seven of us. 

The machinery installed to replace crew — rob-mechs of fantastic omniscience, competence 
and cost — occupied only fractional space. A full-scale distillery could have been set up 
somewhere in the miles of convoluted steel guts of the ship. 

She'd been started as a 
generation -to -generation vessel. 
An entire self-contained colonizing community was to have 
boarded her, with the hope that 
their great - great - great - grandchildren would get to some star 
on straight atomic drive. 

That might have been better. 
Time and a common, recognized 
destiny would have welded them 
into racial and political homogeneity. But when the new drive 
was discovered, it was cheaper to 



UNIVERSITY 



71 



install it in this vast, near-empty 
hull than build another. The 
drive disregarded mass, could 
move or "translate" a mountain 
as easily as a molehill. 

Still, the Boomerang could be 
carrying hundreds instead of a 
mere seven political and scientific 
guinea pigs. 

Six guinea pigs — and yourself, 
Statlen, said a timeless whisper. 

I stumbled on M'Bassi's heels 
as we filed into yet another 
empty, echoing corridor. He halfturned with a forgiving grin. 

"This calls for fullest exercise 
of your descriptive powers, Statlen. Here we are, seven mature 
representatives of a race that's 
reaching out for the Universe, and 
we're running away from our own 
presumption. Running away from 
the stars — in search of a drink." 

Aventos, just behind me, said 
quietly and without blasphemy: 
". . . and on the sixth day, God 
took time off from Creation to 
slip into the nearest saloon for a 
shot of rye." 

Lao T'Sung said: "You think 
we're playing at being God?" 

"We're playing at being men. 
At the moment we all want to 
go home to Mother. We think 
we're grown up, making our way 
in the world. But we're still tied 
to her apron strings." 

M'Bassi's voice boomed back 



in the corridor. "Mother Earth, 
eh? A startlingly fresh application of the ancient Jungian psychology." 

Borg stopped in front of a redpainted sliding door, fumbled 
with a complicated catch. "Open 
Sesame !" 

Cans were stacked in clamped 
piles inside. 

"The Boomerang," said Borg, 
"is a complete ship. The emergency chemical jets may never 
have to be used. If they are, 
there's sufficient for five minute's 
blasting in the tanks. And if that's 
not enough, here's a reserve." 

Brodcuzynski looked at the 
symbols on the cans and uttered 
a few wondering cusswords. 
"Look what that Dane's been 
drinking! Don't anyone give Borg 
a cigarette or he'll jet off clean 
out of his boots." 

"Not neat, of course," Borg 
agreed. "Recipe is one-third absolute, one-third water, one-third 
fruit juice. No fusel oils or other 
rotgut products after distillation. 
Just plain, pure ethyl alcohol. It 
makes terrific cocktails. I've tried 
it with lemon, bay leaves, tomato 
ketchup, aniseed and milk so far. 
It curdles the milk. But let's 
experiment." 

HPHAT had been four hours 
ago, ship time. 
The pickling process with men 
obviously unused to alcohol had 



72 




 



been rapid. And they weren't in 
prime physical condition, though 
you wouldn't guess it, looking at 
the exertions of Brodcuzynski 
and M'Bassi. 

Their reactions were slowed, 
high centers dulled. 

Nicely timed. In about an hour 
according to the clock in my mind 
— the only possible measurement 
in this case — they would be in 
the passive stage, quietly happy 
or maybe maudlin, according to 
temperament. And receptive. 

f deceptive to what? 

M'Bassi quit his thumping, 
came over to my desk and grabbed the edge to steady himself. 
"You don' look too good, son. 
What's troublin' you?" 

"Wish I knew," I said, and 
meant it. I rubbed the back of my 
head. "There's something ticking 
away here, and the ticks are getting closer together." 

He laughed. "Sonarscope, maybe. Or that's an egg and you've 
got something hatching inside 
there waitin' to bust out. Don't 
worry, boy. Have some more 
snake-milk." 

I shot the drink down with a 
grimace. But the ticking went on, 
irritating, irregular, quickening, 
like a geiger counter approaching 
a radioactive source. 

Within the hour it had become 
a continuous susurration. 



A few seconds after the alarm 
signal vibrated through the messroom, it stopped abruptly. 

The observation screen flared 
white and blank, pseudo- gravity 
ceased with the cutting of the 
drive-field, and the simple instruments rimming the screen showed 
the impossible: zero readings all 
around. 
The Boomerang was at rest. 

I saw the necessity for the 
relaxing .alcohol now. 

Two billion tons of metal being 
translated at more-than-light velocity can't come to a dead stop. 

But it had. 

And alcohol cushioned the 
mind against that fact. And 
against other things. 

"Pink elephants!" Aventos 
breathed. He turned a slow cartwheel in front of the screen and 
solemnly regarded the dials upside down. "I don't believe it." 

Braithewaite pointed to the 
thing that was growing slowly in 
the middle of the messroom. 
"Thass not pink," he said carefully, "and it's not an ephelant." 

Sam stabilized himself at half 
his full size and looked around. 
He saw me and smiled. 

"Having fun?" he asked vocally in English. 

I'd waited four thousand years 
for that trigger. Now I remembered. 

"Nice body," Sam approved. 
"Can you still semblize?"

"Give me time," I said. "It's 
been quite a while." 

"We'll shift the whole heap 
down to the — what's the word?" 

"Campus," I supplied. 

" — campus, and give these 
good gentlemen a little gravity 
before they lose their last meal." 

A T the farther end of the Hall, 
the statue of Athena hadn't 
changed since I last saw it. The 
Eternal Light still burned as 
brightly from the alabaster of 
that vast, high forehead. Not surprising, considering it had a halflife of two million years. 

I gave her a perfunctory nod 
and half a wink. We revere wisdom, not its symbols. But she 
impresses the customers. 

Sam, to me, direct: No Greek? 

English universal tongue now. 

Barbaric. 

You get it? 

In clear. Help out with odd 
term. 

Vocally, to the six: "Gentlemen, as — " 
President. 

" — president of this establishment, I welcome you and trust 
that your stay will be pleasant. 
Mr. Statlen will continue to act 
as your mentor and guide and I 
shall be available at any time if 
you wish for any .further information and — " 

Enlightenment. 

Filthy concatenation of sylla


bles, that. Don't like." 

" — enlightenment." 

"If this be Valhalla, I recogize no gods," muttered Borg suddenly. I thought it was a misplaced sense of the dramatic until 
I realized he was quoting. He 
strode forward and poked at 
Sam's shoulder. 

"I'm all here," Sam said politely. 

"That's more than I am, mister." 

"And my name isn't — " 
Bearded mythological gatekeeper? 
St. Peter. 

"—isn't St. Peter. I realize you 
must be upset and confused by 
the suddenness of this arisement, 
but we find it psychologically 
unwise to allow reason to intervene by doing things more gradually." 

"Upset?" Braithewaite laughed 
shortly. "That's the ultimate understatement." 

IT^HEY were sobering up fast, 
but alcohol still put a protective haze over their higher 
faculties. 

"If it's real," M'Bassi said, 
"I'm due for a galaxy-size hangover." 

"Where are we?" asked Lao 
bluntly. Drinking rice wine in his 
youth had given him a hard and 
intensely practical head. 

"A planet," Sam replied. 



74 




 



"Impossible. Our retranslation 
into the normal continuum could 
not have taken place so near 
planetary mass." 

"So near? You were a lightmonth distant when our field encompassed you." 

"Stopped us and brought us 
here within ten minutes?" 

"An arbitrary measure of 
time." 

"What system is this?" 

"One far removed from your 
own." 

"Our range was five light-years. 
Centaurus — " 

"Your range was far greater 
than you were permitted to imagine. Even had it been less, you 
would have been broiight within 
the aegis of- this establishment. 
And now, gentlemen, please allow 
Mr. Statlen to conduct you to 
your quarters. Time for questions 
and work after you've rested." 

CAM abruptly semblized him^ self elsewhere and left me to 
face the growing storm. 

I'm afraid Aventos was the 
first to display terrestrial chauvenism and a lamentable lack of 
intellectual discipline. 

"I suppose you can vanish like 
that, you bloody spy?" 

I laughed at the use of the 
term. "I've nearly forgotten, but 
I'll be getting into practice again. 
The word 'spy' implies conflict. 
There's no conflict here. You're 



safe and you'll be made comfortable." 

Brodcuzynski spoke for the 
first time. Despite his silvered 
hair, he was the youngest in 
heart. He was still happy-drunk. 
He had wandered away to study 
the decorated wall panels. He'd 
even spoken to a student scurrying through the Hall to look at 
the Boomerang. She smiled, 
psyched him quickly, gave his 
head a benedictory pat, and hurried on to join her quietly amused 
colleagues in the doorway. None 
of them had paused to look at our 
group. 

Brod rejoined us. "Nice place," 
he said. "Coeducational, too. Umum. Don't tell my wife." 

Thank Athena for Brod at that 
moment. 

The temporary easing of suspicion gave me time to usher 
them to their adjoining rooms. 

"Take a nap, freshen up, then 
we'll eat," I said. 

Aventos sat on the edge of his 
couch. His normally olive face 
was pale. "Where is it?" 

"Out along the corridor to the 
left. Marked with an unmistakable symbol." 

"We're not prisoners?" 

"Go where you like, Juan. But 
I'd advise you to rest." 

He put his head in his hands 
and looked sick and miserable. 

When I reported to Sam later, 
he was giving instructions for 



UNIVERSITY 



75 



the Boomerang to be parked elsewhere. 

Direct: "Litters up the place. 
What a ship! A power hammer 
to crack a nut. Initially a colonizer?" 

"Yes." 

"You did well, Stat." 

"No thanks to me. Does conditioning take everything into 
account, every conceivable deviation?" 

"No. You automatically apply 
correction." 



"Interference?" 

"Of course not. Unconscious 
participation to a worthy end. 
Do you recall no example?" 

I thought back. "A statesmanthinker, Francis Bacon . . . Yes, 
I started trend." 

"Completed?" 

"No. Still mind-matter bifurcation." 

Sam: "Obvious, from that ungainly hulk of metal. Will they 
get through?" 

Doubt. Hope. "I like them." 



76 




 



Sam, amusement: "They don't 
like you. They'll like you less 
afterward. Tough job." 

Myself, deprecation concept : 
"Would be, if I were conscious of 
performing it." 

"Return if necessary?" 

"Certainly. Was writing imaginative fiction. Helps a little, I 
believe." 

r¥"iHE six were observed during 
their unrestrained wanderings. 
I took part and scanned them 



myself during one particular 
sleep-period, the greater part of 
which they spent in Lao T'Sung's 
room, framing questions. Aventos 
called it a "council of war." 

On the following day-start, I 
took them to Assembly in the 
Hall. Despite exercise therapy, 
they still showed signs of mental 
wear and physical dissipation. 
But Brodcuzynski was still irrepressible. 

He looked at a group of students from Mizra III, tall,, uni

formly blonde, in purple gowns. 
"Magnificent!" 

M'Bassi surprise4 me. "Don't 
fool yourself, Brod. They probably regard you as a mentally 
retarded savage from a cesspool 
planet." 

"That came hard, didn't it, 
M'Bassi?" I asked quietly. 

"It's obvious. The only possible 
conclusion to fit the facts. The 
others don't agree, but — " He 
shrugged his massive black 
shoulders. "My branch of the 
race suffered imposed inferiority 
for so long that my ego isn't outraged by the assumption, unlike 
Juan Aventos and Lao T'Sung, 
who seem to be taking the dignity 
of the entire race on their shoulders." 

True dignity can never be pathetic, even when it lacks substance for its assertion. 

But I smiled within when Lao 
marched up to the rostrum beneath the representation of 
Athena and raised his voice to 
Sam: "Let's stop this farce! Why 
are we here? Where is this place? 
What is the purpose of this gathering? If this is some form of 
religious ceremony — " 

A vocal buzz of surprise arose 
from the students as they put out 
psych-prongs to Lao and grasped 
— or failed to gra,sp — his meaning. 

Even though he knew it was 
coming, Sam was a little embar


i 

rassed. There had been few such 
interruptions during the million 
years of his presidency. £ 
"I regretful — " Sam began. ijj 
Word, quickly. That's incorrect. 

Just say you're sorry. 

"I'm sorry you should chose ^ 
this moment to question me, Mr. 1 
Lao. I have told you that you .'ithave access to me at any time. |s 
And this is not religion. I can f 
see your concept dimly. You are ,<fi 
not—" 

Sam fumbled impatiently in 
my mind. Abrogating, I told him. 
It's a soothing vocalization. $f 

" — abrogating one whit of your '|j 
particular individual or racial su- § 
perstition — " 

Attention, Sam. That's wrong. 
Use belief. 

" — beliefs by attending this little ceremony. We are merely dedicating the new day to a chase of 
knowing." 

Sam plucked the words from 
me before I could indicate correct usage, and tried metaphor in 
an unknown tongue — a very 
chancy business. 

Pursuit of wisdom. 

Doesn't matter. He gets the 
idea. 

Lao did. He returned to our 
group, sat in hard-faced silence 
until the brief business was finished, students had dispersed and 
seats which were not being used 
had sunk again into the floor.

When Sam came up to us, grayhaired old Braithewaite chuckled 
at a sudden recollection. 

"In walk and general demeanor," he said, "you might be the 
twin brother of my tutor at Oxford." 

A classical university. 

Sam grinned back. "I take that 
as a compliment. You were a student of Greek?" 

"A poor one." 

"But you recognize our emblem?" 

"I've seen similar representations of Athena, allegoricized as a 
symbol of wisdom.' 

f f A WHIM on the part of our 
first expedition. They 
brought her back some four thousand of your years ago. She replaced an earlier symbol from 
another solar system, and has remained our favorite since, although we have a choice of five 
hundred or more similar symbols 
from the mythologies of other 
planets. Our second expedition 
placed Mr. Statlen among you." 

"Are we to believe he's as old 
as that?" Aventos demanded, 
looking at me with bleak-eyed 
suspicion. 

Reply, Stat. 

"In effect, considerably older," 
I said. "But until yesterday, I 
had no memories beyond those 
of the thirty-odd years I've spent 
in this particular body; and I 



\ 

didn't know that I was anything 
other than what I seemed." 

"The essence of what is loosely 
called mind or ego was, in Mr. 
Statlen's case, rendered transferable," Sam explained. "The 
faculty was unconscious, together 
with memories of its endowment and its eventual purposes. 
The awareness of an observer 
becomes a factor in his observations, so awareness was 
suppressed. 

"When intervention of a kind 
at last became necessary, Mr. 
Statlen became- the unconscious 
transmitter of certain impulses 
which subtly influenced the 
course of events. 

"A devious method of achieving our ends, but a more direct \ 
means would defeat our purpose." 

"And what is that purpose?" 
Aventos asked. 

"To ascertain without its 
knowledge whether a race has 
achieved a degree of civilization 
commensurate with its material 
and scientific advancement. Civilization lies in the hearts and 
minds of men, not in their works. 
You've developed interstellar 
travel, but are you fit to use it? 
Are you fit to — graduate?" 

M'Bassi widened his broad 
nostrils. "If Statlen's the bossboy and he's been around so long, 
why not ask him?" 

"Neither Mr. Statlen nor his

innumerable colleagues are able 
to communicate with us, or we 
with them. That would negate 
the non-intervention principle. 
Their sole task — mainly unconscious — is to insure that suitable 
representatives of an aspiring 
race are brought here for examination when they develop an interstellar drive." 

"And suppose they don't make 
the grade?" 

"What happens under your 
own curiously varied education 
system if a student fails an entrance examination? We can't 
press the analogy too close, but 
doesn't he return to junior or 
public or elementary school?" 

Aventos stepped closer. "Quit 
dodging. You say all this is done 
without the knowledge of the 
race. But we've been brought 
here. So we know. So what happens to us and our ship?" 

Aventos' death-fear was almost 
a physical pain in Sam's mind 
and mine. 

CAM gave him a quick soothe ^ probe. "You are sent back," 
he said gently. "Your memories 
of this period are erased and replaced by the conviction that 
your expedition has failed, that 
your ship did not emerge at all 
from its probability state into the 
normal continuum. 

"You will have been nowhere, 
seen nothing. Your drive will be 



altered to put you on a false and 
infinitely complex mathematical 
trail. This, and the vast cost of 
experimentation, together with 
subtly hindering influences unconsciously transmitted by the 
mentor delegated to your planet, 
will guarantee that no further 
major attempts are made for several centuries." 

Sam was becoming positively 
pedantic in his use of this new 
language. 

Direct: more to this tongue 
than I suspected. Good flowing 
periods possible. 

Borg, who'd been standing 
quietly enough, fingering his fair 
beard and gazing at Athena, said 
suddenly in his deep bull voice: 
"By what right do you arrogate 
these powers to yourselves, whatever you may be?" 

"The simple right of exclusion, 
which has no moral, ethical or 
legal basis, but is applied as a 
matter of common sense. Statlen 
informs me you are a professor of 
comparative philology at Harvard University. 

"Suppose a five-year-old child 
from a village school demanded 
the right to enter your classes, 
sit in on your lectures, avail himself of your library. You wouldn't 
even question whether he'd benefit. You'd take him firmly by the 
ear, lead him outside, tell him 
to come back when he'd gone 
through the grades and high 



80 




 



school and college, or however 
you term the progressive units in 
your educational system. 

"Even if he protested that, despite his behavior in fighting 
other kids and breaking your 
windows with his slingshot, he 
was really quite grown up and a 
hidden genius and fascinated by 
comparative philology, would you 
take his word for it?" 

"A fantastic and degrading analogy," Lao said coldly. "You 
can't equate a race with an individual in such an incredibly 
cavalier manner." 

"But we can and do," said 
Sam. 

HE had endowed himself with 
the physiognomy of an ancient 
Roman emperor for the benefit 
of the six. He rubbed the highbridged nose as he spoke. "By our 
standards, you are a young race. 
You may have advanced sufficiently to be permitted at least 
to study here. That is what we 
must ascertain. 

"As I indicated, the empathy 
index weighs more heavily with 
us than the intelligence quotient. 
I understand that your mental 
and physical sciences are still 
largely divided. That doesn't 
promise well for you. 

"Until a race achieves a synthesis, an integrated system recognizing the indivisibility of 
mind-matter concepts, its natural 



chauvinism cannot be sublimated. 
It remains the child of conflict. 

"That attitude is useful, even 
necessary, in the infancy of the 
race, when survival is the only 
criterion. But if the race carries 
that attitude into maturity, it becomes dangerous to itself — and, 
unfortunately, to others, because 
its intransigeance is implemented 
by the weapons of material maturity. 

"We don't claim to know the 
purpose of the Universe, except, 
perhap»r-that its purpose is to divine its own purpose. But we do 
know that fire and the sword are 
not the tools for that fundamental 
research." 

Stand by, Stat. Test coming. 
Psych all six and cross-check 
with me. 

In clear. Hold Brodcuzynski or 
trauma possible. 

Brod was still thinking in a 
vague and delightfully pagan 
way about the Mizra people. 

Sam resumed his vocalizing to 
the six: "You find this difficult 
to grasp. A demonstration is more 
effective than many words." 

Sam, direct to A'hig Onefour, 
who was standing by the right 
hand of Athena watching the six 
Terrestrials in amused fascination: Come. 

One of the tall, blonde Mizra 
students who was standing by the 
right hand of Athena came across 
Hall toward our group. She halt

ed, smiling, within the half-circle 
we formed. 

In Earth terms : Aphrodite newrisen from caressing, milky-crested waves, an Amazonian Helen, 
a brazen Psyche, a Pompadour in 
free-limbed sports rig, a sexed 
angel, an aggregation of impossible but somehow attainable 
desire, a nymph rampant, a summation of sensuality, a positive 
aura of concupiscence — 

A'hig Onefour played the part 
well. 

Brodcuzynski : My God, what

Braithewaite : Sylvia — what is

her; holy fair and wise is she . . . 
A million ships by such a Helen!

from the bronze sword of her

formation? Fail to see. . . 

Sam, vocally, and direct to 
A'hig: "Would you please resume your natural form, Miss 
A'hig relinquishing that which 
• you and your colleagues adopted 
for the mental convenience of 
these gentlemen?" 

Badly put, Sam. Gross connotation. 

Doesn't matter. Psych them. 
I'm holding Brod together. 

And the blonde, the leggy 
blonde, the luscious blonde, became in slow dissolve — 

— using transliterated universal 
terms — 

— a multi-sexed, commendably 
developed brachialiferous thase, 
with its fifteen specialized arms

All stemmed from a"n acceptably odd oblate spheroid; a 
sweetly esthetic organization of 
functional necessity. Its very 
truth -in-purpose was beautiful 
. . . This language is so limited in 
its conceptual terminology. 

The psychic storm from the 
others nearly overwhelmed me, 
smashing like the ravening tumble of a cloudburst. 



T WAS sick, bedeviled, racked 
by fear, shaken by hate, until 
Sam put out a calming thought. 

You're identifying yourself, 
Stat. Come away, Help me psych 
and tabulate. i 

I withdrew and touched only 
what came to the surface. 

Brodcuzynski : Mental scream 
. . . This is- nightmare . . .I've 
gone mad . . . God let me look 
away . . . Fear . . . Hate . . . Kill it. 

Braithewaite : Sick disgust,

me ... Or hypnosis? . . . Kraken 
. . . Can't exist . . . Shouldn't exist 
. . . Worm that dieth not . . . 3

Sam struck in with his musical, 
little-used voice. It cut through 
the welter of near-madness. I 
heard only snatches of it in my 
own intense preoccupation: ". . . 
highest life-form on four planets 
of a system ... specialization . . . 
beautiful, is it not?" 

Aventos: Christ, planets 
swarming with them! . . . the star 
drive . . . sear them off . . . Cauterize, burn . . . monstrous horror 
. . . Never intelligence embodied 
thus . . . Line of guns thudding,

sundered alien flesh flying, 

M'Bassi : Jungle, night . . . Fear 
. . . Leaping creature, spear, kill 
or be killed . . . Redness and insane delight. 

Lao T'sung : Quick control, but 
vivid picture of heel squashing 
snake before blankout, and another obscene unverbalized picture. 

It was as though every racial 
hatred and fear of difference that 
had ever beset mankind welled 
up in a suppurating flow from 
their minds. 

Scientific curiosity and thus 
conscious sanity returned within 
seconds. But to Sam and me it 
seemed hours. 

Sam said: "I'm sorry to sifbject 
you to this, gentlemen, but we 
wanted immediate unconscious 
reactions. Had you been prepared, some of you might have retained rational control, according 
to your degree of advancement 
beyond atavistic xenophobia. But 
we are interested only in the 
degree of empathic rapport with 
other intelligences. 

Sam called up a chair from the 
floor of the Hall and sat in it 
casually. Our group was alone 
now in the vasthess of the Hall. 
A'hig, myself, and the six remained standing. 

SAM stroked his Roman nose 
again and tried to explain. 
"Suppose your colonizing vessel 



had landed on one of the planets 
inhabited by A'hig's fellows, and 
they had suddenly semblized near 
you, would the hand controlling 
your weapons be restrained by 
reason? Possibly. But fear might 
trigger the weapon, even if you 
were otherwise well-protected. 

"Suppose they approached you 
slowly and with circumspection, 
apparently in awe at your mastery of time and space, showing 
what you would take to be due 
humility in face of your technical achievements, could you 
learn to live in peace and cooperation with such — monsters? Especially when you learned they 
were your vast superiors in mental science? Yes, you say, but I 
doubt it. And there must be no 
doubt in such matters. You do 
not, it seems, know yourselves." 
He sighed. "Such a simple lesson, 
so long in the learning." 

"Totally unfair!" Aventos 
blurted. "A farcial test, springing 
something like that. Not that we 
concede you have any damned 
right to make any kind of test 
at all." 

"You confirm my views. Pride 
is a tiger and vanity its teeth." 
Sam, pleased with Lao T'Sung's 
quick control, had gone deep 
within him and found that proverb. " 'Unfair' and 'concede' mean 
nothing to us." 

Direct: Off now, Stat. Reporting to Top. Not unpleased, but

long, long yet. Take them. Unlearning the tongue. Find it slightly distasteful now. 

'"the question, gentlemen," 
Sam murmured, "is not whether 
the Universe is fit for Man, but 
whether Man is fit for the Universe. You have answered it. He 
is not— yet." 

He gestured toward shining 
Athena. "Know yourselves. Then 
return." 

He semblized himself to his 
room. 

Poor A'hig Onefour was becoming a little embarrassed. I sent a 
quick pleasure-scale to her-his-its 
vibration - mathematic - entertainment preen. Not so laughably 
removed from a wolf-whistle. 
Beautiful creature. 

Direct: Gratitude. That's all. 
Semblize off. Stay as sweet as 
you are. 

Query your meaning. Esthetic 
appreciation? ■ 

Sorry. Yes. Earth sexual. Habit. 
Thanks again. 

A'hig semblized. 

Braithewaite scratched his gray 
thatch. "What about this socalled examination?" 

"You've been undergoing it 



since you arrived. You've just 
failed your Finals. So — back to 
school, kids." 

Ahh, get away from me, you 
dirty black. You stink. 

Jim, Jim, there's a spider in the 
bath! Uggh, beastly thing, kill it! 
(delicate legs, sensitive quivering 
palps, a thousand diamonds for 
eyes, a sweetly odd oblate spheroid for main body, a sheen of 
iridescent purple and green. A 
smear of dark blood on white 
porcelain.) 

You lousy no-account halfbreed. 

I regret that our generous offer 
of an arrangement to restore a 
balance of trade has met with 
what can only be described as 
contempt. If such outrageous provocation should continue — 

See, you pull its wings off an' 
its gotta crawl, it's gotta crawl 
over this pencil, see? 

Hands off, punk, or I'll kick 
your teeth in. 

There's a mouse! Quick, quick,

Kinda saw red. Didn't mean to 
kill him, honest. 

Goddam furriners.
