The Sentimentalists By MURRAY LEINSTER 

RHADAMPSICUS and Nodalictha were on their 
honeymoon, and consequently they were sentimental. 
To be sure, it would not have 
been easy for humans to imagine 
sentiment as existing between 
them. Humans would hardly associate tenderness with glances 
cast from sets of sixteen eyes 
mounted on jointed eye stalks, 

nor link langorous thrills with a 
coy mingling of positronic rejafhlsion blasts — even when the emission of positron blasts from 
beneath one's mantle was one's 
normal personal mode of locomotion. And when two creatures 
like Rhadampsicus and Nodalic
tha stood on what might be 
it 

roughly described as their heads 
and twined their eye stalks together, so that they gazed fondly 
at each other with all sixteen eyes 
at once, humans would not have 
thought of it as the equivalent of 
a loving kiss. Humans would 
have screamed and run — if they 
were not paralyzed by the mere 
sight of such individuals. 

Nevertheless, they were a very 
happy pair and they were very 
sentimental, and it was probably

a good thing, considered from all 
angles. They were still newlyweds 
on their wedding tour — they had 
been married only seventy-five 
years before — when they passed 
by the sun that humans call Cetis 
Gamma. 

Rhadampsicus noted its peculiarity. He was anxious, of course, 
for their honeymoon to be memorable in every possible way. So 
he pointed it out to Nodalictha 
and explained what was shortly 
to be expected. She listened with 
a bride's rapt admiration of her 
new husband's wisdom. Perceiving his scientific interest, she suggested shyly that they stop and 
watch. 

T» HADAMPSICUS scanned 
the area. There were planets 
— inner ones, and then a group of 
gas giants, and then a very cosy 
series of three outer planets with 
surface temperatures ranging 
from three to seven degrees Kelvin. 

They changed course and landed on the ninth planet out, where 
the landscape was delightful. 
Rhadampsicus unlimbered his 
traveling kit and prepared a 
bower. Nitrogen snow rose and 
swirled and consolidated as he 
deftly shifted force-pencils. When 
the tumult subsided, there was a 
snug if primitive cottage for the 
two of them to dwell in while 
they waited for Cetis Gamma to 



accomplish its purpose. 

Nodalictha cried out softly 
when she entered the bower. She 
was fascinated by its completeness. There was even running 
liquid hydrogen from a little rill 
nearby. And over the doorway, 
as an artistic and appropriate 
touch, Rhadampsicus had put 
his own and Nodalictha's initials, 
pricked out in amber chlorine 
crystals and intertwined within 
the symbol which to them meant 
a heart. Nodalictha embraced him 
fondly for his thoughtfulness. Of 
course, no human would have 
recognized it as an embrace, but 
that did not matter. 

Happily, then, they settled 
down to observe the phenomenon 
that Cetis Gamma would presently display. They scanned the gas 
giant planets together, and then 
the inner ones. 

On the second planet out from 
the sun, they perceived small biped animals busily engaged in 
works of primitive civilization. 
Nodalictha was charmed. She 
asked eager questions, and Rhadampsicus searched his memory 
and told her that the creatures 
were not well known, but had 
been observed before. Limited in 
every way by their physical constitution, they had actually 
achieved a form of space travel 
by means of crude vehicles. He 
believed, he said, that the name 
they called themselves was "men."

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



^ |^HE sun rose slowly in the 
east, and Lon Simpson swore 
patiently as he tried for the 
eighteenth time to get the generator back again in a fashion to 
make it work. His tractor waited 
in the nearby field. The fields 
waited. Over in Cetopolis, the 
scales and storesheds waited, and 
somewhere there was doubtless a 
cargo ship waiting for a spacegram to summon it to Cetis 
Gamma Two for a load of thanar 
leaves. And of course people 
everywhere waited for thanar 
leaves. 

A milligram a day kept old 
age away — which was not an advertising slogan but sound, practical geriatric science. But thanar 
leaves would only grow on Cetis 
Gamma Two, and the law said 
that all habitable planets had to 
be open for colonization and land 
could not be withheld from 
market. 

There was too much population back on Earth, anyhow. 
Therefore the Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company couldn't make 
a planetwide plantation and keep 
thanar as a monopoly, but could 
only run its own plantation for 
research and instruction purposes for new colonists. Colonists 
had to be admitted to the planet, 
and they had to be sold land. 
But there are' ways of getting 
around every law. 

Lon Simpson swore. The Diesel 



of his tractor ran a generator. 
The generator ran the motors in 
the tractor's catawheels. But this 
was the sixth time in a month 
that the generator had broken 
down, and generators do not 
break down. 

Lon put it together for the 
eighteenth time this breakdown, 
and it still wouldn't work. Therewas nothing detectably wrong 
with it, but he couldn't make it 
work. 

Seething, he walked back to his 
neat, prefabricated house. He 
picked up the beamphone. Even 
Cathy's voice at the exchange in 
Cetopolis could not soothe him, 
he was so furious. 

"Cathy, give me Carson — and 
don't listen!" he said tensely. 

He heard clickings on the twoway beam. 

"My generator's gone," he said 
sourly when Carson answered. 
"I've repaired it twice this week. 
It looks like it was built to stop 
working! What is this all about, 
anyhow?" 

The representative of the Cetis 
Gamma Trading Company 
sounded bored. 

"You want a new generator 
sent out?" he asked without interest.- "Your crop credit's still 
all right — if the fields are in good 
shape." 

"I want machinery that 
works!" Lon Simpson snapped. 
"I want machinery that doesn't

121 



have to be bought four times 
over a growing season! And I 
want it at a decent price!" 

"Look, those generators come 
out from Earth. There's freight 
on them. There's freight on everything that comes out from Earth. 
You people come to a developed 
planet, you buy your land, your 
•machinery, your house, and you 
get instruction in agriculture. Do 
you want the company to tuck 
you in bed at night besides? Do 
you want a new generator or 
not?" 

"How much?" demanded Lon. 
When Carson told him, he hit the 
ceiling. "It's robbery! What'll I 
have left for my crop if I buy 
that?" 

CARSON'S voice was still 
bored. "If you buy it and your 
crop's up to standard, you'll owe 
the crop plus three hundred credits. But we'll stake you to next 
growing season." 

"And if I don't?" demanded 
Lon. "Suppose I don't give you 
all my work for nothing and 
wind up in debt?" 

"By contract," Carson told him, 
"we've got the right to finish cultivating your crop and charge 
you for the work because we've 
advanced you credit on it. Then 
we attach your land, and house 
for the balance due. And you get 
no more credit at the Company 
stores. And passage off this planet 



has to be paid for in cash." He 
yawned. "Don't answer now," he 
said without interest. "Call me 
back after you calm down. You'd 
only haie to apologize." 

Lon Simpson heard the click 
as he began to describe, heatedly, 
what was in his mind.. He said 
it anyhow. Then Cathy's voice 
came from the exchange. She 
sounded shocked but sympathetic. , 

"Lon! Please!" 

He swallowed a particularly 
inventive description of the manners, morals and ancestry 'of all 
the directors and employees of 
the Cetis Gamma Trading Company. Then he said, still fuming, 
"I told you not to listen!" 

His wrongs overcame him 
again. "It's robbery! It's peonage! They've got every credit I 
had! They've got three-quarters 
of the value of my crop charged 
up for replacements of the lousy 
machinery they sold me*-and 
now I'll end the growing season 
in debt! How am I going to ask 
you to marry me?" 

"Not over a beamphone, I 
hope," said Cathy. 

He was abruptly sunk in gloom. 

"That was a slip," he admitted. 
"I was going to wait until I got 
paid for my crop. It looked 
good. Now — " 

"Wait a minute, Lon," Cathy 
said. There was silence. She gave 
somebody else a connection. 



122 




 



The phone-beams from the 
colony farms all went to Cetopolis and Cathy was one of the 
two operators there. If or when 
the colony got prosperous enough, 
there would be a regular intercommunication system. So it was 
said. Meanwhile, Lon had a suspicion that there might be another reason for the antiquated 
central station. 

Cathy said brightly, "Yes, 
Lon?" 

"I'll come in to town tonight," 
he said darkly. "Date?" 

"Y-yes," stammered Cathy. 
"Oh, yes!" 

He hung up and went back 
out to the field and the tractor. 
He began to think sourly of a 
large number of things all at once. There was a law to encourage people to leave Earth for 
colonies on suitable planets. 
There was even governmental 
help for people who didn't have 
funds of their own. But if a man 
wanted to make something of 
himself, he preferred to use his 
own money and pick his own 
planet and choose his own way of 
life. 

Lon Simpson had bought four 
hectares of land on Cetis Gamma 
Two. He'd paid his passage out. 
He'd given five hundred credits 
a month for an instruction course 
on the Company's plantation, 
during which time he'd labored 
faithfully to grow, harvest, and 



cure thanar leaves for the Company's profit. Then he'd bought 
farm machinery from the Company — and a house — and very 
painstakingly had set out to be 
a colonist on his own. 

JUST about that time, Cathy 
had arrived on a Company 
ship and taken up her duties as 
beamphone operator at Cetopolis. 
It was a new colony, with not 
more than five thousand humans 
on the whole planet, all of them 
concentrated near the one small 
town with its plank sidewalks 
and prefabricated buildings. Lon 
Simpson met Cathy, and his labors on his thanar farm acquired 
new energy and purpose. 

But he was up against a shrewd 
organization. His inordinately expensive farm machinery broke 
down. He repaired it. After a 
time it could not be repaired any 
longer and he had to buy more. 
Before the thanar plants were half 
grown, he owed more than half 
his prospective crop for machinery replacements. 

Now he could see the method 
perfectly. The Company imported 
all machinery. It made that machinery in its own factories, 
machinery that was designed to 
break down. So this year — even 
if nothing else happened — Lon 
would wind up owing more for 
machinery replacements than the 
crop would bring. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



123 



It was not likely that nothing 
else would happen. Next season 
he would start off in debt, instead 
of all clear, and if the same thing 
happened he would owe all his 
crop and be six thousand credits 
behind. By harvest after next, his 
farm and house could be foreclosed for debt and he could 
either try to work for other colonists — who were in the process of 
going through the same wringer 
themselves — or hire out as a 
farmhand on the Company's 
plantation. He would never be 
able to save space-fare away from 
the planet. He would be very 
much worse off than the assisted 
emigrants to other planets, who 
had not invested all they owned 
in land and machinery and agricultural instructions. 

And there was Cathy. She owed 
for her passage. It would be 
years before she could pay that 
back, if ever. She couldn't live 
in the farmhand barracks. They 
might as well give up thinking 
about each other. 

It was a system. Beautifully 
legal, absolutely airtight. Not a 
thing wrong with it. The Company had a monopoly on thanar, 
despite the law. It had all the 
cultivated land on Cetis Gamma 
Two under its control, and its 
labor problem was -solved. Its 
laborers first paid something like 
sixteen thousand credits a head 
for the privilege of trying to farm 



independently for a year or two, 
and then became farmhands for 
the Company at a bare subsistence wage. 

Lon Simpson was in the grip of 
that system. He had taken the 
generator apart and put it back 
together eighteen times. There 
was nothing visibly wrong with it. 
It had been designed to break 
down with nothing visibly wrong 
with it. I£ he couldn't repair it, 
though, he was out fifteen hundred credits, his investment was 
wiped out, and all his hopes w.ere 
gone. 

He took the generator apart for 
the nineteenth time. He wondered 
grimly how the Company's designers made generators so cleverly that they would stop working 
so that even the trouble with 
them couldn't be figured out. It 
was a very ingenious system. 

r\UT on the ninth planet, 
Rhadampsicus explained the 
situation to his bride as they 
waited for the interesting astronomical phenomenon. They were 
quite cosy, waiting. Their bower 
was simple, of course. Frozen 
nitrogen walls, and windows of 
the faint bluish tint of oxygen ice. 
Rhadampsicus had grown some 
cyanogen flower-crystals to make 
the place look homelike, and 
there was now a lovely reflectionpool in which liquid hydrogen 
reflected the stars. Cetis Gamma, 



124 




 



the local sun, seemed hardly more 
than a very bright and very near 
star — it was four light-hours 
away — and it glimmered over the 
landscape and made everything 
quite charming. 

Nodalictha, naturally, would 
not enter the minds of the male 
bipeds on the inner planet. Modesty forbade such a thing — as, of 
course, the conscientiousness of 
a brand-new husband limited 
Rhadampsicus to the thoughts of 
the males among the" bipeds. But 
Nodalictha was distressed when 
Rhadampsicus told her of what 
was occurring among the bipeds. 
He guided her thoughts to Cathy, 
in the beamphone exchange at 
Cetopolis. 

"But it is terrible!" said Nodalictha in distress when she had 
absorbed Cathy's maiden meditations. She did not actually 
speak in words and soundwaves. 
There is no air worth mentioning 
at seven degrees Kelvin. It's all 
frozen. A little helium hangs 
around, perhaps. Nothing else. 
The word for communication is 
not exactly the word for speech, 
but it will do. Nodalictha said, 
"They love each other! In a cute 
way, they are like — like we were, 
Rhadampsicus!". 

Rhadampsicus played a positron-beam on her in feigned indignation. If that beam had hit 
a human, the human would have 
curled up in a scorched, smoking 



heap. But Nodalictha bridled. 

"Rhadampsicus!" she protested fondly. "Stop tickling me ! But 
can't you do 4 something for them? 
They are so cute!" 

And Rhadampsicus gallantly 
sent his thoughts back to the 
second planet, where a biped 
grimly labored over a primitive 
device. 

T ON Simpson, staring at the 
-"- < disassembled generator, suddenly blinked. The grimness went 
out of his expression. He stared. 
An idea had occurred to him. He 
went over it in his mind. He blew 
out his breath in a long whistle. 
Then, very painstakingly, he did 
four or five things that completely ruined the generator for the 
extremely modest trade-in allowance he could have gotten for it 
at the Company store. 

He worked absorbedly for perhaps twenty minutes, his eyes intent. At the end of that time he 
had threads of unwound secondary wire stretched back and forth 
across a forked stick of dhil weed, 
and two small pieces of sheet iron 
twisted together in an extremely 
improbable manner. He connected the ends of the secondary wire 
to contacts in his tractor. He 
climbed into the tractor seat. He 
threw over the drive control. 

The tractor lurched into motion. The Diesel wasn't running. 
But the tractor rolled comfort


THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



125 



ably as Lon drove it, the individual motors in the separate 
catawheels drawing power from a 
mere maze of wires across a 
forked stick — plus two pieces of 
sheet iron. There was plenty of 
power. 

Lon drove the tractor the rest 
of the morning and all afternoon 
with a very peculiar expression 
on his face. He understood what 
he had done. Now that he had 
done it, it seemed the most 
obvious of expedients. He felt inclined to be incredulous that nobody had ever happened to think 
of this particulars-device before. 
But they very plainly hadn't. It 
was a source of all the electric 
power anybody could possibly 
want. The voltage would depend 
on the number of turns of copper 
wire around a suitably forked 
stick. The amperage would be 
whatever that voltage could put 
through whatever was hooked to 
it. 

He no longer needed a new 
generator for his tractor. He had 
one. 

He didn't even need a Diesel. 

With adequate power — he'd 
been having to nurse the Diesel 
along, too, lately — Lon Simpson 
ran his tractor late into the twilight. He cultivated all the ground 
that urgently needed. cultivation, 
and at least one field he hadn't 
hoped to get to before next week. 
But his expression was amazed. 



It is a very peculiar sensation to 
discover that one is a genius. 

*» 

THAT night, in Cetopolis, he 
told Cathy all about it. It . 
was a very warm night — an unusually warm night. They walked : 
along the plank sidewalks of the 
little frontier town — as a new 
colony, Cetis Gamma Two was a 
frontier — and Lon talked extravagantly. '' 

He had meant to explain painfully to Cathy that there was" no 
use in their being romantic about 
each other. He'd expected to have 
to tell - her bitterly that he was i 
doomed to spend the rest of his j 
life adding to the profits of the i 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company, j 
with all the laws of the human j 
race holding him in peonage. He'd 1 
thought of some very elegant de- H 
scriptions of the sort of people 
who'd worked out the system in 
force on Cetis Gamma Two. < 
But he didn't. As they strolled | 
under the shiver trees that lined > 
the small town's highways, and . « 
smelled the chanel bushes beyond S 
the town's limits, and listened to ; 
the thin violinlike strains of what i 
should have been night birds — 
they weren't; the singers were 
furry instead of feathered, and 
they slept in burrows during the 
day — as they walked with linked 
fingers in the warm and starlit 
night, Lon told Cathy about his 
invention. 



126 




 



He explained in detail just why 
wires wound in just that fashion, 
and combined with bits of sheet 
iron twisted in just those shapes, 
would produce power for free and 
forever. He explained how it had 
to be so. He marveled that nobody had ever thought of it before. He explained it so that 
Cathy could almost understand 
it. 

"It's wonderful!" she said wistfully. "They'll run spaceships on 
your invention, won't they, Lon? 
And cities? And everything! I 
guess you'll be very rich for inventing it!" 

He stopped short and stared at 
her. He hadn't thought that far 
ahead. Then he said blankly: 

"But I'll have to get back to 
Earth to patent it! And I haven't 
got the money to pay one fare, let 
alone two!" 

"Two?',' asked Cathy hopefully. "Why two?" 

"You're going to marry me, 
aren't you?" he demanded. "I 
sort of hope that was all settled." 

Cathy stamped her foot. 

"Hadn't you heard," she asked 
indignantly, "that such things 
aren't taken for granted? Especially when two people are walking in the starlight and are 
supposed to be thrilled? It isn't 
settled — not until after you've 
kissed me, anyhow!" 

He remedied his error. 



i"VUT on the ninth planet, very 
far away, Nodalictha blushed slightly. As a bride, she was 
in that deliciously embarrassing 
state of becoming accustomed to 
discussions which would previously have been unconventional. 

"They are so quaint!" Then she 
hesitated and said awkwardly, 
"The idea of putting their — their 
lips together as a sign of affection — " 

Rhadampsicus was amused, as 
a bridegroom may be by the de r 
lightful innocences of a new wife. 
He evinced his amusement in a 
manner no human being could 
conceivably have recognized as 
the tender laugh it was. 

"Little goose!" he said fondly. 
Of course, instead of a fowl, he 
thought of a creature that had 
thirty-four legs and scales instead 
of feathers and was otherwise 
thoroughly ungooselike. "Little 
goose, they do that because they 
can't do this!" 

And he twined his eye stalks 
sentfmentally about hers. 

T"|AYS passed on Cetis Gamma 
Two. Lon Simpson cultivated his thanar fields. But he began to worry. His new power 
source was more than a repair 
for a broken-down tractor. It was 
valuable. It was riches! He had 
in it one of those basic, overwhelmingly important discoveries 
by which human beings have 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



127 



climbed up from the status of intelligent Earthbound creatures to 
galactic colonists — And a lot of 
good it had done them! 

It was a basic principle for 
power supply that would relieve 
mankind permanently of the burden of fuels. The number of planets available for colonization 
would be multiplied. The cost of 
every object made by human beings would be reduced by the 
previous cost of power. The price 
of haulage from one planet to 
another would be reduced to a 
fraction. Every member of the 
human race would become richer 
as a result of the gadget now attached to Lon Simpson's tractor. 
He was entitled to royalties on 
the wealth he was to distribute. 
But ... 

He was a thanar farmer on 
Cetis Gamma Two. His crop was 
mortgaged. He could not possibly 
hope to raise enough money to 
get back to Earth to arrange for 
the marketing of his invention. 
Especially, he could not conceivably raise money enough to take 
Cathy with him. He had riches, 
but they weren't available. And 
something else might happen to 
ruin him at any time. 

Something else did. The freezer 
element of his deep-freeze locker 
broke down. He didn't notice it. 
He had a small kitchen locker in 
which food for week-to-week use 
was stored. He didn't know any


thing about the deep-freeze unit 
that held a whole growing season's supply of food. The food in 
it — all imported from Earth and 
very expensive — thawed, fermented, spoiled, developed evil smelling gases, and waited for an 
'appropriate moment to reveal itself as a catastrophe. 

There were other things to worry about at the time. A glacier up 
at Cetis Gamma Two's polar region began to retreat, instead of 
growing as was normal for the 
season. There was a remarkable 
solar prominence of three days' 
duration swinging around the 
equator of the local sun. There 
was a meeting of directors of the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company, 
at which one of the directors 
pointed out that the normal curve 
of increase" for profits was beginning to flatten out, and something 
had to be done to improve the 
financial position of the company. Ugly sun-spots appeared 
on the northern hemisphere of 
Cetis Gamma. If there had been 
any astronomers on the job, there 
would have been as much excitement as a four alarm fire. But 
there were no astronomers. 

The greatest agitation on the 
second planet of Cetis Gamma 
Two was felt by Lon Simpson. 
Cathy had made friends with a 
married woman colonist who 
would chaperon her on a visit to 
Lon's farm, and was coming 



128 




 



out to visit and see the place that 
was to be the scene of the ineffable, unparalleled happiness she 
and Lon would know after they 
were married. 

She came, she saw, she was 
captivated. Lon blissfully opened 
the door of the house she was to 
share. He had spent the better 
part of two days cleaning up so 
it would be fit for her to look at. 
Cathy entered. There was a dull, 
booming noise, a hissing, and a. 
bubbling, and then a rank stench 
swept through the house and 
strangled them. 

'■THE boom, of course, was the 
-■- bursting open of the deepfreeze locker from the pressure 
of accumulated gases within it. 
The smell was that of the deepfreeze contents, ten days thawed 
out without Lon knowing it. 
There are very few smells much 
worse than frozen fish gone very, 
very bad in a hot climate. If there 
are worse smells, they come from 
once-frozen eggs bursting from 
their shells when pressure outside 
them is relieved. In this case, 
trimmings were added by fermenting strawberries, moldy meat 
and badly decayed vegetables, 
all triumphantly making themselves known at the same instant. 

Cathy gasped and choked. Lon 
got her out of doors, gasping himself. It was not difficult to deduce 
what had happened. 



He opened the house windows 
from the outside, so the smell 
could go away. But he knew despair. 

"I— can't show you the house, 
Cathy," he said numbly. "My 
locker went bad and all the food 
followed suit." 

"Lon!" wailed Cathy. "It's terrible! How will you eat?" 

Lon began to realize that the 
matter was more serious than the 
loss of an opportunity for a sentimental inspection of the house. 
He had dreamed splendidly, of 
late. He didn't quite know how 
he was going to manage it, but 
since his tractor was working 
magnificently he had come to 
picture himself and Cathy in the 
role of successful colonists, zestfully growing thanar leaves for 
the increasing multitudes of people who needed a milligram a 
day. 

He'd reverted to the pictured 
dreams in the Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company's advertisements. He'd daydreamed of himself and Cathy as growing with 
the colony, thriving as it throve, 
and ultimately becoming moderately rich — in children and grandchildren, anyhow — with life 
stretching out before them in a 
sort of rosy glow. He'd negligently assumed that somehow they 
would also be rich from the royalties on his invention. But now 
he came down to reality. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



129 



His house was uninhabitable 
for the time being. He could continue to cultivate his fields, but 
he wouldn't be able to eat. The 
local plant-life was not suitable 
for human digestion. He had to 
live on food imported from 
Earth. Now he had to buy a new 
stock from the Company, and it 
would bankrupt him. 

With an invention worth more 
— probably — than the Cetis Gamma Company itself, if he could 
realize on it, he still was broke. 
His crop was mortaged. If Carson learned about his substitute 
for a generator, the Company 
would immediately clamp down 
to get it away from him. 

He took Cathy back to Cetopolis. He feverishly appealed to 
other colonists. He couldn't tell 
them about his generator substitute. If they knew about it, in 
time Carson would know. If they 
used it, Carson would eventually 
get hold of a specimen, to send 
back to Earth for pirating by the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company. 
All Lon could do was try desperately to arrange to borrow 
food to live on until his crop 
came in, though even then he 
wouldn't be in any admirable 
situation. 

He couldn't borrow food in 
quantity. Other colonists had 
troubles, too. They'd give him a 
meal, yes, but they couldn't refill 
his freezer without emptying 



their own. Which would compel 
them to buy more. Which would 
be charged against their crops. 
Which would simply hasten the 
day when they * would become 
day-laborers on the Company's 
thanar farm. 

Lon had about two days' food 
in the kitchen locker. He determined to stretch it to four. Then 
he'd have to buy more. With each 
meal, then, his hopes of freedom 
and prosperity — and Cathy — 
grew less. 

Of course, he could starve . . . 

RHADAMPSICUS was enormously and pleasantly interested in what went on in Cetis 
Gamma's photosphere. From the 
ninth planet, he scanned the 
prominences with enthusiasm, 
making notes. Nodalictha tried to 
take a proper wifely interest in 
her husband's hobby, but she 
could not keep it up indefinitely. 
She busied herself with her 
housekeeping. She fashioned a 
carpet of tufted methane fibres 
and put up curtains at the windows. She enlarged the garden 
Rhadampsicus had* made, adding 
borders of crystallized ammonia 
and a sort of walkway with a 
hedge of monoclinic sulphur 
which glittered beautifully in the 
starlight. She knew that this was 
only a temporary dwelling, but 
she wanted Rhadampsicus to realize that she, could make any 



130 




 



place a comfortable home. 

He remained absorbed in the 
phenomena of the local sun. One 
great prominence, after five days 
of spectacular existence, divided 
into two which naturally moved 
apart and stationed themselves 
at opposite sides of the sun's 
equator. They continued to rotate with the sun itself, giving 
very much the effect of an incipient pin wheel. Two other minor 
prominences came into being 
midway between them. Rhadampsicus watched in fascination. 

Nodalictha came and reposed 
beside him on a gentle slope of 
volcanic slag. She waited for him 
to notice her. She would not let 
herself be sensitive about his interest in his hobby, of course, 
but she could not really find it 
absorbing for herself. A trifle 
wistfully, she sent her thoughts 
to the female biped on the second 
planet. 

After a while she said in distress, "Rhadampsicus! Oh, they 
are so unhappy!" 

Rhadampsicus gallantly turned his attention from the happenings on the sun. 

"What's that, darling?" 

"Look!" said Nodalictha plaintively. "They are so much in 
love, Rhadampsicus! "And they 
can't marry because he hasn't 
anything edible to share with 
her!" 



Rhadampsicus scanned. He 
was an ardent and sentimental 
husband. If his new little wife 
was distressed about anything at 
all, Rhadampsicus was splendidly ready to do something 
about it. 

T ON SIMPSON looked at his 
kitchen locker. The big deepfreezer was repaired now. Once 
a season, a truck came out from 
Cetopolis and filled it. The food 
was costly. A season's supply was 
kept in deep-freeze. Once in one 
or two weeks, one refilled the 
kitchen locker. It was best to 
leave the deep-freeze locker 
closed as much as possible. But 
now the big deep-freeze was_ 
empty. He'd cleaned out the 
ghastly mess in it, and he had it 
running again, but he had nothing to put in it. To have it refilled would put him hopelessly 
at the Company's mercy, but 
there was nothing else to do. 

Bitterly, he called the Trading 
Company office, and Carson answered. 

"This is Simpson," Lon told 
him. "How much — " 

"The price for a generator," 
said Carson, bored, "is the same 
as before. Do you want it sent 
out?" — 

"No! My food locker broke 
down. My food store spoiled. I 
need more." 

"I'll figure it," replied Carson 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



131 



over the beamphone. He didn't 
seem interested. After a moment, 
he said indifferently, "Fifteen 
hundred credits for standard rations to crop time. ^Fhen you'll 
need more." 

"It's robbery!" raged Lon. "I 
can't expect more than four thousand credits for my crop! You've 
got three thousand charged 
against me now!" 

Carson yawned. "True. A new 
generator, fifteen hundred; new 
food supplies fifteen hundred. If 
your crop turns out all right, 
you'll start the new season with 
two thousand credits charged up 
as a loan against your land." 

Lon Simpson strangled on his 
fury. "You'll take all my leaves 
and I'll still owe you! Then credit 
for seed and food and — If I need 
to buy more machinery, you'll 
own my farm and crop next crop 
time! Even if my crop is good! 
Your damned Company will own 
my farm!" 

"That's your lookout," Carson 
said without emotion. "Being a 
thanar farmer was your idea, not 
mine. Shall I send out the food?" 

Lon Simpson bellowed into the 
beamphone. He heard clicking, 
then Cathy's voice. It was at on«e 
reproachful and sympathetic. 

"Lon! Please!" 

"OUT Lon couldn't talk to her. 

He panted at her, and hung 
up. It is essential to a young man 



in love that he shine, somehow, in 
the eyes of the girl he cares for. 
Lon was not shining. He was appearing as the Galaxy's prize sap. 
He'd invested a sizable fortune 
in his farm. He was a good farmer — hard-working and skilled. In 
the matter of repairing generators, he'd proved to be a genius. 
But he was at the mercy of the 
Cetis Gamma Company's representative. He was already in debt. 
If he wanted to go on eating, he'd 
go deeper. If he were careful and 
industrious and thrifty, the Trading Company would take his crop 
and farm in six more months and 
then give him a job at day-labor 
wages. 

He went grimly to the kitchen 
of his home. He looked at the 
trivial amount of food remaining. 
He was hungry. He could eat it 
all right now. 

If he did— 

Then, staring at the food in 
the kitchen locker, he blinked. An 
idea had occurred to him. He was 
blankly astonished at it. He went 
over and over it in his mind. His 
expression became dubiously 
skeptical, and then skeptically 
amazed. But his eyes remained 
intent as he thought. 

Presently, looking very skeptical indeed, he went out of the 
house and \mwound more copper 
wire from the remnant of the disassembled generator. He came 
back to the kitchen. He took an 



132 




 



emptied tin can and cut it in a 
distinctly peculiar manner. The 
cuts he made were asymmetrical. 
When he had finished, he looked 
at it doubtfully. 

A long time later he had made 
a new gadget. It consisted of two 
open coils, one quite large and 
one quite small. Their resemblance to each other was plain, 
but they did not' at all resemble 
any other coils that had been 
made for any other purpose whatsoever. If they looked like anything, it was the "mobiles" that 
some sculptors once insisted were 
art. 

Lon stared at his work with an 
air of helplessness. Then he went 
out again. He returned with the 
forked stick that had proved to 
be a generator. He connected the 
wires from that improbable contrivance to the coils of the new 
and still more unlikely device. 
The eccentrically cut tin can 
was in the middle, between them. 

There was a humming sound. 
Lon went out a third time and 
came back with a mass of shrubbery. He packed it in the large 
coil. 

He muttered to himself, "I'm 
out of my head! I'm crazy!" 

But then he went to the kitchen locker. He put a small packet of frozen green peas in the tin 
can between the two coils. 

The humming sound increased. 
After a moment there was an


other parcel of green peas — not 
frozen — in the small coil. 

Lon took it out. The device 
hummed more loudly again. Immediately there was another parcel of green peas in the small 
coil. He took them out. 

When he had six parcels of 
green peas instead of one, the 
mass of foliage in the large coil 
collapsed abruptly. Lon disconnected the wires and removed the 
debris. The native foliage looked 
shrunken, somehow, dried-out. 
Lon tossed it through the window. 

TJE put a parcel of unfrozen 
green peas on to cook and 
sat down and held his head in his 
hands. He knew what had happened. He knew how. 

The local flora on Cetis Gamma Two naturally contained the 
same chemical elements as the 
green peas imported from Earth. 
Those elements were combined in 
chemical 'compounds similar, if 
not identical to, those of the 
Earth vegetation. The new gadget simply converted the compounds in the large coil to match 
those in the sample — in the tin 
can — and assembled them in the 
small coil according to the physical structure of the sample. In 
this case, as green peas. 

The device would take any approximate compound from the 
large coil and reassemble it — 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



133 



suitably modified as per sample 
— in the small coil. It would work 
not only for green peas, but for 
roots, barks, herbs, berries, blossoms and flowers. 

It would even work for thanar 
leaves. 

When that last fact occurred to 
him, Lon Simpson went quietly 
loony, trying to figure out how he 
had come to think of such a thing. 
He was definitely crocked, because he picked up the beamphone and told Cathy all about 
it. And he was not loony because 
he told Cathy, but because he 
forgot his earlier suspicions of 
why there was a central station 
for beamphones in Cetopolis, instead of a modern direct-communication system. 

In fact, he forgot the system in 
operation on Cetis Gamma Two 
— the Company's system. It had 
been designed to put colonists 
through the wringer and deposit 
them at its own farm to be daylaborers forever with due regard 
to human law. But it was a very 
efficient system. 

It took care of strokes of genius, too. 

That night, Carson, listening 
boredly to the record of all the 
conversations over the beamphone during the day, heard what 
Lon had told Cathy. He didn't 
believe it, of course. 

But he made a memo to look 
into it. 




RHADAMPSICUS stretched 
himself. Out on the ninth 
planet, the weather was slightly 
warmer — almost six degrees Kelvin, two hundred and sixty-odd 
degrees centigrade below zero — 
and he was inclined to be lazy. 
But he was very handsome, in 
Nodalictha's- eyes. He was seven


134 




 



ty or more feet from his foremost 
eye stalk to the tip of his least 
crimson appendage, and he fluoresced beautifully in the starlight. 
He was a very gallant young 
bridegroom. 

When he saw Nodalictha looking at him admiringly, he said 
with his customary tenderness: 



"It was fatiguing to make him 
go through it, darling, but since 
you wished it, it is done. He now 
has food to share with the female." 

"And you're handsome, too, 
Rhadampsicus !" Nodalictha said 
irrelevantly. 

She felt as brides sometimes do 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



135 



on their honeymoons. She was 
quite sure that she had not only 
the bravest and handsomest of 
husbands, but the most thoughtful and considerate. 

Presently, with their eye stalks 
intertwined, he asked softly: 

"Are you weary of this place, 
darling? I would like to watch 
the rest of this rather rare phenomenon, but if you're not interested, we can go on. And truly 
I won't mind." 

"Of course we'll stay!" protested Nodalictha. "I want to do 
anything you want to. I'm perfectly happy just being with 
you." 

And, unquestionably, she was. 

|^ARSON, though bored, was a 
^* bit upset by the recorded conversation he'd listened to. Lon 
Simpson had been almost incoherent, but he obviously meant 
Cathy to take him seriously. And 
there were some things to back 
it up. 

He'd reported his generator 
hopelessly useless — and hadn't 
bought a new one. He'd reported 
all his food spoiled — and hadn't 
bought more. Carson thought it 
over carefully. The crop inspection helicopter reported Simpson's fields in much better shape 
than average, so his tractor was 
obviously working. 

Carson asked casual, deadpan 
questions of other colonists who 



came into the Company store. 
Most of them were liarried, sullen 
and bitter. They were unanimously aware of the wringer they 
were being put through. They 
knew what the Company was 
doing to them and they hated 
Carson because he represented it. 
But they did answer Carson's 
casual questions about Lon 
Simpson. 

Yes, he'd tried to borrow food 
from them. No, they couldn't 
lend it to him. Yes, he was still 
eating. In fact he was offering to 
swap food. He was short on fruit 
and long on frozen green peas. 
Then he was long on fruit and 
frozen green peas and short on 
frozen sweet corn and strawberries. No, he didn't want to trade 
on a big scale. One package of 
frozen strawberries was all he 
wanted. He gave six packages of 
frozen peas for it. He gave six 
packages of frozen strawberries 
for one package of frozen sweet 
corn. He'd swapped a dozen parcels of sweet corn for one of fillet 
of flounder, two dozen fillet of 
flounder for cigarettes, and fifty 
cartons of cigarettes for a frozen 
roast of beef. 

It didn't make sense unless the 
conversation on the beamphone 
was right. If what Lon had told 
Cathy was true, he'd have his 
frozen food locker filled up again 
by now. He had some sort of device which converted the indi


136 




 



gestible local flora and fauna into 
digestible Earth products. To 
suspect such a thing was preposterous, but Carson suspected everyone and everything. 

As representative of the Company, Carson naturally did its 
dirty work. New colonists bought 
farms from the central office on 
Earth and happily took ship to 
Cetis Gamma Two. Then Carson 
put them through their instruction course, outfitted them to try 
farming on their own, and saw 
to it that they went bankrupt 
and either starved or took jobs 
as farmhands for the Company, 
at wages assuring that they could 
never take ship away again. 

It was a nasty job and Carson 
did it very well, because he loved it. 

While he still debated Lon's 
insane boasts to Cathy over the 
beamphone system, he prepared 
to take over the farm of another 
colonist. That man had been 
deeper in debt than Lon, and he'd 
been less skilled at repairs, so it 
was time to gather him in. Carson called him to Cetopolis to 
tell him that the Company regretfully could not extend further 
credit, would have to take back 
his farm, house, and remaining 
food stores, and finish the cultivation of his thanar leaf crop to repay itself for the trouble. 

The colonist, however, said 
briefly: "Go to hell." 



TTE started to leave Carson's 
air-cooled office. Carson said 
mildly : 

"You're broke. You'll want a 
job when you haven't got a farm. 
You can't afford to tell me to go 
to hell." 

"You can't take my farm unless my fields are neglected," the 
colonist said comfortably. "They 
aren't. And my thanar leaf crop is 
going to be a bumper one. I'll 
pay off all I owe — and we colonists are planning to start a trading company of our own, to bring 
in good machinery and deal 
fairly." 

Carson smiled coldly, 

"You forget something," he 
said. "As representative of the 
Trading Company, I can call on 
you to pay up all your debts at 
once, if I have reason to think 
you intend to try to evade payment. I do think so. I call on 
you for immediate payment in 
full. Pay up, please!" 

This was an especially neat 
paragraph in the fine print of the 
colonists' contract with the Company. Any time a colonist got 
obstinate he could be required to 
pay all he owed, on the dot. And 
if he had enough to pay, he 
wouldn't owe. So the Trading 
Company could ruin anybody. 

But this colonist merely grinned. 

"By law," he observed, "you 
have to accept thanar leaves as 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



137 



legal tender, at five credits a 
kilo. Send out a truck for your 
payment. I've got six tons in my 
barn, all ready to turn in." 

He made a most indecorous 
gesture and walked out. A moment later, he put his head back 
in. 

"I forgot," he commented politely. "You said I couldn't afford 
to tell you to go to hell. With six 
tons of thanar leaves on hand, 
I'm telling you to — " 

He added several other things, 
compared to which telling Carson to go to hell was the height of 
courtesy. He went away. 

Carson went a little pale. It 
occurred to him that this colonist was a close neighbor of Lon 
Simpson. Maybe Lon had gotten 
tired of converting dhil weed and 
shiver leaves into green peas and 
asparagus, and had gotten to 
work turning out thanar. 

CARSON went to Lon's farm. 
It was a very bad road, and 
any four-wheeled vehicle would 
have shaken itself to pieces on 
the way. The gyrocar merely jolted Carson severely. The jolting 
kept him from noticing how hot 
the weather was. It was really 
extraordinarily hot, and Carson 
suffered more because he spent 
most of his time in an air-conditioned office. But for the same 
reason he did not suspect anything abnormal. 



When he reached Lon's farm, 
he noticed that the thanar leaves 
were growing admirably. For a 
moment, sweating as he was, he 
was reminded of tobacco plants 
growing on Maryland hillsides. 
The heat and the bluish-green 
color of the plants seemed very 
familiar. But then a cateagle ran 
hastily up a tree, out on a branch, 
and launched its crimson furry 
self into midair. That broke the 
spell of supposedly familiar 
things. 

Carson turned his gyrocar in 
at Lon Simpson's house. There 
were half a dozen other colonists 
around. Two of them drove up 
with farm trucks loaded with 
mixed foliage. They had pulled 
up, cut off and dragged down 
just about anything that grew, 
and loaded their truck with it. 
Two other colonists were loading 
another cart with thanar leaves, 
neatly bundled and ready for the 
warehouse. 

They regarded Carson with 
pleased eyes. Carson spoke severely to Cathy. 

"What are you doing here? 
You're supposed to be on duty 
at the beamphone exchange! You 
can be discharged — " 

Lon Simpson said negligently, 
"I'm paying her passage. By law, 
anybody can pay the passage of 
any woman if she intends to 
marry him, and then her contract with the company is ended. 



138 




 



They had rules like that in ancient days — only they used to pay 
in tobacco instead of thanar 
leaves." 

Carson gulped. "But how will 
you pay her fare?" He asked 
sternly. "You're in debt to the 
Company yourself." 

Lon Simpson jerked his thumb 
toward his barn. Carson turned 
and looked. It was a nice-looking 
barn. The aluminum siding set 
it off against a backing of shiver 
trees, dhil and giant sketit 
growth. Carson's eyes bugged out. 
Lon's barn was packed so tightly 
with thanar leaves that they 
bulged out the doors. 

"I need to turn some of that 
stuff in, anyhow," said Lon 
pleasantly. "I haven't got storage space for it. By law you have 
to buy it at five credits a kilo. 
I wish you'd send out and get 
some. I'd like to build up some 
credit. Think I'll take a trip back 
to Earth." 

At this moment, there was a 
very peculiar wave of heat. It was 
riot violent, but the temperature 
went up about four degrees — suddenly, as if somebody had turned 
on a room heater. 

But still nobody looked up at 
the sun. 

T> ATTLED, Carson demanded 
furiously if Lon had converted other local foliage into thanar 
leaves, as he'd made his green 



peas and the other stuff he'd told 
Cathy about on the beamphone. 
Lon tensed, and observed to the 
other colonists that evidently all 
beamphones played into recorders. The atmosphere became unfriendly. Carson got more rattled 
still. He began to wave his arms 
and sputter. 

Lon Simpson treated him gently. He took him into the house to 
watch the converter at work. One 
of the colonists kept its large 
coil suitably stuffed with assorted 
foliage. There was a "hand" of 
cured, early — best quality — thanar leaves in an erratically cut tin 
can. Duplicates of that hand of 
best quality thanar were appearing in the small coil as fast as 
they were removed, and fresh 
foliage was being heaped into the 
large coil. 

"We expect," said Lon happily, 
"to have a bumper crop of the 
best grade of thanar this year. It 
looks like every colonist on the 
planet will be able to pay off his 
debt to the Company and have 
credit left over. We'll be sending 
a committee back to Earth to 
collect our credits there and organize an independent cooperative trading company that will 
bring out decent machinery and 
be a competitive buying agency 
for thanar. I'm sure the Company will be glad to see us all so 
prosperous." 

It was stifling hot by now, but 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



139 



nobody noticed. The colonists 
were much too interested in seeing Carson go visibly to pieces 
before them. He was one of those 
people who seem to have been 
developed by an all-wise Providence expressly to be underlings 
for certain types of large corporations. Their single purpose in life 
is to impress their superiors in 
the corporation that hires them. 
But now Carson saw his usefulness ended. Through his failure, 
in some fashion, the Company's 
monopoly on thanar leaves and 
its beautiful system of recruiting 
labor were ruined. He would be 
discharged and probably blacklisted. 

If he had looked up toward the 
western sky, squinted a little, and 
gazed directly at the local sun, 
he would have seen that his private troubles were of no importance at all. But he didn't. He 
went staggering to his gyrocar 
and headed back for Cetopolis. 

It was a tiny town, with plank 
streets, a beamphone exchange, 
and its warehouses over by the 
spaceport. It was merely a crude 
and rather ugly little settlement 
on a newly colonized planet. But 
it had been the center of an admirable system by which the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company 
got magnificently rich and dispensed thanar leaf (a milligram 
a day kept old age away) 
throughout all humanity at the 



very top price the traffic would 
bear. And the system was shaky 
now and Carson would be blamed 
for it. 

Behind him, the colonists rejoiced as hugely as Carson suffered. But none of them got the 
proper perspective, because none 
of them looked at the sun. 

About four o'clock in the afternoon, it got suddenly hotter 
again, as abruptly as before. It 
stayed hotter. Something made 
Cathy look up. There was a thin 
cloud overhead, just the right 
thickness to act something like 
a piece of smoked glass. She 
could look directly at the sun 
through it, examine the disk with 
her naked eye. 

But it wasn't a disk any longer. 
Cetis Gamma was a bulging, irregularly shaped thing twice its 
normal size. As she looked, it 
grew larger still. 

OUT on the ninth planet, Rhadampsicus was absorbed in 
his contemplation of Cetis Gamma. With nothing to interfere 
with his scanning, he could follow the developments perfectly. 
There had been first one gigantic 
prominence, then two, which separated to opposite sides of its 
equator. Then two other prominences began to grow between 
them. 

For two full days, the new 
prominences grew, and then split, 



140 




 



so that the sun came to have the 
appearance of a ball of fire surrounded by a ring of blue-white 
incandescence. 

Then came instability. Flame 
geysers spouting hundreds of 
thousands of miles into emptiness 
ceased to keep their formation. 
They turned north and south 
from the equatorial line. The outline of the sun became irregular. 
It ceased to be round in profile, 
and even the appearance of a 
ring around it vanished. It looked — though this would never 
have occurred to Rhadampsicus 
— very much like a fiercely glowing gigantic potato. Its evolution 
of heat went up incredibly. It 
much more than doubled its rate 
of radiation. 

Rhadampsicus watched each 
detail of the flare-up with fascinated attention. Nodalictha dutifully watched with him. But she 
could not maintain her interest 
in so purely scientific a phenomenon. 

When a thin streamer of pure 
blue-white jetted upward from 
the sun's pole, attaining a speed 
of six hundred and ninety-two 
miles per second, Rhadampsicus 
turned to her with enthusiasm. 

"Exactly in the pattern of a 
flare-up according to Dhokis' 
theory!" he exclaimed. "I have 
always thought he was more nearly right thah the modernists. 
Radiation pressure can build up 



in a closed system such as the 
interior of a sun. It can equal the 
gravitational constant. And obviously it would break loose at 
the pole." 

Then he saw that Nodalictha's 
manner was one of distress. He 
was instantly concerned. 

"What's the matter, darling?" 
he asked anxiously. "I didn't 
mean to neglect you, my precious 
one!" 

Nodalictha did something that 
would have scared a human being 
out of a year's growth, but was 
actually the equivalent of an 
unhappy, stifled sob. 

"I am a beast!" said Rhadampsicus penitently. "I've kept you 
here, in boredom, while I enjoyed 
myself watching this sun do 
tricks. I'm truly sorry, Nodalictha. We will go on at once. I 
shouldn't have asked you to — " 

But Nodalictha said unhappily, 
"It isn't you, Rhadampsicus. It's 
me! While you've been watching 
the star, I've amused myself 
watching those quaint little creatures on the second planet. I've 
thought of them as — well, as 
pets. I've grown fond of them. It 
was absurd of me — " 

"Oh, but it is wonderful of 
you," said Rhadampsicus tenderly. "I love you all the more for 
it, my darling. But why are you 
unhappy about them? I made 
sure they had food and energy." 

"They're going to be burned 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



141 



up!" wailed Nodalictha, "and 
they're so cute!" 

Rhadampsicus blinked his eyes 
— all sixteen of them. Then he 
said self-accusingly, "My dear, 
I should have thought of that. 
Of course this is only a ftare-up, 
darling . . ." Then he made an 
impatient gesture. "I see! You 
would rather think of them as 
happy, in their little way, than as 
burned to tiny crisps." 

He considered, scanning the 
second planet with the normal 
anxiety of a bridegroom to do 
anything that would remove a 
cloud from his bride's lovely sixteen eyes. 

NIGHT fell on Cetopolis, and 
with it came some slight alleviation of the dreadfulness that 
had begun that afternoon. The 
air was furnacelike in heat and 
dryness. There was the smell of 
smoke everywhere. The -stars 
were faint and red and ominous, 
seen through the smoke that overlay everything. So far, to be sure, 
breathing was possible. It was 
even possible to be comfortable 
in an air-conditioned room. But 
this was only the beginning. 

Lon and Cathy sat together on 
the porch of his house, after sundown. The other colonists had 
gone away to their own homes. 
When the crack of " doom has 
visibly begun, men do queer 
things. In Cetopolis some un


doubtedly got drunk, or tried to. 
But there were farmers who 
would spend this last night looking at their , drooping crops, trying to persuade themselves that 
if Cetis Gamma only went back 
to normal before sunrise, the 
crops might yet be saved. But 
none of them expected it. 

Off to the south there was an 
angry reddish glare in the sky. 
That was vegetation on the desert there, burning. It grew thick 
as jungle in the rainy season, 
and dried out to pure dessication 
in dry weather. It had caught 
fire of itself from the sun's glare 
in late afternoon. Great clouds of 
acrid smoke rose from it to the 
stars. 

Beyond the horizon to the_west 
there was destruction. 

Lon and Cathy sat close together. She hadn't even asked to 
be taken back to Cetopolis, as 
convention would have required. 
The sun was growing hotter still 
while it sank below the horizon, 
It was expanding in fits and 
starts as new writhing spouts of 
stuff from its interior burst the 
bonds of gravity. Blazing magma 
flung upward in an unthinkable 
eruption. The sun had been three 
times normal size when it set. 

Lon was no astronomer, but 
plainly the end of life on the 
inner planets of Cetis Gamma 
was at hand. 

Cetis Gamma might, he con

sidered, be in the process of becoming a nova. Certainly beyond 
the horizon there was even more 
terrible heat than had struck the 
human colony before sundown. 
Even if the sun did not explode, 
even if it was only as fiercely 
blazing as at its setting, they 
would die within hours after sunrise. If it increased in brightness, 
by daybreak its first rays would 
be death itself. When dawn came, 
the very first direct beams would 
set the shiver trees alight on 
the hilltops, and as it rose the 
fires would go down into the valleys. This house would smoke and 
writhe and melt; the air would 
become flame, and the planet's 
surface would glow red-hot as it 
turned into the sunshine. 

"TT'S going to be— all right, 
-"- Lon," Cathy said unconvincedly. "It's just something 
happening that'll be over in a 
little while. But — in case it isn't 
— we might as well be together. 
Don't you think so?" 

Lon put his arm comfortingly 
around her. He felt a very strong 
impulse to lie. He could pretend 
to vast wisdom and tell her the 
sun's behavior was this or that, 
and never lasted more than a few 
v hours, but she'd know he lied. 
They could spend their last hours 
trying to deceive each other out 
of pure affection. But they'd 
know it was deceit. 



"D-don'r you think so?" insisted Cathy faintly. 

He said gently, "No, Cathy, 
and neither do you. This is the 
finish. It would've been a lot 
nicer to go on living, the two of 
us. We'd have had long, long 
years to be together. We'd have 
had kids, and they'd have grown 
up, and we'd have had— a lot of 
things. But now I'm afraid we 
won't." 

He tried to smile at her, but 
it hurt. He thought passionately 
that he would gladly submit himself to be burned in the slowest 
and most excruciating manner 
if only she could be saved from 
it. But he couldn't do anything. 

Cathy gulped. "I — I'm afraid 
so, too, Lon," she said in a small 
voice. "But it's nice we met each 
other, anyhow. Now we know we 
love each other. I don't like the 
idea of dying, but I'm glad we 
knew we loved each other before 
it happened." 

Lon's hands clenched fiercely. 
Then the rage went away. He 
said almost humorously, "Carson 
—he's back in Cetopolis. I wonder how he feels. He has no better 
chance than anybody else. Maybe he's sent off spacegrams, but 
no ship could possibly get here in 
time." 

Cathy shivered a little. "Let's 
not think about him. Just about 
us. We haven't much time." 

And just then, very strangely, 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



143 



an idea came to Lon Simpson. 
He tensed. 

After a moment, he said in a 
very queer voice, "This isn't a 
nova. It's a flare-up. The sun isn't 
exploding. It's just too hot, too 
big for the temperature inside it, 
and it's a closed system. So radiation pressure has been building 
up. Now it's got to be released. 
So it will spout geysers of its 
own substance. They'll go out 
over hundreds of thousands of 
miles. But in a couple of weeks 
it will be back — nearly — -to normal." 

He suddenly knew that. He 
knew why it was so. He could 
have explained it completely and 
precisely. But he didn't know how 
he knew. The items that added 
together were themselves so self 
evident that he didn't even wonder how he knew them. They had 
to be so! 

CATHY said muffledly, her 
face against his shoulder, 
"But we won't be alive in a 
couple of weeks, Lon. We can't 
live long past daybreak." 

He did not answer. There were 
more ideas coming into his mind. 
He didn't know where they came 
from. But again they were such 
self evident, unquestionable facts 
that he did not wonder about 
them. He simply paid tense, desperately concentrated attention 
as they formed themselves. 



"We — may live," he said shakily. "There's an ionosphere up at 
the top of the atmosphere here, 
just like there is on Earth. It's 
made by the sunlight ionizing the 
thin air. The — stronger sunlight 
will multiply the ionization. 
There'll be an — actually conducting layer of air . . . Yes . . . 
The air will become a conductor, 
up there." He wet his lips. "If I 
make a — gadget to — short-circuit 
that conducting layer to the 
ground here . . . When radiation 
photons penetrate a transparent 
conductor — but there aren't any 
transparent conductors — the photons will — follow the three-finger 
rule ... 

"They'll move at right angles 
to their former course — " 

He swallowed. Then he got up 
very quietly. He put her aside. 
He went to his tool shed. He 
climbed to the roof of the barn 
now filled with thanar leaves. He 
swung his axe. 

The barn was roofed with 
aluminum over malleable plastic. 
The useful property of malleable 
plastic is that it does not yield to 
steady pressure, but does yield 
to shock. It will stay in shape indefinitely under a load, but one 
can tap it easily into any form 
one desires. 

Lon swung his axe, head down. 
Presently he asked Cathy to 
climb up a ladder and hold a 
lantern for him. He didn't need " 



144 




 



light for the rough work — the 
burning desert vegetation gave 
enough for that. But when one 
wants to make a parabolic reflector by tapping with an axe, one 
needs light for the finer part of 
the job. 

TN Cetopolis, Carson agitatedly 
put his records on tape and 
sent it all off by spacegram. He'd 
previously reported on Lon Simpson, but now he knew that he was 
going to die. And he followed his 
instinct to transmit all his quite 
useless records, in order that his 
superiors might realize he had 
been an admirable employee. It 
did not occur to him that his superiors might be trying frantically to break his sending beam to 
demand that he find out how Lon 
Simpson made his power gadget 
and how he converted vegetation, 
before it was too late. They 
didn't succeed in breaking his 
beam, because Carson kept it 
busy. 

He was true to type. 

Elsewhere, other men were true 
to type, too. The human population of Cetis Gamma Two was 
very small. There were less than 
five thousand people on the planet — all within a hundred miles of 
Cetopolis, and all now on. the 
night side. The rest of the planet's land masses scorched and 
shriveled and burst into flame 
where the sun struck them. The 



few small oceans heated and 
their surfaces even boiled. But 
nobody saw it. The local fauna 
and flora died over the space of 
continents. 

But in the human settlement 
area, people acted according to 
their individual natures. Some 
few ran amok and tried to 
destroy everything — including 
themselves — before the blazing 
sun could return to do it. More 
sat in stunned silence, waiting 
for doom. A few dug desperately, 
trying to excavate caves or pits 
in which they or their wives or 
children could be safe . . . 

But Lon pounded at his barn 
roof. He made a roughly parabolic mirror some three yards 
across. He stripped off aluminum 
siding and made a connection 
with the ground. He poured 
water around that connection. 
He built a crude multiply twisted 
device of copper wire and put it 
in the focus of the parabolic 
mirror. 

He looked up at the sky. The 
stars seemed dimmer. He took 
the copper thing away, and they 
brightened a little. He carefully 
adjusted it until the stars were 
at their dimmest. 

He descended to the ground 
again. He felt an odd incredulity 
about what he'd done. He didn't 
doubt that it would work. He 
was simply unable to understand 
how he'd thought of it. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



145 



"rpHERE, darling! Your pets 
-■- are quite safe!" Rhadampsicus said pleasedly. 

Nodalictha scanned the second 
planet. It was apparently coated 
with a metallic covering. But it 
was not quite like metal. It was 
misty, like an unsubstantial barrier to light — and to Nodalictha's 
penetrating thoughts. 

"I had your male pet," Rhadampsicus explained tenderly, 
"set up a power beam link to the 
ionosphere. With several times 
the usual degree of ionization — 
because of the flaring sun — :the 
grounded ionosphere became a 
Rhinthak screen about the planet. 
The more active the sun, the 
more dense the screen. They'll 
have light to see by when their 
side of the planet is toward the 
sun, but no harmful radiation 
can get down to them. And the 
screen will fade away as the sun 
goes back to its normal state." 

Nodalictha rejoiced. Then she 
was a little distressed. 

"But now I can't watch them!" 
she pouted. Rhadampsicus watched her gravely. She said ruefully, 
"I see, Rhadampsicus. You've 
spoiled me! But if I can't watch 
them for the time being, I won't 
have anything to occupy me. 
Darling Rhadampsicus, you must 
talk to me sometimes!" 

He talked to her absorbedly. 
He seemed to think, however, that 
discussion of the local solar phe


nomena was conversation. With 
feminine guile, she pretended to 
be satisfied, but presently she 
went back to her housekeeping. 
She began to dream of their life 
when they had returned home, 
and of the residence they would 
inhabit there. Presently she was 
planning the parties she would 
give as a young matron, with 
canapes of krypton snow and zenon ice, with sprinklings of lovely 
red nickel bromide crystals for 
a garnish — 

r | iHE sun rose again, and they 
lived. It was as if the sky were 
covered with a thick cloud bank 
which absorbed the monstrous 
radiation of a sun now four times 
its previous diameter and madly 
changing shape like a monstrous 
ameba of flame. 

In time the sun set. It rose 
again. It set. And Cetis Gamma 
Two remained a living planet 
instead of being a scorched cinder. 

When four days had gone by 
and nobody died, the colonists 
decided that they might actually 
keep on living. They had at first 
no especially logical foundation 
for their belief. 

But Cathy boasted. And she 
boasted in Cetopolis. Since they 
were going to keep on living, the 
conventions required that she return to the planet's one human 
settlement and her duties as a 
beamphone operator. It wasn't 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



147 



proper for her to stay unchaperoned so long as she and Lon 
weren't married yet. 

She had no difficulty with Carson. He didn't refer to her desertion. Carson had his own 
troubles. Now that he had decided 
that he would live, his problems 
multiplied. The colonists' barns 
were rilled to capacity with thanar 
leaves which would pay off their 
debts to the Company. He began 
to worry about that. 
, Lost without the constant directives from the Company, he 
had his technicians step up the 
power in the settlement transmitter. He knew that the screen 
Lon had put up would stop ordinary spacegram transmission. 
Even with a tight beam,* he could 
broadcast and receive only at 
night, when the screen was thinnest. Even so, he had to search 
out holes in the screen. 

The system didn't work perfectly — it wasn't two-way at all, 
until the Company stepped up 
the power in its own transmitter 
— but spacegrams started to get 
through again. 

Carson smiled in relief. He began to regain some of his old 
arrogantly bored manner. Now 
that the Company's guiding hand 
was once more with him, nothing 
seemed as bad as it had been. He 
was able to report that •something 
had happened to save the colony 
from extinction, and that Lon 



Simpson had probably done it. 

In return, he got a spacegram 
demanding full particulars, and 
precise information on the devices he had reported Lon Simpson to have made. 

Humbly, Carson obeyed his 
corporation. 

TTE pumped Cathy- — which was 
not difficult, because she was 
bursting with pride in Lon. She 
confirmed, in detail, the rumor 
that Lon was somehow responsible for the protective screen 
that was keeping eyerybody alive. 

Carson sent the information by 
spacegram. He was informed that 
a special Company ship was 
heading for Cetis Gamma Two at 
full speed. Carson would take 
orders from its skipper when it 
arrived. Meanwhile, he would buy 
thanar leaf if absolutely necessary, but stall as long as possible. 
The legal staff of the Trading 
Company was working on the 
problem of adapting the system 
to get the new surplus supplies of 
thanar without letting anybody 
get anything in particular for it. 
He would keep secret the coming 
of the special ship, which was 
actually the space yacht of a 
member of the Board of Directors. 
And he would display great 
friendliness toward Lon Simpson. 

The last was the difficult part, 
because Lon Simpson was becoming difficult. With the sun 



148 




 



writhing as if in agony overhead 
— seen dimly through a permanent blessed mistiness — and 
changing shape from hour to 
hour, Lon Simpson had discovered something new to get mad 
about. Lon had felt definitely on 
top of the world. He had solved 
the problem of clearing his debts 
and getting credit sufficient for 
two passages back to Earth, with 
money there to take care of getting rich on his inventions. There 
was no reason to delay marriage. 
He wanted to get married. And 
through a deplorable oversight, 
there had been no method devised 
by which a legal marriage ceremony could be performed on 
Cetis Gamma Two. 

It was one of those accidental 
omissions which would presently 
be rectified. But the legal minds 
who'd set up the system for the 
planet had been thinking of money, not marriages. They hadn't 
envisioned connubial bliss as a 
service the Company should provide. And Lon was raising cain. 
His barn was literally bursting 
with thanar leaves, and he was 
filling up his attic, extra bedroom, 
living quarters and kitchen with 
"more. He was rich. He wanted to 
get married. And it wasn't possible. 

Lon was in a position to raise 
much more cain than ordinary. 
He'd made an amicable bargain 
with his fellow colonists. They 



brought truckloads of miscellaneous foliage to be put into his 
vegetation converter," and he converted it all into thanar leaves. 
The product was split two ways. 
Everybody was happy — except 
Carson — Because every colonist 
had already acquired enough 
thanar leaf to pay himself out of 
debt, and was working on extra 
capital. 

If this kept up, the galactic 
market would be broken. 

Carson had nightmares about 
that. 

CO the sun went through convulsions in emptiness, and nobody on its second planet paid 
any attention at all. After about 
a week, it occasionally subsided. 
When that happened, the ionization of the planet's upper atmosphere lessened, the radiation 
screen grew thinner, and a larger 
proportion of light reached the 
surface. When the sun flared 
higher, the shield automatically 
grew thicker. An astronomical 
phenomenon which should have 
destroyed all life on the inner 
planets came to be taken for 
granted. 

But events on the second planet were not without consequences 
elsewhere. The Board of Directors 
of the Cetis Gamma Trading 
Company simultaneously jittered 
and beamed with anticipation. If 
Lon could convert one form of 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



149 



vegetable product into another, 
then the Company's monopoly of 
thanar would vanish as soon as 
he got loose with his device. On 
the other hand, if the Company 
could get that device for its very 
own ... 

Thanar had a practically unlimited market. Every year a 
new age group of the population 
needed a milligram a day to keep 
old age away. But besides that, 
there - was Martian zuss fiber, 
which couldn't be marketed because there wasn't enough of it, 
but would easily fetch a thousand 
credits a kilo if Lon's gadget 
could produce it from samples. 
There was that Arcturian sicces 
dust — the pollen of an inordinately rare plant on Arcturus Four — 
which could be sold at more than 
its weight in diamonds, for perfume. And — 

The directors of the Company 
shivered over what might happen; and gloated over what 
could. So they kept their fingers 
crossed while the space yacht of 
one of their number sped toward 
Cetis Gamma Two, manned by 
very trustworthy men who would 
carry out their instructions with 
care and vigor and no nonsense 
about it. 

Lon Simpson worked with his 
neighbors, converting all sorts of 
vegetable debris — the ' fact that 
some of it was scorched did not 
seem to matter — into thanar leaf 



which was sound legal tender on .| 
that particular planet. From time ; 
to time he went to Cetopolis. He 
talked sentimentally and yearningly to Cathy. And then he went 
to Carson's office and raised the 
very devil because there was as 
yet no arrangement by which he 
and Cathy could enter into the 
state of holy matrimony. 

RHADAMPSICUS looked over 
his notes and was very well 
pleased. He explained to Nodalictha that from now on the return 
of Cetis Gamma to its normal 
condition would be a cut-anddried affair. He would like to 
stay and watch it, but the important phenomena were all over 
now. He said solicitously that if 
she wanted to go on, completing 
their nuptial journey . . . She 
might be anxious to see her family and friends . . . She might be 
lonely ... 

Nodalictha smiled at him. The 
process would have been horrifying to a human who watched, 
but Rhadampsicus smiled back. 

"Lonely?" asked Nodalictha 
coyly. "With you, Rhadampsicus?" 

He impulsively twined his eye 
stalks about hers. A little later 
he was saying tenderly, "Then 
I'll just finish my observations, 
darling, and we'll go on — since 
you don't mind waiting." 

"I'd like to see my pets again," 



150 




 



said Nodalictha, nestling comfortably against him. 

Together, they scanned the second planet, but their thoughts 
could not penetrate its Rhinthak 
screen. They saw the space yacht 
flash up to it. Rhadampsicus inspected the minds of the bipeds 
inside it. Nodalictha, of course, 
modestly refrained from entering 
the minds of male creatures other 
than her husband. 

"Peculiar," commented Rhadampsicus. "Very peculiar. If I 
were a sociologist, I might find it 
less baffling. But they must have 
a very queer sort of social system. They actually intend to 
harm your pets, Nodalictha, because the male now knows how 
to supply them all with food and 
energy! Isn't that strange? I 
wish the Rhinthak screen did not 
block off scanning ... But it 
will fade, presently." 

"You will keep the others from 
harming my pets," said Nodalictha confidently. "Do you know, 
darling, I think I must be quite 
the luckiest person in the Galaxy, 
to be married, to you." 

rwiHE space yacht landed at the 
•■- field outside Cetopolis. Inhabitants of the tiny town nocked 
to the field to see new faces. They 
were disappointed. One man came 
out and the airlock closed. No 
visitors. 

The skipper went into Carson's 



office. He closed the door firmly 
behind him. He had very beady 
eyes and a very hard-boiled expression. He looked at Carson 
with open contempt, and Carson 
felt that it was because Carson 
did the Company's dirty work 
with figures and due regard for 
law and order, instead of frankly 
and violently and without shillyshallying. 

"This Lon Simpson's got those 
gadgets, eh?" asked the skipper. 

"Why — yes," said Carson unhappily. "He's very popular at 
the moment. He made something 
on his barn roof that kept the sun 
from burning us all to death, you 
know — that still keeps us from 
burning to death, for that matter." 

"So if we take it away or smash 
it," observed the skipper, "we 
don't have to worry about anybody saying nasty things about 
us afterward. Yeah?" 

Carson swallowed. 

"Everybody' d die if you smashed the gadget," he admitted, "but 
all the thanar plants in existence 
would be burned up, too. There'd 
be no more thanar. The Company 
wouldn't like that." 

The skipper waved his hand. 
"How do I get this Simpson on 
my ship? Take a bunch of my 
men and go grab him?" 

"Wh-what are you going to do 
with him?" 

"Don't you worry," said the 



THE SENTIMENTALIST? 



151 



skipper comfortingly. "We know 
how to handle it. He knows how 
to make some things the bosses 
want to know how to make. Once 
I get him on the ship, he'll tell. 
We got ways. Do I take some men 
and grab him, or will you get him 
on board peaceable?" 

"There — ah — " Carson licked 
his lips. "He wants to get married. There's no provision in the 
legal code for it, as yet. It was 
overlooked. But I can tell him 
that as a ship captain, you — " 

The skipper nodded matter of 
factly. 

"Right. You get him and the 
girl on board. And I've got some 
orders for you. Gather up plenty 
of thanar seed. Get some starting 
trays with young plants in them. 
I'll come back in a couple of 
days and take you and them on 
board. The stuff this guy has got 
is too good, understand?" 

"N-no. I'm afraid I don't." 

I GET this guy to tell us how 
to make his gadgets," the 
skipper explained contemptuously. "We make sure he tells us 
right. To be extra sure, we leave 
the gadgets he's got made and 
working back here, where he can't 
get to 'em and spoil 'em. But 
when we know all he knows — and 
what he only guesses, ■ too, and 
my tame scientists have made 
the same kinda gadgets, an' they 
work — why, we come back and 



pick you up, and the thanar seed 
and the young growing plants. 
Then we get the gadgets this guy 
made here, and we head back for 
Earth." 

"But if you take the gadget 
that keeps us all from being 
burned up — " Carson said agitatedly, "if you do, everybody 
here — " 

"Won't that be too bad!" the 
skipper said ironically. "But you 
won't be here. You'll be on the 
yacht. Don't worry. Now go fix 
it for the girl and him to walk 
into our parlor." 

Carson's hand shook as he 
reached for the beamphone. His 
voice was not quite normal as he 
explained to Cathy in the exchange that the skipper of the 
space yacht had the legal power 
to perform marriage ceremonies 
in space. And Carson, as a gesture 
of friendship to one of the most 
prominent colonists, had asked if 
the captain would oblige Cathy 
and Lon. The captain had agreed. 
If they made haste, he would 
take them out in space and marry 
them. 

The skipper of the space yacht 
regarded him with undisguised 
scorn when he hung up the phone 
and mopped his face. 

"Pretty girl, eh?" he asked contemptuously, "and you didn't 
have the nerve to grab her for 
yourself?" He did not wait for 
an answer. "I'll look her over. 



152 




 



You get your stuff ready for 
when I come back in a couple of 
days." 

"But — when you release them," 
Carson said shakily, "They'll report — " 

The skipper looked at Carson 
without any expression at all. 
Then he went out. 

Carson felt sick. But he was a 
very loyal employee of the Cetis 
Gamma Trading Company. 
From the windows of his air-conditioned office, he watched Lon 
Simpson greet Cathy on his arrival in Cetopolis. He saw Cathy 
put a sprig of chanel blossoms on 
the lapel of her very best suit, in 
lieu of a bridal bouquet. And he 
watched them go with shining 
faces toward the airport. He 
didn't try to stop them. 

Later he heard the space yacht 
take off. 

lyrODALICTHA prepared to 
^ share the thoughts and the 
happiness of the female biped 
whose emotions were familiar, 
since Nodalictha was so recently 
a bride herself. Rhadampsicus 
was making notes, but he gallantly ceased when Nodalictha 
called to him. They sat, then, before their crude but comfortable 
bower on the ninth planet, all set 
to share the quaint rejoicing of 
the creatures of which Nodalictha had grown fond. 

Nodalictha penetrated the 



thoughts of the female, in pleased 
anticipation. Rhadampsicus scanned the mind of the male, and his 
expression changed. He shifted 
his thought to another and another of the bipeds in the ship's 
company. He spoke with some 
distaste. 

"The ones you consider your 
pets, Nodalictha, are amiable 
enough. But the others — " He 
frowned. "Really, darling, if you 
went into their minds, you'd be 
most displeased. They are quite 
repulsive. Let's forget about them 
and start for home. If you really 
care for pets, we've much more 
suitable creatures there." 

Nodalictha pouted. 

"Rhadampsicus, let's just 
watch their marriage ceremony. 
It is so cute to think of little creatures like that loving each other 
— and marrying — " 

Rhadampsicus withdrew his 
thought from the space yacht and 
looked about the charming rural 
retreat he and Nodalictha had 
occupied. Its nitrogen-snow walls 
glittered in the starlight. The garden of cyanogen flowers and the 
border of ammonia crystals and 
the walkway of monoclinic sulphur, and the reflection pool of 
liquid hydrogen he'd installed in 
an odd half hour. These were 
simple, but they were delightful. 
The crudity of the space yacht 
with its. metal walls so curiously 
covered over with a coating of 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



153 



lead oxide in hardened oil, and 
the vegetable gum flooring . . . 
Rhadampsicus did not like the 
surroundings men made for themselves in space. 

"Very well, darling," he said 
resignedly. "We will watch, and 
then we'll take off for home. I'm 
anxious to see what the modernists have to say when I show 
them my notes on this flare-up. 
— And of course," he added with 
grave humor, "you want to show 
your family that I haven't illtreated you." 

He was the barest trace impatient, but Nodalictha's thoughts 
were with the female biped in the 
spaceship. Her expression was 
distressed. 

"Rhadampsicus!" she said angrily. "The other bipeds are being unkind to my pets! Do 
something! I don't like them!" 

A SAILOR in a soiled uniform 
led them into the space 
yacht's saloon. The airlock clanked shut, and the yacht soared for 
the skies. The sailor vanished. 
Nobody else came near. Then 
Lon stiffened. He got the flavor 
of his surroundings. He had 
Cathy with him. On her account, 
his flesh crawled suddenly. 

This was a space yacht, but of 
a very special kind. It was a 
pleasure ship. The decorations 
were subtly disgusting. There 
were pictures on the walls, and 



at first glance they were pretty 
enough, but on second glance 
they were disquieting, and when 
carefully examined they were 
elaborately and allusively monstrous. This was the yacht of 
someone denying that anything 
could be more desirable than 
pleasure — and who took his pleasure in a most unattractive fashion. 

Lon grasped this much, and it 
occurred to him that the crew of 
such a yacht would be chosen for 
its willingness to cooperate in its 
owner's enterprises. And Lon 
went somewhat pale, for Cathy 
was with him. 

The ship went up and up, with 
the dark shutters over the ports 
showing that it was in sunshine 
fierce enough to be dangerous on 
unshielded flesh. Presently there 
was the feel of maneuvering. After a time the shutters flipped 
open and stars were visible. 

Lon went quickly to a port and 
looked out. The great black mass 
of the night side of Cetis Gamma 
Two filled half the firmament. It 
blotted out the sun. The space 
yacht might be two or three thousand miles up and in the planet's 
umbra — its shadow — which was 
not necessary for a space wedding, or for anything involving a 
reasonably brief stay in the excessive heat Cetis Gamma gave 
off. 

There were clankings. A door 



154 




 



opened. The skipper came in and 
Cathy smiled at him because she 
didn't realize Lon's fierce apprehension. Four other men followed, 
all in soiled and untidy space 
yacht uniforms, then two other 
men in more ordinary clothing. 
Their expressions were distinctly 
uneasy. 

The four sailors walked matter 
of factly over to Lon and grabbed 
at him. They should have taken 
him completely by surprise, but 
he had been warned just enough 
to explode into battle. It was a 
very pretty fight, for a time. Lon 
kept three of them busy. One 
snarled with a wrenched wrist, 
another spat blood and teeth and 
a third had a closed eye before 
the fourth swung a chair. Then 
Lon hit something with his head. 
It was the deck, but he didn't 
know it. 

IW/'HEN he came to, he was 
™* hobbled. He was not bound 
so he couldn't move, but his 
hands were handcuffed together, 
with six inches of chain between 
for play. His ankles were similarly restricted. He could move, 
but he could not fight. Blood was 
trickling down his temple and 
somebody was holding his head 
up. 

The skipper said impatiently, 
"All right, stand back." 

Lon's head was released. The 
skipper jerked a thumb. Men 



went out. Lon looked about desperately for "Cathy. She was there 
— dead white and terrified, but 
apparently unharmed. She stared 
at Lon in wordless pleading. 

"You're a suspicious guy, 
aren't you?" asked the skipper 
sardonically. "Somebody lays a 
finger on you and you start fighting. But you've got the idea. I'll 
say it plain so we can get moving. You're Lon Simpson. Carson, down on the planet, reported 
some nice news about you. You 
made a gadget that converts any 
sort of leaf to thanar. Maybe it 
turns stuff to other stuff, too." He 
paused. "We want to know how 
to make gadgets like that. You're 
gonna draw plans an' explain the 
theory. I got guys here to listen. 
We're gonna make one, from your 
plans an' explanations, an' it'd 
better work. See?" 

"Carson sent for you to do 
this," Lon Simpson said thickly. 

"He did. The Company wants 
it. They'll use it to make zuss 
fiber and sicces dust, and stuff 
like that. Maybe dream dust, too, 
an' so on. The point is you're 
gonna tell us how to make those 
gadgets. How about it?" 

Lon licked his lips. He said 
slowly, "I think there's more. Go 
on." 

"You made another gadget," 
said the skipper, with relish, 
"that turns out power without 
fuel. The Company wants that, 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



155 



too. Spacelines will pay for it. 
Cities will pay for it. It ought 
to be a pretty nice thing. You're 
gonna make plans and explanations of how that works and we're 
gonna make sure they're right. 
That clear?" 

"Will you let us go when I've 
told you?" Lon asked bitterly. 

"Not without one more gadget," the skipper added amiably. 
"You made something that put a 
screen around the planet yonder, 
so it didn't get burned up. It'd 
oughta be useful. The company 
'11 put one around Mercury. 
Convenient for minin' operations. 
One around that planet that's too 
close to Sirius. Oh, there's plenty 
of places that'll be useful. So 
you'll get set to draw up the 
plans for that, too — and explanations of how it works. Then we'll 
talk about lettin' you go." 

T ON knew that he wouldn't be 
let go in any case. Not after 
he'd told them what was wanted. 
Not by men who'd work on a 
pleasure craft like this. Not* with 
Cathy a prisoner with him. But 
he might as well get all the cards 
down. 

"And if I won't tell you what 
you want to know?" he asked. 

The skipper shrugged his 
shoulders. "You were knocked 
out a while," he said without 
heat. "While we were waitin' for 
you to come to, we told her — " 



he jerked his thumb at Cathy — 
"what would happen to her if 
you weren't obligin'. We told her 
plenty. She knows we mean it. 
We won't hurt you until we've 
finished with her. So you'd better 
get set to talk. I'll let her see if 
she can persuade you peaceable. 
I'll give her ten minutes." 

He went out. The door clicked 
shut behind him and Lon knew 
that this was the finish. He looked 
at Cathy's dazed, horror-filled 
eyes. He knew this wasn't a bluff. 
He was up against the same system that had brought colonists to 
Certs Gamma, Two. The brains 
that had planned that system had 
planned this. They'd gotten completely qualified men to do their 
dirty work in both cases. 

"Lon, darling! Please kill me!" 
Cathy said in a hoarse whisper. 

He looked at her in astonishment. 

"Please kill me!" repeated 
Cathy desperately. "They — they 
can't ever dare let us go, Lon, 
after what they've told me! 
They've got to kill us both. But 
— Lon, darling — please kill me 
first ..." 

An idea came into Lon's mind. 
He surveyed it worriedly. He 
knew that he would have to tell 
what he knew and then he would 
be killed. The Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company wanted his inventions, and it would need him 
dead after it had them. 



156 




 



The idea was hopeless, but he 
had to try it. They knew he'd 
made gadgets which did remarkable things. If he made something 
now and persuaded them that it 
was a weapon . . . 

His flesh crawled with horror. 
Not for himself, but for Cathy. 
He fumbled in his. pockets. A 
pocket knife. A key chain. String. 
His face was completely gray. He 
ripped an upholstered seat. There 
were coiled springs under the 
foamite. He pulled away a piece 
of decorative molding. He knew 
it wouldn't work, but there wasn't 
anything else to do. His hands 
moved awkwardly, with the 
handcuffs limiting their movements. 

Time passed. He had something finished. It was a bit of 
wood with a coil spring from the 
chair, with his key chain wrapped 
around it and his pocket knife 
set in it so that the blade would 
seem to make a contact. But it 
would achieve nothing whatever. 

Cathy stared at him. Her eyes 
were desperate, but she believed. 
She'd seen three equally improbable devices perform wonders. 
While Lon made something that 
looked like the nightmare of an 
ultimatist sculptor, she watched 
in terrified hope. 

TTE HAD it in his hand when 
the door opened again and 
the skipper came back into the 



saloon. He said prosaically, "Shall 
I call in the scientist guys to listen, or the persuader guys to work 
on her?" 

"Neither. I've made another 
gadget," Lon said from a dry 
throat. "It will kill you. It'll kill 
everybody on the ship — from 
here. You're going to put us back 
down on the planet below." 

The skipper did not look at the 
gadget, but at Lon's face. Then 
he called. The fouj, men of the 
crew and the two uneasy scientists came in. 

"We got to persuade," the skipper said sardonically. "He just 
told me he's made a new gadget 
that'll kill us all." 

He moved unhurriedly toward 
Lon. Lon knew that his bluff was 
no good. If the thing had actually been a weapon, he'd have 
been confident and assured. He 
didn't feel that way, but he raised 
the thing menacingly as the skipper approached. 

The skipper took it away, 
laughing. 

"We'll tie him in a chair an' 
get to work on her. When he's 
ready to talk, we'll stop." He 
looked at the object in his hands. 
It was ridiculous to look at. It 
was as absurd as the device that 
extracted power from matter 
stresses, and the machine that 
converted one kind of vegetation 
into another, and the apparatus — 
partly barn roof — that had short 


THE SENTIMENTALISTS

cuited the ionosphere of Cetis 
Gamma Two to the planet's solid 
surface. It looked very foolish indeed. 

The skipper was amused. 

"Look out, you fellas," he said 
humorously. "It's gonna kill 
you!" 

He crooked his finger and the 
knifeblade made a contact. He 
swept it in mock menace about 
the saloon. The four crew-members and the two scientists went 
stiff. He gaped at them, then 
turned the device to stare at it 
incredulously. He came within its 
range. 

He stiffened. Off-balance, he 
fell on the device, breaking its 
gimcrack fastenings and the contact which transmitted nothing 
that Lon Simpson could imagine 
coming out of it. The others fell, 
one by one, with peculiarly solid 
impacts. 

Their flesh was incredibly hard. 
It was as solid, in fact, as so 
much mahogany. 

TVTODALICTHA said warmly, 
^- ' "You're a darling, Rhadampsicus! It was outrageous of those 
nasty creatures to intend to harm 
my pets! I'm glad you attended 
to them!" 

"And I'm glad you're pleased, 
my dear," Rhadampsicus said 
pleasantly. "Now shall we set out 
for home?" 

Nodalictha looked about the 



cosy landscape of the ninth planet 
of Cetis Gamma. There were jagged peaks of frozen air, and 
mountain ranges of water, solidified ten thousand aeons ago. 
There were frost-trees of nitrogen, the elaborate crystal formations of argon, and here a wide 
sweep of oxygen crystal sward, 
with tiny peeping wild crystals 
of deep-blue cyanogen seeming to 
grow more thickly by the brook 
of liquid hydrogen. And there was 
their bower; primitive, but the 
scene of a true honeymoon idyll. 

"I almost hate to go home, 
Rhadampsicus," Nodalictha said. 
"We've been so happy here. Will 
you remember it for always?" 

"Naturally," said Rhadampsicus. "I'm glad you've been happy-" 

Nodalictha snuggled up to him 
and twined eye stalks with him. 

"Darling," she said softly, 
"you've been wonderful, and I've 
been spoiled, and you've let me 
be. But I'm going to be a very 
dutiful wife from now on, Rhadampsicus. Only jt has been fun, 
having you be so nice to me!" 

"It's been fun for me, too," 
replied Rhadampsicus gallantly. 

Nodalictha took a last glance 
around, and each of her sixteen 
eyes glowed sentimentally. Then 
she scanned the far-distant spaceship in the shadow of the second 
planet from the now subsiding 
sun. 



158 




 



"My pets," she said tenderly. 
"But — Rhadampsicus, what are 
they doing?" 

"They've discovered that the 
crew of their vehicle — they call it 
a space yacht— aren't dead, that 
they're only in suspended animation. And they've decided in some , 
uneasiness that they'd better take 
them back to Earth to be revived." 

"How nice! I knew they were 
sweet little creatures!" 

Rhadampsicus hesitated a moment. 

"From the male's mind I gather 
something else. Since the crew of 
this space yacht was incapacitated, and they were — ah — not 
employed on it, he and your fe^ 
male will bring it safely to port, 
and, I gather that they have a 
claim to great reward. Ah — it is 
something they call 'salvage.' He 
plans to use it to secure other 
rewards he calls 'patents' and 
they expect to live happily ever 
after." 

"And," cried Nodalictha gleefully, "from the female's mind I 
know that she is very proud of 
him, because she doesn't know 
that you designed all the instruments he made, darling. She's 
speaking to him now, telling him 
she loves him very dearly." 

Then Nodalictha blushed a little, because in a faraway space 
yacht Cathy had kissed Lon 
Simpson. The process seemed 



highly indecorous to Nodalictha, 
so recently a bride. 

"Yes," said Rhadampsicus, drily. "He is returning the compliment. It is quaint to think of 
such small creatures — Ha! Nodalictha, you should be pleased 
again. He is telling her that they 
will be married when they reach 
Earth, and that she shall have a 
white dress and a veil and a train. 
But I am afraid we cannot follow to witness the ceremony." 

Their tentacles linked and their 
positron blasts mingling, the two 
of them soared up from the surface of the ninth planet of Cetis 
Gamma. They swept away, headed for their home at the extreme 
outer tip of the most far-flung 
arm of the spiral outposts of the 
Galaxy. 

"But still," said Nodalictha, as 
they swept through emptiness at 
a speed unimaginable to humans, 
"they're wonderfully cute." 

"Yes, darling," Rhadampsicus 
agreed, unwilling to start an argument so soon after the wedding. "But not as cute as you." 

|~|N THE space yacht, Lon 
Simpson tried to use his genius to invent a way to get his 
handcuffs and leg-irons off. He 
failed completely. 

Cathy had to get the keys out 
of the skipper's pocket and unlock 
them for him.
