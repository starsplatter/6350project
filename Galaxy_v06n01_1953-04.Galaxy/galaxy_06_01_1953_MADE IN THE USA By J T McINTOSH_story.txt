MADE IN THE U.S.A. By J. T. McINTOSH 

NOT a soul watched as 
Roderick Liffcom carried his bride across the 
threshold. They were just a couple of nice, good-looking kids 
Roderick a psychologist and Alison an ex-copy-writer. They 
weren't news yet. There was 
nothing to hint that in a few 
days the name of Liffcom would 
be known to almost everyone in 
the world, the tag on a case 
which interested everybody. Not 
everyone would follow a murder 
case, a graft case, or an espionage 
case. But everyone would follow 
the Liffcom case. 

Let's have a good look at them 
while we have the chance, before 
the mobs surround them. Roderick was big and strong enough 
to treat his wife's 115 pounds 
with contempt, but there was no 
contempt in the way he held her. 
He carried her as if she were a 
million dollars in small bills and 
there was a strong wind blowing. 
He looked down at her with his 
heart in his eyes. He had black 
hair and brown eyes and one 
could see at a glance that he could 
have carried any girl he liked over 
the threshold. 

Alison nestled in his arms like 
a kitten, eyes half -closed with 
rapture, arms about his neck. 
She was blonde and had fantastically beautiful eyes, not to mention the considerable claims to 
notice of her other features. But 
even at first glance one would 
know that there was more to Alison than beauty. It might be 
brains, or courage, or hard, bitter 
experience that had tempered her 
keen as steel. One could see at a 
glance that she could have been 
carried over the threshold by 
any man she liked. 



As they went in, it was the end 
of a story. But let's be different 
and call it the beginning. 

TN the morning, when they were 
-* - at breakfast on the terrace, 
the picture hadn't changed radically. That is, Roderick was 
rather different, blue-chinned and 
sleepy-eyed and in a brown 
flannel bathrobe, and Alison was 
more spectacularly different in 
a pale green negligee that wasn't 
so much worn as wafted about. 
But the way they looked at each 
other hadn't changed remotely — 
then. 

"There's something," remarked 
Alison casually, tracing patterns 
on the damask tablecloth with 
one slim finger, "that perhaps I 
ought to tell you." 

Two minutes later they were 
fighting for the phone. 

"I want to call my lawyer," 
Roderick bellowed. 

"I want to call my lawyer," 
Alison retorted. 

He paused, the number half 
dialed. "You can't," he told her 
roughly. "It's the same lawyer." 

She recovered herself first, as 
she always had. She smiled sunnily. "Shall we toss a coin for 
him?" she suggested. 

"No," said Roderick brutally. 
Where, oh, where was his great 
blinding love? "He's mine. I pay 
him more than you ever could." 

"Right," agreed Alison. "I'll

G A L A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



fight the case myself." 

"So will I," Roderick exclaimed, and slammed the receiver 
down. Instantly he picked it up 
again. "No, we'll need him to get 
things moving." 

"Collusion?" asked Alison 
sweetly. 

"It was a low, mean, stinking, 
dirty, cattish, obscene, disgusting, filthy-minded thing to wait 
until . . ." 

"Until what?" Alison asked 
with more innocence than one 
would have thought there was 
in the world. 

"Android!" he spat viciously at 
her. 

Despite herself, her eyes flashed 
with anger. 

II 

THE newspapers not only mentioned it, they said it at the 
top of their voices: human sues 

ANDROID FOR DIVORCE. It wasn't 

much of a headline, for one naturally wondered why a human 
suing an android for divorce 
should rate a front-page story. 
After all, half the population of 
the world was android. Every 
day humans divorced humans, 
humans androids, androids humans, and androids androids. 
The natural reaction to a headline like that was: "So what? 
Who cares?" 

But it didn't need particular 



intelligence to realize that there 
must be something rather special 
about this case. 

The report ran: "Everton, 
Tuesday. History is made today 
in the first human vs. android 
divorce case since the recent 
grant of full legal equality to 
androids. It is also the first case 
of a divorce sought on the 
grounds that one contracting 
party did not know the other was 
an android. This became possible only because the equality 
law made it no longer obligatory 
to disclose android origin in any 
contract. 

"Recognizing the importance of 
this test case, certain to affect 
millions in the future, Twentyfour Hours will cover the case, 
which opens on Friday, in meticulous detail. Ace reporters 
Anona Geier and Walter Hallsmith will bring to our readers 
the whole story of this historic 
trial. Grier is human and Hallsmith android . . ." 

The report went on to give 
such details as the names of the 
people in this important test case, 
and remarked incidentally that 
although the Liffcom marriage 
had lasted, only ten hours and 
thirteen minutes before the divorce plea was entered, there had * 
been even briefer marriages recorded. 

Twenty-four Hours thus 
adroitly obviated thousands of

letters asking breathlessly: "Is 
this a record?" 

Ill 

A LISON, back at her bachelor 
flat, stretched herself on a 
divan, focused her eyes past the 
ceiling on infinity, and thought 
and thought and thought. 

She wasn't ^particularly unhappy. Not for Alison were misery and resentment and wild, 
impossible hope. She met the 
tragedy of her life *with placid 
resignation and even humor. 

"Let's face it," she told herself 
firmly, "I'm hurt. I hoped he'd 
say, 'It doesn't matter. What 
difference could that make? It's 
you I love' — the sort of thing 
men say in love stories. But what 
did he say? Dirty android." 

Oh, well. Life wasn't like love 
stories or they wouldn't just be 
stories. 

She might as well admit for a 
start that she still loved him. 
That would clarify her feelings. 

She should have told him 
earlier that she was an android. 
Perhaps he had some excuse for 
believing she merely waited until non-consummation was no 
longer grounds for divorce, and 
then triumphantly threw the fact 
that she was an android in his 
lap. (But what good was that 
supposed to do her?) 

It wasn't like that at all, of 



course. She hadn't told him because they had to get to know 
each other before the question 
arose. One didn't say the moment one was introduced to a 
person: "I'm married," or "I 
once served five years for theft," 
or "I'm an android. Are you?" 

If in the first few weeks she 
had known Roderick, some remark had been made about androids, she'd have remarked that 
she was one herself. But it never 
had. 

When he asked her to marry 
him, she honestly didn't think of 
saying she was an android. There 
were times when it mattered and 
times when it didn't; this seemed 
to be one of the latter. Roderick 
was so intelligent, so liberalminded, and so easygoing (excepf. 
when he lost his temper) that 
she didn't think he would care. 

It never did occur to her that 
he might care. She just mentioned it, as one might say: "I 
hope you don't mind my drinking iced coffee every morning." 
Well, almost. She just mentioned 
it . . . 

And happiness was over. 

Now an idea was growing in 
the sad ripple of her thoughts. 
Did Roderick really want this 
divorce case, after all, or was he 
only trying to prove something? 
Because if he was, she was ready 
to admit cheerfully that it was 
proved. 



8 




 



She wanted Roderick. She 'didn't quite understand what had 
happened — perhaps he would 
take her back on condition that 
he could trample on her face 
first. If so, that was all right. 
She was prepared to let him swear 
at her and rage at androids and 
work off any prejudice and hate 
he might have accumulated 
somehow, somewhere — as long as 
he took her back. 

SHE reached behind her, picked up the telephone and 
dialed Roderick's number. 

"Hello, Roderick," she said 
cheerfully. "This is Alison. No, 
don't hang up. Tell me, why do 
you hate androids?" 

There was such a long silence 
that she knew he was considering 
everything, including the advisability of hanging up without a 
word. It could be said of Roderick that he thought things 
through very carefully before going off half-cocked. 

"I don't -hate androids," he 
barked at last. 

"You've got something against 
android girls, then?" 

"No!" he shouted. "I'm a psychologist. I think comparatively 
straight. I'm not fouled up with 
race hatred and prejudice and 
megalomania and — " 

"Then," said Alison very quietly, "it's just one particular android girl you hate." 



Roderick's voice was suddenly 
quiet, too. "No, Alison. It has 
nothing to do with that. It's just 
. . . children." 

So that was it. Alison's eyes 
filled with tears. That was the 
one thing she could do nothing 
about, the thing she had refused 
even to consider. 

"You really mean it?" she 
asked. "That's not just the case 
you're going to make out?" 

"It's the case I'm going to 
make out," he replied, "and I 
mean it. Trouble is, Alison, you 
hit something you couldn't have 
figured on. Most people want 
children, but are resigned to the 
fact that they're not likely to 
get them. I was one of a family 
of eight. The youngest. You'd 
have thought, wouldn't you, that 
that line was pretty safe? 

"Well, all the others are married. Some have been for a long 
time. One brother and two sisters 
have been married twice. That 
makes a total of seventeen human 
beings, not counting me. And 
their net achievement in the way 
of reproduction is zero. 

"It's a question of family continuity, don't you see? I don't 
think we'djnind if there was one 
child among the lot of us — one 
extension into the future. But 
there isn't, and there's only this 
chance left." 

Alison dropped as close to 
misery as she ever did. She un


MADE IN U.S.A.

derstood every word ' Roderick 
said and what was behind every 
word. If she ever had a chance 
of having children, she wouldn't 
give it up for one individual or 
love of one individual, either. 

But then, of course, she never 
had it. 

In the silence, Roderick hung 
up. Alison looked down at her 
own beautiful body and for once 
couldn't draw a shadow of complacency or content from looking 
at it. Instead, it irritated her, for 
it would never produce a child. 
What was the use of all the appearance, all the mechanism of 
sex, without its one real function? 

But it never occurred to her to 
give up, to let the suit go undefended. There must be something she could do^ some line 
she could take. Winning the case 
was nothing, except that that 
might be a tiny, unimportant 
part of winning back Roderick. 

IV 

THE judge was a little pompous, and it was obvious from 
the start that under the very considerable power he had under the 
contract-court system, he meant 
to run this case in his own way 
and enjoy it. 

He clasped his hands on the 
bench and looked around the 
packed courtroom happily. He 
made his introductory remarks 



with obvious intense satisfaction 
that at least fifty reporters were 
writing down every word. 

"This has been called an important case," he said, "and it is. 
I could tell you why it is important, but that would not be 
justice. Our starting point must 
be this." He wagged his head in 
solemn glee at the jury. "We 
know nothing." 

He liked that. He said it again. 
"We know nothing. We don't 
know the factors involved. We 
have never heard of androids. 
All this and more, we have to be 
told. We can call on anyone anywhere for evidence. And we must 
make up our minds here and 
now, on what we are told here 
and now, on the rights and 
wrongs of this case — and on nothing else." 

He had stated his theme and 
he developed it. He swooped and 
soared; he shot away out of 
sight and returned like a swift 
raven to cast pearls before swine. 
For, of course, his audience was 
composed of swine. He didn't say 
so or drop the smallest hint to 
that effect, but it wasn't necessary. Only on Roderick and Alison did he cast a fatherly, 
friendly eye. They had given him 
his hour .of glory. They weren't 
swine. 

But Judge Collier was no fool. 
Before he had lost the interest he 
had created, he was back in the 



10 




 



ourtroom, getting things moving. 

"I understand," he said, glancig from Alison to Roderick and 
then back at Alison, which was 
understandable, "that you are 
conducting your own cases. That 
will be a factor tending toward 
informality, which is all to the' 
good. First of all, will you look 
at the jury?" 

Everyone in court looked at 
the jury. The jury looked at each 
other. In accordance with contract-court procedure, Roderick 
and Alison faced each other 
across the room, with the jury 
behind Alison so that they could 
see Roderick full-face and Alison 
in profile, and would know when 
they were lying. 

"Alison Liffcom," said the 
judge, "have you any objection 
to any member of the jury?" 

Alison studied them. They 
were people, no more, no less. 
Careful police surveys produced 
juries that were as near genuine 
random groups as could reasonably be found. 

"No," she said. 

"Roderick Liffcom. Have you 
any objection — " 

"Yes," said Roderick belligerently. "I want to know how 
many of them are androids." 

There was a stir of interest in 
the court. 

So it was really to be a human android battle. 



JUDGE Collier's expression did 
not change. "Out of order," 
he said. "Humans and androids 
are equal at law, and you cannot 
object to any juror because he 
is an android." 

"But this case concerns the 
rights of humans and androids," 
Roderick protested. 

"It concerns nothing of the 
kind," replied the judge sternly, 
"and if your plea is along those 
lines, we may as well forget the 
whole thing and go home. You 
cannot divorce your wife because 
she is an android." 

"But she didn't tell me — " 
"Nor because she didn't tell 
you. No android now is obliged, 
ever, to disclose — " 

"I know all that," said Roderick, exasperated. "Must I state 
the obvious? I never had much 
to do with the law, but I do 
know this — the fact that A equals 
B may cut no ic^, while the fact 
that B equals A may sew the 
whole case up. Okay, I'll state 
the obvious. I seek divorce on 
the grounds that Alison concealed from me until after our marriage her inability to have a 
child." 

It' was the obvious plea, but 
it was still a surprise to some 
people. There was a murmur of 
interest. Now things could move. 
There was something to argue 
about. 

Alison watched Roderick and 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



11 



smiled at the thought that she 
knew him much better than anyone else in the courtroom did. 
Calm, he was dangerous, and he 
was fighting to be calm. And as 
she looked steadily at him, part 
of her was wondering how she 
could upset him and put him off 
stroke, while the other part was 
praying that he would be able to 
control himself and show up well. 

She was asked to take the . 
stand and she did it absently, 
still thinking about Roderick. 
Yes, she contested the divorce. 
No, she didn't deny that the facts 
were as stated. On what grounds 
did she contest the case, then? 

She brought her attention back 
to the matter in hand. "Oh, that's 
very simple. I can put it in — " 
she counted on her fingers — -"nine 
words. How do we know I can't 
have a child?" 

Reporters wrote down the word 
"sensation." It wouldn't have 
lasted, but Alison knew that. She 
piled on more fuel. 

"I'm not stating my whole 
case," she said. "All I'm saying 
at the moment is . . ." She 
blushed. She felt it on her face 
and was pleased with herself. 
She hadn't been sure she could 
do it. "I don't like to speak of 
such things, but I suppose I must. 
When I married Roderick, I was 
a virgin. How could I possibly 
know then that I couldn't have 
a baby?" 



V 

IT took a long- time to get 
things back to normal after 
that. The judge had to exhaust 
himself hammering with his 
gavel and threatening to clear 
the court. But Alison caught 
Roderick's eye, and he grinned 
and shook his head slowly. Roderick was two people, at least. 
He was the hothead, quick to 
anger, impulsive, emotional. But 
he was also, though it was hard 
to believe sometimes, a psychologist, able to sift and weigh and 
classify things and decide what 
they meant. 

She knew what he meant as 
he shook his head at her. She 
had made a purely artificial 
point, effective only for the moment. She knew she was an android and that androids didn't 
have children. The rest was irrelevant. 

"We have now established;" 
the judge was saying, breathless 
from shouting and banging with 
his gavel, "what the case is about 
and some of the facts. Alison 
Liffcom admits that she concealed the fact that she was an 
android, as she was perfectly entitled to do — " He frowned down 
at Roderick, who had risen. 
"Well?" 

Roderick, at the moment, was 
the psychologist. "You mentioned > the word 'android,' Judge. 



12 




 



Have you forgotten that none of 
us knows what an android is? 
You said, I believe: 'We have 
never heard of androids.' " 

Judge Collier clearly preferred 
the other Roderick, whom he 
could squash when he liked. 
"Precisely," he said without enthusiasm. "Do you propose to 
I tell us?" 

"I propose to have you told," 
said Roderick. ~ 

Dr. Geller took the stand. 
Roderick faced him, looking 
calm and competent. Most of the 
audience were women. He knew 
how to make the most of himself, and he did. Dr. Geller, silver-haired, dignified, was as 
impassive as a statue. 

"Who are you, Doctor?" asked 
Roderick coolly. 

"I am director of the Everton 
Creche, where the androids for 
the entire state are made." 

"You know quite a bit about 
androids?" 

"I do." 

"Just incidentally, in case anyone would like to know, do you 
mind telling us whether you are 
human or android?" 

"Not at all. I am an android." 

"I see. Now perhaps you'll tell 
us what androids are, when they 
were first made, and why?" 

"Androids are just people. No 
different from humans except that 
they're made instead of born. I 
take it you don't want me to tell 



you the full details of the process. Basically, one starts with a 
few living cells — that's always 
necessary — and gradually forms 
a complete human body. There is 
no difference. I must stress that. 
An android is a man or a woman, 
not in any sense a robot or automaton." 

There was a stir again, and 
the judge smiled faintly. Roderick's witness looked like something of a burden to Roderick. 
But Roderick merely nodded. 
Everything, apparently, was under control. 

"About two hundred years 
ago," the doctor went on, "it was 
shown beyond reasonable doubt 
that the human race was headed 
for extinction fairly soon. The 
population was halving itself 
every generation. Even if human 
life continued, civilization could 
not be maintained ..." 

It was dull for everybody. 
Even Dr. Geller didn't seem very 
interested in what he was saying. 
This was the part that everyone 
knew already. But the judge 
didn't interfere. It was all strictly 
relevant. 

• 

A T first the androids had only 
been an experiment, interesting because they were from the 
first an astonishingly successful 
experiment. There was little failure, and a lot of startling success. 
Once the secret was discovered, 



MADE IN U. S. A. 



13 



one could, by artificial means, 
manufacture creatures who were 
men and women to the last decimal point. There was only one 
tiny flaw. They couldn't reproduce, either among themselves or 
with human partners. Everything 
was normal except that conception never took place. 

But as the human population 
dropped, and as the public services slowed, became inefficient, 
or closed down, it was natural 
that the bright idea should occur 
to someone: Why shouldn't the 
androids do it? 

So androids were made and 
trained as public servants. At 
first they were lower than the 
beasts. But that, to do humanity 
justice, lasted only until it became clear that androids were 
people. Then androids ascended 
the social scale to the exalted 
level of slaves. The curious thing, 
however, was that there was only 
one way to make androids, and 
that was to make them as babies 
and let them grow up. It wasn't 
possible to make only stupid, 
imperfect, adult androids. They 
turned out like humans, good, 
bad and* indifferent. 

And then came the transformation. Human births took an 
upsurge. It was renaissance. 
There was even unemployment 
for a while again. It would have 
been inhuman, of course, to kill 
off the androids, but on the other 



hand, if anyone was going to 
starve, they might as well. 
They did. 

No more androids were made. 
Human births subsided. Androids were manufactured again. 
Human births rose. 

It became obvious at last. The 
human race had not so much 
been extinguishing itself with 
birth control as actually failing 
to reproduce. Most people, men 
and women, were barren these 
days. But a certain proportion of 
this barrenness was psychological. The androids were a challenge. They stimulated a stubborn 
strain deep in humans. 

So a balance was reached. Androids were made for two reasons 
only — -to have that challenging 
effect that kept the human race 
holding its ground, almost replacing its losses, and to do all the 
dirty work of keeping a juggernaut of an economic system 
functioning smoothly for a decimated population. 

Even in the early days, the 
androids had champions. Curiously enough, it wasn't a matter 
of the androids fighting for and 
winning equality, but of humans 
fighting among each other and 
gradually giving the androids 
equality. 

The humans who fought most 
were those who couldn't have 
children. All these people could 
do if they were to have a family 



14 




 



was adopt baby androids. Naturnlly they lavished on them all the 
uffection and care that their own 
children would have had. They 
came to look on them as their 
own children. They therefore were 
very strongly in favor of any 
move to remove restrictions on 
androids. One's own son or 
daughter shouldn't be treated as 
an inferior being. 

That was some of the story, 
as Dr. Geller sketched it. The 
court was restive, the judge looked at the ceiling, the jury looked 
at Alison. Only Roderick was 
politely attentive to Dr. Geller. 

VI 

VERYONE knew at once 
^ when the lull was over. If 
anyone missed Roderick's question, no one missed the doctor's 
answer: " — reasonably established that androids cannot reproduce. At first there was actually 
some fear that they might. It 
was thought that the offspring of 
android and human would be 
some kind of monster. But reproduction did not occur." 

"Just one more point, Doctor," 
said Roderick easily. "There is, 
I understand, some method of 
identification — some means of 
telling human from android, and 
vice versa?" 

"There are two," replied the 
doctor. Some of the people in 



court looked up, interested. 
Others made their indifference 
obvious to show that they knew 
what was coming. "The first is 
the fingerprint system. It is just 
as applicable to androids as to 
humans, and every android at 
every creche is fingerprinted. If 
for any reason it becomes necessary to identify a person jvho 
may or may not be android" 
prints are taken. Once these have 
been sent to every main android 
center in the world — a process 
which takes only two weeks — the 
person is either positively identified as android or by elimination is known to be human." 

"There is no possibility of error?" 

"There is always the possibility of error. The system is perfect, but to err is human — and, 
if I may be permitted the pleasantry, android as well." 

"Quite," said Roderick. "But 
may we take it that the possibility of error in this case is 
small?" 

"You may. As for the other 
method of identification: this is 
a relic of the early days of android manufacture and many of 
us feel — but that is not germane." 

For the first time, however, he 
looked somewhat uncomfortable 
as he went on: "Androids, of 
course, are not born. There is no 
umbilical cord. The navel is 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



15 



small, even and symmetrical, 
and faintly but quite clearly 
marked inside it are the words — 
in this country, at any rate — 
'Made in U.S.A.'" 

A wave of sniggers ran round 
the court. The doctor flushed 
faintly. There were jokes about 
the little stamp that all androids 
carried. Once there had been political cartoons with the label as 
the motif. The point of one allegedly funny story came when 
it was discovered that a legend 
which was expected to be 'Made 
in U.S.A.' turned out to be 'Fabrique en France' instead. 

IT had always been something 
humans could jibe about, the 
stamp that every android would 
carry on his body to his grave. 
Twenty years ago, all persecution of androids was over, supposedly, and androids were free 
and accepted and had all but the 
same rights as humans. Yet 
twenty years ago, women's evening dress invariably revealed the 
navel, whatever else was chastely 
concealed. Human girls flaunted 
the fact that they were human. 
Android girls either meekly 
showed the proof or, by hiding 
it, admitted they were android. 

"There is under review," said 
the doctor, "a proposal to discontinue what some people feel 
must always be a badge of subservience — " 



"That is sub judice," interrupted the judge, "and no part 
of the matter in question. We 
are concerned with things as they 
are." He looked inquiringly at 
Roderick. "Have you finished 
with the witness?" 

"Not only the witness," said 
Roderick, "but my case." He 
looked so pleased with himself 
that Alison, who was difficult to 
anger, wanted to hit him. "You 
have heard Dr. Geller's evidence. 
I demand that Alison submit 
herself to the two tests he mentioned. When it is established 
that she is an android, it will 
also be established that she cannot have a child. And that she 
therefore, by concealing her android status from me, also concealed the fact that she could not 
have a child." 

The judge nodded somewhat 
reluctantly. He looked over his 
glasses at Alison without much 
hope. It would be a pity if such 
a promising case were allowed 
to fizzle out so soon and so 
trivially. But he personally could 
see nothing significant that Alison could offer in rebuttal. 

"Your witness," said Roderick, 
with a gesture that called for a 
kick in the teeth, or so Alison 
thought. 

"Thank you," she said sweetly. 
She rose from her seat and crossed 
the floor. She wore a plain gray 
suit with a vivid yellow blouse, 



16 




 



only a little of it visible, supplying the necessary touch of color. 
She had never looked better in 
licr life and she knew it. 

Roderick looked as though he 
were losing the iron control 
which he had held for so long 
against all her expectations, and 
•.he did what she could to help 
by wriggling her skirt straight in 
the way he had always found so 
attractive. 

"Stop that!" he hissed at her. 
"This is serious." 

She merely showed him twenty-eight of her perfect teeth, and 
then turned to Dr. Geller. 

VII 

"T WAS most interested in a 
phrase you used, Doctor," 
said Alison. "You said it was 
'reasonably established' that androids could not reproduce. Now 
I take it I have the facts correct. You are director of the 
Everton Creche?" 
"Yes." 

"And your professional experience is therefore confined to androids up to the age of ten?" 

"Yes." 

"Is it usual for even humans," 
asked Alison, "to reproduce before the age of ten?" 

There was stunned silence, 
then a laugh, then applause. 
"This is not a radio show," 
shouted the judge. "Proceed, 



if you please, Mrs. Liffcom." 

Alison did. Dr. Geller was the 
right man to come to for all 
matters relating to young androids, she said apologetically, 
but for matters relating to adult 
androids (no offense to Dr. Geller intended, of course), she 
proposed to call Dr. Smith. 

Roderick interrupted. He was 
perfectly prepared to hear Alison's case, but hadn't they better 
conclude his first? Was Alison 
prepared to submit herself to the 
two tests mentioned? 

"It's unnecessary," said Alison. "I am an android. I am not 
denying it." 

"Nevertheless — " said Roderick. 

"I don't quite understand, Mr. 
Liffcom," the judge put in. "If 
there were any doubt, yes. But 
Mrs. Liffcom is not claiming that 
she is not an android." 

"I want to know." 

"Do you think there is any 
doubt?" 

"I only wish there were." 

It was "sensation" again. 

"And yet it's all perfectly natural, when you consider it," said 
Roderick, when he could be 
heard. "I want a divorce because 
Alison is an android and can't 
have a child. If she's been mistaken, or has been playing some 
game, or whatever it might be, 
I don't want a divorce. I want 
Alison, the girl I married. Surely 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



17 



that's easy enough to understand?" 

"All right," said Alison emotionlessly. "It'll take some time 
to check my fingerprints, but the 
other test can be made now. 
What do I do, Judge, peel here 
in front of everybody?" 

"Great Scott, no!" 

Five minutes later, in the jury 
room, the judge, the jury and 
Roderick examined the proof. 
Alison surrendered none of her 
dignity or self-possession while 
showing it to them. 

There was no doubt. The mark 
of the android was perfectly 
clear. 

Roderick was last to look. 
When he had examined the 
brand, his eyes met Alison's, and 
she had to fight back the tears. 
For he wasn't satisfied or angry, 
only sorry. 

T>ACK in court, Roderick said 
he waived the fingerprint test. 
And Alison called Dr. Smith. He 
was older than Dr. Geller, but 
bright-eyed and alert. There was 
something about him — people 
leaned forward as he took the 
stand, knowing ^somehow that 
what he had to say was going to 
be worth hearing. 

"Following the precedent of 
my learned friend," said Alison, 
"may I ask you if you are human 
or android, Dr. Smith?" 

"You may. I am human. How


ever, most of my pat'ents have 
been android." * 

"Why is that?" 

"Because I realized long ago 
that androids represented the future. Humans are losing the fight. 
That being so, I wanted to find 
out what the differences between 
humans and androids were, or if 
there were any at all. If there 
were none, so much the better — 
the human race wasn't going to 
die out, after all." 

"But of course," said Alison 
casually, yet somehow everyone 
hung on her words, "there ( was 
one essential difference. Humanity was becoming sterile, but 
androids couldn't reproduce." 

"There was no difference," 
said Dr. Smith. 

Sometimes an unexpected 
statement produces silence, sometimes bedlam. Dr. Smith got both 
in turn.. There was the stillness 
of shock as he elaborated and 
put his meaning beyond doubt. 

"Androids can have and have 
had children." 

Then the rest was drowned in 
a wave of gasps, whispers and 
exclamations that swelled in a 
few seconds to a roar. The judge 
hammered and shouted in vain. 

There was anger in the shouts. 
There was excitement, anxiety, 
incredulity, fear. Either the doctor was lying or he wasn't. If he 
was lying, he would suffer for it. 
People tricked by such a hoax 



18 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



are angry, vengeful, people. 

If he wasn't lying, everyone 
must re-evaluate his whole view 
of life. Everyone — human and 
android. The old religious questions would come up again. The 
question would be decided of 
whether Man, himself becoming 
extinct, had actually conquered 
life, instead of merely reaching 
a compromise with it. It would 
cease to matter whether any person was born or made. 

There would be no more androids, only human beings. And 
Man would be master of creation. 

VIII 

THE court sat again after a 
brief adjournment. The judge 
peered at Alison and at Dr. 
Smith, who was again on the 
stand. 

"Mrs. Liffcom," he said, "would 
you care to take up your examination at the same point?" 

"Certainly," said Alison. She 
addressed herself to Dr. Smith. 
"You say that androids can have 
children?" 

This time there was silence 
except for the doctor's quiet 
voice. "Yes. There is, as may well 
be imagined, conflicting evidence 
on this. The evidence I propose 
to bring forward has frequently 
been discredited. The reaction 
when I first made this statement 
shows why. It is an important 



question on which everyone must 
have reached some conclusion. 
Possibly one merely believes 
what one is told." 

As he went on, Alison cast a 
glance at Roderick. At first he 
was indifferent. He didn't believe it. Then he showed mild 
interest in what the doctor was 
saying. Eventually he became so 
excited that he could hardly sit 
still. 

And Alison began to hope 
again. 

"There is *a psychologist in 
court," remarked the doctor 
mildly, "who may soon be asking 
me questions. I am not a psychologist any more than any other 
general practitioner, but before 
I mention particular cases, I 
must make this point. Every android grows up knowing he or 
she cannot have children. That 
is accepted in our civilization. 

"I don't think it should be 
accepted. I'll tell you why." 

No one interrupted him. He 
wasn't spectacular, but he wasted 
no time. 

He mentioned the case of 
Betty Gordon Holbein, 178 years 
before. No one had heard of 
Betty Gordon Holbein. She was 
human, said the doctor. Prostrate with shock, she testified she 
had been raped by an android. 
The android concerned was 
lynched. In due course, Betty 
Holbein had a normal child. 



MADE IN. U.S.A. 



19 



"The records are available to 
everyone," said the doctor. "There 
was a lot of interest and indignation when the girl was 
raped, very little when she had 
her child. The suggestion that 
she had conceived after the incident was denied, without much 
publicity, or belief, for even then 
it was known that androids were 
barren." 

"OODERICK was on his feet. 

He looked at the judge, who 
nodded. 

"Look, are you twisting this 
to make a legal case," he demanded, "or did this girl — " 

"You cannot ask the witness 




if he is perjuring himself," remarked the judge reprovingly. 

"I d on 't a damn about 

perjury!" Roderick exclaimed. 
"I just want to know if this is 
true!" 

It was all very irregular; but 
Alison knew he might explode 
any moment and swear at the 
doctor and the judge. She didn't 
want that. So her eyes met his 
and she said levelly: "It's true, 
Roderick." 

Roderick sat down. 

"Now to get a true picture," 
the doctor continued, "we must 
remember that millions of^ androids were being tested, and 
mating among themselves, and 
even having irregular liaisons 
with humans — and no conception 
took- place. Or did it?" 

A little over a century ago, 
an android girl had been found 
in a wood, alive, but only just. 
Around her there were marks of 
many feet. She had been mutilated. Though she lived, she 
was never quite sane after that. 

But she also had a child. 

Roderick rose again, frowning. 
"I don't understand," he said 
"If this is true, why is it not 
known?" 

The judge was going to intervene, but Roderick went on 
quickly, "The doctor and I art 
professional men. I can ask hin 
for a professional opinion, sure 
ly? Well, Doctor?" 


 



* 



"Because it has always been 
possible to disbelieve what one 
has decided to disbelieve. In this 
case, that nameless woman was 
mutilated so that the navel mark 
would be removed. There was a 
record of her fingerprints as those 
of an android. But it was authoritatively stated that there must 
have been a mistake and that, 
by having a child, the woman 
had thus been proved to be human." 

A century and a half ago, 
Winnie — androids had begun to 
have at least a first name by this 
time — had a child and it was 
again decided that this girl, who 
had been a laundry maid, must 
have been mixed up with an android while a baby and was in 
fact human. 



A little dead baby was found 
buried in a garden and an android couple was actually in 
court over the matter. But since 
they were androids, it could obviously not be their child, and 
they were discharged. 

Roderick jumped up again. 
"If you knew this," he asked Dr. 
Smith, "why keep it secret until 
now?" 

"Five years ago," said the doctor, "I wrote an article on the 
subject. I sent it to all the me'dical journals. Kventually one of 
the smaller publications printed 
it. I had half a dozen letters 
from people who were interested. 
Then nothing more. 

"One must admit," he added, 
"that not one of the cases I have 
mentioned — as reported at the 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



21 



time — would be accepted as positive scientific proof that androids can reproduce. The facts 
were recorded for posterity by 
people who didn't believe them. 
But . . ." 

"But," said Alison, a few 
minutes later, when the doctor 
had finished giving his evidence, 
"in view of this, it can hardly be 
stated that I know I cannot have 
a child. It may be unlikely; shall 
I call more medical evidence to 
show how unlikely, conception is 
for the average human woman?" 

JUDGE Collier said nothing, 
so she continued: "The present 
position, as anyone concerned 
with childbirth would tell you, 
is that few marriages produce 
children, but those that do produce a lot. People who can have 
children go on doing it, these 
days. 

"Now I want to introduce a 
new point. It is not grounds for 
divorce among humans if the woman is barren and is not aware 
of it. It is, on the other hand, 
if she has had an operation which 
makes it impossible for her to 
have children and she conceals 
the fact." 

"I see what you are getting at," 
said the judge, "and it is most 
ingenious. Finish it, please." 

"Having had no such operation," said Alison, "and being 
able to prove it, I understand 



that I can't be held, legally, to 
have known that I could never 
have children." 

"To save reference to case histories," said the judge contentedly, "I can say here and now 
that the lady is right. It is for 
the jury to decide on the merits 
of the case, but Mrs. Liffcom 
may be said to have established—" 

"I demand an adjournment," 
said Roderick. 

There was a low murmur that 
gradually died out. Roderick and 
Alison were both on their feet, 
staring at each other across ten 
yards of space. The intensity of 
their feeling could be felt by 
everyone in the courtroom. 

"Court adjourned until tomor 
row," said the judge hastily. 

IX 

ALMOST every newspaper 
which mentioned the Liffcom case committed contempt of 
court. Perhaps the feeling was 
that no action could be taken 
against so many. All the newspapers went into the rights and 
wrongs of the affair as if they 
were giving evidence, too. Very 
little of the material was pro- or 
anti-android. It was, rather, for 
or against the evidence brought 
up. 

Anyone could see, remarked 
one newspaper bluntly, that Ali


22 




 



■ >n Liffcom was nobody's fool. 
1 1 a woman like that went to 
1 lie trouble of defending a suit 
■ if any kind, she would dig up 
■mething good and play it to 
ic limit. This was no aspersion 
tin the morals or integrity of Mrs. 
1 iff com, for whom the newspaper 
!md the keenest admiration. All 
»he had to do was cast the faintest doubt on the truism that anil roids could not reproduce. She 
had done that. 

But that, of course, said the 

iper decisively, didn't mean 
that ancjroids could. 

Another newspaper took it 
from there. Just as good a case, 
it remarked, could have been 
made out for spiritualism, telepathy, possession, the existence 
of werewolves . . . Dr. Smith, 
who was undoubtedly sincere, 
had been misled by a few mistakes. Obviously, when androids 
were human in all respects save 
one, some humans would be 
passed off or mistaken for androids and vice versa. Equally 
obviously, the mistake would 
only be discovered if and when 
conception occurred, as in the 
cases quoted by Dr. Smith. 

A third paper even offered Alison a point to make in court if 
she liked. True enough, Dr. 
Smith had shown that such mistakes could occur. It was only 
necessary for Alison then to 
quote these cases and stress the 



possibility that the same thing 
might have happened to her. If 
the proof of android origin was 
not proof, the case would collapse. 

Other papers, however, took 
the . view that there might be 
something in the possibility that 
androids could reproduce. Why 
not? asked one. Androids weren't 
bloodless, inferior beings. One 
could keep things warm by holding them against the human body 
— or by building a fire. In the 
same way, children could be 
nurtured in a human body or in 
culture tanks. The results were 
identical. They must be identical 
if one could take them forty 
years later, give them rigorous 
tests, and tell one from the other 
only because the android was 
stamped "Made in U.S.A." and 
because his fingerprints were on 
file. 

People had believed androids 
could not have children because 
they had been told, androids 
never had. Now they were told 
androids had reproduced. Where 
was the difficulty? You believed 
you had finished your cigarettes 
until you took out the pack and 
saw there was one left. What did 
you do then — say you had finished them, therefore that what 
looked like a cigarette wasn't, 
and throw it away? 

And almost all the newspapers, 
whatever their general view, 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



23 



asked the real, fundamental 
question as well. 

That artificially rriade humans 
could conceive was credible, in 
theory. That they could not was 
also credible, in theory. 

But why one in a million, one 
in five million, one in ten million? Even present-day humans 
could average one fertile marriage in six.

"TF you have no objections," 
said Roderick politely — determined to be on his best be-havior, thought Alison — "let's 
turn this into a court of inquiry. 
Let's say, if you like, that Alison 
has successfully defended the 
case on the grounds that she 
can't legally be said to have 
known she couldn't have a child. 
Forget the divorce. That's not 
the point." 

"I thought it was," the judge 
objected, dazed. 

"Anyone can see that what . 
matters now," said Roderick impatiently, "is what Dr. Smith 
brought up: Let's get down to 
the question of whether there's 
any prospect of Alison having a 
baby." 

"A courtroom is hardly the 
place to settle that," murmured 
Alison. But she felt the first warm 
breath of . a glow of happiness 
she had thought she would never 



be able to experience again. 

"Women always go from the 
general to the particular," Roderick retorted. "I don't mean the 
question of whether you will 
have children. I mean the question of whether it's really possible that you might." . i 

The judge rapped decisively. I 
have been too lenient. I insist on, 
having a certain amount of order 
in my own court. Roderick Liff-. 
com, do you withdraw your 
suit?" 

"What does it matter? Anyway, if you must follow^that line, j 
we'd have to have a few straight I 
questions and answers like 
whether Alison still loves me." 

The judge gasped. j 

"Do you?" demanded Roder- J 
ick, glaring at Alison. 1 

Alison felt as if her heart was 
going to explode. "If you want a 
straight answer," she said, "yes." 

"Good," said Roderick with 
satisfaction. "Now we can go on 
from there." 

He turned to glower at Judge 
Collier, who was trying to interrupt. 

"Look here," Roderick de T 
manded, "are you interested in ' 
getting at the truth?" 

"Certainly, but — " 

"So am I. Be quiet, then. I 
meant to keep my temper with 
you, but you're constantly getting in my hair. Alison, would 
you mind taking the stand?" 



24 




 



There was no doubt that Rod■ k had personality. 

With Alison on the stand, he 
' tied to the jury. "I'll tell you 
it I have in mind," he told 
m in friendly fashion. "We all 
ider why, if this thing's posi<\ it's happened so seldom, 
i 1 1 1 fortunately, to date there 
Iwtsn't been any real admission 
• 1 >t it is possible,, so I didn't 
now. I never had a chance to 
work on it. Now I have. What I 
wnnt to know is, if androids can 
I ive children, what prevents 
in' m from doing so." 

He reached out absently, without looking around, and squeezed 
Alison's shoulder. "We've got Ali•ion here," Roderick went on. 
"Let's find out if we can, shall 
we, what would stop her from 
having children?" 

Alison was glad she was sitting 
down. Her knees felt so weak 
that she knew they wouldn't support her. Did she have Roderick 
back or didn't she? Could she 
really have a baby? Roderick's 
baby? The court swam dizzily in 
front of her eyes. 

Only gradually did she become 
aware of Roderick's voice asking 
anxiously if she was all right, 
Roderick bending over her, Roderick's arm behind her back, supporting her. 

"Yes," she said faintly. "I'm 
sorry. Roderick, I'll help you all 
I can, but do you think there's 



really very much chance?" 

"I'm a psychologist," he reminded her quietly, "and since 
you've never seen me at work, 
there's no harm in telling you I'm 
pretty good. Maybe we won't 
work this out here in half an 
hour, but we'll get through it in 
the next sixty years." 

Alison didn't forget where she 
was, but everything was so crazy 
that a little more wouldn't hurt. 
She reached up and drew his 
lips down to hers.

"W/"HAT I'm locking for must 
be in the life of every android, male and female," said 
Roderick. "I don't expect to find 
it right away. Just tell us, Alison, 
about any times when you were 
aware of distinction — when you 
were made aware that you were 
an android, not a human. Start 
as early as you like. 

"And," hie added with a sudden, unexpected grin, "please address your remarks to the judge. 
Let's keep this as impersonal as 
we can." 

Alison composed her mind for 
, the job. She didn't really want 
to look back. She wanted to look 
into the new, marvelous future. 
But she forced herself to begin. 

"I grew up in the New York 
Android Creche," she said. 
"There was no distinction there. 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



25 



Sorne of the children thought 
there was. Sometimes I heard 
older children talking about how 
much better off they would be 
if they were humans. But twice 
when there was overcrowding in 
the creche and plenty of room 
at the orphanage for human children, I was moved to the orphanage. And there was absolutely no 
difference. 

"In a creche, it's far more important to be able to sell yourself than it ever can be later. If 
you're attractive or appealing 
enough, someone looking for a 
child to adopt will notice you and 
you'll have a home and security 
and affection. I wasn't attractive 
or appealing. I stayed in the 
creche until I was nine. I saw so 
many couples looking for children, always taking away some 
child but never me, that I was 
sure I would stay there until I 
was too old to be adopted and 
then have to earn my living, 
always on my own. 

"Then, one day, one of the 
sisters at the creche found me 
crying — I forget what I was crying about — and told me there was 
no need for me to cry about anything because I had brains and , 
" I was going to be a beauty, and 
what more could any girl want? 
I looked in the mirror, but I still 
seemed the same as ever. She 
must have known what she was 
talking about, though, for just 



a week later, a couple came 
and looked around the creche and 
picked me." 

Alison took a deep breath, and 
there was no acting about the 
tears in her eyes. 

"Nobody who's never experienced it can appreciate what it 
is to have a home for the first 
time at the age of nine," she 
said. "To say I'd have died for 
my new parents doesn't tell half 
of it. Maybe this is something 
that misled Roderick. He knew 
that twice a month, at least, I go 
and see my folks. He must hav 
thought they were my real parents, so he didn't ask if I was 
android." 

She looked at Roderick for 
the first time since she started 
the story. He nodded. 

"Go on, Alison," he said quietly. "You're doing fine." 

"This isn't a hard world for 
androids," Alison insisted. "It's 
only very occasionally . . ." 

She stopped, and Roderick had 
to prompt her. "Only very occasionally that what?" 

But Alison wasn't with him. 
She was eleven years back in the 
past. 

XII 

ALISON had known all about 
that awkward period when 
she would cease to be a child and 
become a woman. But she had 



26 




 



e ver quite realized how rapid it 
■ >uld be, and how it would seem 
vi-n more rapid, so that it was 
vcr before she was ready for it to 
lurt. 

She wasn't sleeping well, but 
lie was so healthy and had such 
< serves of strength that it didn't 
how, and for once her adopted 
i >arents failed her. Though Alison 
vould never admit that, it would 
:ive been so much easier if Sutn had talked with her, and 
Koger, without saying a word, 
1 1 ad indicated in his manner that 
uc knew what was going on. 

One day she was out walking, 
trying to tire herself for sleep 
later, and ran into a group of 
youths of her own age in the 
woods. She knew one of them 
slightly, Bob Thomson, and she 
knew that their apparent leader, 
as tall as a man at fifteen, was 
Harry Hewitt. She didn't know 
whether any of them were androids or not — the question had 
never occurred to her. And it 
didn't seem of any immediate interest or importance that she was 
an android, either, as she passed 
through them and some of them 
whistled, and involuntarily, completely aware of their eyes on 
her, she reddened. 

She saw Bob Thomson whisper 
to Harry Hewitt and Hewitt 
burst out: "Android,, eh? Android! That's fine!" He stepped 
in front of her and barred her 



path. "What a pretty android," 
he said loudly, playing to his 
gallery. "I've seen you before, 
but I thought you were just a 
girl. Take off your blouse, android." 

There was a startled movement in the group, and someone 
nudged Hewitt. 

"It's all right," he said. "She's 
an android. No real parents, only 
people who have taken her in to 
pretend they can have kids." 

Alison looked from side to side 
like a cornered animal. 

"Humans can do anything they 
like with androids," Hewitt told 
his more timorous companions. 
"Don't you know that?" He 
turned back to Alison. "But we 
must be sure she is an android. 
Hold her, Butch." 

Alison was grasped firmly by 
the hips, which had so recently 
stopped being boyish and swelled 
alarmingly. She kicked and 
struggled, her heart threatening 
to burst, but Butch, whoever he 
was, was strong. Two other boys 
held her arms. Carefully, to a 
chorus of nervous, excited sniggers, Hewitt parted her blouse 
and skirt a narrow slit and peered 
at her navel. 

"Made in U.S.A.," he said with 
satisfaction. "It's all right, then." 

In contrast to his previous cautious, decorous manner, he tore 
the blouse out of her waistband 
and ripped it off. Alison's knees 



MADE IN U.S.A.

sagged as someone behind her 
began to fumble with her brassiere. 

"No, no!" Hewitt exclaimed in 
mock horror. "Mustn't do that 
until she says you can. Even 
androids have rights. Or at least, 
if they haven't, we should be 
polite and pretend they have. 
Android, say we can do whatever 
we like with you." 

"No!" cried Alison. 

"That's too bad. Shift your 
grip a bit, Butch." 

The rough hands went up 
around her ribs, rasping her soft 
skin. 

Alison struggled and twisted 
wildly. 

"Keep still," said Hewitt. He 
spoke very quietly, but there was 
savage joy in his face. Slowly 
and carefully, he loosened Alison's belt and eased her skirt and 
the white trunks under it down to 
the pit of her stomach. Then he 
took out a heavy clasp- knife, 
opened it and set the point neatly 
in the center of her belly. Alison 
drew in her stomach; the knife* 
point followed, indenting the 
flesh. 

"Say we can do whatever we 
like with you, android." 

The knife pricked deeper. A 
tiny drop of crimson came from 
under it and ran slowly down to 
Alison's skirt. Her nerve broke. 

"You can do whatever you like 
with me!" she screamed. 



HER brassiere came loose and 
fluttered to the ground. Hewitt's knife cut her belt and her 
skirt began to slip over her hips. 
Butch's hands went down to her 
waist again, biting into it cruelly. 
From behind, a hand tentatively 
touched her breast and another 
clutched her shoulder. One at a 
time, her feet were raised and 
the shoes taken off them and 
thrown in the bushes. 

But someone else had heard 
Alison's scream. Long after she 
had thought no one would 
come, someone did. 

"Hell," said Hewitt as one of 
his companions shouted and 
pointed, "something always spoils 
everything. Beat it, boys." 

They were gone. Alison clutched her skirt and looked behind her 
thankfully. A man and a woman 
were only a few yards from her. 
The woman was young and 
heavy with child. Humans, both 
of them. She opened her mouth 
to thank them, to explain, to 
weep. 

But they were looking at her 
as if she were a crushed beetle 
of some kind. 

"Android, of course," said the 
man disgustedly. "Dirty little 
beast." 

"Hardly more than a child," 
the woman said, "and already at 
this." 

"I think I'll give her a good 
hiding," the man went on.

"Won't do any good, I suppose, 
>>ut ..." 

Alison burst into tears and 
darted among the bushes. She 
didn't wait to see whether the 
man started after her. Branches 
and thorns tore her skin. Her 
skirt dropped and tripped her. 
She flew headlong, flinched away 
from a thorny bush, slammed 
hard into a tree-trunk, and waited 
on the ground, sick and breathless, for the man to beat her. • 

Her legs and arms and shoulders were covered with long 
scratches and a wiry branch had 
lashed her ribs like a whip, leaving a long weal. But that didn't 
matter. A twisted root was digging into her side — that, too, 
didn't matter. Nothing mattered. 
Why had no one told her she 
was an inferior being?. Somehow 
she had known; she had always 
known. But no one had ever 
±hown her before. 

She realized afterward why the 
man and the woman, who must 
have seen or guessed what had 
really happened, had spoken as 
they did. They had, or were going to have, children. They hated 
all androids. Androids were unnecessary, their enemies, and the 
enemies of their children. 

But at the time she merely 
waited helpless, 'incapable of 
thought. The man would come 
and beat her, Susan and Roger 
would turn her away, and she 



would never know happiness 
again.

"1%/ffY parents never knew about 
■L" that," said Alison. "I hid 
in the bushes until it was dark, 
and then went straight home. I 
climbed into my bedroom from 
the outhouse and pretended later I'd been there for hours." 

"Why didn't you tell anyone?" 
Roderick asked. 

Alison shrugged. "It was a 
small incident that concerned me 
alone. I knew, once I'd had time 
to think, that my adopted, parents would be upset and angry, 
but not at me. I thought ( I'd 
better keep it to myself. I wasn't 
hurt and none of it matters when 
you look back on it, does it?" 

"How about the man who was 
going to give you a good hiding?" 

"I never saw him again. It was 
two years later when I got my 
first punishment." 

"Just a minute," said Roderick. "You said that even then 
you knew you were an inferior 
being — you had always known, 
but this was the first time anyone showed you. How had you 
known? Who or what had told 
you? When? Where?" 

Alison tried. They could see 
her try. But she had to say: "I 
don't know." 

"All right," said Roderick, as 



MADE IN U.S.A.

if it weren't important. "What 
was this that happened two years 
later?" 

"Perhaps I am giving too much 
significance to these incidents," 
Alison remarked apologetically. 
"Certainly they happened. But 
when I say 'two years passed,' 
perhaps I'm not making it clear 
that in those two years hardly 
unj*thing happened, hardly anything was said or done, to remind 
me I was an android and not a 
human being. 

"When I was about sixteen or 
seventeen, I suddenly developed 
a talent for tennis. I had played 
since I was quite young, but just 
as front-rank players run in and 
out of form, I improved quite unexpectedly. I joined a new club. 
I was picked for an important 
match. I was in singles, mixed 
and women's doubles. I did well, 
but that's not the point. 

"After the match, my doubles 
partner told me I was wanted in 
the locker room. There was 
something strange about the way 
she told me, but I couldn't place 
it. I wondered if I'd broken some 
rule, failed to check with someone, played in the wrong match, 
or forgotten to bow three times 
to the east — you know what these 
clubs are like." 

"No, we don't," said Judge 
Collier. "We know nothing, remember? Tell us." 

Unexpectedly, he .got an ap


proving nod from the unpredictable Roderick. 

XIV 

A LI SON smiled uncertainly as 
she followed Veronica. She 
wasn't nervous or sensitive as a 
.rule; she seldom felt apprehension. She was curious, naturally, 
and even wilder possibilities suggested themselves. Had she been 
mistaken for someone else? Had 
someone stolen something and 
they thought she'd done it? Had 
someone inspected her racket and 
found it was an inch too wide? 

The whole team was waiting in 
the locker room. It looked serious, especially when she saw their 
expressions. It still didn't occur 
to her that the fact that she was 
an android could have anything 
to do with it. Only once in her 
life had there been any real indication^that in some way androids were inferior beings. 

But that was what it was. Bob 
Walton, the captain of the team, 
said gravely that their opponents, 
well beaten, had accused them of 
recruiting star androids to help 
them. 

Alison laughed. "That's a new 
one. I've heard some peculiar excuses. Made them myself, too — 
the light was bad, the umpire 
was crazy, I had a stone in my 
shoe, people were moving about, 
the net was too high. But never 



MADE IN U.S. A

'You fielded androids against us.' 
Androids are just ordinary people — good and bad tennis players. The open singles champion is 
an android, but the number one 
woman is human. You know that 
as well as I do. Might as well 
complain because you're beaten 
by tall people, or short people, 
or people with long arms." 

Everyone had relaxed. 

"Sorry, Alison," said Walton. 
"It's just that none of us knew 
you weren't an android." 

Alison frowned. "What's all 
this? I'm an android, sure. I 
didn't say so only because nobody asked me." 

"We took it for granted," said 
Walton stiffly, "that you would 
know ... as, of course, you did. 
There are no androids competing 
in the Athenian League. We try 
to keep one group, at least, 
clean." 

He looked at the other two men 
in the team and inclined his 
head. Without a word they left 
the room, all three of them. 

Alison, left with the other 
three girls, one of whom she had 
kept out of the team, looked exasperated. 

"This is nonsense," she said. 
"If you like to run an all-human 
league, that's all right as far as 
I'm concerned l but you should 
put up notices to avoid misunderstanding. I didn't know you 
were — " 



"Whether you knew or not is 
beside the point," said Veronica 
coldly — the same Veronica who 
had laughed and talked and won \ 
a match with Alison only a few 1 
minutes before. "We're going to ' 
make sure you never forget." 

THEY closed in on her. It was 
to be a fight, apparently. Alison didn't mind. She jabbed Veronica in the ribs and sent her 
gasping across the room. She expected them to tear her clothes, 
thinking it would be conventional 
in dealing with android girls. But 
it was quite different from the 
scene in the bushes. This was 
clean and sporting. The men had 
left, very properly, and instead of 
half a dozen youths with a knife 
against a terrified child, it was 
only three girls to one. 

Alison fought hard, but fair. 
She guessed that, if she didn't 
fight clean, it would be ammunition for the android-haters. To do 
them justice, the other girls were 
clean, too. They didn't mind 
hurting her, but they didn't go 
for her face, use their nails or 
yank her hair. 

Alison gave a good account of 
herself, but other things being 
equal, three will always overcome one. She was turned on her 
face on the floor. One of the girls 
sat on her legs and one on her 
shoulders while the third beat 
the seat of her shorts with a 



32 




 



i irmly swung racket. 

It was no joke. Alison wouldn't 
have made a sound if it had 
>ren far worse, but when they 
i ft her go, she was feeling sorry 
lor herself. They left her alone 
>i\ the room. 

She picked herself up and 
lusted herself off. The floor was 
lean and the mirror in one 
■ orner showed that she looked 
ill right. In fact, she looked coniderably better than the three 
r.irls who had beaten her. 

Still angry, she was able 
io grin philosophically at the 
thought that she could beat them 
all in a beauty contest and at 
tennis. She could tell herself, if 
she liked, that they were jealous 
of her. It was probably at least 
partly true. 

Her feelings were hurt, but 
there was no other damage. She 
could even see their point of 
view. 

XV 

"YV7HAT was their point of 
of view?" asked Roderick. 

"Well, they were human and 
they were snobs. They'd even 
have admitted they were snobs, 
if you put the question the right 
way. It was a private club — " 

"And it was quite reasonable," 
suggested Roderick softly, "that 
they should exclude androids, 
who are inferior beings." 



"No, not quite that," Alison 
protested, laughing. "I don't 
really believe . . ." 

She stopped. 

"Just sometimes?" Roderick 
persisted. "Or just one part of 
you, while the other knows quite 
well an android is as good as a 
human?" 

Alison shivered suddenly. "You 
know, I have a curious feeling, as 
if I were being trapped into 
something." 

"That's how people always 
feel," said Roderick, "just before they decide they needn't be 
terrified any more of spiders or 
whatever it was they feared." 

The court was very quiet. 
There was something about 
Roderick's professional competence and Alison's determination 
to cooperate that made any kind 
of interruption out of the question. 

"There's very little more I can 
say about this," said Alison. "I 
took a job, not because I had to, 
but because I wanted to. It was 
with an advertising agency. They 
knew I was an android. They 
paid jne exactly what they paid 
anyone else. When I did well, 
they gave me a raise. 

"But then I noticed something 
— I never got any credit for 
anything. When I had an idea, 
somehow it was always possible 
to give the credit to someone else. 
Soon there was a very curious 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



33 



situation. I held a very junior 
position, I had little or no standing, but I did responsible work 
and I was paid well for it. 

"I went to another agency and 
it was quite different. Again, they 
knew I was an android, but no 
one seemed remotely interested. 
When I did well, I was promoted. When I did badly on any 
job, my chief swore at me and 
called me a fool and an incompetent and an empty-headed 
glamor girl and a lot of things 
I'd rather not repeat here. 

"But it never seemed to occur 
to him to call me a dirty android. I don't think he was an 
android himself, either. 

"I joined a dramatic society, 
but again I chose the wrong club. 
They didn't mind at all that I 
was an android. They didn't keep 
me in small parts. But it was 
perfectly natural that the three 
human girls in the cast shouldn't 
want to use the same dressing 
room as another android girl in 
the show and I did. When we 
were at small places, she and I 
had to change in the wings. 

"There were scores of other little incidents of the same kind. 
They multiplied as I grew older 
— not because differentiation was 
getting worse, but because I was 
moving in -higher society. In 
places where it's held against you 
that you didn't go to Harvard or 
Yale, naturally it's a disadvan


tage if you're an android, besides. 

"Then a law was passed and ' 
it was no longer necessary to 
admit being an android. I don't 
know what the Athenian Tennis 
League did about that. I'd come | 
to Everton then and hardly any- J 
one knew I was an android. And 
the plain fact, despite everything 
I've said, is that hardly anyone , 
cared. There are so many an- I 
droids, so many humans. You ] 
may find yourself the only android in a group — or the only 
human. 

"Then I met Roderick." 

"There," said Roderick, "i 
think we can stop." He turned t 
the judge. "I'm withdrawing my 
suit, of course. I think I made 
that clear quite a while ago." 

He gave Alison his arm. "Come 
on, sweetheart, let's go." 

THE roar burst out again. It 
must have been both one of 
the noisiest and one of the quietest trials oh record. The judge, 
dignity forgotten, was standing 
up, hopping from one foot to 
the other in impatience and vexation. 

"You can't go like that!"* he 
shrieked. "We haven't finished 
. . . we don't know . . ." 

"I've gone as far as I can 
here," said Roderick. He hesitated as the roar grew. "All 
right," he went on, raising his 
voice. "But you don't explain 



34 




 



•' "plr to themselves. Any little 
ks that make them do funny 
Iiiiirs, or not do normal things, 
" get them gradually to exii to you, and to themselves." 
Me searched in his pockets and 
d out a key ring. "Go and 
•..hi in the car, honey," he said, 
• nd told Alison where it was. 
ilw went, dazed. 

"I'll have to keep the papers 
Horn her for a day or two," Rod■ rick went on, almost to himself. 

After that, it won't matter." He 
"nucd his attention to the court. 

All right, then, listen. If I'm 
i mht, I've found something that's 
i>rcn under everyone's nose for 
' wo hundred years and has never 
iwh seen before. I don't say I 
lound it in five minutes. I've 
Urrn working it out for the last 
twenty-four hours, with the help 
of quite a few records of android 
patients. 

"Will you listen?" he yelled as 
the excited chatter increased. "I 
don't want to tell you this. I 
want to go home with Alison. 
You've seen her. Wouldn't you 
want to?" 

The court gradually settled. 
"Let's consider human sterility 
for a moment," said Roderick. 
"As you might imagine, some of 
it's medical and some psychological. As a psychologist, I've cured 
people of so-called barrenness — 
nnd when I did, of course, it 
wasn't sterility at all, but a neu


rosis. These people didn't and 
don't have children because, owing to some unconscious conclusion they've reached, they don't 
want them, feel they shouldn't 
have them, or are certain they 
can't have them. 

"But that's only some. Others 
come to me and, in consultation 
with a specialist in that line, I 
find there's nothing psychological 
about it whatever. 

"I have an idea, now, that all 
androids are psychologically sterile. Sterility has eaten into the 
cycle of human reproduction but 
how should it touch the androids? 
If one android can reproduce, 
they all can. Unless they, like 
these humans I've cured, have 
reached unconscious conclusions 
to the effect that androids can't 
or shouldn't or mustn't have 
children. 

"And we know they nearly all 
have." 

TITS voice suddenly dropped, 
and when Roderick spoke 
quietly, he was emphasizing 
points and people listened. There 
was no murmuring now. 

"I think if you were to run a 
survey and find who now is continuing to deny — passionately, 
honestly, sincerely — that androids can reproduce, you'd find 
the most passionate, honest and 
sincere are androids. If you 
looked into the past, I think 



MADE IN U. S. A. 



35 



you'd find the same thing. 
Wasn't it significant that it had 
to be a human doctor who declared publicly that androids 
weren't sterile? 

"Into every android is built 
the psychological axiom that an 
android must be inferior to a 
human to survive. That's the answer. Androids don't come to me 
to be cured of this because they 
don't want to be cured of it. 
They know it's essential to them. 
With the more aware part of 
their brains, they may know exactly the opposite, but that 
doesn't count when it comes to 
things like this. 

"And long ago, without knowing it, androids picked on this. 
Androids could not be a menace 
if they couldn't reproduce. Androids would be duly inferior if 
they couldn't reproduce. Androids would be allowed to exist 
if they couldn't reproduce. Androids could compete with humans in other things if . they 
couldn't reproduce." 

He knew he was right as he 
looked around the court. For 
once, almost at a glance, it was 
possible to tell humans from androids. Half the people in court 
were interested, bored, amused, 
indifferent, thoughtful — the humans. The* other half were angry, frightened, ashamed, apathetic, resentful, wildly excited, 
or in tears . . . for Roderick was 



tearing at the very foundation 
of their world. 

"I have real hopes for Alison," 
he remarked mildly, "because • 
she brought in Dr. Smith. See 
what that means? Not one an 
droid in a thousand could have 
done it. She must love me a lot 
. . . but that's none of your 
business." 

He went the way Alison had 
gone. No one tried to stop him 
this time. At the door, he paused. 

"When the first acknowledged 
android children are born," he 
observed, "it'll mean that regardless of the trials or disasters 
mankind still has to face, the 
human race won't die out. Because ... I think we might all 
chew a little on this point . . . 
the children of androids can't be 
android, can they?" 

XVII 

RODERICK drove. Alison 
usually did when they were 
out in a car together, but there 
was an unspoken agreement that 
Roderick would have to take 
charge of almost everything for 
a while. 

"We both won," she said happily. "At least, we will have when 
little Roderick arrives." 

"Do you believe he will?" 
asked Roderick, in his professional, neutral tone. 

"Not quite. I wonder what you 



.36 




 



•xtid in the court. I suppose I'm 
not to try to find out?" 

"FincJ out if you like. But do 
it from yourself. From what's in 
vou. I'll help." 

"I think," Alison mused, "it 
must be something to do with 
I >r Smith." 

"Oh? Why?" 

"Because I had the most peculiar feeling when I remembered 
lirnring about him and the idea 
Hint androids could have children. Like when Hewitt had his 
Unife in my stomach, only as 
if . . ." 

She laughed nervously, unomfortably. "As if I were holding; it myself, and had to cut 
omething out, but couldn't do 
it without killing myself. Yet I 
had a sort of idea I could cut 
it out, if I tried hard enough and 
long enough, and not kill myself." 

Roderick turned the corner into their street. "This is a little 
unprofessional," he said, the exhilaration in his voice ill-concealed, "but I don't think it'll do 
any harm with you, Alison. 
There is going to be a little 
Roderick. I didn't decide it. You 



decided it. And it won't kill you. 
And — God, look at that!" 

Cameras clicked like grasshoppers as Roderick Liffcom carried 
his bride across the threshold. 
The photographers hadn't had to 
follow them, for they knew where 
the Liffcoms were going. Scores 
of plates were exposed. The Liffcoms were news. The name of 
Liffcom was known to almost 
everyone. 

Roderick was big and strong 
enough to treat his wife's 115 
pounds with contempt, but there 
was no contempt in the way he 
held her. He carried her as if she 
was made of crystal which the 
faintest jar would shatter. One 
could see at a glance that he 
could have carried any girl he 
liked over the threshold. 

Alison nestled in his arms like 
a kitten, eyes half-closed with 
rapture, arms about Roderick's 
neck. One could see at a glance 
she could have been carried over 
the threshold by any man she 
liked. 

As they went in, it was the 
beginning of a story. -But let's be 
different and call it the end.
