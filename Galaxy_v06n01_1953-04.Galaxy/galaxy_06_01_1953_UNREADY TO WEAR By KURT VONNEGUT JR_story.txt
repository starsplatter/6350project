UNREADY TO WEAR By KURT VONNEGUT, JR. 


I DON'T suppose the oldsters, 
those of us who weren't born 
into it, will ever feel quite 
at home being amphibious — amphibious in the new sense of the 
word. I still catch myself feeling 
blue about things that don't matter any more. 

I can't help worrying about my 
business, for instance — or what 
used to be my business. After all, • 
I spent thirty years building the 



thing up from scratch, and now 
the equipment is rusting and getting clogged with dirt. But even 
though I know it's silly of me 
to care what happens to the business, I borrow a body from a storage center every so often, and go 
around the old home town, and 
clean and oil as much of the 
equipment as I can. 

Of course, all in the world, the 
equipment was good for was making money, and Lord knows 
there's plenty of that lying 
around. Not as much as there 
used to be, because there at first 
some people got frisky and threw 
it all around, and the wind blew 
it every which way. And a lot of 
go-getters gathered up piles of 
the stuff and hid it somewhere. 
I hate to admit it, but I gathered 
up close to a half million myself 
and stuck it away. I used to get it 
out and count it sometimes, but 
that was years ago. Right now I'd 
be hard put to say where it is. 

But the worrying I do about 
my old business is bush league 
stuff compared to the worrying 
my wife, Madge, does about our 
old house. That thing is what she 
herself put in thirty years on 
while I was building the business. 
Then no sooner had we gotten 
nerve enough to build and decorate the place than everybody 
we cared anything about got amphibious. Madge borrows a body 
once a month and dusts the place, 
though the only thing a house is 
good for now is keeping termites 
and mice from getting pneumonia. 

WHENEVER it's my turn to 
get into a body and work as 
an attendant at the local storage 
center, I realize all over again 
how much tougher it is for women to get used to being amphibious. 



Madge borrows bodies a lot 
oftener than I do, and that's true 
of women in general. We have to 
keep three times as many women's bodies in stock as men's 
bodies, in order to meet the demand. Every so often, it seems 
as though a woman just has to 
have a body, and doll it up in 
clothes, and look at herself in a 
mirror. And Madge, God bless 
her, I don't think she'll be satisfied until she's tried on every 
body in every storage center on 
Earth. 

It's been a fine thing for Madge, 
though. I never kid her about it, 
because it's done so much for her 
personality. Her old body, to tell 
you the plain blunt truth, wasn't 
anything to get excited about, 
and having to haul the thing 
around made her gloomy a lot of 
the time in the old days. She 
couldn't help it, poor soul, any 
more than anybody else could 
help what sort of body they'd 
been born with, and I loved her 
in spite of it. 

Well, after we'd learned to be 
amphibious, and after we'd built 
the storage centers and laid in 
body supplies and opened them 
to the public, Madge went hog 
wild. She borrowed a platinum 
blonde body that had been donated by a burlesque queen, and" 
I didn't think we'd ever get her 
out of it. As I say, it did-wonders 
for her self-confidence.

I'm like most men and don't 
care particularly what body I 
get. Just the strong, good-looking, 
healthy bodies were put in storage, so one is as good as the 
next one. Sometimes, when 
Madge and I take bodies out together for old times' sake, I let 
her pick out one for me to watch 
whatever she's got on. It's a funny thing how she always picks a 
blond, tall one for me. 

My old body, which she claims 
she loved for a third of a century, 
had black hair, and was short and 
paunchy, too, there toward the 
last. I'm human and I couldn't 
help being hurt when they 
scrapped it after I'd left it, instead of putting it in storage. It 
was a good, homy, comfortable 
body; nothing fast and flashy, 
but reliable. But there isn't much 
call for that kind of body at the 
centers, I guess. I never ask for 
one, at any rate. 

The worst experience I ever 
had with a body was when I was 
flimflammed into taking out the 
one that had belonged to Dr. Ellis Konigswasser. It belongs to 
the Amphibious Pioneers' Society 
and only gets taken out once a 
year but for the big Pioneers' 
Day Parade, on the anniversary 
of Konigswasser'ff discovery. 
Everybody said it was a great 
honor for me to be picked to get 
into Konigswasser's body and 
lead the parade. 



Like a plain damn fool, I believed them. 

qpHEY'LL have a tough time 
getting me into that thing 
again — ever. Taking that wreck 
out certainly made it plain why* 
Konigswasser discovered how 
people could do without their 
bodies. That old one of his practically drives you out. Ulcers, 
headaches, arthritis, fallen arches 
— a nose like a pruning hook, 
piggy little eyes, and a complexion like a used steamer trunk. He 
was and still is the sweetest person you'd ever want to know, 
but, back when he was stuck with 
that body, nobody got close 
enough to find out. 

We tried to get Konigswasser 
back into his old body to lead 
us when we first started having 
the Pioneers' Day Parades, but 
he wouldn't have anything to do 
with it, so we always have to 
flatter some poor boob into taking on the job. Konigswasser 
marches, all right, but as a sixfoot cowboy who can bend beer 
cans double between his thumb 
and middle finger. 

Konigswasser is just like a kid 
with that body. He never gets 
tired of bending beer cans with 
it, and we all have to stand 
around in our bodies after the 
parade, and watch as though we 
were very impressed. 

I don't suppose he could bend

very much of anything back in 
the old days. 

Nobody mentions it to him, 
since he's the grand old man of 
the Amphibious Age, but he plays 
hell with bodies. Almost every 
time he takes one out, he busts 
it, showing off. Then somebody 
has to get into a surgeon's body 
and sew it up again. 

I don't mean to be disrespectful of Konigswasser. As a matter 
of fact, it's a respectful thing to 
say that somebody is childish in 
certain ways, because it's people 
like that who seem to get all the 
big ideas. 

There is a picture of him in 
the old days down at the Historical Society, and you can see from 
that that he never did grow up 
as far as keeping up his appearance went — doing what little he 
could with the rattle-trap body 
Nature had issued him. 

His hair was down below his 
collar, he wore his pants so low 
that his heels wore through the 
legs above the cuffs, and the lining of his coat hung down in 
festoons all around the bottom. 
And he'd forget meals, and go 
out into the cold or wet without 
enough clothes on, and he would 
never notice sickness until it almost killed him. He was. what 
we used to call absent-minded. 
Looking back now, of course, we 
•say he was starting to be amphibious. 



TZ"ONIGSWASSER was a 
mathematician, and he did 
all his living with his mind. The 
body he had to haul around with 
that wonderful mind was about 
as much use to him as a flat car 
of scrap-iron. Whenever he got 
sick and had to pay some attention to his body, he'd rant somewhat like this: 

"The mind is the only thing 
about human beings that's worth 
anything. Why does it have to 
be tied to a bag of skin, blood, 
hair, meat, bones, and tubes? No 
wonder people can't get anything 
done, stuck for life with a parasite that has to be stuffed with 
food and protected from weather 
and germs all the time. And the 
fool thing wears out anyway — 
no matter how much you stuff 
and protect it! 

"Who," he wanted to know, 
"really wants one of the things? 
What's so wonderful about protoplasm that we've got to carry 
so damned many pounds of it 
with us wherever we go? 

"Trouble with the world," said 
Konigswasser, "isn't too many 
people — it's too many bodies." 

When his teeth went bad on 
him, and he had to have them all 
out, and he couldn't get a set of 
dentures that were at all comfortable, he wrote in his diary, 
"If living matter was able to 
evolve enough to get out of the 
ocean, which was really quite a 



UNREADY TO WEAR 



101 



pleasant place to live, it certainly 
ought to be able to take another 
step and get out of bodies, which 
are pure nuisances when you stop 
to think about them." 

He wasn't a prude about 
bodies, understand, and he wasn't 
jealous of people who had better 
ones than he did. He just thought 
bodies were a lot more trouble 
than they were worth. 

He didn't have great hopes that 
people would really evolve out of 
their bodies in his time. He just 
wished they would. Thinking 
hard about it, he walked through 
a park in his shirtsleeves and 
stopped off at the zoo to watch 
the lions being fed. Then, when 
the rainstorm turned to sleet, he 
headed back home and was interested to see firemen on the 
edge of a lagoon, where they 
were using a pulmotor on a 
drowned man. 

Witnesses said the old man 
had walked right into the water 
and had kept going without 
changing his expression until he'd 
disappeared. Konigswasser got a 
look at the victim's face and said 
he'd never seen a better reason 
for suicide. He started for home 
again and was almost there before he realized that that was his 
own body lying back there. 

TTE went back fo reoccupy the 
body just as the firemen got 
it breathing again, and he walked 



it home, more as a favor to the 
city than anything else. He walked it into his front closet, got out 
of it again, and left it there. 

He took it out only when he 
wanted to do some writing or 
turn the pages of a book, or when i 
he had to feed it so it would have 
enough energy to do the few odd .: 
jobs he gave it. The rest of the >, 
time, it sat motionless in the 
closet, looking dazed and using ' 
almost no energy. Konigswasser 
told me the other day that he ■] 
used to run the thing for about ' 
a dollar a week, just taking it out 
when he really needed it. 

But the best part was that 
Konigswasser didn't have to sleep ■ 
any more, just because it had to 
sleep; or be afraid any more, just 
because it thought it might get ' 
hurt; or go looking for things it 
seemed to think it had to have. 
And, when it didn't feel well, > 
Konigswasser kept out of it until 
it felt better, and he didn't have \ 
to spend a fortune keeping the j 
thing comfortable. 

When he got his body out of 
the closet to write, he did a book 
on how to get out of one's own 
body, which was rejected without 
comment by twenty-three publishers. The twenty-fourth sold 
two million copies, and the book 
changed human life more than 
the invention of fire, numbers, the 
alphabet, agriculture, or the 
wheel. When somebody told Ko


102

nigswasser that, he snorted that 
they were damning his book with 
faint praise. I'd say he had a 
point there. 

By following the instructions 
in Konigswasser's book for about 
two years, almost anybody could 
get out of his body whenever he 
wanted to. The first step was to 
understand what a parasite and 
dictator the body was most of 
the time, then to separate what 
the body wanted or didn't want 
from what you yourself — your 
psyche — wanted or didn't want. 
Then, by concentrating on what 
you wanted, and ignoring as 
much as possible what the body 
wanted beyond plain maintenance, you made your psyche 
demand its rights and become 
self-sufficient. 

That's what Konigswasser had 
done without realizing it, until 
he and his body had parted company in the park, with his psyche 
going to watch the lions eat, and 
with his body wandering out of 
control into the lagoon. 

The \ final trick of separation, 
once your psyche grew independent enough, was to start your 
body walking into some direction 
and suddenly take your psyche 
off in j another direction. You 
couldn'^ do it standing still,, for 
some reason — you had to walk. 

At first, Madge's and my 
psyches were clumsy at getting 
along outside our bodies, like the 



first sea animals that got stranded on land millions of years ago, 
and who could just waddle and 
squirm and gasp in the mud. But 
we became better at it with time, 
because the psyche can naturally 
adapt so much faster than the 
body. 

T1/|"ADGE and I had good reason for wanting to get out. 
Everybody who was crazy 
enough to try to get out at the 
first had good reasons. Madge's 
body was sick and wasn't going 
to last a lot longer. With her 
going in a little while, I couldn't 
work up enthusiasm for sticking 
around much longer myself. So 
we studied Konigswasser's book 
and tried to get Madge out of her 
body before it died. I went along 
with her, to keep either one of us 
from getting lonely. And we just 
barely made it — six weeks before her body went all to pieces. 

That's why we get to march 
every year in the Pioneers' Day 
Parade. Not everybody does — only the first five thousand of 
us who turned amphibious. We 
were guinea pigs, without much 
to lose one way or another, and 
we were the ones who proved to 
the rest how pleasant and safe it 
was — a heck of a lot safer than 
taking chances in a body year 
in and year out. 

Sooner or later, almost everybody had a good reason for giving 



104 




 



it a try. There got to be millions 
and finally more than a billion 
of us — invisible, insubstantial, 
indestructible, and, by golly, 
true to ourselves, no trouble to 
anybody, and not afraid of anything. 

When we're not in bodies, the 
Amphibious Pioneers can meet 
on the head of a pin. When we 
get into bodies for the Pioneers' 
Day Parade, we take up over 
fifty thousand square feet, have 
to gobble more than three tons 
of food to get enough energy to 
march; and lots of us catch colds 
or worse, and get sore because 
somebody's body accidentally 
steps on the heel of somebody 
else's body, and get jealous because some bodies get to-lead and 
others have to stay in ranks, and 
— oh, hell, I don't know what all. 

I'm not crazy about the parade. 
With all of us there, close together in bodies — well, it brings 
out the worst in us, no matter 
how good our psyches are. Last 
year, for instance, Pioneers' Day 
was a scorcher. People couldn't 
help being out of sorts, stuck in 
sweltering, thirsty bodies for 
hours. 

Well, one thing led to another, 
and the Parade Marshal offered 
to beat the daylights out of my 
body with his body, if my body 
got out of step again. Naturally, 
being Parade Marshal, he had 
the best body that year, except 



for Konigswasser's cowboy, but I 
told him to soak his fat head, 
anyway. He swung, and I ditched 
my body right there, and didn't 
even stick around long enough 
to find out if he connected. He 
had to haul my body back to the 
storage center himself. 

I stopped being mad at him 
the minute I got out of the body. 
I understood, you see. Nobody 
but a saint could be really sympathetic or intelligent for more 
than a few minutes at a time in 
a body — or happy, either, except in short spurts. I haven't 
met an amphibian yet who wasn't 
easy to get along with, and cheerful and. interesting — as long as 
he was outside a body. And I 
haven't met one yet who didn't 
turn a little sour when he got 
into one. 

The minute you get in, chemistry takes over — glands making you excitable or ready to 
fight or hungry or mad or affectionate, or — well you never 
know what's going to happen 
next. 

rpHAT'S why I can't get sore 
at the enemy, the people who 
are against the amphibians. They 
never get out of their bodies and 
won't try to learn. They don't 
want anybody else to do it, either, ' 
and they'd like to make the amphibians get back into bodies and 
stay in them.

After the tussle I had with the 
Parade Marshal, Madge got wind 
of it and left her body right in 
the middle of the Ladies' Auxiliary. And the two of us, feeling 
full of devilment after getting 
shed of the bodies and the parade, went over to have a look 
at the enemy. 

I'm never keen on going over 
to look at them. Madge likes to 
see what the women are wearing.. 
Stuck with their bodies all the 
time, the enemy women change 
their clothes and hair and cosmetic styles a lot oftener than 
we do on the women's bodies in 
the storage centers. 

I don't get much of a kick out 
of the fashions, and almost everything else you see and hear in 
enemy territory would bore a 
plaster statue into moving away. 

Usually, the enemy is talking 
about old-style reproduction, 
which is the clumsiest, most comical, most inconvenient thing anyone could imagine, compared 
with what the amphibians have 
in that line. If they aren't talking about that, then they're talking about food, the gobs of 
chemicals they have to stuff into 
their bodies. Or they'll talk about 
fear, which we. used to call politics — job politics, social politics, 
government politics. 

The enemy hates that, having 
us able to peek in on them any 
time we want to, while they can't 



ever see us unless we get into 
bodies. They seem to be scared 
to death of us, though being 
scared of amphibians makes as 
much sense as being scared of 
the sunrise. They could have the 
whole world, except the storage m 
centers, for all the amphibians 
care. But they bunch together as 
though we were going to come 
whooping out of the sky and do 
something terrible to them at any 
moment. 

They've got contraptions all 
over the place that are supposed 
to detect amphibians. The gadgets aren't worth a nickel, but 
they seem to make the enemy 
feel good — like they were lined 
up against great forces, but keep-' 
ing their nerve and doing important, clever things about it. 
Knowhow — all the time they're 
patting each other about how 
much knowhow they've got, and 
about how we haven't got anything by comparison. If knowhow 
means weapons, they're dead 
right. 

I guess there is a war on between them and us. But we 
never do anything about holding 
up our side of the war, except 
to keep our parade sites and our 
storage centers secret, and to get 
out of bodies every time there's 
an air raid, or the enemy fires a 
rocket, or something. 

That just makes the enemy 



106 




 



madder, because the raids and 
rockets and all cost plenty, and 
blowing up things nobody needs 
anyway is a poor return on the 
taxpayer's money. We always 
know what they're going to do 
next, and when and where, so 
there isn't any trick to keeping 
out of their way. 

But they are pretty smart, considering they've got bodies to 
look after besides doing their 
thinking, so I always try to be 
cautious when I go over to watch 
them. That's why I wanted to 
clear out when Madge and I saw 
a storage center in the middle of 
one of their fields. We hadn't 
talked to anybody lately about 
what the enemy was up to, and 
the center looked awfully suspicious. 

Madge was optimistic, the way 
she's been ever since she borrowed that burlesque queen's body, 
and she said the storage center 
was a sure sign that the enemy 
had seen the light, that they were 
getting ready to become amphibious themselves. 

Well, it looked like it. There 
was a brand-new center, stocked 
with bodies and open for business, 
as innocent as you please. We circled it several times, and Madge's 
circles got smaller and smaller, 
as she tried to get a close look 
at what they had in the way of 
ladies* ready-to-wear. 

"Let's beat it," I said. 



"I'm just looking," said Madge. 
"No harm in looking." 

Then she saw what was in the 
main display case, and she forgot 
where she was or where she'd 
come from. 

The most striking woman's 
body I'd ever seen was in the 
case — six feet tall and built like 
a goddess. But that wasn't the 
payoff. The body had coppercolored skin, chartreuse hair and 
fingernails, and a gold lame evening gown. Beside that body was 
the body of a blond, male giant 
in a pale blue field marshal's uniform, piped in scarlet, and spangled with medals. 

I think the enemy must have 
swiped the bodies in a raid on 
one of our outlying storage centers, and padded and dyed them, 
and dressed them up. 

"Madge, come back!" I said. 

The copper-colored woman 
with the chartreuse hair moved. 
A siren screamed and soldiers 
rushed from hiding places to grab 
the body Madge was in. 

The center was a trap for amphibians! 

The body Madge hadn't been 
able to resist had its ankles tied 
together, so Madge couldn't take 
the few steps she had to take if 
she was going to get out of it 
again. 

The soldiers carted her off triumphantly as a prisoner of war. 
I got into the only body avail

107 



able, the fancy field marshal, to 
try to help her. It was a hopeless 
situation, because the field marshal was bait, too, with its ankles 
tied. The soldiers dragged me after Madge. 

' | iHE cocky young major in 
charge of the soldiers did a 
jig along the shoulder of the road, 
he was so proud. He was the first 
man ever to capture an amphibian, which was really something 
from the enemy's point of view. 
They'd been at war with us for 
years, and spent God knows how 
many billions of dollars, but 
catching us was the first thing 
that made any amphibians pay 
much attention to them. 

When we got to the town, people were leaning out of windows 
and waving their flags, and cheering the soldiers, and hissing 
Madge and me. Here were all the 
people who didn't want to be 
amphibious, who thought it was 
terrible for anybody to be amphibious — people of all colors, 
shapes, sizes, and nationalities, 
joined together to fight the amphibians. 

It turned out that Madge and 
I were going to have a big trial. 
After being tied up every which 
way in jail all night, we were 
taken to a court room, where television cameras stared at us. 

Madge and I were worn to frazzles, because neither one of us 



had been cooped up in a body 
that long since I don't know 
when. Just when we needed to 
think more than we ever had, in 
jail before the trial, the bodies 
developed hunger pains and we 
couldn't get them comfortable on 
the cots, no matter how we tried; 
and, of course, the bodies just 
had to have their eight hours 
sleep. 

The charge against us was a 
capital offense on the books of 
the enemy — desertion. As far 
as the enemy was concerned, the 
amphibians had all turned yellow 
and run out on their bodies, just 
when their bodies were needed to 
do brave and important things 
for humanity. 

We didn't have a hope of being 
acquitted. The only reason there 
was a trial at all was that it gave 
them an opportunity to sound 
off about why they were so right 
and we were so wrong. The court 
room was jammed with their big 
brass, all looking angry and brave 
and noble. 

"Mr. Amphibian," said the 
prosecutor, "you are old enough, 
aren't you, to remember when all 
men had to face up to life in their 
bodies, and work and fight for 
what they believed in?" 

"I remember when the bodies 
were always getting into fights, 
and nobody seemed to know 
why, or how to stop it," I said 
politely. "The only thing every 


108 




 



body seemed to believe in was 
that they didn't like to fight." 

"What would you say of a soldier who ran away in the face of 
fire?" he wanted to know. 

"I'd say he was scared silly." 

"He was helping to lose the 
battle, wasn't he?" 

"Oh, sure." There wasn't any 
argument on that one. 

"Isn't that what the amphibians have done — run out on the 
human, race in the face of the 
battle of life?" 

"Most of us are still alive, if 
that's what you mean," I said. 

TT was true. We hadn't licked 
death, and weren't sure we 
wanted to, but we'd certainly 
lengthened life something amazing, compared to the span you 
could expect in a body. 

"You ran out on your responsibilities!" he said. 

"Like you'd run out of a burning building, sir," I patiently explained. 

"Leaving everyone else to 
struggle on alone!" 

"They can all get out the same 
door that we got out of. You can 
all get out any time you want to. 
All you do is figure out what you 
want and what your body wants, 
and concentrate on — " 

The judge banged his gavel until I thought he'd split it. Here 
they'd burned every copy of Konigswasser's book they tould 



find, and there I was giving a 
course in how to get out of a 
body over a whole television network. 

"If you amphibians had your 
way," said the prosecutor, "everybody would run out on his responsibilities, and let life and 
progress as we know them disappear completely." 

"Why, sure," I agreed. "That's 
the point." 

"Men would no longer work 
for what they believe in?" he 
challenged. 

"I had a friend back in the old 
days who drilled holes in little 
square thingamajigs for seventeen years in a factory, and he 
never did get a very clear idea 
of what they were for. Another 
one I knew grew raisins for a 
glassblowing company, and the 
raisins weren't for anybody to 
eat, and he never did find out 
why the company bought them. 
Things like that make me sick — 
now that I'm in a body, of course 
— and what I used to do for a 
living makes me even sicker." 

"Then you despise human beings and everything they do," he 
said. 

"I like them fine — better. than 
I ever did before. I just think it's 
a dirty shame what they have to 
do to take care of their bodies. 
You ought to get amphibious and 
see how happy people can be 
when they don't have to worry 



UNREADY TO WEAR 



109 



about where their body's next 
meal is coming from, or how to 
beep it from freezing in the wintertime, or what's going to happen to them when their body 
wears out." 

"And that, sir, means the end 
of ambition, the end of greatness!" 

"Oh, I don't know about that," 
I said. "We've got some pretty 
great people on our side. They'd 
be great in or out of bodies. It's 
the end of fear is what it is." I 
looked right into the lens of the 
•nearest television camera. "And 
that's the most wonderful thing 
that ever happened to people." 

Down came the judge's gavel 
again, and the brass started to 
shout me down. The television 
men turned off their cameras 
frantically, and all the spectators, 
except for the biggest brass, were 
cleared out. I knew I'd really 
said something. All anybody 
would be getting on his television 
set now was organ music. 

When the confusion died down, 
the judge said the trial was over, 
and that Madge and I were guilty of desertion. 

NOTHING I could do could 
get us in any worse, so I 
talked back. 

"Now I understand you poor 
fish," I said. "You couldn't get 
along without fear. That's the 
only skill you've got — how to 



scare yourselves and other people ' 
into doing things. That's the only j 
fun you've got, watching people *| 
jump for fear of what you'll do 
to their bodies or take away from 
their bodies." 1 

Madge got in her two cents'^ 
worth. "The only way you can 
get any response from anybody 
is to scare them." 

"Contempt of court!" said the 
judge. i 

"The only way you can scare 
people is if you can keep them 
in their bodies," I told him. 

The soldiers grabbed Madge * 
and me and started to drag us 
out of the court room. 

"This means war!" I yelled. I 

Everything stopped right there J 
and the place got very quiet. \ 

"We're already at war," said j 
a general uneasily. j 

"Well, we're not," I answered, \ 
"but we will be, if you don't un- ' 
tie Madge and me this instant." • 
I was fierce and impressive in j 
that field marshal's body. 

"You haven't any weapons," ) 
said the judge, "no knowhow. 
Outside of bodies, amphibians are 
nothing." 

"If you don't cut us loose by 
the time I count ten," I told him, ! 
"the amphibians will occupy the 
bodies of the whole kit and caboodle of you and march you 
right off the nearest cliff. The 
place is surrounded." That was j 
hogwash, of course. Only one per

son can occupy a body at a time, 
but the enemy couldn't be sure 
of that. "One! Two! Three!" 

The general swallowed, turned 
white, and waved his hand vaguely. 

"Cut them loose," he said 
weakly. 

The soldiers, terrified, too, were 
glad to do it. Madge and I were 
freed. » 

I took a couple of steps, headed my spirit in another direction, 
and that beautiful field marshal, 
medals and all, went crashing 
down the staircase like a grandfather clock. 

I realized that Madge wasn't 
with me. She was still in that copper-colored body with the chartreuse hair and fingernails. 

"What's more," I heard her 
saying, "in payment for all the 
trouble you've caused us, this 
body is to be addressed to me 
at New York, delivered in good 
condition no later than next 
Monday." 

"Yes, ma'am," said the judge. 

WHEN we got home, the Pioneers' Day Parade was just 
breaking up at the local storage 
center, and the Parade Marshal 
got out of his body and apologized to me for acting the way he 
had. 

"Heck, Herb," I said, "you 
don't need to apologize. You 
weren't yourself. You were para


ding around in a body." 

That's the best part of being 
amphibious, next to not being 
afraid — people forgive you for 
whatever fool thing you might 
have done in a body. 

Oh, there are drawbacks, I 
guess, the way there are drawbacks to everything. We still 
have to work off and on, maintaining the storage centers and 
getting food to keep the community bodies going. But that's 
a small drawback, and all the big 
drawbacks I ever heard of aren't 
real ones, just old-fashioned 
thinking by people who can't stop 
worrying about things they used 
to worry about before they turned amphibious. 

As I say, the oldsters will 
probably never get really used 
to it. Every so often, I catch myself getting gloomy over what 
happened to the pay-toilet business it took me thirty years to 
build. 

But the youngsters don't have 
any hangovers like that from the 
past. They don't even worry 
much about something happening 
to the storage centers, the way 
us oldsters do. 

So I guess maybe that'll be 
the next step in evolution — to 
break clean like those first amphibians who crawled out of the 
mud into the sunshine, and who 
never did go back to the sea.
