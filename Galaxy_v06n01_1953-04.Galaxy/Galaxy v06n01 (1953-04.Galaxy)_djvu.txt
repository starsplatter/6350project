COMMON SENSE (II) 



WITH a few ill-chosen 
words in the January 
editorial called "Common Sense," I unwittingly bumped into a nest that the most 
truculent hornet would be proud 
to belong to. 

I said we are not faced by the 
threat of real inflation. 

The reaction was so instantaneous and violent that one would 
think the danger of inflation is 
necessary to our sacred institutions. That's not how I see it. I 
sense a fear of losing a fear, perhaps for fear that the eradicated 
fear will leave room for another 
and possibly more terrible fear. 

If that's so, then I probably 
have no right trying to alleviate 
what strikes me as a needless 
anxiety. But our era is confronted 
by so many real ones that it 
seems to me the removal of unreal fears should release energy 
to tackle genuine problems. 

Here is what I was guilty of 
saying : 

"Inflation is a sudden and disastrous gap between the cost of 
living and income. If income 
keeps pace with rising prices, the 
result is a decline in the purchasing power of money, but it 
is not inflation . . . 

"It doesn't matter whether 
steak cost 10c or $1000 a pound. 



If wages are $1000 an hour, it 
won't stay at 10c a pound. If 
they're 10c an hour, $1000 a 
pound is cataclysmic. But 10c 
an hour and 10c a pound and 
$1000 an hour and $1000 a pound 
are equal." 

Let's be even blunter: they are 
exactly equal, which may be unorthodox economics, but it's a 
good statement of relativity. It 
isn't for or against; it's just the 
seemingly reckless truth that the 
height or depth of wages and 
prices is less important than the 
gap between them. 

I don't see evidence of any 
such gap. As long as there is 
none, inflation is not a menace. 

Let's not confuse individual 
distress with general disaster. 
Persons and groups with fixed 
incomes are being pressed hard, 
no doubt of it. I didn't need the 
news item one reader sent in, 
headlined "High Prices Force 
Worker onto Relief," to convince 
me; we can all supply affidavits. 

But true inflation, which I, 
along with anyone else who went 
overseas in World War II, saw 
in full tornado destructiveness, 
doesn't . merely press hard. It 
pauperizes. Savings are wiped 
out. Insurance and other investments become trash. Only goods

COMMON SENSE (II)

IN U.S.A. By J. T. M'INTOSH 



She couldn't keep the truth from him and he 
couldn't keep the truth from the world— and 
so began the strangest divorce trial ever! 



NOT a soul watched as 
Roderick Liffcom carried his bride across the 
threshold. They were just a couple of nice, good-looking kids — 
Roderick a psychologist and Alison an ex-copy-writer. They 
weren't news yet. There was 
nothing to hint that in a few 

Illustrated by EMSH 




MADE 



days the name of Liffcom would 
be known to almost everyone in 
the world, the tag on a case 
which interested everybody. Not 
everyone would follow a murder 
case, a graft case, or an espionage 
case. But everyone would follow 
the Liffcom case. 

Let's have a good look at them 
while we have the chance, before 
the mobs surround them. Roderick was big and strong enough 
to treat his wife's 115 pounds 
with contempt, but there was no 
contempt in the way he held her. 
He carried her as if she were a 
million dollars in small bills and 
there was a strong wind blowing. 
He looked down at her with his 
heart in his eyes. He had black 
hair and brown eyes and one 
could see at a glance that he could 
have carried any girl he liked over 
the threshold. 

Alison nestled in his arms like 
a kitten, eyes half -closed with 
rapture, arms about his neck. 
She was blonde and had fantastically beautiful eyes, not to mention the considerable claims to 
notice of her other features. But 
even at first glance one would 
know that there was more to Alison than beauty. It might be 
brains, or courage, or hard, bitter 
experience that had tempered her 
keen as steel. One could see at a 
glance that she could have been 
carried over the threshold by 
any man she liked. 



As they went in, it was the end 
of a story. But let's be different 
and call it the beginning. 

TN the morning, when they were 
-* - at breakfast on the terrace, 
the picture hadn't changed radically. That is, Roderick was 
rather different, blue-chinned and 
sleepy-eyed and in a brown 
flannel bathrobe, and Alison was 
more spectacularly different in 
a pale green negligee that wasn't 
so much worn as wafted about. 
But the way they looked at each 
other hadn't changed remotely — 
then. 

"There's something," remarked 
Alison casually, tracing patterns 
on the damask tablecloth with 
one slim finger, "that perhaps I 
ought to tell you." 

Two minutes later they were 
fighting for the phone. 

"I want to call my lawyer," 
Roderick bellowed. 

"I want to call my lawyer," 
Alison retorted. 

He paused, the number half 
dialed. "You can't," he told her 
roughly. "It's the same lawyer." 

She recovered herself first, as 
she always had. She smiled sunnily. "Shall we toss a coin for 
him?" she suggested. 

"No," said Roderick brutally. 
Where, oh, where was his great 
blinding love? "He's mine. I pay 
him more than you ever could." 

"Right," agreed Alison. "I'll 



6 



G A L A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



fight the case myself." 

"So will I," Roderick exclaimed, and slammed the receiver 
down. Instantly he picked it up 
again. "No, we'll need him to get 
things moving." 

"Collusion?" asked Alison 
sweetly. 

"It was a low, mean, stinking, 
dirty, cattish, obscene, disgusting, filthy-minded thing to wait 
until . . ." 

"Until what?" Alison asked 
with more innocence than one 
would have thought there was 
in the world. 

"Android!" he spat viciously at 
her. 

Despite herself, her eyes flashed 
with anger. 

II 

THE newspapers not only mentioned it, they said it at the 
top of their voices: human sues 

ANDROID FOR DIVORCE. It wasn't 

much of a headline, for one naturally wondered why a human 
suing an android for divorce 
should rate a front-page story. 
After all, half the population of 
the world was android. Every 
day humans divorced humans, 
humans androids, androids humans, and androids androids. 
The natural reaction to a headline like that was: "So what? 
Who cares?" 

But it didn't need particular 



intelligence to realize that there 
must be something rather special 
about this case. 

The report ran: "Everton, 
Tuesday. History is made today 
in the first human vs. android 
divorce case since the recent 
grant of full legal equality to 
androids. It is also the first case 
of a divorce sought on the 
grounds that one contracting 
party did not know the other was 
an android. This became possible only because the equality 
law made it no longer obligatory 
to disclose android origin in any 
contract. 

"Recognizing the importance of 
this test case, certain to affect 
millions in the future, Twentyfour Hours will cover the case, 
which opens on Friday, in meticulous detail. Ace reporters 
Anona Geier and Walter Hallsmith will bring to our readers 
the whole story of this historic 
trial. Grier is human and Hallsmith android . . ." 

The report went on to give 
such details as the names of the 
people in this important test case, 
and remarked incidentally that 
although the Liffcom marriage 
had lasted, only ten hours and 
thirteen minutes before the divorce plea was entered, there had * 
been even briefer marriages recorded. 

Twenty-four Hours thus 
adroitly obviated thousands of

letters asking breathlessly: "Is 
this a record?" 

Ill 

A LISON, back at her bachelor 
flat, stretched herself on a 
divan, focused her eyes past the 
ceiling on infinity, and thought 
and thought and thought. 

She wasn't ^particularly unhappy. Not for Alison were misery and resentment and wild, 
impossible hope. She met the 
tragedy of her life *with placid 
resignation and even humor. 

"Let's face it," she told herself 
firmly, "I'm hurt. I hoped he'd 
say, 'It doesn't matter. What 
difference could that make? It's 
you I love' — the sort of thing 
men say in love stories. But what 
did he say? Dirty android." 

Oh, well. Life wasn't like love 
stories or they wouldn't just be 
stories. 

She might as well admit for a 
start that she still loved him. 
That would clarify her feelings. 

She should have told him 
earlier that she was an android. 
Perhaps he had some excuse for 
believing she merely waited until non-consummation was no 
longer grounds for divorce, and 
then triumphantly threw the fact 
that she was an android in his 
lap. (But what good was that 
supposed to do her?) 

It wasn't like that at all, of 



course. She hadn't told him because they had to get to know 
each other before the question 
arose. One didn't say the moment one was introduced to a 
person: "I'm married," or "I 
once served five years for theft," 
or "I'm an android. Are you?" 

If in the first few weeks she 
had known Roderick, some remark had been made about androids, she'd have remarked that 
she was one herself. But it never 
had. 

When he asked her to marry 
him, she honestly didn't think of 
saying she was an android. There 
were times when it mattered and 
times when it didn't; this seemed 
to be one of the latter. Roderick 
was so intelligent, so liberalminded, and so easygoing (excepf. 
when he lost his temper) that 
she didn't think he would care. 

It never did occur to her that 
he might care. She just mentioned it, as one might say: "I 
hope you don't mind my drinking iced coffee every morning." 
Well, almost. She just mentioned 
it . . . 

And happiness was over. 

Now an idea was growing in 
the sad ripple of her thoughts. 
Did Roderick really want this 
divorce case, after all, or was he 
only trying to prove something? 
Because if he was, she was ready 
to admit cheerfully that it was 
proved. 



8 




 



She wanted Roderick. She 'didn't quite understand what had 
happened — perhaps he would 
take her back on condition that 
he could trample on her face 
first. If so, that was all right. 
She was prepared to let him swear 
at her and rage at androids and 
work off any prejudice and hate 
he might have accumulated 
somehow, somewhere — as long as 
he took her back. 

SHE reached behind her, picked up the telephone and 
dialed Roderick's number. 

"Hello, Roderick," she said 
cheerfully. "This is Alison. No, 
don't hang up. Tell me, why do 
you hate androids?" 

There was such a long silence 
that she knew he was considering 
everything, including the advisability of hanging up without a 
word. It could be said of Roderick that he thought things 
through very carefully before going off half-cocked. 

"I don't -hate androids," he 
barked at last. 

"You've got something against 
android girls, then?" 

"No!" he shouted. "I'm a psychologist. I think comparatively 
straight. I'm not fouled up with 
race hatred and prejudice and 
megalomania and — " 

"Then," said Alison very quietly, "it's just one particular android girl you hate." 



Roderick's voice was suddenly 
quiet, too. "No, Alison. It has 
nothing to do with that. It's just 
. . . children." 

So that was it. Alison's eyes 
filled with tears. That was the 
one thing she could do nothing 
about, the thing she had refused 
even to consider. 

"You really mean it?" she 
asked. "That's not just the case 
you're going to make out?" 

"It's the case I'm going to 
make out," he replied, "and I 
mean it. Trouble is, Alison, you 
hit something you couldn't have 
figured on. Most people want 
children, but are resigned to the 
fact that they're not likely to 
get them. I was one of a family 
of eight. The youngest. You'd 
have thought, wouldn't you, that 
that line was pretty safe? 

"Well, all the others are married. Some have been for a long 
time. One brother and two sisters 
have been married twice. That 
makes a total of seventeen human 
beings, not counting me. And 
their net achievement in the way 
of reproduction is zero. 

"It's a question of family continuity, don't you see? I don't 
think we'djnind if there was one 
child among the lot of us — one 
extension into the future. But 
there isn't, and there's only this 
chance left." 

Alison dropped as close to 
misery as she ever did. She un


MADE IN U.S.A. 



9 



derstood every word ' Roderick 
said and what was behind every 
word. If she ever had a chance 
of having children, she wouldn't 
give it up for one individual or 
love of one individual, either. 

But then, of course, she never 
had it. 

In the silence, Roderick hung 
up. Alison looked down at her 
own beautiful body and for once 
couldn't draw a shadow of complacency or content from looking 
at it. Instead, it irritated her, for 
it would never produce a child. 
What was the use of all the appearance, all the mechanism of 
sex, without its one real function? 

But it never occurred to her to 
give up, to let the suit go undefended. There must be something she could do^ some line 
she could take. Winning the case 
was nothing, except that that 
might be a tiny, unimportant 
part of winning back Roderick. 

IV 

THE judge was a little pompous, and it was obvious from 
the start that under the very considerable power he had under the 
contract-court system, he meant 
to run this case in his own way 
and enjoy it. 

He clasped his hands on the 
bench and looked around the 
packed courtroom happily. He 
made his introductory remarks 



with obvious intense satisfaction 
that at least fifty reporters were 
writing down every word. 

"This has been called an important case," he said, "and it is. 
I could tell you why it is important, but that would not be 
justice. Our starting point must 
be this." He wagged his head in 
solemn glee at the jury. "We 
know nothing." 

He liked that. He said it again. 
"We know nothing. We don't 
know the factors involved. We 
have never heard of androids. 
All this and more, we have to be 
told. We can call on anyone anywhere for evidence. And we must 
make up our minds here and 
now, on what we are told here 
and now, on the rights and 
wrongs of this case — and on nothing else." 

He had stated his theme and 
he developed it. He swooped and 
soared; he shot away out of 
sight and returned like a swift 
raven to cast pearls before swine. 
For, of course, his audience was 
composed of swine. He didn't say 
so or drop the smallest hint to 
that effect, but it wasn't necessary. Only on Roderick and Alison did he cast a fatherly, 
friendly eye. They had given him 
his hour .of glory. They weren't 
swine. 

But Judge Collier was no fool. 
Before he had lost the interest he 
had created, he was back in the 



10 




 



ourtroom, getting things moving. 

"I understand," he said, glancig from Alison to Roderick and 
then back at Alison, which was 
understandable, "that you are 
conducting your own cases. That 
will be a factor tending toward 
informality, which is all to the' 
good. First of all, will you look 
at the jury?" 

Everyone in court looked at 
the jury. The jury looked at each 
other. In accordance with contract-court procedure, Roderick 
and Alison faced each other 
across the room, with the jury 
behind Alison so that they could 
see Roderick full-face and Alison 
in profile, and would know when 
they were lying. 

"Alison Liffcom," said the 
judge, "have you any objection 
to any member of the jury?" 

Alison studied them. They 
were people, no more, no less. 
Careful police surveys produced 
juries that were as near genuine 
random groups as could reasonably be found. 

"No," she said. 

"Roderick Liffcom. Have you 
any objection — " 

"Yes," said Roderick belligerently. "I want to know how 
many of them are androids." 

There was a stir of interest in 
the court. 

So it was really to be a human android battle. 



JUDGE Collier's expression did 
not change. "Out of order," 
he said. "Humans and androids 
are equal at law, and you cannot 
object to any juror because he 
is an android." 

"But this case concerns the 
rights of humans and androids," 
Roderick protested. 

"It concerns nothing of the 
kind," replied the judge sternly, 
"and if your plea is along those 
lines, we may as well forget the 
whole thing and go home. You 
cannot divorce your wife because 
she is an android." 

"But she didn't tell me — " 
"Nor because she didn't tell 
you. No android now is obliged, 
ever, to disclose — " 

"I know all that," said Roderick, exasperated. "Must I state 
the obvious? I never had much 
to do with the law, but I do 
know this — the fact that A equals 
B may cut no ic^, while the fact 
that B equals A may sew the 
whole case up. Okay, I'll state 
the obvious. I seek divorce on 
the grounds that Alison concealed from me until after our marriage her inability to have a 
child." 

It' was the obvious plea, but 
it was still a surprise to some 
people. There was a murmur of 
interest. Now things could move. 
There was something to argue 
about. 

Alison watched Roderick and 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



11 



smiled at the thought that she 
knew him much better than anyone else in the courtroom did. 
Calm, he was dangerous, and he 
was fighting to be calm. And as 
she looked steadily at him, part 
of her was wondering how she 
could upset him and put him off 
stroke, while the other part was 
praying that he would be able to 
control himself and show up well. 

She was asked to take the . 
stand and she did it absently, 
still thinking about Roderick. 
Yes, she contested the divorce. 
No, she didn't deny that the facts 
were as stated. On what grounds 
did she contest the case, then? 

She brought her attention back 
to the matter in hand. "Oh, that's 
very simple. I can put it in — " 
she counted on her fingers — -"nine 
words. How do we know I can't 
have a child?" 

Reporters wrote down the word 
"sensation." It wouldn't have 
lasted, but Alison knew that. She 
piled on more fuel. 

"I'm not stating my whole 
case," she said. "All I'm saying 
at the moment is . . ." She 
blushed. She felt it on her face 
and was pleased with herself. 
She hadn't been sure she could 
do it. "I don't like to speak of 
such things, but I suppose I must. 
When I married Roderick, I was 
a virgin. How could I possibly 
know then that I couldn't have 
a baby?" 



V 

IT took a long- time to get 
things back to normal after 
that. The judge had to exhaust 
himself hammering with his 
gavel and threatening to clear 
the court. But Alison caught 
Roderick's eye, and he grinned 
and shook his head slowly. Roderick was two people, at least. 
He was the hothead, quick to 
anger, impulsive, emotional. But 
he was also, though it was hard 
to believe sometimes, a psychologist, able to sift and weigh and 
classify things and decide what 
they meant. 

She knew what he meant as 
he shook his head at her. She 
had made a purely artificial 
point, effective only for the moment. She knew she was an android and that androids didn't 
have children. The rest was irrelevant. 

"We have now established;" 
the judge was saying, breathless 
from shouting and banging with 
his gavel, "what the case is about 
and some of the facts. Alison 
Liffcom admits that she concealed the fact that she was an 
android, as she was perfectly entitled to do — " He frowned down 
at Roderick, who had risen. 
"Well?" 

Roderick, at the moment, was 
the psychologist. "You mentioned > the word 'android,' Judge. 



12 




 



Have you forgotten that none of 
us knows what an android is? 
You said, I believe: 'We have 
never heard of androids.' " 

Judge Collier clearly preferred 
the other Roderick, whom he 
could squash when he liked. 
"Precisely," he said without enthusiasm. "Do you propose to 
I tell us?" 

"I propose to have you told," 
said Roderick. ~ 

Dr. Geller took the stand. 
Roderick faced him, looking 
calm and competent. Most of the 
audience were women. He knew 
how to make the most of himself, and he did. Dr. Geller, silver-haired, dignified, was as 
impassive as a statue. 

"Who are you, Doctor?" asked 
Roderick coolly. 

"I am director of the Everton 
Creche, where the androids for 
the entire state are made." 

"You know quite a bit about 
androids?" 

"I do." 

"Just incidentally, in case anyone would like to know, do you 
mind telling us whether you are 
human or android?" 

"Not at all. I am an android." 

"I see. Now perhaps you'll tell 
us what androids are, when they 
were first made, and why?" 

"Androids are just people. No 
different from humans except that 
they're made instead of born. I 
take it you don't want me to tell 



you the full details of the process. Basically, one starts with a 
few living cells — that's always 
necessary — and gradually forms 
a complete human body. There is 
no difference. I must stress that. 
An android is a man or a woman, 
not in any sense a robot or automaton." 

There was a stir again, and 
the judge smiled faintly. Roderick's witness looked like something of a burden to Roderick. 
But Roderick merely nodded. 
Everything, apparently, was under control. 

"About two hundred years 
ago," the doctor went on, "it was 
shown beyond reasonable doubt 
that the human race was headed 
for extinction fairly soon. The 
population was halving itself 
every generation. Even if human 
life continued, civilization could 
not be maintained ..." 

It was dull for everybody. 
Even Dr. Geller didn't seem very 
interested in what he was saying. 
This was the part that everyone 
knew already. But the judge 
didn't interfere. It was all strictly 
relevant. 

• 

A T first the androids had only 
been an experiment, interesting because they were from the 
first an astonishingly successful 
experiment. There was little failure, and a lot of startling success. 
Once the secret was discovered, 



MADE IN U. S. A. 



13 



one could, by artificial means, 
manufacture creatures who were 
men and women to the last decimal point. There was only one 
tiny flaw. They couldn't reproduce, either among themselves or 
with human partners. Everything 
was normal except that conception never took place. 

But as the human population 
dropped, and as the public services slowed, became inefficient, 
or closed down, it was natural 
that the bright idea should occur 
to someone: Why shouldn't the 
androids do it? 

So androids were made and 
trained as public servants. At 
first they were lower than the 
beasts. But that, to do humanity 
justice, lasted only until it became clear that androids were 
people. Then androids ascended 
the social scale to the exalted 
level of slaves. The curious thing, 
however, was that there was only 
one way to make androids, and 
that was to make them as babies 
and let them grow up. It wasn't 
possible to make only stupid, 
imperfect, adult androids. They 
turned out like humans, good, 
bad and* indifferent. 

And then came the transformation. Human births took an 
upsurge. It was renaissance. 
There was even unemployment 
for a while again. It would have 
been inhuman, of course, to kill 
off the androids, but on the other 



hand, if anyone was going to 
starve, they might as well. 
They did. 

No more androids were made. 
Human births subsided. Androids were manufactured again. 
Human births rose. 

It became obvious at last. The 
human race had not so much 
been extinguishing itself with 
birth control as actually failing 
to reproduce. Most people, men 
and women, were barren these 
days. But a certain proportion of 
this barrenness was psychological. The androids were a challenge. They stimulated a stubborn 
strain deep in humans. 

So a balance was reached. Androids were made for two reasons 
only — -to have that challenging 
effect that kept the human race 
holding its ground, almost replacing its losses, and to do all the 
dirty work of keeping a juggernaut of an economic system 
functioning smoothly for a decimated population. 

Even in the early days, the 
androids had champions. Curiously enough, it wasn't a matter 
of the androids fighting for and 
winning equality, but of humans 
fighting among each other and 
gradually giving the androids 
equality. 

The humans who fought most 
were those who couldn't have 
children. All these people could 
do if they were to have a family 



14 




 



was adopt baby androids. Naturnlly they lavished on them all the 
uffection and care that their own 
children would have had. They 
came to look on them as their 
own children. They therefore were 
very strongly in favor of any 
move to remove restrictions on 
androids. One's own son or 
daughter shouldn't be treated as 
an inferior being. 

That was some of the story, 
as Dr. Geller sketched it. The 
court was restive, the judge looked at the ceiling, the jury looked 
at Alison. Only Roderick was 
politely attentive to Dr. Geller. 

VI 

VERYONE knew at once 
^ when the lull was over. If 
anyone missed Roderick's question, no one missed the doctor's 
answer: " — reasonably established that androids cannot reproduce. At first there was actually 
some fear that they might. It 
was thought that the offspring of 
android and human would be 
some kind of monster. But reproduction did not occur." 

"Just one more point, Doctor," 
said Roderick easily. "There is, 
I understand, some method of 
identification — some means of 
telling human from android, and 
vice versa?" 

"There are two," replied the 
doctor. Some of the people in 



court looked up, interested. 
Others made their indifference 
obvious to show that they knew 
what was coming. "The first is 
the fingerprint system. It is just 
as applicable to androids as to 
humans, and every android at 
every creche is fingerprinted. If 
for any reason it becomes necessary to identify a person jvho 
may or may not be android" 
prints are taken. Once these have 
been sent to every main android 
center in the world — a process 
which takes only two weeks — the 
person is either positively identified as android or by elimination is known to be human." 

"There is no possibility of error?" 

"There is always the possibility of error. The system is perfect, but to err is human — and, 
if I may be permitted the pleasantry, android as well." 

"Quite," said Roderick. "But 
may we take it that the possibility of error in this case is 
small?" 

"You may. As for the other 
method of identification: this is 
a relic of the early days of android manufacture and many of 
us feel — but that is not germane." 

For the first time, however, he 
looked somewhat uncomfortable 
as he went on: "Androids, of 
course, are not born. There is no 
umbilical cord. The navel is 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



15 



small, even and symmetrical, 
and faintly but quite clearly 
marked inside it are the words — 
in this country, at any rate — 
'Made in U.S.A.'" 

A wave of sniggers ran round 
the court. The doctor flushed 
faintly. There were jokes about 
the little stamp that all androids 
carried. Once there had been political cartoons with the label as 
the motif. The point of one allegedly funny story came when 
it was discovered that a legend 
which was expected to be 'Made 
in U.S.A.' turned out to be 'Fabrique en France' instead. 

IT had always been something 
humans could jibe about, the 
stamp that every android would 
carry on his body to his grave. 
Twenty years ago, all persecution of androids was over, supposedly, and androids were free 
and accepted and had all but the 
same rights as humans. Yet 
twenty years ago, women's evening dress invariably revealed the 
navel, whatever else was chastely 
concealed. Human girls flaunted 
the fact that they were human. 
Android girls either meekly 
showed the proof or, by hiding 
it, admitted they were android. 

"There is under review," said 
the doctor, "a proposal to discontinue what some people feel 
must always be a badge of subservience — " 



"That is sub judice," interrupted the judge, "and no part 
of the matter in question. We 
are concerned with things as they 
are." He looked inquiringly at 
Roderick. "Have you finished 
with the witness?" 

"Not only the witness," said 
Roderick, "but my case." He 
looked so pleased with himself 
that Alison, who was difficult to 
anger, wanted to hit him. "You 
have heard Dr. Geller's evidence. 
I demand that Alison submit 
herself to the two tests he mentioned. When it is established 
that she is an android, it will 
also be established that she cannot have a child. And that she 
therefore, by concealing her android status from me, also concealed the fact that she could not 
have a child." 

The judge nodded somewhat 
reluctantly. He looked over his 
glasses at Alison without much 
hope. It would be a pity if such 
a promising case were allowed 
to fizzle out so soon and so 
trivially. But he personally could 
see nothing significant that Alison could offer in rebuttal. 

"Your witness," said Roderick, 
with a gesture that called for a 
kick in the teeth, or so Alison 
thought. 

"Thank you," she said sweetly. 
She rose from her seat and crossed 
the floor. She wore a plain gray 
suit with a vivid yellow blouse, 



16 




 



only a little of it visible, supplying the necessary touch of color. 
She had never looked better in 
licr life and she knew it. 

Roderick looked as though he 
were losing the iron control 
which he had held for so long 
against all her expectations, and 
•.he did what she could to help 
by wriggling her skirt straight in 
the way he had always found so 
attractive. 

"Stop that!" he hissed at her. 
"This is serious." 

She merely showed him twenty-eight of her perfect teeth, and 
then turned to Dr. Geller. 

VII 

"T WAS most interested in a 
phrase you used, Doctor," 
said Alison. "You said it was 
'reasonably established' that androids could not reproduce. Now 
I take it I have the facts correct. You are director of the 
Everton Creche?" 
"Yes." 

"And your professional experience is therefore confined to androids up to the age of ten?" 

"Yes." 

"Is it usual for even humans," 
asked Alison, "to reproduce before the age of ten?" 

There was stunned silence, 
then a laugh, then applause. 
"This is not a radio show," 
shouted the judge. "Proceed, 



if you please, Mrs. Liffcom." 

Alison did. Dr. Geller was the 
right man to come to for all 
matters relating to young androids, she said apologetically, 
but for matters relating to adult 
androids (no offense to Dr. Geller intended, of course), she 
proposed to call Dr. Smith. 

Roderick interrupted. He was 
perfectly prepared to hear Alison's case, but hadn't they better 
conclude his first? Was Alison 
prepared to submit herself to the 
two tests mentioned? 

"It's unnecessary," said Alison. "I am an android. I am not 
denying it." 

"Nevertheless — " said Roderick. 

"I don't quite understand, Mr. 
Liffcom," the judge put in. "If 
there were any doubt, yes. But 
Mrs. Liffcom is not claiming that 
she is not an android." 

"I want to know." 

"Do you think there is any 
doubt?" 

"I only wish there were." 

It was "sensation" again. 

"And yet it's all perfectly natural, when you consider it," said 
Roderick, when he could be 
heard. "I want a divorce because 
Alison is an android and can't 
have a child. If she's been mistaken, or has been playing some 
game, or whatever it might be, 
I don't want a divorce. I want 
Alison, the girl I married. Surely 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



17 



that's easy enough to understand?" 

"All right," said Alison emotionlessly. "It'll take some time 
to check my fingerprints, but the 
other test can be made now. 
What do I do, Judge, peel here 
in front of everybody?" 

"Great Scott, no!" 

Five minutes later, in the jury 
room, the judge, the jury and 
Roderick examined the proof. 
Alison surrendered none of her 
dignity or self-possession while 
showing it to them. 

There was no doubt. The mark 
of the android was perfectly 
clear. 

Roderick was last to look. 
When he had examined the 
brand, his eyes met Alison's, and 
she had to fight back the tears. 
For he wasn't satisfied or angry, 
only sorry. 

T>ACK in court, Roderick said 
he waived the fingerprint test. 
And Alison called Dr. Smith. He 
was older than Dr. Geller, but 
bright-eyed and alert. There was 
something about him — people 
leaned forward as he took the 
stand, knowing ^somehow that 
what he had to say was going to 
be worth hearing. 

"Following the precedent of 
my learned friend," said Alison, 
"may I ask you if you are human 
or android, Dr. Smith?" 

"You may. I am human. How


ever, most of my pat'ents have 
been android." * 

"Why is that?" 

"Because I realized long ago 
that androids represented the future. Humans are losing the fight. 
That being so, I wanted to find 
out what the differences between 
humans and androids were, or if 
there were any at all. If there 
were none, so much the better — 
the human race wasn't going to 
die out, after all." 

"But of course," said Alison 
casually, yet somehow everyone 
hung on her words, "there ( was 
one essential difference. Humanity was becoming sterile, but 
androids couldn't reproduce." 

"There was no difference," 
said Dr. Smith. 

Sometimes an unexpected 
statement produces silence, sometimes bedlam. Dr. Smith got both 
in turn.. There was the stillness 
of shock as he elaborated and 
put his meaning beyond doubt. 

"Androids can have and have 
had children." 

Then the rest was drowned in 
a wave of gasps, whispers and 
exclamations that swelled in a 
few seconds to a roar. The judge 
hammered and shouted in vain. 

There was anger in the shouts. 
There was excitement, anxiety, 
incredulity, fear. Either the doctor was lying or he wasn't. If he 
was lying, he would suffer for it. 
People tricked by such a hoax 



18 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



are angry, vengeful, people. 

If he wasn't lying, everyone 
must re-evaluate his whole view 
of life. Everyone — human and 
android. The old religious questions would come up again. The 
question would be decided of 
whether Man, himself becoming 
extinct, had actually conquered 
life, instead of merely reaching 
a compromise with it. It would 
cease to matter whether any person was born or made. 

There would be no more androids, only human beings. And 
Man would be master of creation. 

VIII 

THE court sat again after a 
brief adjournment. The judge 
peered at Alison and at Dr. 
Smith, who was again on the 
stand. 

"Mrs. Liffcom," he said, "would 
you care to take up your examination at the same point?" 

"Certainly," said Alison. She 
addressed herself to Dr. Smith. 
"You say that androids can have 
children?" 

This time there was silence 
except for the doctor's quiet 
voice. "Yes. There is, as may well 
be imagined, conflicting evidence 
on this. The evidence I propose 
to bring forward has frequently 
been discredited. The reaction 
when I first made this statement 
shows why. It is an important 



question on which everyone must 
have reached some conclusion. 
Possibly one merely believes 
what one is told." 

As he went on, Alison cast a 
glance at Roderick. At first he 
was indifferent. He didn't believe it. Then he showed mild 
interest in what the doctor was 
saying. Eventually he became so 
excited that he could hardly sit 
still. 

And Alison began to hope 
again. 

"There is *a psychologist in 
court," remarked the doctor 
mildly, "who may soon be asking 
me questions. I am not a psychologist any more than any other 
general practitioner, but before 
I mention particular cases, I 
must make this point. Every android grows up knowing he or 
she cannot have children. That 
is accepted in our civilization. 

"I don't think it should be 
accepted. I'll tell you why." 

No one interrupted him. He 
wasn't spectacular, but he wasted 
no time. 

He mentioned the case of 
Betty Gordon Holbein, 178 years 
before. No one had heard of 
Betty Gordon Holbein. She was 
human, said the doctor. Prostrate with shock, she testified she 
had been raped by an android. 
The android concerned was 
lynched. In due course, Betty 
Holbein had a normal child. 



MADE IN. U.S.A. 



19 



"The records are available to 
everyone," said the doctor. "There 
was a lot of interest and indignation when the girl was 
raped, very little when she had 
her child. The suggestion that 
she had conceived after the incident was denied, without much 
publicity, or belief, for even then 
it was known that androids were 
barren." 

"OODERICK was on his feet. 

He looked at the judge, who 
nodded. 

"Look, are you twisting this 
to make a legal case," he demanded, "or did this girl — " 

"You cannot ask the witness 




if he is perjuring himself," remarked the judge reprovingly. 

"I d on 't a damn about 

perjury!" Roderick exclaimed. 
"I just want to know if this is 
true!" 

It was all very irregular; but 
Alison knew he might explode 
any moment and swear at the 
doctor and the judge. She didn't 
want that. So her eyes met his 
and she said levelly: "It's true, 
Roderick." 

Roderick sat down. 

"Now to get a true picture," 
the doctor continued, "we must 
remember that millions of^ androids were being tested, and 
mating among themselves, and 
even having irregular liaisons 
with humans — and no conception 
took- place. Or did it?" 

A little over a century ago, 
an android girl had been found 
in a wood, alive, but only just. 
Around her there were marks of 
many feet. She had been mutilated. Though she lived, she 
was never quite sane after that. 

But she also had a child. 

Roderick rose again, frowning. 
"I don't understand," he said 
"If this is true, why is it not 
known?" 

The judge was going to intervene, but Roderick went on 
quickly, "The doctor and I art 
professional men. I can ask hin 
for a professional opinion, sure 
ly? Well, Doctor?" 


 



* 



"Because it has always been 
possible to disbelieve what one 
has decided to disbelieve. In this 
case, that nameless woman was 
mutilated so that the navel mark 
would be removed. There was a 
record of her fingerprints as those 
of an android. But it was authoritatively stated that there must 
have been a mistake and that, 
by having a child, the woman 
had thus been proved to be human." 

A century and a half ago, 
Winnie — androids had begun to 
have at least a first name by this 
time — had a child and it was 
again decided that this girl, who 
had been a laundry maid, must 
have been mixed up with an android while a baby and was in 
fact human. 



A little dead baby was found 
buried in a garden and an android couple was actually in 
court over the matter. But since 
they were androids, it could obviously not be their child, and 
they were discharged. 

Roderick jumped up again. 
"If you knew this," he asked Dr. 
Smith, "why keep it secret until 
now?" 

"Five years ago," said the doctor, "I wrote an article on the 
subject. I sent it to all the me'dical journals. Kventually one of 
the smaller publications printed 
it. I had half a dozen letters 
from people who were interested. 
Then nothing more. 

"One must admit," he added, 
"that not one of the cases I have 
mentioned — as reported at the 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



21 



time — would be accepted as positive scientific proof that androids can reproduce. The facts 
were recorded for posterity by 
people who didn't believe them. 
But . . ." 

"But," said Alison, a few 
minutes later, when the doctor 
had finished giving his evidence, 
"in view of this, it can hardly be 
stated that I know I cannot have 
a child. It may be unlikely; shall 
I call more medical evidence to 
show how unlikely, conception is 
for the average human woman?" 

JUDGE Collier said nothing, 
so she continued: "The present 
position, as anyone concerned 
with childbirth would tell you, 
is that few marriages produce 
children, but those that do produce a lot. People who can have 
children go on doing it, these 
days. 

"Now I want to introduce a 
new point. It is not grounds for 
divorce among humans if the woman is barren and is not aware 
of it. It is, on the other hand, 
if she has had an operation which 
makes it impossible for her to 
have children and she conceals 
the fact." 

"I see what you are getting at," 
said the judge, "and it is most 
ingenious. Finish it, please." 

"Having had no such operation," said Alison, "and being 
able to prove it, I understand 



that I can't be held, legally, to 
have known that I could never 
have children." 

"To save reference to case histories," said the judge contentedly, "I can say here and now 
that the lady is right. It is for 
the jury to decide on the merits 
of the case, but Mrs. Liffcom 
may be said to have established—" 

"I demand an adjournment," 
said Roderick. 

There was a low murmur that 
gradually died out. Roderick and 
Alison were both on their feet, 
staring at each other across ten 
yards of space. The intensity of 
their feeling could be felt by 
everyone in the courtroom. 

"Court adjourned until tomor 
row," said the judge hastily. 

IX 

ALMOST every newspaper 
which mentioned the Liffcom case committed contempt of 
court. Perhaps the feeling was 
that no action could be taken 
against so many. All the newspapers went into the rights and 
wrongs of the affair as if they 
were giving evidence, too. Very 
little of the material was pro- or 
anti-android. It was, rather, for 
or against the evidence brought 
up. 

Anyone could see, remarked 
one newspaper bluntly, that Ali


22 




 



■ >n Liffcom was nobody's fool. 
1 1 a woman like that went to 
1 lie trouble of defending a suit 
■ if any kind, she would dig up 
■mething good and play it to 
ic limit. This was no aspersion 
tin the morals or integrity of Mrs. 
1 iff com, for whom the newspaper 
!md the keenest admiration. All 
»he had to do was cast the faintest doubt on the truism that anil roids could not reproduce. She 
had done that. 

But that, of course, said the 

iper decisively, didn't mean 
that ancjroids could. 

Another newspaper took it 
from there. Just as good a case, 
it remarked, could have been 
made out for spiritualism, telepathy, possession, the existence 
of werewolves . . . Dr. Smith, 
who was undoubtedly sincere, 
had been misled by a few mistakes. Obviously, when androids 
were human in all respects save 
one, some humans would be 
passed off or mistaken for androids and vice versa. Equally 
obviously, the mistake would 
only be discovered if and when 
conception occurred, as in the 
cases quoted by Dr. Smith. 

A third paper even offered Alison a point to make in court if 
she liked. True enough, Dr. 
Smith had shown that such mistakes could occur. It was only 
necessary for Alison then to 
quote these cases and stress the 



possibility that the same thing 
might have happened to her. If 
the proof of android origin was 
not proof, the case would collapse. 

Other papers, however, took 
the . view that there might be 
something in the possibility that 
androids could reproduce. Why 
not? asked one. Androids weren't 
bloodless, inferior beings. One 
could keep things warm by holding them against the human body 
— or by building a fire. In the 
same way, children could be 
nurtured in a human body or in 
culture tanks. The results were 
identical. They must be identical 
if one could take them forty 
years later, give them rigorous 
tests, and tell one from the other 
only because the android was 
stamped "Made in U.S.A." and 
because his fingerprints were on 
file. 

People had believed androids 
could not have children because 
they had been told, androids 
never had. Now they were told 
androids had reproduced. Where 
was the difficulty? You believed 
you had finished your cigarettes 
until you took out the pack and 
saw there was one left. What did 
you do then — say you had finished them, therefore that what 
looked like a cigarette wasn't, 
and throw it away? 

And almost all the newspapers, 
whatever their general view, 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



23 



asked the real, fundamental 
question as well. 

That artificially rriade humans 
could conceive was credible, in 
theory. That they could not was 
also credible, in theory. 

But why one in a million, one 
in five million, one in ten million? Even present-day humans 
could average one fertile marriage in six. 

X 

"TF you have no objections," 
said Roderick politely — determined to be on his best be-havior, thought Alison — "let's 
turn this into a court of inquiry. 
Let's say, if you like, that Alison 
has successfully defended the 
case on the grounds that she 
can't legally be said to have 
known she couldn't have a child. 
Forget the divorce. That's not 
the point." 

"I thought it was," the judge 
objected, dazed. 

"Anyone can see that what . 
matters now," said Roderick impatiently, "is what Dr. Smith 
brought up: Let's get down to 
the question of whether there's 
any prospect of Alison having a 
baby." 

"A courtroom is hardly the 
place to settle that," murmured 
Alison. But she felt the first warm 
breath of . a glow of happiness 
she had thought she would never 



be able to experience again. 

"Women always go from the 
general to the particular," Roderick retorted. "I don't mean the 
question of whether you will 
have children. I mean the question of whether it's really possible that you might." . i 

The judge rapped decisively. I 
have been too lenient. I insist on, 
having a certain amount of order 
in my own court. Roderick Liff-. 
com, do you withdraw your 
suit?" 

"What does it matter? Anyway, if you must follow^that line, j 
we'd have to have a few straight I 
questions and answers like 
whether Alison still loves me." 

The judge gasped. j 

"Do you?" demanded Roder- J 
ick, glaring at Alison. 1 

Alison felt as if her heart was 
going to explode. "If you want a 
straight answer," she said, "yes." 

"Good," said Roderick with 
satisfaction. "Now we can go on 
from there." 

He turned to glower at Judge 
Collier, who was trying to interrupt. 

"Look here," Roderick de T 
manded, "are you interested in ' 
getting at the truth?" 

"Certainly, but — " 

"So am I. Be quiet, then. I 
meant to keep my temper with 
you, but you're constantly getting in my hair. Alison, would 
you mind taking the stand?" 



24 




 



There was no doubt that Rod■ k had personality. 

With Alison on the stand, he 
' tied to the jury. "I'll tell you 
it I have in mind," he told 
m in friendly fashion. "We all 
ider why, if this thing's posi<\ it's happened so seldom, 
i 1 1 1 fortunately, to date there 
Iwtsn't been any real admission 
• 1 >t it is possible,, so I didn't 
now. I never had a chance to 
work on it. Now I have. What I 
wnnt to know is, if androids can 
I ive children, what prevents 
in' m from doing so." 

He reached out absently, without looking around, and squeezed 
Alison's shoulder. "We've got Ali•ion here," Roderick went on. 
"Let's find out if we can, shall 
we, what would stop her from 
having children?" 

Alison was glad she was sitting 
down. Her knees felt so weak 
that she knew they wouldn't support her. Did she have Roderick 
back or didn't she? Could she 
really have a baby? Roderick's 
baby? The court swam dizzily in 
front of her eyes. 

Only gradually did she become 
aware of Roderick's voice asking 
anxiously if she was all right, 
Roderick bending over her, Roderick's arm behind her back, supporting her. 

"Yes," she said faintly. "I'm 
sorry. Roderick, I'll help you all 
I can, but do you think there's 



really very much chance?" 

"I'm a psychologist," he reminded her quietly, "and since 
you've never seen me at work, 
there's no harm in telling you I'm 
pretty good. Maybe we won't 
work this out here in half an 
hour, but we'll get through it in 
the next sixty years." 

Alison didn't forget where she 
was, but everything was so crazy 
that a little more wouldn't hurt. 
She reached up and drew his 
lips down to hers.

"W/"HAT I'm locking for must 
be in the life of every android, male and female," said 
Roderick. "I don't expect to find 
it right away. Just tell us, Alison, 
about any times when you were 
aware of distinction — when you 
were made aware that you were 
an android, not a human. Start 
as early as you like. 

"And," hie added with a sudden, unexpected grin, "please address your remarks to the judge. 
Let's keep this as impersonal as 
we can." 

Alison composed her mind for 
, the job. She didn't really want 
to look back. She wanted to look 
into the new, marvelous future. 
But she forced herself to begin. 

"I grew up in the New York 
Android Creche," she said. 
"There was no distinction there. 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



25 



Sorne of the children thought 
there was. Sometimes I heard 
older children talking about how 
much better off they would be 
if they were humans. But twice 
when there was overcrowding in 
the creche and plenty of room 
at the orphanage for human children, I was moved to the orphanage. And there was absolutely no 
difference. 

"In a creche, it's far more important to be able to sell yourself than it ever can be later. If 
you're attractive or appealing 
enough, someone looking for a 
child to adopt will notice you and 
you'll have a home and security 
and affection. I wasn't attractive 
or appealing. I stayed in the 
creche until I was nine. I saw so 
many couples looking for children, always taking away some 
child but never me, that I was 
sure I would stay there until I 
was too old to be adopted and 
then have to earn my living, 
always on my own. 

"Then, one day, one of the 
sisters at the creche found me 
crying — I forget what I was crying about — and told me there was 
no need for me to cry about anything because I had brains and , 
" I was going to be a beauty, and 
what more could any girl want? 
I looked in the mirror, but I still 
seemed the same as ever. She 
must have known what she was 
talking about, though, for just 



a week later, a couple came 
and looked around the creche and 
picked me." 

Alison took a deep breath, and 
there was no acting about the 
tears in her eyes. 

"Nobody who's never experienced it can appreciate what it 
is to have a home for the first 
time at the age of nine," she 
said. "To say I'd have died for 
my new parents doesn't tell half 
of it. Maybe this is something 
that misled Roderick. He knew 
that twice a month, at least, I go 
and see my folks. He must hav 
thought they were my real parents, so he didn't ask if I was 
android." 

She looked at Roderick for 
the first time since she started 
the story. He nodded. 

"Go on, Alison," he said quietly. "You're doing fine." 

"This isn't a hard world for 
androids," Alison insisted. "It's 
only very occasionally . . ." 

She stopped, and Roderick had 
to prompt her. "Only very occasionally that what?" 

But Alison wasn't with him. 
She was eleven years back in the 
past. 

XII 

ALISON had known all about 
that awkward period when 
she would cease to be a child and 
become a woman. But she had 



26 




 



e ver quite realized how rapid it 
■ >uld be, and how it would seem 
vi-n more rapid, so that it was 
vcr before she was ready for it to 
lurt. 

She wasn't sleeping well, but 
lie was so healthy and had such 
< serves of strength that it didn't 
how, and for once her adopted 
i >arents failed her. Though Alison 
vould never admit that, it would 
:ive been so much easier if Sutn had talked with her, and 
Koger, without saying a word, 
1 1 ad indicated in his manner that 
uc knew what was going on. 

One day she was out walking, 
trying to tire herself for sleep 
later, and ran into a group of 
youths of her own age in the 
woods. She knew one of them 
slightly, Bob Thomson, and she 
knew that their apparent leader, 
as tall as a man at fifteen, was 
Harry Hewitt. She didn't know 
whether any of them were androids or not — the question had 
never occurred to her. And it 
didn't seem of any immediate interest or importance that she was 
an android, either, as she passed 
through them and some of them 
whistled, and involuntarily, completely aware of their eyes on 
her, she reddened. 

She saw Bob Thomson whisper 
to Harry Hewitt and Hewitt 
burst out: "Android,, eh? Android! That's fine!" He stepped 
in front of her and barred her 



path. "What a pretty android," 
he said loudly, playing to his 
gallery. "I've seen you before, 
but I thought you were just a 
girl. Take off your blouse, android." 

There was a startled movement in the group, and someone 
nudged Hewitt. 

"It's all right," he said. "She's 
an android. No real parents, only 
people who have taken her in to 
pretend they can have kids." 

Alison looked from side to side 
like a cornered animal. 

"Humans can do anything they 
like with androids," Hewitt told 
his more timorous companions. 
"Don't you know that?" He 
turned back to Alison. "But we 
must be sure she is an android. 
Hold her, Butch." 

Alison was grasped firmly by 
the hips, which had so recently 
stopped being boyish and swelled 
alarmingly. She kicked and 
struggled, her heart threatening 
to burst, but Butch, whoever he 
was, was strong. Two other boys 
held her arms. Carefully, to a 
chorus of nervous, excited sniggers, Hewitt parted her blouse 
and skirt a narrow slit and peered 
at her navel. 

"Made in U.S.A.," he said with 
satisfaction. "It's all right, then." 

In contrast to his previous cautious, decorous manner, he tore 
the blouse out of her waistband 
and ripped it off. Alison's knees 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



27 



sagged as someone behind her 
began to fumble with her brassiere. 

"No, no!" Hewitt exclaimed in 
mock horror. "Mustn't do that 
until she says you can. Even 
androids have rights. Or at least, 
if they haven't, we should be 
polite and pretend they have. 
Android, say we can do whatever 
we like with you." 

"No!" cried Alison. 

"That's too bad. Shift your 
grip a bit, Butch." 

The rough hands went up 
around her ribs, rasping her soft 
skin. 

Alison struggled and twisted 
wildly. 

"Keep still," said Hewitt. He 
spoke very quietly, but there was 
savage joy in his face. Slowly 
and carefully, he loosened Alison's belt and eased her skirt and 
the white trunks under it down to 
the pit of her stomach. Then he 
took out a heavy clasp- knife, 
opened it and set the point neatly 
in the center of her belly. Alison 
drew in her stomach; the knife* 
point followed, indenting the 
flesh. 

"Say we can do whatever we 
like with you, android." 

The knife pricked deeper. A 
tiny drop of crimson came from 
under it and ran slowly down to 
Alison's skirt. Her nerve broke. 

"You can do whatever you like 
with me!" she screamed. 



HER brassiere came loose and 
fluttered to the ground. Hewitt's knife cut her belt and her 
skirt began to slip over her hips. 
Butch's hands went down to her 
waist again, biting into it cruelly. 
From behind, a hand tentatively 
touched her breast and another 
clutched her shoulder. One at a 
time, her feet were raised and 
the shoes taken off them and 
thrown in the bushes. 

But someone else had heard 
Alison's scream. Long after she 
had thought no one would 
come, someone did. 

"Hell," said Hewitt as one of 
his companions shouted and 
pointed, "something always spoils 
everything. Beat it, boys." 

They were gone. Alison clutched her skirt and looked behind her 
thankfully. A man and a woman 
were only a few yards from her. 
The woman was young and 
heavy with child. Humans, both 
of them. She opened her mouth 
to thank them, to explain, to 
weep. 

But they were looking at her 
as if she were a crushed beetle 
of some kind. 

"Android, of course," said the 
man disgustedly. "Dirty little 
beast." 

"Hardly more than a child," 
the woman said, "and already at 
this." 

"I think I'll give her a good 
hiding," the man went on. 



28 




 



"Won't do any good, I suppose, 
>>ut ..." 

Alison burst into tears and 
darted among the bushes. She 
didn't wait to see whether the 
man started after her. Branches 
and thorns tore her skin. Her 
skirt dropped and tripped her. 
She flew headlong, flinched away 
from a thorny bush, slammed 
hard into a tree-trunk, and waited 
on the ground, sick and breathless, for the man to beat her. • 

Her legs and arms and shoulders were covered with long 
scratches and a wiry branch had 
lashed her ribs like a whip, leaving a long weal. But that didn't 
matter. A twisted root was digging into her side — that, too, 
didn't matter. Nothing mattered. 
Why had no one told her she 
was an inferior being?. Somehow 
she had known; she had always 
known. But no one had ever 
±hown her before. 

She realized afterward why the 
man and the woman, who must 
have seen or guessed what had 
really happened, had spoken as 
they did. They had, or were going to have, children. They hated 
all androids. Androids were unnecessary, their enemies, and the 
enemies of their children. 

But at the time she merely 
waited helpless, 'incapable of 
thought. The man would come 
and beat her, Susan and Roger 
would turn her away, and she 



would never know happiness 
again. 

XIII 

"1%/ffY parents never knew about 
■L" that," said Alison. "I hid 
in the bushes until it was dark, 
and then went straight home. I 
climbed into my bedroom from 
the outhouse and pretended later I'd been there for hours." 

"Why didn't you tell anyone?" 
Roderick asked. 

Alison shrugged. "It was a 
small incident that concerned me 
alone. I knew, once I'd had time 
to think, that my adopted, parents would be upset and angry, 
but not at me. I thought ( I'd 
better keep it to myself. I wasn't 
hurt and none of it matters when 
you look back on it, does it?" 

"How about the man who was 
going to give you a good hiding?" 

"I never saw him again. It was 
two years later when I got my 
first punishment." 

"Just a minute," said Roderick. "You said that even then 
you knew you were an inferior 
being — you had always known, 
but this was the first time anyone showed you. How had you 
known? Who or what had told 
you? When? Where?" 

Alison tried. They could see 
her try. But she had to say: "I 
don't know." 

"All right," said Roderick, as 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



29 



if it weren't important. "What 
was this that happened two years 
later?" 

"Perhaps I am giving too much 
significance to these incidents," 
Alison remarked apologetically. 
"Certainly they happened. But 
when I say 'two years passed,' 
perhaps I'm not making it clear 
that in those two years hardly 
unj*thing happened, hardly anything was said or done, to remind 
me I was an android and not a 
human being. 

"When I was about sixteen or 
seventeen, I suddenly developed 
a talent for tennis. I had played 
since I was quite young, but just 
as front-rank players run in and 
out of form, I improved quite unexpectedly. I joined a new club. 
I was picked for an important 
match. I was in singles, mixed 
and women's doubles. I did well, 
but that's not the point. 

"After the match, my doubles 
partner told me I was wanted in 
the locker room. There was 
something strange about the way 
she told me, but I couldn't place 
it. I wondered if I'd broken some 
rule, failed to check with someone, played in the wrong match, 
or forgotten to bow three times 
to the east — you know what these 
clubs are like." 

"No, we don't," said Judge 
Collier. "We know nothing, remember? Tell us." 

Unexpectedly, he .got an ap


proving nod from the unpredictable Roderick. 

XIV 

A LI SON smiled uncertainly as 
she followed Veronica. She 
wasn't nervous or sensitive as a 
.rule; she seldom felt apprehension. She was curious, naturally, 
and even wilder possibilities suggested themselves. Had she been 
mistaken for someone else? Had 
someone stolen something and 
they thought she'd done it? Had 
someone inspected her racket and 
found it was an inch too wide? 

The whole team was waiting in 
the locker room. It looked serious, especially when she saw their 
expressions. It still didn't occur 
to her that the fact that she was 
an android could have anything 
to do with it. Only once in her 
life had there been any real indication^that in some way androids were inferior beings. 

But that was what it was. Bob 
Walton, the captain of the team, 
said gravely that their opponents, 
well beaten, had accused them of 
recruiting star androids to help 
them. 

Alison laughed. "That's a new 
one. I've heard some peculiar excuses. Made them myself, too — 
the light was bad, the umpire 
was crazy, I had a stone in my 
shoe, people were moving about, 
the net was too high. But never

'You fielded androids against us.' 
Androids are just ordinary people — good and bad tennis players. The open singles champion is 
an android, but the number one 
woman is human. You know that 
as well as I do. Might as well 
complain because you're beaten 
by tall people, or short people, 
or people with long arms." 

Everyone had relaxed. 

"Sorry, Alison," said Walton. 
"It's just that none of us knew 
you weren't an android." 

Alison frowned. "What's all 
this? I'm an android, sure. I 
didn't say so only because nobody asked me." 

"We took it for granted," said 
Walton stiffly, "that you would 
know ... as, of course, you did. 
There are no androids competing 
in the Athenian League. We try 
to keep one group, at least, 
clean." 

He looked at the other two men 
in the team and inclined his 
head. Without a word they left 
the room, all three of them. 

Alison, left with the other 
three girls, one of whom she had 
kept out of the team, looked exasperated. 

"This is nonsense," she said. 
"If you like to run an all-human 
league, that's all right as far as 
I'm concerned l but you should 
put up notices to avoid misunderstanding. I didn't know you 
were — " 



"Whether you knew or not is 
beside the point," said Veronica 
coldly — the same Veronica who 
had laughed and talked and won \ 
a match with Alison only a few 1 
minutes before. "We're going to ' 
make sure you never forget." 

THEY closed in on her. It was 
to be a fight, apparently. Alison didn't mind. She jabbed Veronica in the ribs and sent her 
gasping across the room. She expected them to tear her clothes, 
thinking it would be conventional 
in dealing with android girls. But 
it was quite different from the 
scene in the bushes. This was 
clean and sporting. The men had 
left, very properly, and instead of 
half a dozen youths with a knife 
against a terrified child, it was 
only three girls to one. 

Alison fought hard, but fair. 
She guessed that, if she didn't 
fight clean, it would be ammunition for the android-haters. To do 
them justice, the other girls were 
clean, too. They didn't mind 
hurting her, but they didn't go 
for her face, use their nails or 
yank her hair. 

Alison gave a good account of 
herself, but other things being 
equal, three will always overcome one. She was turned on her 
face on the floor. One of the girls 
sat on her legs and one on her 
shoulders while the third beat 
the seat of her shorts with a 



32 




 



i irmly swung racket. 

It was no joke. Alison wouldn't 
have made a sound if it had 
>ren far worse, but when they 
i ft her go, she was feeling sorry 
lor herself. They left her alone 
>i\ the room. 

She picked herself up and 
lusted herself off. The floor was 
lean and the mirror in one 
■ orner showed that she looked 
ill right. In fact, she looked coniderably better than the three 
r.irls who had beaten her. 

Still angry, she was able 
io grin philosophically at the 
thought that she could beat them 
all in a beauty contest and at 
tennis. She could tell herself, if 
she liked, that they were jealous 
of her. It was probably at least 
partly true. 

Her feelings were hurt, but 
there was no other damage. She 
could even see their point of 
view. 

XV 

"YV7HAT was their point of 
of view?" asked Roderick. 

"Well, they were human and 
they were snobs. They'd even 
have admitted they were snobs, 
if you put the question the right 
way. It was a private club — " 

"And it was quite reasonable," 
suggested Roderick softly, "that 
they should exclude androids, 
who are inferior beings." 



"No, not quite that," Alison 
protested, laughing. "I don't 
really believe . . ." 

She stopped. 

"Just sometimes?" Roderick 
persisted. "Or just one part of 
you, while the other knows quite 
well an android is as good as a 
human?" 

Alison shivered suddenly. "You 
know, I have a curious feeling, as 
if I were being trapped into 
something." 

"That's how people always 
feel," said Roderick, "just before they decide they needn't be 
terrified any more of spiders or 
whatever it was they feared." 

The court was very quiet. 
There was something about 
Roderick's professional competence and Alison's determination 
to cooperate that made any kind 
of interruption out of the question. 

"There's very little more I can 
say about this," said Alison. "I 
took a job, not because I had to, 
but because I wanted to. It was 
with an advertising agency. They 
knew I was an android. They 
paid jne exactly what they paid 
anyone else. When I did well, 
they gave me a raise. 

"But then I noticed something 
— I never got any credit for 
anything. When I had an idea, 
somehow it was always possible 
to give the credit to someone else. 
Soon there was a very curious 



MADE IN U.S.A. 



33 



situation. I held a very junior 
position, I had little or no standing, but I did responsible work 
and I was paid well for it. 

"I went to another agency and 
it was quite different. Again, they 
knew I was an android, but no 
one seemed remotely interested. 
When I did well, I was promoted. When I did badly on any 
job, my chief swore at me and 
called me a fool and an incompetent and an empty-headed 
glamor girl and a lot of things 
I'd rather not repeat here. 

"But it never seemed to occur 
to him to call me a dirty android. I don't think he was an 
android himself, either. 

"I joined a dramatic society, 
but again I chose the wrong club. 
They didn't mind at all that I 
was an android. They didn't keep 
me in small parts. But it was 
perfectly natural that the three 
human girls in the cast shouldn't 
want to use the same dressing 
room as another android girl in 
the show and I did. When we 
were at small places, she and I 
had to change in the wings. 

"There were scores of other little incidents of the same kind. 
They multiplied as I grew older 
— not because differentiation was 
getting worse, but because I was 
moving in -higher society. In 
places where it's held against you 
that you didn't go to Harvard or 
Yale, naturally it's a disadvan


tage if you're an android, besides. 

"Then a law was passed and ' 
it was no longer necessary to 
admit being an android. I don't 
know what the Athenian Tennis 
League did about that. I'd come | 
to Everton then and hardly any- J 
one knew I was an android. And 
the plain fact, despite everything 
I've said, is that hardly anyone , 
cared. There are so many an- I 
droids, so many humans. You ] 
may find yourself the only android in a group — or the only 
human. 

"Then I met Roderick." 

"There," said Roderick, "i 
think we can stop." He turned t 
the judge. "I'm withdrawing my 
suit, of course. I think I made 
that clear quite a while ago." 

He gave Alison his arm. "Come 
on, sweetheart, let's go." 

THE roar burst out again. It 
must have been both one of 
the noisiest and one of the quietest trials oh record. The judge, 
dignity forgotten, was standing 
up, hopping from one foot to 
the other in impatience and vexation. 

"You can't go like that!"* he 
shrieked. "We haven't finished 
. . . we don't know . . ." 

"I've gone as far as I can 
here," said Roderick. He hesitated as the roar grew. "All 
right," he went on, raising his 
voice. "But you don't explain 



34 




 



•' "plr to themselves. Any little 
ks that make them do funny 
Iiiiirs, or not do normal things, 
" get them gradually to exii to you, and to themselves." 
Me searched in his pockets and 
d out a key ring. "Go and 
•..hi in the car, honey," he said, 
• nd told Alison where it was. 
ilw went, dazed. 

"I'll have to keep the papers 
Horn her for a day or two," Rod■ rick went on, almost to himself. 

After that, it won't matter." He 
"nucd his attention to the court. 

All right, then, listen. If I'm 
i mht, I've found something that's 
i>rcn under everyone's nose for 
' wo hundred years and has never 
iwh seen before. I don't say I 
lound it in five minutes. I've 
Urrn working it out for the last 
twenty-four hours, with the help 
of quite a few records of android 
patients. 

"Will you listen?" he yelled as 
the excited chatter increased. "I 
don't want to tell you this. I 
want to go home with Alison. 
You've seen her. Wouldn't you 
want to?" 

The court gradually settled. 
"Let's consider human sterility 
for a moment," said Roderick. 
"As you might imagine, some of 
it's medical and some psychological. As a psychologist, I've cured 
people of so-called barrenness — 
nnd when I did, of course, it 
wasn't sterility at all, but a neu


rosis. These people didn't and 
don't have children because, owing to some unconscious conclusion they've reached, they don't 
want them, feel they shouldn't 
have them, or are certain they 
can't have them. 

"But that's only some. Others 
come to me and, in consultation 
with a specialist in that line, I 
find there's nothing psychological 
about it whatever. 

"I have an idea, now, that all 
androids are psychologically sterile. Sterility has eaten into the 
cycle of human reproduction but 
how should it touch the androids? 
If one android can reproduce, 
they all can. Unless they, like 
these humans I've cured, have 
reached unconscious conclusions 
to the effect that androids can't 
or shouldn't or mustn't have 
children. 

"And we know they nearly all 
have." 

TITS voice suddenly dropped, 
and when Roderick spoke 
quietly, he was emphasizing 
points and people listened. There 
was no murmuring now. 

"I think if you were to run a 
survey and find who now is continuing to deny — passionately, 
honestly, sincerely — that androids can reproduce, you'd find 
the most passionate, honest and 
sincere are androids. If you 
looked into the past, I think 



MADE IN U. S. A. 



35 



you'd find the same thing. 
Wasn't it significant that it had 
to be a human doctor who declared publicly that androids 
weren't sterile? 

"Into every android is built 
the psychological axiom that an 
android must be inferior to a 
human to survive. That's the answer. Androids don't come to me 
to be cured of this because they 
don't want to be cured of it. 
They know it's essential to them. 
With the more aware part of 
their brains, they may know exactly the opposite, but that 
doesn't count when it comes to 
things like this. 

"And long ago, without knowing it, androids picked on this. 
Androids could not be a menace 
if they couldn't reproduce. Androids would be duly inferior if 
they couldn't reproduce. Androids would be allowed to exist 
if they couldn't reproduce. Androids could compete with humans in other things if . they 
couldn't reproduce." 

He knew he was right as he 
looked around the court. For 
once, almost at a glance, it was 
possible to tell humans from androids. Half the people in court 
were interested, bored, amused, 
indifferent, thoughtful — the humans. The* other half were angry, frightened, ashamed, apathetic, resentful, wildly excited, 
or in tears . . . for Roderick was 



tearing at the very foundation 
of their world. 

"I have real hopes for Alison," 
he remarked mildly, "because • 
she brought in Dr. Smith. See 
what that means? Not one an 
droid in a thousand could have 
done it. She must love me a lot 
. . . but that's none of your 
business." 

He went the way Alison had 
gone. No one tried to stop him 
this time. At the door, he paused. 

"When the first acknowledged 
android children are born," he 
observed, "it'll mean that regardless of the trials or disasters 
mankind still has to face, the 
human race won't die out. Because ... I think we might all 
chew a little on this point . . . 
the children of androids can't be 
android, can they?" 

XVII 

RODERICK drove. Alison 
usually did when they were 
out in a car together, but there 
was an unspoken agreement that 
Roderick would have to take 
charge of almost everything for 
a while. 

"We both won," she said happily. "At least, we will have when 
little Roderick arrives." 

"Do you believe he will?" 
asked Roderick, in his professional, neutral tone. 

"Not quite. I wonder what you 



.36 




 



•xtid in the court. I suppose I'm 
not to try to find out?" 

"FincJ out if you like. But do 
it from yourself. From what's in 
vou. I'll help." 

"I think," Alison mused, "it 
must be something to do with 
I >r Smith." 

"Oh? Why?" 

"Because I had the most peculiar feeling when I remembered 
lirnring about him and the idea 
Hint androids could have children. Like when Hewitt had his 
Unife in my stomach, only as 
if . . ." 

She laughed nervously, unomfortably. "As if I were holding; it myself, and had to cut 
omething out, but couldn't do 
it without killing myself. Yet I 
had a sort of idea I could cut 
it out, if I tried hard enough and 
long enough, and not kill myself." 

Roderick turned the corner into their street. "This is a little 
unprofessional," he said, the exhilaration in his voice ill-concealed, "but I don't think it'll do 
any harm with you, Alison. 
There is going to be a little 
Roderick. I didn't decide it. You 



decided it. And it won't kill you. 
And — God, look at that!" 

Cameras clicked like grasshoppers as Roderick Liffcom carried 
his bride across the threshold. 
The photographers hadn't had to 
follow them, for they knew where 
the Liffcoms were going. Scores 
of plates were exposed. The Liffcoms were news. The name of 
Liffcom was known to almost 
everyone. 

Roderick was big and strong 
enough to treat his wife's 115 
pounds with contempt, but there 
was no contempt in the way he 
held her. He carried her as if she 
was made of crystal which the 
faintest jar would shatter. One 
could see at a glance that he 
could have carried any girl he 
liked over the threshold. 

Alison nestled in his arms like 
a kitten, eyes half-closed with 
rapture, arms about Roderick's 
neck. One could see at a glance 
she could have been carried over 
the threshold by any man she 
liked. 

As they went in, it was the 
beginning of a story. -But let's be 
different and call it the end.

seventh 

victim 



Illustrated by EMSH 



By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

The most dangerous game, said 
one writer, is Man. But there 
is another still more deadly! 




STANTON Frelaine sat at 
his desk, trying to look as 
busy as an executive should 
at nine-thirty in the morning. It 
was impossible. He couldn't concentrate on the advertisement he 



38 



had written the previous night, 
couldn't think about business. All 
he could do was wait until the 
mail came. 

He had been waiting for his 
notification for two weeks now. 
The government was behind 
schedule, as usual. 

The glass door of his office was 
marked Morger and Frelaine, 
Clothiers. It opened, and E. J. 
Morger walked in, limping slightly from his old gunshot wound. 
His shoulders were bent ; but at 
the age of seventy -three, he 
wasn't worrying too much about 
his posture. 

"Well, Stan?" Morger asked. 
"What about that ad?" 

Frelaine had joined Morger 
sixteen years ago, when he was 
twenty-seven. Together they had 
built Protec-Clothes into a million-dollar concern. 

"I suppose you can run it," 
Frelaine said, handing the slip of 
paper to Morger. If only the mail 
would come earlier, he thought. 

" 'Do you own a ProtecSuit?' " Morger read aloud, holding the paper close to his eyes. 
" 'The finest tailoring in the world 
has gone into Morger and Frelaine's Protec-Suit, to make it the 
leader in men's fashions.'" 

Morger cleared his throat and 
glanceH at Frelaine. He smiled 
and read on. 

" 'Protec-Suit is the safest as 
well as the smartest. Every Pro


tec-Suit comes with special builtin gun pocket, guaranteed not to 
bulge. No one will know you are 
carrying a gun — except you. The 
gun pocket is exceptionally easy 
to get at, permitting fast, unhindered draw. Choice of hip or 
breast pocket.' Very nice," Morger commented. 

Frelaine nodded morosely. 

" 'The Protec-Suit Special has 
the fling-out gun pocket, the 
greatest modern advance in personal protection. A touch of the 
concealed button throws the gun 
into your hand, cocked, safeties 
off. Why not drop into the Protec- Store nearest you? Why not 
be safe?' 

"That's fine," Morger said. 
"That's a very nice, dignified 
ad." He thought for a moment, 
fingering his white mustache. 
"Shouldn't you mention that 
Protec-Suits come in a variety of 
styles, single and double-breasted, one and two button rolls, deep 
and shallow flares?" 

"Right. I forgot." 

TT'RELAINE took back the 
sheet and jotted a note on the 
edge of it. Then he stood up, 
smoothing his jacket over his 
prominent stomach. Frelaine was 
forty-three, a little overweight, a 
little bald on top. He was an 
* amiable-looking man with cold 
eyes. 

"Relax," Morger said. "It'll 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



39 



come in today's mail." 

Frelaine forced himself to 
smile. He felt like pacing the 
floor, but instead sat on the edge 
of the desk. 

"You'd think it was my first 
kill," he said, with a deprecating 
smile. 

"I know how it is," Morger 
said. "Before I hung up my gun, 
I couldn't sleep for a month, waiting for a notification. I know." 

The two men waited. Just as 
the silence was becoming unbearable, the door opened. A clerk 
walked in and deposited the mail 
on Frelaine's desk. 

Frelaine swung around and 
gathered up the letters. He 
thumbed through them rapidly 
and found what he had been 
waiting for — the long white envelope from ECB, with the official government seal on it. 

"That's it!" Frelaine said, and 
broke into a grin. "That's the 
baby!" 

"Fine." Morger eyed the envelope with interest, but didn't 
ask Frelaine to open it. It would 
be a breach of etiquette, as well 
as a violation in the eyes of the 
law. No one was supposed to 
know a Victim's name except his 
Hunter. "Have a good hunt." 

"I expect to," Frelaine replied confidently- His desk was 
in order — had been for a week. 
He picked up his briefcase. 

"A good kill will do you a 



world of good," Morger said, putting his hand lightly on Frelaine's 
padded shoulder. "You've been 
keyed up." 

"I know." Frelaine grinned 
again and shook Morger's hand. 

"Wish I was a kid again," Morger said, glancing down at his 
crippled leg with wryly humorous 
eyes. "Makes me want to pick 
up a gun again." 

The old man had been quite a 
Hunter in his day. Ten successful 
hunts had qualified him for the 
exclusive Tens Club. And, of 
course, for each hunt Morger had 
had to act as Victim, so he had 
twenty kills to his credit. 

"I sure hope my Victim isn't 
anyone like you," Frelaine said, 
half in jest. 

"Don't worry about it. What 
number will this be?" 

"The seventh." 

"Lucky seven. Go to it," Morger said. "We'll get you into the 
Tens yet." 

Frelaine waved his hand and 
started out the door. 

"Just don't get careless," 
warned Morger. "All it takes is a 
single slip and I'll need a new 
partner. If you don't mind, I like 
the one I've got now." 

"I'll be careful," Frelaine 
promised. 

TNSTEAD of taking a bus, 
Frelaine walked to his apartment. He wanted time to cool 



40 




 



off. There was no sense in acting 
like a kid on his first kill. 

As he walked, Rrelaine kept his 
eyes strictly to the front. Staring 
at anyone was practically asking 
for a bullet, if the man happened 
to be serving as Victim. Some 
Victims shot if you just glanced 
at them. Nervous fellows. Frelaine prudently looked above the 
heads of the people he passed. 

Ahead of him was a huge billboard, offering J. F. O'Donovan's 
services to the public. 

"Victims!" the sign proclaimed 
in huge red letters. "Why take 
chances? Use an O'Donovan accredited Spotter. Let us locate 
your assigned killer. Pay after 
you get him!" 

The sign reminded Frelaine. 
He would call Morrow as soon as 
he reached his apartment. 

He crossed the street, quickening his stride. He could hardly 
wait to get home now, to open 
the envelope and discover who his 
victim was. Would he be clever 
or stupid? Rich, like Frelaine's 
fourth Victim, or poor, like the 
first and second? Would he have 
an organized Spotter service, or 
try to go it on his own? 

The excitement of the chase 
was wonderful, coursing through 
his veins, quickening his heartbeat. From a block or so away, 
he heard gunfire. Two quick 
shots, and then a final one. 

Somebody got his man, Fre


laine thought. Good for him. 

It was a superb feeling, he told 
himself. He was alive again. 

AT his one-room apartment, 
the first thing Frelaine did 
was call Ed Morrow, his spotter. 
The man worked as a garage attendant between calls. 
"Hello, Ed? Frelaine." 
"Oh, hi, Mr. Frelaine." He 
could see the man's thin, greasestained face, grinning fiat-lipped 
at the telephone. 

"I'm going out on one, Ed." 
"Good luck, Mr. Frelaine," Ed 
Morrow said. "I. suppose you'll 
want me to stand by?" 

"That's right. I don't expect to 
be gone more than a week or two. 
I'll probably get my notification 
of Victim Status within three 
months of the kill." 

"I'll be standing by. Good 
hunting, Mr. Frelaine." 

"Thanks. So long." He hung 
up. It was a wise safety measure 
to reserve a first-class spotter. 
After his kill, it would be Frelaine's turn as Victim. Then, 
once again, Ed Morrow would be 
his life insurance. 

And what a marvelous spotter 
Morrow was! Uneducated — stupid, really. But what an eye for 
people! Morrow was a natural. 
His pale eyes could tell an outof-towner at a glance. He was 
diabolically clever at rigging an 
ambush. An indispensable man. 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



41 



Frelaine took out the envelope, 
chuckling to himself, remembering some of the tricks Morrow 
had turned for the Hunters. Still 
smiling, he glanced at the data 
inside the envelope. 

Janet-Marie Patzig. . 

His Victim was a female! 

Frelaine stood up and paced 
for a few moments. Then he read 
the letter again. Janet-Marie Patzig. No mistake. A girl. Three 
photographs were enclosed, her 
address, and the usual descriptive 
data. 

Frelaine frowned. He had never 
killed a female. 

He hesitated for a moment, 
then picked up the telephone and 
dialed. 

"Emotional Catharsis Bureau, 
Information Section," a man's 
voice answered. ' 

"Say, look," Frelaine said. "I 
just got my notification and I 
pulled a girl. Is that in order?" 
He gave the clerk the girl's name. 

"It's all in order, sir," the 
clerk replied after a minute of 
checking micro-files. "The girl 
registered with the board under 
her own free will. The law says 
she has the same rights and privileges as a man." 

"Could you tell me how many 
kills she has?" 

"I'm sorry, sir. The only information you're allowed is the 
victim's legal status and the descriptive data you have received." 



"I see." Frelaine paused. 
"Could I draw another?" 

"You can refuse the hunt, of 
course. That is your legal right. 
But you will not be allowed another Victim until you have 
served. Do you wish to refuse?" 

"Oh, no," Frelaine said hastily. 
"I was just wondering. Thank 
you." 

TTE hung up and sat down in 
his largest armchair, loosening his belt. This required some 
thought. 

Damn women, he grumbled to 
himself, always trying to horn in 
on a man's game. Why can't they 
stay home? 

But they were free citizens, he 
reminded himself. Still, it just 
didn't .seem feminine. 

He knew that, historically 
speaking, the Emotional Catharsis Board had been established 
for men and men only. The board 
had been* formed at the end of 
the fourth world war — or sixth, 
as some historians counted it. 

At that time there had been a 
driving need for permanent, lasting peace. The reason was practical, as were the men who 
engineered it. 

Simply — annihilation was just 
around the corner. 

In the world wars, weapons 
increased in magnitude, efficiency 
and exterminating power. Soldiers became accustomed to 



42 




 



them, less and less reluctant to 
use them. 

But the saturation point had 
been reached. Another war would 
truly be the war to end all wars. 
There would be no one left to 
start another. 

So this peace had to last for 
all time, but the men who engineered it were practical. They 
recognized the tensions and dislocations still present, the cauldrons in which wars are brewed. 
They asked themselves why 
peace had never lasted in the 
past. 

"Because men like to fight," 
was their answer. 

"Oh, no!" screamed the idealists. 

But the jnen who engineered 
the peace were forced to postulate, regretfully, the presence of 
a need for violence in a large 
percentage of mankind. 

Men aren't angels. They, aren't 
fiends, either. They are just very 
human beings, with a high degree 
of combativeness. 

With the scientific knowledge 
and the power they had at that 
moment, the practical men could 
have gone a long way toward 
breeding this trait out of the race. 
Many thought this was the answer. 

The practical men didn't. They 
recognized the validity of competition, love of battle, strength in 
the face of overwhelming odds. 



These, they felt, were admirable 
traits for a race, and insurance 
toward its ' perpetuity. Without 
them, the race would be bound to 
retrogress. 

The tendency toward violence, 
they found, was inextricably 
linked with ingenuity, flexibility, 
drive. 

The problem, then: To arrange 
a peace that would last after they 
were gone. To stop the race from 
destroying itself, without removing the responsible traits. 

The way to do this, they decided, was to rechannel Man's 
violence. 

Provide him with an outlet, 
an expression. 

The first big step was the legalization of gladiatorial events, 
complete with blood and thunder. 
But more was needed. Sublimations worked only up to a point. 
Then people demanded the real 
thing. 

There is no substitute for murder. 

CJO murder was legalized, on a 
^strictly individual basis, and 
only for those who wanted it. 
The governments were directed 
to create Emotional Catharsis 
Boards. 

After a period of experimentation, uniform rules were adopted. 

Anyone who wanted to murder could sign up at the ECB. 
Giving certain data and assur


SEVENTH VICTIM 



43 



ances, he would be granted a 
Victim. 

Anyone who signed up to murder, under the government rules, 
had to take his turn a few months 
later as Victim — if he survived. 

That, in essence, was the setup. 
The individual could commit as 
many murders as he wanted. But 
between each, he had to be a Victim. If he successfully killed his 
Hunter, he could stop, or sign up 
for another murder. 

At the end of ten years, an 
estimated third of the world's 
civilized population had applied 
for at least one murder. The 
number slid to a fourth, and 
stayed there. 

Philosophers shook their heads, 
but the practical men were satisfied. War was where it belonged 
— in the hands of the individual. 

Of course, there were ramifications to the game, and elaborations. Once its existence had been 
accepted it became big business. 
There were services for Victim 
and Hunter alike. 

The Emotional Catharsis Board 
picked the Victims' names at random. A Hunter was allowed six 
months in which to make his kill. 
This had to be done by his own 
ingenuity, unaided. He was given 
the name of his Victim, address 
and description-, and allowed to 
use a standard caliber pistol. He 
could wear no armor of any sort. 

The Victim was notified a week 



before the Hunter. He was told 
only that he was a Victim. He 
did not know the name of his 
Hunter. He was allowed his 
choice of armor, however. He 
could hire spotters. A spotter 
couldn't kill; only Victim and 
Hunter could do that. But he 
could detect a stranger in town, 
or ferret out a nervous gunman. 

The Victim could arrange any 
kind of ambush in his power to 
kill the Hunter. 

There were stiff penalties for 
killing or wounding the wrong 
man, for no other murder was 
allowed. Grudge killings and 
gain killings were punishable by 
death. 

The beauty of the system was 
that the people who. wanted to 
kill could do so. Those who didn't 
— the bulk of the population — 
didn't have to. 

At least, there weren't any more 
big wars. Not even the imminence of one. 

Just hundreds of thousands of 
small ones. 

T^RELAINE didn't especially 
•■- like the idea of killing a woman-; but she had signed up. It 
wasn't his fault. And he wasn't 
going to lose out on his seventh 
hunt. 

He spent the rest of the morning memorizing the data on his 
Victim, then filed the letter. 

Janet Patzig lived in New 



44 




 



York. That was good. He enjoyed 
hunting in a big city, and he had 
nlways wanted to see New York. 
Her age wasn't given, but to 
judge from her photographs, she 
was in her early twenties. 

Frelaine phoned for jet reservations to New York, then took 
a shower. He dressed with care 
in a new Protec-Suit Special 
made for the occasion. From his 
collection he selected a gun, 
cleaned and oiled it, and fitted it 
into the fling-out pocket of the 
suit. Then he packed his suitcase. 

A pulse of excitement was 
pounding in his veins. Strange, 
he thought, how each killing was 
a new excitement. It was something you just didn't tire of, the 
way you did of French pastry or 
women or drinking or anything 
else. It was always new and different. 

Finally, he looked over his 
books to see which he would take. 

His library contained all the 
good books on the subject. He 
wouldn't need any of his Victim 
books, like L. Fred Tracy's Tactics for the Victim, with its insistence on a rigidly controlled 
environment, or Dr. Frisch's 
Don'r Think Like a Victim! 

He would be very interested in 
those in a few months, when he 
was a Victim again. Now he 
wanted hunting books. 

Tactics for Hunting Humans 

SEVENTH VICTIM 



was the standard and definitive 
work, but he had it almost memorized. Development of the Ambush was not adapted to his 
present needs. 

He chose Hunting in Cities, by 
Mitwell and Clark, Spotting the 
Spotter, by Algreen, and The 
Victim's Ingroup, by the same 
author. 

Everything was in order. He 
left a note for the milkman, 
locked his apartment and took a 
cab to the airport. 

TN New York, he checked into 
■* a hotel in the midtown area, 
not too far from his Victim's 
address. The clerks were smiling 
and attentive, which bothered 
Frelaine. He didn't like to be 
recognized so easily as an outof-town killer. 

The first thing he saw in his 
room was a pamphlet on his bedtable. How to Get the Most out 
of your Emotional Catharsis, it 
was called, with the compliments 
of the management. Frelaine 
smiled and thumbed through it. 

Since it was his first visit to 
New York, Frelaine spent the 
afternoon just walking the 
streets in his Victim's neighborhood. After that, he wandered 
through a few stores. 

Martinson and Black was a 
fascinating place. He went 
through their Hunter -Hunted 
room. There were lightweight 

45 



bulletproof vests for Victims, and 
Richard Arlington hats, with bulletproof crowns. 

On one side was a large display of a new .38 caliber sidearm. 

"Use the Malvern Strait-shot!" 
the ad proclaimed. "ECB-approved. Carries a load of twelve 
shots. Tested deviation less than 
.001 inch per 1000 feet. Don't 
miss your Victim! Don't risk 
your life without the best! Be 
safe with Malvern!" 

Frelaine smiled. The ad was 
good, and the small black weapon looked ultimately efficient. 
But he was satisfied with the one 
he had. 

There was a special sale on 
trick canes, with concealed fourshot magazine, promising safety 
and concealment. As a young 
man, Frelaine had gone in heavily 
for novelties. But now he knew 
that the old-fashioned ways were 
usually the best. 

Outside the store, four men 
from the Department of Sanitation were carting away a freshly 
killed corpse. Frelaine regretted 
missing the kill. 

He ate dinner in a good restaurant and went to bed early. 

Tomorrow he had a lot to do. 

The next day, with the face 
of his Victim before him, Frelaine walked through her neighborhood. He didn't look closely 
at anyone. Instead, he moved 



rapidly, as though he were really 
going somewhere, the way an old 
Hunter should walk. 

He passed several bars and 
dropped into one for a drink. 
Then he went on, down a side 
street off Lexington Avenue. 

There was a pleasant sidewalk 
cafe there. Frelaine walked past 
it. 

And there she was! He could 
never mistake the face. It was 
Janet Patzig, seated at a table, 
staring into a drink. She didn't 
look up as he passed. 

T^RELAINE walked to the end 
■■■ of the block. He turned the 
corner and stopped, hands trembling. 

Was the girl crazy, exposing 
herself in the open? Did she think 
she had a charmed life? 

He hailed a taxi and had the 
man drive around the block. 
Sure enough, she was just sitting 
there. Frelaine took a careful 
look. 

She seemed younger than her 
pictures, but he couldn't be sure. 
He would guess her to be not 
much over twenty. Her dark 
hair was parted in the middle 
and combed above her ears, giving her a nunlike appearance. 
Her expression, as far as Frelaine 
could tell, was one of resigned 
sadness. 

Wasn't she even going to make 
an attempt to defend herself? 



46 




 



Frelaine paid the driver and 
hurried to a drugstore. Finding 
a vacant telephone booth, he 
called ECB. 

"Are you sure that a Victim 
named Janet-Marie Patzig has 
been notified?" 

"Hold on, sir." Frelaine tapped 
on the door while the clerk looked 
up the information. "Yes, sir. We 
have her personal confirmation. 
Is there anything wrong, sir?" 

"No," Frelaine said. "Just 
wanted to check." 

After, all, it was no one's business if the girl didn't want to 
defend herself. 

He was still entitled to kill 
her. 

It was his turn. 

He postponed it for that day, 
however, and went to a movie. 
After dinner, he returned to his 
room and read the ECB pamphlet. Then he lay on his bed and 
glared at the ceiling. 

All he had to do was pump a 
bullet into her. Just ride by in a 
cab and kill her. 

She was being a very bad sport 
about it, he decided resentfully, 
and went to sleep. 

npHE next afternoon, Frelaine 
walked by the cafe again. The 
girl was back, sitting at the same 
table. Frelaine caught a cab. 

"Drive around the block very 
slowly 5 " he told the driver. 

"Sure," the driver said, grin


ning with sardonic wisdom. 

From the cab, Frelaine watched 
for spotters. As far as he could 
tell, the girl had none. Both her 
hands were in sight upon the 
table. 

An easy, stationary target. 

Frelaine touched the button of 
his double-breasted jacket. A fold 
flew open and the gun was in 
his hand. He broke it open and 
checked the cartridges, then 
closed it with a snap. 

"Slowly, now," he told the 
driver. 

The taxi crawled by the cafe. 
Frelaine took careful aim, centering the girl in his sights. His 
finger tightened, on the trigger. 

"Damn it!" he said. 

A waiter had passed by the 
girl. He didn't want to chance 
winging someone else. 

"Around the block again," he 
told the driver. 

The man gave him another 
grin and hunched down in his 
seat. Frelaine wondered if the 
driver would feel so happy if he v 
knew that Frelaine was gunning 
for a woman. 

This time there was no waiter 
around. The girl was lighting a 
cigarette, her mournful face intent on her lighter. Frelaine centered her in his sights, squarely 
above the eyes, and held h\s r 
breath. 

Then he shook his head and 
put the gun back in his pocket. 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



47 



The idiotic girl was robbing him 
of the full benefit of his catharsis. 

He paid the driver and started 
to walk. 

It's too easy, he told himself. 
He was used to a real chase. Most 
of the other six kills had been 
quite difficult. The Victims had 
tried every dodge. One had hired 
at least, a dozen spotters. But 
Frelaine had gotten to them all 
by altering his tactics to meet the 
situation. 

Once he had dressed as a milkman, another time as a bill collector. The sixth Victim he had 
had to chase through the Sierra 
Nevadas. The man had clipped 
him, too. But Frelaine had done 
better than that. 

How could he be proud of this 
one? What would the Tens Club 
say? 

That brought Frelaine up with 
a start. He wanted to get into the 
club. Even if he passed up this 
girl, he would have to defend 
himself against a Hunter. Surviving that, he would still be four 
hunts away from membership. Atthat rate, he might never get in. 

TTE began to pass the cafe 
again, then, on impulse, stopped abruptly. 

"Hello," he said. 
t Janet Patzig looked at him out 
of sad blue eyes, but said nothing. 

"Say, look," he said, sitting 



down. "If I'm being fresh, just 
tell me and I'll go. I'm an out-oftowner. Here on a convention. 
And I'd just like someone feminine to talk to. If you'd rather 
I didn't—" 

"I don't care," Janet Patzig 
said tonelessly. 

"A brandy," Frelaine told the 
waiter. Janet Patzig's glass was 
still half full. 

Frelaine looked at the girl and 
he could feel his heart throbbing 
against his ribs. This was more 
like it — having a drink with your 
Victim! 

"My name's Stanton Frelaine," he said, knowing it didn't 
matter. 

"Janet." 

"Janet what?" 

"Janet Patzig." 

"Nice to know you," Frelaine 
said, in a perfectly natural voice. 
"Are you doing anything tonight, 
Janet?" 

"I'm probably being killed tonight," she said quietly. 

Frelaine looked at her carefully. Did she realize who he was? 
For all he knew, she had a gun 
leveled at him under the table. 

He kept his hand close to the 
fling-out button. 

"Are you a Victim?" he asked. 

"You guessed it," she said sardonically. "If I were you, I'd stay 
out of the way. No sense getting 
hit by mistake." 

Frelaine couldn't understand

the girl's calm. Was she a suicide? Perhaps she just didn't 
care. Perhaps she wanted to die. 

"Haven't you got any spotters?" he asked, with the right 
expression of amazement. 

"No." She looked at him, full 
in the face, and Frelaine saw 
something he hadn't noticed before. 

She was very lovely. 

"I am a bad, bad girl," she 
said lightly. "I got the idea I'd 
like to commit a murder, so I 
signed for ECB. Then — I couldn't 
do it." 




RELAINE shook his head, 
sympathizing with her. 



"But I'm still in, of course. 
Even if I didn't shoot, I still have 
to be a Victim." 

"But why don't you hire some 
spotters?" he asked. 

"I couldn't kill anyone," she 
said. "I just couldn't. I don't even 
have a gun." 

"You've got a lot of courage," 
Frelaine said, "coming out in the 
open this way." Secretly, he was 
amazed at her stupidity. 

"What can I do?" she asked 
listlessly. "You can't hide from a 
Hunter. Not a real one. And I 
don't have enough money to 
make a real disappearance." 

"Since it's in your own defense, 
I should think — " Frelaine began, 
but she interrupted. 

"No. I've made up my mind 

SEVENTH VICTIM 



on that. This whole thing is 
wrong, the whole system. When 
I had my Victim in the sights — 
when I saw how easily I could — 
I could—" 

She pulled herself together 
quickly. 

"Oh, let's forget it," she said, 
and smiled. 

Frelaine found her smile dazzling. 

After that, they talked of other 
things. Frelaine told her of his 
business, and she told him about 
New York. She was twenty-two, 
an unsuccessful actress. 

They had supper together. 
When she accepted Frelaine's 
invitation to go to the Gladiatorials, he felt absurdly elated. 

He called a cab — he seemed to 
be spending his entire time in 
New York in cabs — and opened 
the door for her. She started in. 
Frelaine hesitated. He could have 
pumped a shot into her at that 
moment. It would have been very 
easy. 

But he held his hand. Just for 
the moment, he told himself. 

ITHHE Gladiatorials were about 
the same as those held anywhere else, except that the talent 
was a little better. There were the 
usual historical events, swordsmen and netmen, duels with saber 
and foil. 

Most of these, naturally, were 
fought to the death. 

49 



Then bull fighting, lion fighting and rhino fighting, followed 
by the more modern events. 
Fights from behind barricades 
with bow and arrow. Dueling on 
a high wire. 

The evening passed pleasantly. 

Frelaine escorted the girl home, 
the palms of his hands sticky with 
sweat. He had never found a woman he liked better. And yet she 
was his legitimate kill. 

He didn't know what he was 
going to do. 

She invited him in and they 
sat together on the couch. The 
girl lighted a cigarette for herself 
with a large lighter, then settled 
back. 

"Are you leaving soon?" she 
asked him. 

"I suppose so," Frelaine said. 
"The convention is only lasting 
another day." 

She was silent for a moment. 
"I'll be sorjjr to see you go. Send 
roses to my funeral." 

They were quiet for a while. 
Then Janet went to fix him a 
drink. Frelaine eyed her retreating back. Now was the time. He 
placed his hand near the button. 

But the moment had passed for 
him, irrevocably. He wasn't going to kill her. You don't kill the 
girl you love. 

The realization that he loved 
her was shocking. He'd come to 
kill, not to find a wife. 

She came back with the drink 



and sat down opposite him, staring at emptiness. 

"Janet," he said. "I love you." 

She sat, just looking at him. 
There were tears in her eyes. 

"You can't," she protested 
"I'm a Victim. I won't live long 
enough to — " 

"You won't be killed. I'm your 
Hunter." 

She stared at him a moment, 
then laughed uncertainly. 

"Are you going to kill me?" she 
asked. 

"Don't be ridiculous," he said. 
"I'm going to marry you." 

Suddenly she was in his arms. 

"Oh, Lord!" she gasped. "The 
waiting — I've been so frightened — " 

"It's all over," he told her. 
"Think what a story it'll make 
for our kids. How I came to murder you and left marrying you." 

She kissed him, then sat back 
and lighted another cigarette. 

"Let's start packing," Frelaine 
said. "I want — " 

"Wait," Janet interrupted. 
"You haven't asked if I love you." 

"What?" 

She was still smiling, and the 
cigarette lighter was pointed at 
him. In the bottom of it was a 
black hole. A hole just large 
enough for a .38 caliber bullet. 

"Don't kid arpund," he objected, getting to his feet. 

"I'm not being funny, darling," 
she said. 



50 




 



TN a fraction of a second, Frelaine had time to wonder how 
he could ever have thought she 
was not much over twenty. Looking at her now — really looking at 
her — he knew she couldn't be 
much less than thirty. Every 
minute of her strained, tense existence showed on her face. 

"I don't love you, Stanton," 
she said very softly, the cigarette 
lighter poised. 

Frelaine struggled for breath. 
One part of him was able to 
realize detachedly what a mar


velous actress she really was. She 
must have known all along. 

Frelaine pushed the button, 
and the gun was in his hand, 
cocked and ready. 

The blow that struck him in 
the chest knocked him over a 
coffee table. The gun fell out of 
his hand. Gasping, half -conscious, 
he watched her take careful aim 
for the coup de grace. 

"Now I can join the Tens," he 
heard her say elatedly as she 
squeezed the trigger.

FORECAST 

Leading next month's issue is an enchanting— literally enchanting— novella by James E. Gunn: WHEREVER YOU MAY BE. Since words like "enchanting" change meaning through misuse, let's keep in mind that it does not 
mean "darling" or "stunning" or any other Hollywoodism. The story is 
verbal, emotional and scientific witchery that will drag you into the action 
almost bodily . . wherever you may be! 

JUNKYARD by Clifford D. Simak sets you down on a fly-trap of a planet 
and challenges you to find your way off it again. Fuel isn't the problem, or 
wrecked equipment, or lack of complete and explicit directions. No, it's 
something else— junkyards just don't like to give up the things they accumulate. 

Both these stories are long and strong and loaded with adrenalin, so 
there may not be room for another novelet. On the other hand, there may. 
We'll see how the isue makes up and cram in, as usual, all the material it 
can hold. 

You can count on a full complement of short stories heavily armed with 
bright ideas, sharply drawn situations and ingenious solutions . . . plus our 
regular features (the editorial, for example, is guaranteed to produce both 
chuckles and snarls) . . . and, of course, Willy Ley's FOR YOUR INFORMATION, which continues the historically and scientifically important BIRTH 
OF THE SPACE STATION. 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



51 




THE BIRTH OF THE 
SPACE STATION 

MOST ideas which finally 
took the shape of an invention have a long and 
usually complicated history. Talk 
about the submarine and you 
can, without steaming, find dozens of examples of early thinking 
or dreaming about underwater 
travel. 

52 
 




t The amount of early material 
on flying is almost overwhelming. 

Even such a relatively simple 
machine as the typewriter can 
boast a lot of background — I remember the amazement with 
which I read a publication of the 
Society of German Engineers 
(VDI) some twenty years ago, 
for which a diligent researcher 
had collected dozens of centuryold typewriters. Not just reports, 
but pictures of them and even a 
number of originals. Moreover, 
he had covered only the Germanspeaking countries of Europe. 

Small wonder that nobody ever 
succeeded in writing a complete 
and reliable History of All Inventions, although there are at 
least a dozen books which bear 
some such title. 

However, there are exceptions. 
The "idea" of photography, prior 
to the first picture actually taken, 
seems to have been only a few 
years old. As for earlier prophecy, 
there is just one old French science fiction novel in which something resembling photography 
was forecast. 

Another exception is the X-ray. 
It did not have any earlier "history" at all. Dr. Konrad Rontgen 
discovered X-rays almost accidentally, immediately realized 
their" value for surgery— especially military and industrial surgery 
— and that was that. Later, some 



German doctor discovered an older book, dating back about a 
quarter-century prior to the actual discovery, in which the author writing under the heading of 
Medical Fairy Tales had said, 
"We'll make the patient as transparent as a jelly-fish," and this 
was duly noted as the only "prediction" of the X-ray. 

ri^HE concept of the space station is such an exception, too. 
While the idea of space travel has 
a two-thousand-year history, the 
idea of the space station has virtually none. It appeared for the 
first time in 1897 in Kurd Lasswitz' famous novel On Two Planets, and it was introduced as a 
technological concept in 1923 in 
Prof. Herman Oberth's first scientific work on space travel by 
means of liquid fuel rockets. 
There is nothing between these 
two dates which may be said to 
have contributed to the concept. 

True, old Herman Ganswindt 
told me that he had thought of 
space stations around 1880, when 
he toyed with the idea of reaction-propelled ships. Even if he 
remembered his youthful ideas 
correctly after so many years, he 
had not influenced anybody. At 
any event, he could not show me 
any documentation to prove he 
had mentioned the idea in public. 

Nor can I bring myself to consider a certain French science fic

53 



tion novel — now half a century 
old — as a contribution to tHfe idea, 
even though the theme consisted 
in putting something in an orbit 
around the Earth a few thousand 
miles away. 

This novel, Selena Cie, was 
based upon the notion that people could save money ordinarily 
spent for the illumination of cities 
and roads if only the Moon were 
not 240,000 miles away, but circled the Earth at an altitude of 
3000 or 4000 miles. (That it 
would spend a lot of time in the 
Earth's shadow when at such a 
short distance, which would eliminate it as a source of illumination, was nowhere mentioned.) 
The story relates that a mountain 
of pure iron is discovered in 
French Equatorial Africa which, 
wound with cables, makes an 
enormous and powerful magnet. 
Why this should pull the Moon 
closer is incomprehensible, but in 
the story it did. The outcome was 
less than satisfactory — the Moon 
wins and pulls the iron mountain 
clean out of the African soil. 

The concept of the space station thus originated in just two 
places: first in a novel and then 
in a scientific book. It has to be 
mentioned, however, that Kurd 
Lasswitz, the author of the novel, 
was a scientist himself, specifically an astronomer and professor 
of mathematics. The space station he thought up for his novel 



is so unique that it has never been 
imitated by any other writer, 
simply because it would have 
been such an obvious imitation. 

When Lasswitz wrote the book 
(during the years 1895-97), it was 
more or less generally accepted 
in astronomical circles that the 
planet Mars is inhabited by intelligent beings. Other theoretical 
reasoning had it that the planets 
were the older the farther they 
were from the Sun. Mars, as an 
older planet, had provided the 
proper conditions for the origin 
of life at an earlier date, so intelligent life had also appeared 
much earlier than here. Hence the 
intelligent Martians should be far 
ahead of us in every respect. 

T ASSWITZ drew from this the 
conclusion that, if space 
travel were possible at all, the 
Martians would come to us long 
before we could go to them. In 
order to explain the delay (for 
they might just as well have 
arrived during the reign of Nabopolassar of Babylon or of Augustus Caesar), Lasswitz made the 
problem of space travel appear 
much more difficult than it actually is. And he made the solution 
of the problem such that it could 
not be solved on Earth. 

On Mars, he postulated, there 
is a substance which happens to 
be transparent as glass, but which 
has the far more important prop


54 




 



rrty that it can also be made 
"transparent" to gravity. Lasswitz got around a few important 
theoretical difficulties by saying 
that the energy of gravity did not 
appear as gravity in treated material, but "in other forms of energy." 

He also was careful to point 
out that just as glass cannot be 
made completely transparent to 
light, this substance could not be 
made completely transparent to 
gravity, but only to a point where 
the still remaining weight did not' 
matter any more. And finally he 
made it clear that the substance 
retained its inertia. 

A takeoff from the planet, under these conditions, would then 
proceed as follows: 

The ship, spherical in shape for 
structural reasons, would be made 
virtually gravity-free. Instead of 
following its planet around the 
Sun, it would continue in a 
straight line, a tangent to the orbit. After waiting long enough, 
the planet would have receded 
far enough so that its gravitational field hardly influenced the 
ship, even if susceptibility to 
gravity were restored. But the 
Sun would then influence the ship 
and, by diligent and precalculated maneuvering in the gravitational fields, the ship could go 
from one planet to another, in a 
tedious and dangerous voyage. 
(You can see where H. G. Wells 



got his idea for cavorire for his 
story The First Men in the 
Moon.) But then reaction propulsion is added to the ships and 
the safety of trips and the duration are improved enormously. 

Still, a takeoff has to be made 
from the poles of the planet, 
where there is no rotation to interfere. It is still better not to 
take off from the surface at all, 
but from a space station. For 
Earth, this is an absolute necessity because the marvelous substance of the Martians happens 
to deteriorate in the presence of 
water vapor. 

Hence the Martians first equip 
their planet and then the Earth 
with two space stations each, 
placed vertically over the poles; 
in each case, one planet-radius 
from the surface. Travelers come 
from a polar installation on the 
ground to the space stations by 
way of a specialized conveyance 
built for just this purpose, and 
then transfer to the true spaceships. 

In appearance, the space stations resemble the planet Saturn 
sliced in half in the plane of its 
rings. There is a hemispherical 
main dome which has eight cutouts for the ships to berth in, 
with ring-shaped galleries around. 
The whole can be rotated around 
its vertical axis so that the station can be turned in such a manner that no part of its structure 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



will interfere with a departing or 
an incoming ship. 

Of course, nothing that is not 
made of this substance from Mars 
could be made to stay in place 
without moving over one of the 
poles. But aside from this, you 
might have noticed the first appearance of a number of very 
"modern" ideas; for example, the 
need for a specialized vehicle, capable of penetrating the atmosphere, for the trip from the 
ground to the station, while the 
spaceships proper never enter an 
atmosphere and are, in fact, incapable of doing it. 

TVTOW for the appearance of the 
" space station concept in science. As has been mentioned, the 
idea was introduced by Professor 
Hermann Oberth in 1923 in the 
first edition of his book Die Rakete zu den Planetenraumen ("A 
Rocket into Interplanetary 
Space"). Even there it cropped 
up very much as an afterthought, 
on pages 86-88, which are the last 
pages of the last chapter. 
In that last chapter, Prof. 
Oberth, after having investigated 
mathematically the characteristics of liquid fuel rockets and discussed possible design features, 
spoke about likely applications of 
large-size liquid, fuel rockets. He 
had only two in mind at the time, 
one a high altitude research rocket — virtually what we now actu


ally have with the rocket Aerobee 
— and one a man-carrying rocket 
ship for flights into space in the 
vicinity of Earth. Then he threw 
out a few estimates to indicate 
the general order of size which 
such rockets would have. 

He estimated, for example, that 
a rocket ship for flights up to 
about 1000 miles with a pilot only 
would have a takeoff weight of 
300 metric tons and that the 
rocket ship built for two men 
would need a takeoff weight of at 
least 400 metric tons. After that 
he started a new paragraph, writing (I am now translating from 
the original book) : 

"If we force such large -size 
rockets to circle the Earth, the 
rocket will behave like a small 
moon. Such rockets do not even 
have to be designed for landing. 
Contact between them and the 
Earth can be maintained by 
means of smaller rockets so that 
the large ones (let's call them 
observing stations) can be rebuilt 
in the orbit the better to suit 
their real purpose. If the continuing state of apparent weightlessness should have undesirable 
consequences, which, however, I 
doubt, one could connect two 
such rockets by wire ropes a few 
kilometers long and make them 
rotate around each other." 

Here you have the whole concept in a few sentences: The 
rocket which stays in space and 



56 




 



which is gradually changed 
ii round to such an extent that it 
cannot even land, anymore; the 
smaller transport rockets; the 
u lea of substituting centrifugal 
acceleration for gravity, if needed. 
| Then he went on to outline a few 
possible uses: 

"With their powerful instruments, they would be able to see 
line detail on Earth and could 
communicate by means of mirrors reflecting sunlight. [Remember that this was written about 
1921, when radio was very much 
in its infancy. — W.L. ] This might 
be useful for communication with 
places on the ground which have 
no cable connections and which 
cannot be reached by electric 
waves. Since, they, provided the 
sky is clear, could see a candle 
at night and the reflection from 
a hand mirror by day, provided 
only that they know where and 
when to look, they could maintain communications between expeditions and their homeland, 
colonies and their motherland, 
ships at sea, etc. . . . 

"The strategic value is obvious 
especially in the case of war in 
areas of low population density; 
they might either belong to one 
of the two countries at war or 
sell their services at high rates 
to one of the combatants . . . The 
station [at this point the term 
"station" is used for the first 
time] would notice every iceberg 



and warn ships . . . the catastrophe of the Titanic in 1912 
would have been avoided by such 
means." 

A ND then Oberth added another completely new idea which 
had not been voiced before anywhere. 

"All this," he wrote, "amounts 
to. practical advantages. But an 
even greater advantage could be 
gained in the following manner: 
one could spread a large circular 
wire net simply by rotating it 
around its center. Small plane 
metal mirrors could be fitted into 
the spaces between the wires and 
their position relative to the wire 
net could be controlled electrically from the station. The mirror 
as a whole should rotate around 
the Earth in a plane which forms 
a right angle with the plane of 
the Earth's orbit. The wire net 
would be inclined to the direction 
of the Sun's rays by 45°. By 
proper adjustment of the positions of the single facets, one 
could" either concentrate the reflected sunlight on specific points 
of the ground or could diffuse 
it over large areas, or, if not needed, make the whole beam miss 
the Earth. 

If, for example, the mirror is 
1000 kilometers (600 miles) distant, the image of the Sun from 
each facet would have a diameter 
of 10 kilometers; if they are made 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



, 57 



to coincide, the energy would be 
concentrated in an area of 78 
square kilometers. Since the mirror can have any size desired, it 
could have colossal effects. It 
would be possible, for example, 
to keep the shipping lane to Spitsbergen and the North Siberian 
ports ice-free by such concentrated sunlight. 

If the diameter of the mirror 
is 100 kilometers, it could make 
large areas in the North habitable by means of diffused sunlight. 
In the middle latitudes, it could 
prevent sudden drops in temperature in Spring and Fall and save 
the fruit and vegetable crops of 
whole countries. It is especially 
important that the mirror is not 
stationary over any one point of 
Earth and is therefore capable 
of rendering all these services . . ." 

After a discussion .of the most 
suitable material for the mirror 
(Oberth believed sodium metal 
would be best), and the estimated 
costs (far too low), he continued: 

"The observing station could 
also be a refueling station. If the 
hydrogen and oxygen [the fuels 
Oberth had in mind] are shielded 
against solar radiation, they'll 
keep for any length of time in the 
solid state. A rocket which is 
refueled at the station is no longer 
hampered by a,ir resistance and 
not much by the Earth's gravitation . . . Furthermore, it no 
longer needs a high velocity of 



its own. In the first place, the 
potential of the Earth is lower 
at the distance of the station. In 
the second place, the rocket only 
needs to make up the difference 
between the required final velocity and the velocity of the station 
which is, in round figures, six 
kilometers per second. 

If we now connect a large 
sphere of sodium metal which 
was assembled and filled with 
fuel in the station's orbit with a 
small solidly constructed rocket 
which pushes the "fuel sphere" 
ahead and draws its fuel from 
the sphere, we get a highly efficient apparatus which should be 
capable of flying to other 
planets." 

Oberth's first book stopped at 
that point. 

Then the concept of the station 
in space was adopted by" others 
who added their own ideas. How 
the evolution of the space station 
"progressed will be discussed here 
next month.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

/ know of binaries and I know 
that there are triple systems of 
stars, two stars moving around 
each other and one of them a 
binary itself. Are there systems 
of more stars than three and, if 
so, are they stable?

{city missing') 
If you had mentioned your 
city, you would have had your 
answer weeks ago. The answer 
is yes. 

One of the. examples which 
are easily found in the sky is 
the star Zeta JJrsae Majoris, the 
middle star in the "handle" of 
the Big Dipper. It is, as you can 
easily see, a naked-eye binary. 
The Arabic name of the brighter star is Mixar and that of the 
faint companion is Alkor; the 
latter word is said to mean "little rider". It was Sir William 
ilerschel who found that the 
larger of this pair was a binary, 
the two components of which 
are now known to swing around 
one another with a period of 
1.83 years. Later it was found 
that the fainter star is a binary 
too, with a period of only four 
dayg. And the smaller binary 
moves around the common center of gravity with the bigger 
one in sixty years. 

The most amazing collection 
of multiples of binaries can be 
found in the constellation which 
the ancients called Gemini, the 
Twins, because of the two 
bright stars Castor and Pollux. 
Both are not merely binaries 
but multiple systems. Seen with 
the naked eye, Castor looks like 
a single bright star but even a 
comparatively small telescope 



shows that it is a binary, the 
two components about 80 times 
farther away from each other 
than the earth is from the sun. 
Then it turned out that each one 
of these two white stars is a 
binary itself and a faint reddish star, not far away, was 
found to be a binary, too. So 
Castor consists of two white 
twins, with periods of three and 
nine days, respectively. The 
two pairs swing around their 
common center of gravity in 
340 years. The faint red star, 
is, as mentioned, a twin too, 
with a period of about 19 hours. 
And the red twins move slowly 
around the system of the two 
bright twins. They haven't been 
under observation long enough 
to establish their period but it 
must be many thousands of 
years. — As to your second question: to the best of our knowledge these systems are stable. 

/ recently read in a local paper 
that a German clergyman had 
found a city in the sea off the 
German coast. He is said to have 
expressed his belief that he has 
found Plato's Atlantis. Do you 
have any opinion about this? 

{Name withheld) 
Lansing, Minn. 

I haven't read this report 
even though I receive several 
German scientific periodicals. 
But I am quite certain that the

sunken city which the German 
clergyman found is not Plato's 
Atlantis — a remark which may 
have heen added by the newspaperman who wrote the story. 
The mention of Atlantis, no 
matter who made it, is probably just a hangover from those 
days when every sunken city, 
or suspicion of a sunken city, 
was linked with the Platonic dialogues. It can be considered 
pretty well established by now 
that the "model" for Plato's Atlantis was the city of Tartessos, 
the Biblical Tarshish, in western Spain; the same city which 
served as the model for Homer's Scheria in the Odyssey. 

On the other hand I feel reasonably sure that the German 
clergyman found something. 
Along the northern coast of 
Germany there are a number 
of remains of what looks like 
old roads which seem to lead 
straight into the sea. And there 
are also quite a number of local legends of remains of old 
cities and towns at the bottom 
of the sea, but generally close 
enough to present day land so 
that the land is still clearly in 
sight from the alleged locations 
of the old cities. The legends 
have a tendency to exaggerate, 
but most of them seem to be 
founded on some fact. Often 
these former cities — or better, 
townships — are generally re
60 



ferred to as "vinetas," which is 
supposed to be the name of the 
most famous of them. 

Detail is awfully hard to ascertain. It seems that about a 
thousand years ago a number 
of old townships were abandoned because they had been 
established too close to the 
shore line. It is even possible 
that the sea level rose somewhat as a late result of the melting of Ice Age glaciers. At any 
event the finding of a sunken 
settlement off the German coast 
is not at all unlikely. 

I may add a few words about 
the "city" of Vineta, the supposed name of which is sometimes used as a generic name. 
.The former existence of that 
city is historically well-established; it existed during the 
tenth and eleventh centuries 
and had been built by a Slavonic people, the Venden or 
Wenden. But the original name 
of the"*city was Jumne, the version Vineta originated by way 
of Latinization on the part of 
later chroniclers. They first 
transliterated JUMNE as IVMNETA which soon came to be 
written VIMNETA and finally 
VINETA. Although nobody 
doubted its former existence, 
and historians were agreed that 
the sea finally conquered merely an abandoned city destroyed 
by war, there was no agree

ment about where it originally 
Htood. It was known that lie inhabitants could reach it from 
the hinterland by travelling 
downstream on the Oder River, 
hut that still left a comparatively large area where it could 
have been. Only a quarter century ago did historians succeed 
in finding a place which was in 
full agreement with all the 
sources. It happened to he quite

// there is a layer of hydrogen 
in the upper atmosphere, is there 
not danger that one day a rocket 
will be fired high enough to enter 
and explode this hydrogen layer? 

Raymond Wilkes 

Box 114 

Greenfield, Missouri 
The answer to that one is 
"no" and this answer can be 
backed up with a number of 
good reasons. In the first place 
the idea that there is a layer of 
pure hydrogen in the upper atmosphere (proposed originally 
by Svante Arrhenius) has been 
dropped. In the second place 
even if there were such a layer 
it would be enormously attenuated and should properly be 
called "a vacuum with occasional hydrogen atoms in it." 
But even if there were a layer 
of pure hydrogen (which there 



isn't) and even if it had a density comparable to that at sea 
level (which is impossible) it 
would still not be ignited by a 
rocket's exhaust blast. Igniting 
hydrogen means to start combustion which requires oxygen. 
Without oxygen the hydrogen 
could not explode and in a pure 
hydrogen layer there would, of 
course, be no oxygen. Finally, 
if there were such a layer and 
if enough oxygen were present 
too, the whole would have been 
ignited by meteorites millions 
of years ago. 

When the distance from one 
planet to another is mentioned, 
do they measure from the center 
of one to center of the other or 
do they start measuring from the 
edge? 

Loren Shaw

Portland 66, Oregon 
All astronomical distances 
are center-to-center distances, 
not surface-to-surface distances. 
This is a fundamental rule but 
most of the time it would not 
matter much if surface-to-surface distance were used by 
somebody by mistake. In the 
case of Earth and Moon, the 
difference between center-tocenter distance and surface-tosurface distance is just about 
5000 miles. But the center-tocenter distance varies itself, 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



61 



from a minimum of 221,460 
miles to a maximum of 252,700 miles. In the case of Mars 
and Earth the difference becomes negligible, the difference 
between surface-to-surface and 
center-to-center distances is on 
the order of 6000 miles while 
the closest possible distance is 
35 million miles. 

How does the H-bomb work? 

Frank Goodwyn, Jr. 
9709 Lorain Avenue 
Silver Spring, Md. 
This question is a somewhat 
large order, — not even counting 
the fact that the classifications which are probably stamped on each and every document 
pertaining to the H-bomb are 
terrifying themselves. But since 
this question will probably 
come in from numerous readers I'll try to answer it to the 
best of my ability. Let's begin with the "old fashioned" 
A-bomb. This is a "fission 
bomb," which means that the 
atoms of uranium-235 or of 
plutonium break apart, into 
two pieces of about equal mass, 
releasing energy in the process. 
The H-bomb is known to be a 
"fusion bomb" in which hydrogen atoms are fused together 
into heavier atoms, presumably 
helium, a process which also 
releases energy. This fusion of 
hydrogen atoms is the process 



which keeps the sun and most 
of the other stars visible in the 
sky going. In our sun the process takes place in six successive 
stages which fuse four hydrogen atoms into one helium 
atom ; a carbon atom is involved 
in this process which has been 
" called the Solar Phoenix Reaction because that hydrogen 
atom which initiates the first 
step re-appears unchanged at 
the end of the sixth step so that 
it can start all over again. 

The fusion process in the 
H-bomb is in all probability 
quite different from the Solar 
Phoenix Reaction. But it has 
to be mentioned first that there 
are three kinds of hydrogen 
atoms, of three different 
weights and the rarer the heavier they are. The first is ordinary hydrogen, the second, of 
double the weight, is "heavy hydrogen" or Deuterium. The 
third, of thrice the weight of 
ordinary hydrogen is called Tritium. Ordinarily two "deuterons" would not fuse into one 
helium atom and no "triton" 
would consider fusing with a 
"proton," the nucleus of the 
ordinary hydrogen atom. The 
nuclei, having like electric 
charges, would repel one another if they came too close. 
Only if they move very fast can 
the energy of movement overcome the repulsion. It is easy 



62 




 



lo make small material particles 
move fast, all one has to do is 
to apply heat and thermal motion will he the result. All this 
is not precisely new knowledge, 
the main difficulty was to find 
a sufficiently intensive heat 
source so that the thermal motion would he violent enough to 
do what it was supposed to do. 
But the heat required was such 
that even an electric arc was icy 
cold by comparison. Not even 
the surface of our sun is hot 
enough for this purpose, one 
had to go into stellar interiors 
to find places with the requisite 
number of degrees of temperature. Until the A-bomb came 
along. The A-bomb does produce enough heat, even if only 
for a fraction of a second. It is 
for this reason that it has been 



said that the A-bomb is the 
"fuze" or "starter" for the 
H-bomb. The hydrogen in the 
H-bomb is probably not ordinary hydrogen; it would be asking too much to expect four 
atoms to have a head-on collision at precisely the right instant. But one can expect two 
deuterons to collide, or a triton 
to collide with a proton. Presumably, then, the hydrogen 
part of the H-bomb is a mixture of all three isotopes of hydrogen. Obviously there must 
be an optimum mixture. Obviously this optimum mixture is 
Top-Top Secret, for good and 
sufficient reasons. 

AH this, of course, is valid 
only with the proviso that the 
H-bomb is actually based on the 
reasoning given. 



WHAT'S YOUR PROBLEM? 

Science has become so complex and confusing, even to scientists, that 
there must be some question you'd like Willy Ley to explain clearly, authoritatively and in everyday English. 

As you can see for yourself, he's an expert on clarification. 

It should also be apparent that he is not a scientific snob— FOR YOUR 
INFORMATION is run for the benefit of laymen, not scientists — so there's no 
reason to be ashamed to ask any question in his field. 

All we request is that you hold your questions down to one or two at 
a time (you can always send in more, later) and type or print legibly. Please 
add your name and address— we'll withhold them if you want us to— because 
there isn't room to answer all queries in the magazine and every one of the 
others is answered by mail. 

Now . . . what was it you wanted to know?

Put six small drunken ants in 
a twenty-gallon oil drum and 
heave it into space somewhere 
between Earth and Mars — 

I SCRUBBED the tape and 
started over again. The 
space concept wasn't to 
scale, anyway. Six bacteria in a 
seed-spore might be nearer the 
mark. I had to convey space, 



time and place in a fashion that 
the lay public could grasp when 
and if we boomeranged home. 

It was difficult — impossible, 
perhaps — and not made easier by 
the noise. M'Bassi had improvised a bongo drum from an 
upturned wastebasket and Brocuzynski was trying to scramble 
onto the desk to do a step-dance. 

Yet I didn't wish to seek si

lence in my cabin. The ship was 
too vast, the company too small. 
Being alone made you feel that 
the alien dark might creep in behind you, reach out with tentacular ringers — 

I wanted to join Lao in his 
old game of "show-fingers-guesssum-guess-wrong-drink another" 
which can be conveyed in precisely two Chinese characters and

is perhaps the most ancient of all 
drinking games. 

But I stayed at the transcriber 
trying to think back, getting 
memories lined up to explain just 
why, in this instant of mankind's 
greatest adventure, it was necessary for these pioneers to be as 
soaked i«i alcohol as a sextet of 
brandied peaches. 

Necessary? Of course. Sam 
had given the instructions and 
impressioning long ago — 

That phrase seeped up from 
my subconscious. It seemed to 
mean something, but when I tried 
to pin it down for analysis, its 
sense-structure disappeared like 
a pellet of frozen C0 2 in a hot 
hand. It left me with a feeling of 
estrangement from the others, the 
seventh ant in the oil drum — the 
odd ant out. 

That's how I'd felt earlier when 
these six had been at each others' 
throats instead of around each 
others' necks. 

Six babies. Six damned, squalling selfish babies. Six bouncing, 
babbling, but far from bonny 
babies. 

Five months ago, on Mars, they 
had been responsible, well-integrated men, the pick of the nations, esteemed beyond the 
borders of their own countries. 

The trouble started a "month" 
after the Boomerang's strange 



drive Jiad reduced a whole hemisphere of that dead planet to 
glassy aridity and flicked us out 
of the Solar System. 

TT'IRST blowup came between 
-■- Aventos and Brodcuzynski. 
Chessmen were scattered over the 
messroom floor. When I told 
them to quit behaving like kids, 
Aventos turned his sneer on me. 

"Listen to All-Nations Boy! 
Get back to your diary, sonny. 
Sold it in advance, haven't you? 
The only one who's making 
money out of this crazy trip. 
That is, if we ever do return." 

I went back to my desk. I 
tried never to argue, only to 
pacify. It became increasingly 
difficult to sting any of them into 
the realization that they were 
mature men of science, not fretful schoolkids on a too-long picnic jaunt. 

We couldn't stay alone in our 
cabins and we couldn't stay together in the messroom. That's 
what it came to. 

And we couldn't wander alone 
in the empty, echoing gangways 
and corridors of the mile-long 
ship. That was the quickest way 
to go psychptic. 

Borg sparked the next eruption. The mystery outside had 
touched some vein of poetry in 
his Scandinavian soul. He stood 
by the vision screen one "day" 
and started quoting aloud. Very 



66 




 



loud — clear and ringing. 

It may have been his own 
stuff or a translation of one of 
the Sagas: 

"The sea-devils thunder and mock 
our ears 

With cries of women and blinded 
children; 

But we must keep our eyes on the 
prow 

Where stands Erik the Hairless One 
Defying the sea-mountains. 
Our lips are sealed with ice — " 

Braithewaite let out a howl 
like a factory hooter: "Shut up 
you damned Dane! I'm trying 
to read!" 

"Then go to your cabin. You 
don't appreciate good poetry, 
you clod of a Yorkshireman." 

I managed to grab Braithewaite before he made a suicidal 
rush at the Borg, who was big 
and strong enough to club him to 
death with a single fist. 

M'Bassi managed to keep out 
of quarrels, but his genial face 
turned to immobile ebony and 
reduced his normally fluent conversation to the grunted basics 
of his original tongue. And disdain and cold withdrawal crept 
into the eyes of Lao T'Sun. 

Me? All-Nations Boy, they 
called me, in good-humor at first, 
then mockingly and with raw resentment. They were all degreed 
men. I was a mere publicist, appointed official chronicler by fortuitous virtue of thoroughly 



mixed racial descent, abrogation 
of all nationality allegiances and 
world-citizen status. 

When instability affected these 
most stable of men, I became 
unofficial arbiter. Not a leader. 
There could be no leaders on this 
trip. 

THE ship was semi-automatic, 
crewless, photonically set to 
snap into normal space within 
planetary observation distance of 
a sun, and then return. 

A captain, despite all possible 
screening, might be partisan. He 
might attempt to land if a suitable planet were seen and claim it 
— and the Boomerang — for his 
own nation, with accidents arranged for those of the crew who 
protested. 

So there was no crew. 
The Boomerang couldn't have 
been built by any single nation. 
It taxed the resources of the entire Earth. And the federal Earth 
government had made sure it 
would return as a federal ship — 
if it returned. 

The luminous dust that now 
ringed the Earth to mark the 
orbit of the vanished Moon was 
a reminder that no single nation 
could ever again be allowed to 
make an extraterrestrial conquest. 

Federal government, imposed 
and maintained by mutual fear 
of a war that might reduce Earth 
itself to the same dust, hadn't

diminished nationalistic rivalries 
in all spheres. Healthy economic 
and cultural competition remained, but under extremely 
tight control. 

Now, if never before, I could 
see why. We're still children. 
Proof enough of that in the 
squabbles after the Boomerang 
had been built, when the "proportional representation" howl 
went up. It was howled down, and 
the decision was made that basic 
racial groupings and not states 
should be represented, on a geopolitical basis. 

Yet these six under the strain 
of flight had become a microcosm 
, of the still-divided world. 

But they were powerless to do 
more than quarrel. We were still 
under the aegis of the government which set and sealed us 
aboard this fabulous craft to go, 
observe, return and report. Our 
destiny was still in the hands of 
men back in the Solar System, 
as surely as though those hands 
were propelling us. 

Perhaps it was that knowledge 
of complete helplessness that was 
partly responsible for the psychological crackup. These men 
were theoreticians. None could 
assume control of the vessel. Only 
two — Aventos and Lao — had a 
full mathematical grasp of the 
space -strain theory on which the 
propulsion unit was based. But 
neither would know what to do 



with a spanner if you put one in 
theii hands. 

Except crack each other over 
the head with it. 

That's what nearly happened. 
Middle-aged men might taunt, 
decry, jibe, revert to childishness 
in these circumstances, but I figured their whole conditioning 
would prevent actual personal 
violence. 

Then I had to hold Braithewaite back. And not long after 
that episode, Lao T'Sung, oldest 
and wisest among us, staggered 
against my desk and slumped 
near my feet. 

Brodcuzynski looked at his 
grazed knuckles. "I must be insane," he muttered. He seemed 
even more shocked than Lao, who 
sat up and rubbed a bruised chin. 

For a moment, I thought the 
cosmologist would burst into 
tears of remorse. Instead, he 
helped the sixty-year-old mathematician to his feet. 

"T'Sung, I could cut off my 
fist," he said awkwardly. "Something snapped in my head. How 
can I apologize — " "* 

Lao T'Sung took both hands 
of the man who'd just struck him 
and said: "I'm more surprised 
than hurt. Better to forgive yourself, Brod, than need my forgiveness." 

And Brodcuzynski snatched his 
wrists away and shouted: "For 
God's sake, " don't be magnani

mous! Let me be sorry my own 
way!" 

1GOT up from my desk. "It 
was a lousy trick, Brod." 
"Don't I know it? Here, take 
a smack." He jutted out his unshaven chin. "Go on, take a poke 
at me. But don't preach!" 

Lao made graceful, deprecatory motions with his slender yellowy hands. 

"Lao, you've said I had wisdom 
beyond my years. Isn't it time we 
applied everybody's wisdom to 
the present problem?" 

Lao looked at me. "I refer that 
to the man who's just demonstrated that problem. What's 
your opinion, Brod?" 

Brodcuzynski worriedly passed 
the buck to M'Bassi. "You're the 
psychologist. Why did I knock 
Lao down? What's got into us?" 

M'Bassi was determinedly engaging himself with a stereostrip 
projection of the World Games. 
He lifted his eyebrows. 
"You heard," I said. 
"Just ignoring what I can't 
control." He unrolled his lanky 
black length from a sit-easy. He 
was wearing only a pair of linen 
shorts. "I could happily knock 
all your silly heads together — 
knowing that my own head needs 
an equally powerful jolt. My 
neural paths are cross^circuiting 
into a neurosis cycle. We're affected by something beyond our 



immediate understanding. Something beyond human experience. 
Out there." 

He nodded toward the dull jet 
of the vision screen. It was lifeless except for the blue -white 
patch of the Galaxy we were both 
leaving and approaching — and 
existing in. 

"Within our own solar system, 
our minds are safe. The distances : 
and speeds involved in transit 
are directly comprehensible. But 
our present velocity and mode of 
propulsion are beyond either direct or intuitive conception. * 

"In effect, we're in an alien 
universe. But our minds, trained \^ 
to perceive and correlate, are instinctively trying to grasp the 
unknowable. That way, conflict 
is sown in the unconscious." 

"But men have made such 
journeys in the imagination," Lao 
protested, "and the imagination 
is a function of the higher centers. Our friend Statlen — " he 
waved at me — "has a drawerful 
of photostats of ancient magazines in which the concept of 
interstellar travel is taken for 
granted." 

M'Bassi tried to smile. 

Once, Sam had a similar 
strained smile on his face, before 
he gave me the impressioning. 
The whole project was h'gliegn — 
fun, playing with kids — but I 
must forget that and behave like 



UNIVERSITY 



69 



a child . . . Who was Sam? A 
fleeting mental picture, halfdream — 

"Imagination," M'Bassi said, 
"can withdraw from the extrapolation of its own functioning. But 
our minds are experiencing the 
unknowable. We can't withdraw. 
Our destiny isn't in our own 
hands. And there lies another 
conflict. Part of our minds is back 
home, grasping the familiar referents. . The other part is here." 

M'Bassi was sitting on the 
ledge in front of the vision screen. 
Brodcuzynski sat up there beside 
him, blocking the incredible 
scene. 

"The end result?" Brod asked. 

"Increasing xenophobia," M'Bassi said. "The unconscious is 
fighting to retain its integrity 
against the impossible demands 
of the higher centers." He took a 
cigarette from the pocket of his 
shorts. "Neurosis begins. Finally, 
unless the conflict is sublimated 
or resolved — " 

He held up the cigarette, tensed 
his fingers. We watched the flimsy 
thing intently. It broke under the 
strain. He tossed the halves to the 
messroom floor. 

T AO, after the silence, asked: 
"Why isn't Statlen affected 
to the same extent as the rest of 

us?" 

"Young, resilient mind. And 



with all respect to our youthful 
friend, it's because his brain isn't 
highly trained in scientific method. The more you know, the more 
you know you don't know." 

I said: "Thanks. Are you suggesting they should have sent a 
bunch of morons? Anyway, how 
about Borg? He may act a little 
crazy, but he hasn't shown any 
homicidal tendencies. Let him 
alone and he'll spout poetry all 
day quite happily." 

"It's hard to believe you're all 
such innocents or so unobservant." M'Bassi grinned fleetingly. 
"Have you smelled Borg's 
breath? He carries it well, but 
he's been drunk for days. He's 
stultified his higher centers with 
alcohol." 

Borg Was gently snoring in a 
chair. 

"Why hasn't he mentioned it, 
shared it around?" 

M'Bassi shrugged. "We've 
hardly been on companionable 
terms lately. He may be ashamed 
of his secret tippling. And he may 
not have much of a hoard." 

"Would it work?" 

"Eventually it would have the 
same depressant effect as a barbiturate." 

Aventos said: "I disagree. Depends on the individual." 

"Wake Borg," I said. "I'd 
rather ride with a bunch of 
drunks than a homicidal gang of 
schizophrenics."

GALAXY SCIENCE -FICTION 



Lao was startled. "My dear 
Statlen, have some respect for 
your elders. Do you propose to 
feed us alcohol as you'd feed a 
baby soothing syrup?" 

M'Bassi waved an expressive 
pink-palmed hand at the group. 
"Babies," he said. "I prescribe it. 
We must try something, and do 
it soon. The only alternative is 
narcotics from the first-aid, in 
large doses. If there's enough to 
go around, we'd become raging 
addicts." 

."We don't know if there's 
enough alcohol," Braithewaite 
pointed out. "Borg couldn't have 
secreted much." 

I shook Borg's shoulders 
roughly. His head lolled over and 
he opened red-veined eyes. 

"Where is it? Where do. you 
keep your liquor?" 

He smiled feebly. "Wouldn't, 
you like to know, son? Go away." 

"How much have you got 
cached? We feel like a drink 
ourselves." 

He sat up and looked around 
Wearily. "That's different. I figured you were all blue noses because I was the only one who 
brought any aboard.' I finished 
that way back, but I got plenty 
more. Plenty. More'n you could 
drink in a year of pub-crawling." 

Of course there was plenty. 
That was arranged by Sam long 
ago. No mass expedition, no 



moronic minds, but a few of the 
best — with their higher centers 
temporarily dulled. 

BORG weaved out of the door 
with drunken benevolent gestures to us to follow. 

I had the crazy idea he might 
be distilling it. That was just 
possible, using ration fruit bars. 
Where? Practically any place 
away from our quarters. We 
weren't cramped for space. The 
Boomerang was a rabbit-warren. 
It wouldn't have been overmanned with a crew of a few 
hundred, and there were only 
seven of us. 

The machinery installed to replace crew — rob-mechs of fantastic omniscience, competence 
and cost — occupied only fractional space. A full-scale distillery could have been set up 
somewhere in the miles of convoluted steel guts of the ship. 

She'd been started as a 
generation -to -generation vessel. 
An entire self-contained colonizing community was to have 
boarded her, with the hope that 
their great - great - great - grandchildren would get to some star 
on straight atomic drive. 

That might have been better. 
Time and a common, recognized 
destiny would have welded them 
into racial and political homogeneity. But when the new drive 
was discovered, it was cheaper to 



UNIVERSITY 



71 



install it in this vast, near-empty 
hull than build another. The 
drive disregarded mass, could 
move or "translate" a mountain 
as easily as a molehill. 

Still, the Boomerang could be 
carrying hundreds instead of a 
mere seven political and scientific 
guinea pigs. 

Six guinea pigs — and yourself, 
Statlen, said a timeless whisper. 

I stumbled on M'Bassi's heels 
as we filed into yet another 
empty, echoing corridor. He halfturned with a forgiving grin. 

"This calls for fullest exercise 
of your descriptive powers, Statlen. Here we are, seven mature 
representatives of a race that's 
reaching out for the Universe, and 
we're running away from our own 
presumption. Running away from 
the stars — in search of a drink." 

Aventos, just behind me, said 
quietly and without blasphemy: 
". . . and on the sixth day, God 
took time off from Creation to 
slip into the nearest saloon for a 
shot of rye." 

Lao T'Sung said: "You think 
we're playing at being God?" 

"We're playing at being men. 
At the moment we all want to 
go home to Mother. We think 
we're grown up, making our way 
in the world. But we're still tied 
to her apron strings." 

M'Bassi's voice boomed back 



in the corridor. "Mother Earth, 
eh? A startlingly fresh application of the ancient Jungian psychology." 

Borg stopped in front of a redpainted sliding door, fumbled 
with a complicated catch. "Open 
Sesame !" 

Cans were stacked in clamped 
piles inside. 

"The Boomerang," said Borg, 
"is a complete ship. The emergency chemical jets may never 
have to be used. If they are, 
there's sufficient for five minute's 
blasting in the tanks. And if that's 
not enough, here's a reserve." 

Brodcuzynski looked at the 
symbols on the cans and uttered 
a few wondering cusswords. 
"Look what that Dane's been 
drinking! Don't anyone give Borg 
a cigarette or he'll jet off clean 
out of his boots." 

"Not neat, of course," Borg 
agreed. "Recipe is one-third absolute, one-third water, one-third 
fruit juice. No fusel oils or other 
rotgut products after distillation. 
Just plain, pure ethyl alcohol. It 
makes terrific cocktails. I've tried 
it with lemon, bay leaves, tomato 
ketchup, aniseed and milk so far. 
It curdles the milk. But let's 
experiment." 

HPHAT had been four hours 
ago, ship time. 
The pickling process with men 
obviously unused to alcohol had 



72 




 



been rapid. And they weren't in 
prime physical condition, though 
you wouldn't guess it, looking at 
the exertions of Brodcuzynski 
and M'Bassi. 

Their reactions were slowed, 
high centers dulled. 

Nicely timed. In about an hour 
according to the clock in my mind 
— the only possible measurement 
in this case — they would be in 
the passive stage, quietly happy 
or maybe maudlin, according to 
temperament. And receptive. 

f deceptive to what? 

M'Bassi quit his thumping, 
came over to my desk and grabbed the edge to steady himself. 
"You don' look too good, son. 
What's troublin' you?" 

"Wish I knew," I said, and 
meant it. I rubbed the back of my 
head. "There's something ticking 
away here, and the ticks are getting closer together." 

He laughed. "Sonarscope, maybe. Or that's an egg and you've 
got something hatching inside 
there waitin' to bust out. Don't 
worry, boy. Have some more 
snake-milk." 

I shot the drink down with a 
grimace. But the ticking went on, 
irritating, irregular, quickening, 
like a geiger counter approaching 
a radioactive source. 

Within the hour it had become 
a continuous susurration. 



A few seconds after the alarm 
signal vibrated through the messroom, it stopped abruptly. 

The observation screen flared 
white and blank, pseudo- gravity 
ceased with the cutting of the 
drive-field, and the simple instruments rimming the screen showed 
the impossible: zero readings all 
around. 
The Boomerang was at rest. 

I saw the necessity for the 
relaxing .alcohol now. 

Two billion tons of metal being 
translated at more-than-light velocity can't come to a dead stop. 

But it had. 

And alcohol cushioned the 
mind against that fact. And 
against other things. 

"Pink elephants!" Aventos 
breathed. He turned a slow cartwheel in front of the screen and 
solemnly regarded the dials upside down. "I don't believe it." 

Braithewaite pointed to the 
thing that was growing slowly in 
the middle of the messroom. 
"Thass not pink," he said carefully, "and it's not an ephelant." 

Sam stabilized himself at half 
his full size and looked around. 
He saw me and smiled. 

"Having fun?" he asked vocally in English. 

I'd waited four thousand years 
for that trigger. Now I remembered. 

"Nice body," Sam approved. 
"Can you still semblize?"

"Give me time," I said. "It's 
been quite a while." 

"We'll shift the whole heap 
down to the — what's the word?" 

"Campus," I supplied. 

" — campus, and give these 
good gentlemen a little gravity 
before they lose their last meal." 

A T the farther end of the Hall, 
the statue of Athena hadn't 
changed since I last saw it. The 
Eternal Light still burned as 
brightly from the alabaster of 
that vast, high forehead. Not surprising, considering it had a halflife of two million years. 

I gave her a perfunctory nod 
and half a wink. We revere wisdom, not its symbols. But she 
impresses the customers. 

Sam, to me, direct: No Greek? 

English universal tongue now. 

Barbaric. 

You get it? 

In clear. Help out with odd 
term. 

Vocally, to the six: "Gentlemen, as — " 
President. 

" — president of this establishment, I welcome you and trust 
that your stay will be pleasant. 
Mr. Statlen will continue to act 
as your mentor and guide and I 
shall be available at any time if 
you wish for any .further information and — " 

Enlightenment. 

Filthy concatenation of sylla


bles, that. Don't like." 

" — enlightenment." 

"If this be Valhalla, I recogize no gods," muttered Borg suddenly. I thought it was a misplaced sense of the dramatic until 
I realized he was quoting. He 
strode forward and poked at 
Sam's shoulder. 

"I'm all here," Sam said politely. 

"That's more than I am, mister." 

"And my name isn't — " 
Bearded mythological gatekeeper? 
St. Peter. 

"—isn't St. Peter. I realize you 
must be upset and confused by 
the suddenness of this arisement, 
but we find it psychologically 
unwise to allow reason to intervene by doing things more gradually." 

"Upset?" Braithewaite laughed 
shortly. "That's the ultimate understatement." 

IT^HEY were sobering up fast, 
but alcohol still put a protective haze over their higher 
faculties. 

"If it's real," M'Bassi said, 
"I'm due for a galaxy-size hangover." 

"Where are we?" asked Lao 
bluntly. Drinking rice wine in his 
youth had given him a hard and 
intensely practical head. 

"A planet," Sam replied.

"Impossible. Our retranslation 
into the normal continuum could 
not have taken place so near 
planetary mass." 

"So near? You were a lightmonth distant when our field encompassed you." 

"Stopped us and brought us 
here within ten minutes?" 

"An arbitrary measure of 
time." 

"What system is this?" 

"One far removed from your 
own." 

"Our range was five light-years. 
Centaurus — " 

"Your range was far greater 
than you were permitted to imagine. Even had it been less, you 
would have been broiight within 
the aegis of- this establishment. 
And now, gentlemen, please allow 
Mr. Statlen to conduct you to 
your quarters. Time for questions 
and work after you've rested." 

CAM abruptly semblized him^ self elsewhere and left me to 
face the growing storm. 

I'm afraid Aventos was the 
first to display terrestrial chauvenism and a lamentable lack of 
intellectual discipline. 

"I suppose you can vanish like 
that, you bloody spy?" 

I laughed at the use of the 
term. "I've nearly forgotten, but 
I'll be getting into practice again. 
The word 'spy' implies conflict. 
There's no conflict here. You're 



safe and you'll be made comfortable." 

Brodcuzynski spoke for the 
first time. Despite his silvered 
hair, he was the youngest in 
heart. He was still happy-drunk. 
He had wandered away to study 
the decorated wall panels. He'd 
even spoken to a student scurrying through the Hall to look at 
the Boomerang. She smiled, 
psyched him quickly, gave his 
head a benedictory pat, and hurried on to join her quietly amused 
colleagues in the doorway. None 
of them had paused to look at our 
group. 

Brod rejoined us. "Nice place," 
he said. "Coeducational, too. Umum. Don't tell my wife." 

Thank Athena for Brod at that 
moment. 

The temporary easing of suspicion gave me time to usher 
them to their adjoining rooms. 

"Take a nap, freshen up, then 
we'll eat," I said. 

Aventos sat on the edge of his 
couch. His normally olive face 
was pale. "Where is it?" 

"Out along the corridor to the 
left. Marked with an unmistakable symbol." 

"We're not prisoners?" 

"Go where you like, Juan. But 
I'd advise you to rest." 

He put his head in his hands 
and looked sick and miserable. 

When I reported to Sam later, 
he was giving instructions for 



UNIVERSITY 



75 



the Boomerang to be parked elsewhere. 

Direct: "Litters up the place. 
What a ship! A power hammer 
to crack a nut. Initially a colonizer?" 

"Yes." 

"You did well, Stat." 

"No thanks to me. Does conditioning take everything into 
account, every conceivable deviation?" 

"No. You automatically apply 
correction." 



"Interference?" 

"Of course not. Unconscious 
participation to a worthy end. 
Do you recall no example?" 

I thought back. "A statesmanthinker, Francis Bacon . . . Yes, 
I started trend." 

"Completed?" 

"No. Still mind-matter bifurcation." 

Sam: "Obvious, from that ungainly hulk of metal. Will they 
get through?" 

Doubt. Hope. "I like them." 



76 




 



Sam, amusement: "They don't 
like you. They'll like you less 
afterward. Tough job." 

Myself, deprecation concept : 
"Would be, if I were conscious of 
performing it." 

"Return if necessary?" 

"Certainly. Was writing imaginative fiction. Helps a little, I 
believe." 

r¥"iHE six were observed during 
their unrestrained wanderings. 
I took part and scanned them 



myself during one particular 
sleep-period, the greater part of 
which they spent in Lao T'Sung's 
room, framing questions. Aventos 
called it a "council of war." 

On the following day-start, I 
took them to Assembly in the 
Hall. Despite exercise therapy, 
they still showed signs of mental 
wear and physical dissipation. 
But Brodcuzynski was still irrepressible. 

He looked at a group of students from Mizra III, tall,, uni

formly blonde, in purple gowns. 
"Magnificent!" 

M'Bassi surprise4 me. "Don't 
fool yourself, Brod. They probably regard you as a mentally 
retarded savage from a cesspool 
planet." 

"That came hard, didn't it, 
M'Bassi?" I asked quietly. 

"It's obvious. The only possible 
conclusion to fit the facts. The 
others don't agree, but — " He 
shrugged his massive black 
shoulders. "My branch of the 
race suffered imposed inferiority 
for so long that my ego isn't outraged by the assumption, unlike 
Juan Aventos and Lao T'Sung, 
who seem to be taking the dignity 
of the entire race on their shoulders." 

True dignity can never be pathetic, even when it lacks substance for its assertion. 

But I smiled within when Lao 
marched up to the rostrum beneath the representation of 
Athena and raised his voice to 
Sam: "Let's stop this farce! Why 
are we here? Where is this place? 
What is the purpose of this gathering? If this is some form of 
religious ceremony — " 

A vocal buzz of surprise arose 
from the students as they put out 
psych-prongs to Lao and grasped 
— or failed to gra,sp — his meaning. 

Even though he knew it was 
coming, Sam was a little embar


i 

rassed. There had been few such 
interruptions during the million 
years of his presidency. £ 
"I regretful — " Sam began. ijj 
Word, quickly. That's incorrect. 

Just say you're sorry. 

"I'm sorry you should chose ^ 
this moment to question me, Mr. 1 
Lao. I have told you that you .'ithave access to me at any time. |s 
And this is not religion. I can f 
see your concept dimly. You are ,<fi 
not—" 

Sam fumbled impatiently in 
my mind. Abrogating, I told him. 
It's a soothing vocalization. $f 

" — abrogating one whit of your '|j 
particular individual or racial su- § 
perstition — " 

Attention, Sam. That's wrong. 
Use belief. 

" — beliefs by attending this little ceremony. We are merely dedicating the new day to a chase of 
knowing." 

Sam plucked the words from 
me before I could indicate correct usage, and tried metaphor in 
an unknown tongue — a very 
chancy business. 

Pursuit of wisdom. 

Doesn't matter. He gets the 
idea. 

Lao did. He returned to our 
group, sat in hard-faced silence 
until the brief business was finished, students had dispersed and 
seats which were not being used 
had sunk again into the floor.

When Sam came up to us, grayhaired old Braithewaite chuckled 
at a sudden recollection. 

"In walk and general demeanor," he said, "you might be the 
twin brother of my tutor at Oxford." 

A classical university. 

Sam grinned back. "I take that 
as a compliment. You were a student of Greek?" 

"A poor one." 

"But you recognize our emblem?" 

"I've seen similar representations of Athena, allegoricized as a 
symbol of wisdom.' 

f f A WHIM on the part of our 
first expedition. They 
brought her back some four thousand of your years ago. She replaced an earlier symbol from 
another solar system, and has remained our favorite since, although we have a choice of five 
hundred or more similar symbols 
from the mythologies of other 
planets. Our second expedition 
placed Mr. Statlen among you." 

"Are we to believe he's as old 
as that?" Aventos demanded, 
looking at me with bleak-eyed 
suspicion. 

Reply, Stat. 

"In effect, considerably older," 
I said. "But until yesterday, I 
had no memories beyond those 
of the thirty-odd years I've spent 
in this particular body; and I 



\ 

didn't know that I was anything 
other than what I seemed." 

"The essence of what is loosely 
called mind or ego was, in Mr. 
Statlen's case, rendered transferable," Sam explained. "The 
faculty was unconscious, together 
with memories of its endowment and its eventual purposes. 
The awareness of an observer 
becomes a factor in his observations, so awareness was 
suppressed. 

"When intervention of a kind 
at last became necessary, Mr. 
Statlen became- the unconscious 
transmitter of certain impulses 
which subtly influenced the 
course of events. 

"A devious method of achieving our ends, but a more direct \ 
means would defeat our purpose." 

"And what is that purpose?" 
Aventos asked. 

"To ascertain without its 
knowledge whether a race has 
achieved a degree of civilization 
commensurate with its material 
and scientific advancement. Civilization lies in the hearts and 
minds of men, not in their works. 
You've developed interstellar 
travel, but are you fit to use it? 
Are you fit to — graduate?" 

M'Bassi widened his broad 
nostrils. "If Statlen's the bossboy and he's been around so long, 
why not ask him?" 

"Neither Mr. Statlen nor his 



UNIVERSITY 



79 



innumerable colleagues are able 
to communicate with us, or we 
with them. That would negate 
the non-intervention principle. 
Their sole task — mainly unconscious — is to insure that suitable 
representatives of an aspiring 
race are brought here for examination when they develop an interstellar drive." 

"And suppose they don't make 
the grade?" 

"What happens under your 
own curiously varied education 
system if a student fails an entrance examination? We can't 
press the analogy too close, but 
doesn't he return to junior or 
public or elementary school?" 

Aventos stepped closer. "Quit 
dodging. You say all this is done 
without the knowledge of the 
race. But we've been brought 
here. So we know. So what happens to us and our ship?" 

Aventos' death-fear was almost 
a physical pain in Sam's mind 
and mine. 

CAM gave him a quick soothe ^ probe. "You are sent back," 
he said gently. "Your memories 
of this period are erased and replaced by the conviction that 
your expedition has failed, that 
your ship did not emerge at all 
from its probability state into the 
normal continuum. 

"You will have been nowhere, 
seen nothing. Your drive will be 



altered to put you on a false and 
infinitely complex mathematical 
trail. This, and the vast cost of 
experimentation, together with 
subtly hindering influences unconsciously transmitted by the 
mentor delegated to your planet, 
will guarantee that no further 
major attempts are made for several centuries." 

Sam was becoming positively 
pedantic in his use of this new 
language. 

Direct: more to this tongue 
than I suspected. Good flowing 
periods possible. 

Borg, who'd been standing 
quietly enough, fingering his fair 
beard and gazing at Athena, said 
suddenly in his deep bull voice: 
"By what right do you arrogate 
these powers to yourselves, whatever you may be?" 

"The simple right of exclusion, 
which has no moral, ethical or 
legal basis, but is applied as a 
matter of common sense. Statlen 
informs me you are a professor of 
comparative philology at Harvard University. 

"Suppose a five-year-old child 
from a village school demanded 
the right to enter your classes, 
sit in on your lectures, avail himself of your library. You wouldn't 
even question whether he'd benefit. You'd take him firmly by the 
ear, lead him outside, tell him 
to come back when he'd gone 
through the grades and high 



80 




 



school and college, or however 
you term the progressive units in 
your educational system. 

"Even if he protested that, despite his behavior in fighting 
other kids and breaking your 
windows with his slingshot, he 
was really quite grown up and a 
hidden genius and fascinated by 
comparative philology, would you 
take his word for it?" 

"A fantastic and degrading analogy," Lao said coldly. "You 
can't equate a race with an individual in such an incredibly 
cavalier manner." 

"But we can and do," said 
Sam. 

HE had endowed himself with 
the physiognomy of an ancient 
Roman emperor for the benefit 
of the six. He rubbed the highbridged nose as he spoke. "By our 
standards, you are a young race. 
You may have advanced sufficiently to be permitted at least 
to study here. That is what we 
must ascertain. 

"As I indicated, the empathy 
index weighs more heavily with 
us than the intelligence quotient. 
I understand that your mental 
and physical sciences are still 
largely divided. That doesn't 
promise well for you. 

"Until a race achieves a synthesis, an integrated system recognizing the indivisibility of 
mind-matter concepts, its natural 



chauvinism cannot be sublimated. 
It remains the child of conflict. 

"That attitude is useful, even 
necessary, in the infancy of the 
race, when survival is the only 
criterion. But if the race carries 
that attitude into maturity, it becomes dangerous to itself — and, 
unfortunately, to others, because 
its intransigeance is implemented 
by the weapons of material maturity. 

"We don't claim to know the 
purpose of the Universe, except, 
perhap»r-that its purpose is to divine its own purpose. But we do 
know that fire and the sword are 
not the tools for that fundamental 
research." 

Stand by, Stat. Test coming. 
Psych all six and cross-check 
with me. 

In clear. Hold Brodcuzynski or 
trauma possible. 

Brod was still thinking in a 
vague and delightfully pagan 
way about the Mizra people. 

Sam resumed his vocalizing to 
the six: "You find this difficult 
to grasp. A demonstration is more 
effective than many words." 

Sam, direct to A'hig Onefour, 
who was standing by the right 
hand of Athena watching the six 
Terrestrials in amused fascination: Come. 

One of the tall, blonde Mizra 
students who was standing by the 
right hand of Athena came across 
Hall toward our group. She halt

ed, smiling, within the half-circle 
we formed. 

In Earth terms : Aphrodite newrisen from caressing, milky-crested waves, an Amazonian Helen, 
a brazen Psyche, a Pompadour in 
free-limbed sports rig, a sexed 
angel, an aggregation of impossible but somehow attainable

aura of concupiscence — 

A'hig Onefour played the part 
well. 

Brodcuzynski : My God, what

Sam, vocally, and direct to 
A'hig: "Would you please resume your natural form, Miss 
A'hig relinquishing that which 
• you and your colleagues adopted 
for the mental convenience of 
these gentlemen?" 

Badly put, Sam. Gross connotation. 

Doesn't matter. Psych them. 
I'm holding Brod together. 

And the blonde, the leggy 
blonde, the luscious blonde, became in slow dissolve — 

— using transliterated universal 
terms — 

— a multi-sexed, commendably 
developed brachialiferous thase, 
with its fifteen specialized arms

All stemmed from a"n acceptably odd oblate spheroid; a 
sweetly esthetic organization of 
functional necessity. Its very 
truth -in-purpose was beautiful 
. . . This language is so limited in 
its conceptual terminology. 

The psychic storm from the 
others nearly overwhelmed me, 
smashing like the ravening tumble of a cloudburst. 



T WAS sick, bedeviled, racked 
by fear, shaken by hate, until 
Sam put out a calming thought. 

You're identifying yourself, 
Stat. Come away, Help me psych 
and tabulate. i 

I withdrew and touched only 
what came to the surface. 

Brodcuzynski : Mental scream

. . . Can't exist . . . Shouldn't exist

Sam struck in with his musical, 
little-used voice. It cut through 
the welter of near-madness. I 
heard only snatches of it in my 
own intense preoccupation: ". . . 
highest life-form on four planets 
of a system ... specialization . . . 
beautiful, is it not?" 

Aventos: Christ, planets 
swarming with them! . . . the star

. . . Leaping creature, spear, kill 
or be killed . . . Redness and insane delight. 

Lao T'sung : Quick control, but 
vivid picture of heel squashing 
snake before blankout, and another obscene unverbalized picture. 

It was as though every racial 
hatred and fear of difference that 
had ever beset mankind welled 
up in a suppurating flow from 
their minds. 

Scientific curiosity and thus 
conscious sanity returned within 
seconds. But to Sam and me it 
seemed hours. 

Sam said: "I'm sorry to sifbject 
you to this, gentlemen, but we 
wanted immediate unconscious 
reactions. Had you been prepared, some of you might have retained rational control, according 
to your degree of advancement 
beyond atavistic xenophobia. But 
we are interested only in the 
degree of empathic rapport with 
other intelligences. 

Sam called up a chair from the 
floor of the Hall and sat in it 
casually. Our group was alone 
now in the vasthess of the Hall. 
A'hig, myself, and the six remained standing. 

SAM stroked his Roman nose 
again and tried to explain. 
"Suppose your colonizing vessel 



had landed on one of the planets 
inhabited by A'hig's fellows, and 
they had suddenly semblized near 
you, would the hand controlling 
your weapons be restrained by 
reason? Possibly. But fear might 
trigger the weapon, even if you 
were otherwise well-protected. 

"Suppose they approached you 
slowly and with circumspection, 
apparently in awe at your mastery of time and space, showing 
what you would take to be due 
humility in face of your technical achievements, could you 
learn to live in peace and cooperation with such — monsters? Especially when you learned they 
were your vast superiors in mental science? Yes, you say, but I 
doubt it. And there must be no 
doubt in such matters. You do 
not, it seems, know yourselves." 
He sighed. "Such a simple lesson, 
so long in the learning." 

"Totally unfair!" Aventos 
blurted. "A farcial test, springing 
something like that. Not that we 
concede you have any damned 
right to make any kind of test 
at all." 

"You confirm my views. Pride 
is a tiger and vanity its teeth." 
Sam, pleased with Lao T'Sung's 
quick control, had gone deep 
within him and found that proverb. " 'Unfair' and 'concede' mean 
nothing to us." 

Direct: Off now, Stat. Reporting to Top. Not unpleased, but

long, long yet. Take them. Unlearning the tongue. Find it slightly distasteful now. 

'"the question, gentlemen," 
Sam murmured, "is not whether 
the Universe is fit for Man, but 
whether Man is fit for the Universe. You have answered it. He 
is not— yet." 

He gestured toward shining 
Athena. "Know yourselves. Then 
return." 

He semblized himself to his 
room. 

Poor A'hig Onefour was becoming a little embarrassed. I sent a 
quick pleasure-scale to her-his-its 
vibration - mathematic - entertainment preen. Not so laughably 
removed from a wolf-whistle. 
Beautiful creature. 

Direct: Gratitude. That's all. 
Semblize off. Stay as sweet as 
you are. 

Query your meaning. Esthetic 
appreciation? ■ 

Sorry. Yes. Earth sexual. Habit. 
Thanks again. 

A'hig semblized. 

Braithewaite scratched his gray 
thatch. "What about this socalled examination?" 

"You've been undergoing it 



since you arrived. You've just 
failed your Finals. So — back to 
school, kids." 

Ahh, get away from me, you 
dirty black. You stink. 

Jim, Jim, there's a spider in the

(delicate legs, sensitive quivering 
palps, a thousand diamonds for

porcelain.) 

You lousy no-account halfbreed. 

I regret that our generous offer

journey, be sure to take along 
this handy little legal guide.

Principle of self -punishment: 
provided the court concurs, any

3380, 84 Un. 793) 

PAUL KILGORE was a 
Terran pilot who was 
scheduled to make the first 
solo hop, in a faster-than-light 
craft, from Pluto to Alpha Centauri. Celebrating the coming 
event at the Universal Joint, a 
spacemen's hangout on Mars, he 
met a former shipmate. He testi

fied at his trial that, after a nebulous number of Venus vapor 
cocktails, he agreed to drop his 
friend off at Pluto. 

Kilgore said that while they 
were passing through the Asteroid Belt, between Mars and Jupiter, he discovered that the flap 
of the kit attached to his uniform 
was open. Anxiously, he felt in 
the pocket. It was empty. His 
doppler pills, compounded especially for his projected flight, 
were missing. He testified that 
he searched the entire ship and 
failed to find the pills. Then, with 
growing suspicion and rage, he 
looked at his snoring passenger. 

He shook the limp figure of his 
friend and angrily asked if the 
latter had swallowed the pills. The 
friend made no answer except a 
foolish grin. Kilgore claimed that 
this was too much for him. Vengefully, he jammed his friend into 
a spacesuit and dumped him on 
one of the 50,000 or more milethick asteroids. Each pill, Kilgore testified, would hold up 
metabolism across 130 lightyears. Long before the drug wore 
off, Kilgore said he believed, 
someone would come across his 
sleeping friend. 

Still fuming, Kilgore returned 
to Mars for a new supply of the 
pills. His first stop was the Universal Joint. He testified that the 
bartender seemed glad to see him 
and handed him a small pill box. 



The bartender said that Kilgore 
had dropped it there. 

When it came time for the 
judge to pronounce sentence, Kilgore asked to be allowed to impose his own punishment. The 
judge was surprised, but he heard 
Kilgore out. And he sanctioned 
the penalty, a harsher penalty 
than he had intended to impose. 

Kilgore spent the remainder of 
his life hunting the sleeping body 
of the man he had marooned on 
one of the myriad asteroids. 



Psychic guilt: fitting the punishment to the criminal supersedes fitting the punishment to 
the crime. (People v. Nica, 3286, 
70 Un. 1245) 

TN the lobby of the Jovian hostel at which he was staying, 
Bor Nica, a Sagittarian, brushed 
against another guest, an Antarean. The Antarean, being unused to the gravity of Jupiter, 
fell and bruised himself considerably. When he had struggled 
up again, however, instead of rebuking Nica for jostling him and 
not offering to assist him to his 
feet, he passed the incident off 
lightly. He was about to hop on 
his way again when Nica, in an 
insane rage, felled him with a 
blow. This time the fall was fatal. 

Nica, instead of trying to escape, waited expectantly beside

the body until a nickel led him 
off to detention. (Note: by 2012 
U.E., inflation had caused nickel 
to replace copper as the designation for an officer of the law.) 
There he remained, happily 
awaiting trial, until word reached 
him that the widow of the Antarean he had murdered harbored 
no hatred for him, and had indeed forgiven him. 

Infuriated, Nica broke out of 
his cell, located the widow and 
killed her, too. Again he waited 
beside the body of his victim. 
And again he not only did not 




resist arrest, but seemed to welcome it. 

Smiling, he pleaded guilty to 
both murders and listened eagerly for the verdict. But the judge 
deferred passing sentence until 
sociologists could go into Nica's 
background for a clue to his 
seemingly illogical actions. 

They found that Nica's society 
had stabilized itself on a mass 
psychosis. Because of atrocities 
his people had committed in their 
history, they had piled up a vast 
unpaid debt of guilt. This weighed so heavily on them that every 
normal individual in Nica's society had a compulsion to seek 
punishment. 

Th e j ud ge studied this report. He 
reasoned that the greatest punishment Nica could receive would 
be no punishment. Any penalty 
he could impose would only gratify Nica instead of punishing 
him. 

Therefore he set Nica free. 

Frantic, Nica appealed the 
court's judgment, but in vain. 
The Galactic Tribunal held that 
he could not place himself in 
double jeopardy. The Jovians deported Nica to his home planet. 
There he remained an outcast 
because of his humiliating failure 
to obtain the punishment they 
all sought. His honor was not restored until he bribed a passing 
Cygnian to shoot him in a carefully contrived hunting accident.

Pro rata sentencing: terms of 
penal servitude are to be based 
upon comparative Hie expectancy. (Peop/e v. Gund, 3286, 70 
Un. 1245) 

|"N the park on the vacation 
satellite orbiting around Altair VII was the body of a Vegan, 
beaten to death. Beside him lay 
the carcass of his pet ululu, also 
beaten to death. Erdo Gund, a 
Procyoni, voluntarily gave himself up. At his trial, Gund's deposition, which he had signed by 
impressing his noseprint, was offered in evidence by the prosecutor. 

In this deposition, Gund admitted killing the pet's master — 
but not the pet. In fact, he stated, 
his motive for killing the master 
was the anger he felt when he 
saw the Vegan brutally beating 
the pet. He struck the Vegan 
down when the cumulative effect 
of witnessing nearly two hours 
of the master's cruelty and the 
pet's pain had proved unbearable. 

At this point the judge interrupted the reading of the deposition. He said he had understood 
other witnesses to state that the 
Vegan's fatal beating of the ululu had lasted only ten minutes 
at most. 

The prosecutor said that His 
Honor was correct in his understanding. But, he said, the depo



sition was accurate, too. He 
explained to the judge that, to the 
Terran-type observer, the ProcyOni's span of life averaged two 
Earth years. In that length of 
time, the Procyoni lived — subjectively — as long as a centenarian Earthman. 

The prosecutor further said 
that in view of all the circumstances, he was of the opinion 
that .Gund could not plead "not 
guilty by reason of temporary 
insanity." However, added the 
prosecutor, he would ask His 
Honor to be lenient and take 
into account the temporal differential. 

The judge followed the prosecutor's recommendation and sentenced Gund to 30 Earth hours 
of psychic guilt.

Semantic jurisprudence : that 
branch of the law which systematizes forensic debate on questions of meaning. ([/. of Venus v. 
Vac. Inc. et al, 2937, 63 Un. 8451) 

^ITAC, Inc., was a Terran corpo* ration supplying the vacuum 
of space for use in laboratory research. At its plant on Luna, it 
manufactured its product by 
welding two duralloy hemispheres 
lip to lip and thus sealing a vacuum inside the globe they formed. 

One container in a shipment to 
the University of Venus proved 
to be defective. The University 
sued for damages resulting from 
sudden failure of the built-in valve. 
These damages included the tearing of the elbow-beard of a visiting Ganymedean professor, which 
had been sucked into the globe. 

Attorney for the defendants 
asked for dismissal of the suit 
on the grounds that a vacuum 
was nothing, and that when both 
parties to the action had stipulated the loss of a vacuum, the 
plaintiff in effect admitted losing 
nothing. In support of this contention, attorney for the defandants exhibited the advertising 
slogan of Vac, Inc., "Nothing — 
but the best!" 

Attorney for the plaintiff countered the dismissal motion by 
stating that if this were true, then 
the defendants were confessing to 
the inequity of giving nothing in 




exchange for good hard cash. 
However, attorney for the plaintiff argued, no absolute vacuum 
exists in all space, there being a 
minimum of twelve molecules per 
cubic foot in the emptiest reaches. Therefore, she claimed, there 

' is nothing in the Universe which 
one might name "nothing." 

That last statement, attorney 
for the defendants replied scornfully, was self-contradictory. 
"Nothing" ex/srs, he said; the 
space between the molecules is 
"nothing." 

Quickly, attorney for the plaintiff exclaimed that now her learned opponent was arguing on the 
side of her client by agreeing that 
"nothing" is something. 

% At this point the judge wearily 
recessed court, declaring that he 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC LAW

intended to damp his brain waves 
with tonic chord therapy. 

As soon as court reconvened, 
the judge asked if either party 
objected to the swearing in of a 
panel of semanticists. There was 
no objection. And so, before deciding on the dismissal motion, 
the judge submitted the problem 
to the panel. 

With a squad of burly bailiffs 
keeping order among the venerable semanticists, the question finally came to a vote. 

The majority decided that a 
vacuum is "something." 

The judge denied the defendants' motion for dismissal, heard 
the case, and found for the plaintiff. He awarded to the University 
40 million credits. But legal expenses and the adverse publicity 
bankrupted Vac, Inc. 

It paid nothing. 



Law of identity: any judgment 
of the court is a true judgment in 
all succeeding cases where the 
circumstances are the same. 
(Smith v. General Teletote, 3016, 
24 Un. 612) 

JAK SMITH, a clerk in the 
Titan branch of the First Solar Bank & Trust Co., filed a civil 
suit against General Teletote. He 
sought to recover damages for, 
injuries he had sustained while 



j 

utilizing the facilities of the passenger division of that firm. 

Under a governmental Class F , 
priority (his heart could not j 
stand the strain of spaceship travel), he had returned to his native i 
Terra via teletote. He charged .j 
General Teletote with garbling j 
him in transmission. 

General Teletote admitted that 
its tri-dimensional scanner had 
reassembled Smith improperly. 
The firm also conceded that its j 
Terran operator had been out on k 
a pan jo drunk, leaving the receptor controls untended and incorrectly adjusted — - permitting J 
electronic snow to piebald Smith. \ 

But though it acknowledged its | 
carelessness, General Teletote 
firmly disclaimed any liability. 
It produced the customary waiver 




92 




 



that Smith had signed prior to 
transmission, absolving General 
Teletote of all responsibility for 
mishap in transit and/or upon 
reception. 

Smith replied that as he was 
now obviously not the same individual who had signed the 
waiver, its terms were not binding on him. 

General Teletote answered that 
if Smith was not the same individual, he could not claim damages in the other's name. 

Having studied the briefs, the 
Galactic Tribunal ruled that even 
by the signing of a ~waiver, an 
individual cannot divest himself 
of his inalienable right to his own 
identity. 

Smith had just won his case 
when the "ghost image" of Smith 
came forward, pressing claims for 
a like award. To prove these 
claims, the ghost image produced 
witnesses who testified that 
Smith 2 had emerged from the receptor shortly after Smithy although records failed to show any 
other transmission scheduled for 
that time and place. 

Smith! struggled for sole possession of his identity. He sided 
with General Teletote in its attempts to disprove Smith 2 's physical appearance by saying that 
the latter was merely a partial 
albino who saw a good chance to 
cash in on the accidental resemblance. 



The battle ended suddenly one 
day in court when the judge intervened, pointing but that both 
had equally good evidence, that 
there was no doubt that they were 
the same man, and asked them to 
effect a compromise. Otherwise, 
the judge explained, the case 
would result in a deadlock. Smithi 
and Smith 2 quickly came to a, 
settlement. 

The two set up a partnership 
with the credits they collected 
and established a firm which became the foremost competitor of 
General Teletote. 



Doctrine of excusable fraud: 
deception, when welcomed by the 
victimized party, comes within 
the realm of caveat emptor. 
(Based on a quashed indictment, 
3426 C/.E.) 

T TNTIL he worked his great 
coup, Conway Limbeck was 
a minor criminal preying on the 
gullible-minded and larcenoushearted. He sold interests in a 
formula for synthesizing ambidextrose sugar. For years he 
thrived on this formula, which 
was more than his victims could 
claim. At the time he dreamed up 
his brilliant stroke, he was chief 
steward aboard a Sirius-bound 
liner. Thanks to forged credentials, he was making a getaway 



ORIGINS OF GALACTIC LAW 



93 



in the most comfortable style. 

While the liner was approaching Sirius XIII, a passenger 
gave Limbeck a fifty credit tip. 
Limbeck examined the note. It 
gave him ideas. He stole into 
the chart room and trimmed the 
blank edges from the astronautical maps. These plastic strips 
had the official heat mark imbedded in them. Then Limbeck 
burgled enough photo supplies to 
counterfeit the strips into notes 
amounting to Cr. 3 trillion. 

When the liner landed on Sirius 
XIII, Limbeck hastened to the 
Presidential Shack. Convincing 
credentials vouching for Limbeck 
as representative plenipotentiary 
of the Io Trading Trust gained 
him immediate admittance. After 
the ceremonial somersaults were 
exchanged, Limbeck announced 
that the Trust had authorized 
him to negotiate for that season's 
output of tumul. 

The President was . hard-ofsmelling until the interpreter 
wafted that Limbeck had finally 
raised his offer to Cr. 2^ trillion. 
When he gave vent to his great 
satisfaction, the President nearly 
bowled Limbeck over. 

Limbeck chartered a vessel 
with his remaining Cr. 1/2 trillion 
and took off with his precious 
payload. His vessel had hardly 
come out of synergy when the 
Siriutes realized that Limbeck 
had jetted a fast one on them. A 




Sirius XIII patrol intercepted 
and boarded Limbeck's vessel. 
Limbeck's heart sank as he faced 
the boarding party. Then to hi? 
amazement he scented that the 
Siriutes were emitting friendly 
laughs. Their leader passed over 
a new agreement for Limbick to 
sign. It was a contract for tumul 
futures. 

In bewilderment, Limbeck read 
the terms. They were extremely 
favorable to him— especially the 
explicit condition that he was to 
make payment in counterfeit 
credits only. 

The Siriutes told him they 
valued the counterfeit more than 
the genuine. This fetish of theirs, 
they explained, stemmed from the 
darkest age of their history, when 
a tyrant had set himself up 



94 




 



through fraud. The revolutionary 
fervor with which they at last 
overthrew him fired in them a 
passion for skepticism. For this 
reason they treasured symbols of 1 
disbelief. 

Limbeck was more than happy 
to sign the contract. 

But news of the Sirius situation 
outsped his vessel and the GBI 
nailed him. However, the Galactic 
Government had no evidence 
with which to pin the counterfeiting charge on Limbeck, as the 
proud possessors of the fakes had 
hidden them and would not yield 
them up. The most that the government ceuld do was to put a 
brake on his future activities: It 
enjoined him from counterfeiting. 

Sirius XIII demanded that 
Limbeck fulfill the contract. The 
Galactic Tribunal ruled that the

contract was illegal and invalid. 

But the Secretary for Galactic 
defense privately informed Limbeck that he was anxious to see 
the deal come off, as tumul was 
vital to defense. Limbeck, of 
course, was equal to the problem. 

He arranged a secret rendezvous in deep space. The Siriutes and Limbeck exchanged 
tumul and currency. After Limbeck's departure, the Siriutes noticed an inscription beginning to 
appear in each of the notes. The 
inscription read: GENUINE — 
PASSED AS COUNTERFEIT. 

This double fraud doubly delighted the Siriutes and they 
gratefully bestowed upon Limbeck their highest award. 

The medal, of course, was made 
of synthetic platinum.

Escaping your worries is good 
sound medical advice— as long 
as you leave yourself behind! 

By KURT VONNEGUT, JR. 



1 DON'T suppose the oldsters, 
those of us who weren't born 
into it, will ever feel quite 
at home being amphibious — amphibious in the new sense of the 
word. I still catch myself feeling 
blue about things that don't matter any more. 

I can't help worrying about my 
business, for instance — or what 
used to be my business. After all, • 
I spent thirty years building the 



thing up from scratch, and now 
the equipment is rusting and getting clogged with dirt. But even 
though I know it's silly of me 
to care what happens to the business, I borrow a body from a storage center every so often, and go 
around the old home town, and 
clean and oil as much of the 
equipment as I can. 

Of course, all in the world, the 
equipment was good for was mak

ing money, and Lord knows 
there's plenty of that lying 
around. Not as much as there 
used to be, because there at first 
some people got frisky and threw 
it all around, and the wind blew 
it every which way. And a lot of 
go-getters gathered up piles of 
the stuff and hid it somewhere. 
I hate to admit it, but I gathered 
up close to a half million myself 
and stuck it away. I used to get it 
out and count it sometimes, but 
that was years ago. Right now I'd 
be hard put to say where it is. 

But the worrying I do about 
my old business is bush league 
stuff compared to the worrying 
my wife, Madge, does about our 
old house. That thing is what she 
herself put in thirty years on 
while I was building the business. 
Then no sooner had we gotten 
nerve enough to build and decorate the place than everybody 
we cared anything about got amphibious. Madge borrows a body 
once a month and dusts the place, 
though the only thing a house is 
good for now is keeping termites 
and mice from getting pneumonia. 

WHENEVER it's my turn to 
get into a body and work as 
an attendant at the local storage 
center, I realize all over again 
how much tougher it is for women to get used to being amphibious. 



Madge borrows bodies a lot 
oftener than I do, and that's true 
of women in general. We have to 
keep three times as many women's bodies in stock as men's 
bodies, in order to meet the demand. Every so often, it seems 
as though a woman just has to 
have a body, and doll it up in 
clothes, and look at herself in a 
mirror. And Madge, God bless 
her, I don't think she'll be satisfied until she's tried on every 
body in every storage center on 
Earth. 

It's been a fine thing for Madge, 
though. I never kid her about it, 
because it's done so much for her 
personality. Her old body, to tell 
you the plain blunt truth, wasn't 
anything to get excited about, 
and having to haul the thing 
around made her gloomy a lot of 
the time in the old days. She 
couldn't help it, poor soul, any 
more than anybody else could 
help what sort of body they'd 
been born with, and I loved her 
in spite of it. 

Well, after we'd learned to be 
amphibious, and after we'd built 
the storage centers and laid in 
body supplies and opened them 
to the public, Madge went hog 
wild. She borrowed a platinum 
blonde body that had been donated by a burlesque queen, and" 
I didn't think we'd ever get her 
out of it. As I say, it did-wonders 
for her self-confidence. 



UN READY TO WEAR 



99 



I'm like most men and don't 
care particularly what body I 
get. Just the strong, good-looking, 
healthy bodies were put in storage, so one is as good as the 
next one. Sometimes, when 
Madge and I take bodies out together for old times' sake, I let 
her pick out one for me to watch 
whatever she's got on. It's a funny thing how she always picks a 
blond, tall one for me. 

My old body, which she claims 
she loved for a third of a century, 
had black hair, and was short and 
paunchy, too, there toward the 
last. I'm human and I couldn't 
help being hurt when they 
scrapped it after I'd left it, instead of putting it in storage. It 
was a good, homy, comfortable 
body; nothing fast and flashy, 
but reliable. But there isn't much 
call for that kind of body at the 
centers, I guess. I never ask for 
one, at any rate. 

The worst experience I ever 
had with a body was when I was 
flimflammed into taking out the 
one that had belonged to Dr. Ellis Konigswasser. It belongs to 
the Amphibious Pioneers' Society 
and only gets taken out once a 
year but for the big Pioneers' 
Day Parade, on the anniversary 
of Konigswasser'ff discovery. 
Everybody said it was a great 
honor for me to be picked to get 
into Konigswasser's body and 
lead the parade. 



Like a plain damn fool, I believed them. 

qpHEY'LL have a tough time 
getting me into that thing 
again — ever. Taking that wreck 
out certainly made it plain why* 
Konigswasser discovered how 
people could do without their 
bodies. That old one of his practically drives you out. Ulcers, 
headaches, arthritis, fallen arches 
— a nose like a pruning hook, 
piggy little eyes, and a complexion like a used steamer trunk. He 
was and still is the sweetest person you'd ever want to know, 
but, back when he was stuck with 
that body, nobody got close 
enough to find out. 

We tried to get Konigswasser 
back into his old body to lead 
us when we first started having 
the Pioneers' Day Parades, but 
he wouldn't have anything to do 
with it, so we always have to 
flatter some poor boob into taking on the job. Konigswasser 
marches, all right, but as a sixfoot cowboy who can bend beer 
cans double between his thumb 
and middle finger. 

Konigswasser is just like a kid 
with that body. He never gets 
tired of bending beer cans with 
it, and we all have to stand 
around in our bodies after the 
parade, and watch as though we 
were very impressed. 

I don't suppose he could bend 



100 




 



very much of anything back in 
the old days. 

Nobody mentions it to him, 
since he's the grand old man of 
the Amphibious Age, but he plays 
hell with bodies. Almost every 
time he takes one out, he busts 
it, showing off. Then somebody 
has to get into a surgeon's body 
and sew it up again. 

I don't mean to be disrespectful of Konigswasser. As a matter 
of fact, it's a respectful thing to 
say that somebody is childish in 
certain ways, because it's people 
like that who seem to get all the 
big ideas. 

There is a picture of him in 
the old days down at the Historical Society, and you can see from 
that that he never did grow up 
as far as keeping up his appearance went — doing what little he 
could with the rattle-trap body 
Nature had issued him. 

His hair was down below his 
collar, he wore his pants so low 
that his heels wore through the 
legs above the cuffs, and the lining of his coat hung down in 
festoons all around the bottom. 
And he'd forget meals, and go 
out into the cold or wet without 
enough clothes on, and he would 
never notice sickness until it almost killed him. He was. what 
we used to call absent-minded. 
Looking back now, of course, we 
•say he was starting to be amphibious. 



TZ"ONIGSWASSER was a 
mathematician, and he did 
all his living with his mind. The 
body he had to haul around with 
that wonderful mind was about 
as much use to him as a flat car 
of scrap-iron. Whenever he got 
sick and had to pay some attention to his body, he'd rant somewhat like this: 

"The mind is the only thing 
about human beings that's worth 
anything. Why does it have to 
be tied to a bag of skin, blood, 
hair, meat, bones, and tubes? No 
wonder people can't get anything 
done, stuck for life with a parasite that has to be stuffed with 
food and protected from weather 
and germs all the time. And the 
fool thing wears out anyway — 
no matter how much you stuff 
and protect it! 

"Who," he wanted to know, 
"really wants one of the things? 
What's so wonderful about protoplasm that we've got to carry 
so damned many pounds of it 
with us wherever we go? 

"Trouble with the world," said 
Konigswasser, "isn't too many 
people — it's too many bodies." 

When his teeth went bad on 
him, and he had to have them all 
out, and he couldn't get a set of 
dentures that were at all comfortable, he wrote in his diary, 
"If living matter was able to 
evolve enough to get out of the 
ocean, which was really quite a 



UNREADY TO WEAR 



101 



pleasant place to live, it certainly 
ought to be able to take another 
step and get out of bodies, which 
are pure nuisances when you stop 
to think about them." 

He wasn't a prude about 
bodies, understand, and he wasn't 
jealous of people who had better 
ones than he did. He just thought 
bodies were a lot more trouble 
than they were worth. 

He didn't have great hopes that 
people would really evolve out of 
their bodies in his time. He just 
wished they would. Thinking 
hard about it, he walked through 
a park in his shirtsleeves and 
stopped off at the zoo to watch 
the lions being fed. Then, when 
the rainstorm turned to sleet, he 
headed back home and was interested to see firemen on the 
edge of a lagoon, where they 
were using a pulmotor on a 
drowned man. 

Witnesses said the old man 
had walked right into the water 
and had kept going without 
changing his expression until he'd 
disappeared. Konigswasser got a 
look at the victim's face and said 
he'd never seen a better reason 
for suicide. He started for home 
again and was almost there before he realized that that was his 
own body lying back there. 

TTE went back fo reoccupy the 
body just as the firemen got 
it breathing again, and he walked 



it home, more as a favor to the 
city than anything else. He walked it into his front closet, got out 
of it again, and left it there. 

He took it out only when he 
wanted to do some writing or 
turn the pages of a book, or when i 
he had to feed it so it would have 
enough energy to do the few odd .: 
jobs he gave it. The rest of the >, 
time, it sat motionless in the 
closet, looking dazed and using ' 
almost no energy. Konigswasser 
told me the other day that he ■] 
used to run the thing for about ' 
a dollar a week, just taking it out 
when he really needed it. 

But the best part was that 
Konigswasser didn't have to sleep ■ 
any more, just because it had to 
sleep; or be afraid any more, just 
because it thought it might get ' 
hurt; or go looking for things it 
seemed to think it had to have. 
And, when it didn't feel well, > 
Konigswasser kept out of it until 
it felt better, and he didn't have \ 
to spend a fortune keeping the j 
thing comfortable. 

When he got his body out of 
the closet to write, he did a book 
on how to get out of one's own 
body, which was rejected without 
comment by twenty-three publishers. The twenty-fourth sold 
two million copies, and the book 
changed human life more than 
the invention of fire, numbers, the 
alphabet, agriculture, or the 
wheel. When somebody told Ko

nigswasser that, he snorted that 
they were damning his book with 
faint praise. I'd say he had a 
point there. 

By following the instructions 
in Konigswasser's book for about 
two years, almost anybody could 
get out of his body whenever he 
wanted to. The first step was to 
understand what a parasite and 
dictator the body was most of 
the time, then to separate what 
the body wanted or didn't want 
from what you yourself — your 
psyche — wanted or didn't want. 
Then, by concentrating on what 
you wanted, and ignoring as 
much as possible what the body 
wanted beyond plain maintenance, you made your psyche 
demand its rights and become 
self-sufficient. 

That's what Konigswasser had 
done without realizing it, until 
he and his body had parted company in the park, with his psyche 
going to watch the lions eat, and 
with his body wandering out of 
control into the lagoon. 

The \ final trick of separation, 
once your psyche grew independent enough, was to start your 
body walking into some direction 
and suddenly take your psyche 
off in j another direction. You 
couldn'^ do it standing still,, for 
some reason — you had to walk. 

At first, Madge's and my 
psyches were clumsy at getting 
along outside our bodies, like the 



first sea animals that got stranded on land millions of years ago, 
and who could just waddle and 
squirm and gasp in the mud. But 
we became better at it with time, 
because the psyche can naturally 
adapt so much faster than the 
body. 

T1/|"ADGE and I had good reason for wanting to get out. 
Everybody who was crazy 
enough to try to get out at the 
first had good reasons. Madge's 
body was sick and wasn't going 
to last a lot longer. With her 
going in a little while, I couldn't 
work up enthusiasm for sticking 
around much longer myself. So 
we studied Konigswasser's book 
and tried to get Madge out of her 
body before it died. I went along 
with her, to keep either one of us 
from getting lonely. And we just 
barely made it — six weeks before her body went all to pieces. 

That's why we get to march 
every year in the Pioneers' Day 
Parade. Not everybody does — only the first five thousand of 
us who turned amphibious. We 
were guinea pigs, without much 
to lose one way or another, and 
we were the ones who proved to 
the rest how pleasant and safe it 
was — a heck of a lot safer than 
taking chances in a body year 
in and year out. 

Sooner or later, almost everybody had a good reason for giving 



104 




 



it a try. There got to be millions 
and finally more than a billion 
of us — invisible, insubstantial, 
indestructible, and, by golly, 
true to ourselves, no trouble to 
anybody, and not afraid of anything. 

When we're not in bodies, the 
Amphibious Pioneers can meet 
on the head of a pin. When we 
get into bodies for the Pioneers' 
Day Parade, we take up over 
fifty thousand square feet, have 
to gobble more than three tons 
of food to get enough energy to 
march; and lots of us catch colds 
or worse, and get sore because 
somebody's body accidentally 
steps on the heel of somebody 
else's body, and get jealous because some bodies get to-lead and 
others have to stay in ranks, and 
— oh, hell, I don't know what all. 

I'm not crazy about the parade. 
With all of us there, close together in bodies — well, it brings 
out the worst in us, no matter 
how good our psyches are. Last 
year, for instance, Pioneers' Day 
was a scorcher. People couldn't 
help being out of sorts, stuck in 
sweltering, thirsty bodies for 
hours. 

Well, one thing led to another, 
and the Parade Marshal offered 
to beat the daylights out of my 
body with his body, if my body 
got out of step again. Naturally, 
being Parade Marshal, he had 
the best body that year, except 



for Konigswasser's cowboy, but I 
told him to soak his fat head, 
anyway. He swung, and I ditched 
my body right there, and didn't 
even stick around long enough 
to find out if he connected. He 
had to haul my body back to the 
storage center himself. 

I stopped being mad at him 
the minute I got out of the body. 
I understood, you see. Nobody 
but a saint could be really sympathetic or intelligent for more 
than a few minutes at a time in 
a body — or happy, either, except in short spurts. I haven't 
met an amphibian yet who wasn't 
easy to get along with, and cheerful and. interesting — as long as 
he was outside a body. And I 
haven't met one yet who didn't 
turn a little sour when he got 
into one. 

The minute you get in, chemistry takes over — glands making you excitable or ready to 
fight or hungry or mad or affectionate, or — well you never 
know what's going to happen 
next. 

rpHAT'S why I can't get sore 
at the enemy, the people who 
are against the amphibians. They 
never get out of their bodies and 
won't try to learn. They don't 
want anybody else to do it, either, ' 
and they'd like to make the amphibians get back into bodies and 
stay in them. 



UNREADY TO WEAR

After the tussle I had with the 
Parade Marshal, Madge got wind 
of it and left her body right in 
the middle of the Ladies' Auxiliary. And the two of us, feeling 
full of devilment after getting 
shed of the bodies and the parade, went over to have a look 
at the enemy. 

I'm never keen on going over 
to look at them. Madge likes to 
see what the women are wearing.. 
Stuck with their bodies all the 
time, the enemy women change 
their clothes and hair and cosmetic styles a lot oftener than 
we do on the women's bodies in 
the storage centers. 

I don't get much of a kick out 
of the fashions, and almost everything else you see and hear in 
enemy territory would bore a 
plaster statue into moving away. 

Usually, the enemy is talking 
about old-style reproduction, 
which is the clumsiest, most comical, most inconvenient thing anyone could imagine, compared 
with what the amphibians have 
in that line. If they aren't talking about that, then they're talking about food, the gobs of 
chemicals they have to stuff into 
their bodies. Or they'll talk about 
fear, which we. used to call politics — job politics, social politics, 
government politics. 

The enemy hates that, having 
us able to peek in on them any 
time we want to, while they can't 



ever see us unless we get into 
bodies. They seem to be scared 
to death of us, though being 
scared of amphibians makes as 
much sense as being scared of 
the sunrise. They could have the 
whole world, except the storage m 
centers, for all the amphibians 
care. But they bunch together as 
though we were going to come 
whooping out of the sky and do 
something terrible to them at any 
moment. 

They've got contraptions all 
over the place that are supposed 
to detect amphibians. The gadgets aren't worth a nickel, but 
they seem to make the enemy 
feel good — like they were lined 
up against great forces, but keep-' 
ing their nerve and doing important, clever things about it. 
Knowhow — all the time they're 
patting each other about how 
much knowhow they've got, and 
about how we haven't got anything by comparison. If knowhow 
means weapons, they're dead 
right. 

I guess there is a war on between them and us. But we 
never do anything about holding 
up our side of the war, except 
to keep our parade sites and our 
storage centers secret, and to get 
out of bodies every time there's 
an air raid, or the enemy fires a 
rocket, or something. 

That just makes the enemy 



106 




 



madder, because the raids and 
rockets and all cost plenty, and 
blowing up things nobody needs 
anyway is a poor return on the 
taxpayer's money. We always 
know what they're going to do 
next, and when and where, so 
there isn't any trick to keeping 
out of their way. 

But they are pretty smart, considering they've got bodies to 
look after besides doing their 
thinking, so I always try to be 
cautious when I go over to watch 
them. That's why I wanted to 
clear out when Madge and I saw 
a storage center in the middle of 
one of their fields. We hadn't 
talked to anybody lately about 
what the enemy was up to, and 
the center looked awfully suspicious. 

Madge was optimistic, the way 
she's been ever since she borrowed that burlesque queen's body, 
and she said the storage center 
was a sure sign that the enemy 
had seen the light, that they were 
getting ready to become amphibious themselves. 

Well, it looked like it. There 
was a brand-new center, stocked 
with bodies and open for business, 
as innocent as you please. We circled it several times, and Madge's 
circles got smaller and smaller, 
as she tried to get a close look 
at what they had in the way of 
ladies* ready-to-wear. 

"Let's beat it," I said. 



"I'm just looking," said Madge. 
"No harm in looking." 

Then she saw what was in the 
main display case, and she forgot 
where she was or where she'd 
come from. 

The most striking woman's 
body I'd ever seen was in the 
case — six feet tall and built like 
a goddess. But that wasn't the 
payoff. The body had coppercolored skin, chartreuse hair and 
fingernails, and a gold lame evening gown. Beside that body was 
the body of a blond, male giant 
in a pale blue field marshal's uniform, piped in scarlet, and spangled with medals. 

I think the enemy must have 
swiped the bodies in a raid on 
one of our outlying storage centers, and padded and dyed them, 
and dressed them up. 

"Madge, come back!" I said. 

The copper-colored woman 
with the chartreuse hair moved. 
A siren screamed and soldiers 
rushed from hiding places to grab 
the body Madge was in. 

The center was a trap for amphibians! 

The body Madge hadn't been 
able to resist had its ankles tied 
together, so Madge couldn't take 
the few steps she had to take if 
she was going to get out of it 
again. 

The soldiers carted her off triumphantly as a prisoner of war. 
I got into the only body avail

107 



able, the fancy field marshal, to 
try to help her. It was a hopeless 
situation, because the field marshal was bait, too, with its ankles 
tied. The soldiers dragged me after Madge. 

' | iHE cocky young major in 
charge of the soldiers did a 
jig along the shoulder of the road, 
he was so proud. He was the first 
man ever to capture an amphibian, which was really something 
from the enemy's point of view. 
They'd been at war with us for 
years, and spent God knows how 
many billions of dollars, but 
catching us was the first thing 
that made any amphibians pay 
much attention to them. 

When we got to the town, people were leaning out of windows 
and waving their flags, and cheering the soldiers, and hissing 
Madge and me. Here were all the 
people who didn't want to be 
amphibious, who thought it was 
terrible for anybody to be amphibious — people of all colors, 
shapes, sizes, and nationalities, 
joined together to fight the amphibians. 

It turned out that Madge and 
I were going to have a big trial. 
After being tied up every which 
way in jail all night, we were 
taken to a court room, where television cameras stared at us. 

Madge and I were worn to frazzles, because neither one of us 



had been cooped up in a body 
that long since I don't know 
when. Just when we needed to 
think more than we ever had, in 
jail before the trial, the bodies 
developed hunger pains and we 
couldn't get them comfortable on 
the cots, no matter how we tried; 
and, of course, the bodies just 
had to have their eight hours 
sleep. 

The charge against us was a 
capital offense on the books of 
the enemy — desertion. As far 
as the enemy was concerned, the 
amphibians had all turned yellow 
and run out on their bodies, just 
when their bodies were needed to 
do brave and important things 
for humanity. 

We didn't have a hope of being 
acquitted. The only reason there 
was a trial at all was that it gave 
them an opportunity to sound 
off about why they were so right 
and we were so wrong. The court 
room was jammed with their big 
brass, all looking angry and brave 
and noble. 

"Mr. Amphibian," said the 
prosecutor, "you are old enough, 
aren't you, to remember when all 
men had to face up to life in their 
bodies, and work and fight for 
what they believed in?" 

"I remember when the bodies 
were always getting into fights, 
and nobody seemed to know 
why, or how to stop it," I said 
politely. "The only thing every 


108 




 



body seemed to believe in was 
that they didn't like to fight." 

"What would you say of a soldier who ran away in the face of 
fire?" he wanted to know. 

"I'd say he was scared silly." 

"He was helping to lose the 
battle, wasn't he?" 

"Oh, sure." There wasn't any 
argument on that one. 

"Isn't that what the amphibians have done — run out on the 
human, race in the face of the 
battle of life?" 

"Most of us are still alive, if 
that's what you mean," I said. 

TT was true. We hadn't licked 
death, and weren't sure we 
wanted to, but we'd certainly 
lengthened life something amazing, compared to the span you 
could expect in a body. 

"You ran out on your responsibilities!" he said. 

"Like you'd run out of a burning building, sir," I patiently explained. 

"Leaving everyone else to 
struggle on alone!" 

"They can all get out the same 
door that we got out of. You can 
all get out any time you want to. 
All you do is figure out what you 
want and what your body wants, 
and concentrate on — " 

The judge banged his gavel until I thought he'd split it. Here 
they'd burned every copy of Konigswasser's book they tould 



find, and there I was giving a 
course in how to get out of a 
body over a whole television network. 

"If you amphibians had your 
way," said the prosecutor, "everybody would run out on his responsibilities, and let life and 
progress as we know them disappear completely." 

"Why, sure," I agreed. "That's 
the point." 

"Men would no longer work 
for what they believe in?" he 
challenged. 

"I had a friend back in the old 
days who drilled holes in little 
square thingamajigs for seventeen years in a factory, and he 
never did get a very clear idea 
of what they were for. Another 
one I knew grew raisins for a 
glassblowing company, and the 
raisins weren't for anybody to 
eat, and he never did find out 
why the company bought them. 
Things like that make me sick — 
now that I'm in a body, of course 
— and what I used to do for a 
living makes me even sicker." 

"Then you despise human beings and everything they do," he 
said. 

"I like them fine — better. than 
I ever did before. I just think it's 
a dirty shame what they have to 
do to take care of their bodies. 
You ought to get amphibious and 
see how happy people can be 
when they don't have to worry 



UNREADY TO WEAR 



109 



about where their body's next 
meal is coming from, or how to 
beep it from freezing in the wintertime, or what's going to happen to them when their body 
wears out." 

"And that, sir, means the end 
of ambition, the end of greatness!" 

"Oh, I don't know about that," 
I said. "We've got some pretty 
great people on our side. They'd 
be great in or out of bodies. It's 
the end of fear is what it is." I 
looked right into the lens of the 
•nearest television camera. "And 
that's the most wonderful thing 
that ever happened to people." 

Down came the judge's gavel 
again, and the brass started to 
shout me down. The television 
men turned off their cameras 
frantically, and all the spectators, 
except for the biggest brass, were 
cleared out. I knew I'd really 
said something. All anybody 
would be getting on his television 
set now was organ music. 

When the confusion died down, 
the judge said the trial was over, 
and that Madge and I were guilty of desertion. 

NOTHING I could do could 
get us in any worse, so I 
talked back. 

"Now I understand you poor 
fish," I said. "You couldn't get 
along without fear. That's the 
only skill you've got — how to 



scare yourselves and other people ' 
into doing things. That's the only j 
fun you've got, watching people *| 
jump for fear of what you'll do 
to their bodies or take away from 
their bodies." 1 

Madge got in her two cents'^ 
worth. "The only way you can 
get any response from anybody 
is to scare them." 

"Contempt of court!" said the 
judge. i 

"The only way you can scare 
people is if you can keep them 
in their bodies," I told him. 

The soldiers grabbed Madge * 
and me and started to drag us 
out of the court room. 

"This means war!" I yelled. I 

Everything stopped right there J 
and the place got very quiet. \ 

"We're already at war," said j 
a general uneasily. j 

"Well, we're not," I answered, \ 
"but we will be, if you don't un- ' 
tie Madge and me this instant." • 
I was fierce and impressive in j 
that field marshal's body. 

"You haven't any weapons," ) 
said the judge, "no knowhow. 
Outside of bodies, amphibians are 
nothing." 

"If you don't cut us loose by 
the time I count ten," I told him, ! 
"the amphibians will occupy the 
bodies of the whole kit and caboodle of you and march you 
right off the nearest cliff. The 
place is surrounded." That was j 
hogwash, of course. Only one per


110 




 



son can occupy a body at a time, 
but the enemy couldn't be sure 
of that. "One! Two! Three!" 

The general swallowed, turned 
white, and waved his hand vaguely. 

"Cut them loose," he said 
weakly. 

The soldiers, terrified, too, were 
glad to do it. Madge and I were 
freed. » 

I took a couple of steps, headed my spirit in another direction, 
and that beautiful field marshal, 
medals and all, went crashing 
down the staircase like a grandfather clock. 

I realized that Madge wasn't 
with me. She was still in that copper-colored body with the chartreuse hair and fingernails. 

"What's more," I heard her 
saying, "in payment for all the 
trouble you've caused us, this 
body is to be addressed to me 
at New York, delivered in good 
condition no later than next 
Monday." 

"Yes, ma'am," said the judge. 

WHEN we got home, the Pioneers' Day Parade was just 
breaking up at the local storage 
center, and the Parade Marshal 
got out of his body and apologized to me for acting the way he 
had. 

"Heck, Herb," I said, "you 
don't need to apologize. You 
weren't yourself. You were para


ding around in a body." 

That's the best part of being 
amphibious, next to not being 
afraid — people forgive you for 
whatever fool thing you might 
have done in a body. 

Oh, there are drawbacks, I 
guess, the way there are drawbacks to everything. We still 
have to work off and on, maintaining the storage centers and 
getting food to keep the community bodies going. But that's 
a small drawback, and all the big 
drawbacks I ever heard of aren't 
real ones, just old-fashioned 
thinking by people who can't stop 
worrying about things they used 
to worry about before they turned amphibious. 

As I say, the oldsters will 
probably never get really used 
to it. Every so often, I catch myself getting gloomy over what 
happened to the pay-toilet business it took me thirty years to 
build. 

But the youngsters don't have 
any hangovers like that from the 
past. They don't even worry 
much about something happening 
to the storage centers, the way 
us oldsters do. 

So I guess maybe that'll be 
the next step in evolution — to 
break clean like those first amphibians who crawled out of the 
mud into the sunshine, and who 
never did go back to the sea.

have value then, for they can be 
eaten, worn, bartered for other 
commodities. They remain real; 
money does not. 

This is not what we are experiencing today. You'll find personal 
difficulties in any time of prosperity, just as you'll find 
prosperous individuals in any depression, but it is the health of the 
economy as a whole that counts, 
not the fortune or misfortune of 
persons or groups. 

There is only a single conclusion to be drawn from the application of relativity to economics: 

Our system has, with marvelous resiliency, balanced prices 
and incomes to such an astonishingly great extent that whatever dangers face us, inflation is 
not one of them. 

NATURALLY, you can count 
on the creative mind to 
hunt for a story in any given 
situation. For example: 

We wistfully remember when 
steak was 37c a pound, custommade suits cost $50, the average 
house was priced under $5000, 
and our money was wooed by 
desperate offers of bargains. 

Those were days, yes, sir! The 
good old days — of low prices. 

We have considerably more 
trouble remembering just how 
scarce our money was. We now 
work shorter hours to earn a 



pound of steak, buy more suits, 
and never have so many of us 
owned homes. 

These, then, are the days — of 
high incomes. 

All some genius has to do is 
give us the incomes of today and 
the prices of the past. It can be 
done only in fiction, and even 
there it would be hard to work 
out logically. 

There's another psychological 
quirk in the situation. Mark 
Twain noted it in A Connecticut 
Yankee in King Arthur's Court. 

If people are offered their 
choice of 10c an hour and 10c a 
pound, or $1000 an hour and 
$1000 a pound, they'll almost invariably choose $1000 an hour 
and $1000 a pound — even though 
there is not the least actual difference. 

Why? I don't know. Maybe because it feels good to strip big 
bills off a thick roll while grumbling about what prices used to 
be. 

The editorial that started all 
this fuss began: "You might say 
that humanity's slogan is, 'The 
obvious we see eventually; the 
completely apparent takes longer." 

To that paraphrase of the 
Army Corps of Engineers' motto, 
I should have added: "When you 
contradict 'common sense,' keep 
your motor" running for a fast 
getaway." — H. L. GOLD

THE ROLLING STONES by 
Robert Heinlein. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York, 1952. 276 
pages, $2.50 

rpiMES must be getting pretty 
bad when the best science fiction of the month is a juvenile. 
However, The Rolling Stones 
might take leading place even if 
the competition was stiff. For 
this is one of Heinlein's most delightful tales for young (and old) 
about the coming era of space 
travel. 

It has wit (including some 
monstrous puns), richly lifelike 
people, believable plot (provided 



you grant the premises), some 
blistering commentary (as, for

DAVID STARR: SPACE RANGER by Paul French. Doubleday & Co., New York, 1952. 186 
pages, $2.50 

ri^HlS is another rip-snorting 
-■■ juvenile by a member of the 
profession who certainly knows 
what he is doing — Isaac Asimov, 
who is hiding behind that 
"French" falseface. 

This one is strictly for bloodand-thunder; "gripping" is the 
word, and (for my taste) a bit 
too violent from its first two sentences, "David Starr was staring 
right at the man, so he saw it 
happen. He saw him die," to its 
final episode where the hero puts 



the villain through a medieval 
course of torture by slow poison. 

However, violence aside, it is a 
thrilling tale. 

The plot : foods raised on Mars 
are essential to Earth's people, 
about 5,000 years from now. Villains are trying to get control of 
the Solar System's government by 
submitting Earth's populace to 
slow poison. David Starr, young 
Council of Science member, goes 
to Mars and after many adventures (including his discovery of 
the existence of real Martians in 
caves far below the planet's surface) pins down the rotters and 
frees Earth from threat of extinction. 

Not a girl in a carload; no romance; parlous little science; but 
endless imagination, exciting 
ideas and events. A good juvenile 
needn't offer more. This would be 
good even if it had less to offer. , 

PLANTS, MAN AND LIFE by

$4.00 

TTERE is an item that anyone 
who enjoys Willy Ley's natural history books will not want 
to miss. It is right down the science fiction lover's lane, telling 
an enthralling story of plant origins, plant variations and plant 
mysteries, with special emphasis 
on certain common weeds and

agricultural crop plants. 

Admittedly a little heavier than 
the popularizations of Ley, this 
book by the assistant director of 
the Missouri Botanical Garden 
and Professor of Botany at Washington University, St. Louis, is 
nevertheless an exciting adventure into a "new continent," the 
story of our ordinary plants. 

For once I can agree with a 
jacket blurb: "Probably not since 
the time of Darwin has there been 
a book more intelligible to the 
general reader, which was also of 
direct significance in the realm of 
science." 

THE STARMEN by Leigh 
B racket t. Gnome Press, New 
York, 1952. 213 pages, $2.75 

Tt/|"ISS BRACKETT'S first 
novel in hard covers is a 
pleasurable way of passing a couple of hours. She writes well, 
moves her plot along at a suitable pace, and maneuvers her 
characters in a lifelike manner. 

The story deals with an American, Michael Trehearne, who 
discovers that he is one of an 
alien world of mutants whose 
mutation is such that they are 
able to stand the physical effects 
of acceleration for interstellar 
flight. The discovery is strange 
indeed, and so is life on the hidden spaceship of the Vardda, as 
the mutants are called. 



Trehearne leaves Earth and be- ^ 
comes an accepted Varddan. 
There is a beautiful girl, Shairn; 
a villain, Kerrel; and a plot which 
involves the efforts of a certain 
group to give the secret of star 
flight to all people of the Universe, removing it from the status 
of a Varddan monopoly. Everything comes out right in the end, 
of course. 

DOG IN THE SKY by Norman 
Corwin. Illustrated by Tibor Gergely. Simon & Schuster, New 
York] 1952. 156 pages, $3.00 

TN THIS whimsy about the 
Galaxy, Runyon Jones, aged 
10, sets out to locate Curgatory, 
where his dog, Pootzy, went after 
being run over by an auto. It is 
imaginative, gently spoofs BEMS 
and other science fiction cliches, 
and it is occasionally rather sharp 
on the inequities of rules-andregulations, bureaucrats, and so 
on. 

Among the characters, pleasant 
and otherwise, whom you will 
meet are Mother Nature, B. L. Z. 
Bubb, Father Time, and the 
Giant. 

It's all rather cute, but (except 
once or twice) not sickeningly so. 
Fun for those who like Stuart 
Little by E. B. White, or The 
White Deer by James Thurber — 
though not approaching those two 
pluperfect gems.

PRISONER IN THE SKULL by 
Charles Dye. Abelard Press, New 
York, 1952. 256 pages, $2.50 

THERE are 21 chapters in this 
book. By the end of Chapter 
10, every important character except the hero, the mystery woman, the watchman and "Hypo 
Ned" have been bumped off. A 
few pages later, the watchman is 
found dead, half a dozen other 
supernumeraries have been permanently disposed of or conked 
on the bean. 

At the end, after roughly a 
dozen more completely uncalledfor murders of unimportant people, one finds that practically no 
one is left except the hero, who 
has bumped off Hypo Ned, and 
the mystery woman, who takes 
over the hero with the following 
ineffable phrases which close the 
book: "You need someone to 
watch you," she finally said . . . 
"To kill you, of course . . ." And 
the last three words: "Their lips 
met." 

There is no real story behind 
all this pointless mayhem, although there was a good idea. 
The purpose was to show a ruthless telepath — only one — trying 
to take over the world and run it 
as he wishes. If ruthless enough, 
such a telepath could certainly do 



it, and the story might have been 
fascinating. 

But here it is so buried in 
blood, bruises, cut lips, knockouts, "stungunned" roughs, tortures and murders that before 
long you realize it's an evasion 
instead of a plot. 

DROME by John Martin Leahy. 
Fantasy Publishing Co., Inc., Los 
Angeles, 1952. 295 pages, $3.00 

MEET one of those varicosed 
imitations of A. Merritt 
that proliferated during the 1920s 
and that always made Merritt, a 
pretty purple writer himself , seem 
restrained. 

Drome is one of the poorest of 
the imitations — weak in concept, 
in plot, in characterizations, in 
style of writing. There is literally no reason for its being hauled 
lifeless out of the obscurity of the 
magazine files. 

Briefly, Drome tells of one 
more underworld, this one entered through a crevasse in the 
upper reaches of Mount Rainier 
in the state of Washington. By 
page 212, one has still not reached Drome and boredom has set 
in. It is not relieved until page 
295, which is where the book 
ends.

The Sentimentalists 




RHADAMPSICUS andNodalictha were on their 
honeymoon, and consequently they were sentimental. 
To be sure, it would not have 
been easy for humans to imagine 
sentiment as existing between 
them. Humans would hardly associate tenderness with glances 
cast from sets of sixteen eyes 
mounted on jointed eye stalks,

nor link langorous thrills with a 
coy mingling of positronic rejafhlsion blasts — even when the emission of positron blasts from 
beneath one's mantle was one's 
normal personal mode of locomotion. And when two creatures 
like Rhadampsicus and Nodalic
tha stood on what might be 
it 

roughly described as their heads 
and twined their eye stalks to


gether, so that they gazed fondly 
at each other with all sixteen eyes 
at once, humans would not have 
thought of it as the equivalent of 
a loving kiss. Humans would 
have screamed and run — if they 
were not paralyzed by the mere 
sight of such individuals. 

Nevertheless, they were a very 
happy pair and they were very 
sentimental, and it was probably

a good thing, considered from all 
angles. They were still newlyweds 
on their wedding tour — they had 
been married only seventy-five 
years before — when they passed 
by the sun that humans call Cetis 
Gamma. 

Rhadampsicus noted its peculiarity. He was anxious, of course, 
for their honeymoon to be memorable in every possible way. So 
he pointed it out to Nodalictha 
and explained what was shortly 
to be expected. She listened with 
a bride's rapt admiration of her 
new husband's wisdom. Perceiving his scientific interest, she suggested shyly that they stop and 
watch. 

T» HADAMPSICUS scanned 
the area. There were planets 
— inner ones, and then a group of 
gas giants, and then a very cosy 
series of three outer planets with 
surface temperatures ranging 
from three to seven degrees Kelvin. 

They changed course and landed on the ninth planet out, where 
the landscape was delightful. 
Rhadampsicus unlimbered his 
traveling kit and prepared a 
bower. Nitrogen snow rose and 
swirled and consolidated as he 
deftly shifted force-pencils. When 
the tumult subsided, there was a 
snug if primitive cottage for the 
two of them to dwell in while 
they waited for Cetis Gamma to 



accomplish its purpose. 

Nodalictha cried out softly 
when she entered the bower. She 
was fascinated by its completeness. There was even running 
liquid hydrogen from a little rill 
nearby. And over the doorway, 
as an artistic and appropriate 
touch, Rhadampsicus had put 
his own and Nodalictha's initials, 
pricked out in amber chlorine 
crystals and intertwined within 
the symbol which to them meant 
a heart. Nodalictha embraced him 
fondly for his thoughtfulness. Of 
course, no human would have 
recognized it as an embrace, but 
that did not matter. 

Happily, then, they settled 
down to observe the phenomenon 
that Cetis Gamma would presently display. They scanned the gas 
giant planets together, and then 
the inner ones. 

On the second planet out from 
the sun, they perceived small biped animals busily engaged in 
works of primitive civilization. 
Nodalictha was charmed. She 
asked eager questions, and Rhadampsicus searched his memory 
and told her that the creatures 
were not well known, but had 
been observed before. Limited in 
every way by their physical constitution, they had actually 
achieved a form of space travel 
by means of crude vehicles. He 
believed, he said, that the name 
they called themselves was "men."

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



^ |^HE sun rose slowly in the 
east, and Lon Simpson swore 
patiently as he tried for the 
eighteenth time to get the generator back again in a fashion to 
make it work. His tractor waited 
in the nearby field. The fields 
waited. Over in Cetopolis, the 
scales and storesheds waited, and 
somewhere there was doubtless a 
cargo ship waiting for a spacegram to summon it to Cetis 
Gamma Two for a load of thanar 
leaves. And of course people 
everywhere waited for thanar 
leaves. 

A milligram a day kept old 
age away — which was not an advertising slogan but sound, practical geriatric science. But thanar 
leaves would only grow on Cetis 
Gamma Two, and the law said 
that all habitable planets had to 
be open for colonization and land 
could not be withheld from 
market. 

There was too much population back on Earth, anyhow. 
Therefore the Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company couldn't make 
a planetwide plantation and keep 
thanar as a monopoly, but could 
only run its own plantation for 
research and instruction purposes for new colonists. Colonists 
had to be admitted to the planet, 
and they had to be sold land. 
But there are' ways of getting 
around every law. 

Lon Simpson swore. The Diesel 



of his tractor ran a generator. 
The generator ran the motors in 
the tractor's catawheels. But this 
was the sixth time in a month 
that the generator had broken 
down, and generators do not 
break down. 

Lon put it together for the 
eighteenth time this breakdown, 
and it still wouldn't work. Therewas nothing detectably wrong 
with it, but he couldn't make it 
work. 

Seething, he walked back to his 
neat, prefabricated house. He 
picked up the beamphone. Even 
Cathy's voice at the exchange in 
Cetopolis could not soothe him, 
he was so furious. 

"Cathy, give me Carson — and 
don't listen!" he said tensely. 

He heard clickings on the twoway beam. 

"My generator's gone," he said 
sourly when Carson answered. 
"I've repaired it twice this week. 
It looks like it was built to stop 
working! What is this all about, 
anyhow?" 

The representative of the Cetis 
Gamma Trading Company 
sounded bored. 

"You want a new generator 
sent out?" he asked without interest.- "Your crop credit's still 
all right — if the fields are in good 
shape." 

"I want machinery that 
works!" Lon Simpson snapped. 
"I want machinery that doesn't 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



121 



have to be bought four times 
over a growing season! And I 
want it at a decent price!" 

"Look, those generators come 
out from Earth. There's freight 
on them. There's freight on everything that comes out from Earth. 
You people come to a developed 
planet, you buy your land, your 
•machinery, your house, and you 
get instruction in agriculture. Do 
you want the company to tuck 
you in bed at night besides? Do 
you want a new generator or 
not?" 

"How much?" demanded Lon. 
When Carson told him, he hit the 
ceiling. "It's robbery! What'll I 
have left for my crop if I buy 
that?" 

CARSON'S voice was still 
bored. "If you buy it and your 
crop's up to standard, you'll owe 
the crop plus three hundred credits. But we'll stake you to next 
growing season." 

"And if I don't?" demanded 
Lon. "Suppose I don't give you 
all my work for nothing and 
wind up in debt?" 

"By contract," Carson told him, 
"we've got the right to finish cultivating your crop and charge 
you for the work because we've 
advanced you credit on it. Then 
we attach your land, and house 
for the balance due. And you get 
no more credit at the Company 
stores. And passage off this planet 



has to be paid for in cash." He 
yawned. "Don't answer now," he 
said without interest. "Call me 
back after you calm down. You'd 
only haie to apologize." 

Lon Simpson heard the click 
as he began to describe, heatedly, 
what was in his mind.. He said 
it anyhow. Then Cathy's voice 
came from the exchange. She 
sounded shocked but sympathetic. , 

"Lon! Please!" 

He swallowed a particularly 
inventive description of the manners, morals and ancestry 'of all 
the directors and employees of 
the Cetis Gamma Trading Company. Then he said, still fuming, 
"I told you not to listen!" 

His wrongs overcame him 
again. "It's robbery! It's peonage! They've got every credit I 
had! They've got three-quarters 
of the value of my crop charged 
up for replacements of the lousy 
machinery they sold me*-and 
now I'll end the growing season 
in debt! How am I going to ask 
you to marry me?" 

"Not over a beamphone, I 
hope," said Cathy. 

He was abruptly sunk in gloom. 

"That was a slip," he admitted. 
"I was going to wait until I got 
paid for my crop. It looked 
good. Now — " 

"Wait a minute, Lon," Cathy 
said. There was silence. She gave 
somebody else a connection. 



122 




 



The phone-beams from the 
colony farms all went to Cetopolis and Cathy was one of the 
two operators there. If or when 
the colony got prosperous enough, 
there would be a regular intercommunication system. So it was 
said. Meanwhile, Lon had a suspicion that there might be another reason for the antiquated 
central station. 

Cathy said brightly, "Yes, 
Lon?" 

"I'll come in to town tonight," 
he said darkly. "Date?" 

"Y-yes," stammered Cathy. 
"Oh, yes!" 

He hung up and went back 
out to the field and the tractor. 
He began to think sourly of a 
large number of things all at once. There was a law to encourage people to leave Earth for 
colonies on suitable planets. 
There was even governmental 
help for people who didn't have 
funds of their own. But if a man 
wanted to make something of 
himself, he preferred to use his 
own money and pick his own 
planet and choose his own way of 
life. 

Lon Simpson had bought four 
hectares of land on Cetis Gamma 
Two. He'd paid his passage out. 
He'd given five hundred credits 
a month for an instruction course 
on the Company's plantation, 
during which time he'd labored 
faithfully to grow, harvest, and 



cure thanar leaves for the Company's profit. Then he'd bought 
farm machinery from the Company — and a house — and very 
painstakingly had set out to be 
a colonist on his own. 

JUST about that time, Cathy 
had arrived on a Company 
ship and taken up her duties as 
beamphone operator at Cetopolis. 
It was a new colony, with not 
more than five thousand humans 
on the whole planet, all of them 
concentrated near the one small 
town with its plank sidewalks 
and prefabricated buildings. Lon 
Simpson met Cathy, and his labors on his thanar farm acquired 
new energy and purpose. 

But he was up against a shrewd 
organization. His inordinately expensive farm machinery broke 
down. He repaired it. After a 
time it could not be repaired any 
longer and he had to buy more. 
Before the thanar plants were half 
grown, he owed more than half 
his prospective crop for machinery replacements. 

Now he could see the method 
perfectly. The Company imported 
all machinery. It made that machinery in its own factories, 
machinery that was designed to 
break down. So this year — even 
if nothing else happened — Lon 
would wind up owing more for 
machinery replacements than the 
crop would bring. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



123 



It was not likely that nothing 
else would happen. Next season 
he would start off in debt, instead 
of all clear, and if the same thing 
happened he would owe all his 
crop and be six thousand credits 
behind. By harvest after next, his 
farm and house could be foreclosed for debt and he could 
either try to work for other colonists — who were in the process of 
going through the same wringer 
themselves — or hire out as a 
farmhand on the Company's 
plantation. He would never be 
able to save space-fare away from 
the planet. He would be very 
much worse off than the assisted 
emigrants to other planets, who 
had not invested all they owned 
in land and machinery and agricultural instructions. 

And there was Cathy. She owed 
for her passage. It would be 
years before she could pay that 
back, if ever. She couldn't live 
in the farmhand barracks. They 
might as well give up thinking 
about each other. 

It was a system. Beautifully 
legal, absolutely airtight. Not a 
thing wrong with it. The Company had a monopoly on thanar, 
despite the law. It had all the 
cultivated land on Cetis Gamma 
Two under its control, and its 
labor problem was -solved. Its 
laborers first paid something like 
sixteen thousand credits a head 
for the privilege of trying to farm 



independently for a year or two, 
and then became farmhands for 
the Company at a bare subsistence wage. 

Lon Simpson was in the grip of 
that system. He had taken the 
generator apart and put it back 
together eighteen times. There 
was nothing visibly wrong with it. 
It had been designed to break 
down with nothing visibly wrong 
with it. I£ he couldn't repair it, 
though, he was out fifteen hundred credits, his investment was 
wiped out, and all his hopes w.ere 
gone. 

He took the generator apart for 
the nineteenth time. He wondered 
grimly how the Company's designers made generators so cleverly that they would stop working 
so that even the trouble with 
them couldn't be figured out. It 
was a very ingenious system. 

r\UT on the ninth planet, 
Rhadampsicus explained the 
situation to his bride as they 
waited for the interesting astronomical phenomenon. They were 
quite cosy, waiting. Their bower 
was simple, of course. Frozen 
nitrogen walls, and windows of 
the faint bluish tint of oxygen ice. 
Rhadampsicus had grown some 
cyanogen flower-crystals to make 
the place look homelike, and 
there was now a lovely reflectionpool in which liquid hydrogen 
reflected the stars. Cetis Gamma, 



124 




 



the local sun, seemed hardly more 
than a very bright and very near 
star — it was four light-hours 
away — and it glimmered over the 
landscape and made everything 
quite charming. 

Nodalictha, naturally, would 
not enter the minds of the male 
bipeds on the inner planet. Modesty forbade such a thing — as, of 
course, the conscientiousness of 
a brand-new husband limited 
Rhadampsicus to the thoughts of 
the males among the" bipeds. But 
Nodalictha was distressed when 
Rhadampsicus told her of what 
was occurring among the bipeds. 
He guided her thoughts to Cathy, 
in the beamphone exchange at 
Cetopolis. 

"But it is terrible!" said Nodalictha in distress when she had 
absorbed Cathy's maiden meditations. She did not actually 
speak in words and soundwaves. 
There is no air worth mentioning 
at seven degrees Kelvin. It's all 
frozen. A little helium hangs 
around, perhaps. Nothing else. 
The word for communication is 
not exactly the word for speech, 
but it will do. Nodalictha said, 
"They love each other! In a cute 
way, they are like — like we were, 
Rhadampsicus!". 

Rhadampsicus played a positron-beam on her in feigned indignation. If that beam had hit 
a human, the human would have 
curled up in a scorched, smoking 



heap. But Nodalictha bridled. 

"Rhadampsicus!" she protested fondly. "Stop tickling me ! But 
can't you do 4 something for them? 
They are so cute!" 

And Rhadampsicus gallantly 
sent his thoughts back to the 
second planet, where a biped 
grimly labored over a primitive 
device. 

T ON Simpson, staring at the 
-"- < disassembled generator, suddenly blinked. The grimness went 
out of his expression. He stared. 
An idea had occurred to him. He 
went over it in his mind. He blew 
out his breath in a long whistle. 
Then, very painstakingly, he did 
four or five things that completely ruined the generator for the 
extremely modest trade-in allowance he could have gotten for it 
at the Company store. 

He worked absorbedly for perhaps twenty minutes, his eyes intent. At the end of that time he 
had threads of unwound secondary wire stretched back and forth 
across a forked stick of dhil weed, 
and two small pieces of sheet iron 
twisted together in an extremely 
improbable manner. He connected the ends of the secondary wire 
to contacts in his tractor. He 
climbed into the tractor seat. He 
threw over the drive control. 

The tractor lurched into motion. The Diesel wasn't running. 
But the tractor rolled comfort


THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



125 



ably as Lon drove it, the individual motors in the separate 
catawheels drawing power from a 
mere maze of wires across a 
forked stick — plus two pieces of 
sheet iron. There was plenty of 
power. 

Lon drove the tractor the rest 
of the morning and all afternoon 
with a very peculiar expression 
on his face. He understood what 
he had done. Now that he had 
done it, it seemed the most 
obvious of expedients. He felt inclined to be incredulous that nobody had ever happened to think 
of this particulars-device before. 
But they very plainly hadn't. It 
was a source of all the electric 
power anybody could possibly 
want. The voltage would depend 
on the number of turns of copper 
wire around a suitably forked 
stick. The amperage would be 
whatever that voltage could put 
through whatever was hooked to 
it. 

He no longer needed a new 
generator for his tractor. He had 
one. 

He didn't even need a Diesel. 

With adequate power — he'd 
been having to nurse the Diesel 
along, too, lately — Lon Simpson 
ran his tractor late into the twilight. He cultivated all the ground 
that urgently needed. cultivation, 
and at least one field he hadn't 
hoped to get to before next week. 
But his expression was amazed. 



It is a very peculiar sensation to 
discover that one is a genius. 

*» 

THAT night, in Cetopolis, he 
told Cathy all about it. It . 
was a very warm night — an unusually warm night. They walked : 
along the plank sidewalks of the 
little frontier town — as a new 
colony, Cetis Gamma Two was a 
frontier — and Lon talked extravagantly. '' 

He had meant to explain painfully to Cathy that there was" no 
use in their being romantic about 
each other. He'd expected to have 
to tell - her bitterly that he was i 
doomed to spend the rest of his j 
life adding to the profits of the i 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company, j 
with all the laws of the human j 
race holding him in peonage. He'd 1 
thought of some very elegant de- H 
scriptions of the sort of people 
who'd worked out the system in 
force on Cetis Gamma Two. < 
But he didn't. As they strolled | 
under the shiver trees that lined > 
the small town's highways, and . « 
smelled the chanel bushes beyond S 
the town's limits, and listened to ; 
the thin violinlike strains of what i 
should have been night birds — 
they weren't; the singers were 
furry instead of feathered, and 
they slept in burrows during the 
day — as they walked with linked 
fingers in the warm and starlit 
night, Lon told Cathy about his 
invention. 



126 




 



He explained in detail just why 
wires wound in just that fashion, 
and combined with bits of sheet 
iron twisted in just those shapes, 
would produce power for free and 
forever. He explained how it had 
to be so. He marveled that nobody had ever thought of it before. He explained it so that 
Cathy could almost understand 
it. 

"It's wonderful!" she said wistfully. "They'll run spaceships on 
your invention, won't they, Lon? 
And cities? And everything! I 
guess you'll be very rich for inventing it!" 

He stopped short and stared at 
her. He hadn't thought that far 
ahead. Then he said blankly: 

"But I'll have to get back to 
Earth to patent it! And I haven't 
got the money to pay one fare, let 
alone two!" 

"Two?',' asked Cathy hopefully. "Why two?" 

"You're going to marry me, 
aren't you?" he demanded. "I 
sort of hope that was all settled." 

Cathy stamped her foot. 

"Hadn't you heard," she asked 
indignantly, "that such things 
aren't taken for granted? Especially when two people are walking in the starlight and are 
supposed to be thrilled? It isn't 
settled — not until after you've 
kissed me, anyhow!" 

He remedied his error. 



i"VUT on the ninth planet, very 
far away, Nodalictha blushed slightly. As a bride, she was 
in that deliciously embarrassing 
state of becoming accustomed to 
discussions which would previously have been unconventional. 

"They are so quaint!" Then she 
hesitated and said awkwardly, 
"The idea of putting their — their 
lips together as a sign of affection — " 

Rhadampsicus was amused, as 
a bridegroom may be by the de r 
lightful innocences of a new wife. 
He evinced his amusement in a 
manner no human being could 
conceivably have recognized as 
the tender laugh it was. 

"Little goose!" he said fondly. 
Of course, instead of a fowl, he 
thought of a creature that had 
thirty-four legs and scales instead 
of feathers and was otherwise 
thoroughly ungooselike. "Little 
goose, they do that because they 
can't do this!" 

And he twined his eye stalks 
sentfmentally about hers. 

T"|AYS passed on Cetis Gamma 
Two. Lon Simpson cultivated his thanar fields. But he began to worry. His new power 
source was more than a repair 
for a broken-down tractor. It was 
valuable. It was riches! He had 
in it one of those basic, overwhelmingly important discoveries 
by which human beings have 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



127 



climbed up from the status of intelligent Earthbound creatures to 
galactic colonists — And a lot of 
good it had done them! 

It was a basic principle for 
power supply that would relieve 
mankind permanently of the burden of fuels. The number of planets available for colonization 
would be multiplied. The cost of 
every object made by human beings would be reduced by the 
previous cost of power. The price 
of haulage from one planet to 
another would be reduced to a 
fraction. Every member of the 
human race would become richer 
as a result of the gadget now attached to Lon Simpson's tractor. 
He was entitled to royalties on 
the wealth he was to distribute. 
But ... 

He was a thanar farmer on 
Cetis Gamma Two. His crop was 
mortgaged. He could not possibly 
hope to raise enough money to 
get back to Earth to arrange for 
the marketing of his invention. 
Especially, he could not conceivably raise money enough to take 
Cathy with him. He had riches, 
but they weren't available. And 
something else might happen to 
ruin him at any time. 

Something else did. The freezer 
element of his deep-freeze locker 
broke down. He didn't notice it. 
He had a small kitchen locker in 
which food for week-to-week use 
was stored. He didn't know any


thing about the deep-freeze unit 
that held a whole growing season's supply of food. The food in 
it — all imported from Earth and 
very expensive — thawed, fermented, spoiled, developed evil smelling gases, and waited for an 
'appropriate moment to reveal itself as a catastrophe. 

There were other things to worry about at the time. A glacier up 
at Cetis Gamma Two's polar region began to retreat, instead of 
growing as was normal for the 
season. There was a remarkable 
solar prominence of three days' 
duration swinging around the 
equator of the local sun. There 
was a meeting of directors of the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company, 
at which one of the directors 
pointed out that the normal curve 
of increase" for profits was beginning to flatten out, and something 
had to be done to improve the 
financial position of the company. Ugly sun-spots appeared 
on the northern hemisphere of 
Cetis Gamma. If there had been 
any astronomers on the job, there 
would have been as much excitement as a four alarm fire. But 
there were no astronomers. 

The greatest agitation on the 
second planet of Cetis Gamma 
Two was felt by Lon Simpson. 
Cathy had made friends with a 
married woman colonist who 
would chaperon her on a visit to 
Lon's farm, and was coming 



128 




 



out to visit and see the place that 
was to be the scene of the ineffable, unparalleled happiness she 
and Lon would know after they 
were married. 

She came, she saw, she was 
captivated. Lon blissfully opened 
the door of the house she was to 
share. He had spent the better 
part of two days cleaning up so 
it would be fit for her to look at. 
Cathy entered. There was a dull, 
booming noise, a hissing, and a. 
bubbling, and then a rank stench 
swept through the house and 
strangled them. 

'■THE boom, of course, was the 
-■- bursting open of the deepfreeze locker from the pressure 
of accumulated gases within it. 
The smell was that of the deepfreeze contents, ten days thawed 
out without Lon knowing it. 
There are very few smells much 
worse than frozen fish gone very, 
very bad in a hot climate. If there 
are worse smells, they come from 
once-frozen eggs bursting from 
their shells when pressure outside 
them is relieved. In this case, 
trimmings were added by fermenting strawberries, moldy meat 
and badly decayed vegetables, 
all triumphantly making themselves known at the same instant. 

Cathy gasped and choked. Lon 
got her out of doors, gasping himself. It was not difficult to deduce 
what had happened. 



He opened the house windows 
from the outside, so the smell 
could go away. But he knew despair. 

"I— can't show you the house, 
Cathy," he said numbly. "My 
locker went bad and all the food 
followed suit." 

"Lon!" wailed Cathy. "It's terrible! How will you eat?" 

Lon began to realize that the 
matter was more serious than the 
loss of an opportunity for a sentimental inspection of the house. 
He had dreamed splendidly, of 
late. He didn't quite know how 
he was going to manage it, but 
since his tractor was working 
magnificently he had come to 
picture himself and Cathy in the 
role of successful colonists, zestfully growing thanar leaves for 
the increasing multitudes of people who needed a milligram a 
day. 

He'd reverted to the pictured 
dreams in the Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company's advertisements. He'd daydreamed of himself and Cathy as growing with 
the colony, thriving as it throve, 
and ultimately becoming moderately rich — in children and grandchildren, anyhow — with life 
stretching out before them in a 
sort of rosy glow. He'd negligently assumed that somehow they 
would also be rich from the royalties on his invention. But now 
he came down to reality. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



129 



His house was uninhabitable 
for the time being. He could continue to cultivate his fields, but 
he wouldn't be able to eat. The 
local plant-life was not suitable 
for human digestion. He had to 
live on food imported from 
Earth. Now he had to buy a new 
stock from the Company, and it 
would bankrupt him. 

With an invention worth more 
— probably — than the Cetis Gamma Company itself, if he could 
realize on it, he still was broke. 
His crop was mortaged. If Carson learned about his substitute 
for a generator, the Company 
would immediately clamp down 
to get it away from him. 

He took Cathy back to Cetopolis. He feverishly appealed to 
other colonists. He couldn't tell 
them about his generator substitute. If they knew about it, in 
time Carson would know. If they 
used it, Carson would eventually 
get hold of a specimen, to send 
back to Earth for pirating by the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company. 
All Lon could do was try desperately to arrange to borrow 
food to live on until his crop 
came in, though even then he 
wouldn't be in any admirable 
situation. 

He couldn't borrow food in 
quantity. Other colonists had 
troubles, too. They'd give him a 
meal, yes, but they couldn't refill 
his freezer without emptying 



their own. Which would compel 
them to buy more. Which would 
be charged against their crops. 
Which would simply hasten the 
day when they * would become 
day-laborers on the Company's 
thanar farm. 

Lon had about two days' food 
in the kitchen locker. He determined to stretch it to four. Then 
he'd have to buy more. With each 
meal, then, his hopes of freedom 
and prosperity — and Cathy — 
grew less. 

Of course, he could starve . . . 

RHADAMPSICUS was enormously and pleasantly interested in what went on in Cetis 
Gamma's photosphere. From the 
ninth planet, he scanned the 
prominences with enthusiasm, 
making notes. Nodalictha tried to 
take a proper wifely interest in 
her husband's hobby, but she 
could not keep it up indefinitely. 
She busied herself with her 
housekeeping. She fashioned a 
carpet of tufted methane fibres 
and put up curtains at the windows. She enlarged the garden 
Rhadampsicus had* made, adding 
borders of crystallized ammonia 
and a sort of walkway with a 
hedge of monoclinic sulphur 
which glittered beautifully in the 
starlight. She knew that this was 
only a temporary dwelling, but 
she wanted Rhadampsicus to realize that she, could make any 



130 




 



place a comfortable home. 

He remained absorbed in the 
phenomena of the local sun. One 
great prominence, after five days 
of spectacular existence, divided 
into two which naturally moved 
apart and stationed themselves 
at opposite sides of the sun's 
equator. They continued to rotate with the sun itself, giving 
very much the effect of an incipient pin wheel. Two other minor 
prominences came into being 
midway between them. Rhadampsicus watched in fascination. 

Nodalictha came and reposed 
beside him on a gentle slope of 
volcanic slag. She waited for him 
to notice her. She would not let 
herself be sensitive about his interest in his hobby, of course, 
but she could not really find it 
absorbing for herself. A trifle 
wistfully, she sent her thoughts 
to the female biped on the second 
planet. 

After a while she said in distress, "Rhadampsicus! Oh, they 
are so unhappy!" 

Rhadampsicus gallantly turned his attention from the happenings on the sun. 

"What's that, darling?" 

"Look!" said Nodalictha plaintively. "They are so much in 
love, Rhadampsicus! "And they 
can't marry because he hasn't 
anything edible to share with 
her!" 



Rhadampsicus scanned. He 
was an ardent and sentimental 
husband. If his new little wife 
was distressed about anything at 
all, Rhadampsicus was splendidly ready to do something 
about it. 

T ON SIMPSON looked at his 
kitchen locker. The big deepfreezer was repaired now. Once 
a season, a truck came out from 
Cetopolis and filled it. The food 
was costly. A season's supply was 
kept in deep-freeze. Once in one 
or two weeks, one refilled the 
kitchen locker. It was best to 
leave the deep-freeze locker 
closed as much as possible. But 
now the big deep-freeze was_ 
empty. He'd cleaned out the 
ghastly mess in it, and he had it 
running again, but he had nothing to put in it. To have it refilled would put him hopelessly 
at the Company's mercy, but 
there was nothing else to do. 

Bitterly, he called the Trading 
Company office, and Carson answered. 

"This is Simpson," Lon told 
him. "How much — " 

"The price for a generator," 
said Carson, bored, "is the same 
as before. Do you want it sent 
out?" — 

"No! My food locker broke 
down. My food store spoiled. I 
need more." 

"I'll figure it," replied Carson 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



131 



over the beamphone. He didn't 
seem interested. After a moment, 
he said indifferently, "Fifteen 
hundred credits for standard rations to crop time. ^Fhen you'll 
need more." 

"It's robbery!" raged Lon. "I 
can't expect more than four thousand credits for my crop! You've 
got three thousand charged 
against me now!" 

Carson yawned. "True. A new 
generator, fifteen hundred; new 
food supplies fifteen hundred. If 
your crop turns out all right, 
you'll start the new season with 
two thousand credits charged up 
as a loan against your land." 

Lon Simpson strangled on his 
fury. "You'll take all my leaves 
and I'll still owe you! Then credit 
for seed and food and — If I need 
to buy more machinery, you'll 
own my farm and crop next crop 
time! Even if my crop is good! 
Your damned Company will own 
my farm!" 

"That's your lookout," Carson 
said without emotion. "Being a 
thanar farmer was your idea, not 
mine. Shall I send out the food?" 

Lon Simpson bellowed into the 
beamphone. He heard clicking, 
then Cathy's voice. It was at on«e 
reproachful and sympathetic. 

"Lon! Please!" 

"OUT Lon couldn't talk to her. 

He panted at her, and hung 
up. It is essential to a young man 



in love that he shine, somehow, in 
the eyes of the girl he cares for. 
Lon was not shining. He was appearing as the Galaxy's prize sap. 
He'd invested a sizable fortune 
in his farm. He was a good farmer — hard-working and skilled. In 
the matter of repairing generators, he'd proved to be a genius. 
But he was at the mercy of the 
Cetis Gamma Company's representative. He was already in debt. 
If he wanted to go on eating, he'd 
go deeper. If he were careful and 
industrious and thrifty, the Trading Company would take his crop 
and farm in six more months and 
then give him a job at day-labor 
wages. 

He went grimly to the kitchen 
of his home. He looked at the 
trivial amount of food remaining. 
He was hungry. He could eat it 
all right now. 

If he did— 

Then, staring at the food in 
the kitchen locker, he blinked. An 
idea had occurred to him. He was 
blankly astonished at it. He went 
over and over it in his mind. His 
expression became dubiously 
skeptical, and then skeptically 
amazed. But his eyes remained 
intent as he thought. 

Presently, looking very skeptical indeed, he went out of the 
house and \mwound more copper 
wire from the remnant of the disassembled generator. He came 
back to the kitchen. He took an 



132 




 



emptied tin can and cut it in a 
distinctly peculiar manner. The 
cuts he made were asymmetrical. 
When he had finished, he looked 
at it doubtfully. 

A long time later he had made 
a new gadget. It consisted of two 
open coils, one quite large and 
one quite small. Their resemblance to each other was plain, 
but they did not' at all resemble 
any other coils that had been 
made for any other purpose whatsoever. If they looked like anything, it was the "mobiles" that 
some sculptors once insisted were 
art. 

Lon stared at his work with an 
air of helplessness. Then he went 
out again. He returned with the 
forked stick that had proved to 
be a generator. He connected the 
wires from that improbable contrivance to the coils of the new 
and still more unlikely device. 
The eccentrically cut tin can 
was in the middle, between them. 

There was a humming sound. 
Lon went out a third time and 
came back with a mass of shrubbery. He packed it in the large 
coil. 

He muttered to himself, "I'm 
out of my head! I'm crazy!" 

But then he went to the kitchen locker. He put a small packet of frozen green peas in the tin 
can between the two coils. 

The humming sound increased. 
After a moment there was an


other parcel of green peas — not 
frozen — in the small coil. 

Lon took it out. The device 
hummed more loudly again. Immediately there was another parcel of green peas in the small 
coil. He took them out. 

When he had six parcels of 
green peas instead of one, the 
mass of foliage in the large coil 
collapsed abruptly. Lon disconnected the wires and removed the 
debris. The native foliage looked 
shrunken, somehow, dried-out. 
Lon tossed it through the window. 

TJE put a parcel of unfrozen 
green peas on to cook and 
sat down and held his head in his 
hands. He knew what had happened. He knew how. 

The local flora on Cetis Gamma Two naturally contained the 
same chemical elements as the 
green peas imported from Earth. 
Those elements were combined in 
chemical 'compounds similar, if 
not identical to, those of the 
Earth vegetation. The new gadget simply converted the compounds in the large coil to match 
those in the sample — in the tin 
can — and assembled them in the 
small coil according to the physical structure of the sample. In 
this case, as green peas. 

The device would take any approximate compound from the 
large coil and reassemble it — 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



133 



suitably modified as per sample 
— in the small coil. It would work 
not only for green peas, but for 
roots, barks, herbs, berries, blossoms and flowers. 

It would even work for thanar 
leaves. 

When that last fact occurred to 
him, Lon Simpson went quietly 
loony, trying to figure out how he 
had come to think of such a thing. 
He was definitely crocked, because he picked up the beamphone and told Cathy all about 
it. And he was not loony because 
he told Cathy, but because he 
forgot his earlier suspicions of 
why there was a central station 
for beamphones in Cetopolis, instead of a modern direct-communication system. 

In fact, he forgot the system in 
operation on Cetis Gamma Two 
— the Company's system. It had 
been designed to put colonists 
through the wringer and deposit 
them at its own farm to be daylaborers forever with due regard 
to human law. But it was a very 
efficient system. 

It took care of strokes of genius, too. 

That night, Carson, listening 
boredly to the record of all the 
conversations over the beamphone during the day, heard what 
Lon had told Cathy. He didn't 
believe it, of course. 

But he made a memo to look 
into it. 




RHADAMPSICUS stretched 
himself. Out on the ninth 
planet, the weather was slightly 
warmer — almost six degrees Kelvin, two hundred and sixty-odd 
degrees centigrade below zero — 
and he was inclined to be lazy. 
But he was very handsome, in 
Nodalictha's- eyes. He was seven


134 




 



ty or more feet from his foremost 
eye stalk to the tip of his least 
crimson appendage, and he fluoresced beautifully in the starlight. 
He was a very gallant young 
bridegroom. 

When he saw Nodalictha looking at him admiringly, he said 
with his customary tenderness: 



"It was fatiguing to make him 
go through it, darling, but since 
you wished it, it is done. He now 
has food to share with the female." 

"And you're handsome, too, 
Rhadampsicus !" Nodalictha said 
irrelevantly. 

She felt as brides sometimes do 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



135 



on their honeymoons. She was 
quite sure that she had not only 
the bravest and handsomest of 
husbands, but the most thoughtful and considerate. 

Presently, with their eye stalks 
intertwined, he asked softly: 

"Are you weary of this place, 
darling? I would like to watch 
the rest of this rather rare phenomenon, but if you're not interested, we can go on. And truly 
I won't mind." 

"Of course we'll stay!" protested Nodalictha. "I want to do 
anything you want to. I'm perfectly happy just being with 
you." 

And, unquestionably, she was. 

|^ARSON, though bored, was a 
^* bit upset by the recorded conversation he'd listened to. Lon 
Simpson had been almost incoherent, but he obviously meant 
Cathy to take him seriously. And 
there were some things to back 
it up. 

He'd reported his generator 
hopelessly useless — and hadn't 
bought a new one. He'd reported 
all his food spoiled — and hadn't 
bought more. Carson thought it 
over carefully. The crop inspection helicopter reported Simpson's fields in much better shape 
than average, so his tractor was 
obviously working. 

Carson asked casual, deadpan 
questions of other colonists who 



came into the Company store. 
Most of them were liarried, sullen 
and bitter. They were unanimously aware of the wringer they 
were being put through. They 
knew what the Company was 
doing to them and they hated 
Carson because he represented it. 
But they did answer Carson's 
casual questions about Lon 
Simpson. 

Yes, he'd tried to borrow food 
from them. No, they couldn't 
lend it to him. Yes, he was still 
eating. In fact he was offering to 
swap food. He was short on fruit 
and long on frozen green peas. 
Then he was long on fruit and 
frozen green peas and short on 
frozen sweet corn and strawberries. No, he didn't want to trade 
on a big scale. One package of 
frozen strawberries was all he 
wanted. He gave six packages of 
frozen peas for it. He gave six 
packages of frozen strawberries 
for one package of frozen sweet 
corn. He'd swapped a dozen parcels of sweet corn for one of fillet 
of flounder, two dozen fillet of 
flounder for cigarettes, and fifty 
cartons of cigarettes for a frozen 
roast of beef. 

It didn't make sense unless the 
conversation on the beamphone 
was right. If what Lon had told 
Cathy was true, he'd have his 
frozen food locker filled up again 
by now. He had some sort of device which converted the indi


136 




 



gestible local flora and fauna into 
digestible Earth products. To 
suspect such a thing was preposterous, but Carson suspected everyone and everything. 

As representative of the Company, Carson naturally did its 
dirty work. New colonists bought 
farms from the central office on 
Earth and happily took ship to 
Cetis Gamma Two. Then Carson 
put them through their instruction course, outfitted them to try 
farming on their own, and saw 
to it that they went bankrupt 
and either starved or took jobs 
as farmhands for the Company, 
at wages assuring that they could 
never take ship away again. 

It was a nasty job and Carson 
did it very well, because he loved it. 

While he still debated Lon's 
insane boasts to Cathy over the 
beamphone system, he prepared 
to take over the farm of another 
colonist. That man had been 
deeper in debt than Lon, and he'd 
been less skilled at repairs, so it 
was time to gather him in. Carson called him to Cetopolis to 
tell him that the Company regretfully could not extend further 
credit, would have to take back 
his farm, house, and remaining 
food stores, and finish the cultivation of his thanar leaf crop to repay itself for the trouble. 

The colonist, however, said 
briefly: "Go to hell." 



TTE started to leave Carson's 
air-cooled office. Carson said 
mildly : 

"You're broke. You'll want a 
job when you haven't got a farm. 
You can't afford to tell me to go 
to hell." 

"You can't take my farm unless my fields are neglected," the 
colonist said comfortably. "They 
aren't. And my thanar leaf crop is 
going to be a bumper one. I'll 
pay off all I owe — and we colonists are planning to start a trading company of our own, to bring 
in good machinery and deal 
fairly." 

Carson smiled coldly, 

"You forget something," he 
said. "As representative of the 
Trading Company, I can call on 
you to pay up all your debts at 
once, if I have reason to think 
you intend to try to evade payment. I do think so. I call on 
you for immediate payment in 
full. Pay up, please!" 

This was an especially neat 
paragraph in the fine print of the 
colonists' contract with the Company. Any time a colonist got 
obstinate he could be required to 
pay all he owed, on the dot. And 
if he had enough to pay, he 
wouldn't owe. So the Trading 
Company could ruin anybody. 

But this colonist merely grinned. 

"By law," he observed, "you 
have to accept thanar leaves as 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



137 



legal tender, at five credits a 
kilo. Send out a truck for your 
payment. I've got six tons in my 
barn, all ready to turn in." 

He made a most indecorous 
gesture and walked out. A moment later, he put his head back 
in. 

"I forgot," he commented politely. "You said I couldn't afford 
to tell you to go to hell. With six 
tons of thanar leaves on hand, 
I'm telling you to — " 

He added several other things, 
compared to which telling Carson to go to hell was the height of 
courtesy. He went away. 

Carson went a little pale. It 
occurred to him that this colonist was a close neighbor of Lon 
Simpson. Maybe Lon had gotten 
tired of converting dhil weed and 
shiver leaves into green peas and 
asparagus, and had gotten to 
work turning out thanar. 

CARSON went to Lon's farm. 
It was a very bad road, and 
any four-wheeled vehicle would 
have shaken itself to pieces on 
the way. The gyrocar merely jolted Carson severely. The jolting 
kept him from noticing how hot 
the weather was. It was really 
extraordinarily hot, and Carson 
suffered more because he spent 
most of his time in an air-conditioned office. But for the same 
reason he did not suspect anything abnormal. 



When he reached Lon's farm, 
he noticed that the thanar leaves 
were growing admirably. For a 
moment, sweating as he was, he 
was reminded of tobacco plants 
growing on Maryland hillsides. 
The heat and the bluish-green 
color of the plants seemed very 
familiar. But then a cateagle ran 
hastily up a tree, out on a branch, 
and launched its crimson furry 
self into midair. That broke the 
spell of supposedly familiar 
things. 

Carson turned his gyrocar in 
at Lon Simpson's house. There 
were half a dozen other colonists 
around. Two of them drove up 
with farm trucks loaded with 
mixed foliage. They had pulled 
up, cut off and dragged down 
just about anything that grew, 
and loaded their truck with it. 
Two other colonists were loading 
another cart with thanar leaves, 
neatly bundled and ready for the 
warehouse. 

They regarded Carson with 
pleased eyes. Carson spoke severely to Cathy. 

"What are you doing here? 
You're supposed to be on duty 
at the beamphone exchange! You 
can be discharged — " 

Lon Simpson said negligently, 
"I'm paying her passage. By law, 
anybody can pay the passage of 
any woman if she intends to 
marry him, and then her contract with the company is ended. 



138 




 



They had rules like that in ancient days — only they used to pay 
in tobacco instead of thanar 
leaves." 

Carson gulped. "But how will 
you pay her fare?" He asked 
sternly. "You're in debt to the 
Company yourself." 

Lon Simpson jerked his thumb 
toward his barn. Carson turned 
and looked. It was a nice-looking 
barn. The aluminum siding set 
it off against a backing of shiver 
trees, dhil and giant sketit 
growth. Carson's eyes bugged out. 
Lon's barn was packed so tightly 
with thanar leaves that they 
bulged out the doors. 

"I need to turn some of that 
stuff in, anyhow," said Lon 
pleasantly. "I haven't got storage space for it. By law you have 
to buy it at five credits a kilo. 
I wish you'd send out and get 
some. I'd like to build up some 
credit. Think I'll take a trip back 
to Earth." 

At this moment, there was a 
very peculiar wave of heat. It was 
riot violent, but the temperature 
went up about four degrees — suddenly, as if somebody had turned 
on a room heater. 

But still nobody looked up at 
the sun. 

T> ATTLED, Carson demanded 
furiously if Lon had converted other local foliage into thanar 
leaves, as he'd made his green 



peas and the other stuff he'd told 
Cathy about on the beamphone. 
Lon tensed, and observed to the 
other colonists that evidently all 
beamphones played into recorders. The atmosphere became unfriendly. Carson got more rattled 
still. He began to wave his arms 
and sputter. 

Lon Simpson treated him gently. He took him into the house to 
watch the converter at work. One 
of the colonists kept its large 
coil suitably stuffed with assorted 
foliage. There was a "hand" of 
cured, early — best quality — thanar leaves in an erratically cut tin 
can. Duplicates of that hand of 
best quality thanar were appearing in the small coil as fast as 
they were removed, and fresh 
foliage was being heaped into the 
large coil. 

"We expect," said Lon happily, 
"to have a bumper crop of the 
best grade of thanar this year. It 
looks like every colonist on the 
planet will be able to pay off his 
debt to the Company and have 
credit left over. We'll be sending 
a committee back to Earth to 
collect our credits there and organize an independent cooperative trading company that will 
bring out decent machinery and 
be a competitive buying agency 
for thanar. I'm sure the Company will be glad to see us all so 
prosperous." 

It was stifling hot by now, but 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



139 



nobody noticed. The colonists 
were much too interested in seeing Carson go visibly to pieces 
before them. He was one of those 
people who seem to have been 
developed by an all-wise Providence expressly to be underlings 
for certain types of large corporations. Their single purpose in life 
is to impress their superiors in 
the corporation that hires them. 
But now Carson saw his usefulness ended. Through his failure, 
in some fashion, the Company's 
monopoly on thanar leaves and 
its beautiful system of recruiting 
labor were ruined. He would be 
discharged and probably blacklisted. 

If he had looked up toward the 
western sky, squinted a little, and 
gazed directly at the local sun, 
he would have seen that his private troubles were of no importance at all. But he didn't. He 
went staggering to his gyrocar 
and headed back for Cetopolis. 

It was a tiny town, with plank 
streets, a beamphone exchange, 
and its warehouses over by the 
spaceport. It was merely a crude 
and rather ugly little settlement 
on a newly colonized planet. But 
it had been the center of an admirable system by which the 
Cetis Gamma Trading Company 
got magnificently rich and dispensed thanar leaf (a milligram 
a day kept old age away) 
throughout all humanity at the 



very top price the traffic would 
bear. And the system was shaky 
now and Carson would be blamed 
for it. 

Behind him, the colonists rejoiced as hugely as Carson suffered. But none of them got the 
proper perspective, because none 
of them looked at the sun. 

About four o'clock in the afternoon, it got suddenly hotter 
again, as abruptly as before. It 
stayed hotter. Something made 
Cathy look up. There was a thin 
cloud overhead, just the right 
thickness to act something like 
a piece of smoked glass. She 
could look directly at the sun 
through it, examine the disk with 
her naked eye. 

But it wasn't a disk any longer. 
Cetis Gamma was a bulging, irregularly shaped thing twice its 
normal size. As she looked, it 
grew larger still. 

OUT on the ninth planet, Rhadampsicus was absorbed in 
his contemplation of Cetis Gamma. With nothing to interfere 
with his scanning, he could follow the developments perfectly. 
There had been first one gigantic 
prominence, then two, which separated to opposite sides of its 
equator. Then two other prominences began to grow between 
them. 

For two full days, the new 
prominences grew, and then split, 



140 




 



so that the sun came to have the 
appearance of a ball of fire surrounded by a ring of blue-white 
incandescence. 

Then came instability. Flame 
geysers spouting hundreds of 
thousands of miles into emptiness 
ceased to keep their formation. 
They turned north and south 
from the equatorial line. The outline of the sun became irregular. 
It ceased to be round in profile, 
and even the appearance of a 
ring around it vanished. It looked — though this would never 
have occurred to Rhadampsicus 
— very much like a fiercely glowing gigantic potato. Its evolution 
of heat went up incredibly. It 
much more than doubled its rate 
of radiation. 

Rhadampsicus watched each 
detail of the flare-up with fascinated attention. Nodalictha dutifully watched with him. But she 
could not maintain her interest 
in so purely scientific a phenomenon. 

When a thin streamer of pure 
blue-white jetted upward from 
the sun's pole, attaining a speed 
of six hundred and ninety-two 
miles per second, Rhadampsicus 
turned to her with enthusiasm. 

"Exactly in the pattern of a 
flare-up according to Dhokis' 
theory!" he exclaimed. "I have 
always thought he was more nearly right thah the modernists. 
Radiation pressure can build up 



in a closed system such as the 
interior of a sun. It can equal the 
gravitational constant. And obviously it would break loose at 
the pole." 

Then he saw that Nodalictha's 
manner was one of distress. He 
was instantly concerned. 

"What's the matter, darling?" 
he asked anxiously. "I didn't 
mean to neglect you, my precious 
one!" 

Nodalictha did something that 
would have scared a human being 
out of a year's growth, but was 
actually the equivalent of an 
unhappy, stifled sob. 

"I am a beast!" said Rhadampsicus penitently. "I've kept you 
here, in boredom, while I enjoyed 
myself watching this sun do 
tricks. I'm truly sorry, Nodalictha. We will go on at once. I 
shouldn't have asked you to — " 

But Nodalictha said unhappily, 
"It isn't you, Rhadampsicus. It's 
me! While you've been watching 
the star, I've amused myself 
watching those quaint little creatures on the second planet. I've 
thought of them as — well, as 
pets. I've grown fond of them. It 
was absurd of me — " 

"Oh, but it is wonderful of 
you," said Rhadampsicus tenderly. "I love you all the more for 
it, my darling. But why are you 
unhappy about them? I made 
sure they had food and energy." 

"They're going to be burned 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



141 



up!" wailed Nodalictha, "and 
they're so cute!" 

Rhadampsicus blinked his eyes 
— all sixteen of them. Then he 
said self-accusingly, "My dear, 
I should have thought of that. 
Of course this is only a ftare-up, 
darling . . ." Then he made an 
impatient gesture. "I see! You 
would rather think of them as 
happy, in their little way, than as 
burned to tiny crisps." 

He considered, scanning the 
second planet with the normal 
anxiety of a bridegroom to do 
anything that would remove a 
cloud from his bride's lovely sixteen eyes. 

NIGHT fell on Cetopolis, and 
with it came some slight alleviation of the dreadfulness that 
had begun that afternoon. The 
air was furnacelike in heat and 
dryness. There was the smell of 
smoke everywhere. The -stars 
were faint and red and ominous, 
seen through the smoke that overlay everything. So far, to be sure, 
breathing was possible. It was 
even possible to be comfortable 
in an air-conditioned room. But 
this was only the beginning. 

Lon and Cathy sat together on 
the porch of his house, after sundown. The other colonists had 
gone away to their own homes. 
When the crack of " doom has 
visibly begun, men do queer 
things. In Cetopolis some un


doubtedly got drunk, or tried to. 
But there were farmers who 
would spend this last night looking at their , drooping crops, trying to persuade themselves that 
if Cetis Gamma only went back 
to normal before sunrise, the 
crops might yet be saved. But 
none of them expected it. 

Off to the south there was an 
angry reddish glare in the sky. 
That was vegetation on the desert there, burning. It grew thick 
as jungle in the rainy season, 
and dried out to pure dessication 
in dry weather. It had caught 
fire of itself from the sun's glare 
in late afternoon. Great clouds of 
acrid smoke rose from it to the 
stars. 

Beyond the horizon to the_west 
there was destruction. 

Lon and Cathy sat close together. She hadn't even asked to 
be taken back to Cetopolis, as 
convention would have required. 
The sun was growing hotter still 
while it sank below the horizon, 
It was expanding in fits and 
starts as new writhing spouts of 
stuff from its interior burst the 
bonds of gravity. Blazing magma 
flung upward in an unthinkable 
eruption. The sun had been three 
times normal size when it set. 

Lon was no astronomer, but 
plainly the end of life on the 
inner planets of Cetis Gamma 
was at hand. 

Cetis Gamma might, he con


142 




 



sidered, be in the process of becoming a nova. Certainly beyond 
the horizon there was even more 
terrible heat than had struck the 
human colony before sundown. 
Even if the sun did not explode, 
even if it was only as fiercely 
blazing as at its setting, they 
would die within hours after sunrise. If it increased in brightness, 
by daybreak its first rays would 
be death itself. When dawn came, 
the very first direct beams would 
set the shiver trees alight on 
the hilltops, and as it rose the 
fires would go down into the valleys. This house would smoke and 
writhe and melt; the air would 
become flame, and the planet's 
surface would glow red-hot as it 
turned into the sunshine. 

"TT'S going to be— all right, 
-"- Lon," Cathy said unconvincedly. "It's just something 
happening that'll be over in a 
little while. But — in case it isn't 
— we might as well be together. 
Don't you think so?" 

Lon put his arm comfortingly 
around her. He felt a very strong 
impulse to lie. He could pretend 
to vast wisdom and tell her the 
sun's behavior was this or that, 
and never lasted more than a few 
v hours, but she'd know he lied. 
They could spend their last hours 
trying to deceive each other out 
of pure affection. But they'd 
know it was deceit. 



"D-don'r you think so?" insisted Cathy faintly. 

He said gently, "No, Cathy, 
and neither do you. This is the 
finish. It would've been a lot 
nicer to go on living, the two of 
us. We'd have had long, long 
years to be together. We'd have 
had kids, and they'd have grown 
up, and we'd have had— a lot of 
things. But now I'm afraid we 
won't." 

He tried to smile at her, but 
it hurt. He thought passionately 
that he would gladly submit himself to be burned in the slowest 
and most excruciating manner 
if only she could be saved from 
it. But he couldn't do anything. 

Cathy gulped. "I — I'm afraid 
so, too, Lon," she said in a small 
voice. "But it's nice we met each 
other, anyhow. Now we know we 
love each other. I don't like the 
idea of dying, but I'm glad we 
knew we loved each other before 
it happened." 

Lon's hands clenched fiercely. 
Then the rage went away. He 
said almost humorously, "Carson 
—he's back in Cetopolis. I wonder how he feels. He has no better 
chance than anybody else. Maybe he's sent off spacegrams, but 
no ship could possibly get here in 
time." 

Cathy shivered a little. "Let's 
not think about him. Just about 
us. We haven't much time." 

And just then, very strangely, 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



143 



an idea came to Lon Simpson. 
He tensed. 

After a moment, he said in a 
very queer voice, "This isn't a 
nova. It's a flare-up. The sun isn't 
exploding. It's just too hot, too 
big for the temperature inside it, 
and it's a closed system. So radiation pressure has been building 
up. Now it's got to be released. 
So it will spout geysers of its 
own substance. They'll go out 
over hundreds of thousands of 
miles. But in a couple of weeks 
it will be back — nearly — -to normal." 

He suddenly knew that. He 
knew why it was so. He could 
have explained it completely and 
precisely. But he didn't know how 
he knew. The items that added 
together were themselves so self 
evident that he didn't even wonder how he knew them. They had 
to be so! 

CATHY said muffledly, her 
face against his shoulder, 
"But we won't be alive in a 
couple of weeks, Lon. We can't 
live long past daybreak." 

He did not answer. There were 
more ideas coming into his mind. 
He didn't know where they came 
from. But again they were such 
self evident, unquestionable facts 
that he did not wonder about 
them. He simply paid tense, desperately concentrated attention 
as they formed themselves. 



"We — may live," he said shakily. "There's an ionosphere up at 
the top of the atmosphere here, 
just like there is on Earth. It's 
made by the sunlight ionizing the 
thin air. The — stronger sunlight 
will multiply the ionization. 
There'll be an — actually conducting layer of air . . . Yes . . . 
The air will become a conductor, 
up there." He wet his lips. "If I 
make a — gadget to — short-circuit 
that conducting layer to the 
ground here . . . When radiation 
photons penetrate a transparent 
conductor — but there aren't any 
transparent conductors — the photons will — follow the three-finger 
rule ... 

"They'll move at right angles 
to their former course — " 

He swallowed. Then he got up 
very quietly. He put her aside. 
He went to his tool shed. He 
climbed to the roof of the barn 
now filled with thanar leaves. He 
swung his axe. 

The barn was roofed with 
aluminum over malleable plastic. 
The useful property of malleable 
plastic is that it does not yield to 
steady pressure, but does yield 
to shock. It will stay in shape indefinitely under a load, but one 
can tap it easily into any form 
one desires. 

Lon swung his axe, head down. 
Presently he asked Cathy to 
climb up a ladder and hold a 
lantern for him. He didn't need " 



144 




 



light for the rough work — the 
burning desert vegetation gave 
enough for that. But when one 
wants to make a parabolic reflector by tapping with an axe, one 
needs light for the finer part of 
the job. 

TN Cetopolis, Carson agitatedly 
put his records on tape and 
sent it all off by spacegram. He'd 
previously reported on Lon Simpson, but now he knew that he was 
going to die. And he followed his 
instinct to transmit all his quite 
useless records, in order that his 
superiors might realize he had 
been an admirable employee. It 
did not occur to him that his superiors might be trying frantically to break his sending beam to 
demand that he find out how Lon 
Simpson made his power gadget 
and how he converted vegetation, 
before it was too late. They 
didn't succeed in breaking his 
beam, because Carson kept it 
busy. 

He was true to type. 

Elsewhere, other men were true 
to type, too. The human population of Cetis Gamma Two was 
very small. There were less than 
five thousand people on the planet — all within a hundred miles of 
Cetopolis, and all now on. the 
night side. The rest of the planet's land masses scorched and 
shriveled and burst into flame 
where the sun struck them. The 



few small oceans heated and 
their surfaces even boiled. But 
nobody saw it. The local fauna 
and flora died over the space of 
continents. 

But in the human settlement 
area, people acted according to 
their individual natures. Some 
few ran amok and tried to 
destroy everything — including 
themselves — before the blazing 
sun could return to do it. More 
sat in stunned silence, waiting 
for doom. A few dug desperately, 
trying to excavate caves or pits 
in which they or their wives or 
children could be safe . . . 

But Lon pounded at his barn 
roof. He made a roughly parabolic mirror some three yards 
across. He stripped off aluminum 
siding and made a connection 
with the ground. He poured 
water around that connection. 
He built a crude multiply twisted 
device of copper wire and put it 
in the focus of the parabolic 
mirror. 

He looked up at the sky. The 
stars seemed dimmer. He took 
the copper thing away, and they 
brightened a little. He carefully 
adjusted it until the stars were 
at their dimmest. 

He descended to the ground 
again. He felt an odd incredulity 
about what he'd done. He didn't 
doubt that it would work. He 
was simply unable to understand 
how he'd thought of it. 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



145 



"rpHERE, darling! Your pets 
-■- are quite safe!" Rhadampsicus said pleasedly. 

Nodalictha scanned the second 
planet. It was apparently coated 
with a metallic covering. But it 
was not quite like metal. It was 
misty, like an unsubstantial barrier to light — and to Nodalictha's 
penetrating thoughts. 

"I had your male pet," Rhadampsicus explained tenderly, 
"set up a power beam link to the 
ionosphere. With several times 
the usual degree of ionization — 
because of the flaring sun — :the 
grounded ionosphere became a 
Rhinthak screen about the planet. 
The more active the sun, the 
more dense the screen. They'll 
have light to see by when their 
side of the planet is toward the 
sun, but no harmful radiation 
can get down to them. And the 
screen will fade away as the sun 
goes back to its normal state." 

Nodalictha rejoiced. Then she 
was a little distressed. 

"But now I can't watch them!" 
she pouted. Rhadampsicus watched her gravely. She said ruefully, 
"I see, Rhadampsicus. You've 
spoiled me! But if I can't watch 
them for the time being, I won't 
have anything to occupy me. 
Darling Rhadampsicus, you must 
talk to me sometimes!" 

He talked to her absorbedly. 
He seemed to think, however, that 
discussion of the local solar phe


nomena was conversation. With 
feminine guile, she pretended to 
be satisfied, but presently she 
went back to her housekeeping. 
She began to dream of their life 
when they had returned home, 
and of the residence they would 
inhabit there. Presently she was 
planning the parties she would 
give as a young matron, with 
canapes of krypton snow and zenon ice, with sprinklings of lovely 
red nickel bromide crystals for 
a garnish — 

r | iHE sun rose again, and they 
lived. It was as if the sky were 
covered with a thick cloud bank 
which absorbed the monstrous 
radiation of a sun now four times 
its previous diameter and madly 
changing shape like a monstrous 
ameba of flame. 

In time the sun set. It rose 
again. It set. And Cetis Gamma 
Two remained a living planet 
instead of being a scorched cinder. 

When four days had gone by 
and nobody died, the colonists 
decided that they might actually 
keep on living. They had at first 
no especially logical foundation 
for their belief. 

But Cathy boasted. And she 
boasted in Cetopolis. Since they 
were going to keep on living, the 
conventions required that she return to the planet's one human 
settlement and her duties as a 
beamphone operator. It wasn't 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



147 



proper for her to stay unchaperoned so long as she and Lon 
weren't married yet. 

She had no difficulty with Carson. He didn't refer to her desertion. Carson had his own 
troubles. Now that he had decided 
that he would live, his problems 
multiplied. The colonists' barns 
were rilled to capacity with thanar 
leaves which would pay off their 
debts to the Company. He began 
to worry about that. 
, Lost without the constant directives from the Company, he 
had his technicians step up the 
power in the settlement transmitter. He knew that the screen 
Lon had put up would stop ordinary spacegram transmission. 
Even with a tight beam,* he could 
broadcast and receive only at 
night, when the screen was thinnest. Even so, he had to search 
out holes in the screen. 

The system didn't work perfectly — it wasn't two-way at all, 
until the Company stepped up 
the power in its own transmitter 
— but spacegrams started to get 
through again. 

Carson smiled in relief. He began to regain some of his old 
arrogantly bored manner. Now 
that the Company's guiding hand 
was once more with him, nothing 
seemed as bad as it had been. He 
was able to report that •something 
had happened to save the colony 
from extinction, and that Lon 



Simpson had probably done it. 

In return, he got a spacegram 
demanding full particulars, and 
precise information on the devices he had reported Lon Simpson to have made. 

Humbly, Carson obeyed his 
corporation. 

TTE pumped Cathy- — which was 
not difficult, because she was 
bursting with pride in Lon. She 
confirmed, in detail, the rumor 
that Lon was somehow responsible for the protective screen 
that was keeping eyerybody alive. 

Carson sent the information by 
spacegram. He was informed that 
a special Company ship was 
heading for Cetis Gamma Two at 
full speed. Carson would take 
orders from its skipper when it 
arrived. Meanwhile, he would buy 
thanar leaf if absolutely necessary, but stall as long as possible. 
The legal staff of the Trading 
Company was working on the 
problem of adapting the system 
to get the new surplus supplies of 
thanar without letting anybody 
get anything in particular for it. 
He would keep secret the coming 
of the special ship, which was 
actually the space yacht of a 
member of the Board of Directors. 
And he would display great 
friendliness toward Lon Simpson. 

The last was the difficult part, 
because Lon Simpson was becoming difficult. With the sun 



148 




 



writhing as if in agony overhead 
— seen dimly through a permanent blessed mistiness — and 
changing shape from hour to 
hour, Lon Simpson had discovered something new to get mad 
about. Lon had felt definitely on 
top of the world. He had solved 
the problem of clearing his debts 
and getting credit sufficient for 
two passages back to Earth, with 
money there to take care of getting rich on his inventions. There 
was no reason to delay marriage. 
He wanted to get married. And 
through a deplorable oversight, 
there had been no method devised 
by which a legal marriage ceremony could be performed on 
Cetis Gamma Two. 

It was one of those accidental 
omissions which would presently 
be rectified. But the legal minds 
who'd set up the system for the 
planet had been thinking of money, not marriages. They hadn't 
envisioned connubial bliss as a 
service the Company should provide. And Lon was raising cain. 
His barn was literally bursting 
with thanar leaves, and he was 
filling up his attic, extra bedroom, 
living quarters and kitchen with 
"more. He was rich. He wanted to 
get married. And it wasn't possible. 

Lon was in a position to raise 
much more cain than ordinary. 
He'd made an amicable bargain 
with his fellow colonists. They 



brought truckloads of miscellaneous foliage to be put into his 
vegetation converter," and he converted it all into thanar leaves. 
The product was split two ways. 
Everybody was happy — except 
Carson — Because every colonist 
had already acquired enough 
thanar leaf to pay himself out of 
debt, and was working on extra 
capital. 

If this kept up, the galactic 
market would be broken. 

Carson had nightmares about 
that. 

CO the sun went through convulsions in emptiness, and nobody on its second planet paid 
any attention at all. After about 
a week, it occasionally subsided. 
When that happened, the ionization of the planet's upper atmosphere lessened, the radiation 
screen grew thinner, and a larger 
proportion of light reached the 
surface. When the sun flared 
higher, the shield automatically 
grew thicker. An astronomical 
phenomenon which should have 
destroyed all life on the inner 
planets came to be taken for 
granted. 

But events on the second planet were not without consequences 
elsewhere. The Board of Directors 
of the Cetis Gamma Trading 
Company simultaneously jittered 
and beamed with anticipation. If 
Lon could convert one form of 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



149 



vegetable product into another, 
then the Company's monopoly of 
thanar would vanish as soon as 
he got loose with his device. On 
the other hand, if the Company 
could get that device for its very 
own ... 

Thanar had a practically unlimited market. Every year a 
new age group of the population 
needed a milligram a day to keep 
old age away. But besides that, 
there - was Martian zuss fiber, 
which couldn't be marketed because there wasn't enough of it, 
but would easily fetch a thousand 
credits a kilo if Lon's gadget 
could produce it from samples. 
There was that Arcturian sicces 
dust — the pollen of an inordinately rare plant on Arcturus Four — 
which could be sold at more than 
its weight in diamonds, for perfume. And — 

The directors of the Company 
shivered over what might happen; and gloated over what 
could. So they kept their fingers 
crossed while the space yacht of 
one of their number sped toward 
Cetis Gamma Two, manned by 
very trustworthy men who would 
carry out their instructions with 
care and vigor and no nonsense 
about it. 

Lon Simpson worked with his 
neighbors, converting all sorts of 
vegetable debris — the ' fact that 
some of it was scorched did not 
seem to matter — into thanar leaf 



which was sound legal tender on .| 
that particular planet. From time ; 
to time he went to Cetopolis. He 
talked sentimentally and yearningly to Cathy. And then he went 
to Carson's office and raised the 
very devil because there was as 
yet no arrangement by which he 
and Cathy could enter into the 
state of holy matrimony. 

RHADAMPSICUS looked over 
his notes and was very well 
pleased. He explained to Nodalictha that from now on the return 
of Cetis Gamma to its normal 
condition would be a cut-anddried affair. He would like to 
stay and watch it, but the important phenomena were all over 
now. He said solicitously that if 
she wanted to go on, completing 
their nuptial journey . . . She 
might be anxious to see her family and friends . . . She might be 
lonely ... 

Nodalictha smiled at him. The 
process would have been horrifying to a human who watched, 
but Rhadampsicus smiled back. 

"Lonely?" asked Nodalictha 
coyly. "With you, Rhadampsicus?" 

He impulsively twined his eye 
stalks about hers. A little later 
he was saying tenderly, "Then 
I'll just finish my observations, 
darling, and we'll go on — since 
you don't mind waiting." 

"I'd like to see my pets again," 



150 




 



said Nodalictha, nestling comfortably against him. 

Together, they scanned the second planet, but their thoughts 
could not penetrate its Rhinthak 
screen. They saw the space yacht 
flash up to it. Rhadampsicus inspected the minds of the bipeds 
inside it. Nodalictha, of course, 
modestly refrained from entering 
the minds of male creatures other 
than her husband. 

"Peculiar," commented Rhadampsicus. "Very peculiar. If I 
were a sociologist, I might find it 
less baffling. But they must have 
a very queer sort of social system. They actually intend to 
harm your pets, Nodalictha, because the male now knows how 
to supply them all with food and 
energy! Isn't that strange? I 
wish the Rhinthak screen did not 
block off scanning ... But it 
will fade, presently." 

"You will keep the others from 
harming my pets," said Nodalictha confidently. "Do you know, 
darling, I think I must be quite 
the luckiest person in the Galaxy, 
to be married, to you." 

rwiHE space yacht landed at the 
•■- field outside Cetopolis. Inhabitants of the tiny town nocked 
to the field to see new faces. They 
were disappointed. One man came 
out and the airlock closed. No 
visitors. 

The skipper went into Carson's 



office. He closed the door firmly 
behind him. He had very beady 
eyes and a very hard-boiled expression. He looked at Carson 
with open contempt, and Carson 
felt that it was because Carson 
did the Company's dirty work 
with figures and due regard for 
law and order, instead of frankly 
and violently and without shillyshallying. 

"This Lon Simpson's got those 
gadgets, eh?" asked the skipper. 

"Why — yes," said Carson unhappily. "He's very popular at 
the moment. He made something 
on his barn roof that kept the sun 
from burning us all to death, you 
know — that still keeps us from 
burning to death, for that matter." 

"So if we take it away or smash 
it," observed the skipper, "we 
don't have to worry about anybody saying nasty things about 
us afterward. Yeah?" 

Carson swallowed. 

"Everybody' d die if you smashed the gadget," he admitted, "but 
all the thanar plants in existence 
would be burned up, too. There'd 
be no more thanar. The Company 
wouldn't like that." 

The skipper waved his hand. 
"How do I get this Simpson on 
my ship? Take a bunch of my 
men and go grab him?" 

"Wh-what are you going to do 
with him?" 

"Don't you worry," said the 



THE SENTIMENTALIST?

skipper comfortingly. "We know 
how to handle it. He knows how 
to make some things the bosses 
want to know how to make. Once 
I get him on the ship, he'll tell. 
We got ways. Do I take some men 
and grab him, or will you get him 
on board peaceable?" 

"There — ah — " Carson licked 
his lips. "He wants to get married. There's no provision in the 
legal code for it, as yet. It was 
overlooked. But I can tell him 
that as a ship captain, you — " 

The skipper nodded matter of 
factly. 

"Right. You get him and the 
girl on board. And I've got some 
orders for you. Gather up plenty 
of thanar seed. Get some starting 
trays with young plants in them. 
I'll come back in a couple of 
days and take you and them on 
board. The stuff this guy has got 
is too good, understand?" 

"N-no. I'm afraid I don't." 

I GET this guy to tell us how 
to make his gadgets," the 
skipper explained contemptuously. "We make sure he tells us 
right. To be extra sure, we leave 
the gadgets he's got made and 
working back here, where he can't 
get to 'em and spoil 'em. But 
when we know all he knows — and 
what he only guesses, ■ too, and 
my tame scientists have made 
the same kinda gadgets, an' they 
work — why, we come back and 



pick you up, and the thanar seed 
and the young growing plants. 
Then we get the gadgets this guy 
made here, and we head back for 
Earth." 

"But if you take the gadget 
that keeps us all from being 
burned up — " Carson said agitatedly, "if you do, everybody 
here — " 

"Won't that be too bad!" the 
skipper said ironically. "But you 
won't be here. You'll be on the 
yacht. Don't worry. Now go fix 
it for the girl and him to walk 
into our parlor." 

Carson's hand shook as he 
reached for the beamphone. His 
voice was not quite normal as he 
explained to Cathy in the exchange that the skipper of the 
space yacht had the legal power 
to perform marriage ceremonies 
in space. And Carson, as a gesture 
of friendship to one of the most 
prominent colonists, had asked if 
the captain would oblige Cathy 
and Lon. The captain had agreed. 
If they made haste, he would 
take them out in space and marry 
them. 

The skipper of the space yacht 
regarded him with undisguised 
scorn when he hung up the phone 
and mopped his face. 

"Pretty girl, eh?" he asked contemptuously, "and you didn't 
have the nerve to grab her for 
yourself?" He did not wait for 
an answer. "I'll look her over. 



152 




 



You get your stuff ready for 
when I come back in a couple of 
days." 

"But — when you release them," 
Carson said shakily, "They'll report — " 

The skipper looked at Carson 
without any expression at all. 
Then he went out. 

Carson felt sick. But he was a 
very loyal employee of the Cetis 
Gamma Trading Company. 
From the windows of his air-conditioned office, he watched Lon 
Simpson greet Cathy on his arrival in Cetopolis. He saw Cathy 
put a sprig of chanel blossoms on 
the lapel of her very best suit, in 
lieu of a bridal bouquet. And he 
watched them go with shining 
faces toward the airport. He 
didn't try to stop them. 

Later he heard the space yacht 
take off. 

lyrODALICTHA prepared to 
^ share the thoughts and the 
happiness of the female biped 
whose emotions were familiar, 
since Nodalictha was so recently 
a bride herself. Rhadampsicus 
was making notes, but he gallantly ceased when Nodalictha 
called to him. They sat, then, before their crude but comfortable 
bower on the ninth planet, all set 
to share the quaint rejoicing of 
the creatures of which Nodalictha had grown fond. 

Nodalictha penetrated the 



thoughts of the female, in pleased 
anticipation. Rhadampsicus scanned the mind of the male, and his 
expression changed. He shifted 
his thought to another and another of the bipeds in the ship's 
company. He spoke with some 
distaste. 

"The ones you consider your 
pets, Nodalictha, are amiable 
enough. But the others — " He 
frowned. "Really, darling, if you 
went into their minds, you'd be 
most displeased. They are quite 
repulsive. Let's forget about them 
and start for home. If you really 
care for pets, we've much more 
suitable creatures there." 

Nodalictha pouted. 

"Rhadampsicus, let's just 
watch their marriage ceremony. 
It is so cute to think of little creatures like that loving each other 
— and marrying — " 

Rhadampsicus withdrew his 
thought from the space yacht and 
looked about the charming rural 
retreat he and Nodalictha had 
occupied. Its nitrogen-snow walls 
glittered in the starlight. The garden of cyanogen flowers and the 
border of ammonia crystals and 
the walkway of monoclinic sulphur, and the reflection pool of 
liquid hydrogen he'd installed in 
an odd half hour. These were 
simple, but they were delightful. 
The crudity of the space yacht 
with its. metal walls so curiously 
covered over with a coating of 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



153 



lead oxide in hardened oil, and 
the vegetable gum flooring . . . 
Rhadampsicus did not like the 
surroundings men made for themselves in space. 

"Very well, darling," he said 
resignedly. "We will watch, and 
then we'll take off for home. I'm 
anxious to see what the modernists have to say when I show 
them my notes on this flare-up. 
— And of course," he added with 
grave humor, "you want to show 
your family that I haven't illtreated you." 

He was the barest trace impatient, but Nodalictha's thoughts 
were with the female biped in the 
spaceship. Her expression was 
distressed. 

"Rhadampsicus!" she said angrily. "The other bipeds are being unkind to my pets! Do 
something! I don't like them!" 

A SAILOR in a soiled uniform 
led them into the space 
yacht's saloon. The airlock clanked shut, and the yacht soared for 
the skies. The sailor vanished. 
Nobody else came near. Then 
Lon stiffened. He got the flavor 
of his surroundings. He had 
Cathy with him. On her account, 
his flesh crawled suddenly. 

This was a space yacht, but of 
a very special kind. It was a 
pleasure ship. The decorations 
were subtly disgusting. There 
were pictures on the walls, and 



at first glance they were pretty 
enough, but on second glance 
they were disquieting, and when 
carefully examined they were 
elaborately and allusively monstrous. This was the yacht of 
someone denying that anything 
could be more desirable than 
pleasure — and who took his pleasure in a most unattractive fashion. 

Lon grasped this much, and it 
occurred to him that the crew of 
such a yacht would be chosen for 
its willingness to cooperate in its 
owner's enterprises. And Lon 
went somewhat pale, for Cathy 
was with him. 

The ship went up and up, with 
the dark shutters over the ports 
showing that it was in sunshine 
fierce enough to be dangerous on 
unshielded flesh. Presently there 
was the feel of maneuvering. After a time the shutters flipped 
open and stars were visible. 

Lon went quickly to a port and 
looked out. The great black mass 
of the night side of Cetis Gamma 
Two filled half the firmament. It 
blotted out the sun. The space 
yacht might be two or three thousand miles up and in the planet's 
umbra — its shadow — which was 
not necessary for a space wedding, or for anything involving a 
reasonably brief stay in the excessive heat Cetis Gamma gave 
off. 

There were clankings. A door 



154 




 



opened. The skipper came in and 
Cathy smiled at him because she 
didn't realize Lon's fierce apprehension. Four other men followed, 
all in soiled and untidy space 
yacht uniforms, then two other 
men in more ordinary clothing. 
Their expressions were distinctly 
uneasy. 

The four sailors walked matter 
of factly over to Lon and grabbed 
at him. They should have taken 
him completely by surprise, but 
he had been warned just enough 
to explode into battle. It was a 
very pretty fight, for a time. Lon 
kept three of them busy. One 
snarled with a wrenched wrist, 
another spat blood and teeth and 
a third had a closed eye before 
the fourth swung a chair. Then 
Lon hit something with his head. 
It was the deck, but he didn't 
know it. 

IW/'HEN he came to, he was 
™* hobbled. He was not bound 
so he couldn't move, but his 
hands were handcuffed together, 
with six inches of chain between 
for play. His ankles were similarly restricted. He could move, 
but he could not fight. Blood was 
trickling down his temple and 
somebody was holding his head 
up. 

The skipper said impatiently, 
"All right, stand back." 

Lon's head was released. The 
skipper jerked a thumb. Men 



went out. Lon looked about desperately for "Cathy. She was there 
— dead white and terrified, but 
apparently unharmed. She stared 
at Lon in wordless pleading. 

"You're a suspicious guy, 
aren't you?" asked the skipper 
sardonically. "Somebody lays a 
finger on you and you start fighting. But you've got the idea. I'll 
say it plain so we can get moving. You're Lon Simpson. Carson, down on the planet, reported 
some nice news about you. You 
made a gadget that converts any 
sort of leaf to thanar. Maybe it 
turns stuff to other stuff, too." He 
paused. "We want to know how 
to make gadgets like that. You're 
gonna draw plans an' explain the 
theory. I got guys here to listen. 
We're gonna make one, from your 
plans an' explanations, an' it'd 
better work. See?" 

"Carson sent for you to do 
this," Lon Simpson said thickly. 

"He did. The Company wants 
it. They'll use it to make zuss 
fiber and sicces dust, and stuff 
like that. Maybe dream dust, too, 
an' so on. The point is you're 
gonna tell us how to make those 
gadgets. How about it?" 

Lon licked his lips. He said 
slowly, "I think there's more. Go 
on." 

"You made another gadget," 
said the skipper, with relish, 
"that turns out power without 
fuel. The Company wants that, 



THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



155 



too. Spacelines will pay for it. 
Cities will pay for it. It ought 
to be a pretty nice thing. You're 
gonna make plans and explanations of how that works and we're 
gonna make sure they're right. 
That clear?" 

"Will you let us go when I've 
told you?" Lon asked bitterly. 

"Not without one more gadget," the skipper added amiably. 
"You made something that put a 
screen around the planet yonder, 
so it didn't get burned up. It'd 
oughta be useful. The company 
'11 put one around Mercury. 
Convenient for minin' operations. 
One around that planet that's too 
close to Sirius. Oh, there's plenty 
of places that'll be useful. So 
you'll get set to draw up the 
plans for that, too — and explanations of how it works. Then we'll 
talk about lettin' you go." 

T ON knew that he wouldn't be 
let go in any case. Not after 
he'd told them what was wanted. 
Not by men who'd work on a 
pleasure craft like this. Not* with 
Cathy a prisoner with him. But 
he might as well get all the cards 
down. 

"And if I won't tell you what 
you want to know?" he asked. 

The skipper shrugged his 
shoulders. "You were knocked 
out a while," he said without 
heat. "While we were waitin' for 
you to come to, we told her — " 



he jerked his thumb at Cathy — 
"what would happen to her if 
you weren't obligin'. We told her 
plenty. She knows we mean it. 
We won't hurt you until we've 
finished with her. So you'd better 
get set to talk. I'll let her see if 
she can persuade you peaceable. 
I'll give her ten minutes." 

He went out. The door clicked 
shut behind him and Lon knew 
that this was the finish. He looked 
at Cathy's dazed, horror-filled 
eyes. He knew this wasn't a bluff. 
He was up against the same system that had brought colonists to 
Certs Gamma, Two. The brains 
that had planned that system had 
planned this. They'd gotten completely qualified men to do their 
dirty work in both cases. 

"Lon, darling! Please kill me!" 
Cathy said in a hoarse whisper. 

He looked at her in astonishment. 

"Please kill me!" repeated 
Cathy desperately. "They — they 
can't ever dare let us go, Lon, 
after what they've told me! 
They've got to kill us both. But 
— Lon, darling — please kill me 
first ..." 

An idea came into Lon's mind. 
He surveyed it worriedly. He 
knew that he would have to tell 
what he knew and then he would 
be killed. The Cetis Gamma 
Trading Company wanted his inventions, and it would need him 
dead after it had them. 



156 




 



The idea was hopeless, but he 
had to try it. They knew he'd 
made gadgets which did remarkable things. If he made something 
now and persuaded them that it 
was a weapon . . . 

His flesh crawled with horror. 
Not for himself, but for Cathy. 
He fumbled in his. pockets. A 
pocket knife. A key chain. String. 
His face was completely gray. He 
ripped an upholstered seat. There 
were coiled springs under the 
foamite. He pulled away a piece 
of decorative molding. He knew 
it wouldn't work, but there wasn't 
anything else to do. His hands 
moved awkwardly, with the 
handcuffs limiting their movements. 

Time passed. He had something finished. It was a bit of 
wood with a coil spring from the 
chair, with his key chain wrapped 
around it and his pocket knife 
set in it so that the blade would 
seem to make a contact. But it 
would achieve nothing whatever. 

Cathy stared at him. Her eyes 
were desperate, but she believed. 
She'd seen three equally improbable devices perform wonders. 
While Lon made something that 
looked like the nightmare of an 
ultimatist sculptor, she watched 
in terrified hope. 

TTE HAD it in his hand when 
the door opened again and 
the skipper came back into the 



saloon. He said prosaically, "Shall 
I call in the scientist guys to listen, or the persuader guys to work 
on her?" 

"Neither. I've made another 
gadget," Lon said from a dry 
throat. "It will kill you. It'll kill 
everybody on the ship — from 
here. You're going to put us back 
down on the planet below." 

The skipper did not look at the 
gadget, but at Lon's face. Then 
he called. The fouj, men of the 
crew and the two uneasy scientists came in. 

"We got to persuade," the skipper said sardonically. "He just 
told me he's made a new gadget 
that'll kill us all." 

He moved unhurriedly toward 
Lon. Lon knew that his bluff was 
no good. If the thing had actually been a weapon, he'd have 
been confident and assured. He 
didn't feel that way, but he raised 
the thing menacingly as the skipper approached. 

The skipper took it away, 
laughing. 

"We'll tie him in a chair an' 
get to work on her. When he's 
ready to talk, we'll stop." He 
looked at the object in his hands. 
It was ridiculous to look at. It 
was as absurd as the device that 
extracted power from matter 
stresses, and the machine that 
converted one kind of vegetation 
into another, and the apparatus — 
partly barn roof — that had short 


THE SENTIMENTALISTS 



157 



cuited the ionosphere of Cetis 
Gamma Two to the planet's solid 
surface. It looked very foolish indeed. 

The skipper was amused. 

"Look out, you fellas," he said 
humorously. "It's gonna kill 
you!" 

He crooked his finger and the 
knifeblade made a contact. He 
swept it in mock menace about 
the saloon. The four crew-members and the two scientists went 
stiff. He gaped at them, then 
turned the device to stare at it 
incredulously. He came within its 
range. 

He stiffened. Off-balance, he 
fell on the device, breaking its 
gimcrack fastenings and the contact which transmitted nothing 
that Lon Simpson could imagine 
coming out of it. The others fell, 
one by one, with peculiarly solid 
impacts. 

Their flesh was incredibly hard. 
It was as solid, in fact, as so 
much mahogany. 

TVTODALICTHA said warmly, 
^- ' "You're a darling, Rhadampsicus! It was outrageous of those 
nasty creatures to intend to harm 
my pets! I'm glad you attended 
to them!" 

"And I'm glad you're pleased, 
my dear," Rhadampsicus said 
pleasantly. "Now shall we set out 
for home?" 

Nodalictha looked about the 



cosy landscape of the ninth planet 
of Cetis Gamma. There were jagged peaks of frozen air, and 
mountain ranges of water, solidified ten thousand aeons ago. 
There were frost-trees of nitrogen, the elaborate crystal formations of argon, and here a wide 
sweep of oxygen crystal sward, 
with tiny peeping wild crystals 
of deep-blue cyanogen seeming to 
grow more thickly by the brook 
of liquid hydrogen. And there was 
their bower; primitive, but the 
scene of a true honeymoon idyll. 

"I almost hate to go home, 
Rhadampsicus," Nodalictha said. 
"We've been so happy here. Will 
you remember it for always?" 

"Naturally," said Rhadampsicus. "I'm glad you've been happy-" 

Nodalictha snuggled up to him 
and twined eye stalks with him. 

"Darling," she said softly, 
"you've been wonderful, and I've 
been spoiled, and you've let me 
be. But I'm going to be a very 
dutiful wife from now on, Rhadampsicus. Only jt has been fun, 
having you be so nice to me!" 

"It's been fun for me, too," 
replied Rhadampsicus gallantly. 

Nodalictha took a last glance 
around, and each of her sixteen 
eyes glowed sentimentally. Then 
she scanned the far-distant spaceship in the shadow of the second 
planet from the now subsiding 
sun. 



158 




 



"My pets," she said tenderly. 
"But — Rhadampsicus, what are 
they doing?" 

"They've discovered that the 
crew of their vehicle — they call it 
a space yacht— aren't dead, that 
they're only in suspended animation. And they've decided in some , 
uneasiness that they'd better take 
them back to Earth to be revived." 

"How nice! I knew they were 
sweet little creatures!" 

Rhadampsicus hesitated a moment. 

"From the male's mind I gather 
something else. Since the crew of 
this space yacht was incapacitated, and they were — ah — not 
employed on it, he and your fe^ 
male will bring it safely to port, 
and, I gather that they have a 
claim to great reward. Ah — it is 
something they call 'salvage.' He 
plans to use it to secure other 
rewards he calls 'patents' and 
they expect to live happily ever 
after." 

"And," cried Nodalictha gleefully, "from the female's mind I 
know that she is very proud of 
him, because she doesn't know 
that you designed all the instruments he made, darling. She's 
speaking to him now, telling him 
she loves him very dearly." 

Then Nodalictha blushed a little, because in a faraway space 
yacht Cathy had kissed Lon 
Simpson. The process seemed 



highly indecorous to Nodalictha, 
so recently a bride. 

"Yes," said Rhadampsicus, drily. "He is returning the compliment. It is quaint to think of 
such small creatures — Ha! Nodalictha, you should be pleased 
again. He is telling her that they 
will be married when they reach 
Earth, and that she shall have a 
white dress and a veil and a train. 
But I am afraid we cannot follow to witness the ceremony." 

Their tentacles linked and their 
positron blasts mingling, the two 
of them soared up from the surface of the ninth planet of Cetis 
Gamma. They swept away, headed for their home at the extreme 
outer tip of the most far-flung 
arm of the spiral outposts of the 
Galaxy. 

"But still," said Nodalictha, as 
they swept through emptiness at 
a speed unimaginable to humans, 
"they're wonderfully cute." 

"Yes, darling," Rhadampsicus 
agreed, unwilling to start an argument so soon after the wedding. "But not as cute as you." 

|~|N THE space yacht, Lon 
Simpson tried to use his genius to invent a way to get his 
handcuffs and leg-irons off. He 
failed completely. 

Cathy had to get the keys out 
of the skipper's pocket and unlock 
them for him.

THERE ARE some things that can not be generally told— things you 
ought to know. Great truths are dangerous to some— but factors for 
personal power and accomplishment in the hands of those who understand them. Behind the tales of the miracles and mysteries of the 
ancients, lie centuries of their secret probing into nature's laws— their 
amazing discoveries of the hidden processes of man's mind, and fie 
mastery of life's problems. Once shrouded in mystery to avoid their 
destruction by mass fear and ignorance, these facts remain a useful 
heritage for the thousands of men and women who privately use them 
in their homes today.
