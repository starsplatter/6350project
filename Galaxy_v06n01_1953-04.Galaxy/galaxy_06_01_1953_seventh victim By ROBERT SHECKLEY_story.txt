seventh victim By ROBERT SHECKLEY 

STANTON Frelaine sat at 
his desk, trying to look as 
busy as an executive should 
at nine-thirty in the morning. It 
was impossible. He couldn't concentrate on the advertisement he had written the previous night, 
couldn't think about business. All 
he could do was wait until the 
mail came. 

He had been waiting for his 
notification for two weeks now. 
The government was behind 
schedule, as usual. 

The glass door of his office was 
marked Morger and Frelaine, 
Clothiers. It opened, and E. J. 
Morger walked in, limping slightly from his old gunshot wound. 
His shoulders were bent ; but at 
the age of seventy -three, he 
wasn't worrying too much about 
his posture. 

"Well, Stan?" Morger asked. 
"What about that ad?" 

Frelaine had joined Morger 
sixteen years ago, when he was 
twenty-seven. Together they had 
built Protec-Clothes into a million-dollar concern. 

"I suppose you can run it," 
Frelaine said, handing the slip of 
paper to Morger. If only the mail 
would come earlier, he thought. 

" 'Do you own a ProtecSuit?' " Morger read aloud, holding the paper close to his eyes. 
" 'The finest tailoring in the world 
has gone into Morger and Frelaine's Protec-Suit, to make it the 
leader in men's fashions.'" 

Morger cleared his throat and 
glanceH at Frelaine. He smiled 
and read on. 

" 'Protec-Suit is the safest as 
well as the smartest. Every Pro


tec-Suit comes with special builtin gun pocket, guaranteed not to 
bulge. No one will know you are 
carrying a gun — except you. The 
gun pocket is exceptionally easy 
to get at, permitting fast, unhindered draw. Choice of hip or 
breast pocket.' Very nice," Morger commented. 

Frelaine nodded morosely. 

" 'The Protec-Suit Special has 
the fling-out gun pocket, the 
greatest modern advance in personal protection. A touch of the 
concealed button throws the gun 
into your hand, cocked, safeties 
off. Why not drop into the Protec- Store nearest you? Why not 
be safe?' 

"That's fine," Morger said. 
"That's a very nice, dignified 
ad." He thought for a moment, 
fingering his white mustache. 
"Shouldn't you mention that 
Protec-Suits come in a variety of 
styles, single and double-breasted, one and two button rolls, deep 
and shallow flares?" 

"Right. I forgot." 

TT'RELAINE took back the 
sheet and jotted a note on the 
edge of it. Then he stood up, 
smoothing his jacket over his 
prominent stomach. Frelaine was 
forty-three, a little overweight, a 
little bald on top. He was an 
* amiable-looking man with cold 
eyes. 

"Relax," Morger said. "It'll

come in today's mail." 

Frelaine forced himself to 
smile. He felt like pacing the 
floor, but instead sat on the edge 
of the desk. 

"You'd think it was my first 
kill," he said, with a deprecating 
smile. 

"I know how it is," Morger 
said. "Before I hung up my gun, 
I couldn't sleep for a month, waiting for a notification. I know." 

The two men waited. Just as 
the silence was becoming unbearable, the door opened. A clerk 
walked in and deposited the mail 
on Frelaine's desk. 

Frelaine swung around and 
gathered up the letters. He 
thumbed through them rapidly 
and found what he had been 
waiting for — the long white envelope from ECB, with the official government seal on it. 

"That's it!" Frelaine said, and 
broke into a grin. "That's the 
baby!" 

"Fine." Morger eyed the envelope with interest, but didn't 
ask Frelaine to open it. It would 
be a breach of etiquette, as well 
as a violation in the eyes of the 
law. No one was supposed to 
know a Victim's name except his 
Hunter. "Have a good hunt." 

"I expect to," Frelaine replied confidently- His desk was 
in order — had been for a week. 
He picked up his briefcase. 

"A good kill will do you a 



world of good," Morger said, putting his hand lightly on Frelaine's 
padded shoulder. "You've been 
keyed up." 

"I know." Frelaine grinned 
again and shook Morger's hand. 

"Wish I was a kid again," Morger said, glancing down at his 
crippled leg with wryly humorous 
eyes. "Makes me want to pick 
up a gun again." 

The old man had been quite a 
Hunter in his day. Ten successful 
hunts had qualified him for the 
exclusive Tens Club. And, of 
course, for each hunt Morger had 
had to act as Victim, so he had 
twenty kills to his credit. 

"I sure hope my Victim isn't 
anyone like you," Frelaine said, 
half in jest. 

"Don't worry about it. What 
number will this be?" 

"The seventh." 

"Lucky seven. Go to it," Morger said. "We'll get you into the 
Tens yet." 

Frelaine waved his hand and 
started out the door. 

"Just don't get careless," 
warned Morger. "All it takes is a 
single slip and I'll need a new 
partner. If you don't mind, I like 
the one I've got now." 

"I'll be careful," Frelaine 
promised. 

TNSTEAD of taking a bus, 
Frelaine walked to his apartment. He wanted time to cool 



40 




 



off. There was no sense in acting 
like a kid on his first kill. 

As he walked, Rrelaine kept his 
eyes strictly to the front. Staring 
at anyone was practically asking 
for a bullet, if the man happened 
to be serving as Victim. Some 
Victims shot if you just glanced 
at them. Nervous fellows. Frelaine prudently looked above the 
heads of the people he passed. 

Ahead of him was a huge billboard, offering J. F. O'Donovan's 
services to the public. 

"Victims!" the sign proclaimed 
in huge red letters. "Why take 
chances? Use an O'Donovan accredited Spotter. Let us locate 
your assigned killer. Pay after 
you get him!" 

The sign reminded Frelaine. 
He would call Morrow as soon as 
he reached his apartment. 

He crossed the street, quickening his stride. He could hardly 
wait to get home now, to open 
the envelope and discover who his 
victim was. Would he be clever 
or stupid? Rich, like Frelaine's 
fourth Victim, or poor, like the 
first and second? Would he have 
an organized Spotter service, or 
try to go it on his own? 

The excitement of the chase 
was wonderful, coursing through 
his veins, quickening his heartbeat. From a block or so away, 
he heard gunfire. Two quick 
shots, and then a final one. 

Somebody got his man, Fre


laine thought. Good for him. 

It was a superb feeling, he told 
himself. He was alive again. 

AT his one-room apartment, 
the first thing Frelaine did 
was call Ed Morrow, his spotter. 
The man worked as a garage attendant between calls. 
"Hello, Ed? Frelaine." 
"Oh, hi, Mr. Frelaine." He 
could see the man's thin, greasestained face, grinning fiat-lipped 
at the telephone. 

"I'm going out on one, Ed." 
"Good luck, Mr. Frelaine," Ed 
Morrow said. "I. suppose you'll 
want me to stand by?" 

"That's right. I don't expect to 
be gone more than a week or two. 
I'll probably get my notification 
of Victim Status within three 
months of the kill." 

"I'll be standing by. Good 
hunting, Mr. Frelaine." 

"Thanks. So long." He hung 
up. It was a wise safety measure 
to reserve a first-class spotter. 
After his kill, it would be Frelaine's turn as Victim. Then, 
once again, Ed Morrow would be 
his life insurance. 

And what a marvelous spotter 
Morrow was! Uneducated — stupid, really. But what an eye for 
people! Morrow was a natural. 
His pale eyes could tell an outof-towner at a glance. He was 
diabolically clever at rigging an 
ambush. An indispensable man. 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



41 



Frelaine took out the envelope, 
chuckling to himself, remembering some of the tricks Morrow 
had turned for the Hunters. Still 
smiling, he glanced at the data 
inside the envelope. 

Janet-Marie Patzig. . 

His Victim was a female! 

Frelaine stood up and paced 
for a few moments. Then he read 
the letter again. Janet-Marie Patzig. No mistake. A girl. Three 
photographs were enclosed, her 
address, and the usual descriptive 
data. 

Frelaine frowned. He had never 
killed a female. 

He hesitated for a moment, 
then picked up the telephone and 
dialed. 

"Emotional Catharsis Bureau, 
Information Section," a man's 
voice answered. ' 

"Say, look," Frelaine said. "I 
just got my notification and I 
pulled a girl. Is that in order?" 
He gave the clerk the girl's name. 

"It's all in order, sir," the 
clerk replied after a minute of 
checking micro-files. "The girl 
registered with the board under 
her own free will. The law says 
she has the same rights and privileges as a man." 

"Could you tell me how many 
kills she has?" 

"I'm sorry, sir. The only information you're allowed is the 
victim's legal status and the descriptive data you have received." 



"I see." Frelaine paused. 
"Could I draw another?" 

"You can refuse the hunt, of 
course. That is your legal right. 
But you will not be allowed another Victim until you have 
served. Do you wish to refuse?" 

"Oh, no," Frelaine said hastily. 
"I was just wondering. Thank 
you." 

TTE hung up and sat down in 
his largest armchair, loosening his belt. This required some 
thought. 

Damn women, he grumbled to 
himself, always trying to horn in 
on a man's game. Why can't they 
stay home? 

But they were free citizens, he 
reminded himself. Still, it just 
didn't .seem feminine. 

He knew that, historically 
speaking, the Emotional Catharsis Board had been established 
for men and men only. The board 
had been* formed at the end of 
the fourth world war — or sixth, 
as some historians counted it. 

At that time there had been a 
driving need for permanent, lasting peace. The reason was practical, as were the men who 
engineered it. 

Simply — annihilation was just 
around the corner. 

In the world wars, weapons 
increased in magnitude, efficiency 
and exterminating power. Soldiers became accustomed to 



42 




 



them, less and less reluctant to 
use them. 

But the saturation point had 
been reached. Another war would 
truly be the war to end all wars. 
There would be no one left to 
start another. 

So this peace had to last for 
all time, but the men who engineered it were practical. They 
recognized the tensions and dislocations still present, the cauldrons in which wars are brewed. 
They asked themselves why 
peace had never lasted in the 
past. 

"Because men like to fight," 
was their answer. 

"Oh, no!" screamed the idealists. 

But the jnen who engineered 
the peace were forced to postulate, regretfully, the presence of 
a need for violence in a large 
percentage of mankind. 

Men aren't angels. They, aren't 
fiends, either. They are just very 
human beings, with a high degree 
of combativeness. 

With the scientific knowledge 
and the power they had at that 
moment, the practical men could 
have gone a long way toward 
breeding this trait out of the race. 
Many thought this was the answer. 

The practical men didn't. They 
recognized the validity of competition, love of battle, strength in 
the face of overwhelming odds. 



These, they felt, were admirable 
traits for a race, and insurance 
toward its ' perpetuity. Without 
them, the race would be bound to 
retrogress. 

The tendency toward violence, 
they found, was inextricably 
linked with ingenuity, flexibility, 
drive. 

The problem, then: To arrange 
a peace that would last after they 
were gone. To stop the race from 
destroying itself, without removing the responsible traits. 

The way to do this, they decided, was to rechannel Man's 
violence. 

Provide him with an outlet, 
an expression. 

The first big step was the legalization of gladiatorial events, 
complete with blood and thunder. 
But more was needed. Sublimations worked only up to a point. 
Then people demanded the real 
thing. 

There is no substitute for murder. 

CJO murder was legalized, on a 
^strictly individual basis, and 
only for those who wanted it. 
The governments were directed 
to create Emotional Catharsis 
Boards. 

After a period of experimentation, uniform rules were adopted. 

Anyone who wanted to murder could sign up at the ECB. 
Giving certain data and assur


SEVENTH VICTIM

ances, he would be granted a 
Victim. 

Anyone who signed up to murder, under the government rules, 
had to take his turn a few months 
later as Victim — if he survived. 

That, in essence, was the setup. 
The individual could commit as 
many murders as he wanted. But 
between each, he had to be a Victim. If he successfully killed his 
Hunter, he could stop, or sign up 
for another murder. 

At the end of ten years, an 
estimated third of the world's 
civilized population had applied 
for at least one murder. The 
number slid to a fourth, and 
stayed there. 

Philosophers shook their heads, 
but the practical men were satisfied. War was where it belonged 
— in the hands of the individual. 

Of course, there were ramifications to the game, and elaborations. Once its existence had been 
accepted it became big business. 
There were services for Victim 
and Hunter alike. 

The Emotional Catharsis Board 
picked the Victims' names at random. A Hunter was allowed six 
months in which to make his kill. 
This had to be done by his own 
ingenuity, unaided. He was given 
the name of his Victim, address 
and description-, and allowed to 
use a standard caliber pistol. He 
could wear no armor of any sort. 

The Victim was notified a week 



before the Hunter. He was told 
only that he was a Victim. He 
did not know the name of his 
Hunter. He was allowed his 
choice of armor, however. He 
could hire spotters. A spotter 
couldn't kill; only Victim and 
Hunter could do that. But he 
could detect a stranger in town, 
or ferret out a nervous gunman. 

The Victim could arrange any 
kind of ambush in his power to 
kill the Hunter. 

There were stiff penalties for 
killing or wounding the wrong 
man, for no other murder was 
allowed. Grudge killings and 
gain killings were punishable by 
death. 

The beauty of the system was 
that the people who. wanted to 
kill could do so. Those who didn't 
— the bulk of the population — 
didn't have to. 

At least, there weren't any more 
big wars. Not even the imminence of one. 

Just hundreds of thousands of 
small ones. 

T^RELAINE didn't especially 
•■- like the idea of killing a woman-; but she had signed up. It 
wasn't his fault. And he wasn't 
going to lose out on his seventh 
hunt. 

He spent the rest of the morning memorizing the data on his 
Victim, then filed the letter. 

Janet Patzig lived in New 



44 




 



York. That was good. He enjoyed 
hunting in a big city, and he had 
nlways wanted to see New York. 
Her age wasn't given, but to 
judge from her photographs, she 
was in her early twenties. 

Frelaine phoned for jet reservations to New York, then took 
a shower. He dressed with care 
in a new Protec-Suit Special 
made for the occasion. From his 
collection he selected a gun, 
cleaned and oiled it, and fitted it 
into the fling-out pocket of the 
suit. Then he packed his suitcase. 

A pulse of excitement was 
pounding in his veins. Strange, 
he thought, how each killing was 
a new excitement. It was something you just didn't tire of, the 
way you did of French pastry or 
women or drinking or anything 
else. It was always new and different. 

Finally, he looked over his 
books to see which he would take. 

His library contained all the 
good books on the subject. He 
wouldn't need any of his Victim 
books, like L. Fred Tracy's Tactics for the Victim, with its insistence on a rigidly controlled 
environment, or Dr. Frisch's 
Don'r Think Like a Victim! 

He would be very interested in 
those in a few months, when he 
was a Victim again. Now he 
wanted hunting books. 

Tactics for Hunting Humans 

SEVENTH VICTIM 



was the standard and definitive 
work, but he had it almost memorized. Development of the Ambush was not adapted to his 
present needs. 

He chose Hunting in Cities, by 
Mitwell and Clark, Spotting the 
Spotter, by Algreen, and The 
Victim's Ingroup, by the same 
author. 

Everything was in order. He 
left a note for the milkman, 
locked his apartment and took a 
cab to the airport. 

TN New York, he checked into 
■* a hotel in the midtown area, 
not too far from his Victim's 
address. The clerks were smiling 
and attentive, which bothered 
Frelaine. He didn't like to be 
recognized so easily as an outof-town killer. 

The first thing he saw in his 
room was a pamphlet on his bedtable. How to Get the Most out 
of your Emotional Catharsis, it 
was called, with the compliments 
of the management. Frelaine 
smiled and thumbed through it. 

Since it was his first visit to 
New York, Frelaine spent the 
afternoon just walking the 
streets in his Victim's neighborhood. After that, he wandered 
through a few stores. 

Martinson and Black was a 
fascinating place. He went 
through their Hunter -Hunted 
room. There were lightweight 

45 



bulletproof vests for Victims, and 
Richard Arlington hats, with bulletproof crowns. 

On one side was a large display of a new .38 caliber sidearm. 

"Use the Malvern Strait-shot!" 
the ad proclaimed. "ECB-approved. Carries a load of twelve 
shots. Tested deviation less than 
.001 inch per 1000 feet. Don't 
miss your Victim! Don't risk 
your life without the best! Be 
safe with Malvern!" 

Frelaine smiled. The ad was 
good, and the small black weapon looked ultimately efficient. 
But he was satisfied with the one 
he had. 

There was a special sale on 
trick canes, with concealed fourshot magazine, promising safety 
and concealment. As a young 
man, Frelaine had gone in heavily 
for novelties. But now he knew 
that the old-fashioned ways were 
usually the best. 

Outside the store, four men 
from the Department of Sanitation were carting away a freshly 
killed corpse. Frelaine regretted 
missing the kill. 

He ate dinner in a good restaurant and went to bed early. 

Tomorrow he had a lot to do. 

The next day, with the face 
of his Victim before him, Frelaine walked through her neighborhood. He didn't look closely 
at anyone. Instead, he moved 



rapidly, as though he were really 
going somewhere, the way an old 
Hunter should walk. 

He passed several bars and 
dropped into one for a drink. 
Then he went on, down a side 
street off Lexington Avenue. 

There was a pleasant sidewalk 
cafe there. Frelaine walked past 
it. 

And there she was! He could 
never mistake the face. It was 
Janet Patzig, seated at a table, 
staring into a drink. She didn't 
look up as he passed. 

T^RELAINE walked to the end 
■■■ of the block. He turned the 
corner and stopped, hands trembling. 

Was the girl crazy, exposing 
herself in the open? Did she think 
she had a charmed life? 

He hailed a taxi and had the 
man drive around the block. 
Sure enough, she was just sitting 
there. Frelaine took a careful 
look. 

She seemed younger than her 
pictures, but he couldn't be sure. 
He would guess her to be not 
much over twenty. Her dark 
hair was parted in the middle 
and combed above her ears, giving her a nunlike appearance. 
Her expression, as far as Frelaine 
could tell, was one of resigned 
sadness. 

Wasn't she even going to make 
an attempt to defend herself? 



46 




 



Frelaine paid the driver and 
hurried to a drugstore. Finding 
a vacant telephone booth, he 
called ECB. 

"Are you sure that a Victim 
named Janet-Marie Patzig has 
been notified?" 

"Hold on, sir." Frelaine tapped 
on the door while the clerk looked 
up the information. "Yes, sir. We 
have her personal confirmation. 
Is there anything wrong, sir?" 

"No," Frelaine said. "Just 
wanted to check." 

After, all, it was no one's business if the girl didn't want to 
defend herself. 

He was still entitled to kill 
her. 

It was his turn. 

He postponed it for that day, 
however, and went to a movie. 
After dinner, he returned to his 
room and read the ECB pamphlet. Then he lay on his bed and 
glared at the ceiling. 

All he had to do was pump a 
bullet into her. Just ride by in a 
cab and kill her. 

She was being a very bad sport 
about it, he decided resentfully, 
and went to sleep. 

npHE next afternoon, Frelaine 
walked by the cafe again. The 
girl was back, sitting at the same 
table. Frelaine caught a cab. 

"Drive around the block very 
slowly 5 " he told the driver. 

"Sure," the driver said, grin


ning with sardonic wisdom. 

From the cab, Frelaine watched 
for spotters. As far as he could 
tell, the girl had none. Both her 
hands were in sight upon the 
table. 

An easy, stationary target. 

Frelaine touched the button of 
his double-breasted jacket. A fold 
flew open and the gun was in 
his hand. He broke it open and 
checked the cartridges, then 
closed it with a snap. 

"Slowly, now," he told the 
driver. 

The taxi crawled by the cafe. 
Frelaine took careful aim, centering the girl in his sights. His 
finger tightened, on the trigger. 

"Damn it!" he said. 

A waiter had passed by the 
girl. He didn't want to chance 
winging someone else. 

"Around the block again," he 
told the driver. 

The man gave him another 
grin and hunched down in his 
seat. Frelaine wondered if the 
driver would feel so happy if he v 
knew that Frelaine was gunning 
for a woman. 

This time there was no waiter 
around. The girl was lighting a 
cigarette, her mournful face intent on her lighter. Frelaine centered her in his sights, squarely 
above the eyes, and held h\s r 
breath. 

Then he shook his head and 
put the gun back in his pocket. 



SEVENTH VICTIM 



47 



The idiotic girl was robbing him 
of the full benefit of his catharsis. 

He paid the driver and started 
to walk. 

It's too easy, he told himself. 
He was used to a real chase. Most 
of the other six kills had been 
quite difficult. The Victims had 
tried every dodge. One had hired 
at least, a dozen spotters. But 
Frelaine had gotten to them all 
by altering his tactics to meet the 
situation. 

Once he had dressed as a milkman, another time as a bill collector. The sixth Victim he had 
had to chase through the Sierra 
Nevadas. The man had clipped 
him, too. But Frelaine had done 
better than that. 

How could he be proud of this 
one? What would the Tens Club 
say? 

That brought Frelaine up with 
a start. He wanted to get into the 
club. Even if he passed up this 
girl, he would have to defend 
himself against a Hunter. Surviving that, he would still be four 
hunts away from membership. Atthat rate, he might never get in. 

TTE began to pass the cafe 
again, then, on impulse, stopped abruptly. 

"Hello," he said. 
t Janet Patzig looked at him out 
of sad blue eyes, but said nothing. 

"Say, look," he said, sitting 



down. "If I'm being fresh, just 
tell me and I'll go. I'm an out-oftowner. Here on a convention. 
And I'd just like someone feminine to talk to. If you'd rather 
I didn't—" 

"I don't care," Janet Patzig 
said tonelessly. 

"A brandy," Frelaine told the 
waiter. Janet Patzig's glass was 
still half full. 

Frelaine looked at the girl and 
he could feel his heart throbbing 
against his ribs. This was more 
like it — having a drink with your 
Victim! 

"My name's Stanton Frelaine," he said, knowing it didn't 
matter. 

"Janet." 

"Janet what?" 

"Janet Patzig." 

"Nice to know you," Frelaine 
said, in a perfectly natural voice. 
"Are you doing anything tonight, 
Janet?" 

"I'm probably being killed tonight," she said quietly. 

Frelaine looked at her carefully. Did she realize who he was? 
For all he knew, she had a gun 
leveled at him under the table. 

He kept his hand close to the 
fling-out button. 

"Are you a Victim?" he asked. 

"You guessed it," she said sardonically. "If I were you, I'd stay 
out of the way. No sense getting 
hit by mistake." 

Frelaine couldn't understand 



48 




 



the girl's calm. Was she a suicide? Perhaps she just didn't 
care. Perhaps she wanted to die. 

"Haven't you got any spotters?" he asked, with the right 
expression of amazement. 

"No." She looked at him, full 
in the face, and Frelaine saw 
something he hadn't noticed before. 

She was very lovely. 

"I am a bad, bad girl," she 
said lightly. "I got the idea I'd 
like to commit a murder, so I 
signed for ECB. Then — I couldn't 
do it." 




RELAINE shook his head, 
sympathizing with her. 



"But I'm still in, of course. 
Even if I didn't shoot, I still have 
to be a Victim." 

"But why don't you hire some 
spotters?" he asked. 

"I couldn't kill anyone," she 
said. "I just couldn't. I don't even 
have a gun." 

"You've got a lot of courage," 
Frelaine said, "coming out in the 
open this way." Secretly, he was 
amazed at her stupidity. 

"What can I do?" she asked 
listlessly. "You can't hide from a 
Hunter. Not a real one. And I 
don't have enough money to 
make a real disappearance." 

"Since it's in your own defense, 
I should think — " Frelaine began, 
but she interrupted. 

"No. I've made up my mind 

SEVENTH VICTIM 



on that. This whole thing is 
wrong, the whole system. When 
I had my Victim in the sights — 
when I saw how easily I could — 
I could—" 

She pulled herself together 
quickly. 

"Oh, let's forget it," she said, 
and smiled. 

Frelaine found her smile dazzling. 

After that, they talked of other 
things. Frelaine told her of his 
business, and she told him about 
New York. She was twenty-two, 
an unsuccessful actress. 

They had supper together. 
When she accepted Frelaine's 
invitation to go to the Gladiatorials, he felt absurdly elated. 

He called a cab — he seemed to 
be spending his entire time in 
New York in cabs — and opened 
the door for her. She started in. 
Frelaine hesitated. He could have 
pumped a shot into her at that 
moment. It would have been very 
easy. 

But he held his hand. Just for 
the moment, he told himself. 

ITHHE Gladiatorials were about 
the same as those held anywhere else, except that the talent 
was a little better. There were the 
usual historical events, swordsmen and netmen, duels with saber 
and foil. 

Most of these, naturally, were 
fought to the death.

Then bull fighting, lion fighting and rhino fighting, followed 
by the more modern events. 
Fights from behind barricades 
with bow and arrow. Dueling on 
a high wire. 

The evening passed pleasantly. 

Frelaine escorted the girl home, 
the palms of his hands sticky with 
sweat. He had never found a woman he liked better. And yet she 
was his legitimate kill. 

He didn't know what he was 
going to do. 

She invited him in and they 
sat together on the couch. The 
girl lighted a cigarette for herself 
with a large lighter, then settled 
back. 

"Are you leaving soon?" she 
asked him. 

"I suppose so," Frelaine said. 
"The convention is only lasting 
another day." 

She was silent for a moment. 
"I'll be sorjjr to see you go. Send 
roses to my funeral." 

They were quiet for a while. 
Then Janet went to fix him a 
drink. Frelaine eyed her retreating back. Now was the time. He 
placed his hand near the button. 

But the moment had passed for 
him, irrevocably. He wasn't going to kill her. You don't kill the 
girl you love. 

The realization that he loved 
her was shocking. He'd come to 
kill, not to find a wife. 

She came back with the drink 



and sat down opposite him, staring at emptiness. 

"Janet," he said. "I love you." 

She sat, just looking at him. 
There were tears in her eyes. 

"You can't," she protested 
"I'm a Victim. I won't live long 
enough to — " 

"You won't be killed. I'm your 
Hunter." 

She stared at him a moment, 
then laughed uncertainly. 

"Are you going to kill me?" she 
asked. 

"Don't be ridiculous," he said. 
"I'm going to marry you." 

Suddenly she was in his arms. 

"Oh, Lord!" she gasped. "The 
waiting — I've been so frightened — " 

"It's all over," he told her. 
"Think what a story it'll make 
for our kids. How I came to murder you and left marrying you." 

She kissed him, then sat back 
and lighted another cigarette. 

"Let's start packing," Frelaine 
said. "I want — " 

"Wait," Janet interrupted. 
"You haven't asked if I love you." 

"What?" 

She was still smiling, and the 
cigarette lighter was pointed at 
him. In the bottom of it was a 
black hole. A hole just large 
enough for a .38 caliber bullet. 

"Don't kid arpund," he objected, getting to his feet. 

"I'm not being funny, darling," 
she said.

TN a fraction of a second, Frelaine had time to wonder how 
he could ever have thought she 
was not much over twenty. Looking at her now — really looking at 
her — he knew she couldn't be 
much less than thirty. Every 
minute of her strained, tense existence showed on her face. 

"I don't love you, Stanton," 
she said very softly, the cigarette 
lighter poised. 

Frelaine struggled for breath. 
One part of him was able to 
realize detachedly what a mar


velous actress she really was. She 
must have known all along. 

Frelaine pushed the button, 
and the gun was in his hand, 
cocked and ready. 

The blow that struck him in 
the chest knocked him over a 
coffee table. The gun fell out of 
his hand. Gasping, half -conscious, 
he watched her take careful aim 
for the coup de grace. 

"Now I can join the Tens," he 
heard her say elatedly as she 
squeezed the trigger.
