ON page 258 of The Family 
Book of Humor, edited by 
Helen Hoke and published by 
Hanover House, is an item called 
"Look Now"— two Galaxy edito- 
rials combined into one alarmingly 
funny article. You probably read 
it here, so I'm only incidentally 
pointing with pride. What I really 
want to do is exhibit some samples 
from this rich godown you might 
otherwise not get around to explor- 
ing. 

"Doctor Doll" by Inez Robb 
unwraps a porcelain patient with 
removable viscera: "Once the 
tiny tykes have scrubbed up and 
sterilized their hands and instru- 
ments, they put this doll or ca- 
daver on the operating table, ad- 
minister an anaesthetic and open 
up the torso by removing laces that 
look like sutures. 

"One peek inside the yawning 
cavity gives the in-training Flor- 
ence Nightingale a lovely look at 
the small and large intestines, liver, 
heart, kidneys, appendix, stomach 
and lungs, but not necessarily in 
that order . . . 

"Dolly's vital organs are made 
of plastic and are suspended on 
pegs for easy removal and return. 
Squeamish as I am, I must con- 
fess that this is an improvement 
over the original model, and Na- 



ture could do worse than take 
note ..." 

"The Flea Position" by John 
Crosby reveals that Billy Rayner, 
British flea impresario, advertised 
unsuccessfully for 12 fleas and 
gave this glum interview to the 
Daily Telegraph: 

"Since the war the flea position 
has been getting steadily worse. I 
blame the vacuum cleaners and 
these newfangled disinfectants. The 
average flea lives only for about 
three months, and they do not 
breed in captivity. Toward the 
end of three months they become 
stiff-jointed, just like humans in 
their old age. And then they can- 
not ride the cycles, pull chariots 
or do sword fighting. All the old 
fleas can manage is an occasional 
dance. The public won't pay to 
see that. It is just what they ex- 
pect from fleas, anyway." 

Mr. Rayner then offers a spring- 
board for an extrapolation that has 
unaccountably been overlooked by 
science fiction writers: "We usual- 
ly find that the more educated 
people are, the more interest they 
take in our fleas. At Oxford we 
bring the house down."

NEVER 
COME MIDNIGHT 

by CHRISTOPHER GRIMM 

Across the void came a man who could not ever 
have been born — from a world that could never 
have been conceived — to demand his birthright 
of an Earth that would have to die to pay it! 

Illustrated by DILLON 



JAN SHORTMIRE smiled. 
"You didn't know I had a 
son, did you, Peter? Well, 
neither did I— until quite recently." 
"I see." However, Peter Hub- 
bard knew that Jan Shortmire had 
never married in all of his hundred 
and fifty-five years. In that day and 
age, unmarried people did not have 
children; science, the law, and pub- 
lic sophistication had combined to 
make the historical "accident" al- 
most impossible. Yet, if some wom- 
an of one of the more innocent 



planets had deliberately conceived 
in order to trap Shortmire, surely 
he would have learned of his son's 
existence long before. 

"I'm glad it turns out that I 
have an heir," Shortmire went on. 
"Otherwise, the government might 
get its fists on what little I have— 
and it's taken enough from me." 

Although the old man's estate 
was a considerable one, it did seem 
meager in terms of the money he 
must have made. What had be- 
come of the golden tide that had 




 




NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 





poured in upon the golden youth, 
Hubbard wondered. Could anyone 
have squandered such prodigious 
sums upon the usual mundane dis- 
sipations? For, by the time the 
esoteric pleasures of the other 
planets had reached Earth — the 
byproduct of Shortmire's own 
achievement — he must have al- 
ready been too old to enjoy them. 

At Hubbard's continued silence, 
Shortmire said defensively, "If 
they'd let me sell my patents to 
private industry, as Dyall was able 
to do, I'd be leaving a real for- 
tune!" His voice grew thick with 
anger. "When I think how much 
money Dyall made from those 
factory machines of his . . . " 

But when you added the price- 
less extra fifty years of life to the 
money Shortmire had made, it 
seemed to Hubbard that Shortmire 
had been amply rewarded. Al- 
though, of course, he had heard 
that Nicholas Dyall had been 
given the same reward. No point 
telling Shortmire, if he did not 
know already. Hubbard could 
never understand why Shortmire 
hated Dyall so; it could not be 
merely the money— and as for repu- 
tation, he had a shade the advan- 
tage. 

"That toymaker!" Shortmire 
spat. 

TTUBBARD tactfully changed 
-*--■- the subject. "What's your boy 
like, Jan?" But of course Jan 



Shortmire's son could hardly be a 
boy; in fact, he was probably al- 
most as old as Hubbard was. 

Such old age as Shortmire's was 
almost incredible. Sitting there in 
the antique splendor of Hubbard's 
office, he looked like a splendid 
antique himself. Who could 
imagine that passion had ever con- 
vulsed that thin white face, that 
those frail white fingers had ever 
curved in love and in hate? Age 
beyond the reach of most men had 
blanched this once-passionate man 
to a chill, ivory shadow. 

For once, Hubbard felt glad — 
almost — that he himself was in- 
eligible for the longevity treatment. 
The alloted five score and ten was 
enough for any except the very 
selfish— or selfless— man. 

But Shortmire was answering 
his question. "I have no idea what 
the boy is like; I've never seen 
him." Then he added, "I suppose 
you've been wondering why I fi- 
nally decided to make a will?" 

"A lawyer never wonders when 
people do make wills, Jan," Hub- 
bard said mildly. "He wonders 
when they don't." 

"I'm going on a trip to Morethis. 
Only one of the colonized planets 
I've never visited." Shortmire's 
smile did not reach his amber-hard 
eyes. "Civilized planets, I should 
have said. It isn't official govern- 
ment policy to colonize planets 
that have intelligent native live- 
forms." 




 



Not even the most besotted 
idealist could ever have described 
Jan Shortmire as altruistic. And 
for him to be concerned about 
Morethis, of all planets-Morethis, 
where the indigenous life-forms 
were such as to justify a ruthless 
colonization policy ... it was 
outrageous! True, the terrestrial 
government had been more gen- 
erous toward the Morethans than 
toward any of the seven other in- 
telligent life-forms they had found. 
But this tolerance was based 
wholly on fear — fear of these rem- 
nants of an old, old civilization, 
eking out their existence around a 
dying star, yet with terrible glories 
to remember in their twilight— and 
traces of these glories to protect 
them. 

How was it that Shortmire, who 
had been everywhere, seen every- 
thing, had never been to More- 
this? Hubbard looked keenly at his 
client. "What is all this, Jan?" 

The old man shrueged. "Mere- 
ly that the Foreign Office has sug- 
gested it would be wise for trav- 
elers to make a will before going 
there. Being a dutiful citizen of 
Earth, I comply." He smiled bale- 
fully. 

"The Foreign Office has sug- 
gested that it would be wiser not 
to go at all," Hubbard said. "There 
are people who say Morethis ought 
to be fumigated completely." 

"Ah, but it has rare and precious 
metals on which our industries de- 



pend. There are herbs which have 
multiplied the miracles of mod- 
ern medicine, jewels and furs un- 
matched anywhere. We need the 
native miners and farmers and 
trappers to get these things for us." 

"We could get them for our- 
selves. We do on the other planets." 

Shortmire grinned. "On More- 
this, somehow, our people can't 
seem to find these things them- 
selves. Or, if they do, we can't find 
our people afterward. Which is 
why there is peace and friendship 
between Morethis and Earth." 

"Friendship! Everyone knows 
the Morethans hate terrestrials. 
They tolerate us only because 
we're stronger!" 

"Stronger physically." Short- 
mire's smile was fading. "Even 
technology is a kind of physical 
strength." 

jV"EW apprehension took shape 
in Hubbard. "You're not go- 
ing metaphysical in your old age, 
are you, Jan? And even if you 
are," he said quickly, while he 
was still innocent of knowledge, 
hence could not be consciously of- 
fending the other man's beliefs, 
"what a cult to choose! Blood, ter- 
ror and torture!" 

Shortmire grinned again. "You've 
been watching vidicasts, Peter. 
They've laid it on so thick, I'll 
probably find Morethis deadly dull 
rather than just . . . deadly." 

Certainly, all Hubbard knew of 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 







Morethis was based on hearsay 
evidence, but this was not a court 
of law. "Jan you're a fool! A third 
of the terrestrials who go to More- 
this never come back, and mostly 
they're young men, strong men." 

"Then they're the fools." Short- 
mire's voice was low and tired. 
"Because they're risking a whole 
lifetime, whereas all I'll be risk- 
ing is a few years of a very boring 
existence." 

Hubbard said no more. Even 
though the law still did not con- 
done it, a man had the right to dis- 
pose of his own life as he saw fit. 

Shortmire stood up. Barely 
stooped by age, he looked, with his 
great height and extreme emacia- 
tion, almost like a fasting saint — 
a ludicrous simile. "My wine palate 
is gone, Peter," he said, clapping 
the younger old man's shoulder, 
"women and I seem to have lost 
our mutual attraction, and I never 
did have much of a singing voice. 
At least this is one experience I'm 
not too old to savor." 

"Death, do you mean?" Hub- 
bard asked bluntly. "Or More- 
this?" 

Shortmire smiled. "Perhaps 
both." 

So Peter Hubbard was not sur- 
prised when, a few months later, 
he got word that Jan Shortmire 
had died on Morethis. The sur- 
prising thing was the extraordi- 
narily prosaic manner of his death : 
he had simply fallen into a river 



and drowned. No traveler on 
Morethis had been known to die 
by undisputed accident before; as 
a result, the vidicasts devoted more 
attention to the event than they 
might have otherwise. But the news 
died down, as other news took its 
place. In so large a universe, some- 
thing was always happening; the 
dog days were forever gone from 
journalism. 

Going through the old man's 
papers in his capacity as executor, 
Hubbard came across an old pass- 
port. He was startled to discover 
that this trip had not been Short- 
mire's first to Morethis. Why had 
he lied about it? But that was a 
question that no one alive could 
answer — or so Hubbard thought. 

Almost two years went by be- 
fore the will was finally probated 
on all the planets where Short- 
mire had owned property. Then 
the search for Emrys Shortmire 
began. Messages were dispatched 
to all the civilized planets, and 
Peter Hubbard settled back for a 
long wait. 

FIVE years after Jan Short- 
mire's death, the intercom on 
Peter Hubbard's desk buzzed and 
his secretary's voice — his was one 
of the few legal offices wealthy 
enough to afford human help — 
said, "Mr. Emrys Shortmire to 
see you, sir." 

How could a man come from so 
many light-years' distance without 


 



radioing on ahead, or at least tele- 
calling from his hotel? Dignity de- 
manded that Hubbard tell his sec- 
retary to inform Shortmire that he 
never saw anyone without an ap- 
pointment. Curiosity won. "Ask 
him to come in," he said. 

The door slid open. Hubbard 
started to rise, with the old-fash- 
ioned courtesy of a family lawyer. 
But he never made it. He sat, 
frozen with shock, staring at the 
man in the doorway. Because Em- 
rys Shortmire wasn't a man; he 
was a boy. He might have been a 
stripling of thirty, except for his 
eyes. Copper-bright and copper- 
hard they were, too hard for a 
boy's. Give him forty, even forty- 
five, that would still have made Jan 
Shortmire a father when he was 
nearly a hundred and twenty. The 
longevity treatment produced re- 
markable results, but none that fan- 
tastic. Though health and strength 
could be restored, fertility, like 
youth, once vanished was gone for- 
ever. 

Yet the boy looked too sophis- 
ticated to have made a stupid mis- 
take like that, if he were an im- 
poster. More important, he looked 
like Jan Shortmire— not the Short- 
mire whom Hubbard had known, 
but the broad-shouldered youth of 
the early pictures, golden of hair 
and skin and eyes, almost classical 
in feature and build. Plastic sur- 
gery could have converted a fleet- 
ing resemblance to a precise one, 



yet, somehow, Hubbard felt that 
this was flesh and blood of the old 
man's. 

"You're very like your father," 
he said, inaccurately: Emrys was 
less like his father than he should 
have been, given that startling 
identity of physique. 

"Am I?" The boy smiled. "I 
never knew him. Of course, I 
know I look like the pictures, but 
pictures never tell much, do they?" 

He had many papers to give 
Peter Hubbard. Too many; no 
honest man had his life so well in 
order. But then Emrys' honesty 
was not the issue, only his identity. 
The birth certificate said he had 
been born on Clergal fifty-five 
years before, so he was ten years 
older than Hubbard's wildest es- 
timate. A young man, but not a 
boy — a man of full maturity, but 
still too young to be, normally, Jan 
Shortmire's son. Then Hubbard 
opened Emrys Shortmire's pass- 
port and received another shock. 

He tried to sound calm. "I see 
you were on Morethis the same 
time your father was!" 

Emrys' smile widened. "Curious 
coincidence, wasn't it?" 

A surge of almost physical dis- 
like filled the lawyer. "Is that all 
it was — a coincidence?" 

"Are you suggesting that I 
pushed my father into the Ekkan?" 
Emrys asked pleasantly. 

"Certainly not!" Hubbard was 
indignant at the thought that he, 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



11 




as a lawyer, would have voiced 
such a suspicion, even if it had 
occurred to him. "I thought you 
two might have arranged to meet 
on Morethis." 

"I told you I'd never seen my 
father," Emrys reminded him. "As 
for what I was doing on Morethis 
— that's my business." 

"All I'm concerned with is 
whether or not you are Emrys 
Shortmire." Distaste was almost 
tangible on Hubbard's tongue. "It 
does seem surprising that, since 
you were on Morethis at the time 
your father died, you should not 
have come to claim your inheri- 
tance sooner." 

"I had affairs of my own to 
wind up," Emrys said flatly. 

HUBBARD tapped the papers. 
"You understand that these 
must be checked before you re- 
ceive your father's estate?" 

"I understand perfectly." Emrys' 
voice was soft as a Si-yllan cat- 
man's, and even more insulting. 
"They will be gone over thorough- 
ly for any possible error, any tiny 
imperfection, anything that could 
invalidate my claim. But you will 
find them entirely in order." 

"I'm sure of that." And Hub- 
bard knew, if the papers were for- 
geries, they would be works of 
art. 

"You'll probably want me to 
undergo an equally thorough phys- 
ical examination for signs of — ah 



— surgical tampering. Yes, I see 
I'm right." 

Ungenerous hope leaped inside 
Hubbard. "You would object?" 

"On the contrary, I'd be de- 
lighted. Haven't had a thorough 
medical checkup for years." On this 
cooperative note, Emrys Short- 
mire bowed and left. 

Hubbard sighed back against the 
velvet cushions of his chair — real 
silk, for he was a very rich old 
man. Unfortunately, he could not 
doubt that this was Jan Short- 
mire's progeny. But — and Hub- 
bard sat upright — no matter how 
much Emrys resembled his father, 
that was only one parent. Who 
had the young man's mother been? 

Quickly, Hubbard searched 
through the papers for the birth 
certificate. The name was Iloa 
Tasqi. The nationality: Morethan. 

No wonder the affair had been 
kept so secret. No wonder Emrys 
seemed so strange and that Jan had 
lied about his previous visit to the 
dark planet. Small wonder, too, 
that he'd had a son he was not 
aware of. Who would have be- 
lieved that human and Morethan 
could breed together? For the 
Morethans, although humanoid, 
were not at all human. 

So Emrys Shortmire was only 
half human. The other half was — 
well, the vidicasts called it monster, 
and, now that he had met the 
young man, Peter Hubbard was 
inclined to agree.

/"\UTSIDE the office building, 
^^ Emrys Shortmire paused and 
inhaled deeply. Say what you 
would about the atmospheres of 
some of the other planets' being 
fresher and purer, the air of Earth, 
being the air in which Man had 
evolved, was the air that felt best 
in his nostrils and filled his lungs 
to greatest satisfaction. And, after 
the fetid atmosphere of Morethis, 
this was pure heaven. Gray sky 
and violet dying sun against blue 
sky and radiant golden sun. No 
wonder the Morethans were what 
they were, and Earthmen were 
what they were. 

Well, the golden sun of Earth 
would set somewhat sooner than 
the physicists — or the sociologists 
— had prognosticated. But all that 
would be long after he himself had 
died. It was no concern of his, 
anyway. He was Emrys Shortmire, 
born out of Jan Shortmire and 
no mortal woman; and nothing 
else on Earth, or in the Universe, 
mattered. 

Disdaining the importunate heli- 
cabs that besieged him with plain- 
tive mechanical offers of transpor- 
tation, he walked down the street, 
enjoying the pull of the planet 
upon the youth and strength of his 
body, delighting in the clarity of 
his vision and the keenness of his 
nostrils. He was so absorbed in 
his thoughts and so unaccustomed 



still to Earth's traffic that he did 
not look where he was going. The 
groundcar was upon him before he 
knew it. Of course something like 
this would happen, he thought bit- 
terly, as darkness descended upon 
him and he waited for the crush- 
ing impact. It was always like that 
in the old stories, always some 
drawback to spoil the magic gift 

But then it was light again. The 
car had passed over him and he 
was unharmed, to the amazement 
— and disappointment — of the 
avid crowd that had gathered. 

"Pedestrians should look where 
they're going," the voice of the car 
observed petulantly. "Repairs cost 
money." 

Being part human, Emrys was 
shaken by the experience. His eye 
caught the brilliant sign of a bar. 
Here, he thought, would be syrup 
to soothe his nerves. And he went 
inside, eager to try the taste of 
ancient vintages of Earth — unob- 
tainable on the other planets, since 
fine wines and liquors could not 
endure the journey through space. 

TTE sipped a whisky and soda, 
■*•-■- trying not to feel disap- 
pointed at the savor. As he drank, 
he felt eyes upon him — the bar- 
tender's. Yet the long Qesharakan 
reflecting glass above the bar 
showed him nothing unusual about 
his appearance. Did the bartender 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



13 



know who he was? How could he? 

Then Emrys noticed that the 
man glanced from him to someone 
else — a girl sitting at the other 
end of the bar. As she met Emrys' 
eye, she smiled at him. Absently, 
with remote appreciation of her 
good looks, he smiled back, then 
returned to the contemplation of 
his drink. The bartender's expres- 
sion deepened to amused contempt. 

Emrys realized what was wrong 
and he could hardly keep from 
laughing. So intent had he been 
on the pursuit of his goal that he 
had almost lost sight of the goal 
itself. Deliberately, he turned his 
head and smiled at the girl. She 
promptly smiled back. 

He sat down at her side. Now 
that he was close, her aquamarine 
hair showed dark at the roots, and, 
through the thick golden maquil- 
lage, the pores stood out on her 
nose. Also, she was not so very 
young. He laughed then, and, when 
she asked why, bought her a drink. 
After he had bought her several 
more, they went to her apartment 
— a luxurious one in a good section 
of town. She was not going to be 
cheap, but, he thought with rising 
anticipation, he could afford her. 

However, the night was curious- 
ly unsatisfactory. For him — ap- 
parently not for the girl, because 
the next morning she indignantly 
refused his money. Evidently the 
experience had been something out 

the ordinary for her. He could 



not feel it was her fault that it had 
been nothing for him; the lack was 
in him, he thought, some almost- 
felt emotion he could not recap- 
ture. 

Promising to call her, he left, 
went back to his hotel room and 
flung himself upon the resilient 
burim-moss couch. 

His body wasn't tired, but his 
head ached wearily. The liquor, 
naturally, on an empty stomach . . . 
after all those years of Morethan 
qumesht. And then the trip. Even 
with the Shortmire engines— stand- 
ard equipment now, of course — it 
had taken a long, tiring time, for 
Morethis was the most distant of 
all the civilized planets. Anyone 
would be exhausted after such a 
trip. Added to all this, the accident. 
There were no bruises on his body 
yet, but later, he knew, they would 
be visible. 

AT last he slept, or seemed to, 
and dreamed he was on More- 
this again — or Morethis was there 
with him. The air thickened about 
him into the tangible atmosphere 
of the dark planet — the swirling 
aniline fog that never cleared. And 
in the midst stood Uvrei, the high 
priest, robed in amethyst and sable. 
The term high priest was vulgar 
as applied to him, but the nearest 
terrestrial equivalent to what he 
was. 

The lips in the shockingly beau- 
tiful face parted. "How goes it, son 




 



of my spirit?" the familiar greeting 
rolled out, in the familiar voice, 
deep yet sweet, like dulcet thunder. 

"My head hurts, father of my 
soul." Emrys knew his voice was a 
petulant child's, yet he could not 
stop himself. "I was promised—" 

"You have not taken care," the 
ancient one said. 

How ancient he was, Emrys did 
not know. The priests of More- 
this were, they said, immortal. And 
they did live for a long, long 
time, far longer than the common 
people, whom they resembled only 
vaguely. Terrestrial scholars said 
the ruling class was a variant of 
the Morethan race, inbred to pre- 
serve its identity, probably closer 
to the original world-shaking More- 
thans than their debased followers. 
The members of this group seemed 
young, as coin faces seem young, 
also old, like coins themselves. 

"I warned you it takes time for 
the final adjustments to be made. 
Wait, my son; haste means nothing 
to you." 

"But IVe waited so long," Em- 
rys complained. 

"Wait a little longer, then. You 
have all the time in the world." 

The fog swirled shut about him, 
and Emrys sank into his personal 
miasma of sleep. When he woke 
up, late that afternoon, he knew 
from the dank odor clinging to the 
bedclothes that it had not been 
a dream, that the priests, the 
"gods," the "immortals" of More- 



this could, as they professed — and 
even he had not believed them in 
this — project their minds far 
through space . . . though, fortu- 
nately, not their bodies, or they 
would not have needed him. He 
remembered then the vial of tiny 
golden pellets Uvrei had given him 
before he left Morethis, and took 
one. Perhaps that was what the 
ancient one had meant. At any 
rate, Emrys thought he felt better 
afterward. 

He examined his body in the 
mirror to see if bruises had come, 
but the tawny, muscle-rippled flesh 
was unmarked. At length he put 
on his clothes and, leaving the 
hotel, went to a jeweler, where he 
bought a costly bracelet to be sent 
to the girl of the night before. Such 
a grandiose gesture relievecl him — 
he had always felt — of all further 
obligation. 

He did not wish to repeat his ex- 
perience with the liquor, so he did 
not go to a bar. He had no friends 
on Earth — nor could he have 
acknowledged them if he had. He 
did not wish to repeat his disap- 
pointment of the previous night, 
so he did not seek female com- 
panionship — although it was ob- 
vious from the eyes of the women 
he passed that he would have no 
difficulty whenever he changed his 
mind. But what should he do? 
What did young men do with their 
leisure, he tried to remember, when 
they had nothing but leisure? 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



15 






TTE dined alone, finally, on a 
■■"■■ variety of rare terrestrial 
foods that did not taste quite as he 
expected, and went to the theater. 
The play was one he had seen a 
hundred times before under a hun- 
dred different names on many dif- 
ferent planets. He went then to 
a nightclub, but it was crowded 
and noisy, and the girls did not 
excite him. Going back to the 
hotel, he found that sleep, at least, 
came easily. 

But I did not, he thought, do 
what I did merely for the sake of 
a good nighfs Test. 

The third day, he wandered into 
a museum. He found himself less 
bored than he had expected. Per- 
haps culture would be most thera- 
peutic for him until he reached his 
ultimate adjustments. According- 
ly, he went from the museum to a 
revival of a nineteenth-century 
opera. He didn't like it; in fact, it 
disturbed him so much that he left 
before the final curtain and walked 
through the streets for hours, until 
he ran into a girl who was also 
walking the streets, and went home 
with her. 

The experience with the drab, as 
with the courtesan, was mechani- 
cally satisfactory, emotionally in- 
adequate. He paid her — knowing 
she, too, would have given herself 
for nothing, had she known how— 
and went to his hotel limp with 
the same not-physical weakness he 
had felt before. The effects of the 



trip or the accident were lingering. 
He half expected Uvrei to appear 
that night, but the old one did not 
come. Why should he? This talk 
of spirit-son and soul-father was 
sophistry; there had been a bar- 
gain and each had kept his part. 

The afternoon of the fourth day, 
a vidicast reporter called to ask 
whether Emrys Shortmire was any 
relation to the Jan Shortmire who 
had invented the space-warp en- 
gines. Emrys could not deny his 
identity without jeopardizing his 
inheritance; however, he refused to 
be interviewed personally or let 
his picture be used. He did not, he 
said, want to be dwarfed by his 
father's reputation. Nonetheless, his 
arrival was mentioned on the news- 
casts and panic rose up in him 
when he heard his name spoken 
publicly. 

The next day a letter came for 
him. People rarely wrote letters 
any more, except to the distant 
planets, yet this one had an Earth 
postmark. Cold with panic again, 
he tore it open and read: 

My dear Mr. Shortmire: 

This evening's vidicast informed 
me that you were on Earth. You 
will not, I am sure, know my name. 
However, I was a friend of your 
father's, when we were both young 
men, and it would give me great 
pleasure to make your acquaint- 
ance. 

NICHOLAS DYALL 



16 




 



Tf MRYS crumpled up the letter 
■■-^ and hurled it across the room. 
He knew Dyall for an old— asso- 
ciate of Jan Shortmire's, but he 
had not thought him to be alive. 
What had Dyall done to warrant 
the longevity treatment? He was 
nothing but a glorified machinist, a 
technician. And now he might 
wreck all of Emrys' plans. But if 
the young man made no reply, per- 
haps the old one would take the 
hint. And so it turned out; there 
was no further word from Nicholas 
Dyall. 

Finally, two weeks after Emrys 
had first come to Earth, he got 
a telecall from Peter Hubbard. His 
documents were all in order and he 
could receive his inheritance as 
soon as he passed the physical 
examination. 

Emrys went to the doctor's of- 
fices feeling a cold touch of appre- 
hension again. But all Dr. Jameson 
said when the examination was 
finished was, "You have the 
physique of a man fifteen years 
your junior, Mr. Shortmire." 

Emrys fastened his tunic with 
fingers that shook from relief. 
"Guess I'm lucky," he muttered. 

The doctor cleared his throat. 
"Peter Hubbard was telling me 
about your mother, that she 
was . . ." 

Hubbard, that old fool! And 
Emrys had been so sure of his 
discretion. "My mother was More- 
than, yes." Then he realized it was 



possible that Hubbard, too, had 
felt there might be something not- 
quite-human manifest in his body 
and had tried to prepare the doc- 
tor. Emrys made his tone more 
conciliatory. "On both Morethis 
and Earth, the child takes citizen- 
ship from the father, so—" 

"I wasn't worrying about any 
legal problems; I was merely think- 
ing that medical science would be 
interested." 

"I do not wish the fact of my— 
of my birth publicized in any way 
— until after my death," Emrys 
added placatorily. "Surely you 
can understand what hell life 
would become if people knew I 
was half Morethan?" 

The doctor sighed. "Yes, I know. 
I can't blame you." 

"Tell me, Doctor," Emrys asked 
tensely, "is there anything about 
me that doesn't seem . . . quite 
human?" 

The doctor shook his head. 
"Only that you're so young for 
your age. Mr. Shortmire, was your 
mother one of the caste they call 
the 'immortals'?" Then he flushed. 
"Forgive me. I didn't mean to vio- 
late-" 

Emrys laughed sourly. "Don't 
worry; I don't hold to the More- 
than beliefs. She was one of the 
so-called gods, yes. They do live 
somewhat longer than either the 
common people or terrestrials; I 
guess that's why the legend arose, 
probably why I look so young, 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



17 



too. I should be glad I didn't in- 
herit a — less pleasant trait." 



"You should, indeed," the doc- 
tor said somberly. 



Ill 



CC ¥ LOVE you, Emrys," the wom- 

■■- an said, and died agonizedly 
in his arms. He looked down at 
the contorted, leaden face, ravaged 
by sickness, and thought: Even 
when she was beautiful, I could 
not love her. He could not even 
feel sorry for her, except in a re- 
mote, intellectual way. He could 
not even feel sorry for himself and 
his own inability to feel. 

Since none of the servants was 
left in the house — those who were 
still alive had fled to the country, 
where there was less chance of 
contagion — he took her body to 
the crematorium himself. Other 
people were there, consigning their 
grisly burdens to the automatic 
fires — thin, sickly creatures they 
were, who would soon be car- 
rion for the firebirds themselves. 
Whereas he — if he had an emotion 
left, it would be shame — shame 
for the radiant youth and health 
chat he saw mirrored in their dully 
wondering eyes. 

Outside, the street was clamor- 
ous with the taped importunities 
of the empty vehicles — so many 
machines, because there were so 
few people left. But he chose to 
walk. 

The air was sweet and clean, 
because the Dyall machines came 



and took away the bodies of those 
who fell in the street, and then 
cleaned those streets as careful- 
ly and tenderly as they had done 
when the walks and gutters had 
abounded with the vibrant sloven- 
liness of the living. Emrys could, 
of course, have thrown the wom- 
an's body out into the gutter, and 
the machines would have carried 
her in their steel maws to the cre- 
matorium. But some remembered 
emotion had kept him from doing 
such a thing, and had made him 
give her to the flames with what 
small ceremony he could muster. 

She had been the last mistress 
remaining to him, and probably, 
he thought, to any man in the city. 
Perhaps, out in the country, there 
might be women with life and lust 
in them still, but such women as 
were left here could no longer be 
considered women. This last one 
had not been even human for the 
past week; yet he had tended her 
— why, he could not say, except 
that he had nothing better to do. 
For one thing, she had been quieter 
when he was near her, and he 
could not bear her cries. 

He was glad when she did die, 
because playing the good Samari- 
tan had grown tedious as, in their 
turn, all other roles had palled. 






18 




 



Even though he knew there would 
be no more women for him, he 
was glad. During the first few 
weeks of the plague, when every- 
one who had been alive had known 
that soon they would be dead, all 
the people on Earth had rushed to 
squander the life which suddenly 
seemed to fill them to bursting. 
Then a man could have had all 
the women he wanted, all of any- 
thing he wanted, for the asking, ex- 
cept the one thing he really wanted 
— the assurance of life. 

TVTOT everyone had plunged into 
-*■ ^ an orgy of joyless pleasure. 
There were some who took refuge 
in prayer — addressed either to the 
traditional Deity or to the recent 
importations from the other planets. 
But, in the end, it was the same for 
all, prayerful and profligate alike. 
The only exceptions were the 
lucky few who seemed to be im- 
mune, like Emrys Shortmire, and 
those who escaped from the cities 
—to the country or, if they were 
rich, the other planets. So, even if 
Emrys had craved women before, 
he would have had enough of them 
by now. 

As he passed through the streets, 
he heard a man who walked alone 
and talked to himself curse the 
name of Jan Shortmire. They 
would tear me to pieces if they 
knew I was his flesh and bloody 
Emrys thought, and smiled to think 
how once he had feared to be en- 



gulfed by Jan Shortmire's reputa- 
tion, and now he feared to be de- 
stroyed by it. 

For it had been a starship 
equipped, like all starships, with 
the Shortmire engines that had 
brought back the plague — a star- 
ship probing the distant corners 
of the Galaxy which were all that 
Man's insatiable curiosity had left 
undiscovered. 

Far out, even beyond Morethis 
— outermost of the discovered 
planets — in the middle of the 
dead and dying stars that were all 
there was in this chill, cold sector 
of space, the ship had come upon 
three dead planets, dark and life- 
less. But when it returned to Earth 
to report the end of Man's am- 
bitions for further conquest, it 
turned out that one planet had 
not been quite as lifeless as they 
had fancied. And the ship had 
brought back its life — a virus 
against which terrestrial medicine 
was powerless. 

Emrys could have fled the city; 
he could have fled the planet. But 
somehow, after three years on 
Earth, he had not wanted to. He 
had spent those years fulfilling the 
dreams that all young men dream 
in the murky part of their souls but 
seldom have the chance to gratify. 

As soon as the inheritance was 
his, he had bought the most lavish 
mansion that was available at the 
instant of his desire, furnished it 
extravagantly, and prepared to en- 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



19 






joy himself. His pleasures were 
many and, some of them, strange. 
At first his mistresses were human, 
then non-human. Females of all 
the intelligent species, save the 
Morethan, were to be found on 
Earth, and although consorting 
with extraterrestrials was illegal, 
still a wealthy man had never been 
too much troubled by laws. 

But women — females — repre- 
sented only a fraction of his pleas- 
ures, as did the terrestrial vices. 
He indulged heavily in rrilla, 
zbokth, mburrje, and all the other 
outworld pursuits that had been 
imported from the planets where 
the native life had been intelligent 
enough for decadence. 

TTOWEVER, though he pushed 
-■"■- his body a thousand times be- 
yond what should have been the 
limits of his endurance, the dis- 
tress he had suffered during the 
first hours of his landing on Earth 
did not recur. He remained as clear 
of eye and trim of form as ever; 
each physical excess seemed only 
to improve his splendid health. 

Oddly, he did not seem to enjoy 
these pleasures as much as he had 
anticipated. Something seemed 
lacking. It was always like this 
when you dreamed too long about 
something, he told himself; no re- 
sult ever equaled its expectation. 
And he took another one of the 
sparkling pills from Morethis. 
They provided the only satisfac- 



tion he seemed able to get. 

Emrys had been wrong about 
Uvrei's indifference. He apparent- 
ly did consider Emrys his responsi- 
bility, over and above the material 
details of the bargain. The More- 
thans regarded all those of alien 
species as enemies, and all those 
outside the clan as unfriends. 
Therefore, Emrys began to realize 
the ceremonies of adoption he had 
gone through were more than mere- 
ly honorific or ritual — they had 
been genuine. It was an uncom- 
fortable conclusion. 

"Well, son of my spirit," Uvrei 
would keep asking, "is this what 
you wanted?" 

"This is what I wanted, father 
of my soul," Emrys would agree. 
And it was what he had asked, 
what he had thought he wanted. 

The ancient one would smile 
and say, "Then I am content," and 
recombine into fog. And Emrys 
would wonder whether the More- 
thans had not known before they 
granted him his heart's desire that 
it would turn to dust and ashes 
when he had it. Then he would 
dismiss the thought, telling him- 
self maybe he'd been too impatient 
for pleasure. After all, how could 
he, sprung full-blown into a quasi- 
alien society, hope to become an 
integral part of it all at once? 

So he had waited . . . one year, 
two years, three years. At the end 
of the fourth, the plague had struck. 
And he had stayed on Earth, be- 



20 







 



cause going to another planet 
somehow did not seem worthwhile. 
He was able to take care of his 
house alone, since the servants had 
been primarily for show, and the 
great Dyall machine — which was 
all the house, essentially, was — 
could run itself. Whenever a part 
of it broke down, he repaired it 
himself, glad of the opportunity to 
have something to do with his 
hands. 

Finally he realized that he must 
be immune; hence a lifetime waited 
ahead of him. So he turned to 
learning, for the vast libraries of 
tapes and books remained change- 
less amid the disaster. He read and 
he learned a great deal, and if he 
could not derive pleasure from 
this, at least there was a deep in- 
tellectual appreciation that almost 
took its place. 

The doctors on Ndrikull, the 
most advanced of the other planets, 
at last managed to find a serum 
that would kill the plague — that 
is, they maintained it was their 
serum that had killed it. Some sug- 
gested that the virus had died be- 
cause Earth's environment had 
eventually proved hostile to it. But 
Earth did not die, even though 
most of its people had, because 
the great machines that took care 
of it — the Dyall machines — had 
kept functioning. 

Gradually, most of the people 
who had fled to the other planets 
came back, and those who had 



survived in the country returned 
to the cities. Earth was restored 
to its former splendor as the so- 
cial and political capital of the Gal- 
axy, though Ndrikull now was the 
financial center and rivaled Earth 
for artistic honors. But still Emrys 
stuck to his books. Once in a while, 
he would sink himself for a week 
or a month in what would be, for 
other men, physical pleasure, just 
to see if his reactions had changed, 
but they had grown even more im- 
personal. 

WfHEN Emrys Shortmire had 
™ been ten years on Earth, he 
eventually ran into Nicholas Dyall, 
at the opening of a scientific expo- 
sition. As soon as he saw Dyall in 
the crowd, he turned to go, but 
Dyall had seen him at the same 
time, and hurriedly limped across 
the room. 

"You must be Emrys Short- 
mire," he declared, in a voice of 
surprising resonance for so old a 
man. "You look so much like Jan, 
I couldn't be mistaken." Grasping 
his stick with one hand for sup- 
port, he extended the other to Em- 
rys, who could not refuse it. "But 
you are so young . . ." 

"I'm older than I look," Emrys 
said uncomfortably; then remem- 
bered to add, "You were a friend 
of my father's, sir?" 

"A hundred years ago, yes. My 
name is Nicholas Dyall." 

"IVe heard of you; you're the 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



21 






man who — who invented all those 
machines," Emrys said, trying not 
to sound too ingenuous. "I've heard 
people say you revolutionized our 
technology as much as—" 

"As much as your father revo- 
lutionized our civilization? Yes, 
both of us are responsible for a 
great deal. Luckily, your father is 
dead." 

"Luckily?" Emrys echoed. 

"Luckily for him, I mean." The 
old man sighed. "But you are too 
young to understand." Then his 
dark face relaxed into a smile. "I 
won't ask if you received the let- 
ter I sent when you first arrived 
on Earth. I can understand that a 
young man would wish the society 
of other — young people." 

Emrys avoided Dyall's eye, and, 
so doing, met the gaze of the girl 
standing next to the old man, and 
stopped, transfixed. She was very 
young, less than forty, he judged, 
perhaps even less than thirty. 

It was long since he had seen a 
woman like her. Her hair was a 
soft yellow, the only natural color 
among all the women in the room. 
Her face was painted pink and 
white, not the blues fashionable 
that year. Instead of being twisted 
and bedizened with cloth into fan- 
tastic shapes and protuberances, 
her pretty body was clad in a 
simple translucent slip. Yet, in 
spite of her almost deliberate dow- 
diness, she was beautiful — not the 
most beautiful woman he had ever 

22 



seen, but the most ... no, striking 
was not it, either. What was the 
word he wanted? He could not 
dredge it out of the pool in which 
so many of his memories had been 
submerged for want of room. 

"This is my great-great-grand- 
daughter Megan," Dyall intro- 
duced her. The girl nodded and 
smiled. After a moment, Emrys 
forced himself to do the same. 

"I won't press you to come 
visit us, Mr. Shortmire," Dyall said 
to Emrys as he and his descendant 
finally turned to leave, "but I hope 
that you will." 

"We should be so glad to see 
you," the girl said, with a shy 
smile. 

"Perhaps— perhaps I will come," 
he found himself saying. "One 
day." The two men shook hands, 
and Nicholas Dyall and his great- 
great-granddaughter moved away. 
Emrys stared after them for a 
minute; then, without paying any 
attention to the exhibits, he went 
back to his house and spent the 
rest of the evening staring at the 
falling flakes in his snowplace. 

For years, he had thought he'd 
lost any capacity to feel. Now he 
knew that was not true . . . be- 
cause he had been moved by 
Megan Dyall. How, he could not 
say — not even whether it was love 
or hate he felt toward her — but 
he felt That was the important 
thing, and, because of that, he had 
to take the risk and call on them. 


 



HE waited a week, then went 
to the Dyall house — a man- 
sion, less ostentatious than his, but 
probably more expensive. Dyall 
greeted him warmly. "I'm glad you 
decided to come. Your father and 
I were not close friends, but he 
was the only one left of my genera- 
tion whom I knew. It was a shock 
to hear of his passing, even though 
I hadn't seen him for a century 
or so." 

"You've lived for such a long 
time, Grandpa," Megan said in 
her high, sweet voice, "it's hard to 
imagine. But why doesn't every- 
body get the longevity treatment, 
so we can all live a long time?" 

"Because it's difficult and ex- 
pensive," her ancestor said, smil- 
ing over her golden head at Em- 
rys. "Because the old must make 
way for the young. It is only given 
to those whose lives, the govern- 
ment feels, should be prolonged, 
either because of the contributions 
they can still make, or whose con- 
tributions have already been so 
great that this is the only fitting 
reward." 

The girl stared at him with large 
blue eyes. "Does that mean you 
will live forever, Grandpa?" 

"No," the old man told her. "All 
our science can give is an extra 
half century. I don't know how 
long my life span would have been, 
but I'm past the average and the 
extra half century, and so I'm liv- 
ing on borrowed time." 



The blue eyes filled with tears. 
"I don't want you to die, Grandpa. 
I don't want to grow old and die, 
either." 

Dyall looked down at her, and 
there was, Emrys thought, an odd 
perplexity in his gaze. Didn't he 
find it natural for a young girl not 
to like the idea of old age, of 
death? 

"But I shall want to die when 
my time comes, Megan," Dyall 
said. "We all will." Gently, he 
touched her cheek. "Perhaps, by 
the time you make your contribu- 
tion to society, scientists will know 
how to give youth as well as extra 
years. More years are not really 
much of a gift to the old." 

"But I can't do anything, Grand- 
pa," she sobbed. "I have nothing 
to contribute." 

It was an outrage, Emrys 
thought, that this woman, by be- 
ing the essence of femininity, 
should be denied the ultimate re- 
ward society had to offer. Mother- 
hood alone should entitle her . . . 
He was, of course, already envi- 
sioning himself as the father of her 
children. But could he be a father? 

Old Dyall was saying, "Perhaps, 
Megan, by the time you are old 
enough, our government will be 
wise enough to realize that beauty, 
of itself, deserves the greatest re- 
ward Man can give." He turned to 
Emrys. "Forgive me for getting so 
sentimental, but Megan looks as 
uncannily like her great-great- 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT

grandmother — my wife — as . . . 
you look like your father. I can't 
bear to think she must die, too. If s 
a pity there is no way she can 
stay young and beautiful for all 
time." 

Emrys found his fists clenching. 
The fingers were cold. 

"Alissa's portrait was painted 
just before I married her," the 
old man said. "She was just about 
Megan's age 1jien. Come, I'd like 
you to see it." 

No! something inside Emrys 



cried out, but he could not cour- 
teously — or any other way — re- 
fuse to follow the old man. 

They went into another room. 
Hanging over the mantelpiece was 
the painting of a girl in old-fash- 
ioned clothes. Anyone, not know- 
ing, would have taken her to be 
Megan. But Emrys knew she was 
not, and suddenly he let himself 
remember what it was that Megan 
meant to him . . . and why he hated 
Nicholas Dyall with such coruscat- 
ing fury.

?? "V7"OU should have sent for me 
*~ to come to you, Mr. Hub- 
bard," Nicholas Dyall said, with a 
gentle pity that infuriated the old 
lawyer, who knew that he himself 
was young enough to be Dyall's 
grandson. Hubbard was jealous— he 
would not conceal it from himself 
— bitterly jealous. It had not been 
hard for him to rationalize Jan 
Shortmire's gift of years as a 
worthless one; that old man's bit- 
terness and disillusionment had 
not inspired envy. But this hale 
and rosy old man seemed to be 
enjoying his years. 

J may not have made any signal 
contribution to human welfare, 
Hubbard thought resentfully, but 1 
have done my best. Why must I 
die at an age fifty years short of 
the age which this man is allowed 
to reach? 



"I am perfectly able to get 
about, Mr. Dyall," he said in icy 
tones, "since I am in excellent 
health." 

Which he was, the doctor had 
told him, adding, however, "for 
your age." 

"What is more," Hubbard con- 
tinued, "since I was on Ndrikull, 
it might have seemed rather pre- 
sumptuous for me to send for you; 
whereas I had always been plan- 
ning to return to Earth one day. 
I left at the time of the plague." 

"You were wise. I merely re- 
tired to the country. I escaped the 
virus, but the rest of my family 
was less fortunate. I have but one 
remaining — my great-great-grand- 
daughter." 

"Yes," Hubbard said, "I know. 
It's because of her I've come to 
see you." 



24 




 



He had not really planned ever 
to return to Earth. Ndrikull had 
been comfortable and a man of his 
age did not risk a trip through 
space unless the need was urgent 
The memory of Emrys Shortmire 
had disturbed him from time to 
time, but, he thought, probably 
the young man had died of the 
plague. Even if he had not, what 
good would it do for Peter Hub- 
bard to be present on Earth? He 
could not counteract the presence 
of an evil force without knowing 
the quality of that evil. 

Then, picking up the kind of 
journal he did not usually read, 
he had seen mentioned the fact 
that Jan Shortmire's son was 
"courting" Nicholas Dyall's great- 
great-granddaughter. And he had 
known the need was now urgent. 
He must go back to Earth and 
warn someone; it was his duty. A 
letter could not convey the hatred 
and fear with which the young 
man had inspired him. Obviously, 
old Dyall had been the person to 
warn. Yet he did not seem right. 

/ do not like this man, Hubbard 
thought. And then: This is the 
second man I have taken such an 
instant dislike to. Can it be senili- 
ty rather than perceptiveness, and 
have I been foolish to come all 
this way? 

"YouVe come because of Me- 
gan?" Dyall raised eyebrows that 
were still thick and black. "Have 
you met her? Do you know her?" 



His voice sharpened. "She has 
never spoken of you." 

"I have never met her," Hub- 
bard said, and saw Dyall relax. 
Hubbard waited, but the other 
man said nothing, so he went on, 
"I wanted to talk to you about 
the man she's been seeing, this 
Emrys Shortmire." Leaning for- 
ward, Hubbard spoke slowly, as if, 
by giving weight to each word, he 
could make them sound less fan- 
tastic. "He's a monster. Literally, 
I mean. His mother was a More- 
than. Or is. For all I know, she 
may still be alive." 

TTUBBARD had not thought of 
•*■-■■ this before, and it shook him. 
Yet, if Iloa Tasqi was alive, then 
Emrys Shortmire must be consid- 
ered to be, to all intents and pur- 
poses, Morethan entirely, working 
only for the interests of that planet 
After all, his mother had been the 
only parent the boy had known. 
Even on Clergal, he must have 
been brought up under a strong 
Morethan influence. Now, if the 
female was still alive, then the in- 
fluence would be alive, too. Since 
Morethans were not permitted on 
Earth, there would be an obvious 
advantage for them in having 
someone here. 

Dyall was holding back a smile, 
not too well. "I didn't know a hu- 
man and a Morethan could — ah — 
breed together." 

And, obviously, he didn't be- 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



25 









soc 



lieve it. There was no way Hub- 
bard could prove it, unless he 
asked Emrys to produce his birth 
certificate again. "It isn't general- 
ly known that the two species can 
reproduce together," he finally said, 
"nor should it be." 

Then he looked directly in Dy- 
all's black eyes — impossible that 
eyes so keen should be so deliber- 
ately blind, that any aware human 
being should not have sensed 
something of that dark aura. 
"Haven't you felt something 
strange about young Shortmire?" 
he asked. 

"Can't say I have," Dyall 
chuckled. "He seems an agreeable 
enough young fellow." 

"He's sixty-five years old." 

"Really? I should have taken 
him to be younger. But youth lasts 
longer these days. And there's—" 
Dyall gave a little laugh — "no 
crime in being old, or you and I 
would be in prison, wouldn't we?" 

Hubbard would not let himself 
be distracted. "He looked less than 
forty when he came to Earth, and 
he hasn't, I understand, changed 
in the past ten years." 

"Ten years is not so long." 
Dyall's swarthy hands began play- 
ing with the ornaments on his desk. 
Clearly, he was impatient to be 
rid of his tedious caller, and Hub- 
bard struggled with the instinctive 
good breeding that told him to 
get up and leave. This was not a 
social call, so it did not matter that 



he was boring his host, however. 

On the other hand, he was not 
getting anywhere. Perhaps he 
could blast the other out of his 
smugness. "Look, Dyall, I know 
this is an outrageous thing for a 
man of my profession to say. I 
haven't a shred of proof, not a sus- 
picion — but I'm morally sure he 
killed his father." 

Instead of showing shock or an- 
ger or even thought, Dyall merely 
gave him a tolerant smile. "You're 
an old man, Mr. Hubbard. We're 
both old men," he amended gra- 
ciously, "so we're apt to — jump at 
shadows." 

I'm an old man, Hubbard 
thought angrily, and yotfre an old 
tool! 

"There doesn't seem to be any- 
thing wrong with the young man," 
Dyall continued, "or not-so-young 
man, if you prefer. He appears to 
be very fond of Megan, and if he 
should choose to marry her, it 
would ease my mind considerably. 
I've exceeded my life span myself, 
you know." 

Since Peter Hubbard had done 
the same, and his span was con- 
siderably shorter, he had no sym- 
pathy. "You'd — let the strain con- 
tinue?" 

"Perhaps it's a good strain. I 
understand the Morethans are said 
to be immortal. If so, the genes 
might be a desirable addition to 
our own." 

He was laughing openly now. 


 



Hubbard almost wept with help- 
lessness. There must be something 
he could do. But what? He could 
not take the trip to Morethis; he 
would certainly die on the way. 
And what could he do there? There 
was no guarantee that, if there was 
anything to be found, he would 
find it, or even if he reached the 
planet alive, that he would go back 
alive. 

"Won't you stay and dine with 
us tonight, Mr. Hubbard?" Dyall 
asked. 

"No — no, thank you," Hubbard 
said, feeling no necessity for mak- 
ing an excuse. The offer had repre- 
sented only the barest kind of 
courtesy. 

Dyall got up. "Perhaps another 
night then?" 

"Perhaps." Hubbard rose to his 
feet also, trying to appear brisk 
and alert and young. At least he 
could walk without aid, he thought, 
staring pointedly at the stick lean- 
ing against the wall. "I would 
rather you didn't tell Shortmire I 
had come to see you about him." 

"Of course not, if you wish." 

But Hubbard knew Dyall would 
not keep the stranger's visit from 
his friend. Odd that Dyall and 
young Shortmire should be friends. 
Not so odd either, though; young 
Shortmire had no reason to love 
his father. Besides, although Jan 
Shortmire had hated Nicholas 
Dyall, that did not mean Nicholas 
Dyall had hated Jan Shortmire, 



or even knew of the other man's 
animosity. 

AS he was riding back to his 
-™ hotel, Hubbard let his tired 
old body indulge the aches and 
pains that were its rightful heritage. 
As his body relaxed, his mind re- 
laxed, and he began to think more 
clearly. Perhaps Dyall would not 
listen to him — perhaps Dyall had 
some reason for not listening — but 
the government might. 

What young Shortmire might 
have done as a human, they would 
consider a matter for local law — 
but the fact that human and More- 
than had begotten offspring would 
interest them. The fact that the 
Morethans might have managed at 
last to get a spy on Earth would in- 
terest them. If Emrys would not 
surrender his birth certificate, they 
could get another from Clergal. 
Only, would the government's 
representative believe Hubbard 
enough to get that birth certificate? 
Or would they, like Dyall, dismiss 
him as a doddering old fool? 

The private humiliation had 
been hard enough; he hated to 
risk a public one. But it was his 
duty to tell officialdom of his sus- 
picions, he knew miserably. Never 
again could he think with pride of 
himself as a worthy citizen if he 
didn't at least make the attempt. 
Never again could he let himself 
feel a justifiable jealousy of those 
with endowments superior to his, if 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



27 



he did not prove himself worthy 
of what he had. 

Well, there was no hurry; he 
would sleep on it. He was mis- 
taken. In the morning, before he 
had even started to decide upon 
any course of action, the front desk 
called to announce that a Mr. 
Shortmire wished to see him. 

"Very well," the old lawyer said 
wearily into the machine, to the 
machine, for it was the Dyall itself 
speaking. "Send him up." 



A short while later, there was a 
rap on the door. "Come in," Hub- 
bard called. 

The door slid open. A man en- 
tered, a tawny golden youth with 
eyes like burnished metal. "Do 
you know who I am, Peter?" 

"Of course," Hubbard said, faint- 
ly disgusted, since he considered 
melodrama vulgar. "You're Emrys 
Shortmire." 

"You're wrong," the man said. 
"I'm Jan Shortmire." 






Tj 1 MRYS Shortmire had gone 
*-* home the night Dyall had 
shown him the portrait of his 
long-dead wife, and Emrys had 
dreamed, not of Megan Dyall, but 
of Alissa Embel, Megan's great- 
great-grandmother, whom he had 
wanted a hundred years before, 
and who had married Nicholas 
Dyall. Consciously, he had forgot- 
ten her, but at the back of his 
mind, she had, for over a century, 
walked hand in hand with his 
hatred. 

That night he understood what 
he had not realized then. He had 
completed the engines with which 
he had been tinkering for years 
with a real vengeance. He had 
taken the first starship out into 
space himself — when no one had 
faith in his engines, least of all 
himself — merely "to show her" 
what a great man he was, even if 



he died in the showing. In his 
spite, he had opened up the stars 
for mankind. 

And when he returned, years 
later, he found that Dyall, too, had 
stopped tinkering and had changed 
the pattern of his gadgets to one 
more acceptable to the public taste. 
Before, they had operated quite 
satisfyingly, but they had not been 
salable in the shape he had given 
them, and no manufacturer had 
been interested in leasing the 
patents. Now that he had yielded, 
manufacturers were falling all over 
themselves to get the right to pro- 
duce his machines. 

Dyall's was not as soul-stirring 
a success as Shortmire's — he did 
not inspire cheering crowds and 
parades — but a more enduringly 
popular one. The Shortmire en- 
gines carried humanity to the stars, 
but it was the Dyall machines that 



28 




 



cooked humanity's dinners and 
kept its houses clean. So humanity 
respected Jan Shortmire and took 
Nicholas Dyall to its collective 
heart. 

Emrys awakened, remembering 
all this and rigid with loathing for 
Nicholas Dyall, and for the world 
which had allowed Nicholas Dyall 
to take from him something he 
had wanted. Something which had, 
as soon as he'd known for sure he'd 
lost it forever, become what he 
wanted most. And also he hated 
the world which had given Alissa 
Embel to Dyall and had then pro- 
ceeded to heap on him in addition 
every honor Jan Shortmire himself 
had won in an effort to make up 
for what he'd lost. Jan Shortmire 
had risked his life in space; Nich- 
olas Dyall had sat comfortably in 
his chair — and both were equally 
honored. 

Then Emrys — as Emrys — 
caught hold of himself. It was true 
that originally there had been in- 
justice. But it had been righted 
and so there was no more reason 
to hate Dyall. J have a second 
chance, but he will have none. I 
will live out another full lifetime, 
and I will have Megan, too, and 
he'll die in a few years. And as 
for the world, I have already re- 
venged myself on it in advance. 

He got up and pulled a spun- 
metal robe about him, amethyst 
and sable — a gift from Morethis. 
There was always a costly gift on 



his birthday, either out of kindness 
or cruelty, together with a vial of 
the golden capsules. 

What a pity, he thought, as he 
went downstairs, that Dyall and 
the world both would never know 
the truth: that Jan Shortmire had 
no son, that Emrys and Jan Short- 
mire were one. 

HP HE Morethans first came to 
-*- Jan Shortmire when, approach- 
ing his natural old age, he had trav- 
eled as a visitor to their planet— 
largely because old men did not 
go to Morethis — and they had 
made him their offer. He had 
laughed in their dark and exquisite 
faces. 

"My own government will give 
me fifty years more of life," he 
said, for he had heard, during the 
voyage out, that he would be on 
the next honors list. "What need 
do I have of you?" 

"We can give you far more than 
fifty years," they'd told him. "And 
youth, besides." 

At that, he had stopped laugh- 
ing, but still he had not accepted 
their offer, for many reasons . . . 
doubt and fear, perhaps some 
shreds of honor, and certainly, 
since he was a man of science, 
skepticism. 

Then, when Shortmire was near- 
ing the end of those fifty extra 
years which had, indeed, been 
granted him by a grateful Earth 
government — together with a 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



29 



plaque, suitably inscribed — he 
had received a gift. It was one of 
those great crystalline prisms from 
Morethis that were so fashionable 
on Earth as lighting fixtures, not 
because they saved fuel — for one 
such prism would cost ten life- 
times of fuel — but because they 
gave a light no Earthborn device 
could give, making the old look 
young, the stupid wise, and, most 
important of all, the ugly beautiful. 

Short mire looked into the lam- 
bent depths, wondering who had 
sent him so costly and so useless a 
gift. Suddenly the flame vitrified 
into a face that flashed up at him 
from the crystal — a face that was 
beautiful in its horror, and hor- 
rible in its beauty. He closed his 
eyes, but when he opened them, 
the iridescent eyes were still there, 
mocking him for his cowardice. 

"I am Uvrei," a deep voice of 
tingling sweetness said, "god among 
gods and man among men. I bring 
you greetings from Morethis, Jan 
Shortmire." 

Shortmire knew well enough 
what Uvrei must want, for the 
Morethans' long-ago offer had risen 
of late to the top of his thoughts. 
They could not do what they 
claimed, he had tried to reassure 
himself, whenever the memory re- 
turned; it was a trick which he 
had been clever enough not to 
fall for. But part of his mind did 
not believe this, and that part was 
glad to see Uvrei. 



"What do you want of me?" he 
demanded. 

The Morethan smiled, and each 
glittering tooth was a fiery bril- 
liant. "The same as before, on the 
same terms," he said, offering no 
enticements. The man who would 
accept such an offer would pro- 
vide his own. 

TF they were capable of doing 
-*- this . . . thing with the crystal, 
then they might also have other 
powers. So Shortmire could no 
longer pretend that what they of- 
fered him was impossible. On the 
other hand, what they required of 
him in return was truly terrible. 
Could they really do what they 
said? 

After all, my world has not done 
overmuch for me. Others, like 
Nicholas Dyall, have wealth and 
power and . . . He would not let 
himself think of Alissa Dyall, since 
she must long be dead, of old age, 
if nothing else. The last he had 
heard of her was when she and 
Dyall had announced their wed- 
ding date. Then he had taken the 
ship fitted out with the engines 
everyone said would not work, and 
he had fled into space. When he 
had come back, no one had spoken 
of her, and gradually, in his new- 
found importance, he had to some 
degree forgotten her, though he 
never forgot Dyall. 

Pity to think of Alissa as having 
grown old. Even more of a pity to 



30 




 



think of himself as having grown 
old, for he could see that in every 
mirror he passed. 

"You're sure you can give me 
youth as well as life?" he asked. 

"Not only youth, but perpetual 
youth," Uvrei assured him. "Youth 
such as you did not know even 
when you were young." 

But Shortmire was still suspi- 
cious. Even if the Morethans could 
do what they said, how did he 
know they would? An alien con- 
cept of honor might have no refer- 
ence to the terrestrial one. "How 
do I know I can trust your word?" 

Uvrei's face grew black, literal- 
ly black, and the crystal shivered 
until, Emrys thought, it would 
split. And he shivered, too, know- 
ing in the fine nerves and little 
muscles of his body what would 
happen to him at the final shiver- 
ing. A fear filled him then that he 
had never known before, not even 
when he faced space for the first 
time, and in the midst of that fear 
came the thought that, if he truly 
hated Earth, this was the most ar- 
tistically nasty revenge he could 
take. 

JT^HE crystal trembled to still- 
*■- ness as Uvrei's face paled to 
composure. "If you were not an 
Earthman, Jan Shortmire," he said, 
"we would not have needed you, 
nor you us. And an Earthman 
could not be expected to know that 
the words you have just spoken are 



the insult that, on Morethis, is 
deadlier than death; for the word 
of an immortal — no matter to 
whom or what he gives it — is as 
sacred and enduring as he himself." 

"I apologize," Shortmire said 
quickly, "for my ignorance." 

"And I forgive you," Uvrei de- 
clared, as grandly as if he were a 
god, "because of that ignorance. 
Moreover, since you cannot help 
your racial deficiencies, I will make 
this bargain with you. Come to 
Morethis. There we will give you 
the life and youth we promised. 
Then, when you are satisfied that 
we have given you what you de- 
sire, you will give us what we de- 
sire." 

Not having been too honorable 
a man in his own hundred and fif- 
ty-five years, Jan Shortmire still 
could not believe that the More- 
thans would act in all honor. How- 
ever, even the remote possibility 
that they would play fair was 
strong temptation for an ardent 
man pushing death. So he had 
agreed. He had wound up his af- 
fairs and made his will in favor of 
"his son." Then he had left Earth 
to go to Morethis, to die as Jan 
Shortmire and he resurrected as 
Emrys Shortmire. 

The Morethans had kept their 
word, though there were times 
when he wished they had not. For 
no phoenix casting itself into the 
fire to burn alive in agony, so 
that it might rise again, young and 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



31 









strong and purified, from the ashes 
of its own dead self, could have 
suffered the excruciating torment 
of both mind and body that he 
suffered as, little by little, he was 
made young again. 

Uvrei had warned him that this 
would happen. "To become one 
of us, you must be capable of all- 
endurance." So, for three years, he 
had lived on the miasmic planet, 
suffering unending, unbearable 
pain — not only his, but of the 
others whose lives went to make 
his new life. Slowly, agonizingly, 
these were stirred into the shriek- 
ing cauldrons of his body, until 
they blended and melted and 
coalesced to become his new shape. 

Then Uvrei had led him cere- 
moniously to a reflecting glass and 
shown him Emrys Shortmire — a 
boy far more handsome than the 
boy Jan Shortmire had been, 
though, at the same time, his twin. 
The only thing not quite human 
about Emrys Shortmire was his 
eyes, and how could they be hu- 
man after what they had seen? 
But he would forget all that once 
he was back on Earth, forget the 
payment that had been exacted — 
and prepare to live his new life 
to the full. 

A LL this Emrys Shortmire told 
-™ Peter Hubbard in the quiet 
of the expensive hotel room. It 
was pleasant to be able to un- 
burden himself at last. For the past 



eleven years, there had been a 
secret side of him that must al- 
ways walk apart, even from Me- 
gan. Now there was someone who 
could know the whole of him, and 
he was grateful to Hubbard for 
having come back to Earth. 

But Hubbard sat there staring 
with so fixed a gaze that, for a mo- 
ment, Emrys thought he was dead. 
Then he realized that it was only 
shock; all this had been too much 
for so old a man. Selfishly, he had 
heaped his burden upon another, 
without asking whether that other 
was willing, or able, to share it. 

"Peter," he began, "I'm sorry . . ." 
not quite sure for what he was 
apologizing. He could not have 
trusted the old man at the begin- 
ning, just as he had to trust him 
now. But of course he was apolo- 
gizing to Peter Hubbard, as the 
representative of humanity, for 
what he himself had done to Earth. 

He began to give unasked-for 
explanations. "I deliberately made 
you suspect I killed my father, be- 
cause if you suspected one of us 
had done away with the other, 
why, then, you'd automatically 
have assumed there were two." 
He looked down at the floor. "And 
I wanted you to hate me. We 
couldn't be friends; otherwise, 
knowing me better than anyone 
else alive, you might have 
guessed . . ." 

"I doubt it," Hubbard said 
wearily. "Almost anything else 



32

would have seemed more likely." 
Presently he asked, "Weren't you 
afraid I might investigate?" 

Emrys smiled. "What could you 
find out? After all, I hadn't killed 
Jan Shortmire." 

The smile became a little fixed. 
"I wouldn't have cared even if 
you had told someone your suspi- 
cions then," Emrys went on dog- 
gedly, "because I knew no one 
would believe you. But now—" he 



colored — "well, I don't want you 
to tell Megan Dyall anything . . . 
bad about me. You see, I . . . love 
her." 

"I gathered that impression," 
Hubbard said. 

But why does he sound so un- 
happy about it? Emrys thought 
angrily. Whafs wrong with me? 
Because he was in love, he could 
not appreciate the irony of that 
thought. 



VI 




PETER Hubbard looked at his 
old friend with the young face 
and the young body and the eyes 
that were unhuman — but less so 
than before. This was a frightful 
thing that had been done, and by 
and by he would feel the full 
horror of it. Right now he was too 
numb to care. He felt, as Emrys 
Shortmire must have felt on com- 
ing back to Earth, detached and 
without interest. But I've felt this 
way before, he thought; ifs because 
Vm old. 

"Were you really satisfied with 
your bargain, Jan?" he asked, al- 
most casually. 

"Not at first," the boy admitted, 
sinking down on the couch and 
clasping his hands around his 
knees. So young, so graceful, and 
so . . . unnatural. "It seemed to 
me then that the Morethans had 
given me youth and taken away 
humanity. Because, once I found I 



was physically capable, I found I 
didn't really want the things I had 
craved so much before." 

"So they did trick you?" When 
all was said and done, Hubbard 
thought, you could never trust an 
alien life-form, a foreigner. 

"No, no! You still don't under- 
stand. The way I see it is that . . . 
certain elements in us may not 
mean anything to them. They don't 
know they're there, so they 
wouldn't realize that anything got 
lost in . . .the process." 

"Do you think, Jan," Hubbard 
asked slowly, "that the way you 
felt — or didn't feel — might not 
have anything to do with the 
Morethans at all? That, for all 
your young body, you are an old 
man and feel like an old man?" 

"Nonsense! I know what it is to 
feel like an old man, and I know 
what it is to feel like a young man, 
and I - I felt like neither." 


 



"When a man has lived a cer- 
tain number of years," Hubbard 
said, knowing that envy gave the 
truth relish, "he is an old man. 
Age is in the mind and heart, not 
only in the body." 

"That's a lie!" Then Emrys said, 
more calmly, "If that's so, why did 
everything change when I met 
Megan? Because I found then that 
my emotions had not been lost! 
I had a feeling for her that I'd 
never had for another woman — 
not even for Alissa, I think. I hadn't 
imagined there could be a woman 
like Megan in the world, so sweet 
and amiable and completely femi- 
nine." He looked angrily at Hub- 
bard. "You think I'm sentimental, 
don't you?" 

Hubbard tried to smile. "There's 
nothing wrong with sentiment." But 
sentimentality was characteristic 
of an old man's love. 

Emrys laughed and hugged his 
knees. He was overdoing the in- 
genuousness. Of course he deliber- 
ately played the part of a boy 
young enough to be his own great- 
great-grandson, because he was 
wooing a woman young enough to 
be his own great-great-granddaugh- 
ter. And Hubbard remembered 
how he himself had attempted to 
move briskly before Nicholas 
Dyall. Emrys Shortmire would not 
have the physical aches that he'd 
had as a result, but could there 
be psychical aches? Could an old 
man ever actually be young? 



T? MRYS' face grew sober. "I've 
-" never touched her, Peter — 
really touched her, I mean. She's 
not like other women, you know." 

"I know," Hubbard said, remem- 
bering back to the time when he, 
too, had been in love. Only the 
memory was not tender in him, be- 
cause he had married the girl and 
lived with her for nearly seventy 
years. 

"Peter, you aren't listening!" 

"I'm sorry," the old man said, 
waking from his reverie. "What 
were you saying?" 

"I said, do you think Megan 
would be willing to marry me, if 
she knew I was older than her 
great-great-grandfather?" 

But there was a more important 
question that Hubbard could no 
longer refuse to face. "Jan, what 
did you give the Morethans in re- 
turn for what they gave you?" 

"You haven't answered my 
question." 

"I can't answer it, because I 
don't know the girl. But you can 
answer mine, because you know 
what you gave the Morethans." 

Emrys was silent for a moment; 
then he laughed. "I gave them my 
soul," he said lightly. "Like that 
fellow in the opera." 

"I know that. What I'm afraid 
of is that it wasn't enough. In what 
form did you give it to them, 
Jan?" 

"You have no right to catechize 
me like that." 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



35 






The old man's voice was soft. "I 
think I have." 

Emrys was a long time in an- 
swering. When he finally spoke, 
his voice was flat and dead. "All 
right, I gave them the blueprints 
for the space-warp engines. What 
else did I have to give them in 
exchange?" 

Hubbard expelled a long breath. 
He had answered this question for 
himself many minutes before. Still, 
the shock of confirmation was too 
great. All hope was gone now. "Per- 
haps you had a right to sell your 
own soul, Jan, but you had no 
right to sell humanity's." His good 
breeding held up all the way. This 
man had betrayed the whole of 
mankind, and so he, Peter Hub- 
bard, reproached him gently for it. 
Though, come to think of it, what 
good would savage recrimination— 
or anything— do? 

"But you don't have to worry 
about it, Peter!" Emrys cried. 
"Listen, the Morethan technology 
is so alien, so different from ours, 
because it's based on mental rather 
than physical forces, that it'll take 
centuries before they can acquire 
the techniques they'll need to build 
the engines. And they'll have 
trouble getting the materials. We'll 
both have been long in our graves 
by the time they'll reach Earth." 

"And that makes it all right? 
It doesn't matter to you what hap- 
pens to your own home planet 
once you are dead?" 



THE young-looking face was 
flushed. "Why should it? Does 
Earth care what happens to me? 
During the plague, they cursed my 
name because I invented the star- 
engines. That's the only time Earth 
remembered me." 

"During the plague, men were 
insane, Jan," Hubbard said, know- 
ing his own sweet reasonableness 
was ludicrous under the circum- 
stances, "not responsible for what 
they said. They don't curse your 
name any more." 

"No, they've forgotten it." Em- 
rys looked at Hubbard with blaz- 
ing, unhuman eyes. "Why should 
you expect me to put their welfare 
before my own?" 

"You must, if the race is to sur- 
vive." 

Hubbard expected Emrys to 
say, "Why should it survive?" but 
apparently there was a grain of 
emotion left here. "It will survive. 
The Morethans are not—" the word 
seemed to stick in Emrys' throat 
—"monsters." 

"Jan," Hubbard said in a mono- 
tone, "eleven years ago, after you 
came to Earth for your inheri- 
tance, I became interested in More- 
this — naturally enough, I suppose. 
I started scanning everything I 
could lay my hands on, and I 
learned a great deal about it — 
as much, I believe, as anyone off 
Morethis knows. Except, of course, 
you." 

Emrys rose and began to pace 



36 




 



the floor. "Nobody really knows 
anything about Morethis. Most of 
what has been written is a— a pack 
of lies. One liar copied from an- 
other, and so they perpetuate the 
lie. Scandal has always sold better 
than truth!" 

Hubbard said, "There is a legend 
that the Morethans once had lim- 
ited space travel, though no way 
of warping space to bring the dis- 
tant stars closer, since they did 
not use engines. But there were 
many stars close to them, and they 
traveled from system to system, 
sucking each one dry. Then there 
were no living planets left in their 
sector of space, and their engine- 
less ships could not bridge the gap 
to the next cluster, so they found 
themselves trapped on a dying 
planet that revolved around a dy- 
ing star, and they, as a race, began 
to die themselves" 

Emrys tried to laugh. "Looks 
like a fine case of poetic justice, 
but-" 

"Wait. I haven't finished. The 
race did not die completely; it de- 
cayed. Certain among the people 
stayed alive through sucking the 
lives of the others; certain among 
them still kept some vestiges of the 
old traditions and knowledge; cer- 
tain among them waited." 

"Is that the end of your story?" 

Hubbard nodded. Emrys' face 
was ashen. "Well, it's an old wives' 
tale," he sputtered. "All the More- 
thans want is to be able to com- 



pete on an equal basis with Earth. 
They don't want to be exploited, 
nor do they intend to . . ." As his 
eyes caught Hubbard's, his voice 
trailed off. "Anyhow, I'll be dead," 
he said. "I don't give a damn what 
happens after I'm dead." 

TTUBBARD didn't believe it. He 
•*-■*• couldn't There is no man 
who has not some love for his own 
kind, be it ever so little, merely 
because they look like him. 

"You won't tell anybody who I 
really am?" Emrys asked childish- 
ly. "You're still my friend, aren't 
you?" 

Hubbard sighed. Was he still 
this creature's friend? He didn't 
know. "Who would believe me?" 
he finally asked. "And even if they 
did, whafs the use? Nothing can 
be done. The only thing that's ever 
protected us from the Morethans 
is distance. When they reach Earth, 
they will have already conquered 
us. Mental powers are always 
stronger than physical powers at 
close range." 

"That's right." Emrys seemed to 
be relieved at the idea that the 
question was out of his hands. "Too 
late now to do anything about it." 

Hubbard nodded. There was no 
way out that he could see. 

"But you do promise not to tell 
old Dyall that I'm my father in- 
stead of me?" Emrys asked anx- 
iously. 

"Even if he believed me, he 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



37 






wouldn't care. All he wants is a 
good match for that great-great- 
granddaughter of his." 

But was that all? As far as 
money went, Nicholas Dyall was 
reputed to be the richest man 
alive. And if he was truly fond of 
the girl, would he not at least have 
investigated the young man? 

"You're hard!" Emrys com- 
plained, but without rancor. 

"I have a suspicious nature," 
Hubbard said thoughtfully. "Per- 
haps it's the legal mind. At any 
rate, I don't care for Nicholas 
Dyall." 

"Well, I don't either, but I don't 
really give a hang what kind of 
a great-great-grandf ather-in-law I'm 
getting. All I care about is Megan. 
Do you think it's wrong for me to 
ask her to marry me?" 

"Can't you understand that, at 
this stage, the girl doesn't mat- 
ter?" 

"No," Emrys said simply. "I 
cannot imagine her not matter- 
ing." 

After he had gone, Hubbard 
still found himself thinking about 
Nicholas Dyall. In his whole life- 
time, the old lawyer had personal- 



ly known only two men whom so- 
ciety had deemed worthy of its 
highest honor, the longevity treat- 
ment. And these were more than 
most men had met, for the longevi- 
ty treatment was given to very 
few. Both of the two, Dyall and 
Shortmire, had some defect in their 
personalities that warped them— 
all but completely, in Shortmire's 
case — away from the human vir- 
tues. 

Was that defect a part of the 
creative talent that had earned the 
individual his right to the treat- 
ment? Or did it arise as an effect 
of the treatment itself? Because, 
if that was the case, then Earth's 
longevity treatment might be 
nothing more than a primitive 
form of the Morethan "process." 

Since only straws remained to 
be grasped at, no one thing Hub- 
bard did would be more futile than 
any other. And since he had noth- 
ing better to do, he might just as 
well investigate this new avenue. 
Jan Shortmire had hated Nicholas 
Dyall. Had Nicholas Dyall hated 
Jan Shortmire with equal venom? 
And, if so, had he done anything 
about it? 



VII 



A GONG sounded and a me- 
■£*■ chanical voice announced, 
"Mr. Peter Hubbard to see Mr. 
Dyall and Mr. Shortmire." 

"Do you mean to say he has 



the gall to come see us, after the 
accusations he made against you, 
Emrys?" Dyall demanded incredu- 
lously. "I still can't understand 
why you sent him an invitation to 



38 




 



the wedding, but that he should 
make a casual social call . . .!" 

"We've come to terms." Emrys 
smiled. "After all, at his age, he 
can't be held accountable for every- 
thing he says." 

"I'm at least fifty years older 
than he is!" the old engineer al- 
most spat. "And you — do you 
mean that I am not responsible for 
what I say?" 

Knowing that he was the other 
man's senior by some twenty years 
himself, Emrys was malevolently 
pleased. "Some people retain their 
faculties longer than others," he ob- 
served. "And Hubbard was my 
father's friend, as well as his law- 
yer, so he's the closest thing to a 
relative that I have on Earth. Ex- 
cept you, of course; you were my 
father's friend, too." 

DyalPs lips tightened. "How 
does Hubbard know you're in this 
house right now? Do you think 
he's having you followed?" 

It was possible, but Emrys 
didn't care. For almost a year now, 
his life had been blameless, and, 
strangely, it suited him to live that 
way. "I'm here in this house most 
of the time. It wouldn't be hard for 
him to figure out where he could 
find me." 

The gong sounded again. Dyall 
looked undecided. 

"If / can forgive him, sir," Emrys 
said gently, "surely you can." 

"Show him in," Dyall rasped 
to the machine. 



Megan rose to go, but Emrys 
kept hold of her small, cold hand. 
"I'd like you to meet Peter Hub- 
bard, dear. He's really a nice old 
fellow when you get to know him. 
Just a bit too much of a do-gooder, 
that's all." 

Dyall snorted. 

"I shall be glad to know any 
friend of yours, Emrys," Megan 
said, sitting down again obediently. 

After a moment, Peter Hubbard 
came into the room. "Peter, this 
is my fiancee, Megan Dyall." Smil- 
ingly, Emrys waited for the usual 
inane felicitations. He couldn't ex- 
pect a man of Hubbard's age to 
be bowled over by this loveliness, 
but still surely no man, no matter 
how ancient, could be completely 
insensible to the girl's charm. 

Hubbard stood still and stared 
at her. "Amazing . . ." he mur- 
mured. "Amazing . . ." Then he 
turned to Dyall. "You are to be 
congratulated, sir." 

Emrys was annoyed. He knew 
Hubbard was too well-bred to 
make a remark like that uninten- 
tionally. However, he pretended to 
be amused and said, "You're sup- 
posed to congratulate me, Peter." 

But Hubbard continued his in- 
explicable rudeness by paying no 
attention to Emrys and, instead, 
staring at Nicholas Dyall. And fi- 
nally Dyall said, with a strangled 
laugh, "I think perhaps in this in- 
stance Mr. Hubbard is right." 

He threw himself into an easy 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



39 









chair with an attempt at non- 
chalance, but it was embarrassing- 
ly apparent that his stick was not 
enough to support him any more. 
His old body was trembling. And 
Emrys found that he himself was 
trembling, too. 

r jPHERE was a painful silence. 
•*■ Everyone seemed to be wait- 
ing. Even Megan glanced from one 
to the other with her usual expres- 
sion of bright-eyed interest. 

"Unfortunately, Mr. Hubbard," 
Dyall said at last, "youVe reached 
your conclusions too late to do 
anything except perhaps hasten an 
end that is, you'll concede, by now 
inevitable." 

"Yes," Hubbard agreed, "youVe 
won your game." He came a little 
further into the room, so that he 
was standing over the other old 
man. "I do believe that, of the 
two, you are the worse. He did 
what he did out of spite. You 
created that spite and kept it 
alive." 

DyalFs dark face flushed and 
his hands tightened on his cane. 
"But I had a right to do what I 
did. And I hurt only one person. 
Two, if you include me. Give me 
credit, at least, for the smallness 
of my scope." 

Hubbard glanced at Megan. 
And Dyall broke into the shrill 
cackle of an old man. "But you 
know, you know, and still you 
think of her! How sentimental can 



you get? Don't you realize—" 

"How much does she?" Hubbard 
said. "How much do you?" 

Emrys had become nearly fran- 
tic with frustration and bewilder- 
ment. He was the one who had 
secrets; nobody else. Nothing was 
to be kept hidden from him! "What 
are you two blabbering about?" 
he almost screamed. "It doesn't 
make sense — any of it!" 

Hubbard turned toward him, his 
head and neck moving with the 
deliberate precision of a piece of 
clockwork. "It makes very good 
sense, Jan. I realized that I could 
find out nothing more from the 
stars, so I turned my researches 
back to Earth. I've been investigat- 
ing Mr. Dyall." 

"What did you find?" Emrys 
asked tensely. Why did Peter call 
him by his former name in front 
of his former enemy? Had the old 
fool forgotten his promise, or had 
he broken it on purpose? "What 
did you find out?" he repeated. 

Hubbard's voice was filled with 
pity. "Just this: Nicholas Dyall 
never did marry Alissa Embel." 

Emrys' fear exploded into a 
scarlet rage. "Then Megan is—" He 
advanced on Dyall, his fists 
clenched. "If you took Alissa and 
then didn't-" 

Hubbard caught his arm in a 
frail grip. "Don't be so hasty, Em- 
rys. Dyall did no wrong to Alissa 
Embel, whatever wrong he may 
have done to you." 



40 




 



"Thank you," Dyall murmured, 
"for granting me that. I gave her 
all I had, but it wasn't what she 
wanted. She wanted—" his old eyes 
were filled with hate as he looked 
at Emrys— "you." 

"Alissa Embel killed herself on 
the day before the wedding," Hub- 
bard told Emrys. "She, as we at- 
torneys say, died without issue." 

Tf MRYS was glad that, since he 
-*-^ could not have had Alissa, 
Dyall had not, either. At the same 
time, he felt an overwhelmingly 
poignant sense of sorrow, that he 
should have had three full life- 
times, and the woman he had loved 
—insofar as Jan Shortmire had 
been capable of love — not even 
one. 

He raised dull eyes to the two 
old men. "Then who is Megan?" 

Hubbard hesitated. But what 
worse could there be to tell? And 
then the lawyer asked a ridicu- 
lous question, "Jan, do you know 
why Dyall's machines didn't meet 
popular favor until he changed 
them?" 

Emrys plunged back once again 
into the well of his memories. "No- 
body wanted to buy machines that 
looked too much like people; it 
made them . . . uncomfortable. So 
Dyall stopped designing robots 
and made machines adapted to 
their separate functions and—" His 
voice became a cry of anguish. 
"Megan!" 



She turned her bland, smiling 
doll face toward him. "I'm sorry, 
Emrys," the sweet voice said. 

Dyall's eyes were squeezed shut 
and something glistened on the 
edge of them— something that Em- 
rys would not admit were tears, 
because he himself could never 
cry. 

"When Alissa died," Dyall said, 
"I knew I couldn't love another 
woman. So I made a mechanical 
doll in her image. I made her the 
woman every man dreams of — 
lovely and sympathetic and unde- 
manding. And I told myself she 
would be better than the original 
Alissa because she would be per- 
fect, and Alissa wasn't; she would 
stay young forever, while the real 
Alissa would have grown old . . . 
if she had lived. But it wasn't the 
same for me." 

Why was she the same for me, 
then? Emrys wondered bitterly. 
Was it because I didn't know? Is 
that all love is — self-deception? 

"Perhaps," Dyall went on, "Man 
cannot appreciate true perfection; 
perhaps he's not good enough him- 
self. Still, she was company of a 
sort and so I kept her by me. And 
then, when I read of Emrys Short- 
mire's arrival on Earth, I sent him 
a note, but he didn't answer; how- 
ever, I contrived to get a look at 
him anyway. Then I knew for 
sure that he was Jan Shortmire 
himself; and then I knew what 
Megan's destiny was . . ." 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



41 








"How could you know he — I 
was Jan Shortmire?" Emrys de- 
manded angrily. It was insupport- 
able that old Dyall should have 
known all along; it spoiled the 
joke. "Where would you have — 
have gotten the concept?" 

The old man smiled, opening his 
eyes. "Because the Morethans 
made me the same offer they did 
you! Did you think you were the 
only one?" And, throwing back 
his head, he derisively began to 
laugh aloud.

1VT ORE than ever, Emrys hated 
*■**• the Morethans, not for what 
they would do to Earth's pride, 
but for what they had done to 
his. Because now there was noth- 
ing that he had been offered that 
Dyall had not been offered also. 
And Dyall had not accepted the 
Morethans* offer, thereby proving 
himself the better man. And Dyall 
had tricked him, thereby proving 
himself the cleverer man. And 
Dyall had hated him even more 
than he had hated Dyall, thereby 



42 




 




proving himself the more constant 
man. So there Emrys Shortmire, 
Jan Shortmire, was left . . . with 
nothing but a youthfulness of 
which, he had to admit to himself, 
he had grown rather tired. 

"I'm sorry, Emrys," Megan said. 
"I'm terribly sorry." 

Dyall sprang from his chair. "I'm 
sick of that piping doll's voice of 
yours! I've stood it for a century, 
and that's long enough!" Raising 
his stick high in the air, he crashed 
it down upon the golden head, the 



pretty pink and white face. And, 
frozen in horror, Emrys could not 
move until it was too late. He had 
not conceived old Dyall capable of 
committing outright murder so 
wantonly. Probably he wasn't; to 
him, Megan was and had been al- 
ways a doll. 

And now she was a heap of 
broken wheels and gears on the 
thick rug. Still, out of the heap of 
twisted machinery, a tiny, tinny 
voice kept repeating "I'm sorry, 
Emrys. I'm terribly sorry." 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



43 






Exhausted by his effort, Dyall 
sank back into his chair. And he 
laughed as Emrys, wanting des- 
perately to weep, unable to, bent 
over the pieces, trying to fit them 
together again. 

"You'll never do it, Jan," he 
croaked maliciously. "Even a good 
engineer would never be able to 
repair it now. If I know how to 
create, I also know how to destroy!" 
And he went into another paroxysm 



of gleefully triumphant laughter. 

Emrys saw that Megan was in- 
deed far beyond his powers, and 
probably old Dyall's, to repair. 
Filled with fury — the one emotion, 
he saw now, that he had not given 
up — he turned to smash Nicholas 
Dyall as Dyall had smashed his 
doll. But the old, old man sat per- 
fectly still in his chair. There was 
a broad grin on his face. 

He made a very cheerful corpse.

TC^MRYS Shortmire found that 
•*-^ he did not want life any more. 
He went back to his mansion and 
he tried to hang himself. But the 
rope would not cut off his breath. 
He pointed a ray gun at his head, 
and although the heat became in- 
tolerable, it did not burn him. He 
swallowed poison and waited. 
Nothing happened. He threw him- 
self off the roof and landed un- 
hurt upon the pavement below. He 
went back inside and slashed his 
writst and saw the cuts close be- 
fore his eyes. And as he stared at 
the unmarked skin, thick fog filled 
the room, and he heard Uvrei's 
voice — and it was the greatest 
ignominy of all that the More- 
than's voice should dare to hold 
compassion. 

"Don't you know, Emrys, that 
an immortal cannot die?" 

When Emrys forced himself to 
look at the ancient one, he saw 



that the beautiful eyes were filled 
with an unhallowed pity. "You 
are an immortal god, son of my 
spirit You can destroy anything 
except one of us — and you are 
one of us now." 

"I'm not one of you. I'm not a 
god, nor are you. I'm not . . ." 
Emrys looked down at his wrists, 
then back at Uvrei. "But I may 
be immortal," he acknowledged. 
"It wasn't just a figure of speech?" 

"You will never die, Emrys. 
You will exist forever, like us, a 
handful of changelessness in a 
changing universe." 

"Then I won't be dead when 
you come to Earth?" He had fan- 
cied himself out of it, but what 
exquisite punishment that not until 
he had tired of life had he found 
out he was cursed with unwanted 
life forever. He had not been a 
good man, but was any man evil 
enough to deserve this? 




 



"When we come to Earth, you 
will be waiting for us. But you will 
look forward to our coming." And 
Uvrei said once again, "You are 
one of us, Emrys." 

"I'm not! I'm not!" 

"Of course you are. Like us, you 
do not breathe air—" 

"I do . . ." And then Emrys re- 
membered that the rope had not 
cut off his breath, and it might well 
have been because he had not been 
breathing. 

"Like us, you do not eat food." 

"But I do!" And here Emrys was 
genuinely perplexed. 

"We left you your digestive sys- 
tem, because part of the pleasure 
you craved comes through that. 
But you could completely deny 
yourself the food that you thought 
sustained you and feel no ill effects 
— at least no physical ones. It's 
the pills that feed you, Emrys." 

"Well," Emrys said slowly, 
"they're food, then." 

"Of a sort. But not the kind you 
mean. You cannot exist without us 
and our skills, Emrys. Each vial 
of pills consists of the mitogenetic 
force of ten tons of life." 

"What kind of life?" Emrys 
asked. 

"Does it really matter?" 

"You said I cannot exist with- 
out you," Emrys pointed out 
shrewdly, "that I need the pills. 
So I could stop taking them, 
couldn't I, and starve myself to 
death?" 



TVREI smiled. "Yes, you could 
^ do that. Only it would take, 
say, about fifteen hundred terres- 
trial years — perhaps, since we 
have given you a strong, young 
body, as much as two thousand. 
Do you think you are strong 
enough to starve yourself to death 
over a period of two thousand 
years?" 

Emrys knew he was not. In that 
first anguish, all he could think of 
to do was to humble himself be- 
fore the Morethan. "I have served 
your purpose. Why not be merci- 
ful to me now?" he pleaded. "At 
least let me die." 

"I could not, even if I would. So 
little of our old powers remain. We 
have kept the secret of perpetual 
life, but we have lost the secret of 
perpetual death." 

"But that's the greater secret!" 

"Of course it is!" For the first 
time, Emrys saw the Morethan 
high priest lose control. "Do you 
think I don't know what it is to 
crave death?" 

After a silence, the voice, once 
more chillingly warm, said, "Come, 
my son, being one of us, you have 
nothing to fear from our arrival. 
You no longer have anything in 
common with these animals. You 
cannot even — what is your word? 
— love them. When you tried, you 
fixed upon a machine with the 
face of a memory." 

"Would a human being have 
known she was a machine?" 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



45 






"A human being would have 
known." 

"Then ... I am a machine, too? 
A machine created by mental, 
rather than physical processes, but 
a machine nonetheless? " 

"In a sense," the alien said 
thoughtfully, "you could be called 
that — though to compare you, as 
an artistic creation, with that 
trumpery piece of gimcrack . . ." 

'Don't call her that!" Emrys 
shouted. "She's dead!" 

Uvrei began to laugh quietly. 
After a little, Emrys began to 
laugh, too. "I'm being foolish," he 
said. 

"Extremely foolish," Uvrei 
agreed. "Resign yourself, my son, 
and accept your fate. That is what 
we immortals have all had to do, 
one by one." 

Of course he could do that, Em- 
rys thought. After all, he wouldn't 
be as badly off as the other Earth 
people when the Morethans came; 



whatever else happened, he, at 
least, could not be turned into a 
component part of a little golden 
pill. Immortality was a dull future, 
but perhaps, after the Morethans 
arrived, it would become more in- 
teresting. 

"Good-by, son of my spirit," 
Uvrei said. "We shall meet again 
corporeally in a few centuries." 
The fog thickened about him and 
disappeared, leaving its characteris- 
tic odor behind. 

And still Emrys could not re- 
sign himself. Dyall could have had 
this, too, if he had wanted it This 
was what he was offered and what 
he was strong enough to refuse. 
If I accept my fate, then I will 
always know that I have come off 
second best to him. And this pros- 
pect, more than immortality, more 
than the knowledge of what would 
happen to Earth and its people, 
was the one that Emrys found in- 
tolerable.

TJP7H Y doesn't he leave me alone? 
™ Peter Hubbard thought, as, 
wearily, he told the Dyall machine 
to let Emrys Shortmire up. / am 
a very old man and I will die 
soon. Can't he leave me alone in 
the little time left? 

But he could not forget the obli- 
gations of courtesy. He was polite 
to Emrys Shortmire when the 
other man came in. Even if he 



hadn't been, he saw, Emrys 
wouldn't have noticed; he was too 
full of his own thoughts. 

"Peter," he cried, almost before 
he was fully in the room, "did you 
know that, in dying, Nicholas 
Dyall won a final victory over 
me?" 

The old man muffled a yawn. 
"You mean you can't die? Well, 
I was afraid of that. I am sorry 



46 




 






for you, Jan, but you brought this 
upon yourself." 

"I know," Emrys said, looking a 
little disappointed that the knowl- 
edge did not startle the lawyer. 
"I will be alive when they come," 
he went on, more subdued. "I will 
be waiting, or so they think." 

"I imagine that's what they 
counted on," Hubbard said indif- 
ferently. "You not only giving 
them the secret of the engines but 
acting as a — an outpost. They 
didn't sell their wares cheap, did 
they?" 

Emrys' eyes flashed copper fire. 
"But I will not be waiting to help 
them. I will be waiting to fight 
them." 

"Brave words." 

"You think I can't fight them?" 

"Of course you can't. They have 
powers far beyond yours. And why 
should you want to fight them? 
I know you hadn't planned to be 
alive when they came, but it won't 
be bad for you. You're one of 
them now." 

Emrys sat down on the couch. 
"Physically I am. That's why I can 
fight them. Look, Peter, I have 
centuries ahead of me. By giving 
me immortality, they have also 
given me time." 

"Splendid. Time to do what?" 

"I don't know," Emrys con- 
fessed. "But time is such a valu- 
able commodity in itself. With it, 
I could learn how to turn their own 
powers against them." 



"Easier said than done," Hub- 
bard observed. 

"Maybe I could — oh — invent 
a machine that will amplify my 
mind powers until it can overcome 
all of theirs . . ." 

Hubbard said nothing. 

"Well, then, the engines I gave 
them can't take them out of this 
galaxy any more than those same 
engines can take humanity out of 
it. But, given time, I can invent 
new engines, Peter — engines that 
can jump the gap from galaxy to 
galaxy. If I cannot give Man the 
weapons with which to fight, at 
least I can give him the means by 
which to flee! And, since I was 
the man who invented the one, I 
can be the man to invent the 
other!" 

THAT was true, Hubbard 
thought, hope rising in him, 
despite all his efforts to hold it 
back. That was possible. But would 
Emrys do this? Right now, in the 
first flush of repentance, he might 
try to. But if the work grew tedi- 
ous, might he not say to himself: 
Why bother? I'm bound to live 
forever, anyway. Why should I 
care what happens to the others 
of my kind? 

"Who knows, Peter," Emrys 
cried, "I may be able to invent en- 
gines that can move the whole 
world — all our worlds — to an- 
other galaxy, where the Morethans 
will never be able to follow!" 



NEVER COME MIDNIGHT 



47 






"What's in it for you, Emrys?" 
Hubbard asked bluntly. 

"I want to save humanity . . . 
and, of course," Emrys added, his 
eyes lighting exultantly, "by doing 
that, I will do more than Dyall 
ever did. My name will go down in 
history, and his—" 

"Do you hate him so much, 
Emrys, even though he's dead?" 
Hubbard asked wonderingly, un- 
able to conceive of such a thing. 

"Especially because he's dead," 
Emrys snarled. "Because now I'll 
never have the pleasure of mocking 
him." He looked anxiously at Hub- 
bard. "Don't you think I'm doing 
the right thing, Peter?" 

The right thing, but for the 
wrong reason. Only for the wrong 
reason, though, was Emrys sure to 
finish what he had set out to do. 
It was the one motive that would 
keep him working long after he 
grew bored with the work. It was 
humanity's only chance, and so it 
did not matter why Emrys was 
doing this. 



"Ifs a splendid thing you're 
planning to do, Emrys," Hubbard 
said warmly. "A splendid thing!" 

What if Emrys did go down in 
history? It would be thanks to 
him that history had continued at 
all. 

VES, he was a vicious man. And 
■*- Dyall had been equally vicious. 
And Peter Hubbard was a good 
man — and it was he who had not 
been granted that fifty extra years 
of life. What was goodness? Was 
it inherently opposed to greatness? 
Did things get done only out of 
malevolent motives — anger and 
ruthlessness and spite? If, as it 
seemed, goodness was a passive 
force, and evil an active one, per- 
haps the world needed both. And 
if, as it seemed, evil could beget 
good, then evil could not be all 
bad. 

So, Peter Hubbard thought, 
there is hope for the Morethans as 
well as for humanity.

Remnants off the 

Sarmatlan Sea 

BY WILLY LEY 

SINCE this piece is going to 
deal with a distant place as 
well as, intermittently, a dis- 
tant past, it might as well begin in 
the past and with the description 
of a voyage. I cannot lay my hands 
on an authentic document for this

voyage— although it has been made 
repeatedly — and I therefore im- 
agine a Roman traveler of about 
200 B.C. sitting on a terrace of his 
villa on a hilltop some distance 
from Rome. Shivering a little in an 
entirely unseasonal wind, he dic- 
tates to his scribe: 

"Cnossus on Creta was directly 
to the south of us when we shifted 
to a northern course to wend our 
way through the channels between 
the Cyclades into Aegaeum Mare. 
Turning east again when Lemnos 
came into sight, we entered the 
Hellespontus and, after traversing 
the Propontis, turned north into 
the narrow Bosporus Thracicus, 
where the opposing current is 
strong. Once we had gained the 
open waters of the Pontus Euxinus, 
we had a smooth if long voyage 
and finally found the entrance to 
Maeotis palus, which entrance 
some call the Bosporus cimmeri- 
cus. Maeotis palus is not a swamp 
(palus) but again open water, if 
shallow. The climate was warm 
and pleasing as one might have it 
in Sicilia. 

"Then we found the mouth of 
the river Tanais and sailed up- 
stream. But after a two-day jour- 
ney on the Tanais, we had to leave 
our vessel and had to proceed 
overland to reach the mighty 
Oarus, which makes a big bend 
there. In a small village at the 
bend, we found a barbarian who 
could speak some Greek and who 

60 



told us that the sea to the south 
of us could best be reached by 
building a raft such as Odysseus 
used when leaving Kalypso's is- 
land, and by simply drifting down 
the Oarus until we reached its 
delta and through it, with luck, 
the Mare Caspium . . ." 

r | 1 HE description is not at all 
■■• strange. I have merely used 
the geographical names of the 
period. The Propontis is our Sea 
of Marmara, the Pontus Euxinus 
is the Black Sea, the Bosporus 
cimmericus is the Strait of 
Kertch, and the Maeotis palus the 
Sea of Azov. The Tanais is ob- 
viously the Don and the Oarus the 
Volga. The Mare Caspium is still 
the Caspian Sea in any language 
and it is, now as then, the largest 
land-locked body of water. It is 
also something that worries the 
Russians. The reason why it wor- 
ries the Russians is far in the 
past, in a past far beyond Romans 
and Greeks and Scythians. It is 
in the geologic past. . 

A fair number of millions of 
years ago, before the Alps formed, 
Europe was bounded in the south 
— and separated from Africa — 
by a large sea. 

The description sounds as if our 
current Mediterranean Sea were 
meant, but this was a far bigger 
sea. It covered the area now cov- 
ered by the Mediterranean Sea, 
but in the north it covered land 


 



even beyond the present-day Alps. 
In the east, it made a straight con- 
nection with the Indian Ocean. 
Geologists call it the Tethys Sea; 
it had been there much longer than 
even the oldest mammals. It had 
been there in the days of the 
Saurians; in fact, it had been a fix- 
ture on the face of the Earth for 
literally hundreds of millions of 
years. 

It probably was fairly shallow 
in great stretches of the area it 
covered. But it was there; we can 
read its former existence from the 
fossils of marine life it left be- 
hind. It formed an uninterrupted 
waterway from the Atlantic to the 
Indian Ocean until about the mid- 
dle of the Tertiary Period, say 
twenty million years ago. 

The growing Alps at first formed 
just an island in the Tethys Sea, 
but in the east the connection to 
the Indian Ocean was broken. For 
a while, several million years, Af- 
rica and Asia were firmly con- 
nected by a land bridge 1200 miles 
wide, the land bridge we now call 
Arabia. Only at a later date did 
an enormous valley open in that 
land connection, the Great Rift 
Valley which in its northern por- 
tion forms the Valley of the Jor- 
dan, which farther south is flooded 
to form the Red Sea and which, 
still farther south, is the reason for 
Africa's "long lakes" - Albert, Ed- 
ward, Kivu, Tanganyika and 
Nyasa. 



In the north, the Tethys broke 
up into several big "seas." One 
we now call the western Mediter- 
ranean. The eastern Mediterranean 
was a smaller and separate sea, 
and still farther to the east there 
was one which no longer exists as 
a unit. It was the Sarmatian Sea 
(Fig. 1) which unified the pres- 
ent Black Sea with the present 
Caspian Sea and the present Lake 
Aral over 200 miles to the east 
of the Caspian Sea. 

But the Sarmatian Sea extended 
much farther to the north than any 
of its three remnants of today. It 
also extended much farther to the 
west. There is evidence that the 
Hungarian plain was once covered 
by the waters of the Sarmatian 
Sea. But since much of it must 
have been shallow, there obvious- 
ly were large-scale fluctuations in 
its extent. 

It must have been rather simi- 
lar to the performance of present 
Lake Tchad in Africa — also the 
remnant of a former much larger 
"sea" — for which every survey 
gives a different area. All the sur- 
veys are, as far as one can tell, 
correct. It just depends on how 
wet the preceding seasons were. 

IT is not yet known — although 
-■■ Soviet geologists are probably 
busy trying to establish this fact 
— just how the Sarmatian Sea 
fared during the Ice Age. Actually, 
we don't even know yet how far

south the glaciers of the Ice Age— • 
or, better, the Ice Ages — reached 
in Russia. At any event, the area 
of the sea must have increased 
again at the end of the last glacia- 
tion, when a lot of the water that 
had been stored as ice and snow 
was put back into circulation. 

Much of the question on the 
area of the Sarmatian Sea depends 
on the time when its western com- 
ponent, the present Black Sea, fi- 
nally succeeded in breaking 
through to the Mediterranean. 

It has to be mentioned in pass- 
ing that the Mediterranean Sea is 
forever losing water. Being a large 



sea in a warm climate, the water 
losses of the Mediterranean Sea to 
evaporation are more than merely 
astonishing; they are estimated to 
amount to 5,420,000 million cubic 
yards per year. 

Rain over the Mediterranean re- 
places about 24 per cent of this 
loss. The rivers that empty them- 
selves into the Mediterranean 
make up only about 5*/2 per cent 
of this. The Atlantic Ocean con- 
tributes the main share of compen- 
sation for the evaporation losses, 
nearly 67 per cent. The rest, 
roughly 3V2 per cent, is contrib- 
uted by the Black Sea. 



62 




 



The Sarmatian Sea, as a whole, 
probably disappeared when drain- 
age into the thirsty Mediterranean 
was accomplished, leaving water 
in only the three deepest depres- 
sions of its area. 

Of these three depressions, the 
westernmost, the Black Sea, is 
doing relatively well, as can be 
seen from the fact that it still sup- 
plies water to the Mediterranean. 

The easternmost of the three, 
Lake Aral, is also in good shape. 
With an area of 26,200 square 
miles, it is slightly larger than Lake 
Victoria in Africa, which it re- 
sembles in shape. Its level is now 
158 feet above sea level and its 
maximum measured depth is 222 
feet. Its area seems to have been 
stable for centuries, its level having 
risen a little only during the last 
fifty years. 

Of course, if an earthquake 
opened a chasm in a westerly di- 
rection leading to the depression of 
the Caspian Sea, the lake that 
would be left would have little re- 
semblance to "blue Lake Aral" 
of today. The figure of 222 feet 
which has been mentioned is the 
maximum measured depth. The 
average depth is somewhere be- 
tween 55 and 65 feet; if a drain- 
age to about sea level were opened, 
very little would be left of it. 

"OUT if one could say that the 
■" Black Sea is "doing well" and 
that Lake Aral is "getting along" 



no such statement can be made 
about the central depression of the 
old Sarmatian Sea, the Caspian 
Sea (Fig. 2). It is in a sorry shape 
and both Nature and Man are 
combining to make it sorrier still. 
Its level is by now 96 feet below 
sea level and still sinking. 

Even with these handicaps, it is 
still the largest "lake," if you use 
that term to denote a body of 
water not connected with the 
oceans. If saltiness is the criterion 
used, the Caspian is a "sea"— the 
average figure for the whole Cas- 
pian reads 6.3 grams of salt per 
liter of water. (For the Atlantic 
Ocean, the figure is 35 grams per 
liter.) 

In reality, the "average" salti- 
ness does not apply. In the north, 
say north of the 45th parallel, the 
water is drinkable. Logically it is 
more salty than the average in the 
south. And the bay of Kara-Bogaz- 
Gol is a very special case which 
needs separate description. 

The dimensions of the Caspian 
are impressive enough — from 
north to south, it stretches very 
nearly 800 miles; the widest part 
measures 275 miles across. The 
area is about 169,000 square 
miles; a more precise figure can- 
not be given, even aside from the 
perennial question of whether the 
area of islands in a lake should be 
counted as lake area or should be 
subtracted from it. 

About two-thirds of the area of 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



63 



the Caspian Sea is deeper than 
600 feet, and two-thirds of the 
deep section lie in the southern- 
most part, to the south of the line 
from Baku to Krasnovodsk. The 
third city of noticeable size, in 
addition to the two just mentioned, 
is Astrakhan in the north, near the 
delta of the Volga. 

The water supply of the Cas- 
pian Sea comes from two major 
rivers, the Volga and the Ural, and 
five minor ones, Emba, Kuma, 
Terek, Kura and Araxel. Of the 
minor rivers, the Terek looks 
major in late spring, when it is 
swollen by the melting snows of 
the Caucasus. Altogether, they 
pour 175 cubic miles of water into 
the Caspian every year — the 
Volga is Europe's largest river — 
but this makes up for the losses 
only in very wet years. 

The Caspian, like the Mediter- 
ranean, lies in a warm (most of 
the time) and dry (almost all of 
the time) climate. Dry winds come 
from Asia in the east and the 
evaporation rate is equal to the 
influx, even though the annual in- 
flux represents the volume of Lake 
Erie. 

ONE of the main reasons for the 
loss is the strange bay, the 
Kara-Bogaz-Gol. Its area is about 
7100 square miles — for compari- 
son: the area of Lake Ontario is 
7540 square miles — with a maxi- 
mum depth of 40 feet and an aver- 



age depth of about 5 feet. 

The channel connecting the bay 
with the Caspian is roughly one 
mile in length and not much over 
400 feet wide on the average. 
Through this channel pass 22,000 
cubic feet of water per second, to 
be evaporated in this natural salt 
pan. 

Since the minerals carried into 
the bay return into the Caspian to 
the same extent as the water which 
carried them, namely not at all, the 
overall result is that the general 
salinity of the Caspian is kept 
rather low and that of the bay is 
fantastic. An estimated 1000 mil- 
lion tons of minerals, impure Ep- 
som salts, to be specific, cover the 
bottom of the bay, in places to a 
depth of seven feet. 

If this does not sound quite 
credible, I can add another equal- 
ly surprising fact: in the bay of 
Krasnovodsk, just south of the 
Epsom salts bay, the inhabitants 
often hunt seals! 

In the north, the fisheries are 
somewhat more on the conserva- 
tive side. There the fishermen 
catch salmon, herring and sturgeon. 
The catch of the latter - 90 per 
cent of all sturgeon are caught in 
the Caspian — has a decisive bear- 
ing on the caviar trade. 

But it is just this caviar corner 
of the Caspian which is shrink- 
ing at a literally visible rate. Most 
of the small fishing towns are now 
miles from the shore. And even

though each foot of recession pro- 
duces nearly 100,000 acres of 
arable land, the overall picture re- 
sults in a loss. The Soviets say that 
the Caspian Sea now costs them 
a billion rubles per year, and they 
have a truly capitalistic concern 
about losing money. 

Part of the shrinkage is due, 
strangely enough, to the main 
water supplier of the Caspian, the 
Volga. From more than two hun- 
dred mouths, the Volga pours 
about four times as much water 
into the Caspian Sea as all the 
other rivers taken together. But 
with the water come 55 million 
cubic feet of sediments annually; 
more, if the spring flood of the 
Volga was exceptionally high. This 
makes the northern section, the 
fishing grounds, more shallow. For 
many years, steamers were aware 
of the fact that they had to lighten 
cargo if they wished to pass the 
Volga delta at a distance closer 
than 40 miles. 

What makes the 55 million 
cubic feet of sediment even more 
deplorable to Russian economists 
is that a large percentage of it 
once was good topsoil along the 
river's course. Whatever good land 
may be gained from the Caspian's 
recession had simply been lost 
elsewhere at an earlier time. 

so 






HP HAT this recession is to some 
•*- extent man-made is also no con- 
solation. For quite a number of 

66 



years, the Russians have been 
building dams along the Volga, 
partly for regulating the flow of 
the river itself, partly for the gen- 
eration of electric current. They 
have created half a dozen large ar- 
tificial lakes, all full of Volga 
water. The largest of them, the ar- 
tificial lake near Kuibyshev, has an 
area of 1900 square miles and re- 
quired all of the spring flood of 
1957 to fill it up. 

It must be added that the Volga 
itself, in its lower portion, loses a 
great deal of water to evaporation, 
and the artificial lakes, naturally, 
show evaporation losses too. Even 
if, when all the power-generating 
units finally are in operation, the 
Volga water will finally reach the 
Caspian Sea, it has to be less than 
would reach the sea in the time 
of our fictitious Roman traveler. 

The facts about the Caspian 
Sea are, then, as follows: 

Up to 1900, the rate of supply 
from the rivers, especially the 
Volga, was not quite enough to 
make up the evaporation losses. 
The oldest level of the Caspian 
Sea in historical times that could 
be established with reasonable cer- 
tainty was during the fourteenth 
century; it was then roughly 50 
feet below sea level. This means 
that in past centuries the drop 
was 7-8 feet per century. 

But, since about 1900, the aver- 
age temperature of that area has 
risen by about 2 degrees Fahren- 


 



heit This not only meant higher 
evaporation losses the year round; 
it also meant less water supply. 
The Volga lost more water by 
evaporation before the sea was 
reached, and other rivers carried 
less water to begin with, especially 
the ones from the Caucasus, where 
the snow line moved up so that 
there was less snow and ice to 
melt in spring. Finally, during the 
last few years, the hydro-electric 
activities of the Russians have 
withheld Volga water. 

Naturally the Russians are ask- 
ing themselves what they can do 
about it. They don't like their an- 
nual billion-ruble deficit. One sim- 
ple and obvious suggestion is, of 
course, to dam the outlet into the 
Kara-Bogaz-Gol. It would save 
5,184 million cubic feet of water 
per month. This sounds large, but 
would not make too much differ- 
ence as far as the whole body of 
the Caspian Sea is concerned. In 
fact, if the inlet is ever dammed 
up, it would be not to save water, 
but to facilitate the exploitation of 
the mineral deposits at the bot- 
tom of the bay. 

A NOTHER suggestion, made 
-^*- by the oceanographer B. A. 
Apollov, is not so much concerned 
with the Caspian Sea as a whole 
as with the northern portion, which 
is of economic importance because 
of the fisheries. 

The distance from the mouth of 



the Kuma River to the island of 
Kulaly is 280 miles. If one built 
a dam across the Caspian Sea from 
the west shore to Kulaly Island, 
and from the island to a convenient 
point of the east shore, the valu- 
able northern portion would be 
separated from the southern por- 
tion which is without fisheries of 
any consequence. The waters com- 
ing from the Volga, the Ural, the 
Emba and the Kuma would then 
all remain in the northern portion. 

This would tend to freshen the 
water of this section some more, 
but this would be unimportant in 
either direction since it is, for most 
practical purposes, fresh water 
right now. It would put the fisher- 
men back into their normal occu- 
pation. It would avoid expensive 
dredging for the approaches to the 
northern ports, especially Astrak- 
han, which has to go on all the 
time. And, of course, the dam could 
have several lock gates in con- 
venient places so that shipping 
could go on from the north to the 
south and vice versa. 

Apollov's suggestion is not yet 
a "plan" and certainly not yet a 
"project." It would require a very 
large amount of preliminary sur- 
veys to establish the type of dam, 
the method of construction and 
even the line which it would most 
efficiently follow across the sea. 
That a 280-mile dam through 
shallow water is an engineering 
possibility cannot be doubted.

What it would cost is another tor. The real reason is a minor 

problem, but anything that can climatic change. But again, even 

help avoid an annual billion-ruble that change merely accelerated 

loss is worth looking into from a something that had been going on 

Russian standpoint. at a lesser rate for centuries. 

It seems to be the simplest way And the whole trouble started, of 

to save the fisheries, including the course, way back in that unknown

PICK A CRIME 



By RICHARD R. SMITH 



Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



THE GIRL was tall, wide- 
eyed and brunette. She had 
the right curves in the right 
places and would have been beau- 
tiful if her nose had been smaller, 
if her mouth had been larger and 
if her hair had been wavy instead 
of straight. 

"Hank said you wanted to see 
me," she said when she stopped 
beside Joe's table. 

"Yeah." Joe nodded at the other 
chair. "Have a seat." He reached 
into a pocket, withdrew five ten- 



dollar bills and handed them to 
her. "I want you to do a job for 
me. It'll only take a few minutes." 

The girl counted the money, 
then placed it in her purse. Joe 
noticed a small counterfeit-detec- 
tor inside the purse before she 
closed it "What's the job?" 

"Tell you later." He gulped the 
remainder of his drink, almost 
pouring it down his throat. 

"Hey. You trying to make your- 
self sick?" 

"Not sick. Drunk. Been trying to

get drunk all afternoon." As the 
liquor settled in his stomach, he 
waited for the warm glow. But 
the glow didn't come . . . the bar- 
tender had watered his drink again. 

"Trying to get drunk?" the girl 
inquired. "Are you crazy?" 

"No. If s simple. If I get drunk, 
I can join the AAA and get free 
room and board for a month while 
they give me a treatment." 

It was easy enough to under- 
stand, he reflected, but a lot 
harder to do. The CPA robot bar- 
tenders saw to it that anyone got 
high if they wanted, but com- 
paratively few got drunk. Each 
bartender could not only mix 
drinks but could also judge by a 
man's actions and speech when he 
was on the verge of drunkenness. 
At the proper time — since drun- 
kenness was illegal — a bartender 
always watered the drinks. 

Joe had tried dozens of times 
in dozens of bars to outsmart them, 
but had always failed. And in all 
of New York's millions, there had 
been only a hundred cases of in- 
toxication during the previous year. 

The girl laughed. "If you're that 
hard up, I don't know if I should 
take this fifty or not. Why don't 
you go out and get a job like 
everyone else?" 

As an answer, Joe handed her 
his CPA ID card. She grunted 
when she saw the large letters that 
indicated the owner had Dan- 
gerous Criminal Tendencies. 

70 



WfHEN she handed the card 
" back, Joe fought an impulse 
to tear it to pieces. He'd done that 
once and gone through a mountain 
of red tape to get another — every- 
one was required by law to car- 
ry a CPA ID card and show it 
upon request. 

"I'm sorry," the girl said. "I 
didn't know you were a DCT." 

"And who'll hire a guy with 
criminal tendencies? You know the 
score. When you try to get a job, 
they ask to see your ID before 
they even tell you if there's an 
opening or not. If your CPA ID 
says you're a DCT, you're SOL 
and they tell you there's no open- 
ings. Oh, I've had several jobs . . . 
jobs like all DCTs get. I've been 
a garbage man, street-cleaner, 
ditch-digger—" 

On the other side of the room, 
the jukebox came to life with a 
roar and a group of teen-agers 
scrambled to the dance floor. 

Feeling safe from hidden micro- 
phones because of the uproar, he 
leaned across the table and whis- 
pered in the girl's ear, "That's what 
I want to hire you for. I want you 
to help me commit a crime. If 
I get convicted of a crime, I'll be 
able to get a good job!" 

The girl's lips formed a bright 
red circle. "Say! You really got 
big plans, don't you?" 

He smiled at her admiration. It 
was something big to plan a crime. 
A civilization weary of murder, 


 



robbery, kidnapping, counterfeit- 
ing, blackmail, rape, arson, and 
drunkenness had originated the 
CP A— Crime Prevention Associa- 
tion. There were no longer any 
prisons — CPA officials had de- 
clared loudly and emphatically 
that their job was to prevent 
crime, not punish it. And prevent 
it they did, with thousands of in- 
genious crime-prevention devices 
and methods. They had made 
crime almost impossible, and dur- 
ing the previous year, only a few 
hundred men in the whole coun- 
try had been convicted of criminal 
acts. 

No crime was ever punished. If 
a man was smart enough to kill 
someone, for instance, he wasn't 
sent to prison to be punished; he 
wasn't punished at all. Instead, he 
was sent to a hospital where all 
criminal tendencies were removed 
from his mind by psychologists, 
shock treatments, encephalograph- 
ic devices, a form of prefrontal 
lobotomy and a dozen other meth- 
ods. An expensive operation, but 
since there were few criminals- 
only ten in New York during the 
past year — any city could af- 
ford the CPA hospitals. 

The CPA system was, actually, 
cheaper than previous methods 
because it did away with the 
damage caused by countless 
crimes; did away with prisons and 
their guards, large police forces, 
squad cars and weapons. 



And, ironically, a man who did 
commit a crime was a sort of hero. 
He was a hero to the millions of 
men and women who had sup- 
pressed impulses to kill someone, 
beat their mates, get drunk, or kick 
a dog. Not only a hero, but be- 
cause of the CPA Treatment, he 
was — when he left one of the CPA 
hospitals — a thoroughly honest 
and hard-working individual ... a 
man who could be trusted with 
any responsibility, any amount of 
money. And therefore, an EX (a 
convicted criminal who received 
the treatment was commonly 
called an Ex because he was in the 
strictest sense of the word an Ex- 
criminal) ... an Ex was always 
offered the best jobs. 

"Well," the girl said. Tm hon- 
ored. Really. But I got a date at 
ten. Let's get it over with. You 
said itM only take a few minutes." 

"Okay. Let's go." 

TPHE girl followed him across 
-■• the room, around tables, 
through a door, down a hall, 
through a back door and into the 
alley. 

She followed him up the dark 
alley until he turned suddenly and 
ripped her blouse and skirt. 

He surprised her completely, 
but when she recovered, she 
backed away, her body poised like 
a wrestler's. "What's the big idea?" 

"Scream," Joe said. "Scream as 
loud as you can, and when the 



PICK A CRIME 



71 



cops get here, tell 'em I tried to 
rape you.* 

The plan was perfect, he told 
himself. Attempted rape was one 
of the few things that was a crime 
merely because a man attempted 
it. A crime because it theoretically 
inflicted psychological injury upon 
the intended victim — and be- 
cause millions of women voters 
had voted it a crime. On the other 
hand, attempted murder, robbery, 
kidnapping, etc., were not crimes. 
They weren't crimes because the 
DCT didn't complete the act, and 
if he didn't complete the act, that 
meant simply that the CPA had 
once again functioned properly. 

The girl shook her head vigor- 
ously. "Sorry, buddy. Can't help 
you that way. Why didn't you tell 
me what you wanted?" 

"Whaf s the matter?" Joe com- 
plained. "I'm not asking you to do 
anything wrong." 

"You stupid jerk. What do you 
think this is — the Middle Ages? 
Don't you know almost every 
woman knows how to defend her- 
self? I'm a sergeant in the WSDA!" 

Joe groaned. The WSDA — 
Women's Self-Defense Association 
- a branch of the CPA. The 
WSDA gave free instruction in 
judo and jujitsu, even developed 
new techniques of wrestling and 
instructed only women in those 
new techniques. 

The girl was still shaking her 
head. "Can't do it, buddy. Td lose 



my rank if you were convicted 
of-" 

"Do I have to make you 
scream?" Joe inquired tiredly and 
advanced toward the girl. 

"— and that rank carries a lot 
of weight. Hey! Stop it!" 

Joe discovered to his dismay 
that the girl was telling the truth 
when she said she was a sergeant 
in the WSDA. He felt her hands 
on his body, and in the time it 
takes to blink twice, he was fly- 
ing through the air. 

The alley's concrete floor was 
hard — it had always been hard, 
but he became acutely aware of 
its lack of resiliency when his head 
struck it. There was a wonderful 
moment while the world was filled 
with beautiful stars and streaks of 
lightning through which he heard 
distant police sirens. But the won- 
derful moment didn't last long and 
darkness closed in on him, 

VK7HEN he awoke, a rough 
™ voice was saying, "Okay. 
Snap out of it " 

He opened his eyes and recog- 
nized the police commissioner's of- 
fice. It would be hard not to 
recognize: the room was large, de- 
void of furniture except for a 
desk and chairs, but the walls were 
lined with the controls of televi- 
sion screens, electronic calculators 
and a hundred other machines that 
formed New York's mechanical 
police force.

Commissioner Hendricks was a 
remarkable character. There was 
something wrong with his glands, 
and he was a huge, greasy bulk of 
a man with bushy eyebrows and 
a double chin. His steel-gray eyes 
showed something of his intelli- 
gence and he would have gone far 
in politics if fate hadn't made him 
so ugly, for more than half the 
voters who elected men to high 
political positions were women. 

Anyone who knew Hendricks 
well liked him, for he was a friend- 
ly, likable person. But the mil- 
lions of women voters who saw his 
face on posters and on their TV 
screens saw only the ugly face and 
heard only the harsh voice. The 
President of the United States was 
a capable man, but also a very 
handsome one, and the fact that 
a man who looked something like 
a bulldog had been elected as New 
Yorkfs police commissioner was a 
credit to Hendricks and millions of 
women voters. 

'Where's the girl?" Joe asked. 

"I processed her while you were 
out cold. She left. Joe, you—* 

"Okay," Joe said. "I'll save you 
the trouble. I admit it Attempted 
rape. I confess." 

Hendricks smiled. "Sorry, Joe. 
You missed the boat again." He 
reached out and turned a dial on 
his desk top. "We had a micro- 
phone hidden in that alley. We 
have a lot of microphones hidden 
in a lot of alleys. You'd be sur- 



prised at the number of conspira- 
cies that take place in alleys!" 

Joe listened numbly to his voice 
as it came from one of the hun- 
dreds of machines on the walls, 
"Scream. Scream as loud as you 
can, and when the cops get here, 
tell 'em I tried to rape you" And 
then the girl's voice, "Sorry, buddy. 
Can't help- 99 

He waved his hand. "Okay. Shut 
it off. I confess to conspiracy." 

TTENDRICKS rose from behind 
-■--■- the desk, walked leisurely to 
where Joe was slouched in a chair. 
"Give me your CPA ID." 

Joe handed him the card with 
trembling fingers. He felt as if the 
world had collapsed beneath him. 
Conspiracy to commit a crime 
wasn't a crime. Anyone could con- 
spire. And if the conspirators were 
prevented from committing a 
crime, then that meant the CPA 
had functioned properly once 
again. That meant the CPA 
had once again prevented crime, 
and the CPA didn't punish crimes 
or attempted crimes, and it didn*t 
attempt to prevent crimes by pun- 
ishment. If it did, that would be a 
violation of the New Civil Rights, 

Hendricks crossed the room, de- 
posited the card in a slot and 
punched a button. The machine 
hummed and a new card appeared. 

When Hendricks handed him 
the new card, Joe saw that the 
words DANGEROUS CRIMI- 



PICK A CRIME 



73 




NAL TENDENCIES were now 
in red and larger than before. And, 
in slightly smaller print, the ID 
card stated that the owner was a 
DCT First Class. 

"YouVe graduated," Hendricks 
said coldly. "You guys never learn, 
do you? Now you're a DCT First 
Class instead of a Second Class. 
You know what that means?" 

Hendricks leaned closer until Joe 
could feel his breath on his face. 
"That means your case history will 
be turned over to the newspapers. 
You'll be the hobby of thousands of 
amateur cops. You know how it 
works? It's like this. The Joneses 
are sitting around tomorrow night 
and they're bored. Then Mr. Jones 
says, 'Lef s go watch this Joe Har- 
per.' So they look up your record — 
amateur cops always keep records 
of First Classes in scrapbooks — and 
they see that you stop frequently at 
Waifs Tavern. 

"So they go there and they sit and 
drink and watch you, trying not to 
let you know they're watching you. 
They watch you all night, just hop- 
ing you'll do something exciting, 
like trying to kill someone, so they 
can be the first ones to yell 'Police!' 
They'll watch you because if s excit- 
ing to be an amateur cop, and if 
they ever did prevent you from 
committing a crime, they'd get a 
nice reward and they'd be famous." 

"Lay off," Joe said. "I got a head- 
ache. That girl — " 

Hendricks leaned even closer and 



glared. "You listen, Joe. This is 
interesting. You see, it doesn't stop 
with Mr. and Mrs. Jones. There's 
thousands of people like them. 
Years ago, they got their kicks from 
reading about guys like you, but 
these days things are dull because 
it's rare when anyone commits a 
crime. So every time you walk down 
the street, there'll be at least a dozen 
of 'em following you, and no matter 
where you go, you can bet there'll 
be some of 'em sitting next to you, 
standing next to you. 

"During the day, they'll take your 
picture with their spy cameras that 
look like buttons on their coats. At 
night, they'll peep at you through 
your keyhole. Your neighbors 
across the street will watch you 
through binoculars and — " 

"Lay off!" 

JOE squirmed in the chair. He'd 
been lectured by Hendricks be- 
fore and it was always an unpleas- 
ant experience. The huge man was 
like a talking machine once he got 
started, a machine that couldn't be 
stopped. 

"And the kids are the worst," 
Hendricks continued. "They have 
Junior CPA clubs. They keep rec- 
ords of hoodlums like you in little 
cardboard boxes. They'll stare at 
you on the street and stare at you 
through restaurant windows while 
you're eating meals. They'll follow 
you in public rest rooms and watch 
you out of the corners of their eyes

while they wash their little hands, 
and almost every day when you 
look back, you'll see a dozen freckle- 
faced little boys following you half 
a block behind, giggling and gaping 
at you. They'll follow you until the 
day you die, because you're a freak!" 

Joe couldn't stand the breath in 
his face any longer. He rose and 
paced the floor. 

"And it doesn't end there, Joe. It 
goes on and on. You'll be the object 
of every do-gooder and parlor psy- 
chologist. Strangers will stop you 
on the street and say, Td like to 
help you, friend.' Then they'll ask 
you queer questions like, "Did your 
father reject you when you were a 
child?' 'Do you like girls?' 'How 
does it feel to be a DCT First 
Class?' And then there'll be the 
strangers who hate DCTs. They'll 
stop you on the street and insult 
you, call you names, spit on you 
and-" 

"Okay, goddam it! Stop it!" 

Hendricks stopped, wiped the 
sweat from his face with a handker- 
chief and lit a cigarette. 

"I'm doing you a favor, Joe. I'm 
trying to explain something you're 
too dumb to realize by yourself. 
We've taught everyone to hate 
crime and criminals ... to hate them 
as nothing has ever been hated be- 
fore. Today a criminal is a freak, an 
alien. Your life will be a living hell 
if you don't leave New York. You 
should go to some small town where 
there aren't many people, or be a 



hermit, or go to Iceland or — " 

Joe eyed the huge man suspi- 
ciously. "Favor, did you say? The 
day you do me a favor — " 

Hendricks shrugged his shoulders 
negligently. "Not entirely a favor. I 
want to get rid of you. Usually I 
come up here and sit around and 
read books. But guys like you are a 
nuisance and take up my time." 

"I couldn't leave if I wanted to," 
Joe said. "I'm flat broke. Thanks to 
your CPA system, a DCT can't get 
a decent job." 

XTENDRICKS reached into a 
*■"*• pocket, withdrew several bills 
and extended them. "I'll loan you 
some money. You can sign an IOU 
and pay me back a little at a time." 

Joe waved the money away. "Lis- 
ten, why don't you do me a favor? 
Why don't you frame me? If I'm 
such a nuisance, pin a crime on me 
— any crime." 

"Can't do it. Convicting a man of 
a crime he didn't commit is a viola- 
tion of Civil Rights and a crime in 
itself." 

"Umm." 

"Why don't you take the free 
psycho treatment? A man doesn't 
have to be a DCT. With the free 
treatment, psychologists can re- 
move all your criminal tendencies 
and - " 

"Go to those head-shrinkers?" 

Hendricks shrugged again. "Have 
it your way." 

Joe laughed. "If your damned 



76 




 



CPA is so all-powerful, why can't 
you make me go?" 

"Violation of Civil Rights." 

"Damn it, there must be some 
way you can help me! We both 
want the same thing. We both want 
to see me convicted of a crime." 

"How can I help you without 
committing a crime myself?" Hen- 
dricks walked to his desk, opened a 
drawer and removed a small black 
book. "See this? It contains names 
and addresses of all the people in 
New York who aren't properly pro- 
tected. Every week we find people 
who aren't protected properly — 
blind spots in our protection devices. 
As soon as we find them, we take 
steps to install anti-robbery devices, 
but this is a big city and sometimes 
it takes days to get the work done. 

"In the meantime, any one of 
these people could be robbed. But 
what can I do? I can't hold this 
book in front of your nose and say, 
'Here, Joe, pick a name and go out 
and rob him.' " He laughed ner- 
vously. "If I did that, I'd be com- 
mitting a crime myself!" 

He placed the book on the desk 
top, took a handkerchief from a 
pocket again and wiped sweat from 
his face. "Excuse me a minute. I'm 
dying of thirst. There's a water 
cooler in the next room." 

Joe stared at the door to the ad- 
joining office as it closed behind the 
big man. Hendricks was — unbeliev- 
ably — offering him a victim, offer- 
ing him a crime! 



Almost running to the desk, Joe 
opened the book, selected a name 
and address and memorized it: 
John Gralewski, Apt 204, 2141 
Orange St 

When Hendricks came back, Joe 
said, "Thanks." 

"Huh? Thanks for what? I didn't 
do anything." 

WfHEN Joe reached the street, 
™ he hurried toward the nearest 
subway. As a child, he had been 
frightened of the dark. As a man, 
he wasn't afraid of the dark itself, 
but the darkened city always made 
him feel ill at ease. The uneasiness 
was, more than anything else, 
caused by his own imagination. He 
hated the CPA and at night he 
couldn't shrug the feeling that the 
CPA lurked in every shadow, 
watching him, waiting for him to 
make a mistake. 

Imagination or not, the CPA was 
almost everywhere a person went. 
Twenty-four hours a day, millions 
of microphones hidden in taverns, 
alleys, restaurants, subways and 
every other place imaginable waited 
for someone to say the wrong thing. 
Everything the microphones picked 
up was routed to the CPA Brain, a 
monster electronic calculator. 

If the words "Let's see a movie" 
were received in the Brain, they 
were discarded. But if the words 
"Let's roll this guy" were received, 
the message was traced and a police 
helicopter would be at the scene in

two minutes. And scattered all over 
the city were not only hidden micro- 
phones, but hidden television cam- 
eras that relayed visual messages to 
the Brain, and hidden machines 
that could detect a knife or a gun 
in someone's pocket at forty yards. 

Every place of business from the 
largest bank to the smallest grocery 
store was absolutely impenetrable. 
No one had even tried to rob a 
place of business for years. 

Arson was next to impossible be- 
cause of the heat-detectors— devices 
placed in every building that could 
detect, radarlike, any intensity of 
heat above that caused by a ciga- 
rette lighter. Chemical research had 
made poisoning someone an im- 
possibility. There were no drugs 
containing poison, and while an ant- 
poison might kill ants, no concen- 
trated amount of it would kill a 
human. 

The FBI had always been a pow- 
erful organization, but under the 
supervision of the CPA, it was a 
scientific colossus and to think of 
kidnapping someone or to contem- 
plate the use of narcotics was point- 
less. A counterfeiter's career was 
always short-lived: every place of 
business and millions of individuals 
had small counterfeit-detectors that 
could spot a fake and report it 
directly to the Brain. 

And the percentage of crimes had 
dwindled even more with the ap- 
pearance of the robot police officers. 
Many a criminal in the past had 



gambled that he could outshoot a 
pursuing policeman. But the robots 
were different: they weren't flesh 
and blood. Bullets bounced off them 
and their aim was infallible. 

IT was like a fantastic dream 
come true. Only the dream 
wasn't fantastic any more. With 
the huge atomic power plants 
scattered across the country and 
supplying endless electrical power 
at ridiculously low prices, no en- 
deavor that required power was 
fantastic. The power required to 
operate the CPA devices cost each 
taxpayer an average of four dollars 
a year, and the invention, develop- 
ment and manufacture of the de- 
vices had cost even less. 

And the CPA had attacked crime 
through society itself, striking at the 
individual. In every city there were 
neon signs that blinked sublimi- 
nally with the statement, CRIME 
IS FILTH. Listening to a radio or 
watching television, if a person 
heard station identification, he in- 
variably heard or saw just below 
perception the words CRIME IS 
FILTH. If he went for a walk or a 
ride, he saw the endless subliminal 
posters declaring CRIME IS 
FILTH, and if he read a magazine 
or newspaper he always found, in 
those little dead spaces where an 
editor couldn't fit anything else, the 
below-perception words CRIME 
IS FILTH. 

It was monotonous and, after a 



78 




 



while, a person looked at the words 
and heard them without thinking 
about them. And they were im- 
printed on his subconscious over 
and over, year after year, until he 
knew that crime was the same as 
filth and that criminals were filthy 
things. 

Except men like Joe Harper. No 
system is perfect. Along with thou- 
sands of other DCTs, Joe refused to 
believe it, and when he reached 
apartment 204 at 2141 Orange 
Street, he felt as if he'd inherited a 
gold mine. 

The hall was dimly lit, but when 
he stood before the door numbered 
204, he could see that the wall on 
either side of it was new. That is, 
instead of being covered with dust, 
dirt and stains as the other walls 
were, it was clean. The building was 
an old one, the hall was wide, and 
the owner had obviously con- 
structed a wall across the hall, cre- 
ating another room. If the owner 
had reported the new room as re- 
quired by law, it would have been 
wired with CPA burglarproof de- 
vices, but evidently he didn't want 
to pay for installation. 

When Joe entered the cubbyhole, 
he had to stand to one side in order 
to close the door behind him. The 
place was barely large enough for 
the bed, chair and bureau; it was a 
place where a man could fall down 
at night and sleep, but where no 
normal man could live day after 
day. 



Fearing that someone might de- 
tect him before he actually com- 
mitted the crime, Joe hurried to the 
bureau and searched it. 

TTE broke out in a sweat when 
-■"■- he found nothing but under- 
wear and old magazines. If he stole 
underwear and magazines, it would 
still be a crime, but the newspapers 
would splash satirical headlines. 
Instead of being respected as a suc- 
cessful criminal, he would be ridi- 
culed. 

He stopped sweating when he 
found a watch under a pile of under- 
wear. The crystal was broken, one 
hand was missing and it wouldn't 
run, but — perfection itself — en- 
graved on the back was the inscrip- 
tion, To John with Love. His trial 
would be a clean-cut one: it would 
be easy for the CPA to prove own- 
ership and that a crime had been 
committed. 

Chuckling with joy, he opened 
the window and shouted, "Thief! 
Police! Help!" 

He waited a few seconds and then 
ran. When he reached the street, a 
police helicopter landed next to 
him. Strong metal arms seized him; 
cameras clicked and recorded the 
damning evidence. 

When Joe was securely hand- 
cuffed to a seat inside the helicopter, 
the metal police officers rang door- 
bells. There was a reward for any- 
one who reported a crime, but no 
one admitted shouting the warning.

TTE was having a nightmare when 
-■--■-he heard the voice, "Hey. 
Wake up. Hey!" 

He opened his eyes, saw Hen- 
dricks' ugly face and thought for a 
minute he was still having the night- 
mare. 

"I just saw your doctor," Hen- 
dricks said. "He says your treatment 
is over. You can go home now. I 
thought I'd give you a lift." 

As Joe dressed, he searched his 
mind and tried to find some differ- 
ence. 

During the treatment, he had 
been unconscious or drugged, un- 
able to think. Now he could think 
clearly, but he could find no differ- 
ence in himself. 

He felt more relaxed than he'd 
ever felt before, but that could be 
an after-effect of all the sedatives 
he'd been given. And, he noticed 
when he looked in the mirror, he 
was paler. The treatment had taken 
months and he had, between opera- 
tions, been locked in his room. 

Hendricks was standing by the 
window. Joe stared at the massive 
back. Deliberately goading his 
mind, he discovered the biggest 
change: Before, the mere sight of 
the man had aroused an intense 
hatred. Now, even when he tried, he 
succeeded in arousing only a mild 
hatred. They had toned down his 
capacity to hate, but not done away 
with it altogether. 

"Come here and take a look at 
your public," said Hendricks. 



Joe went to the window. Three 
stories below, a large crowd had 
gathered on the hospital steps: a 
band, photographers, television 
trucks, cameramen and autograph 
hunters. He'd waited a long time for 
this day. But now — another change 
in him — 

He put the emotion into words: 
"I don't feel like a hero. Funny, but 
I don't." 

"Hero!" Hendricks laughed and, 
with his powerful lungs, it sounded 
like a bull snorting. "You think a 
successful criminal is a hero? You 
stupid - " 

He laughed again and waved a 
hand at the crowd below them. 
"You think those people are down 
there because they admire what you 
did? They're down there waiting for 
you because they're curious, because 
they're glad the CPA caught you, 
and because they're glad you're an 
Ex. You're an ex-criminal now, and 
because of your treatment, you'll 
never be able to commit another 
crime as long as you live. And that's 
the kind of guy they admire, so they 
want to see you, shake your hand 
and get your autograph." 

Joe didn't understand Hendricks 
completely, but the part he did 
understand he didn't believe. A 
crowd was waiting for him. He 
could see the people with his own 
eyes. When he left the hospital, 
they'd cheer and shout and ask for 
his autograph. If he wasn't a hero, 
what was he? 



. 




 



T took half an hour to get 
■■■ through the crowd. Cameras 
clicked all around him, a hundred 
kids asked for his autograph, every- 
one talked at once and cheered, 
smiled, laughed, patted him on the 
back and cheered some more. 

Only one thing confused him dur- 
ing all the excitement: a white- 
haired old lady with tears in her 
eyes said, "Thank heaven it was 
only a watch. Thank heaven you 
didn't kill someone! God bless you, 
son." And then the old lady had 
handed him a box of fudge and left 
him in total confusion. 

What she said didn't make sense. 
If he had killed someone rather 
than stealing a watch, he would be 
even more of a hero and the crowd 
would have cheered even louder. 
He knew: he had stood outside the 
CPA hospitals many times and the 
crowds always cheered louder when 
an ex-murderer came out 

In Hendricks' robot-chauffeured 
car, he ate the fudge and consoled 
himself with the thought, People are 
funny. Who can understand 'em? 

Feeling happy for one of the few 
times in his life, he turned toward 
Hendricks and said, "Thanks for 
what you did. It turned out great. 
I'll be able to get a good job now." 

"That's why I met you at the 
hospital," Hendricks said. "I want to 
explain some things. I've known 
you for a long time and I know 
you're spectacularly dumb. You 
can't figure out some things for 



yourself and I don't want you walk- 
ing around the rest of your life 
thinking I did you a favor." 

Joe frowned. Few men had ever 
done him a favor and he had rarely 
thanked anyone for anything. And 
now . . . after thanking the man 
who'd done him the biggest favor 
of all, the man was denying it! 

"You robbed Gralewski's apart- 
ment," Hendricks said. "Gralewski 
is a CPA employee and he doesn't 
live in the apartment you robbed. 
The CPA pays the rent for that one 
and he lives in another. We have a 
lot of places like that. You see, it 
gives us a way to get rid of saps like 
you before they do real damage. 
We use it as a last resort when a 
DCT First Class won't take the free 
psycho treatment or — " 

"Well, it's still a favor." 

Hendricks' face hardened. "Fa- 
vor? You wouldn't know a favor if 
you stumbled over one. I did it be- 
cause it's standard procedure for 
your type of case. Anyone can — 
free of charge — have treatment by 
the best psychologists. Any DCT 
can stop being a DCT by simply 
asking for the treatment and taking 
it. But you wouldn't do that. You 
wanted to commit a crime, get 
caught and be a hero ... an Ex." 

^HE car passed one of the CPA 
playgrounds. Boys and girls of 
all ages were laughing, squealing 
with joy as they played games de- 
signed by CPA psychologists to 



PICK A CRIME 



81 









relieve tension. And — despite the 
treatment, Joe shuddered when he 
saw the psychologists standing to 
one side, quietly watching the chil- 
dren. The whole world was filled 
with CPA employees and volunteer 
workers. Everywhere you went, it 
was there, quietly watching you and 
analyzing you, and if you showed 
criminal tendencies, it watched 
you even more closely and ana- 
lyzed you even more deeply until 
it took you apart and put you back 
together again the way it wanted 
you to be. 

"Being an Ex, you'll get the kind 
of job you always wanted," Hen- 
dricks continued. "You'll get a good- 
paying job, but you'll work for it. 
You'll work eight hours a day, work 
harder than you've ever worked be- 
fore in your life, because every time 
you start to loaf, a voice in your 
head is going to say, Work! Work! 
Exes always get good jobs because 
employers know they're good 
workers. 

"But during these next few days, 
you'll discover what being an Ex is 
like. You see, Joe, the treatment 
can't possibly take all the criminal 
tendencies out of a man. So the 
treatment does the next best thing 
— you'll find a set of laws written in 
your mind. You might want to 
break one now and then, but you 
won't be able. I'll give you an illus- 
tration . . ." 

Joe's face reddened as Hendricks 
proceeded to call him a series of 



names. He wanted to smash the fat, 
grinning face, but the muscles in his 
arm froze before it moved it an inch. 

And worse than that, a brief pain 
ripped through his skull. A pain so 
intense that, had it lasted a second 
longer, he would have screamed in 
agony. And above the pain, a voice 
whispered in his head, Unlawful to 
strike someone except in self- 
defense. 

He opened his mouth to tell Hen- 
dricks exactly what he thought of 
him, the CPA, the whole world. But 
the words stayed in his throat, the 
pain returned, and the mental voice 
whispered, Unlawful to curse. 

He had never heard how the 
treatment prevented an Ex from 
committing a crime. And now that 
he knew, it didn't seem fair. He de- 
cided to tell the whole story to the 
newspapers as soon as he could. 
And as soon as that decision formed 
in his mind, his body froze, the pain 
returned and the voice, Unlawful to 
divulge CPA procedure. 

"See what I mean?" Hendricks 
asked. "A century ago, you would 
have been locked in a prison and 
taxpayers' money would have sup- 
ported you until the day you died. 
With the CPA system, you're re- 
turned to society, a useful citizen, 
unable to commit the smallest 
crime. And you've got a big hand in 
your dirty little mind that's going to 
slap it every time you get the wrong 
kind of thought. It'll keep slapping 
you until you learn. It might take 



82 




 



weeks, months or years, but youll 
learn sooner or later to not even 
think about doing anything wrong." 

TTE lit a cigarette and blew a 
-■"■■ smoke ring at the car's plush 
ceiling. "It*s a great system, isn't it, 
Joe? A true democracy. Even a jerk 
like you is free to do what he wants, 
as long as it's legal.'' 

"I think it's a lousy, filthy system." 
Joe's head was still tingling with 
pain and he felt suffocated. The 
CPA was everywhere, only now it 
was also inside his head, telling him 
he couldn't do this, couldn't do that 
All his life it had been telling him he 
couldn't do things he wanted to do 
and now . . . 

Hendricks laughed. "You'll 
change your opinion. We live in a 



clean, wonderful world, Joe. A 
world of happy, healthy people. 
Except for freaks like yourself, 
criminals are—" 

"Let me out!" Joe grabbed at the 
door and was on the sidewalk, 
slamming the door behind him be- 
fore the car stopped completely. 

He stared at the car as it pulled 
away from the curb and glided into 
the stream of traffic again. He real- 
ized he was a prisoner ... a prisoner 
inside his own body . . . made a 
prisoner by a world that hated him 
back. 

He wanted to spit his contempt, 
but the increasingly familiar pain 
and voice prevented him. 

It was unlawful to spit on a side- 
walk.

Next monlh's issue brings along a name new to this field and returns 
at least one established favorite . . . 

Remember "The Hated" by Paul Flehr, one of the grimmest little 
shockers of the year? New name Flehr follows it up with MARS BY MOON- 
LIGHT, a searingly illuminated novella of a place that is assuredly not nice 
to visit and decidedly worse to live in. Certainly the inhabitants are criminals 
— they are in a Martian penal colony. But what were their crimes — and 
how much time do they have to serve? Of all forms of punishment, the direst 
is to keep such knowledge from inmates, forcing them into tormented self- 
examination and frantic guesswork. But something even more sinister is 
added . . . What happened to the years between their unremembered crimes 
and the moment they found themselves in this camp of the damned? 

In a powerful novelet, established name Robert Sheckley tells of THE 
MINIMUM MAN, the least likely candidate for a cosmic dilemma. Perceveral 
has a nerve asking for nothing more than his own little cubicle and a bit 
to eat . . . he'll take the whole world or else! 

Along with probably another novelet and definitely several short stories 
and our regular features, Willy Ley presents, FOR YOUR INFORMATION, 
perhaps the most unexpected bulletin you might think to discover in this 
level-headed journal. Yes, there's News of Atlantis . . . and, being sober and

THE THIRD LEVEL by Jack 
Finney. Rinehart & Co., Inc., N. Y., 
$3.00 

THIS desirable item, Finney's 
first collection of short stories, 
can stand up proudly to the best 
of the recent crop. Although time- 
travel is the theme of most of 
these yarns from the pages of Col- 
liers, Cosmopolitan and Good 
Housekeeping, his treatment gam- 
uts from the sinister to the hilari- 
ous. 

The other works include off- 
beat love stories, ghost tales and 
unclassifiable zanies. 



The wonderfully titled "Quit 
Zoomin' Those Hands Through the 
Air" is the mad story of the 
world's first pilot and how he al- 
most won the Civil War — for the 
enemy. 

A lovely shorty, "Cousin Len's 
Wonderful Adjective Cellar," is 
a pure delight and a lesson to over- 
flowery authors. 

Don't miss this book. Finney is 
one slick writer who is more than 
a slick trickster.

Duncan. Ballantine Books, N. Y., 
$2.00

rkUNCAN has taken a theme 
*-* that was hot news in SF a 
quarter century ago, that of paral- 
lel universes, and by the mere ad- 
dition of refreshing originality of 
concept has woven an absorbing 
yarn. 

His locus is Santa Felicia Is- 
land in the Caribbean, taken over 
by the Navy for a top-secret proj- 
ect, Lunar One, based on the 
"Homing Pigeon," a guided mis- 
sile. On an earlier test, one passed 
close to the Moon, indicated min- 
eral deposits, and led to the thought 
of homing on such deposits with 
supply drones, followed eventual- 
ly by men. 

During the course of a lecture 
on minimals given to the younger 
officers by the lanky, maladjusted 
civilian scientist, Staghorn, demon- 
strative soap films created by the 
wire-test forms develop an im- 
possibility. Supposedly two-dimen- 
sional Moebius surfaces, they 
should be dispelled by only two 
pin pricks. However, one effort re- 
quires three, causing Staghorn to 
consult with the base psychiatrist 
concerning his sanity. Later, large- 
scale experiments by Staghorn in 
his laboratory result in a dimen- 
sional breakthrough that intro- 
duces a beguiling couple into the 
story and a universal time-lapse 
that sets the world on the verge 
of war. 

Duncan's portrayal of the frus- 
trating ability of Security to fit 



square pegs into round holes rings 
too unhappily true.

of SF. And see if you don't cock

Signo Vinces" and "Adventure of 
the Misplaced Hound" are all 
reasonably amusing. Under one 
cover and in company with minor 
works, though, the cumulative ef- 
fect is less rewarding. 

The Hokans of planet Toka are 
lovable, teddy-bearish creatures 
with overdeveloped imaginations 
and underdeveloped discrimina- 
tion. They are being groomed for 
planetary autonomy but, still Neo- 
lithic culturally, they love to ape 
fictional environments and char- 
acters. 

Plenipotentiary Alex Jones has 
his hands full each time a batch of 
novels is landed. In rapid suc- 
cession, the American West, Vic- 
torian England, the Spanish Main, 
to name a few, are the locales of 
anachronistic action. 

Hoka, like pickles, is a tasty ap- 
petizer in moderation, but leaves 
a characteristic taste if overin- 
dulged.

W. H. Lankersham, Esq., comes 
to town in a remarkable car that 
opens into a five-room apartment 



and announces his contemplated 
construction of a Mysterious Ma- 
chine. Jerry is of considerable 
help, particularly in supplying the 
speed of sound. 

Dines' imagination runs amus- 
ingly riot and his own illustrations 
help sustain the fun. 

RUSTY'S SPACE SHIP by 

Evelyn Sibley Lampman. Double- 
day and Co., N. Y., $2.95 

Tl/TRS. Lampman's charming ju- 
■*-" venile is an account of the ef- 
forts of a fantastically inept extra- 
terrestrial messenger to return an 
errant flying saucer to his ruler. 
Rusty Adams came across it, a cir- 
cular plate of metal, in the dump, 
and found that it would just cover 
the nose of his egg-crate, orange- 
box spaceship. 

Though successfully resisting the 
efforts of the three-foot-high, tooth- 
less reptilian messenger, Tiphia, to 
remove the saucer, Rusty and his 
friends nonetheless fall victim to 
candy-from-a-stranger. Before they 
can suspect, Tiphia has activated 
the saucer and they are Moonward 
bound. The candies have the ex- 
traordinary power to immunize 
them to space environment Un- 
fortunately, Tiphia's poor memory 
can't recall his home satellite's lo- 
cation, necessitating a Systemwide 
search. 

Mrs. Lampman writes like 
Lewis Carroll brought up to date,

and Bernard Krigstein is a wistful- 
ly humorous Tenniel. An irresist- 
ible combination. 

MYSTERIES OF SCIENCE by 
John Rowland. Philosophical Li- 
brary, N. y., $6.00 

T> OWLAND'S subtitle reads "A 
-"■*- Study of the Limitations of 
the Scientific Method." You can 
see without half looking that he is 
a skeptic. He takes to task those 
in any of the sciences who run to 
dogma in their explanations of 
phenomena, particularly the theo- 
retical physicists and the super- 
Darwinian biologists. His tenet is 
that we do not destroy mysteries 
by denying them existence. 

The book has five subdivisions 
covering unsolved mysteries of 
Physics; Biology; Psychology; So- 
ciology; and The Unclassifiable, 
and is certain to massage the gray 
matter into cerebration. 

HIDDEN WORLD by Stanton 
A. Coblentz. Avalon Books, N. Y. 
TWICE IN TIME by Manly 
Wade Wellman. Avalon Books, 
N. Y., $2.75 each 

AVALON is a new name in the 
SF publishing field, but the 
above titles are familiar to the 
old-time aficionado. 

Hidden World, a lead-fisted 
satire, first saw light in 1935. It 



concerns two geologists, trapped in 
a mine cave-in, burrowing into a 
hidden world of two rival troglo- 
ditic nations, Wu and Zu, scientific 
marvels but with social systems 
strictly from Coblentz. Its take- 
offs on sitdown strikes, Roosevelt's 
fishing trips and technocracy date 
it almost to the hour. 

On the other hand, Wellman's 
yarn, though published only five 
years later, stands the test of time 
remarkably well. It is the equal of 
any science-adventure yarn of to- 
day, though his time reflector is a 
bit thick. But, once back in Renais- 
sance Italy, his yarn spins along in 
sprightly style, even though the 
sock ending has been telegraphed 
since page twenty. 

THE MAN WHO REACHED 
THE MOON by Roscoe Fleming. 
Golden Bell Press, Denver, $3.00 

^JF has inspired many poetic ef- 
^ forts, but most writers have 
incorporated their rhymes into the 
story's body. Few have, like Flem- 
ing, issued a volume of poetry 
alone. The title poem is one of the 
shortest of a number of arresting 
works on SF themes. There are 
mundane poems also, but Fleming 
makes an imposing bid for the 
vacant title of Poet Laureate of 
SF in this oftentimes inspiring 
volume.

The 
Iron 

Chancellor 

By ROBERT SILVERBERG 



THE Carmichaels were a 
pretty plump family, to be- 
gin with. Not one of the 
four of them couldn't stand to shed 
quite a few pounds. And there hap- 
pened to be a super-special on ro- 
boservitors at one of the Miracle 
Mile roboshops — 40% off on the 
2061 model, with adjustable calor- 
ic-intake monitors. 

Sam Carmichael liked the idea 
of having his food prepared and 
served by a robot who would keep 
one beady solenoid eye on the col- 
lective family waistline. He 
squinted speculatively at the glos- 
sy display model, absent-mindedly

never seen anything quite like this, 
you know." 

"Neither had we," Carmichael 
said hollowly. 

"Really, though — this is an ut- 
terly new breakthrough in robotic 
science! If we can reproduce this 
effect, it means we can build self- 
willed robots — and think of what 
that means to science!" 

"We know already," Ethel said. 

"I'd love to watch what happens 
when the power source is operat- 
ing," Robinson went on. "For in- 
stance, is that feedback loop really 
negative or—" 

"No!" five voices shrieked at 
once — with Clyde, as usual, com- 
ing in last. 

IT was too late. The entire event 
had taken no more than a 
tenth of a second. Robinson had 
squeezed his neutralizer trigger 
again, activating Bismarck— and in 
one quick swoop the roboservitor 
seized neutralizer and toolbox from 
the stunned repairman, activated 
the privacy field once again, and 
exultantly crushed the fragile neu- 
tralizer between two mighty fin- 
gers. 



Robinson stammered, "But — 
but -" 

"This attempt at interfering with 
the well-being of the Carmichael 
family was ill-advised," Bismarck 
said severely. He peered into the 
toolbox, found a second neutral- 
izer and neatly reduced it to junk. 
He clanged shut his chest-plates. 

Robinson turned and streaked 
for the door, forgetting the reac- 
tivated privacy field. He bounced 
back hard, spinning wildly around. 
Carmichael rose from his seat just 
in time to catch him. 

There was a panicky, trapped 
look on the repairman's face. Car- 
michael was no longer able to 
share the emotion; inwardly he was 
numb, totally resigned, not minded 
for further struggle. 

"He-he moved so fast!" Robin- 
,son burst out. 

"He did indeed," Carmichael 
said tranquilly. He patted his hol- 
low stomach and sighed gently. 
"Luckily, we have an unoccupied 
guest bedroom for you, Mr. Robin- 
son. Welcome to our happy little 
home. I hope you like toast and 
black coffee for breakfast."

been intended for some other 
planet." 

John Davenporfs "Slurvian 
Self-Taught" indicates that there 
is an unknown nationality with- 
out a country, ^identifiable of 
course by language, and gives these 
examples : 
bean, n. A living creature, as in 

human bean, 
cactus, n. pi. The people in a play 

or story. 
lore, n. The more desirable of the 

two berths in a Pullman. 
myrrh, n. A looking glass. 
plight, adj. Courteous. 

Davenport notes that these and 
other instances make good Eng- 
lish words, and concludes there 
are "pure" Slurvians, as opposed to 
those who, in florist shops, buy 
flars, or, traveling abroad, visit 
farn (or forn) countries. Maybe, 
but this deduction should be 
checked against those in the above- 
mentioned "Look Now." 

"I Say It's False!" by Parke 
Cummings tells how to beat all 
true and false quizzes — simply 
say "False!" to every question: 

Q. Dogs cannot climb trees, 
true or false? 

A. False! All dogs are perfect- 
ly capable of climbing trees. The 
reason they do not do so is be- 
cause of an element in the bark of 
trees (sennic acid) which is in- 
jurious to their feet. If it were not 
for that, as tests with trees from 



which that acid has been removed 
prove, dogs would climb trees just 
as eagerly as cats. 

Q. It is colder in winter than 
in summer. True or false? 

A. Not on your tintype! The 
common custom of wearing heavy 
clothing in wintertime has caused 
this popular misconception. Heavy 
clothing impedes the circulation 
and hence leads to the erroneous 
belief that one is "cold" . . . 

Q. Vienna is the capital of 
Austria. True or false? 

A. Oh, lefs not go into that 
again. 

"H. J. Talking" by R. G. G. 
Price is the autobiography of a 
scientist with: 

A wife who discourages him in 
his work (psychological physics) 
and insists the Seven Wonders of 
the World are chosen annually by 
the Swedes. 

A tenant, also a scientist (solar 
biology). 

An indeterminate number of 
children, one of whom is consid- 
ered odd because he was raised 
with three owls in an experiment 
A Financial Flair worth study 
— it includes a plan that would 
allow him to go tax-free if he 
brings in ten new taxpayers. 

No money in my pocket if you 
get The Family Book of Humor; 
just that if you do, don't think of 
it as losing $3.95 but rather as 
gaining 700 fun-filled pages.

JUST put yourself in Daniel Davis' 
place. It's the year 1 ( ,)7(). You're a 
young engineer, about to sell a million- 
dollar invention. You're sitting pretty- 
until your passionate friend, Belle 1 >ar- 
kin, upsets your apple cart. First she 
steals your invention. Then she slips you 
a hypo; puts you in a new kind of deep 
freeze called "The Long Sleep/' 

You wake up 30 YEARS LATER, in 
the year 2000-and you're still only 29 
years old! But time has passed 
while you were in "cold storage," 
and Belle, your csc-sweeiheart, is 
now 30 years older than you are ! 
Well, you've lost interest in her 
anyway, after the way she two- 
timed and future-timed you. 

The Fascinating World of 2000 A.D. 

But there are other attractions 
in that world of 2000 : its women 
in "sticktite" clothes they just 
throw away after wearing ... its 
honeymoon trips to the moon . . . 
its remarkable new conveniences 
...its brand new words of love 
and ways to live. No more menial 
labor. Robots take care of all that. 
Soon you're enjoying life as never 
before! You're glad to be out of 
that miserably backward world 
of the 20th century. 

But unfortunately you must get 
back to the year 1970, to take 
care of one last urgent mission. 
You only hope that you can come 
back to the 21st century by tak- 
ing "The Long Sleep" again. The 
big question is: Can it be done?
