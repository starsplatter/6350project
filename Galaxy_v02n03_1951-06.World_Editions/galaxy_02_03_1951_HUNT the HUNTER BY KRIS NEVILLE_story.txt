HUNT the HUNTER BY KRIS NEVILLE 


WE'RE somewhat to the 
south, I think," Ri 
said, bending over 
the crude field map. "That ridge," 
he pointed, "on our left, is right 
here." He drew a finger down the 
map. "It was over here," he moved 
the finger, "over the ridge, north 
of here, that we sighted them." 
Extrone asked, "Is there a pass?" 
Ri looked up, studying the terrain. He moved his shoulders, 
don't know, but maybe they 
this far. Maybe they're on this s 
of the ridge, too." 

Delicately, Estrone raised a 
hand to his beard. "I'd hate to lose 
a day crossing the ridge," he said. 

"Yes, sir," Ri said. Suddenly he 
threw back his head. "Listen 
"Eh?" Extrone said. 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



"Hear it? That cough? I think 
that's one, from over there. Right 
up ahead of us." 

Extrone raised his eyebrows. 

This time, the coughing roar 
was more distant but distinct. 

"It is !" Ri said. "It's a farn 
beast, all right!" 

Extrone smiled, almost pointed 
teeth showing through the beard. 
"I'm glad we won't have to cross 
the ridge." 

Ri wiped his forehead on the 
back of his sleeve. "Yes, sir." 

"We'll pitch camp right here, 
then," Extrone said. "We'll go 
after it tomorrow." He looked at 
the sky. "Have the bearers hurry." 

"Yes, sir." 

Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. "You, there !" he 
called. "Pitch camp, here!" 

He crossed to Mia, who, along 
with him, had been pressed into 
Extrone's party as guides. Once 
more, Ri addressed the bearers, "Be 
quick, now!" And to Mia, "God 
almighty, he was getting mad." He 
ran a hand under his collar. "It's 
a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'd .hate to think 
of making him climb that ridge." 

Mia glanced nervously over his 
shoulder. "It's that damned pilot's 
fault for setting us down on this 
side. I told him it was the other side. 
I told him so." 

Ri shrugged hopelessly. 

Mia said, "I don't think he even 
saw a blast area over here. I think 
he wanted to get us in trouble." 



"There shouldn't be one. There 
shouldn't be a blast area on this 
side of the ridge, too." 

"That's what I mean. The pilot 
don't like businessmen. He had it 
in for us.'* 

Ri cleared his throat nervously. 
"Maybe you're right." 

"It's the Hunting Club he don't 
like." 

"I wish to God I'd never heard 
of a farn beast," Ri said. "At least, 
then, I wouldn't be one of his 
guides. Why didn't he hire somebody else?" 

MIA looked at his companion. 
He spat. "What hurts most, 
he pays us for it. I could buy half 
this planet, and he makes me his 
guide — at less than I pay my secretary." 

"Well, anyway, we won't have 
to cross that ridge." 

"Hey, you!" Extrone called. 

The two of them turned immediately. 

"You two scout ahead," Extrone 
said. "See if you can pick up some 
tracks." 

"Yes, sir," Ri said, and instantly 
the two of them readjusted their 
shoulder straps and started off. 

Shortly they were inside of the 
scrub forest, safe from sight. "Let's 
wait here," Mia said. 

"No, we better go on. He may 
have sent a spy in." 

They pushed on, being careful 
to blaze the trees, because they 
were not professional guides.

"We don't want to get too near," 
Ri said after toiling through the 
forest for many minutes. "Without 
guns, we don't want to get near 
enough for Ihe fam beast to charge 
us." 

They stopped. The forest was 
dense, the vines clinging. 

"He'll want the bearers to hack 
a path for him," Mia said. "But 
we go it alone. Damn him." 

Ri twisted his mouth into a sour 
frown. He wiped at his forehead. 
"Hot. By God, it's hot. I didn't 
think it was this hot, the first time 
we were here." 

Mia said, "The first time, we 
weren't guides. Wc didn't notice it 
so much then." 

They fought a few yards more 
into the forest. 

Then it ended. Or, rather, there 
was a wide gap. Before them lay a 
blast area, unmistakable. The grass 
was beginning to grow again, but 
the tree stumps were roasted from 
the rocket breath. 

"This isn't ours!" Ri said. "This 
looks like it was made nearly a 
year ago!" 

Mia's eyes narrowed. "The military from Xnile?" 

"No," Ri said. "They don't have 
any rockets this small. And I don't 
think there's another cargo rocket 
on this planet outside of the one 
we leased from the Club. Except 
the one be brought." 

"The ones who discovered the 
farn beasts in the first place?" Mia 
asked. "You think it's their blast?" 



"So?" Ri said. "But who are 
they ?" 

TT WAS Mia's turn to shrug. 
.1 "Whoever they were, they 
couldn't have been hunters. They'd 
have kept the secret better." 

"We didn't do so damned well." 

"We didn't have a chance," Mia 
objected. "Everybody and his 
brother had heard the run i OX that 
farn beasts were somewhere around 
here. It wasn't our fault Extrone 
found out." 

"1 wish wc hadn't shot our 
guide, then. I wish he was here 
instead of us." 

Mia shook perspiration out of 
his eyes, "Wc should have shot our 
pilot, too. That was our mistake. 
The pilot must have been the one 
who told Extrone we'd hunted this 
area." 

"I didn't think a Club pilot 
would do that." 

"After Extrone said he'd hunt 
farn beasts, even if it meant going 
to the alien system? Listen, you 
don't know . . . Wait a minute." 

ffhere was perspiration on Ri's 
upper lip. 

r 7 didn't tell Extrone, if that's 
what you're thinking," Mia said. 

Ri's mouth twisted. "I didn't 
say you did." 

"Listen," Mia said in a hoarse 
whisper. "I just thought. Listen. To 
hell with how he found out. Here's 
the point. Maybe he'll shoot us, 
too, when the hunt's over." 

Ri licked his lips. "No. He 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



wouldn't do that. We're not — not 
just anybody. He couldn't kill us 
like that. Not even him. And besides, why would he want to do 
that? It wouldn't do any good to 
shoot us. Too many people already 
know about the tarn beasts. You 
said that yourself." 

Mia said, "I hope you're right." 
They stood side by side, studying 
the blast area in silence. Finally, 
Mia said, "We better be getting 
back." 

"What'll we tell him?" 

"That we saw tracks. What else 
can we tell him?" 

They turned back along their 
trail, stumbling over vines. 

"It gets hotter at sunset," Ri said 
nervously. 

"The breeze dies down." 

"It's screwy. I didn't think farn 
beasts had this wide a range. There 
must be a lot of them, to be on 
both sides of the ridge like this." 

"There may be a pass," Mia said, 
pushing a vine away. 

Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. 
"I guess that's it. If there were a 
lot of them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, 
it's damned funny, when you think 
about it." 

Mia looked up at the darkening 
sky. "We better hurry," he said. 

WHEN it came over the hastily 
established camp, the rocket 
was low, obviously looking for a 
landing site. It was a military craft, 
from the outpost on the near moon, 



and forward, near the nose, there 
was the blazoned emblem of the 
Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over Extrone's tent, turned 
slowly, spouting fuel expensively, 
and settled into the scrub forest, 
turning the vegetation beneath it 
sere by its blasts. 

Extrone sat on an upholstered 
stool before his tent and spat disgustedly and combed his beard 
with his blunt fingers. 

Shortly, from the direction of 
the rocket, a group of four highranking officers came out of the 
i or est, heading toward him. They 
were spruce, the officers, with military discipline holding their waists 
in and knees almost stiff. 

"What in hell do you want ?" 
Extrone asked. 

They stopped a respectful distance away. "Sir . . ." one began. 

"Haven't I told you gentlemen 
that rockets frighten the game ?" 
Extrone demanded, ominously not 
raising his voice. 

"Sir," the lead officer said, "it's 
another alien ship. It was sighted 
a few hours ago, off this very 
planet, sir." 

Extrone's face looked much too 
innocent. "How did it get there, 
gentlemen ? Why wasn't it destroyed ?" 

"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir." 

"So?" Extrone mocked. 

"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we 
could locate and destroy it."

Extrone stared at them for a. 
space. Then, indifferently, he 
turned away, in the direction of a 
resting bearer. "You!" he said. 
'"Hey! Bring me a drink !" He faced 
the officers again. He smiled maliciously. "I'm staying here." 

The lead officer licked his firm 
lower lip. "But, sir . . ." 

Extrone toyed with his beard. 
"About a year ago, gentlemen, 
there was an alien ship around here 
then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it, didn't you?" 

"Yes, sir. When we located it, 
sir." 

"You'll destroy this one, too," 
Extrone said. 

"We have a tight patrol, sir. It 
can't slip through. But it might try 
a long range bombardment, sir." 

EXTRONE said, "To begin with, 
they probably don't even know 
I'm here. And they probably couldn't hk this area if they did know. 
And you can't afford to let them 
get a shot at me, anyway." 

"That's why we'd like you to 
return to an inner planet, sir." 

Extrone plucked at his right ear 
lobe, half closing his eyes. "You'll 
lose a fleet before you'll dare let 
anything happen to me, gentlemen. 
I'm quite safe here, I think." 

The bearer brought Extrone his 
drink. 

"Get off," Extrone said quietly 
to the four officers. 

Again they turned reluctantly. 
This time, he did not call them 



back. Instead, with amusement, he 
watched until they disappeared into 
the tangle of forest. 

Dusk was falling. . The -takeoff 
blast of the rocket illuminated the 
area, casting weird shadows on the 
gently swaying grasses; there was 
a hot breath of dry air and the 
rocket dwindled toward the stars. 

Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed th e empty glas s 
away, listened for it to shatter. He 
reached out, parted the heavy flap 
to his tent. 

"Sir?" Ri said, hurrying toward 
him in the gathering darkness. 

"Eh?" Extrone said, turning, 
startled. "Oh, you. Well?" 

"We . . . located signs of the 
farn beast, sir. To the east." 

Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, "You killed one, I 
believe, on your trip?" 

Ri shifted. "Yes, sir." 

Extrone held back the flap of the 
tent. "Won't you come in?" he 
asked without any politeness whatever. 

Ri obeyed the order. 

The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky 
feathers, costly of transport space, 
the sleep curtains of silken gauze. 
The floor, heavy, portable tile 
blocks, not the hollow kind, were 
neatly and smoothly inset into the 
ground. Hanging from the center, 
to the left of the slender, handcarved center pole, was a chain of 
crystals. They tinkled lightly when 
Extrone dropped the flap. The light 



HUNT THE HUNTER

was electric from a portable 
dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He 
crossed to the bed, sat down. 

"You were, I believe, the first 
ever to kill a farn beast?" he said. 

"I . . . No, sir. There must have 
been previous hunters, sir." 

EXTRONE narrowed his eyes. 
"I see by your eyes that you 
arc envious — thai is 'the word, isn't 
it? — of my tent." 

Ri looked away from his face. 
"Perhaps I'm envious of your 
reputation as a hunter. You see, I 
have never killed a farn beast. In 
fact, I haven't seen a farn beast." 

Ri glanced nervously around the 
tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extronc's glittering ones. "Few people have seen them, sir." 

"Oh?" Extrone questioned mildly. "I wouldn't say that. I understand that; the aliens hunt them ' 
quite extensively ... on some of 
their planets-" 

"I meant in our system, sir." 
"Of course you did," Extrone 
said, lazily tracing the crease of his 
sleeve with his forefinger. "I imagine these are the only farn beasts in 
our system." 

Ri waited uneasily, not aitswer
"Yes," Extrone said, ".I imagine 
they arc. It would have been a 
shame if you had killed the last 
one. Don't you think so?" 

Ri's hands worried the sides of 
Iiis outer garment. "Yes, sir. It 
would have been.'* 



Extrone pursed his lips. "It 
wouldn't have been very considerate of you tci — But, still, you 
gained valuable experience. I'm 
glad you agreed to come along as* 
my guide." 

"It was an honor, sir." 

Extrone's lip twisted in wry 
amusement. "If I had waited until 
it was safe for me to hunt on an 
alien planet, 1 would not have been 
able to find- such an illustrious 
guide." 

". . . I'm flattered, sir." 

"Of course," Extrone said. "But 
you should have spoken to me 
about it, when you discovered the 
farn beast in our own system." 

"I realize that, sir. That is, I 
had intended at the first opportunity, sir . . ." 

"Of course," Extrone said dryly. 
"Like all of my subjects," he waved 
his hand in a broad gesture, "the 
highest as well as the lowest slave, 
know' me and love me. I know 
your intentions were the best." 

Ri squirmed, his face pale. "We 
do indeed love you, sir." 

Extrone bent forward. "Know 
me and love me." 

"Yes, sir. Know you and love 
you, sir,"-Ri said. 

"Get out!" Extrone said. 

"TT'S frightening," Ri said, "to 
X be that close to him." 
Mia nodded. 

The two of them, beneath the 
leaf -swollen branches of the gnarled 
tree, were seated on their sleeping

bags. The moon was clear and cold 
and bright in a cloudless sky; a 
small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a central mountain ridge 
that bisected it into almost twin 
hemispheres. 

"To think of him. As flesh and 
blood. Not like the— well; that — 
what we've read about." 

Mia. glanced suspiciously around 
him at the shadows. "You begin 
to understand a lot of things, after 
seeing him." 

Ri picked nervously at the cover 
of his sleeping bag. 

"It makes you think," Mia 
added. He twitched. "I'm afraid. 
I'm afraid he'll . . . Listen, we'll 
talk. When 'we get back to civilization. You, me, the bearers. About 
him. He can't let that happen. He'll 
kill us first." 

Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. "No. We have friends. We 
have influence. He couldn't just like 
that — " 

"He could say it was an accident." 

"No," Ri said stubbornly. 

"He can say anything," Mia 
insisted. "He can make people believe anything, Whatever he says. 
There's no "way to check on it." 

"It's getting cold," Ri said. 

"Listen," Mia pleaded. 

"No," Ri said. "Even if we tried 
to tell them, they wouldn't listen. 
Everybody would know we were 
lying. Everything they've come to 
believe would tell them we were 
lying. Everything they've read, 



every picture they've seen. They 
wouldn't believe us. He knows 
that." 

"Listen," Mia repeated intently. 
"This is important.. Right now he 
couldn't afford to let us talk. Not 
right now. Because the Army is not 
agairftt him. Some officers were 
here, just before we came back. A 
bearer overheard them talking. They 
don't want to overthrow him!" 

Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering. 

"That's another lie," Mia continued, "That he protects the people from the Army. That's a lie. I 
don't believe they were ever plotting against him. Not even at first. 
I think they helped him, don't you 
see?" 

Ri whined nervously. 

"It's like this," Mia said. "I see 
it like this. Hie Army put him in 
power when the people were in 
rebellion against military rule." 

RI swallowed. "We couldn't 
make the people believe that." 
"No?" Mia challenged. "Couldn't we? Not today, but what about 
tomorrow ? You'll see. Because I 
think the Army is getting ready to 
invade the alien system!" 

"The people won't support 
them," Ri answered woodenly. 

"Think. If he tells them to, they 
will. They trust him." 

Ri looked around at the shadows. 
"That explains a lot of things," 
Mia said. "I think the Army's been 
preparing for this for a long time. 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



11 



From the first, maybe. That's why 
Extrone cut off our trade with the 
aliens. Partly to keep them from 
learning that he was getting ready 
to invade them, but more to keep 
them from exposing him to the 
people. The aliens wouldn't be 
fooled like we were, so easy»' 

"No!" Ri snapped. "It was to 
keep the natural economic balance." 

"You know that's not right," 

Ri lay down on his bed roll. 
"Don't talk about it. It's not good 
to talk like this. I don't even want 
to listen." 

"When the invasion starts, he'll 
hive to command all their loyalties. To keep them from revolt 
again. They'd be ready to believe 
us, then. He'll have a hard enough 
time without people running around 
trying to tell the truth." 

"You're wrong. He's not like 
that. I know you're wrong." 

Mia smiled twistedly. "How 
many -has he already killed? How 
can we even guess?" 

Ri swallowed sickly. 

"Remember our guide? To keep 
our hunting territory a secret?" 

Ri shuddered. "That's different. 
Don't you see? This is not at all 
like that." 

WTH morning came birds' 
songs, came dew, came 
breakfast smells. The air was sweet 
with cooking' and it was nostalgic, 
childhoodlike, uncontaminated. 

And Extrone stepped out of the 
tent, fully dressed, surly, letting 



the flap slap loudly behind him. He 
stretched hungrily and stared 
around the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with' sleep. 

"Breakfast!" he shouted, and 
two bearers came running with a 
folding table and chair. Behind 
them, a third bearer, carrying a tray 
of various foods; and yet behind 
him, a fourth, with a steaming 
pitcher and a drinking mug. 

Extrone ate hugely, with none of 
the delicacy sometimes affected in 
his conversational gestures. When 
he had finished, he washed his 
mouth with water and spat on the 
ground. 

"Lin!" he said. 

His personal bearer came loping 
toward him. 

"Have you read that manual I 
gave you ?" 

Lin nodded. "Yes." 

Txtrone pushed the table away. 
He smacked his lips wetly. "Very 
ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed 
that I have two businessmen for 
guides? It occurred to me When' I 
got up. They would have spat on 
me, twenty years ago, damn them." 

Lin waited. 

"Now I can spit on them, which 
pleases me." 

"The farn beasts are dangerous, 
sir," Lin said. 

"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did 
the manual say about them?" 

"I believe they're carnivorous, 
sir." 

"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only 



12 




 



information on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual- — 
and, of course, two businessmen." 

"They have very long, sharp 
fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of tearing a man — " 

"An alien?" Extronc corrected. 

"There's not enough difference 
between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an alien to pieces, sir." 

Extrone laughed harshly. "It's 
'sir' -whenever you contradict me?" 

Lin's face remained impassive. 
"I guess it seems that way. Sir." 

"Damned few people would dare 
go as far as you do," Extronc said. 
"But you're afraid of me, too, in 
your own way, aren't you?" 

Lin shrugged. "Maybe." 

"I can see you are. Even my 
wives are. I wonder if anyone can 
know how wonderful it feels to 
have people all afraid of you." 

"The farn beasts, according to 
the manual . . , 

"You are very insistent on one 
subject." 

". . . It's the only thing I know 
anything about. The farn beast, as 
I was saying, sir, is the particular 
enemy of men. Or if you like, of 
aliens. Sir." 

"All right," Extronc said, 
annoyed. "I'll be careful." 

In the distance, a farn beast 
coughed. 

Instantly alert, Extronc said, "Get 
the bearers ! Have some of them 
cut a path through that damn 
thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get the hell over here!" 



Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly 
afire with the excitement of the 
hunt. 

FOUR hours later, they were 
well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked leisurely, well back 
of the cutters, who hacked away, 
methodically, at the vines and 
branches which might impede his 
forward progress. Their sharp, 
awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy 
breathing. 

Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and 
drank deeply of the icy water to 
allay the heat of the forest, a heat 
made oppressive by the press of 
foliage against the outside air. 

Ranging out, on both sides of 
the central body, the two businessmen fought independently against 
the wild growth, each scouting the 
flanks for farn beasts, and ahead, 
beyond the cutters, Lin flittered 
among the tree trunks, sometimes 
far, sometimes near. 

Extrone carried the only weapon, 
slung easily over his shoulder, a 
powerful blast rifle, capable of 
piercing medium armor in sustained 
fire. To his rear, the water carrier 
was trailed by a man bearing a 
folding stool, and behind him, a 
man carrying the heavy, high-powered two-way communication set. 

Once Extronc- unslung his blast 
rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny, 
arboreal mammal, which, upon the 
impact, shattered asunder, to Ex

trone's- satisfied chuckle, in a burst 
of blood and fur. 

When the sun stood high and 
heat exhaustion made the nearnaked bearers slump, Estrone permitted a rest. While waiting for 
the march to resume, he sat on the 
stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted, reflectively, 
the blast rifle, lying across his legs. 

"For you, sir," 'the communications man said, interrupting his 
reverie. 

"Damn," Extrone muttered. His 
face twisted in anger. "It better be 
important." He took the head-set 
and mike and nodded to the bearer. 
The bearer twiddled the dials. 

"Extrone. Eh? . . . Oh, you got 
their ship. Well, why in hell bother 
me? . . . All right, so they found 
out I was here. You got them, 
didn't you?" 

Blasted them right out of 
space," the voice crackled excitedly. "Right in the middle of a radio 
broadcast, sir.'' 

"I don't want to listen to your 
gabbling when I'm hunting!" Extrone tore off the head-set and 
handed it to the bearer. "If they 
call back, find out what they want, 
first. I don't want to be bothered 
unless it's important." 

"Yes, sir." 
' Extrone squinted up at the sun; 
his eyes crinkled under the glare, 
and perspiration stood in little 
droplets on the back of his hands. 

Lin, returning to the column, 
threaded his way among reclining 



bearers. He stopped before Extrone 
and tossed his hair out of his eyes. 
"I located a spoor," he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. 
"About a quarter ahead. It looks 
fresh." 

Extrone's eyes lit with passion. 

Lin's face was red with heat fetid 
grimy with sweat. "There were 
two, I think." 

"Two?" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. "You and I better 
go forward and look at the spoor." 

Lin said, "We ought to take 
protection, if you're going, too." 

Extrone laughed. "This is 
enough/' He gestured with the rifle 
and stood up. 

"T wish you had let me bring a 
gun along, sir," Lin said. 

"One is enough in my camp." 

THE two of them went forward, 
alone, into the forest. Extrone 
moved agilely through the tangle, 
following Lin closely. When they 
came to the tracks, heavily pressed 
into drying mud around a small 
watering hole, Extrone nodded his 
head in satisfaction. 

"This way," Lin said, pointing, 
and once more the two of them 
Started off. 

They went a good distance 
through the forest, Extrone becoming more alert with each additional 
foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with 
a restraining hand. "They may be 
quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought 
to bring up the column?" 

The farn beast, somewhere be

yond a ragged clump of bushes, 
coughed. Extrone clenched the blast 
rifle convulsively. 

The farn beast coughed again, 
more distant this time. 

"They're moving away," Lin said, 

"Damn!" Extrone said. 

"It's a good thing the wind's 
right, or 'they'd be coming back, 
and fast, too." 

"Eh?" Extrone said. 

"They charge on scent, sight, or 
sound. I understand they will track 
down a man for as long as a day." 

"Wait," Extrone said, combing 
his beard. "Wait a minute." 

"Yes?" 

"Look," Extrone said. "If that's 
the case, why do we bother tracking them? Why not make them 
come to us?" 

"They're too unpredictable. It 
wouldn't be safe. I'd rather have 
surprise on our side." 

"You don't seem to see what I 
mean," Extrone said. "We won't 
be the — ah — the bait." 

"Oh?" 

"Let's get back to the column.'* 

"T71XTRONE wants to see you," 
-Li Lin said. 

Ri twisted at the grass shoot, 
broke it off, worried and unhappy. 
"What's he want to see me for?" 

"I don't know," Lin said curtly. 

Ri got to his feet. One of his 
hands reached out, plucked nervously at Lin's bare forearm. "Look," 
he whispered. "You know him. I 
have — a little .money. If you were 



able to . . . if he wants," Ri 
gulped, "to do anything to me — 
I'd pay you, if you could . . ." 

"You better come along," Lin 
said, turning. 

Ri rubbed his hands along his 
thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound, 
ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to 
where Extrone was seated, petting 
his rifle. 

Extrone nodded genially. "The 
farn beast hunter, eh?" 
"Yes, sir." 

Extrone drummed his fingers on 
the stock of the blast rifle. "Tell me 
what they look like," he said suddenly. 

"Well, sir, they're . . . uh . . ." 
"Pretty frightening?" 
"No, sir . . . Well, in a way, 
sir." 

"But you weren't afraid ot them, 
were you?" 

"No, sir. No, because . . ." 

Extrone was smiling innocently. 
"Good. 1 want you. to do something for me." 

. "I ... I ..." Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his 
eye. Lin's face was impassive. 

"Of course you will," Extrone 
said genially. "Get me a rope, Lin. 
A good, long, strong rope." 

"What are you going to do?" 
Ri asked, terrified. 

"Why, I'm going to tie the rope 
around your waist and stake you 
out as bait." 

"No!" 

"Oh, come now. When the farn 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



beast hears you scream — you am 
scream, by the way?"' 
Ri swallowed. 

"We could find a. way to make 
you." 

There was perspiration trickling 
down Ri's forehead, a single drop, 
creeping toward his nose. 

"You'll be safe," Extrone said, 
studying his face with amusement. 
"I'll shoot the an i mal before it 
reaches you." 

Ri gulped for air. "But ... it 
there should be more than one?" 

Extrone shrugged. 

"I — Look, sir. Listen to me." 
Ri's lips were bloodless and his 
hands were trembling. "It's not me 
you want to do this to. It's Mia, 
sir. He killed a farn beast before / 
did, sir. And last night — last night, 
he—" 

"He what?" Extrone demanded, 
leaning forward intently. 

Ri breathed with a gurgling 
sound. "He said he ought to kill 
you, sir. That's what he said. I 
heard him, sir. He said he ought 
to kill you. He's the one you ought 
to use for bait. Then if there was 
an accident, sir, it wouldn't matter, 
because he said he ought to kill 
you. I wouldn't . . ." 

Extrone said, "Which one- is 
he?" 

"That one. Right over there." 

"The one with his back to me?" 

"Yes, sir. That's him. That's 
him, sir." 

Extrone aimed carefully and 
fired, full charge, then lowered the 



rifle and said, "Here comes Lin 
with the rope, I see." 

Ri was greenish. "You . . . 
you . . ." 

Extrone turned to Lin. "Tic one 
end around his waist." 

"Wait," Ri begged, fighting off 
the rope with his hands. "You 
don't want to use me, sir. Not after 
I told you . . . Please, sir. If anything should happen to me . . . 
Please, sir. Don't do it." 

"Tic it," Extrone ordered. 

"No, sir. Please. Oh, please 
don't, sir." 

"Tie it," Extrone said inexorably. 

Lin bent with the rope; his facewas colorless. 

THEY were at the watering hole 
— Extrone, Lin, two bearers, 
and Ri. 

Since the hole was drying, the 
left, partially exposed bank was 
steep toward the muddy water. 
Upon it was green, new grass, tcnder-tuffed, half mashed in places 
by heavy animal treads. It was there 
that they staked him out, tying the 
free end of the rope tightly around 
the base of a scaling tree. 

"You will scream," Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed 
across the water hole. "The farn 
beast will come from this direction, 
I imagine." 

Ri was almost slobbering in fear. 

"Let me hear you scream," Extrone said. 

Ri moaned weakly.

"You'll have to do better than 
that." Extrone inclined his head 
toward a bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see. 

Ri screamed. 

"See that you keep it up that 
way," Extrone said. "That's the way 
I want you to sound." He turned 
toward Lin. "We can climb this 
tree, I think." 

Slowly, aided by the bearers, the 
two men climbed the tree, bark 
peeling away from under their 
rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly. 

Once at the crotch, Extrone 
settled down, holding the rifle at 
. alert. Lin moved to the left, out on 
the main branch, rested in a smaller 
crotch. 

Looking down, Extrone said, 
"Scream!" Then, to Lin, "You feel 
the excitement? It's always in the 
air like this at a hunt." 

"I feel it," Lin said. 

Extrone chuckled. "You were 
with me on Meizque?" 

"Yes." 

"That was something, that time." 
He ran his hand along the stock 
of the weapon, 

The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled 
Extrone's head. He slapped at it, 
angry. The forest was quiet, underlined by an occasional piping call, 
something like a whistle. Ri's 
screams were shrill, echoing away, 
shiveringly. Tin sat quiet, hunched. 

Extrone's eyes narrowed, and 
he began to pet the gun stock 

HUNT THE HUNTER 



with quick, jerky movements. Lin 
licked his lips, keeping his eyes on 
Extrone's face. The sun seemed 
stuck in the sky, and the beat 
squeezed against them, sucking at 
their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away. Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed. 

AFARN beast coughed, far in 
the matted forest. 
Extrone laughed nervously. "He 
must have heard." 

"We're lucky to rouse one so 
fast," Lin said. 

Extrone dug his boot cleats into 
the tree, braced himself. "I like 
this. There's more excitement in 
waiting like this than in anything 
I know." 
Lin nodded. 

"The waiting, itself, is a lot. The 
suspense. It's not only the killing 
that matters." 

"It's not only the killing," Lin 
echoed. 

"You understand?" Extrone said. 
"How it is to wait, knowing in 
just a minute something is going 
to come out of the forest, and 
you're going to kill it?" 

"I know," Lin said. 

"But it's not only the killing. 
It's the waiting, too." 

The farn beast coughed again; 
nearer. 

"It's a different one," Lin said. 
"How do you know?" 
"Hear the lower pitch, the more 
of a roar?" 

"Hey!" Extrone shouted. "You,

down there. There are two coming. 
Now let's hear you really scream!" 

Ri, below, whimpered childishly 
and began to retreat toward the 
tether tree, his eyes wide. 

"There's a lot of satisfaction in 
fooling them, too," Extrone said. 
"Making them come to your bait, 
where you can get at them." He 
opened his right hand. "Choose 
your ground, set your trap. Bait 
it.*' He snapped his hand into a 
fist, held the fist up before his eyes, 
imprisoning the idea. "Spring the 
trap when the quarry is inside. 
Clever. That makes the waiting 
more interesting. Waiting to see if 
they really will come to your bait." 

Lin shifted, staring toward the 
forest. 

"I've always liked to hunt," Estrone said. "More than anything 
else, I think." 

Lin spat tow a rd th e gro u nd . 
"People should hunt because they 
have to. For food. For safety." 

"No," Extrone argued. "People 
should hunt for the love of hunting-" 

"Killing?" 

"Hunting," Extrone repeated 
harshly. 

TH E f am beast coughed. Another answered. They were 
very near, and there was a noise of 
crackling underbrush. 

"He's good bait," Extrone said. 
"He's fat enough and he knows 
how to scream good." 

Ri had stopped screaming; he 



was huddled against the tree, fearfully eying the forest across from 
the watering hole. 

Extrone began to tremble* with 
excitement. "Here they come!" 

The forest sprang apart. Extrone 
bent forward, the gun still across 
his lap. 

.The farn beast, its tiny eyes red 
with hate, stepped out on the bank, 
swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed. 
Its mate appeared beside it. Their 
tails* thrashed against the scrubs behind them, rattling leaves. 

"Shoot!" Lin hissed. "For God's 
sake, shoot!" 

"Wait," Extrone said. "Let's see 
what they do." He had not moved 
the rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath 
beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump. 

The lead farn beast sighted Ri. 
It lowered its head. 

"Look!" Extrone cried excitedly. "Here it comes!" 

Ri began to scream again. 

Still Extrone did not lift his blast 
rifle. He was laughing. Lin waited, 
frozen, his eyes staring at the farn 
beast in fascination. 

The farn beast plunged into the 
water, which was shallow, and, 
throwing a sheet of it to either side, 
headed across toward Ri. 

"Watch! Watch!" Extrone cried 
gleefully. 

And then the aliens sprang their 
trap.
