angel's egg BY EDGAR PANGBORN 

MR. Cleveland MeCarran 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 

Washington, D. C. 

Dear Sir: 

In compliance with your request, 
I enclose herewith a transcript of 
the pertinent sections of the journal 
of Dr. David Bannerman, deceased. 
The original document is being 



held at this office until proper disposition can be determined. 

Our investigation has shown no 
connection between Dr. Bannerman 
and any organization, subversive or 
otherwise. So far as we can learn 
he was exactly what he seemed, an 
inoffensive summer resident, retired, 
with a small independent income — 
a recluse to some extent, but well 


spoken of by local tradesmen and 
other neighbors. A connection between Dr. Bannerman and the type 
of activity that concerns your Department would seem most unlikely. 

The following information is 
summarized from the earlier parts 
of Dr. Bannerman's journal, and 
tallies with the results of our own 
limited inquiry. 

He was born in 1898 at Springfield, Massachusetts, attended public school there, and was graduated 
from Harvard College in 1922, his 
studies having been interrupted by 
two years' military sen-ice. He was 
wounded in action in the Argonne, 
receiving a spinal injury. He earned 
a doctorate in Biology, 1926. Delayed after-effects of his war injury 
necessitated hospitalization. 1927'28. From 1929 to 1948 he taught 
elementary sciences in a private 
school in Boston. He published two 
textbooks in introductory biology, 
1929 and 1937. In 1948 he retired 
from teaching: a pension and a 
modest income from textbook royalties evidently made this possible. 

Aside from the spinal injury, 
which caused him to walk with a 
stoop, his health is said to have 
been fair. Autopsy findings suggested that the spinal condition 
must have given him considerable 
pain; he is not known to have mentioned this to anyone, not even his 
physician, Dr. Lester Morse. There 
is no evidence whatever of drug 
addiction or alcoholism. 



At one point early in his journal. 
Dr. Bannerman describes himself 
as "a naturalist of the puttering 
type. I would rather sit on a log 
than write monographs; it pays off 
better." Dr. Morse, and others who 
knew Dr. Bannerman personally, 
tell me that this conveys a hint of 
his personality. 

I AM not qualified to comment on 
the material of this journal, except to say that I have no evidence 
to support (or to contradict) Dr. 
Bannerman's statements. The journal has been studied only by my 
immediate superiors, by Dr. Morse, 
and by myself. I take it for granted 
you will hold the matter in strictest 
confidence. 

With the journal I am also enclosing a statement by Dr. Morse, 
written at my request for our records and for your information. You 
will note that he says, with some 
qualifications, that "death was not 
inconsistent with an embolism." Hehas signed a death certificate on 
that basis. You will recall from 
my letter of August 5 that" it was 
Dr. Morse who discovered Dr. 
Bannerman's body. Because he was 
a close personal friend of the deceased, Dr. Morse did not feel able 
to perform the autopsy himself. It 
was done by a Dr. Stephen Clyde 
of this city, and was virtually negative as regards cause of death, 
neither confirming nor contradicting Dr. Morse's original tentative 
diagnosis. If you wish to read the 



20 




 



autopsy report in full, I shall be 
glad to forward a copy. 

Dr. Morse tells me that so far as 
he knows, Dr. Bannerman had no 
near relatives. He never married. 
For the last twelve summers he 
occupied a small cottage on a back 
road about twenty-five miles from 
this city, and had few visitors. The 
neighbor Steele mentioned in the 
journal is a farmer, age 68, of good 
character, who tells me he "never 
got really acquainted with Dr. Bannerman." 

At this office we feel that unless new information comes to 
light, further active Investigation is 
hardly justified. 

Respectfully yours, 
Garrison Blaine

EXTRACT FROM JOURNAL 
OF DAVID BANNERMAN 
JUNE 1 — JULY 29, 195 L 

IT MUST have been at least threeweeks ago when we had that 
flying saucer flurry. Observers the 
other side of Katahdin saw it come 
down this side; observers this side 
saw it come down the other. Size 
anywhere from six inches to sixty 
feet in diameter (or was it cigarshaped?) and speed whatever you 
please. Seem to recall that witnesses 
agreed on a rosy-pink light. There 
was the inevitable gobbledegookery 
of official explanation designed to 
leave everyone impressed, soothed 
and disappointed. 

I paid scant attention to the excitement and less to the explanations — naturally, I thought it 
just a flying saucer. But now 
milla has hatched out an angel. 

I have eight hens, all yearlings 
except Camilla; this is her third 
spring. I boarded her two winters 
at my neighbor Steele's farm when 
I closed this shack and shuffled my 
chilly bones off to Florida, because 
even as a pullet she had a manner 
which overbore me. I could never 
have eaten Camilla. If she had 
looked at the ax with that same expression of rancid disapproval (and 



ANGEL'S EGG 



she would ) I should have felt I 
was beheading a favorite aunt. Her 
only concession to sentiment is the 
annual rush of maternity to the 
brain — normal, for a case-hardened 
White Plymouth Rock. 

This year she stole a nest successfully, in a tangle of blackberry. 
By the time I located it, I estimated 
I was about two weeks too late. I 
had to outwit her by watching from 
a window; she is far too acute to 
be openly trailed from feeding 
ground to nest. When I had bled 
and pruned my way to her hideout, 
she wis sitting on nine eggs and 
hating my guts. They could not be 
fertile, since I keep no rooster, and 
I was about to rob her when I saw 
th e n in th egg was n ot he rs , nor 
any other chicken's. 

XT WAS a deep blue, transparent, 
A with flecks of inner light 
that made me think of the first stars 
in a clear evening. It was the same 
size as Camilla's eggs. There was 
an embryo, but nothing I could 
recognize. 

I returned the egg to Camilla's 
bare and fevered breastbone, and 
went back to the house for a long 
cool drink. I 
That was ten days ago. I know 
I ought to hare kept a record; I 
examined the blue egg every day, 
watching how some nameless lifegrew within it, until finally the 
angel chipped the shell deftly in 
two parts. This was evidently done 
with the aid of small horny out


growths on her elbows; these 
growths were sloughed off on the 
second day. 

I wish I had seen her break the 
shell, but when I visited the black- \ 
berry tangle three days ago she was 
already out. She poked her exquisite head through Camilla's neck 
feather, smiled sleepily, and snuggled back into darkness to finish 
drying off. So what could 1 do, more 
than save the broken shell and 
wriggle my clumsy self out of 
there ? 

I had removed Camilla's own 
eggs the day before — Camilla was 
only moderately annoyed. I was 
nervous about disposing of them 
even though they were obviously 
Camilla's, but no harm was done. 
I cracked each one to be sure. Very 
frankly rotten eggs and nothing 
more. 

In the evening of that day I 
thought of rats and weasels, as I 
should have earlier. I hastily prepared a box in the .kitchen and 
brought the two in, the angel quiet 
in my closed hand. They are there 
now. I think they are comfortable. 

■Three days after hatching, the " 
angel is the length of my forefinger, say three inches tall, with 
about the relative proportions of a 
six-year-old girl. Except for head, 
hands, and probably the soles of 
her feet, she is clothed in feathery 
down (lie color of ivory. What can 
be seen of her skin is a glowing 
pink — I do mean glowing, like the 
inside of certain seashells. Just

ANGEL'S EGG 



above the small of her back are 
two stubs which I take to be infantile wings. They do not suggest an 
extra pair of specialized forelimbs. 
I think they are wholly differentiated organs; perhaps they will be 
like the wings of an insect. Somehow I never thought of angels 
bu22ing. Maybe she won't. 1 know 
ver.y little about angels. 

AT PRESENT the stubs are covered with some dull tissue, 
no doubt a protective sheath to be 
discarded when the membranes (if 
they are membranes) are ready to 
grow. Between the stubs is a not 
very prominent ridge — special musculature, I suppose. Otherwise her 
shape is quite human, even to a 
pair of minuscule mammalian pinheads just visible under the down. 

How that can make sense in an 
egg-laying organism is beyond my 
comprehension. Just for the record, 
so is a Corot landscape; so is Schubert's Unfinished; so is the flight 
of a hummingbird, or the otherworld of frost on a windowpane. 

The down on her head has grown 
visibly in three days and is of different quality from the body down. 
Later it may resemble human hair, 
probably as a diamond resembles a 
chunk of granite . . . 

A curious thing has happened. 
I went to Camilla's box after writing that. Judy* was already lying 
in front of it, unexcited. The 
angel's head was out from under 
the feathers, and I thought, with 



more verbal distinctness than such 
thoughts commonly take, So here J 
am, a naturalist of middle years and 
cold sober, observing a three-inch 
oviparous mammal with down and 
wings. 

The thing is — she giggled! 

Now it might have been only 
amusement at my appearance, which 
to her must be enormously gross 
and comic. But another thought 
formed unspoken: / am no longer 
lonely. And her face, hardly bigger 
than a dime, immediately changed 
from laughter to a brooding and 
friendly thoughtfulness. 

Judy and Camilla are old friends. 
Judy seems untroubled by the 
angel. I have no worries about leaving them alone together. 

June 3 

I MADE no entry last night. The 
angel was talking to me, and 
when that was finished I drowsed 
off immediately on a cot which I 
have moved into the kitchen to be 
near them. 

I had never been strongly impressed by the evidence for extrasensory perception. It is fortunate 
that my mind was able to accept 
the novelty, since to the angel it is 
clearly a matter of course. Her tiny 
mouth is most expressive, but 
moves only for that reason and for 
eating — not for speech. Probably 

•Dr. Bannerman's dog, mentioned often 
earlier in die journal, a. nine-year-old 
English setter. According to an entry of 
May 15, 1951, she was then beginning 
to go blind— BLAINE 




 



she could speak to her own kind 
if she wished, but I dare say the 
sound would be above the range of 
my hearing as well as my understanding. 

Last night after I brought the cot 
in and was about to finish my puttering bachelor supper, she climbed 
to the edge of the box and pointed, 
first at herself and then at the top 
of the kitchen table. Afraid to let 
my vast hand take hold of her, I 
held it out flat and she sat in my 
palm. Camilla was inclined to fuss, 
but the angel looked over her shoulder and Camilla subsided, watchful 
but no longer alarmed. 

The table-top is porcelain, and 
the angel shivered. I folded a towel 
and spread a silk handkerchief on 
top of that; the angel sat on this 
arrangement with apparent comfort, 
near my face. I was not even bewildered, without realizing why. 
That doesn't seem possible, does 
it ? But there was a good reason. 

She reached me first with visual 
imagery. How can I make it plain 
that this had nothing in common 
with my sleeping dreams? There 
was no weight of symbolism from 
my littered past, no discoverable 
connection with any of yesterday's 
commonplaces, indeed no actual involvement of my personality at all. 
I saw. I was moving vision, though 
without eyes or other flesh. And 
while my mind saw, it also knew 
where my flesh was. seated at the 
kitchen table. If anyone had entered 
the kitchen, it there had been a 



noise of alarm out in the henhouse, 
I should have known it. 

THERE was a valley such as I 
have not seen, and never will, 
on Earth. I have seen many beautiful places on this planet — some of 
them were even tranquil. Once I 
took a slow steamer to New Zealand and had the Pacific as a play 
thing for many days. I can hardly 
say how I knew this was not Earth. 
The grass of the valley was a 
familiar green. A river below me 
was a blue and silver thread under 
sunlight. There were trees much 
like pine and maple, and maybe 
that is what they were. But it was 
not Earth. I was aware of mountains heaped to strange heights on 
cither side of the valley — snow, 
rose, amber, gold. The amber tint 
was unlike any mountain color I 
have noticed in this world at midday. 

Or I may have known it was not 
Earth, simply because her mind — 
dwelling within some unimaginable 
brain smaller than the tip of my 
little finger — told me so. 

I watched two inhabitants of that 
world come flying, to rest in the 
field of sunny grass where my bodiless vision had brought me. Adul; 
forms, such as my angel would 
surely be when she had her growth, 
except that both of these were male 
and one of them was dark-skinned. 
The latter was also old, with a 
thousand-wrinkled face, knowing 
and full of tranquiUity; the other 



ANGEL'S EGG 



23 



was flushed and lively with youth. 
Both were beautiful. The down of 
the brown-skinned old one was 
reddish-tawny; the other's was 
ivory with hints of orange. Their 
wings were true membranes, with 
more variety of subtle iridescence 
than I have seen even in the wings 
of a dragon-fly; I could not say 
that any color was . dominant, for 
each motion brought a ripple of 
change. 

These two sat at their ease on 
the grass. I realized that they were 
talking to each other, though their 
lips did not move in speech more 
than once or twice. They would 
nod, smile, now and then illustrate 
something with twinkling hands. 

A huge rabbit lolloped past them. 
I knew — thanks to my own angel's 
efforts, I supposed — that this animal was of the same size as oxtr 
common wild ones. Later a bluegreen snake three times the size of 
the angels came flowing through 
the grass. The old one reached out 
to stroke its head carelessly, and I 
think he did it without interrupting whatever he was saying. 

Another creature came in leisured 
leaps. He was monstrous, yet I felt 
no .alarm in the angels or myself. 
Imagine a being built somewhat 
like a kangaroo up to the head, 
about eight feet tall, and katydidgreen. Really the thick balancing 
tail and enormous legs were the 
only kangaroolike features about 
him. The body above the massive 
thighs was not dwarfed, but thick 



and square. The arms and hands 
were quite humanoid, and the head 
was round, manlike except for its 
face — there was only a single 
nostril and his mouth was set in 
the vertical. The eyes were large 
and mild. 

I received an impression of high 
intelligence and natural gentleness. 

In one of his manlike hands he 
carried two tools, so familiar and 
ordinary that I knew my body by 
the kitchen table had laughed in 
startled recognition. But after all, 
a garden spade and rake are basic. 
Once invented — -I expect we did it 
ourselves in the Neolithic — there is 
little reason why they should change 
much down the millennia. 

This farmer halted by the angels, 
and the three conversed a while. 
The big head nodded agreeably. I 
believe the young angel made a 
j oke ; certainly the convuls ions in 
the huge green face ma.de me think 
of laughter. Then this amiable 
monster turned up the grass in a 
patch a few yards square, broke the 
sod and raked the surface smooth, 
just as any competent gardener 
might do, except that he moved 
with the relaxed smoothness of a 
being whose strength far exceeds 
the requirements of his task . . . 

I WAS back in my kitchen with 
everyday eyes. My angel was 
exploring the table. I had a loaf 
of bread there, and a dish of strawberries in cream. She was trying a 
breadcrumb, seemed to like it fair



 



ly well. I offered the strawberries. 
She broke off one of the seeds and 
nibbled it, but didn't care so much 
for the pulp. I held xip the great 
spoon with sugary cream. She 
steadied it with both hands to try 
some. I think she liked it. 

It had been stupid of me not to 
realize that she would be hungry. 
I brought wine from the cupboard; 
she watched inquiringly, so I put a 
couple of drops on the handle of a 
spoon. The taste really pleased her. 
She chuckled and patted her tiny 
stomach, though I'm afraid it 
wasn't very good sherry. I brought 
some crumbs of cake, but she indicated that she was full, came 
close to my face and motioned me 
to lower my head. 

She reached up until she could 
press both hands against my forehead — I felt it only enough to know 
her hands were there — and she 
stood so a long time, trying to tell 
me something. 

It was difficult. Pictures come 
through with relative ease, but now 
she was transmitting an abstraction of a complex kind. My clumsy 
brain suffered in the effort to receive. Something did come across, 
but I have only the crudest way of 
passing it on. Imagine an equilateral 
triangle; place the following words 
one at each corner — "recruiting," 
"collecting," "saving." The meaning she wanted to convey ought to 
be near the center of the triangle. 

I had also the sense that her 
message provided a partial explana


tion of her errand in this lovable 
and damnable world. 

She looked weary when she stood 
away from me. I put out my palm 
and she climbed into it, to be carried back to the nest. 

She did not talk to me tonight, 
nor eat, but she gave a reason, coming out from Camilla's feathers 
long enough to turn her back and 
show me the wing-stubs. The protective sheaths have dropped off; 
the wings are rapidly growingHiey are probably damp and weak. 
. She was quite tired and went back 
into the warm darkness almost ai 
once. 

Camilla must be exhausted. 
I don't think she has been off 
nest more than twice since I bro 
them into the house.

June 4 

rpODAY she can fly. 
-L I learned it in the afternoon, 
when I was fiddling about in the 
garden and Judy was loafing in the 
sunshine she loves. Something apart 
from sight and sound called me to 
hurry back to the house. I saw my 
angel through the screen door before I opened it. One of her feet 
had caught in a hideous loop of 
loose wire at a break in the mesh. 
Her first tug of alarm must have 
tightened the loop so that her hands 
were not strong enough to force it 
open. 

Fortunately I was able to cut the 
wire with a pair of shears before I 
lost my head; then she could free 



ANGEL'S EGG

her foot -without injury. Camilla 
had been frantic, rushing around 
fluffed up, but- — here's an odd thing 
- — perfectly silent. None of the 
recognized chicken -noises of dismay. If an ordinary chick had been 
in trouble, she would have raised 
the roof. 

THE angel flew to me and hovered, pressing her hands on my, 
forehead. The message was clear at 
once: "No harm done." She flew 
down to tell Camilla the same 
thing. 

Yes, in the same way. I saw Camilla standing near my feet with 
her neck out and head low, and the 
angel put a hand on either side of 
her scraggy comb. Camilla relaxed, 
clucked in the normal way, and 
;prcad her wings for a shelter. The 
angel went under it, but only to 
oblige Camilla, I think — at least, 
she stuck her head through the 
•wing feathers and winked. 

She must have seen something 
else then, for she came out and 
flew back to me and touched a 
finger to my cheek, looked at the 
finger, saw it was wet, put it in her 
mouth, made a face, and laughed 
at me. 

We went outdoors into the sun 
(Camilla, too) and the angel gave 
me an exhibition of what flying 
ought to be. Not even Wagner can 
speak of joy as her first free flying 
did. At one moment she would be 
hanging in front of my eyes, radiant and delighted; the next instant 



she wbuld be a dot of color against 
a cloud. Try to imagine something 
that would make a hummingbird 
seem dull and sluggish! 

They do hum. Softer than a 
hummingbird; louder than a 
dragonfly. Something like the sound 
of hawk-moths — He maris tb/sbc, 
for instance, the one I used to call 
Hummingbird Moth when I was a 
child. 

I was frightened, naturally. 
Frightened first at what might 
happen to her, but that was unnecessary; I don't think she would 
be in danger from any savage animal except possibly Man. I saw a 
Cooper's hawk slant down the invisible toward the swirl of color 
where she was dancing by herself. 
Presently she was drawing iridescent 
rings around him. Then, while he 
soared in smaller circles, I could 
not see her, but . (maybe she felt 
my fright) she was again in front 
of me, pressing my forehead in the 
now familiar way. 

I knew she was amused, and 
caught the idea that the hawk was 
a "lazy character." Not quite the 
way I'd describe Accipiter Cooper's, 
but it's all in the point of view. I 
believe she had been riding his 
back, no doubt with her telepathic 
hands on his predatory head. 

Later I was frightened by the 
thought that she might not want to 
return to me. Could I compete with 
sunlight and open sky? The passage 
of that terror through me brought 
her swiftly back, and her hands

said with great clarity: "Don't ever 
be afraid of anything. It isn't nec- ' 
cssary for you." 

Once this afternoon I was 
saddened by the realization that old 
Judy can take little part in what 
goes on now. I can well remember 
Judy running Jike the wind. The 
angel must have heard this thought 
in me, fo£ she stood a long time 
beside Judy's drowsy head, while 
Judy's tail thumped cheerfully on 
the warm grass . . . 

IN THE evening the angel made 
a heavy meal on two or three 
cake crumbs and another drop of 
sherry, and we had what was almost a sustained conversation. I 
will write it in that form this time, 
rather than grope for anything more 
exact. 

1 asked her: "How far away is 
your home?" 

"My home is here." 

"I meant the place your people 
came from." 

"Ten light years." 

"Hie images you showed me — 
that quiet valley — that is ten light 
years away?" 

"Yes. But that was my father 
talking to you, through me. He 
was grown when the journey began. He is two hundred and forty 
years old — our years, thirty-two 
days longer than each of yours." 

Mainly I was conscious of a 
flood of relief. T had feared, on 
the basis of terrestrial biology*, that 
her explosively rapid growth after 



hatching must foretell a brief life. 
But it's all right — she can outlive 
me, and by a few hundred years at 
that. 

"Your father is here now, on 
this planet? Shall I see him?" 

She took her hands away — 
listening, I believe. Hie answer 
was: "No. He is sorry. He is ill 
and cannot live long. I am to sec 
him in a few days, when I fly a 
little better. He taught me for 
twenty years after I was born." 

"I don't understand. I thought 
that — " 

"Later, friend. My father is 
grateful for your kindness to me." 

I don't know what I thought 
about that. I felt no faintest trace 
of condescension in the message. 

"And he was showing me things 
he had seen with his own eyes, ten 
light years away?" 

"Yes." Then she wanted me to 
rest a while; I am sure she knows 
what a huge effort it is for my 
primitive brain to function in this 
way. But before she ended the conversation by humming down to her 
nest she gave me this, and I received it with such clarity that I 
cannot be mistaken : "He says that 
only fifty million years ago it was 
a jungle there, just as Terra is 
now." 

June 8 

WHEN I woke four days ago, 
the angel was having breakfast, and little Camilla was dead. 
The angel watched me rub sleep

out of my eyes, watched me discover Camilla, and then flew to me. 

I received this: "Docs it make 
you unhappy?" 

"I don't know exactly." You can 
get fond of a hen, especially a cantankerous and homely old one 
whose personality has a lot in common with your own. 

"She was old. She wanted a flock 
of chicks, and I couldn't stay with 
her. So I — ' ' something obscure 
here;, probably my mind was trying 
too hard to grasp it — -"so I saved 
her life." I could make nothing 
else out of it. She said "saved." 

Camilla's death looked natural, 
except that I should have expected 
the death contractions to muss the 
straw and that hadn't happened. 
Maybe the angel had arranged the 
old lady's body for decorum, 
though I don't sec how her muscular strength would have been 
equal to it, Camilla weighed at least 
seven pounds. 

As I was burying her at the edge 
of the garden and the angel was 
humming over my head, I recalled 
a thing which, when it happened, 
I had dismissed as a dream. Merely 
a moonlight image of the angel 
standing in the. nest box with her 
hands on Camilla's head, then pressing her mouth gently on Camilla's 
throat, just' before the hen's head 
sank down out of my line of vision. 
Probably I actually awoke and saw 
it happen. I am somehow unconcerned — even, as I think more about 
it, pleased. 



After the burial the angel's 
hands said: "Sit on the grass and 
we'll talk. Question me; I'll tell you 
what I can. My father asks you to 
write it down.'' 

So that is what we have been 
doine, for the last four days. I have 
been going to school, a slow but 
willing pupil. Rather than enter 
anything in this" journal,' for in the 
evenings I was exhausted, I made 
notes as best I could. The angel has 
gone now to see her father and 
will nof return until morning. I 
shall try to make a readable version 
of my notes. 

Since she had invited questions, 
I began with something which had 
been bothering me, as a would-be 
naturalist, exceedingly. I couldn't 
see how creatures no larger than 
the adults I had observed could lay 
eggs, as large as Camilla's. Nor 
could I understand why, if they 
were hatched in an almost adult 
condition and able to eat a varied 
diet, she had any use for that 
ridiculous, lovely and apparently 
functional pair of breasts. 

WHEN the angel grasped my 
difficulty, she exploded with 
laughter — her kind, which buzzed 
her all over the garden and caused 
her to fluff my hair on the wing 
and pinch my carlobe. She lit on a 
rhubarb leaf and gave a delcctably 
naughty representation of herself as 
a hen laying an egg, including the 
cack 1 e . She got m c to bumbl i ng 
helplessly— my kind of laughter— 


 



and it was some time before we 
couUl quiet down. Then she did 
her best to explain. 

They are true mammals, and the 
young — not more than two or at 
most three in a lifetime averaging 
two hundred and fifty years— arc 
delivered in very much the human 
way. The baby is nursed, human 
fashion, until his brain begins to 
respond .1 little to their unspoken 
language. That takes three to four 
yreeks. Then he is placed in an altogether different medium. 

She could not describe that clearly, because there was very little in 
my educational storehouse to help 
me grasp it. It is some gaseous medium which arrests bodily growth 
for an almost indefinite period, 
while mental growth continues. It 
took them, she says, about seven 
thousand years to perfect this 
technique after they first hit on the 
idea; they are never in a hurry. 

The infant remains under this 
delicate and precise control tor anywhere from fifteen to thirty years, 
the period depending not only on 
his mental vigor, but also on the 
type of lifcwork he tentatively 
elects as soon as his brain is knowing enough to make a choice. During this period his mind is guided 
with patience by teachers who — 

IT SEEMS those teachers know 
their business. This was peculiarly difficult for me to assimilate, although the facts came through 
clearly enough. In their world, the 



profession of teacher is more highly honored than any other — can 
such a thing be possible? — and so 
difficult to enter that only the 
strongest minds dare to attempt it. 

I had to rest a while after absorbing that. 

An aspirant must spend fifty 
years, not including the period of 
infantile education, merely getting 
ready to begin, and the acquisition 
of factual knowledge, while not 
undcrstressed, takes only a small 
proportion of those fifty years. 
Then, if he's good enough, he can 
take a small part in the elementary 
instruction of a few babies, and if 
he does well on that basis for another thirty or forty years, he is 
considered a fair beginner ... 

Once upon a time I myself 
lurched around stuffy classrooms, 
trying to insert a few predigested 
facts — I wonder how many of them 
were facts — into the minds of bored 
and preoccupied adolescents, *;ome 
of whom may have liked me moderately wcl 1 . I was even abl e to 
shake hands and be nice while their 
terribly well-meaning parents explained to me how they ought to 
be educated. So much of our human 
effort goes down the drain of futility, I sometimes wonder how wc 
ever got as far as the Bronze Age. 
Somehow we did, "though, and a 
short way beyond. 

After that preliminary stage of 
an angel's education is finished, the 
baby is transferred to more ordinary 
surroundings, and his bodily 



ANGEL'S EGG 



31 



growth completes itself in a very 
short time. Wings grow abruptly, 

as I have seen, and he reaches a 
maximum height of six inches by 
our measure. Only then docs he 
enter on that lifetime of two hundred and fifty years, for not until 
then dots his body begin to age. 
My angel has been a living personality for many years, but will not 
celebrate her first birthday for almost a year. I like to think of that. 

At about the same time that they 
learned the principles of interplanetary travel, approximately 
twelve million years ago, these people also learned how growth could 
be rearrested at any point short of 
full maturity. At first the knowledge served no purpose except in 
the control of illnesses which still 
occasionally struck them at that 
time. But when the long periods 
of time required for space travel 
were considered, the advantages 
became obvious. 

SO IT happens that my angel 
was born ten light years away. 
She was trained by her father and 
many others in the wisdom of seventy million years— that, she tells 
me, is the approximate sum of their 
recorded history — and then she was 
safely sealed and .cherished in what 
my supcramebic brain regarded as 
a blue egg. Education did not proceed at that time; her mind went 
to sleep with the rest of her. When 
Camillas warmth made her wake 
and grow again, she remembered 



what to do with the little horny 
bumps provided for her elbows. 
And came out into this planet, God 
help her. 

I wondered why her father 
should have chosen any combination so unreliable as an old hen 
and a human being. Surely he must 
have had plenty of excellent ways 
to bring the shell to the right temperature. Her answer should have 
satisfied me immensely, but I am 
still compelled to wonder about it: 

"Camilla was a nice hen, and 
my father studied your mind while 
you were asleep. It was a bad landing, and much was broken — no 
such landing was ever made before 
after so long a journey. Only four 
other grown-ups could come with 
my father. Three of them died en 
route and he is very ill. And there 
were nine other children to care 
for." 

Yes, I knew she'd said that an 
angel thought I was good enough 
to be trusted with his daughter. If 
it upsets me. all I need do is look 
at her and then in the mirror. As 
for the explanation, 1 can only conclude there must be more which I 
am not ready to understand. I was 
worried about thjose nine others, 
but she assured mc they were all 
well, and I sensed that 1 ought not 
to ask more about them at present. 

THEIR planet, she says, is closely similar to this, a trifle larger, 
moving in a somewhat longer orbit 
around a sun like ours. Two gleam


32 




 



ing moons, smaller than ours — their 
orbits arc .such that two-moon 
nights come rarely; they are 
"magic, " and she will ask her 
father to show me one, if he can. 
Because of a slower rotation, their 
day has twenty-six of our hours. 
Their atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and oxygen in the proportion 
familiar to us; slightly richer in 
some of the rare gases. The climate 
is now what we should call tropical 
and subtropical, but they have 
known glacial rigors like those in 
our world's past. There arc only two 
great continental land masses, and 
many thousands of large islands. 

Their total population is only 
five billion. 

It seems my angel wants to become a student of animal life here 
on Earth. I, her teacher ! But bless 
her for the notion anyhow. We sat 
and traded animals for a couple of 
hours last night; 1 found it restful, 
after the mental struggle to grasp 
more difficult matters. Judy was 
something new to her. They have 
several luscious monsters on that 
planet, but, in her view, .so have 
we. 

She told me of a blue sea-snake 
fifty feet long, relatively harmless, 
th.il bellows cowlike and comes 
into the tidal marshes to lay black 
eggs; so I gave her a whale. She 
offered a bat-winged, day-flying 
ball of mammalian fluff as big as 
my head and weighing under an 
ounce; I matched her with a marmoset. She tried me with a small


size pink brontosaur, very rare, but 
I was reaJy with the duck-bitted 
platypus, and that caused us to exchange some pretty funny remarks 
about mammalian eggs. All trivial 
in a way; also the happiest evening 
in my fifty-three tangled years of 
life. 

She was a trifle hesitant to explain those kangaroolikc people, 
until she was sure I really wanted 
to know. It seems they arc about 
the nearest parallel to human life 
on that planet; not a near parallel, 
of course, as she was careful to explain. Agreeable and always friendly souls, though they weren't always 
so, I'm sure, and of a somewhat 
more alert intelligence than we 
possess. Manual workers mainly, because they prefer it nowadays, but 
some of them are excellent mathematicians. The first practical spaceship was built by a group of them, 
with assistance, of course. 

Names offer a difficulty. Because 
of the nature of the angelic language, they have scant use for them 
except for the purpose of written 
record, and writing naturally plays 
little part in their daily life- — no 
occasion to write a letter when distance is no obstacle to the speech 
of your mind. An angel's formal 
name is about as important to him, 
as, say, my Social Security number 
is to me. 

SHE has not told me hers, because my mind can't grasp the 
phonetics on which their written 



34 




 



language is based. As we would 
speak a friend's name, an angel 
will project the friend's image to 
his friend's receiving mind. More 
rneasant and more intimate, 1 think, 
although it was a shock to me at 
first to glimpse my own ugly mug 
in my mind's eye. 

Stories arc occasionally written, 
if there is something in them that 
should be preserved precisely as it 
was in the first telling. But in their 
world ihc true story-teller has a 
more important place than the 
printer. He offers one of the best 
of their quieter pleasures; a good 
one can hold his audience for a 
week and never tire them. 

"What is this 'angel' in your 
mind when you think of me?" she 
asked once. 

' ' A being men have imagined 
for cen curies, when they thought 
of themselves as they might like to 
be, and not as they are." 

I did not try too painfully hard 
to learn much about the principles 
of space travel. The most my brain 
could take in of her explanation 
was something like: "Rocket, then 
phototropism." Now that makes 
scant sense. So far as I know, phototropism— movement toward light — 
is an . organic phenomenon. One 
thinks of it as a response of protoplasm, in some plants and animal 
organisms, most of them simple, to 
the stimulus of light; certainly not 
as a force capable of moving inorganic matter. 

I think that whatever may be the 



principle she was describing, this 
word phototropism was merely the 
nearest thing to it in my reservoir 
of language. If I did know the 
physical principles which brought 
them here, and could write them 
in terms accessible to technicians, I 
would not do it. 

Here is a thing I am afraid no 
hypothetical reader of this journal 
would believe: 

These people, as I have written, 
learned their method of space 
travel some twelve million years 
ago, yet this is the first time they 
have ever used it to convey them to 
another planet. The heavens are 
rich in worlds, she tells me; on 
many of them there is life, often 
on very primitive levels. No external force prevented her people 
from going forth, colonizing, conquering, as far as they pleased. 
They could have populated a whole 
Galaxy. They did not, because they 
believed they were not ready. More 
precisely— 

Not good enough! 

ONLY fifty million years ago, by 
her account, did they learn, 
as we may learn eventually, that 
intelligence without goodness is 
worse than high explosive in the 
hands of a baboon. For beings advanced beyond the level of Pithecanthropus, intelligence is a cheap 
commodity — not too hard to develop, hellishly easy to use for unconsidered ends. Whereas goodness 
is not to be achieved without un


ANGELS EGG 



35 



ending effort of tlic hardest kind, 
within the self, whether the self be 
man or angel 

It is clear even, to me that the 
conquest of evil is only one step, 
not the most important. Goodness, 
she tried to tell me, is an altogether 
positive quality; the part of living 
nature that swarms with such monstrosities as cruelty, meanness, bitterness, greed is not to be filled by 
a vacuum when these horrors are 
eliminated. 

Kindness, for only one example. 
Anybody who defines kindness only 
as the absence of cruelty doesn't 
understand the nature of either. 

THEY d!o not aim at perfection, 
these angels, only at the attainable. They passed through 
many millenia while advances in 
technology merely worsened their 
condition and increased the peril 
of self-annihilation. They came 
through that, in time. War was at 
length so far outgrown that its recurrence was impossible, and the 
development of wholly rational beings could begin. Then they were 
ready to start growing up, through 
more millenia of self-searching, 
self -discipline, seeking to earn the 
simple out of the complex, discovering how to use knowledge and 
not be used by it. Even then, of 
course, they slipped back often 
enough. There were what she refers 
to as eras of fatigue. In their dimmer past, they had had many dark 
ages, lost civilizations, hopeful be


ginnings ending in dust. Earlier 
still they had come out of the slime, 
as we did. 

But their period of deepest uncertainty and sternest self -appraisal 
did not come until twelve million 
years ago, when they knew a Universe could be theirs 'for the taking, and knew they were not yet 
good enough. 

They are in no more hurry than 
the stars. She tried to convey something, tentatively, at this point, 
which was ' really beyond both of 
us. It had to do with time (not as 
I understand time) being perhaps 
the most essential attribute of God 
(not as I was ever able to understand that word). Seeing my mental exhaustion, she gave up the 
effort, and later told me that the 
conception was extremely difficult 
for her, too — not only, I gathered, 
because of her youth and relative 
ignorance. There was also a hint 
that her father might not have 
wished her to bring my brain up to 
a hurdle like that one . . . 

Of course they explored. Their 
little spaceships were roaming the 
ether before there was anything 
like man on Earth — roaming and 
listening, observing, recording; 
never entering nor talcing part in. 
the life of any home but their own. 
For five million years they even 
forbade themselves to go beyond 
their own solar system, though it 
would have been easy to do so. 
And in the following seven million 
years, although they traveled to in



 



credible distances, the same stern 
restraint was held in force. 

It was altogether unrelated to 
what we should call fear. That, I 
think, is as extinct in them as hate. 
There was so much to do at home! 
I wish I could- imagine it. They 
mapped the heavens, and played in 
their own sunlight. 

Naturally I cannot tell you what 
goodness is. I know only, moderately well, what it seems to mean 
to us human beings. It appears that 
the best of us can, often with enormous difficulty, however, achieve a 
manner of life in which goodness 
somewhat overbalances our aggressive, hostile tendencies for the 
greater part of the time. We are, 
in other words, a f raction alive ; 
the rest is in the dark. Dante was 
a bitter masochist; Beethoven a 
frantic and miserable snob, Shakespeare wrote potboilers. And 
Christ said: "My Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass from 
me." 

But give us fifty million years — 
I am no pessimist. After all, I've 
watched one-celled organisms on 
the slide, and listened to Brahms' 
Fourth. Night before last I said to 
the angel: "In spite of everything, 
you and I are kindred." 

She granted me agreement. 

June 9 

SHE was lying on my pillow 
this morning so that I could 
see her when 1 awoke. 

Her father has died, and slit was 



with him when it happened. There 
was again that thought-impression 
which I could interpret only to 
mean that his life had been 
"saved." 1 was still sleep-bound 
when my mind asked: "What will 
you do?" 

"Stay with you, if you wish il, 
for the rest of your life." The last 
part of the message was clouded, 
but I am familiar with that now. It 
seems to mean there is some further 
element which eludes me. I could 
not be mistaken about the part I 
did receive. It gives me amazing 
speculations. Being only fifty-three, 
I might live another thirty or forty 
years. 

She was preoccupied this morning, but whatever she felt about 
her father's death that might be 
paralleled by sadness in a human 
being was hidden from me. She 
did say her father was sorry he had 
not been able to -show me a twomoon night. 

One adult, then, remains in this 
world. Except to say that he is two 
hundred years old and full of 
knowledge, and that he endured the 
long journey without serious il! 
effects, she has told me little about 
him. And there are ten children 
including herself. 

Something was sparkling at her 
throat. When she was aware of my 
interest in it, she took it off and I 
fetched a magnifying glass. A necklace; under the glass, much like our 
finest human workmanship, if your 
imagination can reduce it to the 



ANGEL'S EGG 



proper scale. The stones appeared 
similar to the jewels we know; diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, 
the diamonds snapping out every 
color under heaven; but there were 
two or three very dark purple 
Stoa.es unlike anything I know — 
not amethysts, I am sure. The necklace was strung on something more 
slender than cobweb, and the design of the joining clasp was too 
delicate for my glass to help me. 
The necklace had been her 
mother's, she told me. As she put 
it back around her throat, I thought 
I saw the same shy pride that any 
human girl might feel in displaying a new pretty. 

She wanted to show me other 
things she had brought, and flew 
to the table where she had left a 
Sort of satchel an inch and a half 
long — quite a load for her to fly 
with, but the translucent substance 
is so light that when she rested the 
satchel on my finger I scarcely felt 
it. She arranged a few articles eagerly for my inspection, and I put 
the glass to work again. 

One was a jeweled comb; she 
ran it through the down on her 
chest and legs to show me its use. 
There was a set of tools too small 
for the glass to interpret them; I 
learned later they were a sewing 
kit. A book, and some writing instrument much like a metal pencil. 
The book, I understand, is a blank 
record for her to use as needed. 

And finally, when I was fulLy 
awake and dressed and we had fin


ished breakfast, she reached in the 
bottom of the satchel for a parcel 
that was heavy for her and made 
me understand it was a gift for me. 
"My father made it for you, but I 
put in the stone myself, last night." 
She unwrapped it. A ring, precisely 
the size for my little finger. 

IiBROKE down somewhat. She 
understood that, and sat on my 
shoulder patting my earlobe till I 
had command of myself. 

I have no idea what the jewel 
is. It shifts with the light from 
purple to jade green to amber. The 
metal resembles platinum in appearance, except for a tinge of rose at 

certain angles of light. When I 
stare into the stone, I think I see — 
never mind that now. I am not 
ready to write it down, and perhaps 

never will be, unless I am sure. 

We improved our housekeeping, 
later in the morning. I showed her 
over the house. It isn't much — Cape 
Codder, two rooms up and two 1 
down. Every corner interested her, 
and when she found a shocbox in 
the bedroom closet, she asked for 
it. At her direction, I have arranged 
it on a chest near my bed and the 
window which shall be always 
open. She says the mosquitoes will 
not bother me, and I don't doubt 
her. 

I unearthed a white silk scarf for 
the bottom of the box. After ask-' 
ing my permission — as if I could 
want to refuse her anything!- — she 
got her sewing kit and snipped off 



31 




 



a piece of the scarf several inches 
square, folded it on itself several 
times, and sewed it into a narrow 
pillow an inch long. So now she 
has a proper bed and a room of her 
own. I wish I had something less 
coarse than silk, but she insists she's 
pleased with it. 

We have not talked very much 
today. In the afternoon she flew 
Out for an hour's play in the cloudcountry. When s}ie returned, she 
let me know that she needed a long 
sleep. She is still sleeping, I think. 
I am writing this" downstairs, fearing the light might disturb her. 

Is it possible I can have thirty 
or forty years in her company? I 
wonder how teachable my mind 
still is. I seem to be able to assimilate new facts as well as I ever 
could; this ungainly carcass should 
be durable, with reasonable care. 
Of course, facts without a synthesizing imagination are no better 
than scattered bricks, but perhaps 

my imagination — 
I don't know. 

Judy wants out. I shall turn in 
when she conies back. I wonder if 
poor Judy's life could be — the word 
is certainly "saved." I must ask. 

June 10 

LAST night when I stopped 
writing I did go to bed, but I 
was resdess, refusing sleep. At 
some time in the small hours — thorc 
was light from a single moon — she 
flew over to me. The tensions dissolved away like an illness and my 



mind was able to respond with a 
certain calm. 

I made plain that I would never 
willingly part company with her, 
which I am sure she already knew, 
and she gave me to understand that 
there are two alternatives for the 
remainder of my life. The choice, 
she says, is altogether mine, and 1 
must take time to be sure of my 
decision. 

I can live out my natural span, 
whatever it proves to be, and she 
will not leave me for long at any 
time. She will be there to .advise, 
teach, help me in anything good I 
care to undertake. She says she 
would enjoy thi»; for some reason 
she is, as we'd say in our language, 
fond of me. 

Lord, the books I could write! I 
fumble for words now, in the usual 
human way. Whatever 1 put on 
paper is a miserable fraction of the 
potential; the words themselves are 
rarely the right ones. But under 
her guidance — 

I could take a fair part in shaking the world. With words alone. 
I could preach to my owq people. 
Before long, I would be heard. 

I could study and explore. What 
small nibblings we have made at 
the sum of available knowledge! 
Suppose I brought in one leaf from 
outdoors, or one common little bug 
— in a few hours of studying it with 
her, I'd know more of my own specialty than a flood of the best textbooks could tell me. 

She has also let me know that 



ANGEL'S EGG 



39 



when she and those who came with 
her have learned a little more about 
humanity, it should be possible to 
improve ray health greatly, and 
probably my life expectancy. I don't 
imagine my back could ever 
straighten, but she thinks the pain 
might be cleared away, entirely 
without drugs. I could have a 
clearer mind, in a body that would 
neither fail nor torment me. 

Then there is the other alternative. 

It seems they have developed a 
technique by means of which any 
unresisting living subject, whose 
brain is capable of memory at all, 
can experience total recall. It is a 
by-product, I understand, of their 
silent speech, and a very recent one. 
They have practiced it foe only a 
few thousand years, and since their 
own understanding of the phenomenon is very incomplete, they 
classify it among their experimental techniques. 

In a general way, it may somewhtf resemble that reliving of the 
past which psychoanalysis can sometimes bring about in a limited way 
for therapeutic purposes. But you 
must imagine that sort of thing tremendously magnified and clarified, 
capable of including every detail 
which has ever registered on the 
subject's brain. 

THE purpose is not therapeutic, 
as we would understand it; 
quite the opposite. The end result 

is — -death. 



Whatever is recalled by this 
process is transmitted to the receiving mind, which can retain it, and 
record any or all of it, if such a 
record is desired; but to the subject 
who recalls, it is a flowing away, 
without return. Thus it is not a 
true "remembering," but a giving. 
The mind is swept clear, naked of 
all its past, and, along with memory, life withdraws also. Very 
quietly. 

At the end, I suppose it must be 
like standing without resistance in 
the engulfmcnt of a flood tide, until finally the waters close over. 

That, it seems, is how Camilla's 
life was "saved." When I finally 
grasped that, I laughed, and the 
angel of course caught the reason. 
I was thinking about my neighbor 
Steele, who boarded Camilla for 
me In his henhouse for a couple of 
winters. 

Somewhere safe in the an.gelic records there must be a hen'seyc image of the patch in the scat 
of Steele's pants. And naturally 
Camilla's view of me too; not too 
unkind, I hope. She couldn't help 
the expression on her rigid little 
face, and I don't believe it ever 
meant anything. 

At the other end of the scale is 
the saved life of my angel's father. 
Recall can be a long process, she 
says, depending on the intricacy and 
richness*of the mind recalling; and 
■in all but the last stages it can be; 
halted at will. Her father's recall 
was begun when they were still far 



40 




 



out in space and he knew that he 
could not long survive the journey. 

When that journey ended, the 
recall had progressed so far' that 
very little actual memory remained 
to him of his life on that other 
planet. He had what must be called 
a deduct ive memory — f rom the. 
material of the years not yet given 
away, he could reconstruct what 
must have been, and I assume the 
other adult who survived the passage must have been able to shelter 
him from errors that loss of memory might involve. This, I infer, 
is why he could not show me a 
two-moon night. 

I forgot to ask her whether the 
images he did send me were from 
actual or deductive memory. Deductive, I think, for there was a 
certain dimness about them not 
present when my angel gives me a 
picture of something seen with her 
own eyes. 

Jade-green eyes, by the way. 
Were you wondering? 

In th e same f ash i on , m y own 
life could be saved. Every aspect of 
existence that I ever touched, that 
ever touched me, could be transmitted to some perfect record — the 
nature of the written record is beyond me, but I have no doubt of 
its relative perfection. Nothing important, good or bad, would be lost. 
And they need a knowledge of humanity, if they are to carry out 
whatever it is they have in mind. 

It would be difficult, she tells me, 
and sometimes painful. Most of the 



effort would be hers, but some of it 
would have to be mine. In her period of infantile education, she 
elected what we should call zoology 
as her life work; for that reason 
she was given intensive theoretical 
training in this technique. Right 
now I guess she knows more than 
anyone else on this planet not only 
about what makes a hen tick, but 
how it feels to be a hen. 

Though a beginner, she is in all 
essentials already an expert. She can 
help me, she thinks, if I choose this 
alternative. At any rate, she could 
ease me over the toughest spots, 
keep my courage from flagging. 

For it seems that this process of 
recall is painful to an advanced intellect — without condescension, she 
calls us very advanced — because, 
while all pretense and self-delusion 
are stripped away, there remains 
conscience, still functioning by 
whatever standards of good and 
bad the individual has developed 
in his lifetime. Our present knowledge of our own motives is such a 
pathetically small beginning! Hardly stronger than an infant's first 
effort to focus his eyes. 

I AM merely wondering how 
much of my life, if I choose 
this way, will seem to me altogether 
hideous. Certainly plenty of the 
"good deeds" which I still cherish 
in memory like so many well-behaved cherubs will turn up with 
the leering aspect of greed or petty 
vanity or worse. 



ANGEL'S EGG 



41 



Not that I am a bad man, in any 
reasonable sense of the term. I respect myself; no occasion to grovel 
and beat my chest. I'm not ashamed 
to stand comparison with any other 
fair sample of the species. But there 
you are: I atn human, and under 
the aspect of eternity so far, plus 
this afternoon's newspaper, that is 
a. rather serious thing. 

Without real knowledge, I think 
of this total recall as something, 
like a passage down a corridor of a 
tilyriad images, now dark, now brilliant, now pleasant, now horrible — 
guided by no certainty except an 
awareness of the open blind door 
at the end of it. It could have its 
pleasing moments and its consolations. I don't see how it could ever 
approximate the delight and satisfaction of living a few more years 
in this world with the angel lighting on my shoulder when she 
wishes, and talking to me. 

I had to ask her how great a 
value such 'a record would be to 
them. Obvious enough — they can 
be of little use to us, by their 
standards, until they understand us, 
and they came here to be of use to 
us as well as to themselves. And 
understanding us, to them, means 
knowing us inside out ■with a completeness such as our most dedicated and laborious scholars could 
never imagine. I remember, about 
those twelve million years: they 
will not touch us until they are 
certain no harm will come of it. 

On our tortured planet, however, 



there is a time factor. They know 
that well enough, of course . . . 

Recall cannot begin unless the 
■subject is willing or unresisting; to 
diem, that has to mean willing, for 
any being with intellect enough to 
make a considered choice. Now, I 
wonder how many they could find 
who would be honestly willing to 
make that uneasy journey into 
death, for no reward except an assurance that they were serving their 
own kind and the angels.
More to the point, I wonder if I 
would be able to achieve such willingness myself, even with her help. 

When this had been explained 
to me, she urged me again to make 
no hasty decision. And she pointed 
out to me what my thoughts were 
already groping at — why not both 
alternatives, within a reasonable 
limit of time? Why couldn't I have 
ten or fifteen years or more with 
her, and then undertake the total 
recall, perhaps not until my physical powers had started toward senility ? I thought that over. 

This morning I had almost decided to choose that most welcome 
and comfortable solution. Then my 
daily paper was delivered. Not that 
I needed any such reminder. 

IN THE afternoon I asked her if 
she knew whether, in the present 
state of human technology, it would 
be possible for our folly to actually 
destroy this planet. She did not 
know, for certain. Three of the 
other children have gone away to 



12 




 



different parts ot the world, to 
learn what they can about that. But 
sfee had to tell me that such a thing 
has happened before, elsewhere in 
the Universe. I guess I won't write 
a letter to the papers advancing an 
explanation for the occasional appearance of a nova among the 
stars. Doubtless others have hit on 
the same hypothesis without the aid 
of angels. 

And that is not all I must consider. 1 could die by accident or 
sudden disease before I had begun 
to give my life. 

Only now, at this very late moil": eat, rubbing my sweaty iorehead 
and gazing into the lights of that 
wonderful ring, have I been able 
to put together some obvious facts 
in the recjiured synthesis. 

I don't know, of course, what 
forms their assistance to us will 
take. I suspect human beings won't 
.see or hear much of the angels for 
a long time to come. Now and 
then disastrous decisions may be 
altered, and those who believe 
thcmsel ves wholly responsible 
won't realize why their minds 
worked that way. Here and there, 
maybe an influential mind will be 
rattier strangely nudged into a better course. Something like that. 
There may be new discoveries and 
inventions of kinds that will tend 
to neutralize the menace of our 
nastiest playthings. 

But whatever -the angels decide 
to do, the record and analysis of my 
fairly typical life will be an aid. Il 



could qven be the small weight deciding the balance between triumph 
and failure. That is Fact One. 

Two: my angel and her brothers 
and sisters, lor all their amazing 
level of advancement, are also of 
perishable protoplasm. Therefore, 
if this ball of mud becomes .1 ball 
of flame, they also will be destroyed. Even if they have the 
means to use their spaceship again 
or to build another, it might easily 
happen that they would not learn 
their danger in time to escape. And 
for all 1 know, this could be tomorrow. Or tonight. 

So there can no longer be any 
doubt as to my choice, anef I will 
tell her when she wakes. 

July 9 

TONIGHT- there is no recaUj 1 
am to rest a while. I see it is 
almost a month since I last wrote- in 
this journal. My total recall began 
three weeks ago, and already the 
first twenty-eight years of my life 
have been savc-d. 

It was a week after I told the 
angel my decision before she was 
prepared to start the recall. During 
that week she searched my present 
mind more closely than I should 
have imagined was possible : she 
had to be sure. 

*At this point Dr. Banncn-nim's handwriting alters curiously. From here on 
he used a soft pencil instead of a pen, 
and the script shct-ws signs of Haste. In 
spite of this, however, it is actually 
much clearer, steadier and easier to read 
than the earlier entries in his normal 
hand. — BLAJXli 



ANGEL'S EGG 



<3 



During that week of hard questions, I dare SAT she learned more 
about my kind than has ever gone 
on record tve-n in a physician's 
office; I hope she did. To any psychiatrist who might question that, I 
offer a naturalists suggestion. It is 
easy to imagine, after some laborious time, that we have noticed 
everything a given patch of ground 
can show us. But alter the vicwpoi n t on ly a 1 i tt 1 e — d ig d own a 
foot with a spade, say, or climb a 
tree-branch and look downward — 
it's a whole new world. 

When the angel was not exploring me in this fashion, she took 
pains to* 'make me glimpse the satisfactions and million rewarding experiences I might have if I those 
the other way. I see how necessary 
that was; at the time it seemed almost cruel. She had to do it, for my 
own sake, and I am glad that I was 
somehow able to stand fast to my 
original choice. So was she, in the 
end; she has even said she loves me 
for it. What that troubling word 
means to her is not within my 
mind. I am satisfied to take it in the 
human sense. 

Since I no longer require normal 
sleep, the recall begins at night, as 
soon as the lights begin to go out 
in the village and there is little 
danger of interruption. Daytimes, I 
putter about in my usual fashion. I 
have sold Steele my hens, and 
Judy's life was saved a week ago. 
That practically winds up my affairs, except that I went to write a 



codicil to my will. I might as well 
do that now, right here in this 
journal, instead of bothering my 
lawyer. It should be legal. 

To Whom It May Concern: 
I hereby bequeath to my friend 
Lester Morse, M.D., of Augusta, Maine, the ring which 
will be found at my death on 
the fifth finger of my left 
hand. I would urge Dr. Morse 
to retain this ring in his private possession at all times, 
and to make provision for its 
disposal, in the event of his 
own death, to some person in 
whose character he places the 
utmost faith.

Tonight she has gone away for a 
while, and I am to rest and do as I 
please till she returns. 1 shall spend 
the time tilling in some blanks in 
this record, but I am afraid it will 
be a spotty job, because there is' so 
much I no longer care about. 

EXCEPT for the lack of desire 
for sleep, and a bodily weariness which is not at all unpleasant, 
I notice no physical effects thus far. 
I have no faintest recollection of 
anything that happened earlier than 
my twenty-eighth birthday. My deductive memory seems rather efficient, and I am sure I could recon

GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



Struct most of the story if it were 
worth the bother. This afternoon I 
grubbed around among some old 
letters of that period, but they 
weren't very interesting. * 

My knowledge of English is unaffected; I can still read scientific 
German and some French, because 
I had occasion to use those languages fairly often after I was 
twenty-eight. The scraps of Latin 
dating from high school are gone. 
So are algebra and all but the simplest proposition of high school 
geometry: I never needed them. 

I CAN remember thinking of my 
mother after twenty-eight, but I 
do not know whether the image this 
provides really resembles her. My 
father died when I was thirty-one, 
so I remember him as a sick old 
man, I believe I had a younger 
brother, but he must have died in 
childhood.* 

Judy's passing was tranquil — 
pleasant for her, I think. It took the 
better part of a day. We went out 
to an abandoned field I know, and 
she lay blinking in the sunshine 
with the angel sitting by her, while 
I dug a grave and then rambled off 
after wild raspberries. Toward evening the angel came and told me I 
could bury Judy — it was finished. 
And most interesting, she said. I 
don't see how there can have been 
anything distressing about it for 

*Dr. Barmen-nan's mother died in 19 IS 
of influenza. His brother (three years 
older, not younger) died of pneumonia, 
1906. — BLAINE 



Judy. After all, what hurts us worst 
is to have our favorite self-deceptions stripped away, and I don't 
think Judy had any. 

1 have not found the recall painful, at least not in retrospect. There 
must have been sharp moments, 
mercifully forgotten along with 
their causes, as if the process had 
gone on under anesthesia. Certainly 
there were plenty of incidents in 
my first twenty-eight years which I 
should not care to offer to the understanding of any but the angels. 
Quite often I must have been mean, 
selfish, base in any number of ways, 
if only to judge by the record since 
twenty-eight. Those old letters 
touch on a few of these things. To 
me, they now matter only as material for a record which is safely out 
of my hands. 

However, to any person I may 
have harmed, I wish to say this: 
you were hurt by aspects of my 
humanity which may not, in a few 
million years, be quite so common 
among us. Against these darker elements I struggled, in my human 
fashion, as you do yourselves. The 
effort is not wasted. 

One evening — I think it was 
June 12 — Lester dropped around 
for sherry and chess. Hadn't seen 
him in quite a while, and haven't 
since. There is a moderate polio 
scare this summer and it keeps him 
on the jump. 

The angel retired behind some 
books on an upper shelf — I'm 
afraid it was dusty — and had fun 



46 




 



with our chess. She had a /air view 
of your bald spot, Lester. Later she 
remarked that she liked your looks, 
but can't you do something about 
that weight ? She suggested an odd 
expedient, which I believe has occurred to your medical self from 
time to time — eating less. 

Maybe she shouldn't have done 
what she did with those chess 
games. Nothing more than my usual 
blundering happened until after my 
first ten moves; by that time 1 suppose she had absorbed the principles, and she took over. I was not 
fully aware of it until I saw you 
looking like a boiled duck. I had 
imagined my astonishing moves 
were the result of my own damn 
cleverness. 

SERIOUSLY, Lester, think back 
to that evening. You've played 
in stiff amateur tournaments; you 
know your own abilities and you 
know mine. Ask yourself whether I 
could have done anything like that 
without help. I tell you again I 
didn't study the game in the interval when you weren't here. I've 
never even had a chess book in the 
library, and if I had, no amount of 
study would take me into your 
class. I haven't that sort of mentality; just your humble sparring partner, and I've enjoyed it on that 
basis, as you might enjoy watching 
a prima donna surgeon pull off 
some miracle you wouldn't dream 
of attempting yourself. Even if 
your game had been away below 



par that evening, and I don't think 
it was, I could never have pinned 
your cars back three times running, 
without help. That evening you 
were a long way out of yonr class, 
that's all. 

I couldn't tell you anything about 
it at the time— she was clear on 
that point — so I could only bumble 
and preen myself and leave you 
mystified. But she wants me to 
write anything I choose in this 
journal, and somehow, Lester, I 
think you may find the next few 
decades pretty interesting. You're 
still young, some ten years younger 
than I. I think you'll see many 
things that I wish I might see come 
to pass — or I would so "wish if I 
were not convinced that my choice 
was the right one. 

Most of those new events will 
not be spectacular, I'd guess. Many 
of the turns to a better way will 
hardly be recognized at the time 
for what they are, by you or anyone 
else. Obviously, our nature being 
what it is, we shall not change 
overnight. To hope for that would 
he as absurd as it is to imagine 
that any formula, ideology, . theory 
of social pattern can bring us into 
Utopia. As I see it, Lester — and I 
think your consulting room would 
have told you the same even if your 
own intuition were not enough — 
there is only one battle of importance: Armageddon. And Armageddon field is within each individual. 

At the moment I believe I am 
the happiest man who ever lived. 



ANGEL'S EGG 



July 20 

ALL but the last ten years are 
now given away. The physical 
fatigue, though still pleasant, is 
quite overwhelming. I am not troubled by the weeds in my garden 
patch — -merely a different sort of 
flowers where I had planned something else. An hour ago she brought 
me the seed of a blown dandelion, 
to show me how lovely it was. I 
don't suppose I had ever noticed. I 
hope whoever Lakes over this place 
wiU bring it back to farming; they 
say the ten acres below the house 
used to be good potato land, nice 
early ground. 

It is delightful to sit in the sun, 
as if I were old. 

After thumbing over earlier entries in this journal, 1 see 1 have 
often felt quite bitter toward my 
own kind. I deduce that I must 
have been a lonely man, with much 
of the loneliness self-imposed. A 
great part of my bitterness must 
have been no more than one ugly 
by-product of a life spent too much 
apart. Some of it doubtless came 
from objective causes, yet I don"t 
believe I ever had more cause than 
any moderately intelligent man who 
would like to see his world a plcasantcr place than it has been. My 
angel tells me that the scar on my 
back is due to an injury received in 
some early stage of the war that 
still goes on. That could have 
soured me, perhaps. It's all right; 
it's in the record. 

She is racing with a humming


bird — holding back, I think, to give 
the Swift little green fluff a break. 

ANOTHER note for you, Lester. 
I have already indicated my 
ring is to be yours. I don't want to 
tell you what 1 have discovertd of 
its properties, for fear.it might not 
give you the same pleasure and interest that it has given me. Of 
course, like any spot of shifting 
light and color, it is an aid to selfhypnosis. It is more, much more 
than that, but — find out for your- ' 
self, at some time when you arc' a 
little protected from everyday distractions. 

I know it can't harm you, because I know its source. 

By the way, I wish you would 
convey to my publishers my request 
that they either discontinue printing 
my Introductory Biology or else 
bring out a new edition revised in 
accordance with some notes you 
will find in the top left drawer of 
my library desk. I glanced through* 
that book after my angel assured 
me that I wrote it, and I was 
amazed. However, I'm afraid my 
notes are messy— I call them mine 
by a poetic license — and they may 
be too advanced for the present 
day, though the revision is mainly 
a matter of leaving out certain generalities that aren't so. Use your 
best judgment. It's a very minor 
textbook, and the thing isn't tooi 
important. 

A last wriggle of my vanishing 
personal vanity.

July 27 

I HAVE seen a two-moon night. 
It was given to me by that remaining grown-up, at the end of a 
wonderful visit, when he and six of 
those nine other children came to 
see me. It was last night, I think — 
yes, must have been. First there was 
a murmur of wings above the 
house; my angel flew in laughing. 
Then they were here, all about me, 
full of gaiety and. colored fire, 
showing off in every way they knew 
would please me. Each one had 
something graceful and friendly to 
say to me. One brought me a moving image of the St. Lawrence seen 
at morning from half a mile up — 
clouds, eagles — now how could he 
know that would delight me so 
much? 

And each one thanked me for 
what I had done. 

But it's been so easy! 

And at <hc end the old one— his 
skin is quite black, and his down 
is white and gray — gave the remembered image of a two-moon 
night. He saw it some sixty years 
ago. 

I have not even considered making an effort to describe it. My fingers will not hold this pencil much 
longer tonight. Oh, soaring buildings of white and amber, untroubled countryside, silver on curling 
rivers, a glimpse of open sea. A 
moon rising in clarity, another setting in a wreath of cloud, between 
them a wide wandering of unfamiliar stars. Here and there the angels. 



worthy after fifty million years to 
live in such night. 

No, I cannot describe anything 
like that. But you human kindred 
of mine, I can do something better. 
I can tell you that this two-moon 
night, glorious as it was, WflS no 
more beautiful than a night under a 
single moon on this ancient and 
familiar Earth might be — if you 
will imagine that human evil has 
been cleared away, and that our 
own people have started at last on 
the greatest of all explorations, 
themselves. 

July 29 

NOTHING now remains to give 
away but the memory of the 
time that has passed since the angel 
came. I am to rest as long as I wish, 
write whatever I want. Then I shall 
get myself over to the bed and lie 
down as if for sleep. She tells me 
that I can keep my eyes open; she 
will dose them for me when I no 
longer see her. 

I remain convinced that our human case is hopeful. 1 feci sure that 
in only a few thousand years we 
may be able to perform some of the 
simpler preparatory tasks, such as 
casting out evil and loving our 
neighbors. And if that should prove 
to be so, who can doubt that in another few million years, or even 
less, wc might be only a little lower 
than the angels?

among his effects after his assassination, and were released to the

STATEMENT BY 
LESTER MORSE, M.D. 
DATED AUGUST 9, 1951 

On the afternoon of July 30, 
1951, acting on what I am obliged 
to describe as an unexpected impulse, I drove out to the country 
for the purpose of calling on my 
friend Dr. David Bannerman. I had 
not seen him nor had word from 
him since the evening of June 12 
of this year, 1951. 

AFTER knocking, calling to him 
and hearing no response, I 
went upstairs to his bedroom and 
found him dead. From superficial 
indications I judged that death 
must have taken place during the 
previous night. He was lying on 
his bed on his left side, comfortably 



50 




 



disposed as if for sleep, but fully 
dressed, with a fresh shirt and 
clean summer slacks. His 'eyes and 
niouih were closed, and there was 
no trace of the disorder to be expected at even the easiest death. 

BECAUSE of these signs I assumed, !»oon as I had determined the absence of breath and 
heartbeat and noted the chill of the 
body, that some neighbor must nave 
already found him, performed these 
simple rites of respect for him, and 
probably notified a local physician 
or other responsible person. I 
therefore waited, Dr. Banncrnian 
had no telephone, expecting that 
someone would soon call. 

Dr. Bannerman's journal was on 
a table near his bed, open to that 
page on which he had written a 
codicil to his will. I read that part. 
Later, while I was waiting for 
others to come, I read the remainder of the journal, as he apparently 
wished me to do. The ring he mentions was on the fifth ringer of his 
left hand, and it is now in my possession. 

When writing that codicil. Dr. 
Bannerman must have overlooked 
or forgotten the fact that in his formal will, written some months 
earlier, he had appointed me executor. If there are legal technicalities 
involved, I shall be pleased to cooperate fully with .the proper authorities. 

The ring, however, will remain 
in my keeping, since that was Dr. 



Bannerman's expressed wish, and I 
am not prepared to offer it for examination or discussion under any 
circumstances. 

The notes for a revision of one 
of his textbooks were in his desk, 
as indicated in the journal. They 
are by no means "messy," nor are 
they particularly revolutionary except in so far as he wished to rephrase, as theory or hypothesis, 
certain statements which I would 
liave regarded as axiomatic. This is 
not my field, and I am not competent to judge. I shall take up the 
matter with his publishers at the 
earliest opportunity.* 

So far as 1 can determine, and 
bearing in mind the results of the 
autopsy performed by Stephen 
Clyde, M.D., the death of Dr. 
David Bannerman was not incon 
sistcnt with the presence of an embolism of some type not distinguishable on post mortem. I have so 
stated on the certificate of death. 1 
am compelled to add one other 
item of medical opinion for what 
it may be worth: 

I am not a psychiatrist, but, owing to the demands of general practise, I have found it advisable to 
keep as up to date as possible with 
current findings and opinion in 
this branch of medicine. Dr. Bannerman possessed, in my opinion, 
emotional and intellectual stability 

^LIBRARIAN'S^ NOTE: But it seems 
lie never did. No new edition of "Introductory Biology" was ever brought 
out, and the textbook has been out of 
print since 1952.

to a higher degree than anyone else 
of comparable intelligence in the 
entire field of iny acquaintance, personal and professional. 

IF IT is suggested that he was 
suffering from a hallucinatory 
psychosis, I can only say that it 
must have been of a type quite outside my experience and not described, so far as I know, anywhere 
in tlie literature of psych op athol
Dr. Banncrman's house, on the 
afternoon of July 30, was in good 
order. Near the open, unscreened 
window of his bedroom there was 
a coverless shoebox with a folded 
silk scarf in the bottom. I found no 
pillow such as Dr. Banncrman describes in the journal, but observed 



that a small section had been cut 
from the scarf. In this box, and 
near it, there was a peculiar fragrance, faint, aromatic, very sweet, . 
such as I have never encountered 
before and therefore cannot describe. 

It may or may not have any bearing on the case that, while I re-' 
mained in his house that afternoon, 
I felt no sense of grief or personal 
loss, although Dr. Bannerman had 
been a loved and honored friend 
for a number of years. I merely 
had, and have, a conviction that 
after the completion of some \uy 
great undertaking, he had found 
peace. 

The ring he bequeathed to me 
has confirmed that.
