OUT OF THIS WORLD 

Men of Other Planets 

by Kenneth Heuer 

Suppose you went rocketing off into space 
tomorrow ... This is the exciting, scientifically accurate panorama of what you would 
probably find out there: the moon, with its 
gray landscape in a completely soundless land 
...Mercury, with stars shining even in the 
daytime... sunless Uranus, immense Jupiter, 
speeding comets. Here is a startling account 
of an unexplored world — eagerly awaiting 
the daring, the adventurer, the dreamer.

Looking Forward 



MOST of our letters aie 
complimentary, some extravagantly so, but one 
by Harold W. Cheney, Jr., of Little 
Falls, N. Y., had the unexpected 
effect of reviving an emotion I 
haven't felt in almost 20 years of 
professional writing and editing. 
His long letter ends: 

"I think there are two main reasons for the maj ority of readers 
being so favorably* inclined toward 
editorials, a negative and a positive 
one. The negative one is that in 
magazines without a regular editor's 
page, things just happen. Nothing 
is explained except in barest pronouncements or the action itself. 
The reader feels that there is a 
barrier between the editor and him, 
so that the editor, his policy, and 
thence his magatihe remain abstract unknowns. The reader likes 
to have some anticipation of what 
is to happen, and not to have things 
dished out without an explanation. 

"The positive reason is more important. Remember, Mr. Gold, you 
are doing something that uncounted 
readers and fans may only dream of 
doing. You are editing a great 
science fiction magazine * * * We 
ask you to share with -us, via your 
editorials, your wonderful experiences in creating the finest * * *" 
The rest gets blush- provoking. 
Somewhat smothered under considerably more than 5,000,000 



words of stories, articles and scripts, 
and well over two dozen magazines, 
Mr. Cheney, is the dazzled boy who 
discovered science fiction in 1927, 
at the age of 13- Your tetter has 
dug him out, for which you merit 
something like a rescue badge. 

Amazing stories had been out for 
a year then, but it was Wells' War 
of ihe Worlds, sitting innocently on 
a Providence library shelf, that I 
found first. The personal Impact 
was that of an explosive harpoon, 
and when I belatedly discovered 
those beautifully garish Paul covers, 
decorated with heroically paralyzed 
men in jodhpurs ?nd simperingly 
paralyzed women in blowy veils, 
among giant insects and plants with 
leering heads, I was hooked. 

That was a pretty skinny time 
for science fiction lovers. Quarters 
were big money for kids then, and 
the libraries had so few titles that 
each had to be read again and again. 

What it did, though, was make 
me realize exactly what I wanted 
for a career. It's still what \ want, 
though anesthetized by the daily 
routine of reading and sending back 
duels on asteroids, alien caters of 
life force in the Andes, which 
somehow select only lovely rirgins, 
thinking machines that go insane 
when asked to solve the problem of 
man's survival, mutant babies that 
have to be destroyed because they 
have only ten fingers . . .

No day's mail is free of these 
flakes of literary dandruff, but then, 
unexpectedly, an Angel's Egg 
comes in and you suddenly find 
ypurself living a story instead of 
glazed ly following the alleged adventures of dull lushes, humorless 
wisecrackcrss, hard-lipped Space 
Patrolmen, nymphomaniacal heroines who are snowy pure . , . 

'I don't know what the reaction 
will be to Angel's Egg, of course. 
It had the feel of a find, though, 
which is a wonderful experience. 

Unfortunately, the dream of editing as good a magazine as possible 
does not include production difficulties. Because buying paper these 
days is like being mugged on a 
dark street, GALAXY has been late 
much too often. The problem is 
being solved and we should have no 
trouble reaching the newsstands on 
time, but it's been a headache. 

Other headaches are distribution, 
newsStand display, rocketing costs, 
ruckuscs over ads, sweating good 
stories into better stories, and improving art, which has been the 
biggest single gripe of readers. We 
could have avoided the battle over 
art by either eliminating it, a bad 
practice for circulation, or hunching down to the general science 
fiction level, a cowardly evasion 
since most of it is so damned unsightly. We're getting there with 
new techniques, all of which take 
work, anguish, worry. 

Not enough, however, to spoil 
the pleasure of presenting Mars 



Child and the dazzling satire of 
Don't Live in the Past. 

Matter of fact, looking forward 
to the issues coming up is a .Tiffany-set, platinum-cased thrill. 

Next month you'll find Venus Is 
a Man's World by William Tcnn 
married to Appointment in Tomorrow by Fritz Leiber, and they make 
a handsome couple of novelets, as 
well as the startling conclusion of 
Mars Child. 

Then, in the GALAXY Novels 
series, there will be The Alien by 
Raymon d F. Jon cs, and , two 
months later, Empire by Clifford D. 
Simak, neither of which has ever 
appeared anywhere in print. 

When Mars Child ends, there 
will be an issue of complete stories, 
led off by Beyond Bedlam, a novella 
by Wyman Guin, combining a new 
name with a new and brilliant concept in science fiction. 

And then, the following month 
— well, maybe you've heard rumors 
that GALAXY has a Robert A. 
Heinlein novel. For once the rumors are true. The name is The 
Puppet Masters; look forward to 
three installments of superb suspense ! 

You're right, Mr. Cheney, editing GALAXY is a wonderful experience and I don't want to keep it 
all to myself. I'll share every bit of 
it, in fact, with readers who have 
specific questions. 

What would you like to know 
and never had the chance to ask?

ADVENTURES 
IN 

TOMORROW 

A Galaxy of Science-Fiction Stories 

edited by Kendell Foster Crossen 

C Here is a look into tomorrow, the story 
of the future as imagined by fifteen leading 
writers of science-fiction and fantasy. The 
guesses range from the complete destruction 
of the world to a great civilization in which 
men board a space ship for Betelgeuse as 
casually as today they climb on the metropolitan bus. Here you will find: 

C. THE ATOMIC AGE — covering the years between A.D. i960 and 2100. 
Four exciting versions of what will happen if the Earth becomes involved 
in an atomic war, by Walter Van Tilburg Clark, Ward Moore, Ray Bradbury, and Forrest Ackerman. 

C. THE GALACTIC AGE— from A.D. 2100 to 3000. Of the days when 
men have left the earth and gone to the planets — high adventure in space, 
on Venus, on Ganymede, by A. E. van Vogt, Kendell Foster Crossen, C. I Moore, and Isaac Asimov. 

C THE STELLAR AGE— the years between A.D. 3000 and 10,000. Man 
has always looked beyond his attainments— beyond the oceans, beyond 
the atmosphere, beyond the Moon, beyond the planets — and here Theodore 
Sturgeon, Sam Merwin, Jr., Leigh Bracket t and Henry Kuttner sec man 
setting foot upon the farthest stars. 

C. THE DELPHIC AGE — one million years into the future. Robert 
Arthur. Anthony Boucher, and Bruce Elliott take a look at Man, once 
more on Earth, after he has spanned the Galaxies and grown old and 
weary with what he has seen. 

C. Now there is no need to wait for the future — ADVENTURES IN TOMORROW will bring it to yon today.

HUNT 

the 
HUNTER 

BY KRIS NEVILLE 



Of course using live bait is the best way to lure dangerous 
alien animals . . . unless it turns out that you are the bait! 




Illustrated by ELIZABETH MaclNTYRE 




"W 



E'RE somewhat to the 
south, I think," Ri 
said, bending over 
the crude field map. "That ridge," 
he pointed, "on our left, is right 
here." He drew a finger down the 
map. "It was over here," he moved 
the finger, "over the ridge, north 
of here, that we sighted them." 
Extrone asked, "Is there a pass?" 
Ri looked up, studying the terrain. He moved his shoulders, 
don't know, but maybe they 
this far. Maybe they're on this s 
of the ridge, too." 

Delicately, Estrone raised a 
hand to his beard. "I'd hate to lose 
a day crossing the ridge," he said. 

"Yes, sir," Ri said. Suddenly he 
threw back his head. "Listen 
"Eh?" Extrone said. 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



"Hear it? That cough? I think 
that's one, from over there. Right 
up ahead of us." 

Extrone raised his eyebrows. 

This time, the coughing roar 
was more distant but distinct. 

"It is !" Ri said. "It's a farn 
beast, all right!" 

Extrone smiled, almost pointed 
teeth showing through the beard. 
"I'm glad we won't have to cross 
the ridge." 

Ri wiped his forehead on the 
back of his sleeve. "Yes, sir." 

"We'll pitch camp right here, 
then," Extrone said. "We'll go 
after it tomorrow." He looked at 
the sky. "Have the bearers hurry." 

"Yes, sir." 

Ri moved away, his pulse gradually slowing. "You, there !" he 
called. "Pitch camp, here!" 

He crossed to Mia, who, along 
with him, had been pressed into 
Extrone's party as guides. Once 
more, Ri addressed the bearers, "Be 
quick, now!" And to Mia, "God 
almighty, he was getting mad." He 
ran a hand under his collar. "It's 
a good thing that farn beast sounded off when it did. I'd .hate to think 
of making him climb that ridge." 

Mia glanced nervously over his 
shoulder. "It's that damned pilot's 
fault for setting us down on this 
side. I told him it was the other side. 
I told him so." 

Ri shrugged hopelessly. 

Mia said, "I don't think he even 
saw a blast area over here. I think 
he wanted to get us in trouble." 



"There shouldn't be one. There 
shouldn't be a blast area on this 
side of the ridge, too." 

"That's what I mean. The pilot 
don't like businessmen. He had it 
in for us.'* 

Ri cleared his throat nervously. 
"Maybe you're right." 

"It's the Hunting Club he don't 
like." 

"I wish to God I'd never heard 
of a farn beast," Ri said. "At least, 
then, I wouldn't be one of his 
guides. Why didn't he hire somebody else?" 

MIA looked at his companion. 
He spat. "What hurts most, 
he pays us for it. I could buy half 
this planet, and he makes me his 
guide — at less than I pay my secretary." 

"Well, anyway, we won't have 
to cross that ridge." 

"Hey, you!" Extrone called. 

The two of them turned immediately. 

"You two scout ahead," Extrone 
said. "See if you can pick up some 
tracks." 

"Yes, sir," Ri said, and instantly 
the two of them readjusted their 
shoulder straps and started off. 

Shortly they were inside of the 
scrub forest, safe from sight. "Let's 
wait here," Mia said. 

"No, we better go on. He may 
have sent a spy in." 

They pushed on, being careful 
to blaze the trees, because they 
were not professional guides.

"We don't want to get too near," 
Ri said after toiling through the 
forest for many minutes. "Without 
guns, we don't want to get near 
enough for Ihe fam beast to charge 
us." 

They stopped. The forest was 
dense, the vines clinging. 

"He'll want the bearers to hack 
a path for him," Mia said. "But 
we go it alone. Damn him." 

Ri twisted his mouth into a sour 
frown. He wiped at his forehead. 
"Hot. By God, it's hot. I didn't 
think it was this hot, the first time 
we were here." 

Mia said, "The first time, we 
weren't guides. Wc didn't notice it 
so much then." 

They fought a few yards more 
into the forest. 

Then it ended. Or, rather, there 
was a wide gap. Before them lay a 
blast area, unmistakable. The grass 
was beginning to grow again, but 
the tree stumps were roasted from 
the rocket breath. 

"This isn't ours!" Ri said. "This 
looks like it was made nearly a 
year ago!" 

Mia's eyes narrowed. "The military from Xnile?" 

"No," Ri said. "They don't have 
any rockets this small. And I don't 
think there's another cargo rocket 
on this planet outside of the one 
we leased from the Club. Except 
the one be brought." 

"The ones who discovered the 
farn beasts in the first place?" Mia 
asked. "You think it's their blast?" 



"So?" Ri said. "But who are 
they ?" 

TT WAS Mia's turn to shrug. 
.1 "Whoever they were, they 
couldn't have been hunters. They'd 
have kept the secret better." 

"We didn't do so damned well." 

"We didn't have a chance," Mia 
objected. "Everybody and his 
brother had heard the run i OX that 
farn beasts were somewhere around 
here. It wasn't our fault Extrone 
found out." 

"1 wish wc hadn't shot our 
guide, then. I wish he was here 
instead of us." 

Mia shook perspiration out of 
his eyes, "Wc should have shot our 
pilot, too. That was our mistake. 
The pilot must have been the one 
who told Extrone we'd hunted this 
area." 

"I didn't think a Club pilot 
would do that." 

"After Extrone said he'd hunt 
farn beasts, even if it meant going 
to the alien system? Listen, you 
don't know . . . Wait a minute." 

ffhere was perspiration on Ri's 
upper lip. 

r 7 didn't tell Extrone, if that's 
what you're thinking," Mia said. 

Ri's mouth twisted. "I didn't 
say you did." 

"Listen," Mia said in a hoarse 
whisper. "I just thought. Listen. To 
hell with how he found out. Here's 
the point. Maybe he'll shoot us, 
too, when the hunt's over." 

Ri licked his lips. "No. He 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



wouldn't do that. We're not — not 
just anybody. He couldn't kill us 
like that. Not even him. And besides, why would he want to do 
that? It wouldn't do any good to 
shoot us. Too many people already 
know about the tarn beasts. You 
said that yourself." 

Mia said, "I hope you're right." 
They stood side by side, studying 
the blast area in silence. Finally, 
Mia said, "We better be getting 
back." 

"What'll we tell him?" 

"That we saw tracks. What else 
can we tell him?" 

They turned back along their 
trail, stumbling over vines. 

"It gets hotter at sunset," Ri said 
nervously. 

"The breeze dies down." 

"It's screwy. I didn't think farn 
beasts had this wide a range. There 
must be a lot of them, to be on 
both sides of the ridge like this." 

"There may be a pass," Mia said, 
pushing a vine away. 

Ri wrinkled his brow, panting. 
"I guess that's it. If there were a 
lot of them, we'd have heard something before we did. But even so, 
it's damned funny, when you think 
about it." 

Mia looked up at the darkening 
sky. "We better hurry," he said. 

WHEN it came over the hastily 
established camp, the rocket 
was low, obviously looking for a 
landing site. It was a military craft, 
from the outpost on the near moon, 



and forward, near the nose, there 
was the blazoned emblem of the 
Ninth Fleet. The rocket roared directly over Extrone's tent, turned 
slowly, spouting fuel expensively, 
and settled into the scrub forest, 
turning the vegetation beneath it 
sere by its blasts. 

Extrone sat on an upholstered 
stool before his tent and spat disgustedly and combed his beard 
with his blunt fingers. 

Shortly, from the direction of 
the rocket, a group of four highranking officers came out of the 
i or est, heading toward him. They 
were spruce, the officers, with military discipline holding their waists 
in and knees almost stiff. 

"What in hell do you want ?" 
Extrone asked. 

They stopped a respectful distance away. "Sir . . ." one began. 

"Haven't I told you gentlemen 
that rockets frighten the game ?" 
Extrone demanded, ominously not 
raising his voice. 

"Sir," the lead officer said, "it's 
another alien ship. It was sighted 
a few hours ago, off this very 
planet, sir." 

Extrone's face looked much too 
innocent. "How did it get there, 
gentlemen ? Why wasn't it destroyed ?" 

"We lost it again, sir. Temporarily, sir." 

"So?" Extrone mocked. 

"We thought you ought to return to a safer planet, sir. Until we 
could locate and destroy it." 



8 




 



Extrone stared at them for a. 
space. Then, indifferently, he 
turned away, in the direction of a 
resting bearer. "You!" he said. 
'"Hey! Bring me a drink !" He faced 
the officers again. He smiled maliciously. "I'm staying here." 

The lead officer licked his firm 
lower lip. "But, sir . . ." 

Extrone toyed with his beard. 
"About a year ago, gentlemen, 
there was an alien ship around here 
then, wasn't there? And you destroyed it, didn't you?" 

"Yes, sir. When we located it, 
sir." 

"You'll destroy this one, too," 
Extrone said. 

"We have a tight patrol, sir. It 
can't slip through. But it might try 
a long range bombardment, sir." 

EXTRONE said, "To begin with, 
they probably don't even know 
I'm here. And they probably couldn't hk this area if they did know. 
And you can't afford to let them 
get a shot at me, anyway." 

"That's why we'd like you to 
return to an inner planet, sir." 

Extrone plucked at his right ear 
lobe, half closing his eyes. "You'll 
lose a fleet before you'll dare let 
anything happen to me, gentlemen. 
I'm quite safe here, I think." 

The bearer brought Extrone his 
drink. 

"Get off," Extrone said quietly 
to the four officers. 

Again they turned reluctantly. 
This time, he did not call them 



back. Instead, with amusement, he 
watched until they disappeared into 
the tangle of forest. 

Dusk was falling. . The -takeoff 
blast of the rocket illuminated the 
area, casting weird shadows on the 
gently swaying grasses; there was 
a hot breath of dry air and the 
rocket dwindled toward the stars. 

Extrone stood up lazily, stretching. He tossed th e empty glas s 
away, listened for it to shatter. He 
reached out, parted the heavy flap 
to his tent. 

"Sir?" Ri said, hurrying toward 
him in the gathering darkness. 

"Eh?" Extrone said, turning, 
startled. "Oh, you. Well?" 

"We . . . located signs of the 
farn beast, sir. To the east." 

Extrone nodded. After a moment he said, "You killed one, I 
believe, on your trip?" 

Ri shifted. "Yes, sir." 

Extrone held back the flap of the 
tent. "Won't you come in?" he 
asked without any politeness whatever. 

Ri obeyed the order. 

The inside of the tent was luxurious. The bed was of bulky 
feathers, costly of transport space, 
the sleep curtains of silken gauze. 
The floor, heavy, portable tile 
blocks, not the hollow kind, were 
neatly and smoothly inset into the 
ground. Hanging from the center, 
to the left of the slender, handcarved center pole, was a chain of 
crystals. They tinkled lightly when 
Extrone dropped the flap. The light 



HUNT THE HUNTER

was electric from a portable 
dynamo. Extrone flipped it on. He 
crossed to the bed, sat down. 

"You were, I believe, the first 
ever to kill a farn beast?" he said. 

"I . . . No, sir. There must have 
been previous hunters, sir." 

EXTRONE narrowed his eyes. 
"I see by your eyes that you 
arc envious — thai is 'the word, isn't 
it? — of my tent." 

Ri looked away from his face. 
"Perhaps I'm envious of your 
reputation as a hunter. You see, I 
have never killed a farn beast. In 
fact, I haven't seen a farn beast." 

Ri glanced nervously around the 
tent, his sharp eyes avoiding Extronc's glittering ones. "Few people have seen them, sir." 

"Oh?" Extrone questioned mildly. "I wouldn't say that. I understand that; the aliens hunt them ' 
quite extensively ... on some of 
their planets-" 

"I meant in our system, sir." 
"Of course you did," Extrone 
said, lazily tracing the crease of his 
sleeve with his forefinger. "I imagine these are the only farn beasts in 
our system." 

Ri waited uneasily, not aitswer
"Yes," Extrone said, ".I imagine 
they arc. It would have been a 
shame if you had killed the last 
one. Don't you think so?" 

Ri's hands worried the sides of 
Iiis outer garment. "Yes, sir. It 
would have been.'* 



Extrone pursed his lips. "It 
wouldn't have been very considerate of you tci — But, still, you 
gained valuable experience. I'm 
glad you agreed to come along as* 
my guide." 

"It was an honor, sir." 

Extrone's lip twisted in wry 
amusement. "If I had waited until 
it was safe for me to hunt on an 
alien planet, 1 would not have been 
able to find- such an illustrious 
guide." 

". . . I'm flattered, sir." 

"Of course," Extrone said. "But 
you should have spoken to me 
about it, when you discovered the 
farn beast in our own system." 

"I realize that, sir. That is, I 
had intended at the first opportunity, sir . . ." 

"Of course," Extrone said dryly. 
"Like all of my subjects," he waved 
his hand in a broad gesture, "the 
highest as well as the lowest slave, 
know' me and love me. I know 
your intentions were the best." 

Ri squirmed, his face pale. "We 
do indeed love you, sir." 

Extrone bent forward. "Know 
me and love me." 

"Yes, sir. Know you and love 
you, sir,"-Ri said. 

"Get out!" Extrone said. 

"TT'S frightening," Ri said, "to 
X be that close to him." 
Mia nodded. 

The two of them, beneath the 
leaf -swollen branches of the gnarled 
tree, were seated on their sleeping

bags. The moon was clear and cold 
and bright in a cloudless sky; a 
small moon, smooth-surfaced, except for a central mountain ridge 
that bisected it into almost twin 
hemispheres. 

"To think of him. As flesh and 
blood. Not like the— well; that — 
what we've read about." 

Mia. glanced suspiciously around 
him at the shadows. "You begin 
to understand a lot of things, after 
seeing him." 

Ri picked nervously at the cover 
of his sleeping bag. 

"It makes you think," Mia 
added. He twitched. "I'm afraid. 
I'm afraid he'll . . . Listen, we'll 
talk. When 'we get back to civilization. You, me, the bearers. About 
him. He can't let that happen. He'll 
kill us first." 

Ri looked up at the moon, shivering. "No. We have friends. We 
have influence. He couldn't just like 
that — " 

"He could say it was an accident." 

"No," Ri said stubbornly. 

"He can say anything," Mia 
insisted. "He can make people believe anything, Whatever he says. 
There's no "way to check on it." 

"It's getting cold," Ri said. 

"Listen," Mia pleaded. 

"No," Ri said. "Even if we tried 
to tell them, they wouldn't listen. 
Everybody would know we were 
lying. Everything they've come to 
believe would tell them we were 
lying. Everything they've read, 



every picture they've seen. They 
wouldn't believe us. He knows 
that." 

"Listen," Mia repeated intently. 
"This is important.. Right now he 
couldn't afford to let us talk. Not 
right now. Because the Army is not 
agairftt him. Some officers were 
here, just before we came back. A 
bearer overheard them talking. They 
don't want to overthrow him!" 

Ri's teeth, suddenly, were chattering. 

"That's another lie," Mia continued, "That he protects the people from the Army. That's a lie. I 
don't believe they were ever plotting against him. Not even at first. 
I think they helped him, don't you 
see?" 

Ri whined nervously. 

"It's like this," Mia said. "I see 
it like this. Hie Army put him in 
power when the people were in 
rebellion against military rule." 

RI swallowed. "We couldn't 
make the people believe that." 
"No?" Mia challenged. "Couldn't we? Not today, but what about 
tomorrow ? You'll see. Because I 
think the Army is getting ready to 
invade the alien system!" 

"The people won't support 
them," Ri answered woodenly. 

"Think. If he tells them to, they 
will. They trust him." 

Ri looked around at the shadows. 
"That explains a lot of things," 
Mia said. "I think the Army's been 
preparing for this for a long time. 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



11 



From the first, maybe. That's why 
Extrone cut off our trade with the 
aliens. Partly to keep them from 
learning that he was getting ready 
to invade them, but more to keep 
them from exposing him to the 
people. The aliens wouldn't be 
fooled like we were, so easy»' 

"No!" Ri snapped. "It was to 
keep the natural economic balance." 

"You know that's not right," 

Ri lay down on his bed roll. 
"Don't talk about it. It's not good 
to talk like this. I don't even want 
to listen." 

"When the invasion starts, he'll 
hive to command all their loyalties. To keep them from revolt 
again. They'd be ready to believe 
us, then. He'll have a hard enough 
time without people running around 
trying to tell the truth." 

"You're wrong. He's not like 
that. I know you're wrong." 

Mia smiled twistedly. "How 
many -has he already killed? How 
can we even guess?" 

Ri swallowed sickly. 

"Remember our guide? To keep 
our hunting territory a secret?" 

Ri shuddered. "That's different. 
Don't you see? This is not at all 
like that." 

WTH morning came birds' 
songs, came dew, came 
breakfast smells. The air was sweet 
with cooking' and it was nostalgic, 
childhoodlike, uncontaminated. 

And Extrone stepped out of the 
tent, fully dressed, surly, letting 



the flap slap loudly behind him. He 
stretched hungrily and stared 
around the camp, his eyes still vacant-mean with' sleep. 

"Breakfast!" he shouted, and 
two bearers came running with a 
folding table and chair. Behind 
them, a third bearer, carrying a tray 
of various foods; and yet behind 
him, a fourth, with a steaming 
pitcher and a drinking mug. 

Extrone ate hugely, with none of 
the delicacy sometimes affected in 
his conversational gestures. When 
he had finished, he washed his 
mouth with water and spat on the 
ground. 

"Lin!" he said. 

His personal bearer came loping 
toward him. 

"Have you read that manual I 
gave you ?" 

Lin nodded. "Yes." 

Txtrone pushed the table away. 
He smacked his lips wetly. "Very 
ludicrous, Lin. Have you noticed 
that I have two businessmen for 
guides? It occurred to me When' I 
got up. They would have spat on 
me, twenty years ago, damn them." 

Lin waited. 

"Now I can spit on them, which 
pleases me." 

"The farn beasts are dangerous, 
sir," Lin said. 

"Eh? Oh, yes. Those. What did 
the manual say about them?" 

"I believe they're carnivorous, 
sir." 

"An alien manual. That's ludicrous, too. That we have the only 



12 




 



information on our newly discovered fauna from an alien manual- — 
and, of course, two businessmen." 

"They have very long, sharp 
fangs, and, when enraged, are capable of tearing a man — " 

"An alien?" Extronc corrected. 

"There's not enough difference 
between us to matter, sir. Of tearing an alien to pieces, sir." 

Extrone laughed harshly. "It's 
'sir' -whenever you contradict me?" 

Lin's face remained impassive. 
"I guess it seems that way. Sir." 

"Damned few people would dare 
go as far as you do," Extronc said. 
"But you're afraid of me, too, in 
your own way, aren't you?" 

Lin shrugged. "Maybe." 

"I can see you are. Even my 
wives are. I wonder if anyone can 
know how wonderful it feels to 
have people all afraid of you." 

"The farn beasts, according to 
the manual . . , 

"You are very insistent on one 
subject." 

". . . It's the only thing I know 
anything about. The farn beast, as 
I was saying, sir, is the particular 
enemy of men. Or if you like, of 
aliens. Sir." 

"All right," Extronc said, 
annoyed. "I'll be careful." 

In the distance, a farn beast 
coughed. 

Instantly alert, Extronc said, "Get 
the bearers ! Have some of them 
cut a path through that damn 
thicket! And tell those two businessmen to get the hell over here!" 



Lin smiled, his eyes suddenly 
afire with the excitement of the 
hunt. 

FOUR hours later, they were 
well into the scrub forest. Extrone walked leisurely, well back 
of the cutters, who hacked away, 
methodically, at the vines and 
branches which might impede his 
forward progress. Their sharp, 
awkward knives snickered rhythmically to the rasp of their heavy 
breathing. 

Occasionally, Extrone halted, motioned for his water carrier, and 
drank deeply of the icy water to 
allay the heat of the forest, a heat 
made oppressive by the press of 
foliage against the outside air. 

Ranging out, on both sides of 
the central body, the two businessmen fought independently against 
the wild growth, each scouting the 
flanks for farn beasts, and ahead, 
beyond the cutters, Lin flittered 
among the tree trunks, sometimes 
far, sometimes near. 

Extrone carried the only weapon, 
slung easily over his shoulder, a 
powerful blast rifle, capable of 
piercing medium armor in sustained 
fire. To his rear, the water carrier 
was trailed by a man bearing a 
folding stool, and behind him, a 
man carrying the heavy, high-powered two-way communication set. 

Once Extronc- unslung his blast 
rifle and triggered a burst at a tiny, 
arboreal mammal, which, upon the 
impact, shattered asunder, to Ex

trone's- satisfied chuckle, in a burst 
of blood and fur. 

When the sun stood high and 
heat exhaustion made the nearnaked bearers slump, Estrone permitted a rest. While waiting for 
the march to resume, he sat on the 
stool with his back against an ancient tree and patted, reflectively, 
the blast rifle, lying across his legs. 

"For you, sir," 'the communications man said, interrupting his 
reverie. 

"Damn," Extrone muttered. His 
face twisted in anger. "It better be 
important." He took the head-set 
and mike and nodded to the bearer. 
The bearer twiddled the dials. 

"Extrone. Eh? . . . Oh, you got 
their ship. Well, why in hell bother 
me? . . . All right, so they found 
out I was here. You got them, 
didn't you?" 

Blasted them right out of 
space," the voice crackled excitedly. "Right in the middle of a radio 
broadcast, sir.'' 

"I don't want to listen to your 
gabbling when I'm hunting!" Extrone tore off the head-set and 
handed it to the bearer. "If they 
call back, find out what they want, 
first. I don't want to be bothered 
unless it's important." 

"Yes, sir." 
' Extrone squinted up at the sun; 
his eyes crinkled under the glare, 
and perspiration stood in little 
droplets on the back of his hands. 

Lin, returning to the column, 
threaded his way among reclining 



bearers. He stopped before Extrone 
and tossed his hair out of his eyes. 
"I located a spoor," he said, suppressed eagerness in his voice. 
"About a quarter ahead. It looks 
fresh." 

Extrone's eyes lit with passion. 

Lin's face was red with heat fetid 
grimy with sweat. "There were 
two, I think." 

"Two?" Extrone grinned, petting the rifle. "You and I better 
go forward and look at the spoor." 

Lin said, "We ought to take 
protection, if you're going, too." 

Extrone laughed. "This is 
enough/' He gestured with the rifle 
and stood up. 

"T wish you had let me bring a 
gun along, sir," Lin said. 

"One is enough in my camp." 

THE two of them went forward, 
alone, into the forest. Extrone 
moved agilely through the tangle, 
following Lin closely. When they 
came to the tracks, heavily pressed 
into drying mud around a small 
watering hole, Extrone nodded his 
head in satisfaction. 

"This way," Lin said, pointing, 
and once more the two of them 
Started off. 

They went a good distance 
through the forest, Extrone becoming more alert with each additional 
foot. Finally, Lin stopped him with 
a restraining hand. "They may be 
quite a way ahead. Hadn't we ought 
to bring up the column?" 

The farn beast, somewhere be


14 




 



yond a ragged clump of bushes, 
coughed. Extrone clenched the blast 
rifle convulsively. 

The farn beast coughed again, 
more distant this time. 

"They're moving away," Lin said, 

"Damn!" Extrone said. 

"It's a good thing the wind's 
right, or 'they'd be coming back, 
and fast, too." 

"Eh?" Extrone said. 

"They charge on scent, sight, or 
sound. I understand they will track 
down a man for as long as a day." 

"Wait," Extrone said, combing 
his beard. "Wait a minute." 

"Yes?" 

"Look," Extrone said. "If that's 
the case, why do we bother tracking them? Why not make them 
come to us?" 

"They're too unpredictable. It 
wouldn't be safe. I'd rather have 
surprise on our side." 

"You don't seem to see what I 
mean," Extrone said. "We won't 
be the — ah — the bait." 

"Oh?" 

"Let's get back to the column.'* 

"T71XTRONE wants to see you," 
-Li Lin said. 

Ri twisted at the grass shoot, 
broke it off, worried and unhappy. 
"What's he want to see me for?" 

"I don't know," Lin said curtly. 

Ri got to his feet. One of his 
hands reached out, plucked nervously at Lin's bare forearm. "Look," 
he whispered. "You know him. I 
have — a little .money. If you were 



able to . . . if he wants," Ri 
gulped, "to do anything to me — 
I'd pay you, if you could . . ." 

"You better come along," Lin 
said, turning. 

Ri rubbed his hands along his 
thighs; he sighed, a tiny sound, 
ineffectual. He followed Lin beyond an outcropping of shale to 
where Extrone was seated, petting 
his rifle. 

Extrone nodded genially. "The 
farn beast hunter, eh?" 
"Yes, sir." 

Extrone drummed his fingers on 
the stock of the blast rifle. "Tell me 
what they look like," he said suddenly. 

"Well, sir, they're . . . uh . . ." 
"Pretty frightening?" 
"No, sir . . . Well, in a way, 
sir." 

"But you weren't afraid ot them, 
were you?" 

"No, sir. No, because . . ." 

Extrone was smiling innocently. 
"Good. 1 want you. to do something for me." 

. "I ... I ..." Ri glanced nervously at Lin out of the tail of his 
eye. Lin's face was impassive. 

"Of course you will," Extrone 
said genially. "Get me a rope, Lin. 
A good, long, strong rope." 

"What are you going to do?" 
Ri asked, terrified. 

"Why, I'm going to tie the rope 
around your waist and stake you 
out as bait." 

"No!" 

"Oh, come now. When the farn 



HUNT THE HUNTER 



beast hears you scream — you am 
scream, by the way?"' 
Ri swallowed. 

"We could find a. way to make 
you." 

There was perspiration trickling 
down Ri's forehead, a single drop, 
creeping toward his nose. 

"You'll be safe," Extrone said, 
studying his face with amusement. 
"I'll shoot the an i mal before it 
reaches you." 

Ri gulped for air. "But ... it 
there should be more than one?" 

Extrone shrugged. 

"I — Look, sir. Listen to me." 
Ri's lips were bloodless and his 
hands were trembling. "It's not me 
you want to do this to. It's Mia, 
sir. He killed a farn beast before / 
did, sir. And last night — last night, 
he—" 

"He what?" Extrone demanded, 
leaning forward intently. 

Ri breathed with a gurgling 
sound. "He said he ought to kill 
you, sir. That's what he said. I 
heard him, sir. He said he ought 
to kill you. He's the one you ought 
to use for bait. Then if there was 
an accident, sir, it wouldn't matter, 
because he said he ought to kill 
you. I wouldn't . . ." 

Extrone said, "Which one- is 
he?" 

"That one. Right over there." 

"The one with his back to me?" 

"Yes, sir. That's him. That's 
him, sir." 

Extrone aimed carefully and 
fired, full charge, then lowered the 



rifle and said, "Here comes Lin 
with the rope, I see." 

Ri was greenish. "You . . . 
you . . ." 

Extrone turned to Lin. "Tic one 
end around his waist." 

"Wait," Ri begged, fighting off 
the rope with his hands. "You 
don't want to use me, sir. Not after 
I told you . . . Please, sir. If anything should happen to me . . . 
Please, sir. Don't do it." 

"Tic it," Extrone ordered. 

"No, sir. Please. Oh, please 
don't, sir." 

"Tie it," Extrone said inexorably. 

Lin bent with the rope; his facewas colorless. 

THEY were at the watering hole 
— Extrone, Lin, two bearers, 
and Ri. 

Since the hole was drying, the 
left, partially exposed bank was 
steep toward the muddy water. 
Upon it was green, new grass, tcnder-tuffed, half mashed in places 
by heavy animal treads. It was there 
that they staked him out, tying the 
free end of the rope tightly around 
the base of a scaling tree. 

"You will scream," Extrone instructed. With his rifle, he pointed 
across the water hole. "The farn 
beast will come from this direction, 
I imagine." 

Ri was almost slobbering in fear. 

"Let me hear you scream," Extrone said. 

Ri moaned weakly. 



16 




 



"You'll have to do better than 
that." Extrone inclined his head 
toward a bearer, who used something Ri couldn't see. 

Ri screamed. 

"See that you keep it up that 
way," Extrone said. "That's the way 
I want you to sound." He turned 
toward Lin. "We can climb this 
tree, I think." 

Slowly, aided by the bearers, the 
two men climbed the tree, bark 
peeling away from under their 
rough boots. Ri watched them hopelessly. 

Once at the crotch, Extrone 
settled down, holding the rifle at 
. alert. Lin moved to the left, out on 
the main branch, rested in a smaller 
crotch. 

Looking down, Extrone said, 
"Scream!" Then, to Lin, "You feel 
the excitement? It's always in the 
air like this at a hunt." 

"I feel it," Lin said. 

Extrone chuckled. "You were 
with me on Meizque?" 

"Yes." 

"That was something, that time." 
He ran his hand along the stock 
of the weapon, 

The sun headed west, veiling itself with trees; a large insect circled 
Extrone's head. He slapped at it, 
angry. The forest was quiet, underlined by an occasional piping call, 
something like a whistle. Ri's 
screams were shrill, echoing away, 
shiveringly. Tin sat quiet, hunched. 

Extrone's eyes narrowed, and 
he began to pet the gun stock 

HUNT THE HUNTER 



with quick, jerky movements. Lin 
licked his lips, keeping his eyes on 
Extrone's face. The sun seemed 
stuck in the sky, and the beat 
squeezed against them, sucking at 
their breath like a vacuum. The insect went away. Still, endless, hopeless, monotonous, Ri screamed. 

AFARN beast coughed, far in 
the matted forest. 
Extrone laughed nervously. "He 
must have heard." 

"We're lucky to rouse one so 
fast," Lin said. 

Extrone dug his boot cleats into 
the tree, braced himself. "I like 
this. There's more excitement in 
waiting like this than in anything 
I know." 
Lin nodded. 

"The waiting, itself, is a lot. The 
suspense. It's not only the killing 
that matters." 

"It's not only the killing," Lin 
echoed. 

"You understand?" Extrone said. 
"How it is to wait, knowing in 
just a minute something is going 
to come out of the forest, and 
you're going to kill it?" 

"I know," Lin said. 

"But it's not only the killing. 
It's the waiting, too." 

The farn beast coughed again; 
nearer. 

"It's a different one," Lin said. 
"How do you know?" 
"Hear the lower pitch, the more 
of a roar?" 

"Hey!" Extrone shouted. "You, 

17 



down there. There are two coming. 
Now let's hear you really scream!" 

Ri, below, whimpered childishly 
and began to retreat toward the 
tether tree, his eyes wide. 

"There's a lot of satisfaction in 
fooling them, too," Extrone said. 
"Making them come to your bait, 
where you can get at them." He 
opened his right hand. "Choose 
your ground, set your trap. Bait 
it.*' He snapped his hand into a 
fist, held the fist up before his eyes, 
imprisoning the idea. "Spring the 
trap when the quarry is inside. 
Clever. That makes the waiting 
more interesting. Waiting to see if 
they really will come to your bait." 

Lin shifted, staring toward the 
forest. 

"I've always liked to hunt," Estrone said. "More than anything 
else, I think." 

Lin spat tow a rd th e gro u nd . 
"People should hunt because they 
have to. For food. For safety." 

"No," Extrone argued. "People 
should hunt for the love of hunting-" 

"Killing?" 

"Hunting," Extrone repeated 
harshly. 

TH E f am beast coughed. Another answered. They were 
very near, and there was a noise of 
crackling underbrush. 

"He's good bait," Extrone said. 
"He's fat enough and he knows 
how to scream good." 

Ri had stopped screaming; he 



was huddled against the tree, fearfully eying the forest across from 
the watering hole. 

Extrone began to tremble* with 
excitement. "Here they come!" 

The forest sprang apart. Extrone 
bent forward, the gun still across 
his lap. 

.The farn beast, its tiny eyes red 
with hate, stepped out on the bank, 
swinging its head wildly, its nostrils flaring in anger. It coughed. 
Its mate appeared beside it. Their 
tails* thrashed against the scrubs behind them, rattling leaves. 

"Shoot!" Lin hissed. "For God's 
sake, shoot!" 

"Wait," Extrone said. "Let's see 
what they do." He had not moved 
the rifle. He was tense, bent forward, his eyes slitted, his breath 
beginning to sound like an asthmatic pump. 

The lead farn beast sighted Ri. 
It lowered its head. 

"Look!" Extrone cried excitedly. "Here it comes!" 

Ri began to scream again. 

Still Extrone did not lift his blast 
rifle. He was laughing. Lin waited, 
frozen, his eyes staring at the farn 
beast in fascination. 

The farn beast plunged into the 
water, which was shallow, and, 
throwing a sheet of it to either side, 
headed across toward Ri. 

"Watch! Watch!" Extrone cried 
gleefully. 

And then the aliens sprang their 
trap.

MR. Cleveland MeCarran 
Federal Bureau of Investigation 

Washington, D. C. 

Dear Sir: 

In compliance with your request, 
I enclose herewith a transcript of 
the pertinent sections of the journal 
of Dr. David Bannerman, deceased. 
The original document is being 



held at this office until proper disposition can be determined. 

Our investigation has shown no 
connection between Dr. Bannerman 
and any organization, subversive or 
otherwise. So far as we can learn 
he was exactly what he seemed, an 
inoffensive summer resident, retired, 
with a small independent income — 
a recluse to some extent, but well 



lllutlrated by DAVID STONE 



ANGEL'S EGG 



19 



spoken of by local tradesmen and 
other neighbors. A connection between Dr. Bannerman and the type 
of activity that concerns your Department would seem most unlikely. 

The following information is 
summarized from the earlier parts 
of Dr. Bannerman's journal, and 
tallies with the results of our own 
limited inquiry. 

He was born in 1898 at Springfield, Massachusetts, attended public school there, and was graduated 
from Harvard College in 1922, his 
studies having been interrupted by 
two years' military sen-ice. He was 
wounded in action in the Argonne, 
receiving a spinal injury. He earned 
a doctorate in Biology, 1926. Delayed after-effects of his war injury 
necessitated hospitalization. 1927'28. From 1929 to 1948 he taught 
elementary sciences in a private 
school in Boston. He published two 
textbooks in introductory biology, 
1929 and 1937. In 1948 he retired 
from teaching: a pension and a 
modest income from textbook royalties evidently made this possible. 

Aside from the spinal injury, 
which caused him to walk with a 
stoop, his health is said to have 
been fair. Autopsy findings suggested that the spinal condition 
must have given him considerable 
pain; he is not known to have mentioned this to anyone, not even his 
physician, Dr. Lester Morse. There 
is no evidence whatever of drug 
addiction or alcoholism. 



At one point early in his journal. 
Dr. Bannerman describes himself 
as "a naturalist of the puttering 
type. I would rather sit on a log 
than write monographs; it pays off 
better." Dr. Morse, and others who 
knew Dr. Bannerman personally, 
tell me that this conveys a hint of 
his personality. 

I AM not qualified to comment on 
the material of this journal, except to say that I have no evidence 
to support (or to contradict) Dr. 
Bannerman's statements. The journal has been studied only by my 
immediate superiors, by Dr. Morse, 
and by myself. I take it for granted 
you will hold the matter in strictest 
confidence. 

With the journal I am also enclosing a statement by Dr. Morse, 
written at my request for our records and for your information. You 
will note that he says, with some 
qualifications, that "death was not 
inconsistent with an embolism." Hehas signed a death certificate on 
that basis. You will recall from 
my letter of August 5 that" it was 
Dr. Morse who discovered Dr. 
Bannerman's body. Because he was 
a close personal friend of the deceased, Dr. Morse did not feel able 
to perform the autopsy himself. It 
was done by a Dr. Stephen Clyde 
of this city, and was virtually negative as regards cause of death, 
neither confirming nor contradicting Dr. Morse's original tentative 
diagnosis. If you wish to read the 



20 




 



autopsy report in full, I shall be 
glad to forward a copy. 

Dr. Morse tells me that so far as 
he knows, Dr. Bannerman had no 
near relatives. He never married. 
For the last twelve summers he 
occupied a small cottage on a back 
road about twenty-five miles from 
this city, and had few visitors. The 
neighbor Steele mentioned in the 
journal is a farmer, age 68, of good 
character, who tells me he "never 
got really acquainted with Dr. Bannerman." 

At this office we feel that unless new information comes to 
light, further active Investigation is 
hardly justified. 

Respectfully yours, 
Garrison Blaine

Augusta, Me.

EXTRACT FROM JOURNAL 
OF DAVID BANNERMAN 
JUNE 1 — JULY 29, 195 L 

IT MUST have been at least threeweeks ago when we had that 
flying saucer flurry. Observers the 
other side of Katahdin saw it come 
down this side; observers this side 
saw it come down the other. Size 
anywhere from six inches to sixty 
feet in diameter (or was it cigarshaped?) and speed whatever you 
please. Seem to recall that witnesses 
agreed on a rosy-pink light. There 
was the inevitable gobbledegookery 
of official explanation designed to 
leave everyone impressed, soothed 
and disappointed. 

I paid scant attention to the excitement and less to the explanations — naturally, I thought it 
just a flying saucer. But now 
milla has hatched out an angel. 

I have eight hens, all yearlings 
except Camilla; this is her third 
spring. I boarded her two winters 
at my neighbor Steele's farm when 
I closed this shack and shuffled my 
chilly bones off to Florida, because 
even as a pullet she had a manner 
which overbore me. I could never 
have eaten Camilla. If she had 
looked at the ax with that same expression of rancid disapproval (and 



ANGEL'S EGG 



she would ) I should have felt I 
was beheading a favorite aunt. Her 
only concession to sentiment is the 
annual rush of maternity to the 
brain — normal, for a case-hardened 
White Plymouth Rock. 

This year she stole a nest successfully, in a tangle of blackberry. 
By the time I located it, I estimated 
I was about two weeks too late. I 
had to outwit her by watching from 
a window; she is far too acute to 
be openly trailed from feeding 
ground to nest. When I had bled 
and pruned my way to her hideout, 
she wis sitting on nine eggs and 
hating my guts. They could not be 
fertile, since I keep no rooster, and 
I was about to rob her when I saw 
th e n in th egg was n ot he rs , nor 
any other chicken's. 

XT WAS a deep blue, transparent, 
A with flecks of inner light 
that made me think of the first stars 
in a clear evening. It was the same 
size as Camilla's eggs. There was 
an embryo, but nothing I could 
recognize. 

I returned the egg to Camilla's 
bare and fevered breastbone, and 
went back to the house for a long 
cool drink. I 
That was ten days ago. I know 
I ought to hare kept a record; I 
examined the blue egg every day, 
watching how some nameless lifegrew within it, until finally the 
angel chipped the shell deftly in 
two parts. This was evidently done 
with the aid of small horny out


growths on her elbows; these 
growths were sloughed off on the 
second day. 

I wish I had seen her break the 
shell, but when I visited the black- \ 
berry tangle three days ago she was 
already out. She poked her exquisite head through Camilla's neck 
feather, smiled sleepily, and snuggled back into darkness to finish 
drying off. So what could 1 do, more 
than save the broken shell and 
wriggle my clumsy self out of 
there ? 

I had removed Camilla's own 
eggs the day before — Camilla was 
only moderately annoyed. I was 
nervous about disposing of them 
even though they were obviously 
Camilla's, but no harm was done. 
I cracked each one to be sure. Very 
frankly rotten eggs and nothing 
more. 

In the evening of that day I 
thought of rats and weasels, as I 
should have earlier. I hastily prepared a box in the .kitchen and 
brought the two in, the angel quiet 
in my closed hand. They are there 
now. I think they are comfortable. 

■Three days after hatching, the " 
angel is the length of my forefinger, say three inches tall, with 
about the relative proportions of a 
six-year-old girl. Except for head, 
hands, and probably the soles of 
her feet, she is clothed in feathery 
down (lie color of ivory. What can 
be seen of her skin is a glowing 
pink — I do mean glowing, like the 
inside of certain seashells. Just

ANGEL'S EGG 



above the small of her back are 
two stubs which I take to be infantile wings. They do not suggest an 
extra pair of specialized forelimbs. 
I think they are wholly differentiated organs; perhaps they will be 
like the wings of an insect. Somehow I never thought of angels 
bu22ing. Maybe she won't. 1 know 
ver.y little about angels. 

AT PRESENT the stubs are covered with some dull tissue, 
no doubt a protective sheath to be 
discarded when the membranes (if 
they are membranes) are ready to 
grow. Between the stubs is a not 
very prominent ridge — special musculature, I suppose. Otherwise her 
shape is quite human, even to a 
pair of minuscule mammalian pinheads just visible under the down. 

How that can make sense in an 
egg-laying organism is beyond my 
comprehension. Just for the record, 
so is a Corot landscape; so is Schubert's Unfinished; so is the flight 
of a hummingbird, or the otherworld of frost on a windowpane. 

The down on her head has grown 
visibly in three days and is of different quality from the body down. 
Later it may resemble human hair, 
probably as a diamond resembles a 
chunk of granite . . . 

A curious thing has happened. 
I went to Camilla's box after writing that. Judy* was already lying 
in front of it, unexcited. The 
angel's head was out from under 
the feathers, and I thought, with 



more verbal distinctness than such 
thoughts commonly take, So here J 
am, a naturalist of middle years and 
cold sober, observing a three-inch 
oviparous mammal with down and 
wings. 

The thing is — she giggled! 

Now it might have been only 
amusement at my appearance, which 
to her must be enormously gross 
and comic. But another thought 
formed unspoken: / am no longer 
lonely. And her face, hardly bigger 
than a dime, immediately changed 
from laughter to a brooding and 
friendly thoughtfulness. 

Judy and Camilla are old friends. 
Judy seems untroubled by the 
angel. I have no worries about leaving them alone together. 

June 3 

I MADE no entry last night. The 
angel was talking to me, and 
when that was finished I drowsed 
off immediately on a cot which I 
have moved into the kitchen to be 
near them. 

I had never been strongly impressed by the evidence for extrasensory perception. It is fortunate 
that my mind was able to accept 
the novelty, since to the angel it is 
clearly a matter of course. Her tiny 
mouth is most expressive, but 
moves only for that reason and for 
eating — not for speech. Probably 

•Dr. Bannerman's dog, mentioned often 
earlier in die journal, a. nine-year-old 
English setter. According to an entry of 
May 15, 1951, she was then beginning 
to go blind— BLAINE 




 



she could speak to her own kind 
if she wished, but I dare say the 
sound would be above the range of 
my hearing as well as my understanding. 

Last night after I brought the cot 
in and was about to finish my puttering bachelor supper, she climbed 
to the edge of the box and pointed, 
first at herself and then at the top 
of the kitchen table. Afraid to let 
my vast hand take hold of her, I 
held it out flat and she sat in my 
palm. Camilla was inclined to fuss, 
but the angel looked over her shoulder and Camilla subsided, watchful 
but no longer alarmed. 

The table-top is porcelain, and 
the angel shivered. I folded a towel 
and spread a silk handkerchief on 
top of that; the angel sat on this 
arrangement with apparent comfort, 
near my face. I was not even bewildered, without realizing why. 
That doesn't seem possible, does 
it ? But there was a good reason. 

She reached me first with visual 
imagery. How can I make it plain 
that this had nothing in common 
with my sleeping dreams? There 
was no weight of symbolism from 
my littered past, no discoverable 
connection with any of yesterday's 
commonplaces, indeed no actual involvement of my personality at all. 
I saw. I was moving vision, though 
without eyes or other flesh. And 
while my mind saw, it also knew 
where my flesh was. seated at the 
kitchen table. If anyone had entered 
the kitchen, it there had been a 



noise of alarm out in the henhouse, 
I should have known it. 

THERE was a valley such as I 
have not seen, and never will, 
on Earth. I have seen many beautiful places on this planet — some of 
them were even tranquil. Once I 
took a slow steamer to New Zealand and had the Pacific as a play 
thing for many days. I can hardly 
say how I knew this was not Earth. 
The grass of the valley was a 
familiar green. A river below me 
was a blue and silver thread under 
sunlight. There were trees much 
like pine and maple, and maybe 
that is what they were. But it was 
not Earth. I was aware of mountains heaped to strange heights on 
cither side of the valley — snow, 
rose, amber, gold. The amber tint 
was unlike any mountain color I 
have noticed in this world at midday. 

Or I may have known it was not 
Earth, simply because her mind — 
dwelling within some unimaginable 
brain smaller than the tip of my 
little finger — told me so. 

I watched two inhabitants of that 
world come flying, to rest in the 
field of sunny grass where my bodiless vision had brought me. Adul; 
forms, such as my angel would 
surely be when she had her growth, 
except that both of these were male 
and one of them was dark-skinned. 
The latter was also old, with a 
thousand-wrinkled face, knowing 
and full of tranquiUity; the other 



ANGEL'S EGG 



23 



was flushed and lively with youth. 
Both were beautiful. The down of 
the brown-skinned old one was 
reddish-tawny; the other's was 
ivory with hints of orange. Their 
wings were true membranes, with 
more variety of subtle iridescence 
than I have seen even in the wings 
of a dragon-fly; I could not say 
that any color was . dominant, for 
each motion brought a ripple of 
change. 

These two sat at their ease on 
the grass. I realized that they were 
talking to each other, though their 
lips did not move in speech more 
than once or twice. They would 
nod, smile, now and then illustrate 
something with twinkling hands. 

A huge rabbit lolloped past them. 
I knew — thanks to my own angel's 
efforts, I supposed — that this animal was of the same size as oxtr 
common wild ones. Later a bluegreen snake three times the size of 
the angels came flowing through 
the grass. The old one reached out 
to stroke its head carelessly, and I 
think he did it without interrupting whatever he was saying. 

Another creature came in leisured 
leaps. He was monstrous, yet I felt 
no .alarm in the angels or myself. 
Imagine a being built somewhat 
like a kangaroo up to the head, 
about eight feet tall, and katydidgreen. Really the thick balancing 
tail and enormous legs were the 
only kangaroolike features about 
him. The body above the massive 
thighs was not dwarfed, but thick 



and square. The arms and hands 
were quite humanoid, and the head 
was round, manlike except for its 
face — there was only a single 
nostril and his mouth was set in 
the vertical. The eyes were large 
and mild. 

I received an impression of high 
intelligence and natural gentleness. 

In one of his manlike hands he 
carried two tools, so familiar and 
ordinary that I knew my body by 
the kitchen table had laughed in 
startled recognition. But after all, 
a garden spade and rake are basic. 
Once invented — -I expect we did it 
ourselves in the Neolithic — there is 
little reason why they should change 
much down the millennia. 

This farmer halted by the angels, 
and the three conversed a while. 
The big head nodded agreeably. I 
believe the young angel made a 
j oke ; certainly the convuls ions in 
the huge green face ma.de me think 
of laughter. Then this amiable 
monster turned up the grass in a 
patch a few yards square, broke the 
sod and raked the surface smooth, 
just as any competent gardener 
might do, except that he moved 
with the relaxed smoothness of a 
being whose strength far exceeds 
the requirements of his task . . . 

I WAS back in my kitchen with 
everyday eyes. My angel was 
exploring the table. I had a loaf 
of bread there, and a dish of strawberries in cream. She was trying a 
breadcrumb, seemed to like it fair



 



ly well. I offered the strawberries. 
She broke off one of the seeds and 
nibbled it, but didn't care so much 
for the pulp. I held xip the great 
spoon with sugary cream. She 
steadied it with both hands to try 
some. I think she liked it. 

It had been stupid of me not to 
realize that she would be hungry. 
I brought wine from the cupboard; 
she watched inquiringly, so I put a 
couple of drops on the handle of a 
spoon. The taste really pleased her. 
She chuckled and patted her tiny 
stomach, though I'm afraid it 
wasn't very good sherry. I brought 
some crumbs of cake, but she indicated that she was full, came 
close to my face and motioned me 
to lower my head. 

She reached up until she could 
press both hands against my forehead — I felt it only enough to know 
her hands were there — and she 
stood so a long time, trying to tell 
me something. 

It was difficult. Pictures come 
through with relative ease, but now 
she was transmitting an abstraction of a complex kind. My clumsy 
brain suffered in the effort to receive. Something did come across, 
but I have only the crudest way of 
passing it on. Imagine an equilateral 
triangle; place the following words 
one at each corner — "recruiting," 
"collecting," "saving." The meaning she wanted to convey ought to 
be near the center of the triangle. 

I had also the sense that her 
message provided a partial explana


tion of her errand in this lovable 
and damnable world. 

She looked weary when she stood 
away from me. I put out my palm 
and she climbed into it, to be carried back to the nest. 

She did not talk to me tonight, 
nor eat, but she gave a reason, coming out from Camilla's feathers 
long enough to turn her back and 
show me the wing-stubs. The protective sheaths have dropped off; 
the wings are rapidly growingHiey are probably damp and weak. 
. She was quite tired and went back 
into the warm darkness almost ai 
once. 

Camilla must be exhausted. 
I don't think she has been off 
nest more than twice since I bro 
them into the house. 



back 



June 4 

rpODAY she can fly. 
-L I learned it in the afternoon, 
when I was fiddling about in the 
garden and Judy was loafing in the 
sunshine she loves. Something apart 
from sight and sound called me to 
hurry back to the house. I saw my 
angel through the screen door before I opened it. One of her feet 
had caught in a hideous loop of 
loose wire at a break in the mesh. 
Her first tug of alarm must have 
tightened the loop so that her hands 
were not strong enough to force it 
open. 

Fortunately I was able to cut the 
wire with a pair of shears before I 
lost my head; then she could free 



ANGEL'S EGG

her foot -without injury. Camilla 
had been frantic, rushing around 
fluffed up, but- — here's an odd thing 
- — perfectly silent. None of the 
recognized chicken -noises of dismay. If an ordinary chick had been 
in trouble, she would have raised 
the roof. 

THE angel flew to me and hovered, pressing her hands on my, 
forehead. The message was clear at 
once: "No harm done." She flew 
down to tell Camilla the same 
thing. 

Yes, in the same way. I saw Camilla standing near my feet with 
her neck out and head low, and the 
angel put a hand on either side of 
her scraggy comb. Camilla relaxed, 
clucked in the normal way, and 
;prcad her wings for a shelter. The 
angel went under it, but only to 
oblige Camilla, I think — at least, 
she stuck her head through the 
•wing feathers and winked. 

She must have seen something 
else then, for she came out and 
flew back to me and touched a 
finger to my cheek, looked at the 
finger, saw it was wet, put it in her 
mouth, made a face, and laughed 
at me. 

We went outdoors into the sun 
(Camilla, too) and the angel gave 
me an exhibition of what flying 
ought to be. Not even Wagner can 
speak of joy as her first free flying 
did. At one moment she would be 
hanging in front of my eyes, radiant and delighted; the next instant 



she wbuld be a dot of color against 
a cloud. Try to imagine something 
that would make a hummingbird 
seem dull and sluggish! 

They do hum. Softer than a 
hummingbird; louder than a 
dragonfly. Something like the sound 
of hawk-moths — He maris tb/sbc, 
for instance, the one I used to call 
Hummingbird Moth when I was a 
child. 

I was frightened, naturally. 
Frightened first at what might 
happen to her, but that was unnecessary; I don't think she would 
be in danger from any savage animal except possibly Man. I saw a 
Cooper's hawk slant down the invisible toward the swirl of color 
where she was dancing by herself. 
Presently she was drawing iridescent 
rings around him. Then, while he 
soared in smaller circles, I could 
not see her, but . (maybe she felt 
my fright) she was again in front 
of me, pressing my forehead in the 
now familiar way. 

I knew she was amused, and 
caught the idea that the hawk was 
a "lazy character." Not quite the 
way I'd describe Accipiter Cooper's, 
but it's all in the point of view. I 
believe she had been riding his 
back, no doubt with her telepathic 
hands on his predatory head. 

Later I was frightened by the 
thought that she might not want to 
return to me. Could I compete with 
sunlight and open sky? The passage 
of that terror through me brought 
her swiftly back, and her hands

said with great clarity: "Don't ever 
be afraid of anything. It isn't nec- ' 
cssary for you." 

Once this afternoon I was 
saddened by the realization that old 
Judy can take little part in what 
goes on now. I can well remember 
Judy running Jike the wind. The 
angel must have heard this thought 
in me, fo£ she stood a long time 
beside Judy's drowsy head, while 
Judy's tail thumped cheerfully on 
the warm grass . . . 

IN THE evening the angel made 
a heavy meal on two or three 
cake crumbs and another drop of 
sherry, and we had what was almost a sustained conversation. I 
will write it in that form this time, 
rather than grope for anything more 
exact. 

1 asked her: "How far away is 
your home?" 

"My home is here." 

"I meant the place your people 
came from." 

"Ten light years." 

"Hie images you showed me — 
that quiet valley — that is ten light 
years away?" 

"Yes. But that was my father 
talking to you, through me. He 
was grown when the journey began. He is two hundred and forty 
years old — our years, thirty-two 
days longer than each of yours." 

Mainly I was conscious of a 
flood of relief. T had feared, on 
the basis of terrestrial biology*, that 
her explosively rapid growth after 



hatching must foretell a brief life. 
But it's all right — she can outlive 
me, and by a few hundred years at 
that. 

"Your father is here now, on 
this planet? Shall I see him?" 

She took her hands away — 
listening, I believe. Hie answer 
was: "No. He is sorry. He is ill 
and cannot live long. I am to sec 
him in a few days, when I fly a 
little better. He taught me for 
twenty years after I was born." 

"I don't understand. I thought 
that — " 

"Later, friend. My father is 
grateful for your kindness to me." 

I don't know what I thought 
about that. I felt no faintest trace 
of condescension in the message. 

"And he was showing me things 
he had seen with his own eyes, ten 
light years away?" 

"Yes." Then she wanted me to 
rest a while; I am sure she knows 
what a huge effort it is for my 
primitive brain to function in this 
way. But before she ended the conversation by humming down to her 
nest she gave me this, and I received it with such clarity that I 
cannot be mistaken : "He says that 
only fifty million years ago it was 
a jungle there, just as Terra is 
now." 

June 8 

WHEN I woke four days ago, 
the angel was having breakfast, and little Camilla was dead. 
The angel watched me rub sleep 



ANGEL'S EGG

out of my eyes, watched me discover Camilla, and then flew to me. 

I received this: "Docs it make 
you unhappy?" 

"I don't know exactly." You can 
get fond of a hen, especially a cantankerous and homely old one 
whose personality has a lot in common with your own. 

"She was old. She wanted a flock 
of chicks, and I couldn't stay with 
her. So I — ' ' something obscure 
here;, probably my mind was trying 
too hard to grasp it — -"so I saved 
her life." I could make nothing 
else out of it. She said "saved." 

Camilla's death looked natural, 
except that I should have expected 
the death contractions to muss the 
straw and that hadn't happened. 
Maybe the angel had arranged the 
old lady's body for decorum, 
though I don't sec how her muscular strength would have been 
equal to it, Camilla weighed at least 
seven pounds. 

As I was burying her at the edge 
of the garden and the angel was 
humming over my head, I recalled 
a thing which, when it happened, 
I had dismissed as a dream. Merely 
a moonlight image of the angel 
standing in the. nest box with her 
hands on Camilla's head, then pressing her mouth gently on Camilla's 
throat, just' before the hen's head 
sank down out of my line of vision. 
Probably I actually awoke and saw 
it happen. I am somehow unconcerned — even, as I think more about 
it, pleased. 



After the burial the angel's 
hands said: "Sit on the grass and 
we'll talk. Question me; I'll tell you 
what I can. My father asks you to 
write it down.'' 

So that is what we have been 
doine, for the last four days. I have 
been going to school, a slow but 
willing pupil. Rather than enter 
anything in this" journal,' for in the 
evenings I was exhausted, I made 
notes as best I could. The angel has 
gone now to see her father and 
will nof return until morning. I 
shall try to make a readable version 
of my notes. 

Since she had invited questions, 
I began with something which had 
been bothering me, as a would-be 
naturalist, exceedingly. I couldn't 
see how creatures no larger than 
the adults I had observed could lay 
eggs, as large as Camilla's. Nor 
could I understand why, if they 
were hatched in an almost adult 
condition and able to eat a varied 
diet, she had any use for that 
ridiculous, lovely and apparently 
functional pair of breasts. 

WHEN the angel grasped my 
difficulty, she exploded with 
laughter — her kind, which buzzed 
her all over the garden and caused 
her to fluff my hair on the wing 
and pinch my carlobe. She lit on a 
rhubarb leaf and gave a delcctably 
naughty representation of herself as 
a hen laying an egg, including the 
cack 1 e . She got m c to bumbl i ng 
helplessly— my kind of laughter— 


 



and it was some time before we 
couUl quiet down. Then she did 
her best to explain. 

They are true mammals, and the 
young — not more than two or at 
most three in a lifetime averaging 
two hundred and fifty years— arc 
delivered in very much the human 
way. The baby is nursed, human 
fashion, until his brain begins to 
respond .1 little to their unspoken 
language. That takes three to four 
yreeks. Then he is placed in an altogether different medium. 

She could not describe that clearly, because there was very little in 
my educational storehouse to help 
me grasp it. It is some gaseous medium which arrests bodily growth 
for an almost indefinite period, 
while mental growth continues. It 
took them, she says, about seven 
thousand years to perfect this 
technique after they first hit on the 
idea; they are never in a hurry. 

The infant remains under this 
delicate and precise control tor anywhere from fifteen to thirty years, 
the period depending not only on 
his mental vigor, but also on the 
type of lifcwork he tentatively 
elects as soon as his brain is knowing enough to make a choice. During this period his mind is guided 
with patience by teachers who — 

IT SEEMS those teachers know 
their business. This was peculiarly difficult for me to assimilate, although the facts came through 
clearly enough. In their world, the 



profession of teacher is more highly honored than any other — can 
such a thing be possible? — and so 
difficult to enter that only the 
strongest minds dare to attempt it. 

I had to rest a while after absorbing that. 

An aspirant must spend fifty 
years, not including the period of 
infantile education, merely getting 
ready to begin, and the acquisition 
of factual knowledge, while not 
undcrstressed, takes only a small 
proportion of those fifty years. 
Then, if he's good enough, he can 
take a small part in the elementary 
instruction of a few babies, and if 
he does well on that basis for another thirty or forty years, he is 
considered a fair beginner ... 

Once upon a time I myself 
lurched around stuffy classrooms, 
trying to insert a few predigested 
facts — I wonder how many of them 
were facts — into the minds of bored 
and preoccupied adolescents, *;ome 
of whom may have liked me moderately wcl 1 . I was even abl e to 
shake hands and be nice while their 
terribly well-meaning parents explained to me how they ought to 
be educated. So much of our human 
effort goes down the drain of futility, I sometimes wonder how wc 
ever got as far as the Bronze Age. 
Somehow we did, "though, and a 
short way beyond. 

After that preliminary stage of 
an angel's education is finished, the 
baby is transferred to more ordinary 
surroundings, and his bodily 



ANGEL'S EGG

growth completes itself in a very 
short time. Wings grow abruptly, 

as I have seen, and he reaches a 
maximum height of six inches by 
our measure. Only then docs he 
enter on that lifetime of two hundred and fifty years, for not until 
then dots his body begin to age. 
My angel has been a living personality for many years, but will not 
celebrate her first birthday for almost a year. I like to think of that. 

At about the same time that they 
learned the principles of interplanetary travel, approximately 
twelve million years ago, these people also learned how growth could 
be rearrested at any point short of 
full maturity. At first the knowledge served no purpose except in 
the control of illnesses which still 
occasionally struck them at that 
time. But when the long periods 
of time required for space travel 
were considered, the advantages 
became obvious. 

SO IT happens that my angel 
was born ten light years away. 
She was trained by her father and 
many others in the wisdom of seventy million years— that, she tells 
me, is the approximate sum of their 
recorded history — and then she was 
safely sealed and .cherished in what 
my supcramebic brain regarded as 
a blue egg. Education did not proceed at that time; her mind went 
to sleep with the rest of her. When 
Camillas warmth made her wake 
and grow again, she remembered 



what to do with the little horny 
bumps provided for her elbows. 
And came out into this planet, God 
help her. 

I wondered why her father 
should have chosen any combination so unreliable as an old hen 
and a human being. Surely he must 
have had plenty of excellent ways 
to bring the shell to the right temperature. Her answer should have 
satisfied me immensely, but I am 
still compelled to wonder about it: 

"Camilla was a nice hen, and 
my father studied your mind while 
you were asleep. It was a bad landing, and much was broken — no 
such landing was ever made before 
after so long a journey. Only four 
other grown-ups could come with 
my father. Three of them died en 
route and he is very ill. And there 
were nine other children to care 
for." 

Yes, I knew she'd said that an 
angel thought I was good enough 
to be trusted with his daughter. If 
it upsets me. all I need do is look 
at her and then in the mirror. As 
for the explanation, 1 can only conclude there must be more which I 
am not ready to understand. I was 
worried about thjose nine others, 
but she assured mc they were all 
well, and I sensed that 1 ought not 
to ask more about them at present. 

THEIR planet, she says, is closely similar to this, a trifle larger, 
moving in a somewhat longer orbit 
around a sun like ours. Two gleam


32 




 



ing moons, smaller than ours — their 
orbits arc .such that two-moon 
nights come rarely; they are 
"magic, " and she will ask her 
father to show me one, if he can. 
Because of a slower rotation, their 
day has twenty-six of our hours. 
Their atmosphere is mainly nitrogen and oxygen in the proportion 
familiar to us; slightly richer in 
some of the rare gases. The climate 
is now what we should call tropical 
and subtropical, but they have 
known glacial rigors like those in 
our world's past. There arc only two 
great continental land masses, and 
many thousands of large islands. 

Their total population is only 
five billion. 

It seems my angel wants to become a student of animal life here 
on Earth. I, her teacher ! But bless 
her for the notion anyhow. We sat 
and traded animals for a couple of 
hours last night; 1 found it restful, 
after the mental struggle to grasp 
more difficult matters. Judy was 
something new to her. They have 
several luscious monsters on that 
planet, but, in her view, .so have 
we. 

She told me of a blue sea-snake 
fifty feet long, relatively harmless, 
th.il bellows cowlike and comes 
into the tidal marshes to lay black 
eggs; so I gave her a whale. She 
offered a bat-winged, day-flying 
ball of mammalian fluff as big as 
my head and weighing under an 
ounce; I matched her with a marmoset. She tried me with a small


size pink brontosaur, very rare, but 
I was reaJy with the duck-bitted 
platypus, and that caused us to exchange some pretty funny remarks 
about mammalian eggs. All trivial 
in a way; also the happiest evening 
in my fifty-three tangled years of 
life. 

She was a trifle hesitant to explain those kangaroolikc people, 
until she was sure I really wanted 
to know. It seems they arc about 
the nearest parallel to human life 
on that planet; not a near parallel, 
of course, as she was careful to explain. Agreeable and always friendly souls, though they weren't always 
so, I'm sure, and of a somewhat 
more alert intelligence than we 
possess. Manual workers mainly, because they prefer it nowadays, but 
some of them are excellent mathematicians. The first practical spaceship was built by a group of them, 
with assistance, of course. 

Names offer a difficulty. Because 
of the nature of the angelic language, they have scant use for them 
except for the purpose of written 
record, and writing naturally plays 
little part in their daily life- — no 
occasion to write a letter when distance is no obstacle to the speech 
of your mind. An angel's formal 
name is about as important to him, 
as, say, my Social Security number 
is to me. 

SHE has not told me hers, because my mind can't grasp the 
phonetics on which their written 



34 




 



language is based. As we would 
speak a friend's name, an angel 
will project the friend's image to 
his friend's receiving mind. More 
rneasant and more intimate, 1 think, 
although it was a shock to me at 
first to glimpse my own ugly mug 
in my mind's eye. 

Stories arc occasionally written, 
if there is something in them that 
should be preserved precisely as it 
was in the first telling. But in their 
world ihc true story-teller has a 
more important place than the 
printer. He offers one of the best 
of their quieter pleasures; a good 
one can hold his audience for a 
week and never tire them. 

"What is this 'angel' in your 
mind when you think of me?" she 
asked once. 

' ' A being men have imagined 
for cen curies, when they thought 
of themselves as they might like to 
be, and not as they are." 

I did not try too painfully hard 
to learn much about the principles 
of space travel. The most my brain 
could take in of her explanation 
was something like: "Rocket, then 
phototropism." Now that makes 
scant sense. So far as I know, phototropism— movement toward light — 
is an . organic phenomenon. One 
thinks of it as a response of protoplasm, in some plants and animal 
organisms, most of them simple, to 
the stimulus of light; certainly not 
as a force capable of moving inorganic matter. 

I think that whatever may be the 



principle she was describing, this 
word phototropism was merely the 
nearest thing to it in my reservoir 
of language. If I did know the 
physical principles which brought 
them here, and could write them 
in terms accessible to technicians, I 
would not do it. 

Here is a thing I am afraid no 
hypothetical reader of this journal 
would believe: 

These people, as I have written, 
learned their method of space 
travel some twelve million years 
ago, yet this is the first time they 
have ever used it to convey them to 
another planet. The heavens are 
rich in worlds, she tells me; on 
many of them there is life, often 
on very primitive levels. No external force prevented her people 
from going forth, colonizing, conquering, as far as they pleased. 
They could have populated a whole 
Galaxy. They did not, because they 
believed they were not ready. More 
precisely— 

Not good enough! 

ONLY fifty million years ago, by 
her account, did they learn, 
as we may learn eventually, that 
intelligence without goodness is 
worse than high explosive in the 
hands of a baboon. For beings advanced beyond the level of Pithecanthropus, intelligence is a cheap 
commodity — not too hard to develop, hellishly easy to use for unconsidered ends. Whereas goodness 
is not to be achieved without un

ending effort of tlic hardest kind, 
within the self, whether the self be 
man or angel 

It is clear even, to me that the 
conquest of evil is only one step, 
not the most important. Goodness, 
she tried to tell me, is an altogether 
positive quality; the part of living 
nature that swarms with such monstrosities as cruelty, meanness, bitterness, greed is not to be filled by 
a vacuum when these horrors are 
eliminated. 

Kindness, for only one example. 
Anybody who defines kindness only 
as the absence of cruelty doesn't 
understand the nature of either. 

THEY d!o not aim at perfection, 
these angels, only at the attainable. They passed through 
many millenia while advances in 
technology merely worsened their 
condition and increased the peril 
of self-annihilation. They came 
through that, in time. War was at 
length so far outgrown that its recurrence was impossible, and the 
development of wholly rational beings could begin. Then they were 
ready to start growing up, through 
more millenia of self-searching, 
self -discipline, seeking to earn the 
simple out of the complex, discovering how to use knowledge and 
not be used by it. Even then, of 
course, they slipped back often 
enough. There were what she refers 
to as eras of fatigue. In their dimmer past, they had had many dark 
ages, lost civilizations, hopeful be


ginnings ending in dust. Earlier 
still they had come out of the slime, 
as we did. 

But their period of deepest uncertainty and sternest self -appraisal 
did not come until twelve million 
years ago, when they knew a Universe could be theirs 'for the taking, and knew they were not yet 
good enough. 

They are in no more hurry than 
the stars. She tried to convey something, tentatively, at this point, 
which was ' really beyond both of 
us. It had to do with time (not as 
I understand time) being perhaps 
the most essential attribute of God 
(not as I was ever able to understand that word). Seeing my mental exhaustion, she gave up the 
effort, and later told me that the 
conception was extremely difficult 
for her, too — not only, I gathered, 
because of her youth and relative 
ignorance. There was also a hint 
that her father might not have 
wished her to bring my brain up to 
a hurdle like that one . . . 

Of course they explored. Their 
little spaceships were roaming the 
ether before there was anything 
like man on Earth — roaming and 
listening, observing, recording; 
never entering nor talcing part in. 
the life of any home but their own. 
For five million years they even 
forbade themselves to go beyond 
their own solar system, though it 
would have been easy to do so. 
And in the following seven million 
years, although they traveled to in



 



credible distances, the same stern 
restraint was held in force. 

It was altogether unrelated to 
what we should call fear. That, I 
think, is as extinct in them as hate. 
There was so much to do at home! 
I wish I could- imagine it. They 
mapped the heavens, and played in 
their own sunlight. 

Naturally I cannot tell you what 
goodness is. I know only, moderately well, what it seems to mean 
to us human beings. It appears that 
the best of us can, often with enormous difficulty, however, achieve a 
manner of life in which goodness 
somewhat overbalances our aggressive, hostile tendencies for the 
greater part of the time. We are, 
in other words, a f raction alive ; 
the rest is in the dark. Dante was 
a bitter masochist; Beethoven a 
frantic and miserable snob, Shakespeare wrote potboilers. And 
Christ said: "My Father, if it be 
possible, let this cup pass from 
me." 

But give us fifty million years — 
I am no pessimist. After all, I've 
watched one-celled organisms on 
the slide, and listened to Brahms' 
Fourth. Night before last I said to 
the angel: "In spite of everything, 
you and I are kindred." 

She granted me agreement. 

June 9 

SHE was lying on my pillow 
this morning so that I could 
see her when 1 awoke. 

Her father has died, and slit was 



with him when it happened. There 
was again that thought-impression 
which I could interpret only to 
mean that his life had been 
"saved." 1 was still sleep-bound 
when my mind asked: "What will 
you do?" 

"Stay with you, if you wish il, 
for the rest of your life." The last 
part of the message was clouded, 
but I am familiar with that now. It 
seems to mean there is some further 
element which eludes me. I could 
not be mistaken about the part I 
did receive. It gives me amazing 
speculations. Being only fifty-three, 
I might live another thirty or forty 
years. 

She was preoccupied this morning, but whatever she felt about 
her father's death that might be 
paralleled by sadness in a human 
being was hidden from me. She 
did say her father was sorry he had 
not been able to -show me a twomoon night. 

One adult, then, remains in this 
world. Except to say that he is two 
hundred years old and full of 
knowledge, and that he endured the 
long journey without serious il! 
effects, she has told me little about 
him. And there are ten children 
including herself. 

Something was sparkling at her 
throat. When she was aware of my 
interest in it, she took it off and I 
fetched a magnifying glass. A necklace; under the glass, much like our 
finest human workmanship, if your 
imagination can reduce it to the 



ANGEL'S EGG 



proper scale. The stones appeared 
similar to the jewels we know; diamonds, sapphires, rubies, emeralds, 
the diamonds snapping out every 
color under heaven; but there were 
two or three very dark purple 
Stoa.es unlike anything I know — 
not amethysts, I am sure. The necklace was strung on something more 
slender than cobweb, and the design of the joining clasp was too 
delicate for my glass to help me. 
The necklace had been her 
mother's, she told me. As she put 
it back around her throat, I thought 
I saw the same shy pride that any 
human girl might feel in displaying a new pretty. 

She wanted to show me other 
things she had brought, and flew 
to the table where she had left a 
Sort of satchel an inch and a half 
long — quite a load for her to fly 
with, but the translucent substance 
is so light that when she rested the 
satchel on my finger I scarcely felt 
it. She arranged a few articles eagerly for my inspection, and I put 
the glass to work again. 

One was a jeweled comb; she 
ran it through the down on her 
chest and legs to show me its use. 
There was a set of tools too small 
for the glass to interpret them; I 
learned later they were a sewing 
kit. A book, and some writing instrument much like a metal pencil. 
The book, I understand, is a blank 
record for her to use as needed. 

And finally, when I was fulLy 
awake and dressed and we had fin


ished breakfast, she reached in the 
bottom of the satchel for a parcel 
that was heavy for her and made 
me understand it was a gift for me. 
"My father made it for you, but I 
put in the stone myself, last night." 
She unwrapped it. A ring, precisely 
the size for my little finger. 

IiBROKE down somewhat. She 
understood that, and sat on my 
shoulder patting my earlobe till I 
had command of myself. 

I have no idea what the jewel 
is. It shifts with the light from 
purple to jade green to amber. The 
metal resembles platinum in appearance, except for a tinge of rose at 

certain angles of light. When I 
stare into the stone, I think I see — 
never mind that now. I am not 
ready to write it down, and perhaps 

never will be, unless I am sure. 

We improved our housekeeping, 
later in the morning. I showed her 
over the house. It isn't much — Cape 
Codder, two rooms up and two 1 
down. Every corner interested her, 
and when she found a shocbox in 
the bedroom closet, she asked for 
it. At her direction, I have arranged 
it on a chest near my bed and the 
window which shall be always 
open. She says the mosquitoes will 
not bother me, and I don't doubt 
her. 

I unearthed a white silk scarf for 
the bottom of the box. After ask-' 
ing my permission — as if I could 
want to refuse her anything!- — she 
got her sewing kit and snipped off 



31 




 



a piece of the scarf several inches 
square, folded it on itself several 
times, and sewed it into a narrow 
pillow an inch long. So now she 
has a proper bed and a room of her 
own. I wish I had something less 
coarse than silk, but she insists she's 
pleased with it. 

We have not talked very much 
today. In the afternoon she flew 
Out for an hour's play in the cloudcountry. When s}ie returned, she 
let me know that she needed a long 
sleep. She is still sleeping, I think. 
I am writing this" downstairs, fearing the light might disturb her. 

Is it possible I can have thirty 
or forty years in her company? I 
wonder how teachable my mind 
still is. I seem to be able to assimilate new facts as well as I ever 
could; this ungainly carcass should 
be durable, with reasonable care. 
Of course, facts without a synthesizing imagination are no better 
than scattered bricks, but perhaps 

my imagination — 
I don't know. 

Judy wants out. I shall turn in 
when she conies back. I wonder if 
poor Judy's life could be — the word 
is certainly "saved." I must ask. 

June 10 

LAST night when I stopped 
writing I did go to bed, but I 
was resdess, refusing sleep. At 
some time in the small hours — thorc 
was light from a single moon — she 
flew over to me. The tensions dissolved away like an illness and my 



mind was able to respond with a 
certain calm. 

I made plain that I would never 
willingly part company with her, 
which I am sure she already knew, 
and she gave me to understand that 
there are two alternatives for the 
remainder of my life. The choice, 
she says, is altogether mine, and 1 
must take time to be sure of my 
decision. 

I can live out my natural span, 
whatever it proves to be, and she 
will not leave me for long at any 
time. She will be there to .advise, 
teach, help me in anything good I 
care to undertake. She says she 
would enjoy thi»; for some reason 
she is, as we'd say in our language, 
fond of me. 

Lord, the books I could write! I 
fumble for words now, in the usual 
human way. Whatever 1 put on 
paper is a miserable fraction of the 
potential; the words themselves are 
rarely the right ones. But under 
her guidance — 

I could take a fair part in shaking the world. With words alone. 
I could preach to my owq people. 
Before long, I would be heard. 

I could study and explore. What 
small nibblings we have made at 
the sum of available knowledge! 
Suppose I brought in one leaf from 
outdoors, or one common little bug 
— in a few hours of studying it with 
her, I'd know more of my own specialty than a flood of the best textbooks could tell me. 

She has also let me know that 



ANGEL'S EGG 



39 



when she and those who came with 
her have learned a little more about 
humanity, it should be possible to 
improve ray health greatly, and 
probably my life expectancy. I don't 
imagine my back could ever 
straighten, but she thinks the pain 
might be cleared away, entirely 
without drugs. I could have a 
clearer mind, in a body that would 
neither fail nor torment me. 

Then there is the other alternative. 

It seems they have developed a 
technique by means of which any 
unresisting living subject, whose 
brain is capable of memory at all, 
can experience total recall. It is a 
by-product, I understand, of their 
silent speech, and a very recent one. 
They have practiced it foe only a 
few thousand years, and since their 
own understanding of the phenomenon is very incomplete, they 
classify it among their experimental techniques. 

In a general way, it may somewhtf resemble that reliving of the 
past which psychoanalysis can sometimes bring about in a limited way 
for therapeutic purposes. But you 
must imagine that sort of thing tremendously magnified and clarified, 
capable of including every detail 
which has ever registered on the 
subject's brain. 

THE purpose is not therapeutic, 
as we would understand it; 
quite the opposite. The end result 

is — -death. 



Whatever is recalled by this 
process is transmitted to the receiving mind, which can retain it, and 
record any or all of it, if such a 
record is desired; but to the subject 
who recalls, it is a flowing away, 
without return. Thus it is not a 
true "remembering," but a giving. 
The mind is swept clear, naked of 
all its past, and, along with memory, life withdraws also. Very 
quietly. 

At the end, I suppose it must be 
like standing without resistance in 
the engulfmcnt of a flood tide, until finally the waters close over. 

That, it seems, is how Camilla's 
life was "saved." When I finally 
grasped that, I laughed, and the 
angel of course caught the reason. 
I was thinking about my neighbor 
Steele, who boarded Camilla for 
me In his henhouse for a couple of 
winters. 

Somewhere safe in the an.gelic records there must be a hen'seyc image of the patch in the scat 
of Steele's pants. And naturally 
Camilla's view of me too; not too 
unkind, I hope. She couldn't help 
the expression on her rigid little 
face, and I don't believe it ever 
meant anything. 

At the other end of the scale is 
the saved life of my angel's father. 
Recall can be a long process, she 
says, depending on the intricacy and 
richness*of the mind recalling; and 
■in all but the last stages it can be; 
halted at will. Her father's recall 
was begun when they were still far 



40 




 



out in space and he knew that he 
could not long survive the journey. 

When that journey ended, the 
recall had progressed so far' that 
very little actual memory remained 
to him of his life on that other 
planet. He had what must be called 
a deduct ive memory — f rom the. 
material of the years not yet given 
away, he could reconstruct what 
must have been, and I assume the 
other adult who survived the passage must have been able to shelter 
him from errors that loss of memory might involve. This, I infer, 
is why he could not show me a 
two-moon night. 

I forgot to ask her whether the 
images he did send me were from 
actual or deductive memory. Deductive, I think, for there was a 
certain dimness about them not 
present when my angel gives me a 
picture of something seen with her 
own eyes. 

Jade-green eyes, by the way. 
Were you wondering? 

In th e same f ash i on , m y own 
life could be saved. Every aspect of 
existence that I ever touched, that 
ever touched me, could be transmitted to some perfect record — the 
nature of the written record is beyond me, but I have no doubt of 
its relative perfection. Nothing important, good or bad, would be lost. 
And they need a knowledge of humanity, if they are to carry out 
whatever it is they have in mind. 

It would be difficult, she tells me, 
and sometimes painful. Most of the 



effort would be hers, but some of it 
would have to be mine. In her period of infantile education, she 
elected what we should call zoology 
as her life work; for that reason 
she was given intensive theoretical 
training in this technique. Right 
now I guess she knows more than 
anyone else on this planet not only 
about what makes a hen tick, but 
how it feels to be a hen. 

Though a beginner, she is in all 
essentials already an expert. She can 
help me, she thinks, if I choose this 
alternative. At any rate, she could 
ease me over the toughest spots, 
keep my courage from flagging. 

For it seems that this process of 
recall is painful to an advanced intellect — without condescension, she 
calls us very advanced — because, 
while all pretense and self-delusion 
are stripped away, there remains 
conscience, still functioning by 
whatever standards of good and 
bad the individual has developed 
in his lifetime. Our present knowledge of our own motives is such a 
pathetically small beginning! Hardly stronger than an infant's first 
effort to focus his eyes. 

I AM merely wondering how 
much of my life, if I choose 
this way, will seem to me altogether 
hideous. Certainly plenty of the 
"good deeds" which I still cherish 
in memory like so many well-behaved cherubs will turn up with 
the leering aspect of greed or petty 
vanity or worse. 



ANGEL'S EGG

Not that I am a bad man, in any 
reasonable sense of the term. I respect myself; no occasion to grovel 
and beat my chest. I'm not ashamed 
to stand comparison with any other 
fair sample of the species. But there 
you are: I atn human, and under 
the aspect of eternity so far, plus 
this afternoon's newspaper, that is 
a. rather serious thing. 

Without real knowledge, I think 
of this total recall as something, 
like a passage down a corridor of a 
tilyriad images, now dark, now brilliant, now pleasant, now horrible — 
guided by no certainty except an 
awareness of the open blind door 
at the end of it. It could have its 
pleasing moments and its consolations. I don't see how it could ever 
approximate the delight and satisfaction of living a few more years 
in this world with the angel lighting on my shoulder when she 
wishes, and talking to me. 

I had to ask her how great a 
value such 'a record would be to 
them. Obvious enough — they can 
be of little use to us, by their 
standards, until they understand us, 
and they came here to be of use to 
us as well as to themselves. And 
understanding us, to them, means 
knowing us inside out ■with a completeness such as our most dedicated and laborious scholars could 
never imagine. I remember, about 
those twelve million years: they 
will not touch us until they are 
certain no harm will come of it. 

On our tortured planet, however, 



there is a time factor. They know 
that well enough, of course . . . 

Recall cannot begin unless the 
■subject is willing or unresisting; to 
diem, that has to mean willing, for 
any being with intellect enough to 
make a considered choice. Now, I 
wonder how many they could find 
who would be honestly willing to 
make that uneasy journey into 
death, for no reward except an assurance that they were serving their 
own kind and the angels.
More to the point, I wonder if I 
would be able to achieve such willingness myself, even with her help. 

When this had been explained 
to me, she urged me again to make 
no hasty decision. And she pointed 
out to me what my thoughts were 
already groping at — why not both 
alternatives, within a reasonable 
limit of time? Why couldn't I have 
ten or fifteen years or more with 
her, and then undertake the total 
recall, perhaps not until my physical powers had started toward senility ? I thought that over. 

This morning I had almost decided to choose that most welcome 
and comfortable solution. Then my 
daily paper was delivered. Not that 
I needed any such reminder. 

IN THE afternoon I asked her if 
she knew whether, in the present 
state of human technology, it would 
be possible for our folly to actually 
destroy this planet. She did not 
know, for certain. Three of the 
other children have gone away to 



12 




 



different parts ot the world, to 
learn what they can about that. But 
sfee had to tell me that such a thing 
has happened before, elsewhere in 
the Universe. I guess I won't write 
a letter to the papers advancing an 
explanation for the occasional appearance of a nova among the 
stars. Doubtless others have hit on 
the same hypothesis without the aid 
of angels. 

And that is not all I must consider. 1 could die by accident or 
sudden disease before I had begun 
to give my life. 

Only now, at this very late moil": eat, rubbing my sweaty iorehead 
and gazing into the lights of that 
wonderful ring, have I been able 
to put together some obvious facts 
in the recjiured synthesis. 

I don't know, of course, what 
forms their assistance to us will 
take. I suspect human beings won't 
.see or hear much of the angels for 
a long time to come. Now and 
then disastrous decisions may be 
altered, and those who believe 
thcmsel ves wholly responsible 
won't realize why their minds 
worked that way. Here and there, 
maybe an influential mind will be 
rattier strangely nudged into a better course. Something like that. 
There may be new discoveries and 
inventions of kinds that will tend 
to neutralize the menace of our 
nastiest playthings. 

But whatever -the angels decide 
to do, the record and analysis of my 
fairly typical life will be an aid. Il 



could qven be the small weight deciding the balance between triumph 
and failure. That is Fact One. 

Two: my angel and her brothers 
and sisters, lor all their amazing 
level of advancement, are also of 
perishable protoplasm. Therefore, 
if this ball of mud becomes .1 ball 
of flame, they also will be destroyed. Even if they have the 
means to use their spaceship again 
or to build another, it might easily 
happen that they would not learn 
their danger in time to escape. And 
for all 1 know, this could be tomorrow. Or tonight. 

So there can no longer be any 
doubt as to my choice, anef I will 
tell her when she wakes. 

July 9 

TONIGHT- there is no recaUj 1 
am to rest a while. I see it is 
almost a month since I last wrote- in 
this journal. My total recall began 
three weeks ago, and already the 
first twenty-eight years of my life 
have been savc-d. 

It was a week after I told the 
angel my decision before she was 
prepared to start the recall. During 
that week she searched my present 
mind more closely than I should 
have imagined was possible : she 
had to be sure. 

*At this point Dr. Banncn-nim's handwriting alters curiously. From here on 
he used a soft pencil instead of a pen, 
and the script shct-ws signs of Haste. In 
spite of this, however, it is actually 
much clearer, steadier and easier to read 
than the earlier entries in his normal 
hand. — BLAJXli 



ANGEL'S EGG

During that week of hard questions, I dare SAT she learned more 
about my kind than has ever gone 
on record tve-n in a physician's 
office; I hope she did. To any psychiatrist who might question that, I 
offer a naturalists suggestion. It is 
easy to imagine, after some laborious time, that we have noticed 
everything a given patch of ground 
can show us. But alter the vicwpoi n t on ly a 1 i tt 1 e — d ig d own a 
foot with a spade, say, or climb a 
tree-branch and look downward — 
it's a whole new world. 

When the angel was not exploring me in this fashion, she took 
pains to* 'make me glimpse the satisfactions and million rewarding experiences I might have if I those 
the other way. I see how necessary 
that was; at the time it seemed almost cruel. She had to do it, for my 
own sake, and I am glad that I was 
somehow able to stand fast to my 
original choice. So was she, in the 
end; she has even said she loves me 
for it. What that troubling word 
means to her is not within my 
mind. I am satisfied to take it in the 
human sense. 

Since I no longer require normal 
sleep, the recall begins at night, as 
soon as the lights begin to go out 
in the village and there is little 
danger of interruption. Daytimes, I 
putter about in my usual fashion. I 
have sold Steele my hens, and 
Judy's life was saved a week ago. 
That practically winds up my affairs, except that I went to write a 



codicil to my will. I might as well 
do that now, right here in this 
journal, instead of bothering my 
lawyer. It should be legal. 

To Whom It May Concern: 
I hereby bequeath to my friend 
Lester Morse, M.D., of Augusta, Maine, the ring which 
will be found at my death on 
the fifth finger of my left 
hand. I would urge Dr. Morse 
to retain this ring in his private possession at all times, 
and to make provision for its 
disposal, in the event of his 
own death, to some person in 
whose character he places the 
utmost faith. 

(Signed) David Bannerman* 

Tonight she has gone away for a 
while, and I am to rest and do as I 
please till she returns. 1 shall spend 
the time tilling in some blanks in

Struct most of the story if it were 
worth the bother. This afternoon I 
grubbed around among some old 
letters of that period, but they 
weren't very interesting. * 

My knowledge of English is unaffected; I can still read scientific 
German and some French, because 
I had occasion to use those languages fairly often after I was 
twenty-eight. The scraps of Latin 
dating from high school are gone. 
So are algebra and all but the simplest proposition of high school 
geometry: I never needed them. 

I CAN remember thinking of my 
mother after twenty-eight, but I 
do not know whether the image this 
provides really resembles her. My 
father died when I was thirty-one, 
so I remember him as a sick old 
man, I believe I had a younger 
brother, but he must have died in 
childhood.* 

Judy's passing was tranquil — 
pleasant for her, I think. It took the 
better part of a day. We went out 
to an abandoned field I know, and 
she lay blinking in the sunshine 
with the angel sitting by her, while 
I dug a grave and then rambled off 
after wild raspberries. Toward evening the angel came and told me I 
could bury Judy — it was finished. 
And most interesting, she said. I 
don't see how there can have been 
anything distressing about it for 

*Dr. Barmen-nan's mother died in 19 IS 
of influenza. His brother (three years 
older, not younger) died of pneumonia,

Judy. After all, what hurts us worst 
is to have our favorite self-deceptions stripped away, and I don't 
think Judy had any. 

1 have not found the recall painful, at least not in retrospect. There 
must have been sharp moments, 
mercifully forgotten along with 
their causes, as if the process had 
gone on under anesthesia. Certainly 
there were plenty of incidents in 
my first twenty-eight years which I 
should not care to offer to the understanding of any but the angels. 
Quite often I must have been mean, 
selfish, base in any number of ways, 
if only to judge by the record since 
twenty-eight. Those old letters 
touch on a few of these things. To 
me, they now matter only as material for a record which is safely out 
of my hands. 

However, to any person I may 
have harmed, I wish to say this: 
you were hurt by aspects of my 
humanity which may not, in a few 
million years, be quite so common 
among us. Against these darker elements I struggled, in my human 
fashion, as you do yourselves. The 
effort is not wasted. 

One evening — I think it was 
June 12 — Lester dropped around 
for sherry and chess. Hadn't seen 
him in quite a while, and haven't 
since. There is a moderate polio 
scare this summer and it keeps him 
on the jump. 

The angel retired behind some 
books on an upper shelf — I'm 
afraid it was dusty — and had fun 



46 




 



with our chess. She had a /air view 
of your bald spot, Lester. Later she 
remarked that she liked your looks, 
but can't you do something about 
that weight ? She suggested an odd 
expedient, which I believe has occurred to your medical self from 
time to time — eating less. 

Maybe she shouldn't have done 
what she did with those chess 
games. Nothing more than my usual 
blundering happened until after my 
first ten moves; by that time 1 suppose she had absorbed the principles, and she took over. I was not 
fully aware of it until I saw you 
looking like a boiled duck. I had 
imagined my astonishing moves 
were the result of my own damn 
cleverness. 

SERIOUSLY, Lester, think back 
to that evening. You've played 
in stiff amateur tournaments; you 
know your own abilities and you 
know mine. Ask yourself whether I 
could have done anything like that 
without help. I tell you again I 
didn't study the game in the interval when you weren't here. I've 
never even had a chess book in the 
library, and if I had, no amount of 
study would take me into your 
class. I haven't that sort of mentality; just your humble sparring partner, and I've enjoyed it on that 
basis, as you might enjoy watching 
a prima donna surgeon pull off 
some miracle you wouldn't dream 
of attempting yourself. Even if 
your game had been away below 



par that evening, and I don't think 
it was, I could never have pinned 
your cars back three times running, 
without help. That evening you 
were a long way out of yonr class, 
that's all. 

I couldn't tell you anything about 
it at the time— she was clear on 
that point — so I could only bumble 
and preen myself and leave you 
mystified. But she wants me to 
write anything I choose in this 
journal, and somehow, Lester, I 
think you may find the next few 
decades pretty interesting. You're 
still young, some ten years younger 
than I. I think you'll see many 
things that I wish I might see come 
to pass — or I would so "wish if I 
were not convinced that my choice 
was the right one. 

Most of those new events will 
not be spectacular, I'd guess. Many 
of the turns to a better way will 
hardly be recognized at the time 
for what they are, by you or anyone 
else. Obviously, our nature being 
what it is, we shall not change 
overnight. To hope for that would 
he as absurd as it is to imagine 
that any formula, ideology, . theory 
of social pattern can bring us into 
Utopia. As I see it, Lester — and I 
think your consulting room would 
have told you the same even if your 
own intuition were not enough — 
there is only one battle of importance: Armageddon. And Armageddon field is within each individual. 

At the moment I believe I am 
the happiest man who ever lived. 



ANGEL'S EGG 



July 20 

ALL but the last ten years are 
now given away. The physical 
fatigue, though still pleasant, is 
quite overwhelming. I am not troubled by the weeds in my garden 
patch — -merely a different sort of 
flowers where I had planned something else. An hour ago she brought 
me the seed of a blown dandelion, 
to show me how lovely it was. I 
don't suppose I had ever noticed. I 
hope whoever Lakes over this place 
wiU bring it back to farming; they 
say the ten acres below the house 
used to be good potato land, nice 
early ground. 

It is delightful to sit in the sun, 
as if I were old. 

After thumbing over earlier entries in this journal, 1 see 1 have 
often felt quite bitter toward my 
own kind. I deduce that I must 
have been a lonely man, with much 
of the loneliness self-imposed. A 
great part of my bitterness must 
have been no more than one ugly 
by-product of a life spent too much 
apart. Some of it doubtless came 
from objective causes, yet I don"t 
believe I ever had more cause than 
any moderately intelligent man who 
would like to see his world a plcasantcr place than it has been. My 
angel tells me that the scar on my 
back is due to an injury received in 
some early stage of the war that 
still goes on. That could have 
soured me, perhaps. It's all right; 
it's in the record. 

She is racing with a humming


bird — holding back, I think, to give 
the Swift little green fluff a break. 

ANOTHER note for you, Lester. 
I have already indicated my 
ring is to be yours. I don't want to 
tell you what 1 have discovertd of 
its properties, for fear.it might not 
give you the same pleasure and interest that it has given me. Of 
course, like any spot of shifting 
light and color, it is an aid to selfhypnosis. It is more, much more 
than that, but — find out for your- ' 
self, at some time when you arc' a 
little protected from everyday distractions. 

I know it can't harm you, because I know its source. 

By the way, I wish you would 
convey to my publishers my request 
that they either discontinue printing 
my Introductory Biology or else 
bring out a new edition revised in 
accordance with some notes you 
will find in the top left drawer of 
my library desk. I glanced through* 
that book after my angel assured 
me that I wrote it, and I was 
amazed. However, I'm afraid my 
notes are messy— I call them mine 
by a poetic license — and they may 
be too advanced for the present 
day, though the revision is mainly 
a matter of leaving out certain generalities that aren't so. Use your 
best judgment. It's a very minor 
textbook, and the thing isn't tooi 
important. 

A last wriggle of my vanishing 
personal vanity.

July 27 

I HAVE seen a two-moon night. 
It was given to me by that remaining grown-up, at the end of a 
wonderful visit, when he and six of 
those nine other children came to 
see me. It was last night, I think — 
yes, must have been. First there was 
a murmur of wings above the 
house; my angel flew in laughing. 
Then they were here, all about me, 
full of gaiety and. colored fire, 
showing off in every way they knew 
would please me. Each one had 
something graceful and friendly to 
say to me. One brought me a moving image of the St. Lawrence seen 
at morning from half a mile up — 
clouds, eagles — now how could he 
know that would delight me so 
much? 

And each one thanked me for 
what I had done. 

But it's been so easy! 

And at <hc end the old one— his 
skin is quite black, and his down 
is white and gray — gave the remembered image of a two-moon 
night. He saw it some sixty years 
ago. 

I have not even considered making an effort to describe it. My fingers will not hold this pencil much 
longer tonight. Oh, soaring buildings of white and amber, untroubled countryside, silver on curling 
rivers, a glimpse of open sea. A 
moon rising in clarity, another setting in a wreath of cloud, between 
them a wide wandering of unfamiliar stars. Here and there the angels. 



worthy after fifty million years to 
live in such night. 

No, I cannot describe anything 
like that. But you human kindred 
of mine, I can do something better. 
I can tell you that this two-moon 
night, glorious as it was, WflS no 
more beautiful than a night under a 
single moon on this ancient and 
familiar Earth might be — if you 
will imagine that human evil has 
been cleared away, and that our 
own people have started at last on 
the greatest of all explorations, 
themselves. 

July 29 

NOTHING now remains to give 
away but the memory of the 
time that has passed since the angel 
came. I am to rest as long as I wish, 
write whatever I want. Then I shall 
get myself over to the bed and lie 
down as if for sleep. She tells me 
that I can keep my eyes open; she 
will dose them for me when I no 
longer see her. 

I remain convinced that our human case is hopeful. 1 feci sure that 
in only a few thousand years we 
may be able to perform some of the 
simpler preparatory tasks, such as 
casting out evil and loving our 
neighbors. And if that should prove 
to be so, who can doubt that in another few million years, or even 
less, wc might be only a little lower 
than the angels?

the Baimtrman journal is said to 
have been in the possession of Dr.

latter's disappearance in 1964, and 
that disappearance has remained an 
unsolved mystery to the present 
day. McCarran is known to have 
visited Capt. Garrison Blaine an 
October, 1951, but no record remains of that visit. Capt. Blaine 
appears to have been a bachelor 
who lived alone. He was killed in

written about nor discussed the 
Bannerman affair with anyone else. 
It is almost certain that he himself 
removed the extract and related 
papers from the files — unofficially, 
it would seem — when he severed 
his connection with the FBI in 
1957. At any rate, they were found 
among his effects after his assassination, and were released to the 
public, considerably later, by Mrs. 
McCarran.,

STATEMENT BY 
LESTER MORSE, M.D. 
DATED AUGUST 9, 1951 

On the afternoon of July 30, 
1951, acting on what I am obliged 
to describe as an unexpected impulse, I drove out to the country 
for the purpose of calling on my 
friend Dr. David Bannerman. I had 
not seen him nor had word from 
him since the evening of June 12 
of this year, 1951. 

AFTER knocking, calling to him 
and hearing no response, I 
went upstairs to his bedroom and 
found him dead. From superficial 
indications I judged that death 
must have taken place during the 
previous night. He was lying on 
his bed on his left side, comfortably 



50 




 



disposed as if for sleep, but fully 
dressed, with a fresh shirt and 
clean summer slacks. His 'eyes and 
niouih were closed, and there was 
no trace of the disorder to be expected at even the easiest death. 

BECAUSE of these signs I assumed, !»oon as I had determined the absence of breath and 
heartbeat and noted the chill of the 
body, that some neighbor must nave 
already found him, performed these 
simple rites of respect for him, and 
probably notified a local physician 
or other responsible person. I 
therefore waited, Dr. Banncrnian 
had no telephone, expecting that 
someone would soon call. 

Dr. Bannerman's journal was on 
a table near his bed, open to that 
page on which he had written a 
codicil to his will. I read that part. 
Later, while I was waiting for 
others to come, I read the remainder of the journal, as he apparently 
wished me to do. The ring he mentions was on the fifth ringer of his 
left hand, and it is now in my possession. 

When writing that codicil. Dr. 
Bannerman must have overlooked 
or forgotten the fact that in his formal will, written some months 
earlier, he had appointed me executor. If there are legal technicalities 
involved, I shall be pleased to cooperate fully with .the proper authorities. 

The ring, however, will remain 
in my keeping, since that was Dr. 



Bannerman's expressed wish, and I 
am not prepared to offer it for examination or discussion under any 
circumstances. 

The notes for a revision of one 
of his textbooks were in his desk, 
as indicated in the journal. They 
are by no means "messy," nor are 
they particularly revolutionary except in so far as he wished to rephrase, as theory or hypothesis, 
certain statements which I would 
liave regarded as axiomatic. This is 
not my field, and I am not competent to judge. I shall take up the 
matter with his publishers at the 
earliest opportunity.* 

So far as 1 can determine, and 
bearing in mind the results of the 
autopsy performed by Stephen 
Clyde, M.D., the death of Dr. 
David Bannerman was not incon 
sistcnt with the presence of an embolism of some type not distinguishable on post mortem. I have so 
stated on the certificate of death. 1 
am compelled to add one other 
item of medical opinion for what 
it may be worth: 

I am not a psychiatrist, but, owing to the demands of general practise, I have found it advisable to 
keep as up to date as possible with 
current findings and opinion in 
this branch of medicine. Dr. Bannerman possessed, in my opinion, 
emotional and intellectual stability

lie never did. No new edition of "Introductory Biology" was ever brought 
out, and the textbook has been out of 
print since 1952.

to a higher degree than anyone else 
of comparable intelligence in the 
entire field of iny acquaintance, personal and professional. 

IF IT is suggested that he was 
suffering from a hallucinatory 
psychosis, I can only say that it 
must have been of a type quite outside my experience and not described, so far as I know, anywhere 
in tlie literature of psych op athol
Dr. Banncrman's house, on the 
afternoon of July 30, was in good 
order. Near the open, unscreened 
window of his bedroom there was 
a coverless shoebox with a folded 
silk scarf in the bottom. I found no 
pillow such as Dr. Banncrman describes in the journal, but observed 



that a small section had been cut 
from the scarf. In this box, and 
near it, there was a peculiar fragrance, faint, aromatic, very sweet, . 
such as I have never encountered 
before and therefore cannot describe. 

It may or may not have any bearing on the case that, while I re-' 
mained in his house that afternoon, 
I felt no sense of grief or personal 
loss, although Dr. Bannerman had 
been a loved and honored friend 
for a number of years. I merely 
had, and have, a conviction that 
after the completion of some \uy 
great undertaking, he had found 
peace. 

The ring he bequeathed to me 
has confirmed that.

THE ILLUSTRATED MAN, by 
Ray Bradbury. Douhleday & Co., 
New York, N. Y., 1951. 252 
pages, $2.75. 

THIS is the cream off the top of 
the bottle. Besides writing some 
of the best short stories of any type 
being turned out in America today, 
Bradbury also (for which we may 
be particularly thankful) knows his 
own lemons and refuses to reprint 
them. As a result, we have an absolute must for every lover of science fiction, and also for those who 
want good short story writing, no 
matter what its genre. 

This is a better book than The 
Martian Chronicles, which, because of its limited subject, had a 



tendency to tire. The new volume, 
on the other hand, is as varied as a 
rainbow. Horror stories to chill the 
blood — has anything more frightening ever been written than "Kaleidoscope" or "The Fox and the 
Forest," or anything as bitter and 
sliuddery as "The Concrete Mixer?" 
Uncomfortable humor with a rapier 
twist, like "Marionettes, Inc." 
Trenchant stories with thoughtbombs built in like "The Other 
Foot," that very tough sccjucl to 
"Way in the Middle of the Air" in 
The Martian Chronicles, or Uke 
"The Fire Balloons," which you 
must read to believe! 

According to the record of copyright notices indicating previous 
magazine publication, some of the 



* * * A * SHELF 



53 



best of these stones have never before appeared in print. This is true 
of "The Other Foot," and of another chilling story of deep space 
called "No Particular Night or 
Morning." These originals alone 
would make the book a buy for 
anyone with a library budget. 

It is true that there are those 
who don't go for Bradbury. They 
won't like this book any better than 
anything else he has done, for it 
bears all the stigmata of his socalled "eccentricities." For most 
readers, however, this is in its favor 
- — for it means that here is someone 
whose prose is not die-cut like the 
styles of many of our modern crop 
of fiction writers, no matter what 
their subject. Bradbury is original, 
he is moving, he is colorful, he is 
rich in ideas. I don't know what 
else to ask of a writer of science 
fiction or anything else. 

THE SKYLARK OF SPACE, by 
Edward E. Smith, Ph.D. F.F.F. 
Publishers, Brooklyn, N. Y., 
1950. 245 pages, $3.00. 

THIS ancient item, on the title 
page of which auctorial credit 
is shared with Mrs. Lee Hawkins 
Garby (about whom I. for one, 
would like to know more), was the 
first venture of the greatest of all 
the old-time space opera boys, the 
creator of Space Hounds of the 
l.P.C, The Grey Lensman, and 
other equally famed and equally 
fancy derringdoes of the space 



lanes. The jacket blurb says The 
Skylark of Space was written before the first World War, though 
the earliest copyright date on the 
back of the- title page is t928. Further, according to this copyright 
page, the first book edition came 
out in 1946, the second in 1947, 
and the third (this one) in 1950. 
It seems that the early printings by 
another publisher were extremely 
small, so Julius Unger, who is hiding behind that "F.F.F.'' pseudonym, decided there still was a 
market for the book. 

This tale is the sort of thing that 
only insatiable fans will enjoy, being, unlike E.E.'s later opera, uncommonly amateur and awkward 
— an excellent example of the truism that an author's first work 
usually deserves the wastebasket 
more than it does publication. 
There is, it is true, some interesting pseudo-science, including stuff 
on atomic power which, if it was 
originally written as it now appears, 
came pretty close to some of the 
actual facts. 

But the Rover Boy style is just a 
little too ripe for these latter-day 
eyes, which have become accustomed to more genuine writing, 
and the rest of the pseudo-science 
is so much of the gee-whiz school 
that it hurts a little to read — like 
going through Sunday supplements. 
And, to continue the mixed metaphor, my ears are still red from the 
attempts at romance which Dr. 
Smith and his lady collaborator per


54 




 



petrated in this talc. The general 
level of the story can best be indicated, perhaps, by the fact that the 
strongest oath these manly characters ever indulge in is "Great Cat!" 

On the other hand, your honest 
reporter has to state that, despite 
all these cavils, he read the tale 
practically St a sitting (skipping 
ruthlessly, it must be added) since 
the plot docs move -and, for the 
last half of the book, all over the 
Galaxy, at that . . . Plenty of action, 
if you pass up the goo and forget 
all about literary techniques as 
you're reading. 

SOLUTION T-25, by Theodora 
Dubois. Do/tb/eday & Co., Neiv 
York, N. Y., 1951. 218 pages, 
$2.75. 

THIS is the first dip into science 
fiction by a lady who is credited with nearly twenty mystery 
stories. Somehow one could wish 
that she had stayed with her first 
love, for she doesn't do too well by 
us in this attempt. 

The story features an all-out 
atomic attack on the United States 
by the Russians, nearly complete 
destruction of all our cities, a callous and cruel dictatorship by the 
Communist masters, and their 
eventual defeat through the use of 
a mysterious new weapon, Solution 
T-2>. I will not tip the author's 
hand as to the nature of this solution — which is telegraphed from 
the earlier parts of the book — ex


cept to hint that something very 
much like it was used with a reverse 
twist by John D. MacDonald in 
Astounding less than a year ago. 

There is nothing particularly unsatisfactory about Miss DuBois' 
writing; it is as smooth and slick as 
soft butter. The idea of the United 
States being conquered by a sneak 
Communist attack is a usable one 
also, in view of the temper of today's thinking in -this country, although somehow science fiction 
seems to lose much of its zing when 
it is put to political use. But the 
characterizations, both of the Americans and the Russians, are so 
astonishingly crude, and the involutions of the plot are so completely 
unreal and coincidental, that the 
book becomes a job to finish. 

Miss DuBois' story inevitably 
forces comparison with the only 
other science fiction by a woman 
that Doubleday has published- — 
Judith Merhl's Shadow on the 
Hearth. This too was the story of 
an atom bombing, this time of New 
York alone, but what a difference! 
Miss Mcrril's book had no contrived plot, and the writing was 
not as slick as is Miss DuBois'. But 
her story was completely real, completely believable; it was peopled 
with painfully real and believable 
people. If I have to choose, I'll take 
good characterizations and a realistically rendered situation, and leave 
the melodrama and the buttery 
prose for others to read.

snapped the pipelines like — like 
pi pest cms." 

Vargas scrambled up and 
clutched the other man by the slack 
of his sunflower-colored robe. "Did 
they cut transmission?" he demanded. 

"Yes, but — " 

"How long before the flow 
stopped?" 

"About two seconds, chief. Possibly a little more. I didn't stop to 
get the meter readings — " 

"Don't interrupt me!" said Vargas in a restrained shout. He took 
a firmer grip and brought his popeyed face close to Choong. "Wbcit 
tr.is behig IrunsnjiJIeJ P" 

"Flangs," said the assistant in a 
barely audible voice. He gulped. 
"Tweed ledums. Collapsed flooring. 
Argo paste. Rozzcrs. And — and — " 

Vargas had been puffing heavily. 
Now he held his breath for an instant. "Well?" 

"And mangels," said Choong in 
terror. "Three pipes of mangels." 

Vargas collapsed on the floor and 
looked at Choong through his fingers. "Oh, Great Blodgett, no!" 

"Yes." 

"Mangels!" 

Bedlam was growing in the outer 
olfices. There were running footsteps, shouts, shrieks of dismay. 

"Tweed ledums arc bad enough.'* 
^said Vargas. "But mangels! We'll 
be excommunicated. They'll hang 
our totems upside down." 

A red-faced man appeared in the 
doorway. His expression was noi 


 



pleasant. Vargas scrambled to his 
feet and both he and Choong stood 
at attention. 

"Two and five-sevenths seconds," 
the red-faced man remarked. "Not 
& very good response for trained 
monitors, is it? Too much Rhinebeer the night before, perhaps? Or 
reading a tape— composing poetry ? 
Catching a little nap ? Or was 
it — ?" He stopped, wincing, and 
looked at a white-metal doughnut 
strapped to his right wrist, above 
his ruffled sleeve. A tiny voice spoke 
at some length; Vargas could only 
catch the words "jackass" and "cretin." 

"Yes, sir," said the red-faced 
man, whose name, for the record, 
was Wallace Hyacinth Manuel 
Chiang Llewellyn. He barked at 
Vargas, "Turn on the tri-D!" 

Vargas stumbled over to his desk 
and obeyed. A live foot disc set into 
a low platform on his right glowed 
faintly, sparked and then spat a 
vertical stream of color. The image 
steadied and became the all too convincing three-dimensional replica of 
a portly man with a bulbous nose 
and long gray hair. 

"Enlarge your image!" it said 
sharply. 

Vargas jumped a foot and tremblingly adjusted the controls on his 
desk. The portly man frowned at 
them and said, "I happen to be 
Representative John Hsi BrightFeather Wilson Woodcock, Chairman of the Committee to 
Investigate the San Juaquin Dis


aster, which was formed in emergency session five months ago. Now, 
arc you all of the scoundrels who 
Were immediately responsible for 
this outrageous dereliction of duty? 
If not, get the rest of 'em in here. 
We'll get to the bottom of this if 
it's the last — " 

THE Chief Executive, His Honor 
Ibrahim L. Btandu Eriksson 
Dickey, frowned an executive 
frown. "Now let me get this 
straight," he said. "The goods are 
put into one end of the tube and 
they arc turned into some kind of 
temporal flow?" 

"That's it approximately, Your 
Honor." Representative Rowland 
Mokai Dejonge Baruch Schemkov, 
Chairman of the Plenary Committee 
which had replaced Representative 
Woodcock's Emergency Committee 
( Woodcock having been impeached) glanced at a few notes 
in his palm. He had briefed himself thoroughly. 

" In transit, Your Honor, the 
goods are in a special state of 
matter, in which they are partially 
out of our frame of spacio-tcmporal 
reference, and are carried along by 
the universal drift, thus apparently 
bypassing the laws of inertia and 
conservation of energy. We apply 
no force once they enter the tube; 
that's why tube transport is so 
cheap. 

"Moreover, the size and shape of 
the goods to be transported make 
no difference, since the spacial co


DOMT LIVE IN THE PAST 



ordinates arc not fixed with reference to normal spate. You might 
say that the net result is the same 
as if you had melted everything 
down to a kind of thin mush. This, 
of course, is done before the shipment is fed into the pipelines. I 
would not insult Your Honor's intelligence by explaining the method 
by which the shipments arc moved 
out of our space-time, for it is too 
well known to need explaining. 

"There is just enough contact 
between the two matter states so 
that the material being transported 
will not go through a solid of any 
thickness. In other words, we can 
lead the shipments anywhere in the 
world through a tube, even a very 
small one — the tubes we use are 
three-eighths inches in width. At 
the end of the tube, the expansion 
of the material releases it from the 
special state and it comes out in 
its original form, ready to be 
processed, stored, consumed or 
whatever." 

"I see," commented the Chief. 
"That's all very well, Representative, but what I want to know is 
this. Just why were we caught with 
our robes up in this situation?" 

Schemkov cleared his throat. 
"There appears," he admitted, "to 
have been some theoretical possibility of this happening all along. 
I have several abstracts, which I 
will turn over to your office, of 
articles and scientific papers in 
which reference is made to the 
possibility. It — " 



THE Chief looked down his long 
nose in a manner which suggested that the Representative was 
not quite human. He said slowly 
and earnestly, "And this possibility 
was given no consideration when 
the transport tubes were built? Is 
that it?" 

Representative Schemkov had 
been a member of the Subcommittee 
to Pass on Recommendations for 
the Erection of Chang- Wiley Transport Tubes, and he quaked in his 
sandals. "No safeguard was possible, Your Honor. What occurred 
was that the rupture in the lines 
took place at exactly the instant 
when that section of the planet was 
revolving directly opposite the line 
of universal drift — an event which 
astronomers assure me is very rare 
— and, in addition, I understand 
that the temporal displacement at 
that moment was exceptionally 
great. Under these conditions, the 
material released from the end of 
the tube did not reform normally, 
but was carried some distance back 
along the temporal line — " 

"How far back? I mean exactly, 
not a guess." 

"The mathematicians are still 
working on that, Your Honor, and 
the best they can say now is that ii 
was probably somewhere between 
the mid-Twentieth Century and the 
late Twenty-First. However, there 
is a strong possibility that none of 
the material reached any enclosed 
space which would attract.it, and 
that it may all have been dissipated 



60 




 



harmlessly in the form of incongment molecules." 

"But those materials," said the 
Chief grimly, "included what?" 

"Flangs," said Representative 
Schcmkov, "and tweedlcdums, and 
collapsed flooring, and argo 
paste — " 

"And mangels" added the 
Chief. "Isn't that correct?" 

"Yes, Your Honor." 

"And you tell me that there is a 
possibility that these things did not 
suddenly appear in the homes and 
business places of persons of 
Blodgett' s own time — " he touched 
his forelock, and Schcmkov automatically did the same — "causing 
Blodgett knows how many neuroses, 
how many psychoses, how many 
lost contracts, how many broken 
homes — " 

"But, Your Honor — " 

"—and do you realize that if 
these things do appear in that era, 
the total course of our civilization 
might be altered? That we might 
today become a world of many 
warring nations instead of one? Of 
many races instead of one blended 
humanity? That the great naatl to 
whom we owe all this, Blodgett 
himself, might be — " he lowered 
his voice in horror — "destroyed by 
your carelessness? Do you realize 
that, Representative -'" 

Even the Chief was stunned by 
his own frightening suggestion, 
while Schemkov felt terror climbing his spine. 

"No Blodgett?" Schemkov whis


pered. "You're — you're just -saying 
that to scare me. It isn't — possible.'' 

The Chief's face was rigid with 
fear. "It is. Blodgett was the greatest of our Sacred Ancestors, but he 
was superhuman in a human way, 
not supernatural. With all thosje 
ghastly things loose in his era, and 
— and mangels, especially . . ." « 

"Destroying any of our other 
Sacred Ancestors would be unthinkable enough,'' said Schcmkov. "Bujt 
Blodgett himself—!" 

"This wonderful civilization he 
constructed entirely by the might of 
his incredible mind," the Chief 
added bitterly. "Gone." 

"I'd have myself ritually beheaded," said Schemkov, "rather than 
live in any civilization Blodgett did 
not create." 

"Representative, the men responsible for this catastrophe arc going 
to be sorry they were ever born into 
the public service. We're going to 
get to the bottom of this, and when 
we drj — " 

"TTERE'S what it boils down 
J. A t o," said the square man 
in the gray diamond-dusted robe 
with a non-objective dragon. He 
made a triangle with his hands on 
the desk-top. "The kick went all 
the way upstairs and now it's come 
all the way down again. Everybody 
in fifteen echelons has a sore tail, 
the blame has been passed around, 
and now you're it. That's all." 

Ronald Mao Jean-Jacques von 
Hochbein Mazurin wore a slightly 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



stunned expression on his normally 
cheerful, pug-nosed face. The face, 
up to now, had been his fortune; it 
bore a slight but perceptible resemblance to that of Blodgett, the 
Father of the World, as he appeared in early prints and paintings. 
Mazurin had learned to emphasize 
the resemblance by assuming a 
soulful I ook , once he d iscovered 
that it usually earned him the 
juicier and less messy jobs in the 
Bureau. 

He said, "Now wait a minute. 
How do they know they can get me 
to the right time line with this new 
gimmick of theirs? Isn't that a contradiction in terms? If I'm in it, 
that's a new line, isn't it? I 
mean — " 

"I know what you mean," said 
the square man. "Every displacement moves the observer to a new 
time line. But remember, you're not 
required to do anything once you 
get there; all you have to do is see 
what happened. As I understand it, 
you won't be attached to that time 
line at all; you'll just be partially 
in it, the same way stuff in a transport tube is partially in this line. 
You can't possibly affect anything 
that happens there. There-tore, from 
a mathematical point of view, 
you're not in it at all. You'll be 
able to see, because light quanta 
have binding extensions on either 
side of the plenum-line proper, but 
you can't influence anything that 
happens there." 

Mazurin was feeling uncomfort


able. "How do I get back?" 

"Don't worry," said the square 
man impatiently. "You'll get back 
all right. You'll be at the end of a 
pencil of temporal energy all the 
time. That's what will be holding 
you in the partly there state. After 
a few days, they'll send an impulse 
along it to bring you back. You'll 
have enough time to do the job 
properly, because if any of that 
stuff did come out where it would 
menace our Sacred Ancestors, it 
wouldn't have come out all at the 
same time or the same place. A 
difference of micro-seconds here 
could mean hours or days there." 

1 1HEN that's why nothing hap-L pened to our civilization yet," 
Mazurin said. "The things probably haven't landed." 

"It could be," the square man 
agreed worriedly. "Or it might not 
happen on this time line at all — 
the results of any change in the 
past could leave this one alone and 
affect only alternate futures." 

"Do you really think it might?" 
asked Mazurin hopefully. 

"No. Or maybe. How in hell 
would I know? All I'm supposed 
to discuss with you is sending you 
back to the past, to the time of 
Blodgett — " They touched their 
forelocks reverently — "At the end 
of a pencil of temporal energy, and 
that it'll bring you back okay in a 
few days." 

"Sounds like deep-sea diving at 
the end of a piece of string," said 



62 




 



Ma&uxin. "What happens if the 
power fails, or the contact is 
broken some other way?" 

"Then I suppose you'd be stuck 
in that line — which would, of 
course, immediately become another line. Not that it matters. But 
you wouldn't be too badly off if 
that did happen, I'd say. That was 
a pretty interesting period, not too 
Uncivilized, and you'd see a lot of 
action." 

"Umm," said Mazurin. He rapidly calculated his chances of 
getting another job if he were discharged and blacklisted by the ICS 
Intelligence Bureau— zero. "All 
right, I'm your boy." 

The square man came around 
the desk and patted his shoulder 
with a hand like a jeweled bunch 
of sausages. "Good man," he said 
emotionally. "I knew you'd comethrough, the Bureau knows how to 
pick 'em. Get your affairs wound 
Up and report to the Physics Bureau at twelve o'clock tomorrow." 

MAZURIN turned up in the 
white-tiled laboratory ten 
minutes late, with traces of lipstick 
still adhering to his right ear and 
exuding an enviable odor of good 
rice wine. In the interests of truth, 
it must be stated that he did not 
entirely absorb all the briefing hereceived before he was thrust unceremoniously into the temporal 
projection machine. 

He retained a definite impression ot the nun hine it self, which 



was of an unpleasant hollow -iube 
shape and emitted a disquieting 
hum, together with a sharp smell 
of ozone- He recollected that, once 
arrived at his destination, lie would 
be able to walk about on any available surface, but unable to move 
any solid object or enter into any 
sort of communication with the inhabitants. 

The breathing apparatus strapped 
over his mouth and nose was reminder enough that he was dc 
pendent upon his own air suj^ply. 
He recalled being asked it he bad 
been checked out in lip reading 
and Twentieth Century English, 
and oi replying, with hurt dignity, 
that he most certainly had. Then 
there was some more talk, during 
which he had been distracted by a 
tendency of his knees to swivel 
sharply, and then he had been 
grasped by the nape of the neck 
and his heels and slung into the 
machine. 

It was a Lyscnko-bcgotten silly 
business, altogether. He seemed to 
be sitting now on nothing in particular, in the middle of a bright 
blue sky with clouds in it, while 
an . obviously spurious landscape 
(flat, with antique square houses 
and a lot of palm trees, the whole 
being tilted at a forty-five degree 
angle) gently rose toward him. He 
watched this process with growing 
disapproval until the scene grew to 
full size and he bumped gently 
against a sidewalk which felt like 
sponge rubber. _ 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



He stood up and soared some 
twenty feet into the air, coming 
down in an approximately upright 
position. He looked around him. 
breathing heavily. His head was 
clearing, and he didn't like it. 
What had seemed Idle nonsense a 
few moments ago was now assuming the aspect of an incredible 
reality. The buildings around him 
were angular and massive, with an 
appalling quantity of extremely 
ugly embellishments in the way of 
glass bricks, chromium statues, 
walls of enormous windows. The 
people were all either walking or 



driving antique four-wheeled vehicles, and most of them were 
dressed in garments constructed on 
a curious cylinder principle, also 
with a great deal of angular detail 
work. 

This period, he recalled, had 
been addicted to what its denizens 
termed "the functional" in design. 
Not a curved line anywhere. 

Culturally, this was a dismal era, 
yet being in it gave Mazurin a holy 
thrill. There was practically no 
doubt about it— Blodgett himself 
was alive at this actual moment ! 

Directly in front of Mazurin, 





64 




 



the st rcet widened into a sort 
of village square, in the center of 
which a wooden platform was 
erected. A man in black stood on 
this platform, evidently making a 
speech to a small crowd assembled 
around him. Mazurin saw several 
instruments which were evidently 
crude vision cameras. He watched 
the speaker's lips, and made out a 
few phrases: "... the principles 
of loyalty and obedience to which 
we are all dedicated . . . one world, 
one people, one leader, one glorious 
ideal . . ." 

Interested, he walked closer. A 



gentleman approach ing the crowd 
on a tangential course strode into 
him before he had time to get out 
of the way, and Mazurin found 
himself violently propelled several 
yards away, to bounce from still 
another moving spectator and tome 
to rest finally sprawled on the pavement. 

He got up determinedly, soaring 
as before, and this time leaped 
scjuarely into the thick of the crowd 
before any other outriders could 
get at him. The crowd was closejucked, and he stood with very 
little difficulty on their heads. Now 




he was near enough to read, the 
speaker's lips easily, and he followed the speech with attention. 

THIS, our youngest but not 
least hallowed day, we must 
dedicate ourselves in our hearts to 
the eternal principles for which so 
many brave men and women died. 
For if wc do, those men and women 
are not ten years dead, but gloriously living in the eternal atmosphere 
of our truth. If we do this, the 
world did not end for them on that 
terrible day, August the seventeenth, nineteen eighty-one. The 
world will never end for them and 
for ourselves!" 

The speaker paused. "Citizens of 
the world, a salute to the heroes of 
the World State!" 

A man to the right of the speaker's platform, dressed in an exceedingly ugly green uniform, raised a 
brass instrument to his lips and 
blew mightily on it. Mazurin 
leaped nimbly as the citizens on 
whom he stood took off their hats 
and bowed their heads. The musician got through with whatever 
sounds he had been producing, and 
a row of similarly dressed men behind him raised antique rapid-fire 
rifles to their shoulders, aiming 
diagonally upward. 

Mazurin, directly in the line of 
fire, automatically threw himself 
flat, but he was still unused to his 
new condition and the motion sent 
him in a lazy parabola five feet 
over the crowd's heads. 

66 



Tin.' guns fired in unison, but a 
peculiar thing happened. From 
three-quarters of them leaped 
streaks of fire; from the other quarter issued something else entirely. 
At the end of each barrel, a dark 
blue bubble appeared. The bubbles 
swelled rapidly, more and more of 
them extruding, until they became 
ovoids three feet long and two feet 

wide, dotted with stumpy tentacles* 
Then they dropped out of Mazurin's vision, but he could judge their 
activity by the way the crowd 
scattered. 

Mazurin leaped nimbly and 
watched the square empty itself beneath him. The uniformed men 
broke ranks and fled, some dropping their guns. The crowd was 
spreading out as quickly as those 
in the center could force the others 
back. In the cleared space, the blue 
ovoids were leaping like f rogs, 
pausing and leaping again. At each 
pause, a toothless mouth gaped, and 
Mazurin could almost hear the bass 
"Urk!" they emitted. 

Nobody was left on the speaker's 
platform except the speaker himself, who had misjudged his vault 
over the railing and got himself 
tangled in the large black-and-red 
flag which draped it. While Mazurin watched, one of the blue 
ovoids bounded onto the speaker's 
back, settled down and began contentedly munching his jacket. 

As he floated down, Mazurin 
took a notebook from his pocket 
and wrote: Tweedledums: probably 


 



pineapple-flavored; very unripe and 
active; emerged without damper 
controls and broke up large religions gathering, j Tightening approx. 
500 persons. 

II 

MAZURIN sat alone in the sunwashed and empty square, 
letting the full enormity of the 
scene he had just witnessed seep 
into him. After a while he took out 
his notebook again and tried to calculate the probable number of surviving descendants, in his own 
world, of the five hundred people 
who had just been introduced to 
twecdledums. He had got up to 
five generations, and reached the 
utterly discouraging figure of 
20,420, when he gave up. 

He shuddered. He was not a devout man by nature, but he had had 
the usual training as a child, and 
the idea of so much as being disrespectful to ancestors — much less 
confronting them unexpectedly 
with a troop of tweedledufns!— 
made him cringe as if he had 
touched something unclean. 

And the other things had still 
to be accounted for: the rozzers, the 
collapsed flooring, the argo paste, 
the— 

No. It was better not to think of 
that. 

He got morosely to his feet and 
watched as the first of a long line 
of archaic ground -vehicles zoomed 
into the square and skidded to a 



stop. Green-uniformed men got out 
and ran off in all directions, till the 
square and the surrounding streets 
were covered with them. Presently 
a group of them came running 
back to the cars, carrying a tweedledum which was struggling furiously to escape. After a while they 
captured another one. 

/ hope they get them all, Mazurin thought; but he doubted that 
they would. Free of the projected 
energy that ordinarily kept them 
quiescent, a live tweedledum was 
the most active and elusive artificial food product ever invented. 
They had been one of Mazurin's 
favorite dishes; but he suspected 
now, with a sliding lurch in his 
stomach, that he would never, never 
eat one again. 

Something else seemed to be going on at the far side of the square. 
Resignedly, he propelled himself 
that way. A large knot of the greenuniformed men had collected near 
a doorway to one of the square 
buildings and was slowly moving 
back toward the cars. Mazurin 
leaped onto the heads of the crowd 
for a better view, and, approaching 
the center of the group, found that 
the quarry was not tweedledums 
this time, but people. A young man 
and a girl, to be exact. They were 
staggering along with their heads 
down , pushed and dr agged by 
many hands. As Mazurin watched, 
someone reached over someone 
else's arm and struck the girl in 
the face. 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



67 



MAZURIN'S first reaction was 
horror; his second was bewilderment. He saw now that what 
his superior had described as an 
"interesting" era could only be 
painful to any person of normal 
sensibilities; for all of these people, 
without exception, were ancestors 
in one sense or another! 

And why were these officials, 
who were possibly ancestors, maltreating two young possible ancestors in this manner, instead of 
running down twccdlcdums as they 
had evidently been sent to do? 
Could it be that the boy and the 
girl were suspected of being responsible for the catastrophe? 

It was absurd, but the only explanation he could think of. He 
followed, soaring over the rooftops, 
as the car containing the two 
zoomed off again. 

lie managed to keep in sight of 
the car, though it moved much 
too fast for him, and saw the two 
captives half -dragged, half -carried 
up the steps of a large, cubical 
black building. 

Once inside the building, however, he was lost in a maze of 
corridors full of hurrying, worricdlooking people. The place was three 
stories tall above the ground, and 
ten stories below, and there were 
hundreds of separate offices and 
Suites. It was not till a full hour 
liter that he found them, in a 
brilliantly lit cell facing a whitecnamcled corridor, in the lowest 
level of all. 



If it weren't for the bruises and 
cuts on their faces, Mazurin 
thought, they would have been a 
handsome couple. The boy was tall 
and lean, with a dark, thoughtful 
face; the girl was neatly rounded 
and had a charming head of almostplatinum hair. 

They were sitting side by side 
on a hard, narrow bench that ran 
from wall to wall of their five-byfivc cubicle. The harsh glare that 
illuminated them was hard on Mazurin's eyes; he put his polarized 
goggles on. They themselves had 
shut their eyes tight against the 
fierce light, and their heads were 
close together, their hands clasped. 

Mazurin watched their lips. The 
girl was saying, "We must be 
guilty, of course. I mean guilty of 
something." 

"Or they never would have 
arrested us," the young man finished after a pause. 

"Yes," said the girl. "They arc 
always right. AJwttyj. So we must 
be guilty. And yet it's hard to 
see — " 

"Hush, dear. It isn't for us to 
question what they do. Perhaps we 
have committed some crime without even being aware of it. Or 
maybe — " 

"Yes?" 

"Well, maybe they arc just testing us, or — or something." 

THE girl's eyes opened for a 
second. "Oh, Rob, do you suppose that's it?" 



68 




 



"It might be. Certainly wc didn't 
cause any disturbance at the patriotic meeting that wc know of." 

"But it's not for us to judge." 

"No." 

For some time, while he watched 
this conversation, Mazurin had been 
increasingly aware that the two 
young people were doing something 
rather odd. It had to do with their 
hands. He stopped watching their 
lips altogether and concentrated on 
the hands. 

They were clasped loosely together on the bench between the 
two, half covered by the drape of 
the girl's flowered skirt. Between 
the boy's palms and the girl's, Mazurin could see a constant flicker 
of motion, fingers flashing back and 
forth, first hers, then his. 

Now this, thought Mazurin, was 
extremely interesting. Beyond a 
doubt, the two prisoners were communicating by means of some ancient form of the finger-code he 
had learned as a raw cadet in the 
Internal Security Commission. If he 
could only get closer, he was almost 
sure, he could read it . . . 

Cadcnced footsteps came down 
the corridor. It was a white-robed 
attendant, flanked by two of the 
green-clad officials, each with a 
drawn missile gun. The attendant 
was carrying something in a white 
enamel tray, and in his other hand 
he had something that looked like 
the key to an old-fashioned mechanical lock. 

Clearly, they were going to open 



the young people's cell, to feed 
them, most probably. If he could 
slip in while they did it . . . Caution urged him back, curiosity drew 
him forward. There was no danger, 
he told himself. If the cell was 
opened once, it would be opened 
again, and he could get out. He 
made up his mind. 

The two guards stepped back, 
guns ready, as the attendant opened 
the door and stepped inside, depositing the tray — which did, indeed, contain food of some sort — 
on a shelf. As he stepped out again, 
Mazurin, lithe as a rozzer, squeezed 
in past him. Simultaneously, two 
things happened. 

The door shut with a clang. 

Mazurin topped to the metal 
floor under a totally unexpected 
access of weight. 

The two prisoners, the attendant, 
and the guard turned to stare at 
him with saucer eyes. 

WHILE he sat there, feeling as 
if someone had slugged him 
from behind, the three men outside exploded into activity. The 
attendant fled with hoarse cries 
down the corridor, and the two 
guards threw themselves flat, aiming their curious weapons at Mazurin. The two people in the cell 
with him, he was vaguely aware, 
had moved as far away as they 
could get and were sitting in 
stricken silence. 

Mazurin said weakly, "Kamerad. 
Tovarich. Ami." Then it occurred 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



to him that these men ■ spoke English and, anyway, they apparently 
didn't intend to shoot. Not as long 
as he didn't move, at any rate. He 
shut up and tried to think. What 
the Blodgctt had happened to him? 

The metal floor of the cell was 
hard and told under his palms. He 
was here, all right, and not on the 
end of any pencil of temporal 
energy. It had happened when the 
cell door shut behind him. 

He looked at the door. It was a 
grid of stout chrome-plated bars, 
with an interval between the bars 
of about three centimeters. A nonsense phrase came into his mind, 
"Eve and Agrid," which meant 
nothing. It wasn't Eve and Agrkl; 
it was Eve and Adam. Eve and 
Agrid. Eve and Agrid. Avcandagrid— 

Even a grid. 

Mazurin shut his eyes and 
g roan ed . He opened them again 
when one of the guards made a 
warning sort of noise, and stared 
miserably at the limited vista before him. "Above all," one of the 
technicians had said, "don't get 
yourself completely surrounded by 
metal, even a grid. It will break 
the temporal beam and you'll be 
marooned there ..." 

Marooned. Stuck with a lot of 
irrational people in a barbaric century. In a cell, at that. Under suspicious circumstances. 

He thought about it gloomily for 
a few minutes before, being a naturally cheerful young man, he tried 



to find the brighter side of it. Even 
then, the best he could do was, 
Weil, things ain't get any worse, 
and Blodgett himself is eilire right 
tit this moment. 

Running footsteps approached 
down the corridor, and a squadron 
of the green-uniformed men hove 
into view. Two of them had a 
thing on a wheeled tripod that 
looked as if it were capable of 
blowing out the side of a building. 
The rest spread out with drawn 
hand-guns. The two on the floor 
got up, saluted and joined the* 
semi-circle. 

"Stand ■ up !" said one who 
seemed to be in command. 

Mazurin obeyed with alacrity. 

"Remove that mask ! Put your 
hands behind your head! Face the 
wall!" 

When he had done all that, the 
cell Jour opened, someone took 
two swift strides inside, and then 
colored lights detonated inside 
Mazurin's head. 

He couldn't have been entirely 
out, because when he came to he 
was already thinking, Very cjjir/eni 
police methods. They didn't take 
any chances. Just the way an ISC 
man would hate handled it , . . 

HIS head ached abominably, and 
his hands and feet seemed 
swollen. Green- trousered legs were 
scissoring back and forth in front 
of his eyes, and the gray concrete 
floor was moving rapidly backward 
under him. He was, he realized.

trussed ii j> like a rozzer, be ini; 
dragged down the corridor. 

His head cleared a little and he 
glanced to either bide. The boy and 
the girl were in the party, in approximately the same condition as 
himself. 

They reached an elevator, and 
Mazurin got a view of its scuffed 
metal floor before they carried him 
out of it again. More corridor, 
black-tiled this time. Several turns. 
Then a doorway with an ebony sill, 
followed by flooring of some brown 
composition, probably a primitive 
pressed fiber. 

Finally he was set upright against 
a slender metal post and manacled 
there. The boy and girl were similarly disposed of to his right. 

A round man jn the green uniform stalked quickly in and stared 
at Mazu rin. His little blue eyes 
darted quickly from Mazurin's 
cloth-of-platinum robe to his face, 
then to the equipment hung at his 
belt. 

"All right," the round man said, 
"who arc you?"' 

Ma2urin opened his mouth, then 
shut it again. Tell the truth? Oh, 
no. 

His training as a law officer 
told him exactly what would 
happen to him if he did. But what 
lie could he invent that would save 
him the pain of being questioned? 
For he had no doubt that being 
questioned in this era would be 
painful, despite the rudimentary 
methods. 



The beat thing, he decided, was 
to say nothing. He tried it. 

The round man nodded decisively. "We'll see," he said. He turned 
as a set und and a third officer Strode 
in. All three stared at Mazurin, 
then turned and went to the far 
end of the room. Mazurin cc.ild 
read their lips easily. 

"*Wc knew they were cooking up 
something, but wc had no reports 
that even hinted at anything like 
this." 

"I don't like the smell of it. 
Why would they materialize him in 
that cell and then let us capture 
him? Better get him out of the city 
as fast as possible." 

The round man got in the way 
at that point and Mazurin missed 
sonic of it. Then all of them turned 
to come back, and he caught one 
more sentence: "Put them all in one 
cell, and we may learn something." 

The three of them were detached from the pillars, efficiently 
trussed up again, and hurried outside to the waiting maw of a long 
black paddy-wagon. 

IT WAS a long ride and an uncomfortable one. Not being able 
to talk under the eyes of t heguards, Mazurin had plenty of time 
to think, and, by the time half an 
hour had gone by, he was shoulderdeep in gloom. 

He was roused out of himself 
when the car suddenly leaped six 
inches off the road, came down and 
leaped again. Looking back through 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



71 



the barred window, Mazurin could 
see that they had left the smooth 

concrete highway and were rushing 
down a cowpafh of some kind. He 
and the two young people, all with 
their wrists manacled around a 
horizontal bar, bounced like popcorn. The two guards crooked their 
free arms around stanchions. 

Glancing down, Mazurin noted 
that the two kids were at it again 
with the fingers. He looked away 
miserably, then peeked back. It was 
his damned curiosity that had put 
him there; he might as well satisfy 
it while he could — if he could. 

THE code was the same, all right: 
five standard positions for each 
of the five fingers gave you twentyfive letters, and a clenched fist was 
"X" if you needed it. After a moment, he could read what the boy 
was saying without difficulty. 

'\ . . in my shoe. If they give 
me a chance . . ." 

"Charlie, I'm scared!" 
"Only way. They'll get it all out 
of us otherwise. They know how 
to. Would have done it before now 
if he hadn't turned up." 
"Think he's one of ours?" 
"Can't be; we haven't anything 
like that. Don't understand it, but 
can't take any chances. He might 
be a spy." 

They meant bim, Mazurin surmised. An interesting century, indeed. 

The girl again: "Okay. I guess 
it's worth it." 



It occurred to Mazurin. with an 
ineffable shock, that it must be 
poison Charlie had in his shoe, of 
all unsanitary places . . . They 
were going to kill themselves, to 
keep the authorities from patting 
them to question. Evidently, either 
a large and fanatical fraternal society, or else a revolutionary group; 
all kinds of secrets. But he couldn't 
let them commit suicide ! Such a 
thing would be an ineradicable blot 
on the totems of their thousands 
of descendants. Even worse, he 
didn't know their surnames; they 
might be his own great-great -greatgreat grandparents. 

Worst of all, he suddenly realized, their suicide might blot more 
than totems — himself, for example, 
right out of existence! 

He could alert the guards, of 
course, but the more he thought 
about that, the less he liked it. 
Questioning, this far back in history, would be sure not to be subtle. 
From one point of view it was perfectly sensible of them to prefer 
poi son . Bum pt If only the car 
would stop bouncing for a minute 
so he could think . . . 

The car abruptly outdid itself. 
Mazurin found himself whirling 
around the horizontal bar like a 
demented acrobat, while two green 
blurs that were the guards soared 
airily to the forward end of the 
compartment. Something struck Mazurin a dizzying blow on the head, 
the car bounced twice more and 
came to rest, while the echoes of a 



72 




 



thunderous explosion died away in 
his ears. 

Ill 

THE car was canted, half in a 
ditch. The guards, piled up 
against the forward wall, were not 
moving. Charlie and the girl were 
half stunned but conscious. Mazurin pulled futilely at his wristcuffs; they were too tight even for 
his trained hands to slip. 

Acrid fumes drifted into the car 
through a burst seam in the rear. 
Mazurin sniffed, and felt a cold 
dew break out on his forehead. 

"Oh, what is it?" asked the girl 
faintly, 

"Argo paste," said Mazurin, jittering. "It must have started coming out of the exhaust or the jet 
tube — whatever these vehicles use. 
Oh, sacred name . . ." 

"What's argo paste?" demanded 
the youth groggily. "I never heard 
of the stuff." 

"I know you haven't," Mazurin 
said. He groaned. "They use it to 
burn through metal. It's supposed 
to come out into glazed vats. If only 
it's stopped — " 

The fumes grew thicker. Mazurin 
looked out the barred rear window. 

"We're in a 'pool of it," he said. 
He turned. "Can you reach those 
two?" he asked the boy, nodding 
toward the two unconscious guards. 

The boy shook his head. "They 
haven't got our keys, anyhow. The 
guard up front with the driver has 



them. And he's knocked out, or 
he'd have been back here by now." 

The car lurched and settled. A 
section of the floor began smoking 
and dripped away, leaving a puckered gap through which ihey could 
see a slowly heaving pool of gray 
paste. 

"Can you get your shoe off?" 
Mazurin asked suddenly. 

Charlie gave him a look full of 
suspicion. 

"Your shoe," Mazurin repeated 
with agonized patience. "Either one, 
it doesn't matter." He slipped his 
left foot out of his own elastictopped sandal, grasped it between 
his toes and held it up. "Mine's 
no good, you sec? Too thin. Yours 
is made of thick leather. Can you 
take it off?" 

"I don't get it," said Charlie, 
baffled. A heavier drift of choking 
fog came up through the vanishing 
floor. "Hut — " He grunted, raising 
and twisting his leg until his manacled hands could reach the laces. 
"Here." He dropped the shoe and 
kicked it along to Mazurin. 

The car settled again. The pool 
of gray slime was now only a foot 
below them. Mazurin grasped the 
shoe with his toes, shifting his grip 
till it was as firm as he could manage. Then he held on like glUM 
death and lowered the shoe 
through the gap in the floor, into 
the gray pool un derneath. He 
brought it up quickly. 

There was a good gob of the 
stuff in the heel end of the shoe, 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



73 



about two inches from his own 
bare foot, but it was smoking 
furiously. In another second, the 
leather would be eaten through. 

He brought the shoe up, under 
the horizontal bar, over it again — 
and dumped the paste on the bar 
just as the leather gave way. The 
metal smoked acridly and melted. 

Mazurin jettisoned the shoe, 
jammed his foot back into his own 
sandal, and peered at the bar 
through watering eyes. There was 
a hearty bite out of it, but a slender 
tongue of metal still united the two 
sections. 

"Now!'' said Mazurin. "Pull!" 

He braced his back and shoved 
at the bar till his muscles cracked, 
while Charlie, his face white with 
strain, pulled from his side. The 
car lurched once more, and the 
gray surface beneath leaped up to 
the level of the floorboards. Mazurin got his feet up on the bar 
and gave one last desperate shove. 
The metal gave a f>i"g and moved 
a fraction of an inch. Through the 
smoke, Mazurin saw that the 
narrow part had snapped. He 
pushed some more, until the bar 
reluctantly bent a full three inches 
out of its original line. 

KNEELING on the bench, Mazurin held his wrists carefully 
away from the smouldering ends of 
the bar and slipped his arms free. 

"Nice work so far," said Charlie, 
"but what about the door?" 

He slid down to the end of the 



bench and moved his own arms 
free of the bar. The car tilted again 
as the girl moved to follow him. 

"Get back!" said Mazurin urgently. He motioned Charlie to the 
forward end of the car. "Balance 
the weight while she gets loose." 
He looked at the door that still 
barred their way to freedom. The 
lock, naturally, was about halfway 
up, better than two feet from the 
level of the argo paste. "Other 
shoe," he told Charlie. "Can't be 
helped." 

Charlie took it off and handed 
it down to him. The girl had got 
her arms free now and was leaning 
forward with the wristcuffs spread, 
evidently intending to touch the 
connecting piece to the smoking 
end of the bar. 

"No !" yelled Mazurin, and she 
started back. "Horrible stuff — get a 
drop of it on your flesh, no way 
to stop it. Get back with Charlie, 
please." 

Squatting on the bench, he leaned 
forward precariously and dipped 
the second shoe into the seething 
gray mass. He got a bigger quantity this time, and he could control 
it better. He brought It up swiftly 
and caref ully pou red it over the 
lock, peering through the haze to 
make sure he had the right place. 

Smoke gushed out, and he 
couldn't sec what was happening; 
but he pushed the door outward, 
and it gave. He stood up, put one 
foot on the opposite bench, and 
got the other wedged into the 



74 



&ALAXY science fiction 



barred opening of the door. A push 
and a twist, and he was precariously balanced outside, directly over 
the center of the viscous, smoking 
pool. 

The car settled again under his 
weight. He scrambled to get both 
feet on top of the door, lunged and 
sprawled across the smooth top of 
the car. Panting, he got his feet 
under him again and flung himself 
forward, feeling the car tilt slightly 
under him as he moved. 

"All right," he called, "come out 
quickly!" 

He saw a motion beneath him, 
and turned as the door of the cab 
opened and a head thrust itself out. 
The head shook itself, dazedly. Mazurin, flat on his stomach, leaned 
out and slammed his manacled 
wrists apologetically under the 
man's ear. 

"Sorry, Sacred Ancestor," he 
said regretfully. "One must take 
sides, it would seem." 

THE guard dived slowly and 
gracefully out of the open 
door and sprawled on the grass outside. Mazurin, overbalanced by the 
blow, felt himself slipping, grabbed 
for a hand-hold, then let himself 
go. He landed on his shoulders, 
rolled quickly and stood up, poised 
to leap into the cab. But the second 
uniformed man was still hunched 
over with his flattened face pressed 
against the windshield. A trickle of 
blood trailed from his ear. 

Mazurin looked up as Charlie 



appeared on top of the car, followed by the girl. "All secure 
here," he said. "You two all 
right?" 

"We're just fine," said Charlie 
grimly, "and we're certainly grateful to you for saving our lives. But 
would you mind giving us a hint 
of what this is all about?" He and 
the girl jumped down beside Mazurin, and Charlie gestured toward 
the dwindling rear end of the car. 
"Argo paste," he said. "And those 
things back in Welfare Square." 

"Tweedledums," Mazurin supplied helpfully. "Pineapple-flavored, I think." 

"Tweedledums," repeated the 
boy. "And you. What are you, the 
Mad Hatter? If so, what are you 
going to pull out of your hat next ?" 

"There's lots more," Mazurin 
said gloomily. "We haven't seen 
the flangs yet, or the collapsed 
flooring, or the rozzers, or — " 

"Wait a minute," Charlie interrupted. "Just one minute. One 
thing at a time. What are flangs?" 

Mazurin searched his mind for 
the archaic word. Castards ? Something like that. Ces, cis, cos — "Custards," he said. "From the French 
flm. although I believe there was 
some influence dating from the 
Early Hollywood Era. They're mobile, but not as much as the tweedledums. They only creep around, 
and they like to crawl into any dark 
enclosed space they find. So you 
just leave them with a bunch of 
open pastry shells, and — " 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



75 



Charlie interrupted again, "All 
right, I knew it was going to be 
something like that. I won't ask 
you what rozzers are." 

"Like a very slender pig," said 
Mazurin promptly. "Fast as lightning. Some people like to race 
them." 

"And eat them." 

"Eat rozzers?" Mazurin exclaimed in disgust. "We'd sooner 
starve !" 

CHARLIE looked at him, breathing heavily. "All I want to 
know," he said, "is where all these 
things that nobody ever heard of 
tame from, and that includes you." 

"Well, I'll tell you," said Mazurin reluctantly, "but I have a 
feeling you won't believe me." 

He squatted and began going 
through the pockets of the guard 
who lay on the greensward at their 
feet. 

"No," said Charlie, and gave 
him a push that sent him sprawling. Charlie knelt quickly and removed the guard's hand-gun from 
its holster. Backing up, he handed 
the gun to the girl and then went 
back to the guard. "Sorry, but I 
don't see how we can trust you." 

He found the guard's keys, stood 
up and held the gun trained on 
Mazurin while the girl unlocked 
his wristcuffs; then they traded 
while he unlocked hers. It seemed, 
Mazurin thought ruefully, that they 
had no present intention of unlocking his. 

76 



"Can I get up now?" he asked 
* mildly. 

"Yes, - * said Charlie. He gestured 
with the gun to their left, across 
an open field that ended at a wooded ridge. "We've got to get under 
cover." He glanced at the gun in 
his hand, then back at the smoking 
rear of the paddy-wagon. "What 
do you think, Eve?" 

"It would be nice to have it," 
the girl said regretfully, "but it's 
sure tipoif." 

"Right," said Charlie, and he 
returned the gun to the guard"s 
holster. Then he pulled the keys 
out of his pocket and replaced them 
as well. 

"Hey," objected Mazurin, "when 
do I get out of these things?" 

"Later — -maybe," said Charlie. 
"By the time anybody finds the 
car, there's a good chance that the 
whole rear end will be gone, and 
they'll figure we went with it. But 
not if wc take anything from this 

e u y-" 

"They'll die if we leave them 
unconscious in this pool of argo 
paste !" Mazurin said, horrified. 

"What of it?" Charlie wanted to 
know. "You don't think they'd let 
us live long, do you?" 

Mazurin paused. "They wouldn't?" 

"Certainly not," said Eve. 
"That's how they stay in power — 
kill off the opposition." 

"But I'm not the opposition," 
Mazurin denied. 

"Oh, no?" Charlie demanded 



77 



threateningly, and Mazurin decided 
abruptly that he was. Charlie said, 
"You don't know how close you 
came to joining these stinkers." 

Eve started walking- "Let's go. 
Someone may come along and ask 
why we're not helping our gallant 
lads out of danger." 

THEY headed across the field, 
Mazurin in the lead. He felt 
a little sick. In his own time, he 
tried to tell himself, he'd seen men 
killed often enough for exactly 
similar reasons. But this wasn't his 
own time; this time he belonged 
to his Sacred Ancestors, some of 
them were being left to die in argo 
paste. He felt a wave of resentment against the two youngsters 
behind him, and then recoiled 
from that, too. They could be his 
ancestors. Now just what in the 
name of Blodgett could a man do 
in a situation like this? 

They pushed through a tangle of 
saplings and undergrowth for what 
seemed like several hours, until 
they reached a little stream. ; Eve 
sat down, gasping, and the other 
two followed suit. 

"It's getting too late to eo much 
farther, anyway," said Charlie. He 
inspected his shoeless feet glumly, 
then turned to Mazurin. "All 
right," he said, "let's have your 
story, improbable or not." 

Mazurin told them, from the beginning. They listened in discouraging silence. Finally, "Is that 
all ?" Charlie asked. 



"That's all," said Mazurin 
"What happens next / don't know, 
except that we'll probably run into 
the rozzers committing a nuisance 
in City Hall, or somebody triggering a section of collapsed flooring 
and getting knocked into the next 
canton, or — " 

"What makes you think you're 
going lo see any city hall?" asked 
Charlie ominously. 

"No reason, except that defiling 
a public building is one of the few 
supreme- crimes I haven't been responsible i or yet. " 

"How's (hat again?" said 
Charlie, confused , 

"Don't you remember what he 
said aboi it an c es tor wo rsh i p ? " 
asked Eve. "It makes sense. He 
feels directly responsible for all 
these tilings that have been happening to people who, for a! I he 
knows, may be his own ancestors." 
She frowned at Mazurin, opened 
her mouth to speak again. 
"How—" 

"Now wait a minute," Charlie 
burst out. "You're not assuming 
that he's telling the truth, are 
you ? ' ' 

"You wait," she told him. Then, 
to Mazurin, "See if I've got this 
right. You come from about four 
centuries from now, and in your 
time the World State is an established lact. There never was any 
successful attempt to overthrow it. 
Is that right?" 

Mazurin nodded. 

Charlie snorted. "Well, if wc 



78 




 



fell for thai, we'd simply knuckle 
under and let Blodgett's hoodlums 
have it all their own way." 

"Hoodlums ?" Mazurin echoed, 
touching his forelock. "Our most 
Sacred of Ancestors!" 

Charlie peered at Mazurin 
puzzledly. "Is that what you're for, 
to convince \is we can't win? It 
seems a little too simple-minded 
to deserve all this buildup." 

MAZURIN shook his head. 
' 'You don' t quite un derstand," he said. "This is a different 
time-line from the one I came from. 
It's different because I'm in it, 
here. Anything can happen now." 

Charlie looked more baffled than 
ever. 

"Listen," said Eve, "just suppose he is telling the plain truth. 
And as you said a minute ago, if 
the Worstas had all that new stuff 
— materializing him in our cell, and 
those green things in the Square — 
why would they waste it on a silly 
trick like this?" 

"All right," said Charlie. "What 
then ?" 

"Then he might be able to help 
us win," said Eve. 

"Just for the theoretical interest 
of it — suppose you could help us 
overthrow the Worstas, Mazurin, 
would you do it?" 

"The who?" 

"The Worstas— the World Staters. Blodgett and his gang. You've 
seen the kind of tyrannical crew 
they are. All right, would you help 



us if you could?" 

"Well, no," said Mazurin honestly. 

"Why not?" 

"Because, for one thing, if I 
help you I hurt them, and vice 
versa. I couldn't help either side. 
It would be irreligious." 

Charlie stared at him contemptuously, and Mazurin felt his 
ears getting red . It did sound 
stuffy, at that. Why couldn't they 
have let him stay in his own environment, where a man could take 
his religion on sacred days and 
forget about it the rest of the 
time ? 

"There's another good reason," 
he said defensively. "You seem to 
forget that I come from the world 
that grew out of this one. Well, 
it's a pretty good world. It's peaceful; there hasn't been a war in 
more than three centuries. Nobody 
has to work hard, as a general rule. 
No more race or nationality problems — everybody's interbred so 
much, as a result of the lowering 
of national barriers, that" there's 
only one kind of people. Why 
should I want to change all that?" 

"No reason, maybe, ' ' said the 
girl, "but you can see why we want 
to change our world, can't you?" 

Mazurin thought about it. "No. 
It would change the fine world of 
my time — the world that Blodgett—" 

He touched his forelock — 
"created by the might of his giant 
intellect." 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST

"Well, look,'" said the girl. "Ten 
years ago there was a world war, 
the ninth in sixty years. There was 
a worldwide organization that was 
righting the war, had been righting 
against war since about nineteen* 
sixty. They had a lot of followers, 
nil piper, but they weren't strong 
enough to do anything until the 
people finally got fed up. After 
all, it had got to the point where 
you'd have two or three months 
of peace after the armistice was 
signed, and then the whole bloody 
mess would start all over again. 

"CIVILIZATION was going 
VJ straight downhill. That had 
been happening lor a long time, 
but now it was happening so fast 
that you could see it happening. 
There was a spontaneous wave of 
revolt all through South America, 
where the fighting was going on at 
thai time. It started with a French 
regiment that turned around and 
shot its officers. Then the Canadian 
regiment they were fighting did the 
same thing, and after that it spread 
too fast to figure out how the idea 
got around. 

"All the armies in Soutli America 
sent delegates to a conference — -the 
conference of Acapulco — and the 
Worstas put over their program. 
Then all the armies went home, 
kicked out their governments, held 
general elections, and ten months 
later we had the World State." 

"Well," said MazurJn, "what's 
wrong with — " 

80 



"Wait. For five months everything went fine. All the important 
nations were in, and it was a surething that the others — the ones 
that hadn't been in this particular 
fighting -would come in later. We 
had a swell Constitution and wc 
were disarming like fury. Then 
there was a (oup d'etat. Blodgett 
and his gang moved in, kidnaped 
Provisional President Carres, 
drugged him and made him sign 
orders appointing Blodgett's gang ' 
to key positions. 

"It was logical enough; blodgett 
himself was the number two man 
in the Worstas movement to begin 
with. By the time anybodv found 
out what was going on, they were 
so firmly entrenched that they've 
been able to stamp out every rising 
against them ever since. They've 
got the best propaganda line since 
Stalin, and the people as a wholewon' t move because there's peace, 
and they're sick of war. So all 
we've wound up with is just another damned dictatorship. Now 
do you see?" 

"Wait a minute," said Mazurin. 
He had been listening with growing horror to Eve's use of the 
Sacred Name. "This Blodgett 
you' re talk i ng abou t — t h a t can ' t 
possibly be Ernest Elwood Vernon 
Crawford Blodgett, can it?" 4 

"His name is Ernest, and his 
mother's name was Crawford," said 
Eve. "Where you got those other 
handles from, 1 don't know." 
"It's the way wc name our

 



selves," Mazurin explained. "Your 
own given name, given names of 
two prominent ancestors, one from 
each line, then mother's and father's 
line names. Anyway, if that's the 
Blodgctt y&u're talking about, you 
must have your facts all wrong. 
Blodgctt — " he touched his forelock — " was the founder and first 
President of the World State. Kids 
learn about him in the first course. 
The Father of the World and so 
forth. He wasn't any dictator and 
there wasn't any president before 
him." 

"Blodgett is busy revising the 
histories right now," said Eve grimly. "I'll bet the big ham hasn't got 
buck teeth in the pictures you've 
seen, either." 

"Of course not," said Mazurin. 
"Have you ever seen him in person?" He demanded. 

Eve reddened. "No. But I've seen 
smuggled pictures of him before he 
got his dentures — " 

"Then," said Mazurin triumphantly, "how do you know the pictures you saw weren't faked?" 

They kept it up for another hour, 
ruffling tempers all around, until 
Charlie told them both to pipe 
down and get some sleep. 

IV 

MAZURIN awoke feeling as if 
he had spent the night hanging by his thumbs. His hands were 
completely numb, and the rest of 
his body was so stiff and painful 



that it took him ten minutes to 
stand up. 

The other two had made out a 
little better, but they were all cold, 
hungry and short-tempered. They 
drank water from the stream, ate 
some wild berries they found after 
an hour's search, stuffed leaves into 
Charlie's socks, and then started oft 
again through the woods. Charlie, 
when Mazurin asked him where 
they were going, politely requested, 
him to keep his geographically described questions to his precisely 
defined self. 

An hour or so later, when the 
Suii was higher and exercise had 
loosened their muscles, they were 
feeling a little better. They had 
struck a path of sorts under sonic 
kind of fragrant trees that were 
unfamiliar to Mazurin. The 
branches made a comfortable pattern against the deep-blue sky, and 
there were birds calling pleasantries 
. back and forth. Mazurin moved upbeside Eve and walked with her for 
a while in silence. 

"I suppose I was kidding myscli 
last night when I thought you might 
be able to help us," she said 
finally. "We've got a fair chance 
as it is, but it's awfully risky. It 
would be nice to know that the 
Marines were going to ride up at 
the last moment." 

Mazurin made sympathetic 
noises, feeling a little embar* 
rasscd. 

"How do you feel about being 
cut off from your own time?" she 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



81 



asked suddenly. "You're in a pretty 
tough spot, too." 

Mazurin realized that he hadn't 
had time to wonder how he did 
feel about it. He imagined the 
technicians back at the Physics Bureau searching through the timelines, finding him by some 
improbable chance, and yanking 
him back. He had a clear vision of 
the expression on the face of his 
square-jawed superior when that 
worthy read his report. 

He shuddered. 

"What's the matter * 
"If I got back now,'' said Ma2urin, "they'd give me one year 
in the Black House and then turn 
my totem upside down and demote 
me to the Cleanliness Inspection 
Squad." 

"Why ? Because your mission 
wasn't successful?" 

"Well, that isn't exactly the way 
my chief would put it. He'd say I 
w.ts .i disgusting ghoul with the 
moral fiber of a cuckoo, who would 
pick his teeth with a splinter from 
his uncle's coffin." 

"But you did all you could, 
didn't you?" 

Mazurin conscientiously reviewed 
his activities of the day before. "I 
guess I did, but that doesn't matter. 
They go by results." 

"H'm," said Eve. "So does Buck 
tooth Blodgett. How did you 
happen to go to work for the — 
what is it ?" 

"Internal Security Commission," 
said Mazurin. 



."It would be'. Fancy name for 
secret police, isn't it? Well, how 
did you happen to join up?" 

"Why," said Mazurin in astonishment, "I was selected. When I 
was fifteen. Those decisions can't 
be left to individuals." 

She stopped and stared at him, 
wide-eyed. "And you think that's 
the best of all possible worlds ? 
Even Blodgett hasn't pulled anything quite as rank as that yet. But 
he will, I can see." 

She moved on, and Mazurin 
followed her, puzzled. "How else 
would you do it?" he inquired. 

"Free choice," she said curtly. 
"Government docs its best to provide equal opportunities for everybody, and you choose what you 
want to be." 

"Ah," said Mazurin shrewdly, 
having swiftly found the illogicality, "but who would want to go 
into the ISC?" 

"Yes," she agreed, "who ?" 

Mazurin mulled that over for a 
while. 

"It wouldn't work," ne said 
finally. "You could never get people to agree to it, in my time. It 
goes directly contrary to the teachings of our ancestors." 
"Exactly," she saidHalf an hour later, Mazurin was 
still thinking about the implications 
of that remark. 

THEY stopped when they got to 
another small stream that 
Charlie and Eve seemed to recog


82 




 



nize. Charlie washed his face and 
hands, swore because be had no 
razor, and looked suspiciously .it 
Mazurin's pinkly beardless chin. 

"Depilatory cream," Mazurin 
told him. "Stuns the follicles for a 
month. Invented about 2050, I 
think." 

Charlie grunted, but looked halfconvinced. 

"Let me have those sandals," he 
said. He put them on and climbed 
along to the top of the next ridge. 
He looked cautiously over, then 
waved (o Eve and disappeared over 
the top. 

"What now?" asked Mazurin. 

"We wait here," said Eve shortly. "There's a town up ahead where 
one of our contacts lives. Charlie's 
going in to see if it's safe." 

He was back in half an hour, 
wearing shoes and carrying Mazurin's sandals ^wrapped in a 
bundle. He looked worried. 
"There's hell to pay," he told Eve, 
then turned to Mazurin. "I guess 
you're on the level, all right. Those 
col keyed things of yours — the 
tweedledums and so forth — have 
been popping up all over this area 
for the last twenty-four hours.- The 
Worstas are going crazy. They 
can't figure it out, and it scares 
them. The place is swarming with 
troops and no-goods." 

"National Guardsmen," Eve explained to Mazurin, seeing his 
puzzled look. "N. G. — no good. 
They're a bunch of picked stinkers, 
probably about like your ICS. Any


body ever call your crowd the Icks, 
by the way?" 

Charlie made an impatient gesture, cutting off Mazurin's reply. 
"Here's what we're up against," 
lie said. "Baucrnt'cind got through 
to H.Q. all right, and they'll send 
a 'copter in time to .get us to rendezvous. But the woods are full of 
patrols— we're lucky we haven't 
been picked up before now. The 
only place we'll be safe is in 
Bauernfeind's sub-cellar." 

He stared at Mazurin's outlandish costume. "You and I probably 
can get through all ri^ht, one at a 
time," he said to Eve, "but he's a 
problem. I was ready to ditch him 
if we had to, but Baucrnfcind says 
we've got _to take him along; the 
Central Council wants him. Wc 
couldn't figure out any way to take 
those cuffs off, without bringing a 
machine shop out here. Best we 
could think of was this." 

HE UNFOLDED his bundle 
and produced a long-sleeved 
robe, a pair of scissors, needles and 
thread. "There arc two or three 
different sects in the hills around 
here," he explained. "This isn't 
cjuitc the color any of 'em wear — 
Bauernfeind got it from a theatrical cos turner's— but he thinks it 
will pass. We'll have lo cut it open, 
so he can get: his arms into the 
sleeves, and then sew him into it." 
He picked up the scissors and 
spread the robe out over his knees. 
"No, not that way," said Eve, 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



and took the scissors from him. 
'Underneath, where it won't show." 
She rapidly snipped the robe apart, 
starting in the middle of the chest, 
upward to the end of each sleeve. 

The result looked like nothing 
that would ever serve as a garment 
again, but she slipped it over Mazurin's head, brought the dangling 
top part over his shoulders and, 
working swiftly, sewed it into shape 
again. 

"That'll hold," she said, "if you 
don"t wave your arms around. Remember, you've got your hands 
clasped in meditation, and you keep 
your eyes down. What about those 
sandals, Charlie?" 

"Half the crackpots in California wear them," he said. "And 
that long hair of his looks natural 
in this getup. Let's move along." 

Mazurin did as he was told. His 
brad ached miserably, and it 
seemed to him that his situation 
was getting worse by the minute. 
From the time that he had been 
captured by the Worstas, he'd had 
no power of decision whatever; 
and, even worse, he still had no 
idea what he could do if he were 
free to do it. 
. Mazurin walked forward me
64 



chanically, still only half attentive. 
Just suppose lie were to settle down 
in this century — providing he could 
get out of this present mess alive. 
Suppose he married and had 
progeny. That would obviously 
make hint an ancestor, from the 
viewpoint of his own time. Then 
it would be just as important to 
save his own neck as anybody 
else's! . . . 

Wait a minute, there was something funny about that line of 
reasoning. Everybody, theoretically, 
could continue his own line. So 
when was an ancestor an object of 
veneration and when was he just 
a person? It couldn't be merely a 
matter of elapsed time, could it? 
Because elapsed time was subjective, an abstraction, a point of view. 
From where he was now, the world 
he came from didn't even exist; 
it was just a remote future possibility. But — 

IT WAS too much. Mazurin 
thought he saw the glimmer of 
a final answer, but he couldn't pursue it. It made him feel dizzy when 
he tried. 

They clambered cautiously up 
to the top of the ridge, rccon

 



noitcred, and went down the other 
side to where a dusty road showed 
through the trees. Directly ahead 
oi them, when they reached the 
road, were the outskirts of a small, 
weatherbeaten town. They waited 
for twenty minutes before a squad 
of soldiers hanging around in front 
of a warehouse decided to go elsewhere. Twice they heard distant 
shots, and once a confused sound 
of yelling. 

Mazurin sighed with relief when 
they finally reached a fairly wellpopulated street. Mingling with the 
crowd, Charlie in front, then Mazurin, and Eve bringing up the 
rear, they weren't conspicuous, but 
as a group tbey had been decidedly 
peculiar. And if they looked nervous, he decided, it was in character; 
so did most of the people he saw 
around him. Every block or so they 
passed a patrol of green-uniformed 
men, hands on the straps of their 
slung missile weapons, looking 
alertly to each side as they walked. 

The three bunched momentarily 
as they waited for a traffic light 
to change, and Charlie murmured, 
' ' Two blocks more, then half a 
block to the right. It's the plate 
called 'Hi-Tone Tailors.* Go 
straight to the back and down the 
stairs." 

He stopped talking as a grccnuni formed officer paused nearby and 
glanced at them. The light changed 
and they started across the street. 
Mazurin kept his eyes down, as 
directed, even when a loud whir
M 



ring noise approached him from 
behind and hovered over him. 
Immediately thereafter, something 
mushy hit him on the head and 
slithered down his face, blinding 
him momentarily. 

He heard startled cries around 
him. The next instant, the mushy 
something had reached his nose 
and was' trying to crawl up it. 
Strangling, Mazurin unwarily 
opened his mouth, and the stuff 
crawled into that, too. He swallowed as much as he could — it was 
lemon-flavored — and spat the rest. 

He looked up just in time to see 
another glob hurtling toward him. 
He flung up his hands instinctively, 
and heard the popping threads as 
Eve's hasty stitching gave way. 

ABOVE him the flangs were 
raining down. The whirring 
noise, he found, proceeded from 
the blades of a helicopter that was 
hovering over the intersection. Two 
grecn-un i formed men in its cab 
were leaning out to peer in amazement and horror at the four loudspeaker horns fixed to its underside. 
From these, in an apparently endless flow, issued the flangs. They 
were piling up underfoot now, 
climbing up people's trouser legs, 
squirming in a custafdy wave toward the comparative darkness of 
doorways. 

Desperately, Mazurin warded off 
another yellow blob, leaped the 
writhing form of a fat citizen who 
had flangs in his pants, and then 


 



lost his own footing, skidding half 
the width of the street and fetching up against a green-uniformed 
soldier. He saw the soldier's eyes 
widen as he Caught sight of the 
wristcuffs. Then there was a. shout 
and a whirl of motion, and something hard struck him solidly on 
the back of the head. 

LIGHT brought him to: blinding, hot yellow light that 
shone through his closed lids and 
made his eyes water fiercely. He 
tried instinctively to turn his head 
aside, and found he couldn't. For 
a moment he couldn't orient himself; he was being put to the auestion, that was obvious, but what 
for? He hadn't done anything — or 
had he? How had he made out on 
that time mission ? He had a dim 
recollection of something unpleasant . . . 

The rest of the memories came 
back then, and Mazurin groaned. 
He was in the hands of the Wocstas again, those peculiarly unpleasant ancestors who were incredibly 
the founders of his own state; and 
some of the police methods in' this 
century were crude, he remembered. 

They'd got the other two, undoubtedly. They'd all been close 
together when the flangs started 
falling, and the soldiers would have 
rounded up everybody in sight after 
they caught him. Now it was going to be bad. Now it was going 
to be very bad. 

He heard a sudden "Ouch!" and 



then a stifled shriek. A moment 
later he understood the reason; 
something needle-sharp was jabbed 
an inch 'into his left buttock. He 
added his outcry to the others, 
whereupon a voice said, "They're 
ready, Mr. President." 

"Proceed," said a slightly lisping voice. "Begin with the girl." 

"Your name is Gertrude Meyer?" 
said the other. 

Mazurin heard the girl gasp. She 
said, "Yes." 

"You are a member of the underground society of wreckers and 
assassins known as the Freedom 
Party, and you are known to your 
co-conspirators as Eve?" 

Again the gasp, and again, 
"Yes." 

"You are aware of a plot to 
assassinate the President?" 

The gasp, a pause, then another 
gasp. "Yes!" 

"What is the nature of this 
plot?" 

This time Eve sobbed. "Oh, 
don't do that — oh!" 

"What is the nature of this 
plot?" 

"Oh! I don't know — " She 
shrieked and then Mazurin heard 
her weeping. "I'll never tell you 
— oh! — anything. Oh!" 

Mazurin found himself struggling like a wild man against his 
shackles. He had an idea he knew 
what they were doing to Eve; it 
was a traditional method of interrogating females, so they'd probably 
had it even this early. It was very 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



87 



nearly infallible, and very unpleasant to think about. 

EVE'S cries grew louder and 
more frequent Finally she 
screamed and there was silence for 
a while. Then the interrogation began again. After twenty minutes. 
Eve began telling all she knew. 

It was a primitive plot, and it 
seemed to Mazurin that it could 
have had only a slender chance of 
success even in so barbaric an era 
as this one. In his own time, nothing whatever would be gained by 
assassinating the Chief Executive; 
the next eligible member of the 
Executive Families would simply 
take over. What you had to watch 
out for was thought subversion and 
heresy. 

Here, apparently, the critical area 
was at the (op. Blodgett was so 
obsessed by the idea that someone 
in his hierarchy might kick him 
out, as he'd done to Carres, that 
he'd made sure lh.it the whole 
structure would collapse without 
him. 

The Freedom Party knew this, 
or guessed it, according to Eve. 
They didn't know exactly what 
would happen if they killed Blodgett, but they were pretty sure it 
would be fatal to the present dictatorial group. In any case, they'd 
be rid of Blodgett and would, at 
worst, take their chances on his 
successor being less brutal. 

The time they'd picked was an 
annual celebration at which Blod


gett traditionally showed himself. 
It was always held in a big outdoor arena, and there would be 
thousands of spectators. Blodgett 
would be well guarded, of course, 
but they couldn't possibly screen 
everybody who got into the arena. 
All the revolutionists needed was 
an inconspicuous weapon, and it 
seemed that the underground's 
scientists had perfected one about 
eight months ago and had been 
turning them out in quantity in a 
hidden factory. Eve didn't know 
where the factory was. She and 
Charlie were the liaison agents, 
who were to pick up the completed 
weapons from other agents and lake 
them to distribution points. 

The weapon was a miniature bazooka. Only two inches long, it 
could he concealed so well that 
only the most rigorous search would 
find it, and its range was more than 
adequate for the job they wanted 
to do. Accuracy would have been 
too much to ask for, but they had 
intended to concentrate the fire of 
several hundred weapons on the 
rostrum, and hope that Blodgett 
would be killed. 

The questioners took Eve 
through the whole story again, then 
started on Charlie. He held out 
for a few minutes, but he talked. 
He knew no more than Eve. 

THEN it was Mazurin' s turn. 
The first question was: 
"What is your name?" and it was 
followed instantly by the touch of 



as 




 



warm metal on the back of his 
hand. 

Only a reminder, Mazurin 
guessed. They thought he was valuable and wanted to be very careful 
not to injure him seriously; but if 
he didn't answer satisfactorily, the 
iron would get hotter. And many 
things, Mazurin knew, could be 
done with iron not hot enough to 
burn. 

He answered the question with 
his full name. The next was, 
"Where do you come from?" He 
told the truth, not expecting to be 
believed, but unable to think of 
any lie that would be more credible. 

There was a muttered consultation, then, "Do you maintain 
that you can tell us about events 
which are to us in the future, because your knowledge of what is 
to you history?" 

Mazurin said, "Yes, only — " 

Blodgett's lisping voice interrupted him. "That's enough. General, this information is restricted. 
Take him into my private office. I 
will continue the interrogation personally." 

The light clicked off, and Mazurin felt the shackles being 
loosened. 

"Prisoner, have you given any 
of this information to these other 
two?" 

Mazurin hesitated, trying to figure out which was the dangerous 
answer, yes or no. The President's 
voice said, "Never mind, General. 



I will assume that he has. Bring 
all three of them into my private 
office. Here, give me those manacle 
keys." 

Someone hauled Mazurin off the 
table on which he had been lying 
and locked his wrists together. He 
was able to open his smarting eyes 
after a moment, but he could see 
nothing except the after-image of 
the brilliant interrogation light. 
Hands turned him, pushed him, 
caught him when he staggered and 
kept him moving. He heard 'the 
shuffle of other feet. Eve was crying quietly. 

A door was opened ahead of 
them. Mazurin was led forward a 
few steps and then shoved into a 
deep cushioned chair. Footsteps receded and the door shut again. 
Deep silence fell instantly, punctuated by their breathing and the 
President's soft footsteps, then the 
slight creak of a swivel chair. 

"Now," said Blodgett's voice, 
apparently from some little distance. "We are entirely private 
here; this room is soundproof and 
spyproof. Tell me all about the 
future of my regime, Mr. Mazurin 
■ — and, I warn you, tell me the 
truth." 

MAZURIN'S vision was clearing rapidly. Directly ahead 
of him, twenty feet away across a 
deep carpet and a huge polished 
desk, sat Blodgett. He didn't look 
anything like the pictures in the 
histories. He was short and plump, 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



89 



and he looked crafty and nervous 
and worried. Mazurin glanced to 
his right. There was a row of chairs 
like his own, and in two of them, 
(Mifiacled like himself, were Eve 
and Charlie. Eve was bent over 
with her head in her hands; 
Charlie was rigid and stony-fated. 

Perhaps the history books had 
idealized Blodgett's appearance. It 
didn't matter. Mazurin was in the 
Presence and he was awed. 

"In case any of you arc thinking 
of attempting violence against me," 
remarked Blodgett, "don't." He 
showed them a heavy little machine-gun, mounted on a wheeled 
frame, that stood on liis desk. "You 
are too far away, and those extremely comfortable chairs are in
90 



gemiously hard lo get out of. Also, 
this room contains a minor arsenal. 
I could fight off a regiment here, 
if I had to. Now, Mr. Mazurin. 
talk. You needn't be afraid of telling the truth, whether you think I'll 
like it or not. You're a mine of 
information, and I expect to be 
able to use you for a long time to 
come. So tell me the unvarnished 
truth." 

Mazurin told him. 

Blodgett smiled at the end of it. 
"One thing more, Mr. Mazurin. At 
what age will I die?" 

"I don't remember exa Sly, Your 
Honor. About eighty, as I recall." 

"Good, good," said Blodgett. 
"Surprisingly good." He took a 
seedless grape from the bowl in 


 



front of him and popped it into 
his mouth. "You arc sure, Mr. Ma 
zurin, that you have not colored 
this talc to please my fmcy? No, 
I can sec that you are sincere; you 
have no reason to lie." 

He ate another grape, smiling;, 
pushed the bowl aside and leaned 
confidently over the desk. , 

"If you had prophesied disaster, 
Mr. Mazurin," he said, "I should 
never in the world have believed 
you . Do you kn ow why ?" The 
pause was rhetorical. "Because I belong to the ages. I know it I have 
felt it since I was a young man. I 
was born to rule the world. Would 
you believe that I have known that 
since I was twenty? And my rule 
is destined to endure; I knew that. 



"Why? Because I started with 
what every other conqueror tried 
in vain to achieve — a world dominion. It is all the world or none, 
Mr. Mazurin. Napoleon knew that. 
Hitler knew that. Stalin knew thai. 
And that was the inexorable law 
that humbled each in his turn. 
TTicy tried to achieve peace 
through war— fatal, fatal. They had 
to try, of course. They were born 
to rule, too, but the wrong time." 

He talked on interminably, 
his face y, rowing flushed and his 
eyes glistening. He gestured, he 
smiled, he frowned. Didactic, he 
stood up and leaned earnestly over 
the table. Self-satisfied, he sat back 
and popped grapes into his mouth. 
Mystical, he stared at the ceiling. 



DON'T LIVE IN THE PAST 



It was during the latter phase 
that Mazurin — like the other two, 
half-stunned by oratory — suddenly 
came awake. From the muzzle of 
the squat weapon on Blodgett's 
desk, a tiny green bubble bulged. 
As Mazurin watched, the bubble 
grew to half an inch dropped to 
the desk and rolled until the edge 
of the fruit-bowl stopped it. 

Mazurin felt suddenly cold all 
over. He darted a glance to his 
right. Eve was looking at the floor 
and had seen nothing; but Charlie 
was looking at him with one eyebrow raised, an expression that 
said plainly, What is it? 

Mazurin looked back at the 
President. Blodgett brought a rolling period to a close, smiled soulf ully, sighed, and became stern. 

"As for you, sir," he said, "your 
destiny is allied with mine. To this 
favor you must submit. I do not 
ask, I give. I give you a living god, 
as you have yourself justly described 
me, to worship and follow faithfully all of your life. And I give 
you what is immeasurably more 
precious than the schoolboys' history you give me — I give you a 
place beside me in all the history 
that's yet to be written!" 

For an instance, that idea captured Mazurin's imagination. What 
a fantastic end to his assignment 
that would be — the Chief Executive, and the ISC Intelligence chief, 
and everybody, worshipping every 
holy day at his shrine! 

Even while that thought raced 



through his mind, Mazurin watched 
the tiny green globule in utter fascination. If Blodgett reached for 
that globule, thinking it a grape, 
then for the first time in this whole 
misbegotten affair Mazurin would * 
have reached a point of decision. 
And to save himself he couldn't 
tell whether he wanted that or not. 
He knew what he wanted to do, 
well enough, but he felt the first 
premonitory stirrings of a guilt that 
he knew would plague him for 
years after the act. What right had 
he to interfere with the lives of 
millions of still unborn? 

Mazurin, he told himself, you're 
an ancestor.' He glanced at Eve's 
pale, drawn face. see to it that 
you are, he added. 

BLODGETT'S open palm came 
down on the desk, sideswiping 
the fruit bowl. The bowl wobbled 
elliptically arpund the desktop, 
spilling grapes. But the nearest to 
Blodgett's hand was still the globe 
that was not a grape. 

"iJow say you, sir?" demanded 
Blodgett. "Destiny or death?" 

His hand hovered, as ready for 
one gesture as another. He glared 
at Mazurin. 

Mazurin took a deep breath. "I 
choose destiny, Your Honor." 

Blodgett's features relaxed. His 
hand dropped gently on the table, 
the pudgy fingers curling. Gently 
they closed on the green sphere. 
Smiling benignly, Blodgett popped 
it into his mouth. 



92 




 



He stayed that way, without 
changing posture or expression, for 
three Jong seconds. Then his eyes 
bulged. A shout formed itself on 
his lips, but no sound came out. 
He — withered somehow, shrank indescribably in his uniform. There 
was a look of horror and of passionate appeal in his eyes. And 
then, suddenly, Blodgett was not 
there any longer. 

To the others, it looked as if he 
had simply vanished out of the 
world of men. But Mazurin, shuddering, knew that his fate had not 
been that simple- — or that pleasant. 

Eve gasped, "What was it? That 
grape he ate — " 

Mazurin felt sick. "A mangel." 

Charlie demanded, "What's a 
mangel? What did it do to him?" 

MAZURIN said shakily, "You 
could torture- me in the subtlest or crudest ways and I would 
not tell you. This primitive civilization is not ready to know anything 
at all about mangels. Nothing!" 

He put his head in his hands. 
One part of him knew that Blodgctt 
was a stinker; the other part was 
simply saying, You let him eat a 
mangel. You killed him. The most 
sacred ancestor of all, the Father of 
the World. 

He heard the other two talking 
in low, tense voices. Eve said, "Are 
you thinking what I'm thinking?" 

"Blodgett had already started 
making himself up to look like his 
propaganda pictures." 



"Yes. We could put it over, 
Charlie. They'd have no choice. It's 
either agreement or total collapse." 

"Gone," Mazurin moaned. 
"Blodgett. The beautiful society he 
built with his giant intellect — " 

"No," said Charlie. "None 
it's lost. Except the worst part 
your civilization." 

"And certainly not the mo 
sacred ancestor," Eve added. "N 
the Father of the World." 

Mazurin, lost in misery, looker 
up. "But the mangel got him. Blodgett is gone." He touched his forelock absently. 

"You're here," said Eve. "You 
know what the future is supposed 
to be like. You'll build Blodgett's 
world — with a few important 
changes." 

"Oh," Mazurin said, suddenly 
realizing. "You'll put one of your 
men in Blodgett's place and I'll 
advise him on what I remember." 

Charlie leaned over his chair. 
"One of our men — one of everybody's." 

"Isn't it obvious?" asked Eve, 
squeezing Mazurin's arm. "The 
Father of the World, the most 
sacred ancestor, will be a descendant." 

"He doesn't get it," Charlie said. 

"You," Eve stated, "will be 
Blodgett." 

Mazurin started to touch his 
forelock. "Me?" he asked dazedly, 
then finished the reverent gesture. 

He Was an ancestor, after all.

MARS CHILD 



Synopsis 

T4ORTY years hi the life of a 

p timet is nothing — especially 
when that planet is ancient Mars. 
It has been that long since the first 
Earth rocket crashed at the southern 
apex of Syrtis Major; almost that 
long since the frst too-hopeful 
colonists folloived, three thousand 
doomed souls, all dead before the 
delayed relief ship arrived. 

forty years during which a barren world played host to, successively, a handful of explorers and 
a few score prospectors with naturally "Marsworthy" lungs; a thousand or so latter-day homesteaders 
with their lean, silent women; a 
dozen, then two dozen industrial 
settlements; and at last, almost 
forty years after the first failure, 
another attempt at permanent 
colonization. 

Sun Lake City Colony is unique 
on Mars; it is a cooperative without 
industrial backing. Its members 
range from laborers Jo accomplished 
scientists, with one convictidn hi 
common: that Earth is through as a 
habitation for man because of its 
wrecked ecology, overcrowding, and 
the imminence of a cataclysmic radiological war. The Colony hopes as 
soon as possible to establish an agricultural cycle that will enable it to 
exist self -sufficiently on the hostile 
alien planet. 

Until that goal is attained, and 
until the colonists can find an acceptable substitute for Earth-import 

95 



OxEji — the "oxygen enzyme" pills 
that enable humans to breathe Mars 
air — Sun Lake must maintain business relations with Earth. To this 
end the Colony maintains a laboratory to refine and concentrate 
radiosotopes from Mars' naturally 
low- radioactive soil. 

In Sun Lake, a baby boy is born 
to Jim and Polly Kandro, a couple 
who emigrated parity to get away 
from the scene of half a dozen 
tragic miscarriages on Earth. The 
Colony's doctor, Tony Hellman, attends /he birth; he is assisted by 
Anna. Willcndorf, who came to the 
Colony as a glassbloiver, but whose 
extraordinary quality of understanding and sympathy makes her an 
excellent part-time nurse. 

The baby is piled to a specially 
designed oxygen mask. OxEn cannot be absorbed by infants, and the 
Colony lost its first-born baby because they . could not produce 
enough oxygen to keep a full-size 
oxy tent operating. The child is 
named Sun Lake City Colony Kandro by his proud parents — Sunny 
for short. 

Tony leaves the new mother and 
child in Anna's care, and goes to 
piake his routine morning check of 
the. Lab; he is radiological safety 
monitor for the Colony as well as 
doctor. While he is there, the Lab 
is visilcd by a delegation of the 
military. 
Personally commanding the 
search party is Hamilton Bell, 
Planetary Affairs Commissioner for 



the Panamerican World federation 
— the top man on Mars — acting on 
a complaint made by Hugo Brenner. Brenner, a drug manufacturer, 
claims a priceless 100 kilograms of 
marcaine have been stolen from his 
factory. The marcaine "scent" was 
traced to a point near the Colony 
by means of an electronic device 
known as the Bloodhound, operated 
by a conscientious young officer, Lt. 
Ed Nealey. 

Bell, who has absolute dictatorial 
powers in iutercolony matters, proposes a search which would ruin 
the Lab and contaminate ready-logo shipments of radioactives. Tony 
and two other members of the Colony Council, Mimi Jonathan and 
Joe Gracey, bargain with the Commissioner and accept a desperate 
alternative. They will be permitted 
to conduct their own search in their 
own way, but they must deliver both 
the thief and the stolen marcaine 
before Shipment Day — three weeks 
off — or the Colony will be sealed 
off by a military cordon for a period 
of six months while an official 
search is made. This is in accordance with an obsolete law formulated in the days of annual rockets. 
Now, however, Sun Lake, like all 
Mars, is geared to ninety-day rocket 
intervals; missing two shipments 
would be a catastrophic blow to the 
Colony's economy. 

Bell marches off with his soldiers, 
and Tony goes to make the daily 
rounds of his patients. He sees, 
among others, Joan Radcliff, a fa


96 




 



natically idealistic colonist, who is 
slowly dying of a. disease the doctor 
cannot even diagnose. At hast he 
feels, if Bell's ultimatum spells the 
end of the Colony, it will sa ve 
Joan's life. Nothing short of that 
would send her back to Earth, for 
if she went the Colony would not 
allow her husband, Hank, to stay. 
Hank is a romantic youngster; going to Mars was his life's dream, 
but Sun Lake, with its dreams of 
permanence, has room only for 
"married or marriageable" members. 

Tony also sees Nick Cantrella, 
the fourth member of the Council. 
Nick is an inspired electronics man 
and machinist, and an inveterate 
optimist. Between them, they work 
out a plan to test everyone in the 
Colony for exposure to marcaine by 
means of the electro-encephalograph. Among those tested, in 
addition to all the colonists except 
the two bed-ridden women ( and 
Hank Rad cliff, who is away, getting 
some new medicine for Joan), are 
Learoyd, an old prospector- who 
happened to be in town that day, 
and the Tollers, an early homesteader couple who live nearby. But 
all the results are negative; they 
find no evidence of exposure. The 
next step in the search will be a 
house-to-house inspection of the 
Colony. 

Meanwhile, Sunny is having 
/rouble nursing. The new mother 
becomes terribly worried, and when 
left alone for a short time, she has 



a d ream or hal lucinatio n, and 
babbles hysterically to the doctor 
about a "Brownie" that was peering in the window at the baby. 

The situation takes a sudden turn 
for the worse when Harve Stillrnan, 
the chief radioman, turns up with 
unexpected news; the rocket is in 
radio range, and will land the next 
day — two weeks earlyt 

CHAPTER NINE 

TONY got four hours' sleep 
before Tad Campbell came 
banging on his door at 3:15 
A. M. The boy's enthusiasm was 
more than Tony could f ace; it 
would be easier to carry his own 
equipment than to answer questions 
while he was dressing. He sent Tad. 
to wait at the plane and put some 
"coffee" on to brew, then did a last 
quick check of his portable health 
lab, making sure that there was 
nothing overlooked in the hasty 
preparations after the news about 
the Earth ship. 

Gulping down the hot brew, he 
reviewed the instructions he had 
given Anna : f cedings for Sunny 
Kandro; bacitracin for Dorothy; 
ointment and dressings for Joan, 
another injection if she needed it; 
and under no circumstances sedative 
fur Mrs. Beyles. 

He couldn't think of anything 
predictable he had failed to provide 
for. He folded the lab to make a 
large carrying case and lugged his 
burden up the gentle slope that led 



MARS CHILD 



97 



to the landing field where Lazy 
Girl, the Colony's transport plane, 
waited. 

Bea Juarez was warming the icy 
motors with a blowtorch. Lttzy 
Girl's motors were absurdly small; 
their shafts spun on zero-friction 
air bearings. Air-bearings dated 
from the guided missiles of 1950, 
but their expensively precise machining ruled them out for Earth. 
Shipping space to Mars was high 
enough to override the high manufacturing cost. Air-bearing motors 
were small and light; therefore virtually everything on Mars that 
turned or slid, turned and slid on 
molecules of gas instead" of oily 

films. 

The bearings improved the appc.ir.uice not only of machinery but 
of mechanics. Bea looked tired, 
cold, and unhappy; but she lacked 
the grease-smeared dinginess that 
would have marked her on Earth. 
The girl nodded to him, ran a hand 
over the moisture condensing on the 
metallic surface, and applied the 
torch to a new spot. 

She shook her head doubtfully. 
"Don't blame me if she falls apart 
in mid-air after we take off. I put 
her together with spit overnight, 
Tony. She was scattered all over 
the field for a hundred-hour check. 
You'd think they'd let you 
know . . ." she grumbled, then 
broke off and grinned. "What the 
hell, if we blow up halfway between here and there, we don't 
have to worry about marcainc any 



more ! Climb aboard, Doc." She 
snapped off the torch. "Hey, Tad! 
The doc needs a hand with his contraption." 

/TTONY felt a. twinge of conX science as Tad hopped out of 
the plane and ran to take the big 
box. It must have been a blow to 
the boy, to be deprived of carrying 
the heavy equipment from the hospital. 

"How's it going?" Tony asked 
genially, "You seem to be getting 
along fine without your tail bone." 

"Okay," the boy grunted. 

He eased the box into the cabin, 
pulled it out of the way, and 
reached down a condescend ing 
hand to help Tony. "It don't seem 
to matter," he added, when the 
doctor was inside. "You'd never 
know it wasn't there." 

Tad was the recent victim of an 
unhappily humorous accident. Butted in the seat by an angry goal, 
he'd had his coccyx severely fractured, and the doctor had had to 
remove the caudal vertebrae. It 
probably qualified, Tony thought, 
as another of those history-making 
occasions — the Colony's first spinal, 
if you want to stretch the term, 
operation. Historic or not, it was 
a permanent bond between the boy 
and the doctor — the only one who 
had been able to take it seriously. 

Tony padded a couple of spare 
parkas into a comfortable couch on 
the cabin floor and stretched out. 
The plane had no seats. Coming 



98 




 



Kick, they'd sit on the bare floor, 
and the parkas would have another 
use. The ship was unheated and 
the newcomers weren't likely to 
have warm clothes unpacked. 

Lazy Girl was short on comfort 
and speed cannibalized on Mars 
from the scrapped remains of obsolete models discarded by wealthier 
colonies. Tony, who didn't fly himself, had been told that she handled 
easily and flew an immense payload without complaining. 

Tad had built himself a luxurious 
nest of parkas. He pulled the last 
one up around his shivering shoulders, leaned back, and examined 
the interior of the plane with a 
good imitation of a practiced appraisal. 

"Nice job," he pronounced 
finally. "You don't get them like 
this back on Earth." 

"You sure don't," Bca agreed 
ironically from the pilot's seat. 
"Hold on to your hat. Here we 
go!" 

Say what you like about Mars, 
about the Colony, about the poor 
old relic of a plane, Tony thought, 
when you took a look at the kids 
you began to understand what it 
was all about. A year ago, Tad had 
been a thoroughly obnoxious brat. 
But how could he be anything else 
on Earth? 

THEY were all that way. You 
got born into a hate-thy-neighbor, en vy-thy- neighbor, murder-thyneighbor culture. In your infancy 



your overworked and underfc 
mother's breast was always withdrawn too soon and you were filled 
again and again, day after day, 
-with blind and squalling Cage. You 
were a toddler and you snatched at 
another one's bit of candy; you 
were hungry and you hated him; 
yon fought him. You learped big 
boys' games — Killakraut, Wackawop,~ Nigger inna Graveyard, 
Chinks an' Good Guys. Stcrmation 
Camp, Loot the City. The odds 
were you were hungry, always hungryNaked dictatorship and leader 
worship, oligarchy and dollar-worship; sometimes one was worse, 
sometimes the other. The forms 
didn't matter; the facts Hid. Too 
many mouths, not enough topsoil. 
Middle classes with their relatively 
stable, relatively sane families were 
growing smaller and being ground 
out of existence as still more black 
dirt washed into the ocean and still 
more hungry mouths were horn and 
prices went higher and higher — 
how long, in God's name, could it 
go on ? How long before it blew 
up, and not figuratively speaking 
either? 

The Panamerican World Federation, first with the most, refused to 
tolerate the production of mass-destruction weapons anywhere else in 
the world. Long calloused to foreign mutterings, the Western 
colossus would at irregular intervals fire off a guided missile on the 
advice of one of its swarm of in


MARS CHILD 



Eelligence agents. In Tartary or 
Trance or Zanzibar, then, an innocent-looking structure would go up 
in a smoke mushroom. But they 
never stopped trying, and some day 
Tartary or France or Zanzibar 
would launch a missile of its own 
and it would mean nothing less 
than the end of the world in fire 
and plague as the rocket trails laced 
continents together and the bombers rained botulisn, radiocobalt and 
flasks of tritium with bikinis in 
their cores. 

THE damned, poverty-ridden, 
swarming Earth ! Short of 
food, short of soil, short of water, 
short of metals- — short of everything 
except vicious, universal resentments and aggressions bred by the 
other shortages. 

That's what they were running 
from, the new arrivals he was going to meet today. He hoped there 

wouldn't he any more communicable disease carriers to quarantine 
at Marsport and fire back on the 
return trip without even a took 
around. There were supposed to be 
six medical examinations between 
the first application filed at the Sun 
Lake Society office in New York, 
and . embarcation. But things must 
have got appreciably worse on Earth 
since — he started a little at the 
thought — "since his time." It 
seemed that now anybody could be 
reached. They used to say everybody had his price. Maybe it was 
true. He'd never had a chance to 



turn down at really big bribe, so be 
couldn't say. But if six boards of 
doctors could all be fixed, everybody's price must have taken a 
drastic slump. 

Tad, sound asleep, rolled onto 
his stomach and humped up his 
behind., scene of the history-making operation, in a brief reversion 
to infancy. 

"How come the rocket's getting 
in early?" Bea called back. "I 
didn't even have time to ask Harvc 
about it last night, with the Girl 
spread out all over the field." 

"Something about the throat 
liner. They have a new remote control servicing apparatus on Earth," 
Tony said. "Gets the liner out and 
cleaned and in faster. We save two 
weeks on each trip, and get an 

extra trip — what is it? every two 

years?"' 

"Year and a half," iBca corrected. She was silent a moment, then 
snorted, "Rockets !" 

"At least," Tony dead-panned, 
"rockets give you a smooth ride. 
Fat chance of getting any sleep in 
this pile . . ." 

"The Girl never gave you a 
rough trip in your life!" she interrupted angrily. She pulled on the 
stick and swung the Girl into a 
downwind. 

The doctor drowsily studied her, 
silhouetted against the stars through 
the windshield. She was attached to 
the old crate- — ought to find herself 
a husband. It had looked like her 
and Flexner for a while, but then 



100 




 



tlic chemist had paired off with 
Vcrna Blau. As tlie motor warmed 
up, Bca unzipped her parka and 
shrugged out of it. Definitely, Tony 
decided, the best shape in Sun Lake. 
Trim, lined-down, athletic, but no 
doubt at all, from this angle, that 
the figure was feminine — even under the bulky sweater she still wore. 

HE LAY back on his improvised 
couch and reflected on how 
pleasant it would be- to stand behind her and run his hands down 
over her shoulders — infinitely pleasant just to stand behind her while 
she flew the ship. Pleasant but impractical. Play hell with her Estimated Time of Arrival at Marsport, for one thing, and, to take a 
longer view, he probably would 
end up by marrying her her and 
Lrizy Girl: the two went together. 

Tony stirred uncomfortably. 
While he was thinking idly goatish 
thoughts about Bca, Anna had 
turned up in his mind, with a halfsmile on her face. It was typical, 
he thought, puzzled ; Anna never 
in traded until the moment you 

wanted her . . . if you wanted her, 
he added unhappily, giving the 
verb a new meaning. Anna's smile 
was a tingling mystery; her dark 
eyes were wells of warmth in which 
a man could lose himself; but after 
all these months, he wasn't sure, of 
their color. And even when she 
crept into his mind, it was only 
from the neck up that he visualized 
her. 



That wasn't the way he saw Bca. 
Tony shook himself, stretched out 
and let his eyes linger on the girl 
in the pilot's scat until he fell 

asleep. 

ii 

THE sun was up when Bea cased 
the Freighter in among more 
planes than they had ever seen before on Arrival Day. They recognized the elegant staff -carrier from 
Sun Lake's neighbor, Pittco Three, 
but didn't know the other twelve 
that were pa rked . 

"Swell ride, Bca," said the doctor. "Now what is this dress parade 
all about . . .? Oh, sure. Douglas 
Graham is going to gunth Mars. 
These should be the bigshots from 
the commercial colonies." 

"1 hate these damned superficial 
gunthers," Bea said fiercely. "Is he 
going to bother Sun Lake?" 

"Nick thinks he might zip 
through at the end of his tour, if 
he lias time." He hopped to the 
ground. Tad following with the 
boxed lab. "You've got the shopping list, Bea?" the doctor asked. 
"I have to go over to the Ad Building. Don't think I'll have time for 
anything else. Can you get all the 
stuff?" 

"Sure, ' ' she said easil y. ' ' We' re 
not buying much this time." 

Tony ignored the bitter significance of the remark. "We'll see you 
later, then. I hope this red-carpet 
business for Graham doesn't slow 



MARS CHILD 



101 



things up too much. I'd like to get 
back before lunch." 

Tad was fidgeting next to him, 
waiting for a chance to break in. 

A year ago, the boy had spent 
two days in Marsport, when he 
arrived with his family and the 
other founding members of the 
Colony. Then he had nothing more 
than a pitying sneer for the village 
of 600 people; now it was a place 
of wonder. 

"Dr. Tony," he asked eagerly, 
"can we go to the Arcade?" 

"We can go through it," Tony 
decided. 

The Arcade was Aladdin's cave 
to Tad. To the Planetary Affairs 
Commission, which rented out 
booth space in the ramshackle 
building, it was a source of revenue. To Tony it was the stronghold 
of the irrepressible small retailer, 
who found his way even to Mars 
With articles he could buy cheap 
and sell dear ... a reminder of the 
extent to which Mars was already 
taking over the social and economic 
patterns of Earth. 

Booths at the Arcade did not display radiation counters, hand tools, 
welders, rope, radio, aluminum 
I-beams, airplane parts or halftracks. Those you bought at the 
P. A. C. Stores, which were reliable, conservative and dull. 

At the Arcade there was one 
booth which sold nothing but coffee in the cup: MARTIAN $2.00; 
EARTHS.IDE $15.00 (WITH 
SUGAR $25.00). Tony knew the 



privateer who ran this concession 
might be ruined by another arrival 
aboard today's racket, landing in 
paper-light clothes with his garment and personal luggage allowance taken up by bricks of 
Earthside coffee and sugar, burning 
to undercut the highwayman who 
had beaten him to the happy hunting grounds of Mars. 

At another booth the most beautiful collie, boxer and English shepherd pups were for sale at the 
astounding price of only twenty 
dollars each. The catch was that 
the proprietor of this booth was 
the only merchant on Mars with 
a stock of dog food. 

AT ANOTHER booth Tad's jaw 
dropped with perplexity. "Dr. 
Tony, what are those?" he asked. 
"Underwear, Tad. For women." 
"But don't they get cold in those 
things ?" 

"Well, 'they would if they went 
out and worked like Our women. 
But — well, for instance in'Pittco, 
over the Rim rock Hills from us, 
there are some ladies who only 
work indoors, where it's heated." 

"All heated? Not just beam heat 
on the beds and things?" 

"I'm afraid I don't really know. 
Say! Look at those boots there — 
aren't they something?" 

"Boy!" The boots were mirrorshiny zipper j obs. * 'What I 
wouldn't give for a pair of those! 
Put 'em on when new kids come 
in, and then watch them try to walk 



102 




 



around in Earth sandals, and get a 
load of that sand." 

Here on Mars, the price put the 
boots infinitely far out of reach for 
a boy like Tad, even if Sun Lake's 
policies did not prevent the purchase of such an item. Some supervisor in an industrial colony, Tony 
thought, would eventually acquire 
them as illusion of escape from the 
sands of Mars. 

And that reminded him. He 
turned to Tad. 

"By the way, what do you know 
about kids going barefoot around 
the colony? When did that start?" 

Baref oot ? ' ' Tad looked outraged. "What do you think we are 
—dopes?" 

"1 think," Tony answered drily, 
"that anybody who'd go strolling 
around the Rimrock caves without 
boots on is about as much of a 
jackass as he can be." 

"In the caves?'' This time Tony 
thought he detected a note of more 
honest horror. All the kids went 
barefoot sometimes in the experimental fields; everybody knew about 
it and pretended not to. The kids 
were pretty careful about not stepping on marked planted rows, and 
the fields had been processed to remove native poison-salts from the 
soil. 

"Listen, Dr. Tony," Tad said 
earnestly, "if any of the kids arcdoing that, I'll put a stop to it! 
They ought to know better! You 
remember that time you had to fix 
my hand, before the- — ufa — other 



thing, when I just thought I'd pick 
up a piece of rock and it practically 
sliced my finger off! They shouldn't 
be walking barefoot around there." 

"I remember." Tony smiled. 
" 'Sliced your finger off is a slight 
exaggeration, but I wouldn't like 
to have to handle a mess of feet likethat. If you know who's doing it, 
you tell them I said to cut it out 
... or they may not be walking at 
all after a while." 

"I'll let them know." Tad walked 
along silently, ignoring the bright 
displays as they passed, and Tony 
seized the chance to direct their 
footsteps out of the Arcade. "Dr. 
Tony," the boy said finally, "you 
didn't mean for me to tell you who 
it was in case I knew, did you?" 

"Lord, no !" The doctor had 
been hoping to find out. But he 
realized now what an error he'd 
almost made. 

A year ago, Tad had been as 
miserable a little snitch and talcbearer as Earth could produce. "I 
just want it stopped, that's all." 

"Okay, then." Tad's face relaxed 
into a friendly grin. "It will be." 

We've got to kee p got tig, t he 
doctor thought. For hi mself , f or 
the other adults, it didn't matter so 
much. But for the kids . . . 

iii 

TONY had absolutely no respect 
for Nowton, the P.A.C. medical 
officer, because Nowton was stupid. 
Fortunately Nowton was so stupid 



MARS CHILD 



103 



that he didn't realize this and 
greeted the Sua Lake medic joyfully. 

"Hear you ,bcen up to* tricks, 
boy! Why didn't you come to me 
instead? I got ways to get marcainc !" 

"Glad to hear it, and I'll bet you 
do. While we were stealing that 
marcaine, we also had a baby. Got 
a form?" 

"Corporal!" yelled Nowton. 
"Birth form!" A noncom produced 
the piece of official paper and Tony 
filled it in, checking weight and 
other data with notes in his pocket. 

"That hot pilot of yours still 
around?" asked Nowton. 

"Bea Juarez ? Sure. Interested ? 
Just tell her that her plane's a disgusting old wreck and you'H get 
her a new one. She always falls foe 
that line." 

"No kidding?" 

"Who'd kid you, Nowton? Say, 
is Ed Nealey anywhere?" 

"In the signal room. Where's 
Juarez, did you say?" 

"I'll see you, Nowton." Tony 
hurried off. 

HE FOUND the lieutenant reading a medical journal which 
had passed through his own hands 
months earlier, on its way around 
the joint subscription club of which 
both men were members. The club 
made it possible for them, in common with twenty-odd fellow-members on Mars, to keep up with 
technical and scientific publications 



without paying ruinous amounts in 
interplanetary postage. 
"Hello, Ed." 

Nealey put out his hand. "I 
didn't know whether you'd still be 
talking to me, Tony." 

"Hell, you don't give the orders. 
You have to play it the way Bell 
calls it. Ed, off the record — you're 
pretty sure it was one of our people?" 

"All I'm sure of, it wasn't a 
phony. To qualify with the Bloodhound on Earth, we had to follow 
made trails — where they dragged 
bags of an i s eed over the spoor. 
You can tell the difference. This 
one f aded and wobbled like the 
real thing. And we iost it not more 
than a couple of miles out of your 
place, head ed straight your way. 
Tony, have you searched?" 

"Some. We're not done yet." 
The doctor lowered his voice. 
"What's the matter with Commissioner Bell, Ed? Does he have anything special against us?" 

The lieutenant jerked his chin a 
little at a Pfc sitting with ea'rphones 
on his head, reading a comic book, 
and led the doctor into the corridor. 

"God, what a post!" he said. 
"Tony, all I know is that Bell's a 
lost soul outside the Insurantist 
Party's inner circle. He had fifteen 
years of being looked up to as the 
Grand Old Man of the Mexicaliforniarizonan Insurantists, and 
now he's been booted to Mars. 
He'd do anything, I believe, to get 




 



back into Hie party. And don't forget that Brenner's been a heavy 
contributor to the Insurantist campaign funds during the last three 
elections. You know I'm professional military and I'm not supposed to and don't want to have 
anything to do with politics — " 

Commissioner Bell came stumping down the corridor. "Lieutenant 
Ncaley,"*he interrupted. 

Nealcy came to as casual an attitude of attention as his years of 
drilling would allow. 

"Surely you have better things 
to do with your time than palavering with persons suspected of harboring criminals." 

"Dr. Hellman is my friend, sir!" 

"Very interesting. I suggest you 
go on about your duties and pick 
your friends more discriminatingly." 

"Whatever you say, sit." With 
slow deliberation, the lieutenant 
turned and shook Tony's hand. 
"I'm on duty now," he said tightly. 
"I'll see you around. So long, kid." 
He put his hand on Tad's shoulder, 
wheeled about smartly, and turned 
back into the signal room. 

"Come on, Tad," said the doctor. 
"WV'iv all done here. We might as 
well get out to the rocket field." 

CHAPTER TEN 

THEY were approaching the 
rocket field and what was, for 
Mars, an immense crowd — some 
five hundred people behind a broad 



while deadline marked on the 

tamped dirt of the field. It was an 
odd-looking crowd because it was 
not jammed into the smallest possible space, body to body, Earthfashion. The people stood separately, like forest trees, with a good 
square meter around each of them. 
It was a Mars crowd, made up of 
people with lots of room. Tony 
stopped well away from the fringe 
of the group. 

"This looks like a good spot," he, 
decided. "Put the box down there; 
we can start setting things up." 

"Doctor Hellman — hello!" A 
tall man, fully dressed in Earths iafl 
business clothes, strolled over. Tony 
had seen him only once before, 
when he had appeared at the Lab 
with Bell to make his monstrous accusation of theft. But Hugo Brenner was not an easy man to forget. 

"Hello," Tony said shortly, and 
turned back to his box. 

"Thought you might be here loday." Brenner ignored the doctor's 
movement away from him, and 
went on smoothly. "I want to tell 
you how sorry I am about what 
happened, Frankly, if I'd known 
the trail would lead to your place, I 
might have thought twice before \ 
called copper — but you understand, 
it's not the first time. I've let it go 
before. This time they took so 
much I couldn't very well overlook 
it." 

"I u ndcrstand perfectly," Tony 
assured him. "We disapprove of 
theft at Sun Lake too." 



MARS CHILD

"Well, I'm glad to hear you 
don't take it personally. Doctor. As 
a matter of fact, I'm almost glad it 
happened. I've heard a lot about 

you and the kind of job you've 
been doing over there. I wish we 
could have mot under more pleasant circum — " 

"It's very kind of you to say so," 
Tony interrupted, deliberately misunderstanding. "I didn't think a 
man in your position would be 
much impressed by what we're 
doing at Sun Lake." 

Brenner smiled. "I think Sun 
Lake is a very interesting experiment," he said in a monotone that 
clearly expressed his lack of interest. "What I had in mind . . ," 

"Of course, Mr. Brenner." Whatever the drug man had to say to 
him personally, the doctor did not 
wish to hear it. "Wc realize your 
only interest is in the recovery of 
your stolen goods. We're doing our 
best to find the thief . . . // he 
really is a member of our Colony, 
that is." 

"Please, Doctor, don't put words 
in my mouth. Naturally I'm interested in recovering my goods, but 
I'm not worried about it. I'm quite 
sure your people will turn up the 
guilty party." Again his voice carried a flat lack of conviction. 

"Commissioner Bell has seen to 
it that we turn up a. guilty party," 
Tony retorted. 

"I think the Commissioner was 
unnecessarily harsh." Hugo Brenner 
shrugged it off. "If it had been up 



to me . . . well, that's Bell's job; I 
suppose he has to handle it his own 
way. Let's quit beating around the 
bush, Doctor. I came over here to 
offer you a job, not to talk . . ." 
"No." 

"Suppose you listen to my offer 
first." 

"Nor 

"All right, then. Name your own 
terms. I'll meet your price: I need a 
doctor. A good one." 

"I don't want to work for you at 
any price." 

Brenner's mouth turned up at 
the corners. Obviously he enjoyed 
the game, and equally obviously he 
thought he was going to win. 

<*T ET mc mention a figure." He 
1—J moved closer. "One million 
dollars a year." 

Well, thought the doctor, now 
he had a clearer idea of what his 
own price was; now he knew it 
wasn't a million dollars. Ten times 
what he made in a peak year on 
Earth. He looked full into Brenner's smirking face, and knew 
something else: he hadn't been so 
clear-through boiling mad in a long 
time; and he was fed up with diplomacy. Deliberately, he raised his 
voice: "Didn't you hear me before, 
Brenner ? Or didn't you understand ?" 

He found it was gratifying to notice people turning his way, edging 
in to listen. 

"Lei me make myself absolutely 
clear," he went on loudly. "I don't 




 



want to work for you. I don't tike 
the business you're in. I know what 
you Deed a doctor for, and so does 
everyone else on Mars. If your boys 
over at Hop Heaven can't keep 
their noses out of your marcaine, 
that's not my worry. I don't want 
to be resident physician in a nart tit its factory. Stay away from me!" 

The smirk had left Brenner's 
face; it was ugly, contorted, and 
much too close. Tony realized, too 
late, that Brenner's fist was even 
closer. Abruptly, he stopped feeling 
like a hero and began to feel like a 
fool. 

'Then, quite suddenly, Brenner's 
fist was no longer approaching, and 
Brenner was flat on the ground. 
Tony tried to figure out what had 
happened. It didn't make sense. He 
became aware of a ring of grinning 
congratulatory faces surrounding 
him, and of Tad next "to him, giggling gleefully. He called to the 
boy curtly, turned on his heel, and 
walked back the few steps to his 
portable lab. 

Nobody helped Brenner to his 
feet. He must have got up by himself, because when Tony looked 
back, out of the corner of his eye, 
Brenner was gone. 

A short man bustled up. "I heard 
that. Dr. Hellman. I didn't see you 
hit him, but I heard you tell him 
off." He pumped Tony's hand delightedly. 

"Hello, Chabricr." That makes 
two of us, Tony thought — I didn't 
see myself hit him either. "Look, I 



know it's no use asking you not to 
■talk about it, but go easy, will you? 
Don't blow it up too much when 
you tell it." 

"It needs no amplification. You 
slap his face in challenge. He 
reaches for a weapon. You knock 
him unconscious with a single 
blow! You tell him: 'Hugo Brenner, there is not gold enough — 

"Knock off, will you?" begged 
the doctor. "He wanted me to work 
over at his place by Syrtis Major — 
Brenner Pharmaceuticals Corporation, whatever he calls it. You know 
all his people get a marcaine craving from the stuff that leaks out 6f 
his lousy machinery. He wanted me 
there to keep giving his boys cures. 
I said no and he offered me a lot of 
money and I got sore. I shot off my 
mouth. He started to sock me 
and — " 

And what? Tony still hadn't figured that out. He turned hack lu 
the box, still only half set up. 

Chabricr said thoughtfully: "So 
you know that much, eh? Then you 
know it's nothing new, this business of missing marcaine?" 

TONY abruptly turned back to 
him, no longer uninterested. 
"Brenner said something about previous thefts. What's it all about?" 

"Only what you said yourself." 
Chabrier shrugged. "What did he 
offer you ? Three hundred thousand? Four?" He paused, and when 
Tony made no reply, went on : 
"You can get better than that. It 



MARS CHILD 



107 



would be cheaper than junking his 
plant and building a new one." 

"I know I can pet better than 
that," the doctor said impassively. 
"What do you know about the 
missing marcaine, Chabricr?" 

"XTOTH1NG all of Marsport 
J*. 1 doesn't know. Was it in the 
neighborhood of half a million? 
That would be much less than the 
freight rates for new machines. 
He's used to freight being only a 
small part of his overhead. He ships 
a concentrated product." Chabricr 
chuckled happily. "How it must 
hurt when he thinks of importing 
plate and tubes and even, God forbid, cast iv gs. I tell you, a man 
doesn't know what freight can 
mean until he's handled liquor. 
Bulk is bad. Even just running the 
bulk licjuor jnto the glass-lined 
tanks of the rocket ships as bad. It 
means that Mars ships water to 
Earth! Actually! But the foolish 
laws say we cannot dehydrate, let 
the water be added on Earth, and 
still label it Mars licjuor." 

"Please," said Tony wryly. 
"Please, Chabrier!" 

The man shrugged. "So we take 
a little of the water out— fifty per 
cent, say. Water is water, they poirr 
it in on Earth, nobody knows, nobody cares. Bulk shipment is still 
bad, very bad. But bottles T Dr. 
Hellman, there is no known way of 
dehydrating a glass bottle. We ship 
them in, we fill them, we ship them 
back. They break, people steal them 



here and aboard ship, and at the 
Earth rocket port. All so the label 
can say 'Bottled on Mars' !'* 

"Muffle your sobs, Chabricr. I 
happen to know that people pay for 
Mars licjuor and pay a great deal 
for bottlcd-on-Mars. At least, you're 
legal, and I understand you makegood stuff." 

"I drink it myself," said Chabrier righteously. 

"To save the freight on Earthside rye?" Tony grinned, then 
asked seriously, "Listen, Chabricr, 
if you know anything about this 
marcaine business that wc don't, 
for God's sake, spill it! Wc ... I 
don't have to tell you how hard this 
thing is hitting us out at Sun Lake. 
What does all of Marsport know?" 

Was i t p erhap s s even - f i f t y ? ' ' 
■the oilier man asked blandly. 

Fair exchange, Tony decided. "A 
million," he said. 

"So? This I do not understand! 
Why so much for a doctor, if he is 
to have a new plant V* t .liabrkr 
shook his head, shrugged, and went 
on more briskly: "I have told you 
already, if you understand: Brenner 
needs a new plant. His machines 
are no good. They leak. His men 
inhale the micron dust, they get the 1 
craving, and they start to steal the 
product. Soon they arc no good for 
the work, and he sends them back 
to Earth. You see today how many 
new men he brings in? Then one 
day there is more marcaine missing. He . . ," 

"One minute, Chabrier. ' ' Tony

turned and signaled Tad to take a 
break, then moved off a few steps, 
and motioned to the other man to 
follow h im. ' 'You think it's a 
frameup?" he demanded in a low, 
intense voice. 

"You would have me speak 
against our Commissioner Bell?" 
Chabricr asked with only the faintest trace of sarcasm showing. "Such 
a thing i will not do, but I beg of 
you to consider, if Sun Lake Colony 
should be bankrupt, their Laboratory must be sold at auction by the 
Commissioner, and such a plant 
would suit Mr. Brenner very well 
indeed. They say here in Marsport 
the machinery in this Laboratory is 
adaptable to many kinds of production. They say it is good, tight, 
well-built equipment, it will not 
leak. Till now it seemed quite 
clear.** The little man shook his 
head doubtfully. "Now I do not 
know. A plant? Yes. A doctor ? 
Yes. But both . . . and he offered a 
million ! This I do not understand, 
unless he plans to work both plants. 
There is a rumor which has some 
currency today . . 

THE deep bass booming of the 
warning horn cut him off. People began edging away from the 
center of the field, terminating conversations, i ej oining their own 
groups. . 

' 'You will excuse me now ? I 
must go," Chabrier said, when the 
horn died down enough to permit 
conversation again. "I have my 



place reserved, -■but they will not 
hold it . . V 

"Place?" Tony, still trying to 
catch up with the implications of 
the' other man's news, didn't follow 
the quick shift. "What for? Oh, 
are you after Douglas Graham, 
too?" 

"Of course. I understand he is — 
let us say, a drinker. If I can reach 
him before any of these Other vultures . . . who knows? Maybe a 
whole chapter on Mars liquor!" He 
seized Tony's hand in a quick grasp 
of friendship. "Good luck, Doctor 
Hellman," he said, and dashed off, 
running ludicrously on his short 
legs to rejoin his own party before 
the landing. 

Tony searched the sky; the rocket 
was not yet in sight. He got back 
to work, swiftly now, setting up 
his equipment. Chabrier had mentioned a rumor. Never mind, there 
was enough to think about. 

The whole thing planned beforehand, to ruin Sun Lake. Maybe. 
Chabrier was notorious as a gossip 
and petty troublemaker. A frameup. 
Maybe. And how could they find 
out? Who was responsible? Who 
was innocent? Nealey, Nowton; 
Bell and Brenner; Chabricr with 
his fluid chatter and his shrewd 
little eyes. Nealey at least was a 
decent, competent man . . . Maybe. 
But how could you tell? How 
could you single them out? 

Parasites ! he thought bitterly, 
the cheerful Chabrier as much as 
the arrogant Brenner. Mars liquor 



MARS CHILD 



109 



brought fantastic prices because it 
was distilled from mashes of Martian plants containing carbohydrates, instead of being distilled 
from mashes of Earth plants containing carbohydrates. And the 
friendly, plump little man got 
plumper on the profits culled from 
Earth's neurotic needs. It wasn't 
really much of an improvement on 
Brenner's marcainc business. A 
minor difference in moral values, 
but all of them were parasites as 
long as they didn't devote their 
time to the terrible problem of freeing Mars from the shadow of 
Earth's dominance. 
• And what about our Lab? Unquestionably, it was better to concentrate radioactive methylene blue 
ior the- treatment of cancerous kidneys than it was to concentrate alkaloids for Earthside gow-heads, but 
that, too, was only a difference in 
moral values. Parasites, all . . . 
"The rockc-t!" yelled Tad. 

CHAPTER .ELEVEN 

IT LOOKED like a bit of the sun 
ai first ; that was its braking 
blasts seen from under. The monster settled -swiftly, roaring and 
flaring in a teasing mathematical 
progression of successively shorter 
blasts more closely spaced. When 
you could sec its silvery bulk in 
profile it was going pop-pop-poppop- pop, like a machine gun. It 
settled with a living splutter and 
stood on the field some two hun
110 





 



died meters from the crowd like a 
r e m cmbcrcd skysc raper. 

Trucks raced out to meet it. Inside, the doctor knew, crewmen 
were walking around capstans that 
fitted over and unscrewed ten kilogram hex-nuts. The trucks slowed 
and crawled between the fins on 
which the rocket stood, directly under its exhaust nozzle. Drivers cut 
and filled to precise positions; (lien 
platlorms jacked up from the crane 
trucks to receive the rim . of the 
roi kefs: throat. Men climbed the 
j.uks to fasten them. 

The captain must have radioed 
from inside the ship; the last of the 
first hex-nuts was off. Motor away! 
Slowly the platforms descended, 
taking the reaction engine with 
them. The crane trucks crawled off, 
two ants sharing an enormous burden. 



The crew inside was busy again, 
dismantling fuel tanks, while the 
Irikks moved to the inspcctiui-i>md 
repair shed off the field. A boom 
lifted off the motor, and the drivers scuttled back to receive the first 
installment of the fuel tanks, the 
second, the third and the last. 

"Now do the people come out?" 
asked Tad. 

"If the rocket hasn't got any 
more plumbing, they do," Tony 
told him. "Yes — here wc go." 
Down between the fins descended 
a simple elevator, the cargo hoist 
letting down a swaying railed platform on a cable. It was jammed 
with people. The waiting port officer waved them toward the Administration Building. The crowd, 
which had overflowed gently past 
the broad white line on the field, 
drifted that way, too. 




MARS CHILD 



"Stanchions! Get stanchions 
out!" the port officer yelled. Two 
field workers broke out posts and a 
rope that railed off the crowd from 
the successive hoist-loads of people 
herded into the Administration 
Building for processing. There was 
a big murmur at the third load— 
Gfaham ! The doctor was too far 
back to get a good look at the great 
man. 

The loudspeaker on top of the 
building began to talk in a brassy 
rasp: 

"Brenner Pharmaceuticals. Baroda, Schwartz, Hopkins, W. Smith, 
Avery fox Brenner Pharmaceuticals," it said. Brenner ducked under 
the rope to meet five men issuing 
from the building. He led them off 
the field, talking earnestly and with 
gestures. 

"Pittco! Miss Kearns for Pittco 
Three!" 

A pretty girl stepped through the 
door and looked about helplessly. A 
squat woman strode through the 
crowd, took the girl by the arm and 
led her off. 

Radiominerals Corporation got 
six replacements; Distillery Mars 
got a chemist and two laborers; 
Metro Films got a cameraman who 
would stay and a pair of actors who 
would be filmed against authentic 
backgrounds and leave next week 
with the prints. A squad of soldiers 
headed by a corporal appeared and 
. some of the field workers let out a 
cheer; they were next for rotation. 
Brenner got two more men; Kelly's 



Coffee Bar got Mrs. Kelly, bulging 
with bricks of coffee and sugar. 

"Sun Lake City Colony," said the 
loudspeaker. "W. Jenkins, A. Jenkins, R. Jenkins, L. Jenkins, for Sun 
Lake." •, 

"Watch the box," Tony called to 
Tad as he strode off. 

HE PICKED up the identification and authorization slips 
waiting for him at the front desk 
inside, and examined them curiously. Good, he thought, a family 
with kids. The loudspeaker was 
now running continuously. Two 
more for Chabrier, three engineers 
for Pittco Headquarters in Marsport. 

A uniformed stewardess came up 
to him. 

"Dr. Hellman ? From Sun Lake?" 
Her voice was professionally melodious, He nodded. "These are Mr. 
and Mrs. Jenkins." She turned to 
the family group behind her. "And 
Bobby and Louise Jenkins," she 
added, smiling. 

The kids were about seven and 
four years old respectively. Tony 
smiled down at them, shook hands 
with their parents, and presented 
his authorizations to the stewardess. 

" — Prentiss, Skelly and Zaretsky 
for Sun Lake," the loudspeaker 
called. 

"Excuse me, I'll be right back," 
Tony said and headed back to the 
desk. 

They gave him more authorization slips. He riffled through the 




 



papers quickly as he headed back to 
find the Jenkinses and wait for the 
newcomers. All different names. 
Only one family, the rest singles. 
Too bad. 

He hunted through his pockets 
and found two packets of peanuts, 
mutated beyond recognition into 
chewy objects with a flavor something like grape pop. 

By the time Bobby and Lou had 
overcome their shyness enough to 
accept the gifts, another stewardess 
was bringing up the rest of the 
group destined for Sun Lake. 

"Dr. Hellman?" Her voice was 
as much like the first stewardess' 
as her uniform, but according to 
ancient custom this one was blonde 
and the other brunette. "Miss 
Skelly, Miss Dantuono, Mr. Graham, Mr. Prentiss, Mr. Bond, Mr. 
Zarctsky," she said and vanished. 

Tony fibdded and shook hands 
all around. 

"Let's get out of here," he said. 
"It's quictei outside and I have to 
give you all a physical checkup, 
so — " 

"Again ?" one of the men 
groaned. "We just had one on 
board." 

"I think I've had a million different shots since I started all this,' ' 
the other girl put in. What was her 

name? LXintuono ? "Do we getmore needles?" 

"I'm afraid so. We have to be 
careful, you know." Some day he 
would meet a rocket, and nobody — 
but nobody— would make that par


ticular remark. Or perhaps that was 
too much to hope for. "Let's get 
out of here," Tony said again. Heoffered his hands to the children, 
and they started moving. 

BY THE time they reached Tad 
and the box that held the 
portable health lab, the crowd was 
already thinning out. 

"We'll get right to it," the- doctor addressed his group. "I'm sorry 
I can't examine you indoors under 
more comfortable circumstances, 
but I have to make a quick check before we can even let you on board 
the ship. It won't take long if we 
start right away." 

"Doesn't the port have facilities 
for this sort of thing?" someone 
asked. 

"Sure. They've got a* beautiful 
setup right inside the Ad Building. 
Anybody can use it. Sun Lake can't 
afford the price." 

He called them up one at a tunestarting with the Jenkinses, parents 
and then children, so the kids 
wouldn't have too much time to get 
apprehensive about the needles. His 
trained reflexes went through the 
business of blood and sputum 
tests, eye-ear-nosc-and-throat, fluoroscopy, and nervous-and-mental, 
while he concentrated on gelling 

acquainted. 

Names began to attach themselves to faces. He finished with the 
two single girls, and started on the 
men. The big, red-faced one was 
Zaretsky; skinny little bookkeeper 



MARS CHILD 



type was Prentiss, The talkative one 
was Graham. 

"First name?" Tony was filling 
in the reports while the samples 
went through analysis. 

"Douglas." 

"Drop-in or shares?" 

"Drop-in, I guess. On Earth we 
call it the working press." 

"Press?" Tony looked up sharply. 
"The Douglas Graham?" 

"The Tbh Is man. Didn't you 
know I was coming out?" Tony 
hesitated, and Graham asked quickly, "Your place is open to the press, 
isn't it?" 

"Oil, sure. We just — well, frankly, we didn't think you'd bother 
with us. Certainly didn't think 
you'd come to us first. We'd have 
rolled out the red carpet. " He 
grinned and pointed to the array of 
planes at the other end of the field; 
for the first time, he became aware 
of the curious and envious stares 
their small group was receiving 
from passersby. "Everybody else 
did. I guess we were about the only 
outfit on Mars that didn't at least 
hope to bring you back home today." He turned his attention to 
the checkup form. "Age?" 

"Thirty-two." 

FIOM appearance and general 
condition, Tony would have 
given the journalist ten more years; 
it was a shock to find that they 
were both the same age. He finished without further comment and 
went on to the next and last, a 



lanky blond youth named Bond. By 
the time he was done, the analyses 
and reaction tests were complete. 

The doctor checked them, over 
carefully. "You're all right," he announced to the group at large. "We 
can get started now." 

]t was a slow trip. None of the 
newcomers were accustomed to the 
low gravity; they were wearing 
heavy training boots acquired on 
board the rocket. And all of them 
were determined to see everything 
that was to be seen in Marsport before they took off. Tony led them 
across the spaceport field, and down 
the main street of Marsport, a 
mighty boulevard whose total 
length was something under five 
hundred yards, the distance from 
the space-port to the landing strip. 

He answered eager questions 
about the ownership and management of the hotels and office building that lined the block adjacent to 
the spaceport. These were mostly 
privately owned and privately built, 
constructed of glass brick. The native product had a sparkling multicolored sheen that created a fine 
illusion of wealth and high fashion 
— even when you knew that no 
building made of the stuff could 
possibly stand more than ten years ; 
the same slightly different chemical 
content of Martian potash that produced the lustrous coloration of the 
bricks made them particularly susceptible to -the damaging effects of 
wind and sand. Glass brick construction was, by far, more costly 



114 




 



than the rammcd-carth buildings at 
Sun Lake, or the scrap-shanties that 
characterized the PittCO camp across 
the Rimrock Hills from the Colony; 
but it was still much less expensive 
than the Earth-import steel and 
alumalloy used wherever strength 
and durability were important. 

THE Administration Building of 
the Planetary Affairs Commission, which occupied one entire side 
of the center block, was sheathed 
in .1 muted green alumalloy; the 
P.A.C Stores and official P.A.C. 
hotel, across the street, were respectively dull rose and dove gray. The 
doctor pointed out each building in 
turn to his wide-eyed group. The 
writer was as eager as any of the 
others, and asked as many questions. 
Tony was surprised; he had anticipated a bored sophistication. 

Graham responded equally unpredictably to the scries of interruptions they met with en route. 
Chabrier. was first, even before they 
had left the spaceport. He dashed 
up to pump Tony's hand and babble that he was delighted to see him 
again, and how well Tony looked 
despite his drab sojourn in the sodull Sun Lake where nothing ever 
happened. 

"But this is Mr. Graham, isn't 
it?" he exclaimed in delight. 
"Yeah," said the writer dryly. 
"How fortunate! Distillery Mars, 
my concern, small but interesting, 
happens to be preparing a new run 
of Mars liquor, 120 proof-— we 



should be so honored if you could 
make a point of sampling our little 
effort, shall we say this afternoon? 
I have comfortable — " a sidelong 
glance at Tonv — "transportation 
here." 

"Maybe later." 

"To a connoisseur of your eminence, of course, we should think it 
a privilege to offer you an honorarium — " 

"Maybe later, maybe not," 
grunted the writer. 

Chabri e r on! y sh rugged and 
smiled; the gunthcr could say no 
wrong. ' 'You will perhaps be 
pleased to accept a small sample of 
the product of Mars Distillery ?" 
The little man held up a gaudily 
wrapped package. He pressed the 
gift into Graham's indifferent grasp, 
wrung Tony's hand warmly, said 
heartily, "We will look forward to 
see you soon," and departed. 

HalHday of Mars Machine Tool 
was n ext. H i s man ner was more 
that of a man inviting a guest to 
his country club, but he did mention that MMT would, of course, 
expect to provide for a writer's 
necessary expenses. Graham cut off 
Halliday's bluff assurances as curtly 
as he had stopped Chabrier' s outpourings.- It was like that all the 
way. 

Everybody who was anybody 
on Mars was in town ithat day, and 
each of them managed to happen 
on the Sun Lake crowd somewhere 
along the road from the spaceport 
to the landing strip.

THOSE who met Tony at any 
time in the past were all determined to stop him for a chat; then 
they noticed Graham, and extended 
a coincidental but warm invitation. 
Those who were unacquainted with 
Sun Lake's doctor were forced to 
be more direct, and the bribe was 
sometimes even more marked than 
Chabricr's or Halliday's offers. 

Graham was cold and even nasty 
to them. But once he took Tony's 
arm and said: "Wait. I see an old 
friend." Commissioner Bell was up 
ahead, striding toward the Administration Building. 

"Him?" asked Tony. 
"Yeah, Hey, Commish!" 
Bell stopped as if lie had been 
shot. He turned slowly toward Graham, and stood his ground as the 
writer approached. When he spoke, 
there was cold hatred in his voice. 
"Just the company I'd expect you to 
keep, Graham. Stay out of trouble. 
I'm the man in charge here, and 
don't think I'm afraid of you." 

"You weren't the last time," said 
Graham, "That was your big mistake — Commish." 

Bell walked away without another word. 

"You shot his blood pressure up 
about 20 millimeters," said Tony. 
"What's it all about?" 

"1 claim a little credit for sending Bell to Mars, Doc. I caught him 
with his fingers in the till up to his 
Shoulder, .it a time when his political fences were down, if you don't 
mind a mixed metaphor. I couldn't 



get him jailed, but I'll bet up here 
he sometimes wishes I had." 

A wild hope flared in Tony. Tiic 

This Is man was, sporad ically, 
known as a crusader. Perhaps Graham's annoyance at the crude plays 
for attention meant that an appeal 
could be made on the basis of decency and fair play. 

ii 

BY THE time they reached the 
plane, Tad was already on the 
spot with the portable health lab 
stowed away, and Bca was warming 
up the motors. 

"Hi!" she stuck jicr head out of 
the cockpit to grin at Tony. "Got 
everybody? Tad, hand out parkas to 
these people. Tony, they tell me 
you're a hero— had it out with big. 
bad Brenner in real style!" She 
didn't quite say: "I never thought 
you had it in you." 

"Things get around, don't they? 
Bca, this is Douglas Graham. He's 
coming out to have a look at Sun 
Lake for a book he's doing. This is 
Bea Juarez," he told the writer. 
"She's our pilot." 

Graham surveyed Bea. "I hope 
everything in the Colony looks as 
good." 

"We'll be extra-careful to show 
you only the best," she retorted. 
" I Icy, Tad, get that mink-lined 
parka, will you? We've got a guest 
to impress." 

Tony was delighted. If everyone 
else in the Colony could take the 



116 




 



Great Man in stride so easily, he 
would be pleased and very much 
surprised. 

Tad came running up -with a 
parka. "What kind did you say you 
wanted? This is the only one .left, 
except Dr. Tony's." 

The three adults burst into laughter, and Tad retreated, red-faced. 

Graham called him back. "I'm 
going to need that thing if the 
temperature in the cockpit doesn't 
go up." 

"You're going to need it anyhow," Tony assured him. "There's 
a lot to be said for Lazy Girl here, 
but she's not one hundred per cent 
airtight." 

"I get the idea," the journalist 
assured him. "You people don't 
throw heat around, do you?" 

"Not heat or anything else," replied Tony. "You'll see, if you can 
stick it out." 

"What the hell, I was a war correspondent in Asia!" 

■ "This isn't a war. There isn't 
anything exciting to make up for 
the discomfort- — except, say, when 
I baby gets born — " 

"No? I take it there was something going on just a little while 
ago. What were you saying about 
the doctor being a hero?" he called 
forward to Bea. 

She shrugged. "All I know is 
what I hear on the grapevine." 

Tony heaved a mental sigh of 
relief — too soon. 

"I was there." Tad had stuck 
right by them. "This man Mr. 



Brenner came over and asked Dr. 
Tony to come work for him, and 
he wouldn't, and he tried to get 
him with a whole lot of money, but 
he still wouldn't, and — " 

«TTOLD on," Graham inter XJL rupted. "First thing you 
have to learn if you're going to be 
a reporter is to get your pronouns 
straight. This Brenner was doing 
the offering, and Doc was refusing; 
that right?" 

"Sure. That was what I was saying—" 

"Look, Tad, we were only kidding about impressing Mr. Graham," Tony said quickly. "You 
don't have to make a hero out of 
me. I just had a disagreement with 
someone," he said to Graham, "and 
they're trying to make a good story 
out of it." 

"That's what J'm after," Graham 
came back, "a good story. Tell me 
everything that happened. Tad." 

The. boy looked doubtfully from 
the doctor to the guest and back 
again. 

"A^l right," Tony gave in. "But 
let's not make a 15 -round fight out 
of it, Tad. Tell it just the way it 
happened, if you've got to tell it." 

"Just exactly?" 

"Yes," the doctor said firmly, 
"just the way it happened." 

"Okay." Tad was far from disappointed. If anything, he was gleeful. "So this Mr. Brenner wanted 
Dr. Tony to come work at his place, 
curing people from drugs, and he 



MARS CHILD 



wouldn't, and Mr. Brenner kept 
pestering him till he, got mad, and 
lie said lie didn't like him and 
wouldn't work for him no matter 
what — I mean, Dr. Tony said that 
to Mr. Brenner — and Mr. Brenner 
'got real mad, and started to swing 
at him, and — " 

"Well, don't stop twiv," Graham 
said. "Who won?" 

"Well . . . then Mr. Brenner 
started swinging and— t stuck my 
foot out and tripped him, and Mr. 
Chabrier came over right away and 
said how wonderful it was the way 
Dr. Tony had socked Mr. Brenner, 
and I guess that's what everybody 
thought.'' He looked up at Tony's 
astonished face, and finished defensively, "Well, you said to tell it 
just the way it happened." 

CHAPTER TWELVE 

TONY fastened the hood of his 
parka more tightly around his 
head, as the chill air of flight crept 
into the cabin. Graham, beside him, 
was full of flip comment and curiosity, to which ordinary decency, let 
alone special diplomacy, denlanded 
reply. But Tony shifted position 
and let his eyelids drop closed. 

There was no mental eye to close 
and so thrust out the revised memory of the ridiculous incident with 
Brenner, nor any mental ear that 
could turn off the resounding echo 
of Bea Juarez' hilarity. 

You knew nil dlong you never 
bit Brenner, didn't you? he asked 



himself angrily. You tordd bate 
figured it out for yourself — // yon 
ttwited to! AH tight, /ben, don't 
think about that. 

The new colonists . . . he ought 
to do something about them, something to dispel the tense, apprehensive silence in the cabin. A 
speech of welcome, something like 
that. 

Thank them for coming? Welcome them to Sun Lake? With the 
threat that hung over them all, new 
members and -old, any speech like 
that would be ridiculous. Later in 
the day, they would be asked to 
sign final papers, turning over, once 
and for all, the funds they had 
already placed in the hands of the 
trustees on Earth, and receiving 
their full shares in the Colony. Before then they would learn the 
worst; they would be told about the 
»C< nation that might doom the 
Colony. But how could he tell them 
now, before they bad ever seen 
Sun Lalcc, before they had glimpsed 
the spellbinding stretches of LaCUS 
Solts, or had a chance to understand the promise implicit in the 
Lab's shining walls, in Joe Gracey's 
neatly laid out experimental fields? 

And in front of the gunthcr, too, 
how much could he say, how much 
did he dare to say? Graham could 
wreck their hopes with a word— or 
solve their problems as easily, jf he 
chose. Graham had exposed the 
Commissioner's corruptness once; 
he wasn't always just a gunthcr; hewas a part-time crusader. Possibly, 




 



he would understand Sun Lake's 
desperate necessity . . . possibly? 

"Oh, by the way," the writer was 
saying. "I've been wondering what 
kind of a checkup you have on 
these people for security." 

"Security?" For a minute the 
word didn't make sense; Tony realized suddenly that he hadn't even 
heard the word for a year; not, at 
least, with that sinister, special 
meaning. 

"Don't you investigate the newcomers' backgrounds?" 

"The Sun Lake Society — the recruiting office — checks on their 
employment records and . their 
schooling to see that we don't get 
any romantic phonies masquerading 
as engineers and agronomists. That 
and plenty of health checks afe all 
we need. The office wouldn't have 
time for more, anyway. It handles 
all the Earthsidc paperwork on our 
imports and exports, advertises, interviews, writes letters to the papers 
when that damn fool free-love story 
pops up again — " He gave Graham 
a look. 

"All right," laughed the writer. 
"I'll make a mental rioter Sun Lake 
doesn't believe in sex." 

TONY was ruefully aware that a 
comeback was expected of him, 
but he substituted a feebly appreciative smile and leaned back, tiredly letting his eyelids drop again, in 
an effort to simulate sleep. 

Through slitted eyes, he studied 
the new arrivals. They were 



crouched on the cabin floor, bundled into their parkas, talking only 
occasionally. Even Tad, at the far 
end of the cabin with the Jenkins' 
children, was low-voiced and restrained. Tony could see him pulling miraculous Martian treasures 
from, his pockets for display, then 
pouncing on the few Earth items 
the new children had to show in return, cautiously pulled forth from 
supposedly empty pockets, and held 
for view in a half-cupped hand. * 

Near them, Bessie Jenkins, the 
mother of the two youngsters, sat 
half watching them, half talking to 
the mousier of the two single girls 
. . . Dantuono? Rose Dantuono, 
■that was it." Anita Skelly, her v*ivid 
red hair concealed under the hood 
of her parka, was carrying on a 
conversation in monosyllables with 
Bob Prentiss; they seemed to be 
communicating a good deal more 
by hand pressure than by word of 
mouth. A shipboard romance,' Tony 
wondered, or had they known each 
other back on Earth ? 

He shifted his gaze to the other 
side of the cabin, where the remaining three men sat: Arnold 
Jenkins, the lanky Bond, and young 
Zarctsky. They were lined up in a 
silent row, leaning against the bulkhead, evidencing none of the interested enthusiasm one might have 
expected. His own depression, the 
doctor realized, was affecting everyone. 

What could he say to them ? 
Here they were, newly escaped 



MARS CHILD 



119 



from Earth, from a madhouse with 
a time bomb in the basement. It 
had cost each one of them more 
than he could estimate, in courage,, 
in money, in work, to make the 
escape — and what could he promise 
them now? 

With luck, with the help from 
Graham, with all the breaks, the 
best they could look forward to was 
the everyday life of the Colony: 
working like dogs, living like ants, 
because it was the only way to pull 
free of the doomed world from 
which they had fled. At worst, and 
the worst was imminent — back on 
the same rocket, or the next, or the 
one after that, back with all the 
others, destitute. Back to Earth, 
will* no money, no job, no place to 
live, and no hope at all. 
"Tony." 

It was Graham again. 
"Yes?" 

"It just occurred to me. Do you 
people charge for guest privileges? 
I'll be happy to shell out anything 
you think is reasonable. Sun Lake 
looks like a good story to me, and I 
want to stay on top of it." _ 

"It hasn't come up before," Tony 
told him. "That means we'll haveto vote on it. Personally, I'd vote 
for charging you." 

"That's the idea! If I roast you 
in the book, you can say I was sore 
because you soaked me. If I give 
you a good report, you can prove it 
wasn't bought and paid for. Right." 

"You're too shrewd for us Marti. in peasants, Graham. I was only 



thinking that we could use the 
money." 

"Doc!" Bca yelled back into the 
cabin. "Radio!" 

TONY got up and leaned over 
into the cockpit to accept the 
earphones Bca passed him. 

"I can only spark a message 
back," she told him. "We didn't 
load the voice transmitter this 
trip." 

He nodded. Through the phones 
a self-consciously important teenage voice was saying: "Sun Lake to 
Lazy Girl, Dr. Hellman. Sun Lake 
to Lazy Girl, Dr. Hellman. Sun 
Lake—" 

"Lazy Girl to Sun Lake, I read 
you, Hellman," he said and Bca's 
hand sputtered it out on the key. 

"Sun Lake to Lazy Girl, I read 
you — uh — seventy-two at Pittco, 
can Lazy Girl sixteen Pittco, over." 

"Dr. Tony to Jimmy Holloway," 
he dictated, "cut out the numbers 
game, Jimmy, and tell me what 
you want, over." 

The teen-age voice was hurt. 
"Sun Lake to Lazy Girl, medical 
emergency at Pittco Camp, can Lazy 
Girl change course and land at 
Pittco, over." 

"Lazy Girl to Sun Lake, wilco, 
Jimmy, but where's -O'Reilly, over." 

"Sun Lake to Lazy Girl, I don't 
know. Dr. Tony. They messaged us 
that O'Reilly wasn't due back from 
Marsport all day, over." 

''Lazy Girl to Sun Lake, we'll 
take care of' it, Jimmy, out." He 



1 20 




 



passed the phone back to Bea. 
"Somebody's sick or hurt at Pittco. 
Drop me off there and I'll get back 
on one of their half-tracks." 

"Right." Bea pulled out her map 
table. 

The doctor went to the rear of 
the cabin where Tad had stowed 
the portable lab. He came back 
with a box of OxEn pills, and 
stood in the doorway between the 
cabin and the cockpit, facing the 
assembled group. 

"These are the same pills you 
took on board, the rocket this morning," he told them. "1 don't think 
1 have to warn you always to keep a 
few with you. Wherever you go, 
whatever you do, as long as you're 
on Mars, don't forget that it's literally as much as your life is worth if 
you don't take one of these every 
twenty-jour hours." They all knew 
that, of course; but there was no 
harm in impressing them with it 
again. 

There was more he should say, 
but he didn't know what. He chose 
the next best alternative and sat 
down. 

"What's cooking ?'* demanded 
Graham. 

"Somebody sick or something at 
the Pittco outfit across the hills 
from our place. Their doctor's still 
in Marsport." 

"Mind if I stick with you? I'd 
like to have a look at the place anyhow — -when they're not ready for 
me." 

Tony considered a moment, and 



decided he liked the idea. "Sure. 
Come along." 

"I'd kind of like to see that girl 
who was for Pittco." 

"You met her -on the rocket?" 

"I met her, all right, but shegave me a faster freeze than your 
girl pilot here. What is she anyhow 
— -a lady engineer? All brains and 
no bounce ?" 

"Not exactly," Tony said. "I 
guess she figured she was on vacation. She's a new recruit for the 
company brothel. Those are the 
only women they've got at Pittco." 

"Well, I'll be damned!" Graham 
was silent a moment, then added 
thoughtfully, "No wonder she 
wasn't interested!" 

ii 

T AZY GIRL touched down at 
' Pittco near noon. The doctor 
and writer were met by Hackenberg, the mine boss, who drove out 
in a jeep as Bea zoomed her ship 
off over the hills to home. 

"I think you're too late, Doc," he 
said. 

"We'll see. Hack Hackenbcrg, 
Douglas Graham." They climbed in 
and the jeep rolled past the smokestacks of the refining plant, toward 
the huts of the settlement. 

"Hell of a thing," grumbled 
Hackenberg. "Nobody's here. Madame Rose, Doc O'Reilly, Mr. Reynolds, all off at Marsport. God 
knows when they're coming back. 
Douglas Graham, did you say? You 



MARS CHILD 



12T 



the reporter Mr. Reynolds was 
going to bring back? How'd you 
happen to come in with the doc?" 

"I'm the reporter," Graham said, 
"but it's the first I knew about coming lure with Reynolds. Did he tell 
you that?" 

"Maybe he just said he hoped 
you would. I don't know. I got my 
hands full as it is. 1 got a contract 
to be mine boss; everybody takes 
off and Big Ginny gets her chest 
busted up, the girls go nuts, and I 
take- the raj), What a life!" 

"Was there a brawl?" asked the 
doctor. 

"Nobody told me — they yanked 
me out of B plant. They found Big 
Ginny over by the hills. She was all 
messed up — you know what I mean, 
Doc, They thought she was raped. 
Rape Big Ginny, for God's sake! 
It ain't reasonable!" 

"They vioved her?" 

"They took her back to (Rose's. 
I tell them and tell them to leave 
'em lay, just get 'em warm, give 
plasma, and wait for a doctor. It 
dort't do any good. First thing they 
think of whenever anybody gets 
smashed up is he don't look -neat 
enough, so they yank him around to 
lie nice and straight and they yank 
him up so they can got a pillow 
under his head and then they haul 
him like a sack of meal to a bed. 
I hope to hell I never have a cavein here with these dummies. Back 
in Jo'burg it happened to inc. A 
timber fell and broke my leg nice 
and clean. By the time all my 



friends were through taking care of 
me and getting me comfortable, it 
was a compound complicated fracture with bone splinters from my 
ankles on up." 

The jeep, stopped in ^ront of a 
large house, .solidly constructed of 
the expensive native glass brick. 
Unlike most of the jerry-built 
shacks that Housed the temporary 
workers in the camp, it was one of 
the few buildings put up by the 
Company itself, and few expenses 
had been spared. 

The door opened hesitantly, and 
a girl peered out, then opened it all 
the way. "Hello, Hack. Is this the 
doctor?" . , 

She wa's dressed in neither the 
standard tunic of most Marswomen 
nor the gaudy clothes of her sisterhood on Earth; instead she wore 
tailored house-pajamas of Earthside 
synvclvet. She might have been any 
business woman or middle-class 
housewife answering her door back 
on Earth. 

"Hello, Maiy." Hackenberg 
turned to Tony. "Doc Hellman, 
this is Mary'Simms. She's in charge 
when Rose U out. Mary, this is 
Douglas Graham, the famous guffther." He stressed the last word 
only slightly. "You've heard of 
him?" 

"Oh, yes." : She was distantly polite. "How ■ (io you do, Doctor ? 
Won't. you come in?" 

"I'll have to take off now." Hackenberg shook Graham's hand vigorously. "Glad to have met you. 



122 




 




MARS CHILD 



123 



I'll pick you up later, Doc." He 
waved and headed back for the 
jeep. Tony and Graham followed 
Mary Simms indoors and pulled 
off their parkas. 




IHE whole house was heated, 
the doctor noticed. 



The girl led them through a 
large and rather formal parlor and 
into a smaller sitting room. She 
crossed the small room, and opened 
a door on the far side. 

"In here, Doctor," she said. 
Tony stepped into the small bedroom, and heard Graham 'right behind him. 

"How about me?" demanded the. 
writer. 

The girl's voice was icy. "Professional courtesy, I suppose; we tire 
in the same business, aren't we? By 
all means, come in." 

The doctor turned his smile in 
the other direction. A huge blonde 
lay on the bed between fresh sheets. 
She was in coma, or . . . 

"Out !" Tony said firmly, and 
closed the door on both of them. 

He lifted the sheet and swore 
under his breath. Big Ginny had 
been washed and dressed in a rosebud-trimmed pink niron nightgown. Few people 'with internal injuries could survive such first-aid. 
He opened his bag and began the 
examination. 

He stepped into the parlor. Mary 
rose from her chair to question 
him, but Tony forestalled her. 
"She's dead." He added in a puz
124 



zlcd voice, "Her chest was beaten 
in. Who found her?" 

"Two of the men. Shall I get 
them ?" 

"Please. And — was there anything they found nearby?" 

"Yes. I'll bring it." The girl 
went out. 

"How about the rape?" Graham 
asked. 

"She wasn't," Tony said. 

He dropped into a chair and 
tried to think it out. The woman 
had been pregnant, and there were 
signs of a fresh try -at abortion — the 
"rape." Was [he father known ? 
Had they tried to abort it? Had 
there been a scene and a fatal beating out there by the hills? How did 
you know who was the -father of a 
child conceived in a place like this? 
And who else would have any reason for the violence? 

Mary Simms came in and said, "I 
passed the word for the men." She 
moved coolly so that her body was 
between Graham and the doctor, 
and handed over something 
wrapped in a handkerchief. "They 
found this." 

"Did you know she was six 
months pregnant?" 

"Big Ginny?" she asked, amazed. 

"Why not?" 

"Why, I've seen her medical 
card, and she's been here two years. 
She was married a couple of times 
on Earth — " The girl was flustered. 

"Well?" 

"Well, it surprised me, that's 

231." 


 



He went into the small bedroom 
and unwrapped the object she had 
given him. It was a stained scrap of 
stout copper wire, about twentyfive centimeters long. Thai confirmed his diagnosis: attempted 
self -abortion, clumsy and dangerous 
because of the woman's bulk and 
probably hazy knowledge of anatomy. But the innumerable blows on 
her chest and back didn't make 
sense . . , 

BACK in the parlor, two men 
in miners' leathers were waiting. The writer was questioning 
them idly about living conditions 
in the camp. 

"I'm Dr. Hellman from Sun 
Lake," Tony said. "I want to ask 
you about finding Big Ginny." 

"Hell, Doc," said one of die 
■miners, "we just walked over that 
way and there she was. I said to 
Sam, It's Big Ginny] Jeez!' and he 
said, 'Some cheapskate musta hit 
her on the head,' and we tried to 
bring her around, but she wouldn't 
conic to, so we made her Comf ortable and wc went and told 
Mary and then we went back on 
shift." 

"That's all there is to it," said 
the other miner. "But it wasn't one 
of our boys. You ask me, it was one 
of those Communist crackpots from 
over your place, all the time reading- — it drives you nuts, did you 
know that? How is the old bag, 
Doc? Is she yelling for her money?" 

"She's dead," the doctor said 



shortly. "Thanks for the Information." 

"You ask me," the miner repeated stoutly, "it's one of those 
Communists did it." 

"Can you beat that?" the other 
one said softly. "What kind of guy 
would kill a dame like that?" They 
went out soberly. 

"Those guys were a little too innocent," said Graham suddenly. 
"Didn't you think so?" 

"I know what that's about," said 
Mary Simms. "They didn't mention 
why they happened to be out strolling on the desert. They're gowheads. They were picking up some 
marcaine. They have a deal worked 
out with one of the people from 
Brenner's Hop Heaven. He steals 
the stuff from Brenner and leaves 
it under a rock for Sam and Oscar. 
They leave money." 

"I knew something was sour 
about them," said Graham brood ingly. "What do we do now, 
Tony?" 

"I'm going to write a note to 
Dr. O'Reilly and see if I can get 
Hackenberg to drive us to Sun 
Lake." He sat down and took out 
his notebook and pen, found a 
blank page, and carefully recorded, 
what he had seen, without adding 
any of his conclusions. 

He signed his name, folded and 
handed the sheet to Mary Simms. 
"When you give the doctor diis," 
he said, "please tell him 1 was sorry 
I couldn't stay to see him. We're 
having big times over at our place. 



MARS CHILD 



125 



Ten new colonists." He smiled. 
"Nine immigrants and a new 
baby." 

"Boy or girl ?" she asked, with 
sudden interest. "How is it — all 
right? Was it hard?" 

"A boy. Condition fair. Normal 
delivery." 

"That's nice," she said, with a 
musing smile. Then she was all 
business again. "Thank you for 
coming, Doctor. I tan make some 
coffee for you while you're waiting 
for Mr. Hackenberg. We have real 
coffee, you know." 

"I didn't know," he told Jier. 
"I'll take two cups." 

iii 

DR. TONY filled Hackenberg 
in on the jeep ride to Sun 
Lake. The mine boss profanely said 
nothing like that had ever happened before and he'd get the nogood swamper that did it and swing 
him from the gantry if he had to 
beat up every leatherhead in camp. 
He told some grisly stories about 
how he had administered rough 
justice to native coal miners in Johannesburg. 

" 'Course," he admitted, "you 
can't do that to Panamericans." 

It's a good thing, thought Dr. 
Tony, that there wasn't any Martian 
animal life. An intelligent race 
capable of being sweated would 
really have got the works from 
Hackenberg, who could justify 
abominable cruelty to his brothers 



on the grounds that they'd been 
born in a different hemisphere of 
his own planet. God only knew 
what he would think justified by an 
extra eye or a set of tentacles. 

Hackenbcxg took the wide swing 
through the gap in the hills and 
highballed the dozen miles to Sun 
Lake City. He came to a cowboy 
stop in front of the Lab and declined their hospitality. 

"I have to get back before the 
big shots," he said. "Thanks, Doc. 
I'll see you around." 

CHAPTER THIRTEEN 

THE big main hall of the Lab 
was jammed with people, 
standing in earnest groups, strolling 
around, all talking at once. As the 
door slammed behind the doctor 
and the writer, <he hubbub quieted, 
and seventy-odd pairs of eyes 
turned on the newcomers. 

"Quite a delegation," Graham 
commented. "For me?" 

"I don't know," Tony confessed. 
He searched the room, and saw 
Harve Stillman break away from a 
small group and head their way. 

"Hi, Tony, did you bring a 
friend ?" 

He turned to find Mimi Jonathan 
it his elbow. 

"Oh, Mimi, this is Douglas Graham. Did Bea tell you he was coming? Graham, Mimi Jonathan. Mi 
— Mrs. Jonathan is the Lab Administrator, in charge Of making 
the wheels go round. And this is

I Lirve Stillimn. Harvc used to 
be . . 

"... a newspaperman himself," 
Graham finished. 

"Nope," Harve grinned. "A 
radioteletype repairman with the 
LP." 

"What a switch!" Graham smiled 
back and shook the other man's 
hand. 

Tony turned from them to ask 
Mimi urgently: "How's it going? 
Did you finish up with the Lab 
search yet?" 

"Afraid so. It's the same as the 
huts. Nothing turned up," she said 
harshly. "We'll have to check the 
shipping crates." 

"Lord!" breathed Tony. 

"Maybe it won't be so bad," 
Stillman ventured. "I've just given 
this crowd a briefing on handling 
hot stuff. Mimi seems to think we 
can clear it up in a day or two if 
we all pitch in." 

"Provided," Mimi added, "we 
all work just a little harder than 
possible. I'm sorry you had to come 
to us at such a busy time, Mr. Graham. I hope you won't mind if we 
don't fuss over you too much. 
You're welcome to wander around 
and ask all the questions you want. 
Everyone will be glad to help you." 

"It will be a welcome change," 
he assured her. 

TONY waited very impatiently 
through a few more minutes 
of polite talk. As soon as Harve engaged the writer's attention again, 



the doctor turned back to Muni. 
"What's the plan?" he asked. 

"Five crews to get out about a 
kilometer into the desert, a halfkilometer apart. Everybody else 
brings them crates one at a time, 
they open and search, repack before 
the next one comes in. No conlamination from crates standing 
open. Through all this you and 
Harvc run back and forth checking 
the handling crews and the tote 
crews to see that they don't get 
danger doses and remove and treat 
them if they do. We figure four 
days to finish the job." 

"Harve, do you think you're 
good enough to monitor the un packing sites?" Tony asked. "Contamination from the native radioactives would be as bad as getting 
our own radiophosphorus into our 
radiomethyline blue." 

"I didn't want to go out and try 
it on my own. Do you think I can 
swing it?" 

"Sure. Go pick us five of the 
coolest spots on Mars." 

The technician headed for the 
racked counters. 

"Doc, can you let me in on that 
cryptic business?" demanded Graham. 

"In a minute," said Tony, his 
eyes wandering over the crowd. 
"Excuse me." He had spotted 
Anna and was starting her way 
when she turned, saw him and approached. 

"We tried another feeding with 
the Kandro baby," she began with

127 



out a preamble, "but he didn't take 
to it — choked it up again like yesterday." 

Tony took out his pipe- and bit 
abstractedly on the scarred stem. 
"No difference ? No change at 
' all?" 

"Not that I could sec. Tony, 
what's wrong with that baby?" 

The doctor shook his head unhappily. "I don't know," he admitted. 

There was Something damnably 
wrong with the Kandro baby, something lie couldn't quite figure. 
There was a clue somewhere in the 
vividly remembered picture of the 
gasping, rcd-taced infant, choking 
and spluttering on a mouthful of 
milk. Should he have tried water 
instead of normal feeding to get 
those scrambled reflexes into order? 

"Doc — •' said Graham. 

"1*11 be with you in a minute." 

Anna went on Serenely: "No 
trouble with Joan. I gave her her 
regular shot and changed the bandages when Tad told mc you'd be 
late. She seemed fairly comfortable." 

"Good. Miscellaneous complaints ?" 

"Kroll in engineering had a 
headache. And there's Mrs. Series. 
Her husband came and asked if 
there was anything I could do— 
they had a quarrel and he thought 
she went into a fit. It was a temper 
tantrum; I know you said not to 
give her anything, but John was 



so upset I gave her sedation to 
quiet her." She turned to Graham. 
"Sorry to have to drag out our hospital horrors. I'm sure you understand." 

"Oh," said Tony, "I'm sorry. 
Douglas Graham, Anna Witleudorf. Excuse me a minute, will 
you?" Mimi was tapping her foot, 
waiting lor an opening. He told 
her: "I better get the afternoon 
.safety done right now, and I'm 
damned if I'm going to do it with 
the whole Colony lurching around 
the Lab. Get 'em out of here so I 
can go to work, will you? Graham. 
I can answer questions while I go 
through the Lab looking for overlevel radiation. If you want to comealong, you're welcome." 

He led the writer out of the 
office into the dressing room, as 
Mimi began to break up the knots 
of non-Lab personnel who had 
shown up to thrash out the search 
plan and learn their own parts in it. 

ii 

TONY helped Graham into the 
suit of protective armor. He 
didn't usually bother with it himself on the afternoon inspection, 
when other people were all over 
the Lab, unprotected. In the morning it was different; the elaborate 
precautions of the outer-door locker 
were necessary when a hot spot had, 
possibly, had time to chain overnight. But while work was actually 
going on, nothing very hot could 



128 




 



develop without being noticed. The 
late check was primarily for the 
purpose of insuring the absence of 
the hot spots that could develop 
overnight. 

The doctor started his meandering course through the Lab, with 
Graham in tow. 

"I'm making the second of our 
twice-a-day safety checks for excess 
radioactivity. It happens that we've 
got to unpack all our material 
scheduled for export, examine it 
and repack it in a hurry if we want 
to get it aboard the outgoing rocket 
in time to get credit to pay our 
bills." 

"Just routine, I suppose?" asked 
'Graham blandly. 

"I think you gathered that it certainly isn't. The fact is, your 
friend, Commissioner Bell, has accused us of harboring a thief and 
his loot — a hundred kilos of marcaine. We've searched everybody 
and everything so far except the 
export crates; now we've got to 
search them." 

"Why not tell the old windbag 
to go blow?" / 

"If we don't turn up the marcainc, he can seal us up for six 
months to conduct an inch-by-inch 
search." 

"What's so dreadful about mat?" 
Graham asked. 

"We're geared to two ships in 
six months now instead of one ship 
a year. If we missed two shipments, 
both incoming and outgoing, we'd 
be ruined." 



GRAHAM grunted thoughtfully, 
and Tony waited — and Waited 
— the grunt was all. He'd been 
half-hoping the writer would volunteer to help— perhaps by picking 
up his anti-Bell crusade or by promising to see his powerful friends, 
or by exposing the sorry mess to 
the public. But Graham, apparently forgetting the Bell business entirely, pitched the doctor a ferocious 
scries of questions that threatened 
to stretch out the inspection endlessly: 

"What's in this box? Why isn't 
this conveyor shielded? Where's 
the stock room ? What do you do 
here ? Is it technical or trade school 
stuff? Where did this soil come 
from? What did you pay for it? 
Tile on this floor, concrete on that 
— why?. Who's in charge here? 
How many hours does he work? 
That many? Why ? How many 
hours does he work?" 

As Tony paraded solemnly back 
and forth with the counter, checking off items on his report, he 
pressed a little on the writer. 

"This crate here," he said, "is 
a typical sale. Radiophosphorus for 
cancer research. It goes to the Leukemia Foundation in San Francisco. 
It's a tracclcss pure — better than 
nine-nines. We're in business because we can supply that kind of 
thing. On Earth they'd have to first 
make the traceless-pure phosphorus 
and then expose it to a reactor or 
a particle accelerator, and the extra 
step there usually means it gets con


MARS CHILD 



129 



Laminated and has to be refined 
again: Here we just produce phosphorus by the standard methods 
and it is radioactive because the 
whole planet's got it. Not enough 
to present a health problem any 
more than cosmic rays on Earth do, 
but damned convenient for Sun 
Lake." 

"Some crate," commented the 
writer. 

"Lead, air gaps, built-in counter 
with a loud alarm. It's the law. 
Normally, we have five per cent of 
our manpower working in the shipping department. Now we have to 
unpack and recratc all this stuff in 
less than four days." ^ 

"Yoo. people should have a 
lobby," suggested Graham. "If 
something like that was handicapping Pitted they'd get rid of it 
quick. Arc we just about through?" 

"Just about," said Tony flatly. 
So much for that, be thought; at 
least he'd given the writer an eyeful of the safety precautions they 
observed, and made him sweat a 
little under the heavy suit at the 
same time. 

In the cleanup room they stripped 
and showered, with Graham chortling suddenly: "O'Mally was a 
prophet ! My first city editor — he 
said when I got rich I'd install hot 
and cold running Scotch in my 
bathroom!" 

"Sorry we only have cold, and 
don't drink this stuff unless you 
want to go blind. It's methyl." 
"Can't be worse than the stuff I 



used to guzzle in Philly," Graham 
said blandly, but he stepped out 
quickly enough and followed the 
doctor's advice about a lanolin rubdown afterward. 

"Dinner time now," said Tony, 
buttoning on his tunic. "Mess 
hall's here in the Lab. Only building big enough." 

"Synthetics?" asked Graham. 

"No, that's not the Sun Lake 
ielea. We want to get on an agricultural cycle as fast as we can. Sun 
Lake has to be able to live on vegetables that grow naturally, without 
any fertilization except our own 
waste products. Naturally we're 
strong on beans, kudzu, yams, goobers — any of the n i t ro get) - fi xi n g 
plants that contain some natural 
protein. You'll see.-" 

GRAHAM saw, he tasted, he expectorated. Into the shocked 
silence of the half-dozen at the 
table, he muttered an embarrassed 
apology and manfully choked down 
almost half of his vegetable plateMars beans, barley, stewed greens 
and another kind of stewed greens. 

To Tony he muttered when conversation had sprung up again : 
"But why do they taste like a hospital smells? Do you have to disinfect them or something ?" 

Joe Gracey overheard it from the 
other side of the table. "That's my 
department," he said. "No, it isn't 
disinfectant. What you and most 
other people don't realize is that 
wc with our Lab are pikers com

pared with the lowliest cabbage in 
synthesizing chemicals. We taste 
the chemicals in our Earth plants 
and we accept them as the way they 
ought to taste. These are unfamiliar 
because these are Mars plants modified so that their chemicals aren't 
poison to Earth animals, or Earth 
plants modified so that Mars soil 
isn't poison to them. We're still 
breeding on this barley, which is 
generating too much iodoform for 
me to be really happy. If I can 
knock one carbon out of the ring — 
but you don't care about that. Just 
be glad wc didn't try out the latest 
generation, of our cauliflower on 
you instead of our test mice. The 
cauliflower, I'm sorry to say, generates prussic acid." 

"Stick with those mice!" said 
Graham with a greenish smile. 

"Only guaranteed -Earth animals 
on Mars, including you," said 
Madge Cassidy, beside Graham. He 
watched her wonderingiy as she 
finished her barley with apparent 
enjoyment. 

"How was that again?" 

"My mice. The only animals on 
Mars guaranteed non-mutated. Wc 
have them behind tons of concrete 
and lead with remote feeding. It'd 
be no joke if some of the natural 
Mars . radioactivity or some of the 
stuff flying around the Lab mutated 
them so they'd gobble Mars food 
that was still poison to people." 

"You mean I might go back to 
Earth and have a two-headed 
baby?" 



"It's possible," said Madge, getting to work on variety number one 
of stewed greens. "Odds are somewhat higher than it happening from 
cosmic rays or industrial radioactivity on Earth. But mouse generations go by so fast that with them 
it's a risk we can't take. Some of 
the pork-and-beaners died very unpleasant deaths when they tried eating Mars plants as a last resort. It 
was the last resort, all right." 

"But isn't anything on Mars 
good to eat?" 

"A couple of items," Gracey told 
him. "Stuff that would probably be 
poisonous to any native animal life, 
if there was any. You find the same 
kind of thing on Earth— plants that 
don't seem to be good for anything 
in their native environment. My 
theory is that the ancestors of poison ivy and other such things aren't 
really Earth plants at all, but came 
to Earth, maybe as spores aboard 
meteorites. We need a broader explanation of the development of 
life than the current theories offer. 
We've grown a giant barley here, 
for instance, out of transplanted 
Earth stock, but it wouldn't be viable there. The gene was lethal on 
Earth. Here — " 

HE RATTLED on, to the accompaniment of Graham's nods 
of agreement, until Harvc Stillman 
broke in: "Hey, there was a rumor 
through the radio relay today. You 
know about it, Mr. Graham?" 
"Doug," the writer corrected. 



MARS CHILD 



131 



"Okay," Harve smiled. "About 
rnarcaine— no, not about us," he 
added hastily. "About rnarcaine being forbidden in Tartary. The Cham 
pronounced a. rescript or whatever 
it is, and according to the guys in 
Marsport that means the price goes 
up, and Brenner's business is doubled. Do you know anything about 
it, Doug?" 

The newsman looked surprised. 
"It was all over the ship," he told 
them. "-Everybody was talking 
about it. How come you don't get 
it till now? The radio op on board 
told me he spilled it in his first 
message to PAC." 

"It's true then?" Gracey asked 
sharply. 

"I wouldn't know. I'm only a 
reporter myself." He looked across 
to Tony. "Don't tell me Marsport 
wasn't buzzing with it. Brenner, 
knew, didn't he?" 

"No," the doctor said slowly. "I 
didn't hear anything about it 
there . . ." iBut he had heard of a 
rumor; who was it? Chabrier! Of 
course, that was Chabrier's rumor: 
rnarcaine prices going up, production will double, Brenner needs a 
new plant, needs a doctor, too . . . 
. Tony stood up abruptly. "Excuse 
me. Gracey, are you finished ? Want 
to come along?" 

The agronomist rose quickly, 
and the two left together. On the 
way to collect Nick and go over to 
the Jonathans', Tony explained the 
situation rapidly to Gracey. 

"I wanted to get the Council to


gether tonight anyhow," he finished 
up, "to tell you about my idiotic 
brawl with Brenner. I don't know 
what kind of jam lhai's going lo 
land lis in. Rut this business ties 
in with what Chabrier told me. 
Rocket to Bell and Bell to Brenner, 
and the rest of us can get the news 
whenever the Commissioner gets 
around to it!" 

"It makes a nasty picture," the 
agronomist agreed soberly. "Now 
what? Where do we go from 
here?" 

"Damned if I know. Maybe one 
of the others can figure it." He 
knocked sharply on Nick's door. 

CHAPTER FOURTEEN . 

«TT DOESN'T matter," Mimi 
X said firmly. "We still have to 
go through with the search." 

"That's how I see it, too," Tony 
admitted. "We can't bring any accusations until we know our own 
slate is clean." 

"If we could only get hold of 
the Bloodhound . . ." 

"Bell refused." 

"And that means no matter how 
carefully we search, he can still 
come in afterward and claim it 
wasn't done properly." 

"Could we rent one or buy it?" 
Gracey wanted to know. 

"Government property only," 
Mimi told him. "O'Donnell 
checked on that the other day." 

"Okay, so we have to do it 
without the Bloodhound." Nick

jumped up ami paced the length of 
the room restlessly. "I bet I could 
build one if wc only had a little 
time . . Well, wc have to go 
ahead, that's all. Where does Graham come in?" 

r I TONY realized they were waiting 
JL for an answer from him. "I 
don't know. He has no use for 
Roll, hut he doesn't exactly rise to 
the bait when I throw it at him 
cither. 1 think we better go slow 
and feel him out. tie didn't seem 
to go for the blunt approach when 
Chabrier and the others tried it." 

' 'Slow ?" Nick stormed. "Man, 
we've got six days ! Go slow?" 

"As fast as we can," Gracey put 
in. "Wc still have to get the search 
finished. I think we have to do that 
before we ask Graham anything. 
He has to have some facts to work 
with." 

"Right,'' Mimi agreed. "Now 
let's get our plans organized. If wc 
start at dawn, maybe we can do the 
whole unpacking operation tomorrow . . . then we can hit Graham. 
Means we'll have to leave crates 
open and repack them later, but I 
don't sec any alternative now. How 
long is Graham staying, Tony?" 

"He said maybe three days." 

"Okay, then that's how we've 
got to do it. Maybe by tomorrow 
night we'll know better how to get 
at the guy." 

They spent a busy ten minutes 
outlining the plan of operations, 
and then the three men went out, 



leaving the details for Mimi to 
settle. 

Tony walked down the settlement street slowly, trying to get his 
thoughts in order. It had been a 
long day — three-fifteen in the morning when Tad woke him, and now 
there was still work to do. 

Stopping in at the hospital to 
collect his bag, he found Graham 
kibitzing idly with Harvc in his 
living room. 

"Just waiting for you, Doc." 
Stillman stood up. "I have to get 
over to the radio shack. Tad's on 
the p.m. shift this week, but he 
fell asleep before supper, so I've 
got to take over tonight." 

Tony surveyed his guest uncomfortably. "Anything you'd like?" 
he asked. "I have to go out and sec 
a couple of patients. Won't be too 
long." 

"Could I go along?" Graham 
asked. "I'd like to, if it's all right 
with you." 

"Sure. I want you to sec the 
baby I was talking about anyhow. 
My other patient is pretty sick; you 
may have to wait while I look in 
on her." 

They stopped at the Radi. UfFs 
lirsl. but Joan was asleep and she 
usually got so little rest that Tony 
decided not to disturb her. Anna 
had said she'd had a fairly good 
day. He'd see her tomorrow. 

"Where is this infant?" Graham 
asked as they walked down the 
Colony street. 

"Here. This is the Kandros'

place. Hello, Polly," Tony said .is 
the door opened, even before he 
knocked. "I brought Mr. Graham 
along to visit. I hope you don't 
mind." 

"I . . . no, of course not. How 
do you do? Come in, won't you?" 
Her manner was absurdly formal, 
and her appearance was alarming. 
Tony wondered when she had last 
slept. Her eyes were over alert, her 
lips too tight, her neck and shoulders stiff with tension. 

"How's Sunny?" He walked into 
the new room where the crib stood, 
and the others followed. He wished 
now that he hadn't brought Graham along. 

"The same," Polly told him. "I 
just tried. You see?" 

THE baby in its basket was sputtering feebly, its face flushed 
bright red. We're going to lose that 
youngster, thought the doctor grimly, unless 1 start intravenous feeding, and soon. 

"Tell me something, please, Doctor," she burst out, ignoring the 
reporter's presence. "Could it be 
my fault? I'm anxious — I know 
that. Could that be why Sunny 
doesn't eat right?" 

Tony considered. "Yes, to a degree, but it couldn't account for all 
the trouble. Are you really so tense? 
What's it all about?" 

"You know how it was with us," 
she said evasively. "We tried so 
many times on Earth. And then 
here we thought at first it'd be like 



all the other times, but, Tony, do 
you think — is Mars dangerous?" 

He saw she'd changed her mind 
in mid -confess ion and substituted 
the inane question for whatever she 
had started to ask. He intended to 
get to the bottom of it. 

Over the woman's shoulder, he 
looked meaningfully at Graham. 
The reporter grimaced, shrugged, 
and obligingly drifted back to the 
living room. 

Tony lowered his voice and told 
the woman: "Of course Mars is 
dangerous. It's dangerous now; it 
was dangerous before you had 
Sunny. I'm a little surprised at you, 
Polly. Some women think that having a baby ought to change the 
world into a pink spun-candy 
heaven. It doesn't. You've had 
Sunny; he's a small animal and you 
love him and he needs your care, 
but Mars is still what it always was. 
The terrain's rugged and some of 
the people aren't what they ought 
to be. But . . ." 

"Tell me about the murder," she 
said flatly. 

"Oh, is that what you're jumpy 
about ? I saw worse every night I 
rode the meat wag- rode the ambulance at Massachusetts General. 
What's that got to do with Sunny?" 

"I don't know. I'm afraid. Tell 
me about it, Doctor, please." 

He wondered what vague notion 
of terror she had got stuck in her 
head — and wondered whether it 
would come out. 

"You're the doctor," he said, 



134 




 



shrugging. "The girl who got killed 
was named Big Ginny, as you may 
have heard. If you'd been on the 
wagon with me in boston, you'd 
know there's nothing unusual about 
it. Women like that often get beaten 
up, sometimes beaten to death by 
their customers. The customers are 
usually drunk, sometimes full of 
dope; they get the idea that they're 
being cheated and they slug the 
girl. Another call for the wagon.*' 

"1 heard," she said, "thatshewas 
beaten to death with a lot of light 
blows. No man would do that. And 
I heard that Nick Cantrella saw 
footprints out by the caves — naked 
footprints. He thought they were 
children's." 

"Whose do you think they 
were?" he asked, though he had a 
sickly feeling that he knew what 
she'd say. 

POLLY moaned, "It was brownies ! I fold you I saw one and 
you didn't believe me! Now they've 
killed this woman and they're leaving footprints around and you still 
don't believe me! You think I'm 
crazy ! You all think I'm crazy ! 
They want my baby and you won't 
listen to me!" 

Tony thought he knew what was 
going on in her head and he didn't 
like it. She had seen the attention 
of the Colony shift from her baby 
to the rnarcaine search, and was 
determined to bring it back, even 
if it had to be by a ridiculous ruse. 
She'd heard all the foolish stories 



about the mythical brownies; she'd 
had a vivid anxiety dream — which, 
he reminded himself', she had finally 
admitted was only a dream—and 
now she was collecting "evidence" 
to build herself up as the interesting victim of a malignant persecution. 

"We've been over all this before," he told her wearily. "You 
agreed that you didn't really see 
anything. And you agreed that 
there couldn't be any brownies because no animal life has ever been 
found on Mars — no brownies, and 
nothing brownies could evolve 
from. Now . . ." 

"Doctor," she broke in, "I've got 
to show you something." She 
reached into the baby's basket and 
drew out something that glinted 
darkly in her hand. 

"Good Lord, what are you doing 
with a gun?" the doctor demanded. 

There was no more conflict on 
her face or hesitancy in her voice. 
"You can say I'm crazy, Tony, but 
I'm afraid. I think there could be 
such things as brownies. And I'm 
going to be ready for them if they 
come." She looked at the little 
weapon tensely and then put it back 
under the pad in the crib. 

Tony p romptl y d rew it out. 
"Now listen, Polly, if you want to 
believe in brownies or ghosts or 
Santa Claus, that's your business. 
But you certainly should know better than to leave the gun near him. 
I'm going to give you a sedative, 
Polly, and maybe after a good—" 



MARS CHILD 



135 



"No," she said. "No sedative. 
I'll be all Eight. But can I keep the 
gun?" 

She wiped her eyes and, with an 
effort, laid her twitching hands 
quietly in her lap. 

"If you know how to use it and 
keep the safety on and put it some 
place besides under Sunny's mattress, I don't see why not. But all 
the brownies you'll ever shoot with 
it you could stick in your eye and 
never notice." 

"Like the old lady, maybe 1 
don't believe in ghosts but I'm terribly afraid of them?" She tried to 
laugh and Tony managed a smile 
with her. 

"Nothing wrong with blowing 
your top once in a while. Nothing 
at all. Women ought to bawl 
oftener." 

She grinned weakly and said: 

"Maybe Sunny's going to eat 
better now." 

"I hope so. I'll see you tomorrow, Polly." 

ii 

AS THEY walked down the 
street in a strained, embarrassed silence, Graham looked as if 
he wanted to ask something. He 
finally did: "By the way, Tony, do 
you know where I'm supposed to 
sleep? Or where I'd find my bag? 
It was on the plane." 

"Might as well stay with me, 
And your baggage ought to be at 
the Campbells. Tad Campbell was 



that young sprout who deflated my 
fight with Brenner." 

The baggage, a sizable B--1 bag 
on which Graham must have paid a 
ruinous overweight charge, was at 
the Campbells. After picking it up, 
the writer followed the doctor to 
his hospital-hut. 

Tony snapped a heat beam on 
the two plastic chairs — standard 
furnishings of a Sun Lake living 
room — and took off his sandbobts 
with a grunt. Graham rooted 
through his 'baggage, picked up 
Chabrier's gaudy package and 
hefted it thoughtfully, then shook 
his head and dove in again. He 
came up grinning, with another 
bottle. 

"How about it. Doc?" he asked. 
"1 1 1 is is Earthside." 

"It's been a long time," Tony 
sighed. "I'll get a couple of 
glasses." 

The stuff went down like silken 
fire. It had been a very long time. 

"What's about brownies?" the 
writer asked suddenly. "I couldn't 
help hearing part of that when I 
went out of the room." 

Tony shook his head. "BrowJi/esf 
As if we didn't have enough trouble here, without inventing Martian 
monsters ... ." 

"Well, what about them? All 
I've ever heard is that deep purple 
scene in Granata's interplanetary 
show. It's silly stuff, but nobody's 
handled it yet at all except Granata. 
Maybe I could use something; it's a 
beautiful story if there's anything 



136 




 



at all to back it up. Does anybody 
claim a connection between fairy 
book brownies and the Martian 
variety?" 

"Two ways. First of all, Mars 
brownies are just as much a fairy 
story as the Earthside kind. Second, 
somebody once suggested that the 
ones in the story books were the 
space traveling ancestors of the 
present-day hallucinations."* 

"Could be," the gunther reflected. "Could be . . ." 

"Could be a lot of rot," Tony 
said without heat. "Space travel inquires at an absolute minimum the 
presence of animal life — or at least 
mobile, intelligent life. Show me 
so much, as one perambulating vegetable cm Mars, let alone a native 
animal life-form. Then it's likely 
I'll think about brownies some 
more." 

"How about a declining race?" 
Graham speculated. "Suppose they 
were space travelers, on a high level 
of civilization — they might have 
killed off all lesser life-forms. You 
see it happening some on Earth, 
and back there it's just a matter of 
living-space. We don't have the 
problem the Martians had to face, 
of dwindling water an d oxygen 
supplies. Probably got them in the 
end, and destroyed their civilization . . . except," he added, "for 
the ones who got to Earth. I understand from authoritative sources 
that the last expedition to Earth 
was led by a guy named Oberon." 
Graham chuckled and drank, then 



asked seriously: "Has anybody ever 
seen one, except Granata?" 

"Hundreds of people," Tony 
said drily. "Ask any one of the old 
prospectors who come into town 
hauling dirt. They've all seen 'em, 
lived with 'cm; some even claim to 
have been at baby-feasts. You'll get 
all the stories you want out of any 
of the old geezers." 

"What are brownies supposed to 
look like?" the writer insisted. 

TONY sighed and surrendered, 
recognizing the same intense 
manner Graham had displayed in 
the Lab. The man was a reporter, 
after all. It was his business to ask 
questions. Tony gave him what he 
wanted, with additions, explanations, and embellishments. 

Brownies : an intelligent lifeform, either animal or mobile vegetable. About a meter and a half 
in height; big ears; skinny arms. 
Supposed to be the naked remnants 
of a once-proud Martian civilization. (Except that there were no 
other remnants to support the 
theory.) In the habit of kidnaping 
human children (except that there 
was no specific authenticated case 
of a baby's disappearance) and eating them (except .that that seemed 
too pat and inevitable an idea-association with the kidnaping — the 
sort of additional embellishment 
that no good liar could resist). 

"It's an old prospectors' yarn," 
Tony wound up. "The homesteaders picked it up to frighten kids 



MARS CHILD 



137 



into sticking close to home. There 
are hundreds of people on Mars 
today who'll tell you they've seen 
brownies. But not only is there no 
native animal life of any kind on 
Mars today — so far as we can tell, 
there never has been. No ruins, no 
old cities, no signs of civilization, 
and not so much as one single dessuated dricd-out scrap of anything 
resembling an animal fossil." 

"That's strictly negative evidence," Graham pointed out. He 
emptied his glass, and poured another drink for both of them. "Cigarct?" 

Tony shook his head. "I gave up 
smoking long ago. We all quit 
sooner or later. Too much trouble 
to keep tobacco burning." He 
reached out to pick up his empty 
pipe from the table beside him, and 
he clenched the stem comfortably 
between his teeth. 

Graham repeated; "Strictly negative evidence. But on the other side 
you have footprints, for instance, 
and eyewitness stories." 

"If you're talking about the cataract-covered eyes of old Marsmcn," 
Tony retorted, "don't call it evidence." 

"It wouldn't be," Graham agreed, 
"except that there are so many of 
them. I'm beginning to think 
there's a story in il after all." 

"You mean you believe it?" the 
doctor demanded. 

"Do I look crazy? I said it was a 
story." 

"So you came 150 million kilom


eters on a rocket, and then four 
more hours across Mars in a beatup old rattletrap of a plane," the 
doctor said bitterly. "You eat food 
that tastes like hospital disinfectant, 
and live in a mud hut, all so you 
can go back home and write a nice 
piece of fiction about brownies — a 
piece you could have dashed off 
without ever leaving Earth!" 

"Not exactly," the gunthcr said 
mildly. "I was only thinking of using the brownies for one chapter. 
Local color, tales and legends — that 
kind of thing." 

"You could get plenty of stories 
back on Earth," Tony went on bitterly. "Stories worth writing. How 
about Paul Rosen's story? There's a 
real one for you." 

"Rosen?" Graham leaned forward, interested again. "Seems to 
me I've heard the name before. 
Who was he?" 

"Not was. Is. He's still alive; a 
cripple nobody knows." 

<*fllELL me about Rosen." The 
-L writer tilled their glasses 
again. 

"I'll tell you about Mars; it's the 
same story . You came to w rile i 
book about Mars, didn't you? Well, 
Mars — this Mars, without oxygen 
masks — is Rosen's work. Rosen's 
lungs. And you never heard of 
him . . . Rosen was the medical 
doctor aboard the relief ship, the 
one thai found what was left of the 
first colony. He had a notion about 
the oxygen differential, was con


138 




 



viaeed that it wasn't responsible for 
the ^failure. He was wrong, of 
course, but he was right, too. To 
prove his point he took off his 
mask and found he didn't need it. 

"His assistant tried it, and nearly 
died of anoxemia. That proved 
some people could take Mars 
straight and others couldn't. When 
the ship got back Rosen went to the 
biochem boys with his lungs. They 
told him a few c.c. wouldn't be 
enough to work with, so he volunteered for an operation. Most of his 
lung tissue was removed. He was 
crippled for life, but they tracked 
down the enzyme that made the 
difference, and worked out a test." 

"That I remember," said Graham, continuing to fill the glasses 
almost rhythmically. "Half the guys 
I met in Asia claimed they enlisted 
because they weren't Marsworthy 
and life wasn't worth living if they 
couldn't go to Mars." 

«f| "1H AT was the beginning of 
-1- it," Tony said. "The ones 
who passed the test began to come 
over. Thousand dollars a day prospecting, and always the chance of 
finding bonanzas. At first they were 
pork-and-beaners, but the Mars 
vegetation they brought back took 
us one step closer to fitting into the 
Martian ecology. The biochem boys 
came up with a one-shot hormone 
treatment to stimulate secretion of 
an enzyme from the lining of the 
pylorus. It's present in most people 
without the shot, but not enough 



to break down the Martian equivalent of carbohydrates into simple 
sugars which the human body can 
handle. You asked mc before what 
all the shots you got on board the 
rocket ship were for. That's one 
of them. It means you can handle 
the Mars plants which don't contain compounds poisonous to Earth 
animals. 

"The other shots you got were 
to protect you against all the rest 
of the things that killed off the 
first pork-and-beaners — fungi, ultra-violet damage to the eyes, 
dehydration, viruses. For every shot 
you got, half a dozen of the first 
explorers and prospectors were 
killed or crippled to find the cause 
and cure. 

"Five years ago came the payoff. 
The biochem boys got what they'd 
been looking for ever since they 
first sliced up Rosen's trick lungs. 
They synthesized the enzyme, your 
little pink OxEn pill, and that did 
it. That's when the Sun Lake Society was founded; and the new 
rocket fuel two years ago made Sun 
Lake a reality: With OxEn and 
four trips a year, we can make out 
until we find a way to get along 
without Earth. 

"Sun Lake is Mars, Graham. 
Sun Lake's all's gonna be left when 
you crazy bastards back on Earth 
blow yourselves up. The other 
colonists here aren't Mars; they're 
part of Earth. When Earth goes, 
they go. Sun Lake's all's gonna be 
left . . ." 



MARS CHILD

"Coupla catches/' said Graham, 
trying to make a glass stay put so 
he could fill it. "Commish Bell and 
his eviction notice. And you still 
need OxEn. Can you make that inna 
Lab?" 

"Not yet, " ' Tony brooded . He 
had forgotten the lovely optimism 
that could be poured out of a bottle. 
"Guess I had 'nough to drink. I 
have a hell of a day ahead of me." 

CHAPTER FIFTEEN 

A HELL of a day it was. It started, for one thing, with a 
hangover. Tony heaved himself" out 
of bed, glad to find Graham still 



asleep. He didn't want any cheerful conversation just yet. He prescribed, dispensed, and self-administered some aspirin, used an extra 
cup of water for a second cup of 
"coffee," finally decided he was 
strong enough to face the reek of 
methyl alcohol, and got washed. 

Mimi Jonathan was in charge at 
the Lab when he got there. Law or 
no law, he raced through the A.M. 
Lab check to get ahead on the awful job of monitoring the unpacking operation. He rode out on a 
bike to the five spots Stillman had 
selected for the inspection crews 
and found them reasonably low in 
radioactivity. 



140 




 



Sheets of plastic had been laid 
down lor flooring and tent walls 
were going up, with little tunnels 
through which the crates could be 
passed without the handlers bringing in all the dust of Mars on their 
feet. Blowers were rigged to change 
the air between each inspection and 
radiologitally clean overalls would 
be passed in at the same time. 

A little after dawn, the careful 
frenzy was in full swing. A crew in 
the shipping room eased out crates 
and passed them to wrappers who 
covered them with plastic sheeting 
and heat-sealed them. Aboard skids, 
the crates were manhandled up the 
slight slope from the "canal" bed to 



the tents in the desert, unwrapped, 
passed in, opened, searched, 
checked for chemical and radiological contamination, sealed and 
passed out again. Back at the Lab, 
they would be wrapped in lead 
sheets pending recrating and stored 
separately in every workroom that 
could be spared. 

jMimi was everywhere, ordering 
a speedup on the heat-sealing, or a 
slowdown on the bucket- brigade 
manhandling, routing crates to the 
station that would soonest be free, 
demanding more plastic sheeting, 
drafting a woman to wash more 
coveralls when a stand of them 
toppled over. The few Lab proccs


MARS CHILD 



>41 



scs that wouldn't be left alone were 
tended under the direction of Sam 
Flexner, by people from agro and 
administration, and by specialized 
workers like Anna Willcndorf. 

Tony and Harve Stillman moved 
constantly up and down the line, 
back to the Lab and out to the 
desert, checking persons, places and 
materials. Before noon Tony had 
the bitter job of telling Mimi: 
"We've got* to abandon the Number Two tent. It's warming up. 
Radioactivity's low on the site, but 
it's from something that chains 
with the plastic flooring, I don't 
know what. Another hour and 
radiation from the flooring will 
contaminate the crates." 

The woman set her jaw and 
picked another crew from the line 
to set up a tent on another monitored site. 

Somebody slipped in the Number 
Three tent, and Harve Stillman 
found some of the Leukemia Foundation's shipment of radiophosphorus had got from the inside of 
the crate to the outside — enough to 
warrant refusal by the rocket supercargo in the interests of the 
safety of the ship. 

But never a trace of marcaine did 
the search crews find. 

LUNCH was at noon, carried 
about by Colony children. 
Gulping cool "coffee," Tony told 
Harve Stillman : "You'll have to 
take it alone for a while. I haven't 
visited my patients yet. I missed 



Joan Radcliff altogether yesterday." 

"Hell, I don't know whe-ther I'm 
coming or going," grunted Stillman, then added, "I guess I can 
manage." 

"Send for me if there's anything 
you really can't handle." Tony 
started back toward the street of 
huts before a new emergency could 
delay him. 

He stopped at his own house 
to pick up his medical bag, and 
found, Graham awake, at work in 
front of an old-fashioned portable 
typewriter. Another surprise from 
the gunther; Tony had assumed the 
man worked with a dictatyper. Even 
in the Colony they had those. 

Graham looked up pleasantly and 
nodded. "Somebody waiting for 
you in the other room, Tony." He 
motioned with his head toward the 
door that led to the hospital. "You 
going out again?" 

The doctor nodded. "I don't 
know when I'll get back. You can 
walk around and ask questions 
wherever you find anybody. You 
understand the situation here — we 
can't let up on this marcaine business even for the press," 

"Sure." The gunther nodded, 
unperturbed. 

"I'll get around in time to pick 
you up for supper anyhow," Tony 
promised. "Did you get any 
lunch ?" 

"I managed." Graham grinned 
and pointed to an open can still 
half full of meat, and a box of 



142 




 



hard crackers. "Look," said the 
writer, "Unless you've lost your 
Earthside tastes completely, why 
don't you have supper on me to-night ? There's lots more where 
lunch came from." 

"Thanks. I might lake you up 
on that." 

Tony went into the hospital, 
where Edgar Kroll was waiting for 
him. 

"Sorry to bother you today, 
Doc," Kroll apologized. "I came 
over on the chance you'd be around 
right about now. Another one of 
those damned headaches; I couldn't 
get any work done at all this morning, Guess I'm just getting old." 

"Old !" Tony snorted. "Man, 
even in Sun Lake, you're not old at 
thirty-five! Not just because you 
need bifocals. You've stalled around 
long enough now . . ." And heaven 
only knew what boudoir tauntings 
from young Jeanne Kroll lay behind that, Tony thought, as he 
reached into the dispensary cabinet. 
"Here's some aspirin for now. If 
you come around tomorrow, I think 
I'll have time to refract you; I just 
can't manage it today. Take the 
afternoon off if the headache 
doesn't go away." 

HE GOT his black bag, and 
walked down the street with 
Edgar, as far as the Kandros' place. 
At the door, he bumped into Jim, 
just leaving for the Lab, after 
lunch. 

"Glad I saw you. Doc." The 



new lather stood hesitantly in the 
doorway, waiting till Kroll was out 
of earshot, then burst out: "Listen, 
Tony, I didn't want to say anything 
in front of Polly, but . . . arc you 
sure it's going to be all right ? 
Sunny still isn't eating. Maybe it's 
cancer or something! I heard of 
something like that with one of our 
neighbor's kids back in Toledo — " 

Just— just exactly the sort of 
thing that made Tony almost blind 
with rage. He liked the man; Jim 
Kandro was his brother, his comrade in the Colony, but — ! With 
his pulse hammering, he made it 
clear to Jim in a few icy sentences 
that he had studied long, sacrificed 
much and worked hard to learn 
what he could about medicine, and 
that when he wanted a snap diagnosis from a layman he would ask 
for one. Jim and Polly could yank 
him out of bed at three in the 
morning, they could make him minister to (heir natural anxieties, but 
they could not make him take such 
an insult. 

He stalked into the house, ignoring Jim's protests and apologies 
both, and professional habit took 
over him as he greeted Polly and 
examined the baby. 

"About time for a feeding, isn't 
it?" he asked. "Is it going any 
better? Since last night, I mean? 
Want to try him now while I observe?" 

"It's a little better, I guess." 
Polly smiled doubtfully and picked 
up the baby. She moved the plastic 



MARS CHILD 



143 



cup of the oxygen, mask up a little 
over the small nose, and put Sunny 
to her breast. 

To Tony, it was plain that "the 
infant was frantic with hunger. 
Then why didn't H nurse properly? 
Instead of closing over the nipple, 
Sunny' s mouth pushed at it onesidedly, first to the right, then to 
the left, any way but the proper 
way. For seconds at a time the baby 
did suck, then would release the 
nipple, choking. - m 

"He's doing a little better," said 
Polly. "He's doing much better!"' 

"That's fine!" Tony agreed feebly. 'Til be on my way, then. Be 
sure to call me if there's anything." 

HE WALKED down the Colony 
street wishing a doctor could 
afford the luxury of shaking his 
head in bewilderment. Maybe it 
was all straightening out. But 
what could account for the infant's 
fantastic behavior? There's nothing 
so determined as a baby wanting 
to feed — but something was getting in the way of Sunny's instinct. 

He hoped Polly realized that 
Sunny would feed sooner or later, 
that the choking reflex which frustrated, the sucking reflex would disappear before long. He hoped she 
would reali2e it; he hoped desperately that it would happen. 

Joan Radclifr was next and this 
time he found her awake. She was 
no better and no worse; the enigmatic course of her nameless disease had leveled off. All he could 



do was talk a while, go through 
the pulse-taking and temperaturereading mumbo-jumbo, change the 
dressings on her sores, talk some 
more, and then go out. 

Now Dorothy, the sinus case, 
and he was done with his more 
serious cases for today. 

Tanya Beyles had a green sick 
card on her door, but he decided 
to ignore it. He was already past 
the house when she called his name, 
and he turned to find her beckoning from the opened door. 

She had dressed up to beat the 
band — an absurdly tight tunic to 
show off her passable thirty-plus 
figure, carefully done hair and the 
first lipstick he remembered seeing 
around in months. 

"I don't have much time, today, 
Mrs. Beyles," he said carefully. 
"Could it wait till tomorrow?" 

"Oh, please, Doctor," she 
begged, and launched into a typical 
hypochondriac resume of symptoms, complete with medical terms 
inaccurately used. What it boiled 
down to was that a thorough examination was in order though there 
was nothing nasty wrong with her. 

"Very well," he said. "If you'll 
come over to the hospital — next 
week, perhaps — when I have more 
time." With a chaperone, he added 
silently. 

"Wouldn't it be just as easy here, 
and more private?" she ventured 
shyly, indicating the bedroom, 
where a heat lamp was already focused on the made bed. 



144 




 



"Dear God," he muttered, and 
found the professional restraint that 
had taken over while he was with 
Polly Kandro had now quite abandoned him. "Mrs. Beylcs," he said, 
plainly and nastily, "you may not 
realize it, but we do have a sense 
of humor here, even if we don't 
share your ideas of fun. We've been 
able to laugh off your malicious 
gossiping and the lousy job you do 
in Agronomy; you do get some 
work done in Agro, and you don't 
cat too much to keep your shape. 
Up to now, we've been able to 
faugh everything off and hope* 
you'd straighten out. But I warn 
you, if you start being seductive 
around Sun Lake — even if you start 
with me — you'll get shipped out so 
fast you won't . , ." 

"Is that so?" she screamed. 
"Well, maybe you'd like to know 
that I can get all the love and respect I want around here and where 
you got the nasty idea that I'm at 
all interested in you I can't imagine. I've heard of doctors like you 
before and if you think you're going to get away with it you're very 
much mistaken. And don't think I 
don't know all about you and that 
Willendorf woman, f know things 
people would love to hear . . » 

He walked off before she could 
say any more. God only knew what 
they'd do with her — deport her, he 
supposed, and her sad sack of a 
husband would have to go, too, and 
it would all be very messy and badtempered. Maybe Bell and Graham 



and all the others were right, regarding Sun Lakers as anywhere 
from mildly insane to fanatically 

obsessed. 

Maybe anything at all, but liestill had to go to see Dorothy and 
her sinuses. The doctor's fat tal 
muscles fell into their accustomed 
neutrality as he walked into the 
girl's bedroom and his mind automatically picked up the threads of 
the bacitracin story where he had 
left off two days before. 



HALF an hour later, he was back 
at the unpacking and search 
operation where he took over alone 
while Stillman, groggy with the. 
strain, the responsibility and the 
plain hard work, took a short break. 
The two of them divided the job 
then, moving steadily up and down 
the lines, checking, rechecking endlessly until, as darkness closed 
down, they were suddenly aware 
that there were no more crates. 

Mimi Jonathan bitterly enumerated the results of the search : 
"About 1,500 man-hours shot to 
hell, three crates contaminated beyond salvage, nine salvageable for 
umpty-hundrcd more man-hours— 
and no marcainc. Well, nobody can 
say now that we didn't try." She 
turned to Tony. "Your move," she 
said. 

"Graham?" The doctor stood up. 
"All I can do is try to get him on 
our side. He's friendly anyhow; he 



MARS CHILD 



145 



asked me to have supper with him 
out of his private stock of genuine 
synthetic Earthside protein." 

"You don't sound too hopeful," 
Gracey ventured. 

"I'm not. Did 1 tell you what 
his favorite story is so far ? 
Brownies!" 

"You mean he's passing up a 
yarn like the killing at Pitted, and 
he wants to write about Brownies?" 
Nick asked incredulously. 

"You think he's going to step 
on P it tco 's toes ? ' ' Tony retorted . 
"Not that smart boy ! Okay, I 
might as well get back and make 
my try." He started across the 
darkening desert, and Nick fell 
into step beside him. "Why don't 
you conic* along?" the doctor suggested. "Maybe you could talk his 
language better than I do. You 
might get a decent meal out of it, 
too." 

"It's a thought. A good one. 
Only Marian's probably got supper 
all ready by now. I better check in 
at home first. I don't know — would 

you say it was official Council business?" 

"That's between you and your 
hunger,'' the doctor told him. 
"What do you want most — meat or 
Marian ?" 

"Damned if I know," Nick admitted, grinning. 

"Doc!" It was Jim Kandro, running down the street toward them. 
"Hey, Tony! I just came from the 
hospital — looking all over . . ." 

"What's up?" 



"The baby! He's having convulsions." 

"I'll go right over. Pick up my 
bag at the hospital, will you?" 

JIM set off in one direction, and 
Tony in the other. "Sec you 
later," Nick called out to the doctor's rapidly retreating back. 

At the Kandros, he found Polly, 
near-hysterical, with a struggling infant in her arms. Sunny was obviously in acute discomfort; the veins 
were standing out on his fuzzy 
scalp, he was struggling and straining feebly, his belly was distended 
and his checks puffed out uncomfortably. 

How's h e been eating ?' ' the 
doctor demanded, scrubbing his 
hands. 

"The way you saw before," said 
Polly. "Better and better, but just 
the way you saw before, wiggling 
and pushing so half the time he 
was sucking on nothing at all. He 
was crying and crying, so I fed him 
three or four times and each time 
he got more — " 

She fell silent as Tony picked up 
the baby and patted and stroked it. 
It burped loudly. The alarming red 
color faded and the tense limbs relaxed. With a whimper Sunny collapsed on the doctor's shoulder and 
fell asleep before he was back in 
his crib. 

"But you said—" Polly gasped. 
"I guess Sunny didn't hear me," 
Tony said. 

"Here you are, Doc." Jim came 



T46 




 



in and looked from Polly's empty 
arms to the quiescent baby in the 
crib. "I guess you didn't need the 
bag. What was it?" 

"Colic," Tony grinned. "Good, 
old-fashioned, Earthside colic." 

"But you told me . . ." Jim 
turned accusingly on his wife. 

"And I told Polly," Tony put 
in quickly. "It doesn't usually happen. Babies don't have to be burped 
on Mars — most of them, that is. 
The mask feeds richer air into a 
Mars baby's nose so he just naturally breathes through his nose all 
the time and doesn't swallow air 
and get colic when he feeds. But 
I guess Sunny had his heart set on 
a bellyache. Was he crying when 
he fed, Polly?" 

" Why, yes, a little bit. Not really 
crying, a kind of whimper every 
now and then." 

"That could explain it. All right, 
now you know it isn't serious. Just 
be sure to bubble him after feeding. Thank the Lord he's nursing. 
That young man of yours gave us 
all a bad time, but I think we're 
, out of the woods now." 

Sunny was going to be all right; 
for the first time, Tony really believed it. 

Somehow that changed the whole 
dismal picture. 

ijl 

fTlONY entered his own house 
-L and found Graham still sitting 
in front of his typewriter, not writ


ing now, but reading through a 
pile of onionskin pages. 

"Hi. I was waiting for you." The 
journalist looked pleased with himself. "I'll fix us some sandwiches 
if you'll do something about that 
coffee of yours. When you make it, 
it's almost drinkable." 

There was a knock on the door. 

"Come in," Tony called out. 

"Oh, am I busting in on something?" Nick asked innocently. 

"No, of course not. Glad to see 
you. Doug, this is Nick Cantxetta, 
I don't know if you met him before. He's in charge of maintenance 
and equipment in the Lab, and a 
member of our Council. Nick, you 
know who Doug Graham is." 

"Uh-huh. My rival. My wife's 
only true love." 

"And you should see his wife," 
Tony added. 

"This gets more and more interesting. You're not married to 
that lady pilot by any chance?" Graham extended a greasy hand. "No? 
Too bad. Join us? We're eating

"Don't mind if I do. How's the 
baby, Tony ? Any th i ng rea 1 1 y 
wrong?" 

"Yes and no. Colic. Good old 
colic," the doctor gloated. "It 
shouldn't happen, but, by God, it's* 
something I know how to cope 
with; I think the kid's going to be 
all right. Coffee's ready. Where's 
the food?" 

They munched sandwiches, and 
had "coffee" which Graham pro

nounccd a very slight improvement 
over his own efforts. The two Sun 
Lakers were more than happy with 
it; it was sweetened with gratings 
from a brick of sugar produced by 
the gunthcr from his wonderpacked luggage. The same suitcase 
turned out to hold another bottle 
of Earthside liquor, and Graham 
poured drinks all around. 

"It's a celebration," the writer 
insisted, when Tony, remembering 
his hangover, would have demurred. 
"I got a week's work done today. 
Whole first chapter — complete 
draft of the trip out and impressions of Marsport!" He tanned out 
a sheaf of pages covered with 
single-spaced typing, and corked 
the bottle. 

Nick took a long deep swallow, 
settled back blissfully on the bunk 
.where he was sitting. "Marcaine," 
he said at last. "That could explain 
it." 

"What?" 

"I've been sitting here imagining I was eating meat and drinking 
whiskey. Can you beat that?" He 
sipped more slowly this time, savoring the drink, and said determinedly to Graham, "You're just about 
up to Sun Lake in your notes 
then?" 

"That's right," Graham said. In 
the silence that followed, he asked 
brightly: "Say, aren't you the guy 
who saw the brownie tracks." 

"Brownie tracks? Who, me? 
You're sure you weren't thinking 
of unicorns?" 



"Do unicorns leave little footprints?" 

"Oh, that. Yeah, I saw something out around the caves in the 
Rimrock Hills. That's where the 
kids take the goats to graze." 

"Are they allowed to go barefoot around there?" Graham 
asked. 

"Allowed!" Nick exploded. 
"You haven't been ten years old for 
quite a long time, have you? How 
much attention do you think they 

pay?" 

QUITE a bit, Tony thought, remembering his talk with Tad, 
but he didn't bring it up. Out loud 
he said: "I've got a .theory about 
that. I've been thinking about it 
since last night, Doug. Maybe you 
can use it in your book." It wasn't 
smart, maybe, to keep riding the 
writer about it, but he'd had enough 
of brownies for awhile. "I'll tell 
you what I think. I think, some kids 
who weren't supposed to do it went 
exploring in a cave, and one of 
them got lost. Then the rest 
wouldn't admit what happened, and 
all the search party could find was 
kid-sized footprints. So we have 
'brownies'. And a couple of dozen 
rei i red prospectors back on Earth 
are coining money telling lies about 
them," he finished, more sharply 
than he meant to. 

"I guess that squelches me," Graham laughed boisterously, picked 
up his papers, and stood up. "I 
better be getting along. Have to 



148 




 



find out about getting this stuff 
radioed out." He started for the 
door, and almost collided with 
Anna coming in. 

"Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot you had 
company, Tony. They kept me busy 
all day out at the Lab, and I thought 
maybe I could get some work done 
here this evening, but . . ." She 
smiled apologetically at Tony and 
Nick, then turned to Graham. 
"Were you going out?" 

"Shouldn't I?" 

"Of course not/' said Tony. "Not 
when Anna's just come in. Stick 
around, and you'll see something." 

"What does she do?" Graham 
asked. "Song and. dance routine? 
Prestidigitation?" 

Nick said from his perch on the. 
wall bunk: "Graham, if you had 
an ounce of Earthside chivalry in 
your bloodstream, you'd uncork that 
bottle and offer the lady a drink." 

"You're right. I'll even offer you 
one." Tony got another glass, and 
the writer poured. Then he turned 
to Anna, and asked again, "Well, 
what do you do?" 

"I'm a glassblower, that's all. 
Tony 1 ikes to watch it, an d he 
couldn't possibly understand that 
other people might not enjoy it as 
much." 

, "Oh. You do your work over 
here?" 

"Yes," the doctor said testily. 
"Anna is also my assistant, if you 
recall — neither one is a full-time 
job, so she keeps her equipment 
here, and combines the two." 



For a few minutes, the four of 
them sat talking inconsequentially, 
the three Sun Lakers answering 
Graham's endless variety of questions. Finally, Anna got up. 

"If I'm going to get any work 
done, I better get started." She 
opened the cupboards and began 
pulling out equipment. 

' Graham stood up, too. 
"Well . . ." He picked up his sheaf 
of papers . 

"Tony \" 

ALL three men focused their attention on Anna, who stood 
facing them, her arms full of assorted junk. 

"Tony," she said bluntly, "Have 
you told Mr. Graham about our 
problem here? Don't you think he 
might be able to help?" 

"Well!" Graham sat down again, 
and suddenly grinned. "Tell me, 
what can I do for dear old Sun 
Lake?" 

"You can save our necks," Nick 
told him soberly. "At least I think 
you can, if you want to. You're going back on the rocket," he explained, "and that rocket won't 
have our shipment on it, because — 
actually because- — we didn't steal 
some marcaine we're accused of 
stealing. It's not here, so we 
couldn't find it, and that means Bell 
will throw a cordon around us on 
Shipment Day. You know Bell from 
way back. You could raise such a 
stink about what he's doing to us — 
if you wanted to — that there'd be 



MARS CHILD 



149 



orders recalling him to Earth on 
the next rocket that comes in. 
You're big enough to do it. And 
we don't know any other way." 

"You're very flattering," the 
writer said, "and also too damn 
brief. I already know that much. 
Suppose you fill me In on some of 
the details." 

"Bell tramped in three days ago/" 
the doctor began carefully, and 
went through the story, step by 
step, not omitting the information 
he had picked up in Marsport, and 
reminding Graham at the same time 
about the Cham's new regulations 
against ma renin e. 

"Brenner wants to get his hands 
on the Sun Lake Lab," Tony wound 
up. "You got Bell kicked out of a 
good job once for crooked dealing. 
You could do it again, Unless Bell's 
got religion, and I see no sign of 
it, Brenner could easily hire him to 
kick us off Mars and then see that 
Brenner Pharmaceutical got the 
assets of the busted Sun Lake Colony — including the Lab — in a 
rigged auction." 

The writer pondtered, and then 
told them slowly: "I think I can 
do something about it. It's a good 
story, anyhow. The least I can do 
is try." 

Nick let out a wild: "Wa-hoo!" 
and Tony slumped with relief. 
He looked back to Anna's work 
bench, smiling — but she was gone. 

"Now that that's settled," said 
Graham, "I want a favor myself." 

"Up to but not including my 



beautiful blonde wife," promised' 
Nick fervently. 

"If it was women, I'd want that 
lady airplane pilot. But it isn't 
women. I still want to get this stuff 
filed to Marsport by your radio. 
I'm going to have a crowded schedule before takeoff and every minute 
I clip off in advance, like getting 
this stuff typed and microfilmed, 
will help." 

"Sure, pal! Sure!" Nick stood 
up and shook the writer's hand 
earnestly. "I'll take you to the radio 
shack myself and give you the 
blanchest carte you ever saw!" 

CHAPTER SIXTEEN 

It's a It' I Mars baby, 
It's a li'l Mars baby, 
It's it I'll Mars baby, 
Li'l Mars baby 
All — our — own ! 

^TT WAS midnight, and Polly sang 
X her song very softly, so as not 
to awaken Jim. Her hand, on the 
baby's back, caressed the tiny, clearly defined muscles, rigid now with 
concentration of effort. Her eyes 
filled with wonder as she watched 
Sunny nuzzle awkwardly, but successfully, against her breast- - He was eating ! He was swallowing the milk, and not choking on 

, it or spitting it back! 

With a touch of awe at the 
thought that she was the only 
mother on Mars who had the privilege, she laid the baby over her 



ISO 




 



MARS CHILD 



shoulder and gently patted. Sunny 
bubbled and subsided. She laid him 
in the basket and sat watching him 
raptly. Jim rolled over and muttered, 50 she decided not to |Sing 
her song again. She was hungry, 
anyway. She touched her lips to 
the baby's forehead, straightened 
his mathematically straight blanket 
and went to the little pantry cupboard in the living room. 

A dish of left over navy beans 
would settle her for two or three 
more hours of sleep. She found a 
spoon and beg*an to eat, happily. 
She cleaned the dish and licked the 
spoon, put them away and started 
back for bed. 

She was halfway to the bedroom 
door when it happened. 

EVERYTHING went slower and 
slower and came to a stop. She 
was frozen to the floor, giggling — 
and she was also somewhere else, 
watching herself giggle. The reddish walls turned the most beautiful apple-green, her favorite color, 
and put forth vines and branches. 
They were apple tree branches, and 
they began to bear apples that were 
baby's heads— -severed baby's heads, 
dripping rich delicious juice. The 
babies sang her song in a cheeping 
chorus, and she saw and heard herself giggle and sing with them, and 
pluck the heads from the branches, 
open her mouth — 

"Jim!" she shrieked, and it all 
collapsed. 

Her husband stood in the door


way, looked at her and leaped to 
catch her. 

"Get Dr. Tony," she gasped 
after she had vomited and he had 
carried her to a chair. "I think I'm 
going crazy. There were these — get 
Dr. Tony, please, Jim !" 

The thought of being left alone 
horrified her, but she clutched the 
chair arms, afraid to close her eyes 
while he was gone. She counted to 
more than a hundred, lost track and 
was starting again when Jim and 
the doctor burst in. 

"Polly, what is it? What happened ?" 

"I don't know. Doctor, / don't 
know! It's all over now, but I don't 
know if it's going to come back. I 
saw things. I think . . . Tony, I 
think I'm crazy." 

"You threw up," he reminded 
her. "Did you eat anything?" 

"I was hungry after I nursed 
Sunny. I ate some beans-A:old 
beans. And then it was horrible. It 
was like a nightmare, only I was 
watching myself ..." 

"This happened right after you 
ate the beans ?" he demanded. "You 
didn't eat the beans earlier?" 

"No, it was .right after. I fed 
Sunny, and then I ate, and then it 
happened. I was frozen to the floor 
and I watched myself. I was going 
to do something horrible. I was 
going to . i ." She couldn't say it; 
she remembered it too clearly. 

"That's too quick f or food 
poisoning," the doctor said. "You 
froze, you say. And you watched 



152 




 



yourself. And there were hallucinations." 

'"Yes, like the worst nightmare 
in the world, yet I was awake." 

"Stay with her, Jim. I've got to 
get something. Can you clean up 
in here?" 

Jim clenched his wife's hand in 
his big, red fist and then began to 
mop. 

Tony came back with a black box 
they all knew — the electroencephalograph. 

"Look here, Tony," growled 
Kandro. "If you're thinking that 
Polly's a drug addict, you're crazy." 

Tony ignored him and strapped 
the electrodes to the woman's head. 
Three times he took traces, and 
they were identical. Positive brain 
waves. 

"You were full of marcaine," he 
told her .flatly. "Where did you get 
it?" 

"Well, I never — " and "God 
damn it all, Doc — " the couple began simultaneously. 

Tony relaxed. "I don't need a 
lie-detector," he said. "It must have 
been put on the beans. Lord knows 
how or why." 

Polly asked incredulously: "You 
mean people go through that for 
pleasure?" 

"You had the reaction of a wellbalanced person. It's the neurotic 
who enjoys the stuff." 

Polly shook bet head dazedly. 

"But what are we going to do?" 
demanded Jim. 

"First thing is to get some bottles 



and nipples, and goat's milk for 
you. Breast-feeding is out for at 
least the next week, Polly. There'd 
be marcaine in your milk. You 
don't want to wean Sunny now?" 
"Oh, no!" 

Tony jmilcd. "We'll have to get 
a breast pump made, too, to keep 
your supply going. But that can 
wait till morning." 

"But — " protested Jim. 

The doctor swung around to face 
him. "All right, what do yon suggest we do?" 

Jim thought and said hopelessly: 
"I don't know." 

*<"\T EITHER do I. I'm a doctor, 

JLN not a detective. All I can do 
is write a formula for the baby, and 
get people moving right now turning out the stuff you need." 

He stepped into the nursery for 
a moment to peer at Sunny, in the 
crib — a beautiful, healthy child. 
Tony wondered for a moment 
whether Polly's earlier fantasy 
about a menacing brownie had also 
been caused by her food being 
doped. There had been no nausea 
that time, but it might have been 
a smaller dose. 

Time enough later to figure all 
that out; Sunny would be hungry 
again in a few hours. 

"Jim,", he directed, "you better 
beat it over to Anna Willcndorf's 
and tell her we'll need bottles right 
away. And get some milk while 
you're out. If you move fast, we'll 
have time to boil it and make the 



MARS CHILD 



153 



first formula before Sunny wakes 
up again." 

"Milk?" Jim said, dazed. 

"Milk. From one of the goats. 
Don't you know how?" 

"I've milked cows," Kandro said. 
"Couldn't be much different." 

"One other thing," Tony called 
to Jim, who was already at the 
door. "Nipples. Get Bob Carmichael for that. I think he can figure 
out some way . . . make sure he 
checks with Anna on the size." 

"Right." Jim closed the door behind him. 

u 

THEY had the milk boiling on 
the alky stove when Anna arrived with the first bottle. "The 
others are still cooling," she explained. "I'll go buck for them 
later, but I thought you'd need one 
right away." She handed it over, 
went to look down at the calmly 
sleeping baby, and asked Polly, 
"What can I do?" 

"I don't know. Nothing, I guess. 
The doctor's showing me how to 
make formula and I suppose that's 
all there is. It was awfully nice of 
you to get up to make the bottles. 
I feeL terrible about making so 
much trouble, but I just . . ." She 
trailed off helplessly. • 

"It wasn't your fault," Anna told 
her, then asked the doctor: "Do 
you want me to take over with the 
formula?" 

"There's no need to," Tony told 



her. "For that matter, you can go 
back to bed if you want to. There 
shouldn't be any more trouble tonight." 

"I have to go back and get the 
other bottles later anyhow," she 
protested. She took over at the 
stove, showing Polly the simple 
procedures of sterilization and 
measuring involved in the baby's 
formula. 

Jim came back from a second 
trip to the Lab in time to boil up 
one of the new nipples, and fill a 
bottle before Sunny woke. Polly, 
still shaken, but determined to behave normally, picked the baby up 
and changed him, warmed the bottle herself under Anna's watchful 
eye, and settled herself on a chair 
with baby and bottle. 

"You want to make sure the neck 
of the bottle is full of milk," Tony 
told her. "Aside from that, there's 
nothing difficult about it. Don't try 
to force his position. Let him wriggle around just as if he was at the 
■breast." He watched while she 
nudged the new plastic nipple into 
his mouth. "That's right. Fine. I 
think he's going to take it all 
right." 

Sunny sucked hungrily, wriggled, 
pushed his mouth sidewise, and 
then to the other side, sucking all 
the time. Milk spilled out the side 
of his mouth as he sucked without 
swallowing, and turned his reddening face from side to side, 
squirming desperately. 

Tony, suddenly frightened, took 



154 




 



a step forward. He could see the 
trouble clearly enough, but from 
above, looking down at the baby's 
face, Polly couldn't possibly see 
what was happening. 

Sunny was trying to make use of 
the peculiar sidewise suckling he 
had developed at his mother's 
breast, but he couldn't wedge his 
small mouth around the comparatively firm plastic of the new nipple. Tony opened his mouth to 
speak; in a minute the baby 
would . . . 

"Stop it! O-o-h-b slop it! You're 
choking — .'" 

Polly's hand, holding the bottle, 
shot away from the baby's mouth. 
Tony whirled to see Anna crumble 
to the floor, her mouth still open in 
the drawn-out shriek. 

"Jim !" he shouted. "Quick ! 
Take care of her!" Then he turned 
back again without waiting to see 
what Kandro did. He lifted the 
choking, convulsive infant out of 
Polly's limp arms, turned him upside down, and stroked the small 
stiff back vigorously. Within seconds, a thick curd of milk dribbled 
out of the baby's mouth, and the 
terrible gasping sounds turned into 
a low monotonous wailing. 

TONY put the baby back in his 
mother's arms, and turned briefly to look at Anna. Jim had lifted 
her on to the wall bunk. Tony 
checked quickly to make sure she 
hadn't hurt herself. 

"Just fainted," he said, puzzled, 



and gave Kandro instructions to restore consciousness. 

Sunny's wailing was turning into 
a steady, vigorous hunger cry. The 
doctor picked him up again, and 
wrapped him in one of the warm 
new blankets. 

"Where arc you taking Sunny?" 
asked Polly with shrill nervousness. 

"To the hospital." He turned to 
|im, still standing over the unconscious Anna. "Don't let her leave 
when she comes to, Jim. I'll be 
back later." 

He went out, carrying the screaming baby in one arm and his black 
bag in the other. 

The walk back to his own house 
was haunted. The ghost of a newborn baby went with him along the 
curving street in the dark, a ghost 
that gasped and choked as Sunny 
did, twisting in agony until it died 
again as it had already died a thousand thousand times for Tony, only 
the first time was the worst, the 
first baby born and the first one 
dead in Sim Lake, and he'd had to 
watch it all, the ghost of a baby 
that died for want o( air . . . 

He went in by the hospital door. 
He didn't want to sec Graham. 

Systematically, he turned on the 
lights and assembled his instruments in the sterilizer, turned a 
heat lamp on the examination table, 
and stripped off the baby's clothes. 
This couldn't go on; there had to 
be an answer to Sunny's troubles, 
and he was going to find it now, 
tonight. 



MARS CHILD 



Tony examined the child with 
every instrument and technique in 
his repertory. He felt it, probed 
and thumped it, listened to its interior plumbing. He could find 
nothing that resembled organic 
trouble. And be could think of no 
rational explanation for a mask 
baby breathing through its mouth. 

"It's got to be nasal," he said 
out loud. Three Limes he had used 
the otoscope, and three times he 
had found no obstruction. But — 

CAREFULLY, Tony slipped the 
mask off Sunny' s nose. He 
slipped it over the mouth instead, 
stifling its scream in mid-voice. At 
least, he thought grimly, the baby 
would have to breathe through the 
mask now if it wanted to keep on 
crying. The doctor began to probe 
delicately into one nostril, and Sunny 
promptly reacted with the unexpected. Impossible or not, he tried 
to draw a breath through his exposed nostrils, found an impediment and began to choke again. 

Tony withdrew the slender probe 
and stared at the gasping, redfaced infant. For just a moment, a 
clear and frightening picture of the 
other baby blotted out what was be


fore his eyes — the ghost baby that 
had come up the street with them. 
Then he looked at Sunny again and 
everything began to full Into place. 

Sunny was the wrong color. 

He should have been blue and he 
wasn't. He was gasping for air, he 
couldn't breathe; he should have 
been oxygen starved. And be tints 
flushed a bright crimson.' 

It wasn't lack of oxygen, then. It 
was impossible! But it was the only 
logical answer. Tony removed the 
mask from the baby's face with 
trembling hands. 

He wailed. 

It took Sun Lake City Colony 
Kandro less than thirty seconds to 
do what Tony knew he couldn't do 
— and most certainly would do. 
Sunny gasped sharply for a moment. Then this breathing became 
even, his color turned a normal 
healthy pink, and he resumed his 
monotonous hanger cry. 

Sunny didn't need an oxygen 
mask at all to survive on Mars, nor 
did he need OxEn. 

The fact Was scientifically paralyzing . . .. the child was adapted 
not to the rich air of Earth, but the 
deadly thin atmosphere of Mars !
