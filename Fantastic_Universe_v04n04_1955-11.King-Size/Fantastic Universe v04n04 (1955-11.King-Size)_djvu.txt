so 
near

darkness 

by . . . Theodore Sturgeon 



■ Brokaw's guilt and fear seemed more 
than human flesh could endure. But 
Tina could see the ugly bridgework behind the Dark One's fangs. 



This is the story of a Chinese 
silver cigarette case, some vaseline 
hair tonic, a gooseneck desk lamp, 
and two girls— one nearly always 
beautiful* and one always nearly 
beautiful. It also may or may not 
concern a creature called Arrara, so 
named because of its peculiar snarl. 

The girl who was nearly always 
beautiful had been christened Organtina, but when she heard a snide 
and subtle remark about it from one 
of the long-haired gentry in Greenwich Village she determinedly 
omitted the first two syllables. Tina 
was attractive in an almost miraculous way, and struck such a perfect 
balance in the color of her hair between blonde and brunette that one 
can only describe it as being the 
color of hair which is soft in the 
shadows, and breathtakingly bright 
in the sun. 

Tina sold seashells in Chelsea, a 
fact which caused her considerable 
difficulty in describing her occupation whenever she became emotionally agitated. In her colorful little 
shop on the fringes of the Village, 
she displayed seashells and parts of 



// was Theodore Sturgeon's genius for combining fantasy with science fiction, 
in a blend of enchantment rare in out age, which won hint an international 
■FANTASY COMMITTEE AWARD in a year which saw an unprecedented display of 
competitive brilliance on library shelves. Wc doubt, indeed, if there is another 
writer of quite his stature in both genres. And now, for the second time, 
he appears in our pages, will a tale as darkly terrifying and as fraught with 
Nvvembral dheftdness as midnight's frightful liaison with a demon moon.

seashells arranged and assembled 
into dolls, turtles and comedy masks. 

She also conducted a flourishing 
trade in geegaws and a very special 
assortment of bric-a-brac and izthattas. The izthattas differed from 
the geegaws and the bric-a-brac in 
that the latter arc unfunctional but 
pleasing decorative things, whereas 
die izthatta is a purely functional 
object She loved both the izthattas 
and the geegaws and she made them 
as fast as she could. And so accomplished was her artistry that they 
sold like hotcakes. She knew because she had received comparative 
figures on hotcakes from Eddy 
Southworth. 

The merchandising of an izthatta 
is very simple. You make up an object by cementing a razor-shell to a 
sea-snail, crowning it with a clam 
and spraying on some Paris Green. 
Almost certainly the next customer 
in the place will ask: "Is that a napkin ring?" or "Is that a paper 
weight?" or "Is that a salad-fork 
holder?" The correct reply should 
be: "I really like to deal with customers who show both good taste 
and insight. But of course it is! And 
this morning a lady was in — -" 
1 Your next cue is to laugh gaily 
while the customer reaches into her 
jeans for the exorbitant price of the 
izthatta, Chelsea being near enough 
Jo the Village for jeans on ladies to 
be de r'igeur. 

Tina's window displays'- were 
changed weekly, and brought in a 
lot of trade. Now it would be a 
spread of fragile coral-lace and crab


claws, largely labelled: SKELETON 
ART. (No mussels). And next 
week (he display would be a highly 
abstract piece of business all made 
of urchin-quill and mother-of-pearl, 
captivatingly captioned: UNCONCHIOUSART, without, of course, 
a conch in sight. 

In the third week of a warm 
March, Tina was busily working 
with tweezers, cement, Swiss pattern files and a set of surgical tools. 
She worked in a small alcove separated from die rest of the shop by a 
curved partition, with a splendid 
assortment of her wares spread out 
under a gooseneck lamp of high 
voltage. 

The opening in the partition between the workroom and die shop 
was small- — but so was Tina. Her 
knowledge of a customer's advent 
was gained in two ways. Pirst, there 
was the photo-electric beam which 
crossed the outer doorway, in such 
a way that its interruption would 
actuate a mellow chime. Second, 
there was a hole cut through the 
partition. The aperture was at her 
eye-level as she sat at work and it 
enabled her to see clearly everything 
that went on in the shop. 

Imagine, then, her astonishment 
when she looked up from her work 
and saw through the peephole that 
there was a man in her shop. Eddy 
Southworth, whose hobby was electronics, had assured her that no one 
could possibly pass through the 
outer door without breaking the 
photo-electric beam. Yet the chime 
had not rung, and indisputably

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



there was a man in the shop — a 
slender, graceful man with black 
hair like a carapace and heavily 
knitted brows. 

Tina rose quickly, straightened 
her hair and squeezed through the 
partilion. "Yes?" she inquired, confronting the intruder so abruptly 
that he recoiled a step. 

"Yes indeed," said the man. He 
was young, and he had a voice like 
the middle register of an oboe. He 
looked up quickly and back to the 
showcase on which he had been 
leaning, the darting swiftness of his 
glance subtracting nothing from its 
thoroughness. Tina felt like a filedrawer from which inventory cards 
had been quite deliberately spilled. 

"Would — would you like something?" she asked faintly. 

She stepped hopefully behind the 
showcase, but to no avail. He 
promptly turned his back, to gaze 
up and across, down and around 
the shop. 

"The old shell game," he said as 
if in amazement to himself. 

"There was a time," she said 
pltMvutUy, "when I bad only heard 
that once in connection with this 
business, which was founded by my 
grandfather. Is there anything — uh 
— inanimate here which appeals to 
you?" 

■ "Oh yes," he said, turning 
finally to face her. He had, it appeared , d istu rbingly i ronic eyebrows. "Where were you on the 
night of March twenty-fifth, two 
years ago?" 



She stared at him. "Are you serious?" 

"I certainly am," he said soberly, 
"I would really like to know. It's 
difficult for mc to explain, but you 
must believe that it's important to 
me." y 

"I don't think I can — Wait 
now." She tilted back her head and 
closed her eyes. Two years ago. Of 
course. She had been in Rochester, 
and — "I do remember!" she said. 
"It's strange that you should ask me. 
I was staying with an aunt in Rochester that spring, and I had a violent 
quarrel which seems very silly now. 
I was quite the Girl Scout then. I 
was so angry I got my kit and 
headed for the hills. I didn't sec a 
soul I knew for almost two weeks." 

"No one?" He stared at her-intcntly. "Think now. Didn't anybody 
know where you were?" 

"Not a soul," she said positively. 
"And where were you that night, 
if I'm not being too curious? Just 
where, precisely?" 

He smiled a very white smile. 
His teeth seemed to be pointed. "I 
ttm sorry," he apologised. "That 
W«S very rude of me. Would you 
like to make some money?" 

Tina nodded energetically. "By 
selling seashells." 

"I mean real money." 
"How? By selling thousands of 
seashells ?" 

He sighed. "There's one tiling 
I'm sure of," he said. "You are 
being stupid on purpose." 

"I shall take that as a compliment," she said, and added, "I 



SO NEAR TT 

wonder how much more I'll have to 
take." 

He laughed engagingly. "Your 
sense of humor seems to stay with 
you no matter wh.it the provocation. 
I've noticed your window displays, 
for example. Laughing in the face 
of a business recession. You'd probably remain buoyant in the face of 
any menace." 

"You try me," she said without 
inflection, "I rather think you'd be 
surprised." 

The eyebrows tensed like the 
wings of a gliding gull. "Perhaps I 
will." 

"What has my sense of humor to 
do with all this," she asked, meeting his gaze defiantly. 

"More than you might suspect. I 
have a job to do, and I need a girl 
like you to assist me." He straightened, his long face all clear planes 
and forced patience. "Cigarette ?" 

He took a silver cigarette from 
his pocket and offered it to her unopened. 

She stopped her head in midshake and took the case. "What a 
lovely thing!" she exclaimed. 

"Is it?" said the man. 

"Surely there tan be no doubt 
about it. What a beautiful dragon!" 

"There are seven dragons," he 
pointed out. 

"Sev — Oh, I see. Two around the 
edge here, all curled around each 
other. Ulvhuh — and one peeping 
around the pagoda." 

"There are a good many pagodas 
around Pciping, too." 

"Hey!" she laughed. "That was 



H DARKNESS 7 

my line. Now, let's see — that makes 
four dragons." 

"There are two more on the 
back," he murmured. 

She turned the case over. "I don't 
like those. They look positively 
ferocious." 

"They've been fighting again. But 
most dragons do look ferocious." 

She looked at him quizzically. 
His calm, handsome face had 
grown, if anything, more sardonic. 
Recognizing that he was willing to 
let the impossible conversation go 
on until closing time, she dropped 
her eyes to the case. 

"Where's the seventh dragon?" 
she asked, 

Arrara-arrara said the case. It 
spoke softly, like a lisping child 
with moist red Hps. Tina gasped, 
and closed her eyes. The case moved 
gently but firmly in her grasp, just 
as if someone were trying to twist 
it away from her. She trembled and 
opened her eyes. The young man 
was trying to pry it from her fingers. She raised it with a shudder 
of revulsion. 

Arrarei, said the case indignantly. 
The man said, "Shut up, you." 

Tina said, "I didn't say anything." 

"Not you," he said to Tina. "I 
was just thinking aloud, in reference to something else. Cigarette?" 

"Thanks no," said Tina swiftly, 
her eyes on the case in horrified disbelief as it went back into the man's 
pocket. She wet her lips. The other 
dragon's inside, huh?" 

"That's right. Now, about this 



8 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



little job. I can make tt decidedly 
worth your while if you'll come in." 

"I don't doubt that," said Tina, 
moistening her lips. "But if I should 
consider it I'd like to know in advance what it is I may have to say 
'No* to." 

"Well, it's like this. I have a 
friend who wants to get married, in 
a manner of speaking, and you're 
the ideal — Oh, see here now. Stop 
shaking your head like that." 

"I can't help it. That 'in a manner of speaking' just about does it 
Good-bye." 

"Good-bye. My name is Lee 
Brokaw. I'm a dancer — adagio." 

He looked her up and down and 
smiled. "Of course I didn't really 
mean 'good-bye.' I wish you would 
save both of us the trouble involved 
in my becoming insistent," he said 
smoothly. "How about dinner tonight?" 

For reply she marched to the 
doorway and stood there. The 
photocell chime crooned from the 
back of the shop. She threw up a 
firm thumb. "Come along, little 
man. Actually, it's past my customary closing hour." 

As if this were a cue, he nodded 
with feigned resignation and passed 
through the door. "See you tomorrow," he promised. 

Shaking her head, Tina went back 
into the shop. She was sharp-witted 
enough to realize that she must depend for the support of her unusual 
trade on unusual people. Of these 
she certainly bad had more than her 
share, from the gentleman who 



would buy no ornament at which 
his schnauzer would not wag its 
tail, to the woman who had three 
rooms of her house redecorated to 
suit a purple tie-rack she had purchased at a fire sale. But this Lcc 
Brokaw character was strictly eggs 
in the beer. What teas it he kept 
locked up in that cigarette case? 

II f 

TlNA had dinner with Eddy 
Southworth. He w - as an artist who 
lived and worked in the Village, but 
unlike most artists, he put in regular 
hours. He was locally well-known, 
and his works were considered delicate, tasteful and distinctly on the 
light side. He made flapjacks in the 
window of the Blue Tower Cafeteria, and anyone who watched his 
ambidextrous hot-cake-tossing knew 
that here indeed was an artist. Having dinner with him meant sitting 
across the counter, snatching phrases 
between servings, and filtering romantic comments through a mouthful of the specialise ds la ma 'non, as 
follows: 

"Hya, cinth." 

"Lo, quacious." This was a routine, an intimacy, and a mental exercise. "Stack them with cherry 
syrup.** 

"Food of the Gods! How's it 
with you, Tina?** Before she could 
reply he was gone to the front of 
the place, to fill the air with somersaulting pancakes. On his way back 
with a batter-bucket, she determinedly clipped his elbow. 



SO NEAR THE DARKNESS 



"Eddy, what kind of a man could 
walk between a photocell and a 
light and not ring an alarm?" 

"A ghost," said Eddy solemnly. 
"Or a vampire. Did you have one 
in the shop today?" 

She nodded. "That's nice," he 
said, automatically. He went to the 
mixer at the back of the cafeteria 
and began to fill his bucket. 
"What?" he bellowed 1 suddenly, 
and came back. "What about this 
guy? Did he wear a black cloak? 
Did he have a widow's peak, point. ed teeth and a demon in his 
pocket?" 

"No — I mean, yes. And he has a 
dragon in his cigarette case." 

Her hotcakes arrived. Eddy 
sprinted to the front, tossed and 
stacked eight additional cakes, 
rocketed to the back and turned oS 
the batter-cock just as the batter was 
forming a reverse miniscus. Then he 
peered over the edge of the bucket, 
and went back with it at a dead 
run, the bucket describing one single arc, like a pendulum- bomb, 
from the mixer to the griddles, 
without losing a drop. Someone up 
the line applauded. Eddy squirted 
a dozen discs of batter onto the 
griddle and came back to Tina. 
' "Are you kidding?" 

"Ah thirtny am mot," she said 
through a hotcake. , 

"You just mean a wolf. Not a 
.werewolf." 

"Ath a matter of ah,* she said, 
and swallowed, "he isn't. I mean, 
he didn't seem to be. He wants me 
for something, he says." 



He nodded eagerly, "But he's 
not a wolf. You're sure of that?" 

"I think," she twinkled — and it 
cost her an effort — "that he wants 
me for a fate worse than a fate 
worse than death." 

She changed her mouth from a 
bow to an O, and stoked. Eddy 
picked up two turners instead of 
one, a sign of deep thought. 

"What's with this dragon you 
spoke about?" he asked. 

"It's in the most gorgeous silver 
cigarette case you ever saw." 

"What does it do?" 

"It goes arrara." 

Eddy jumped back. "Don't do 
that," he gasped- "For Pete's 
sake — " 

"I'm sorry, Eddy. Terribly sorry. 
But that's exactly what it does. I — 
I'd like some coffee." 

"Black with one!" Eddy bellowed. "Where does this apple tend 
bar? Or does he panhandle on the 
Bowery?" 

"He's a dancer, Tina said. "When 
he left he pointed to the Mello 
Club and said, 'Look at that.' After 
I shut up the shop I looked. He's 
billed there — 'Brokaw and Rapunzel, adagio.' " 

"I'm out of grease," said Eddy 
to the waitress. "Tina, I don't like 
the sound of this guy." 

"Yes, Eddy." 

"See you tomorrow r' 

"Yes, Eddy." 

"Stay away from the Mello Club." 
"Yes, Eddy." 

So Tina went to the Mellow Club 
to catch Brokaw's act. 



10 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



The Mello Club was a cramped 
and crowded bistro in which the 
ceiling, having heard so many customers ask "How low can you get?" 
seemed to have accepted the challenge. The lighting was of a dimness to which the human eye could 
not become accustomed, because of 
its reluctance to recognize such atrocious color combinations. 

The dimness was functional,, insofar as the place had a function. 
It kept the customers in obscurity, 
so that each customer thought his 
own disgust was unshared, and 
therefore remained. It kept the customers' disgust from reaching the 
master of ceremonies while he created it. It suited the quality of the 
air, so that taint did not intrude. 
In short, a fine, healthy place. 

Tina fumbled her way down the 
steps and into the club, sighted a 
gleam of brass from a trombone 
bell, pointed her elbow at it, closed 
her eyes and walked. She was small, 
but she had the directness of a destroyer escort. She brought -up 
against a table not ten feet from the 
dance floor, which was, of course, 
two-thirds of the way to the wall. 
She sat down. 

Hardly had she done so when the 
up-beat cacophony from the orchestra came to a screaming stop and 
the master of ceremonies came out, 
dragging with him a microphone 
with a head as polished^ and featureless as his own. Into it and the 
glare of a ceiling spot which painfully flooded him, he hegan to re


cite what had happened to him on 
the way to the club that night. 

Tina rested her elbows on the 
table as the most comfortable way 
to keep her hands over her ears, 
and tried to locate Lee Brckaw in 
the babbling gloom. Occasionally 
she lifted her hands enough to find 
out if the emcee's droning obscenities were turning into anything like 
an announcement. 

It was hot. Someone was breathing down her neck. She leaned forward a little and found herself 
breathing in someone's armpit. She 
leaned back again. It must have 
been then that the announcement 
was made, because suddenly, shockingly, the lights went out. 

For a moment someone with the 
touch of a fly's foot seemed to be 
brushing a cymbal, and then there 
was not a sound from the tables. 
Slowly a blue-green light began to 
glow, so faintly at first that it could 
have been there for seconds before 
she noticed it at all. Gradually she 
became aware of a figure standing 
in the middle of the dance floor. 
The emcee? No, for he had been 
wearing a dinner jacket. This was 
something bone-white and slender. 
The light increased, or her eyes 
sharpened, and she suddenly saw 
that it was a girl, nude, splendidly 
if slightly built, and wearing some 
sort of a tall hat or — a crown. The 
light steadied, but did not become 
bright enough to show anyihing 
clearly. 

The girl began to dance. There 
was no sonorous music, only a 



SO NEAR THE DARKNESS 



faint, flute-like plucking which she 
recognized as a melody played, solely in the harmonics of a guitar. The 
girl moved slowly. She look two 
small steps forward, and then sank 
to her knees and touched her forehead to the floor. 

The musk stopped, but the heartbeat drum quickened as she straightened up again. There was'a moment 
when it missed one beat, and the 
shock of that was followed by a 
blaze of ycilow light and a painful, 
discordant blare from every brass 
in the orchestra. 

Tina's aching eyes cacght one 
brief glimpse of the girl's body as 
the dancer shook her head. Her 
crown was hair— real spun-gold 
hair that cascaded down and around 
her like water. She knelt there, head 
raised, wide blue eyes staring, arms 
up and out, cloaked in shimmering 
blue-green gold. And only then did 
Tina see Lee Brokaw. 

He was standing behind the girl, 
looking down at her impassively. It 
was he who held her white arms up, 
with his long fingers around her 
slender wrists. Slowly he brought 
them together and grasped both 
wrists in one hand. She turned toward him and rose. Her hair was 
impossible — bewildering. It fell to 
the floor in a mass that was (hick 
and delicate at once. It was liquid 
fire; it was smoke. It was like no 
other hair Tina had ever seen. She 
remembered the name of the art 
then — Brokaw and Rapuuzel. "R<\pnrtzcl, Rapunzel, let down your 
golden hair . . ." 



The music burst hoarsely into a 
travesty of the Apache dance. With 
slow, feline steps they moved about 
the floor. Brokaw's handsome, almost beautiful face held the girl's 
eyes. Her features were as motionless as wax. 

As they danced, he took one of 
her arms behind her and apparently 
began to twist it. Her body stiffened 
and arched backward; and her head 
too went back, Brokaw bared his 
teeth in a frightful smile, bent his 
head and put his mouth to het 
throat. They danced that way for 
four slow measures, and when he 
lifted his head, the marks of his 
teeth were easy to see. 

Abruptly he pirouetted away 
from her, and around her. She held 
her arms over her head, her hands 
touching his, her eyes glassily staring. The tempo of the music rose. 
Brokaw spun the girl to him and 
away, to him and( away, as the 
music sped up to its climax. He 
stopped her in a final pirouette, 
both her arms pinioned behind her. 

In a crescendo of noise and 
light, he raised his fist and smashed it into her upturned face. She 
dropped like a rag doll, and, as the 
cymbals crashed three times, and 
with his face as calm as a sunlit 
cathedral, he stamped on her head, 
crushing it flat. 

In the silence and the blaze of 
light, Lee Brokaw stood up, smiled, 
and bowed from the waist. Then a 
woman screamed, and applause 
broke out in one great shout which 
changed to a roar of bruising palms 



12 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



and stamping feet. Brokaw bowed 
again, scooped up the limp collection of long limbs and golden hair, 
and tossed it over his shoulder. Sawdust trickled from the flattened 
head, and the clever hinging of one 
white elbow could be seen. 

"But — she danced by herself!" 
Tina said aloud. 

"In -what kind of light?" said a 
man next to her, pounding the table, 
"And him in black!" 

The thunder rose, and rose again 
as the lights dimmed to toxic obscurity. And finally Lee Brokaw 
came out to take a second bow. 

He stepped out to meet the sudden spotlight, and as it fell on him 
he turned pale and clutched his 
chest. Something made the ringsiders shrink back from him. Something — the faintest of sounds. 

Arrara . , . 

"He's sick!" whispered someone. 

A woman half-rose and cried, 
"His heart!" 

"Has he got a heart on the right 
side?" asked the man next to Tina. 

Tina said clearly, "He has a 
dragon in his cigarette case." But of 
course no one paid her any attention. 

Brokaw bowed stiffly and went 
out. The chrome-plated master of 
ceremonies returned with his pastyfaced microphone, and Tina rose, 
dazedly made her way to the exit, 
handed a palm which materialized 
before her the cover charge plus 
ten percent, and escaped up the 
stairs. 

The outside air tasted so good it 



made her sneeze. She was still shuddering inside over Brokaw's finale. 
She walked briskly homeward, and 
gradually the shock of that terrifying performance was replaced by 
curiosity. 

What manner of man was Lee 
Brokaw? With an act like that, 
why wasn' t he on F if ty- secon d 
Street ? Or even on Broadway ? 
Why, if he so casually offered that 
cigarette case around to chance acquaintances was he so profoundly 
affected when it growled at him? 

How had he been so sure she 
would see him again? Did he have 
her figured so well that he had 
known she would be at the performance? Most of all, what on earth ' 
could he want with her? 

Turning in at her apartment * 
house, she fingered her cheek and 
jaw. Maybe he wanted a dancing 
partner who would spar a little 
and thus add a certain color to the 
climax. Of course, she had to admit 
that all that hair was becoming . . . 

Ill 

Tina undressed, went into her 
pajamas. She felt much better after 
that. She loaded her night table with 
sketching materials, a book on design, and two volumes of the Encyclopedia Britannica which had 
plates of shells. Two button sets 
and an izthatta later, she was happily asleep. 

It must have been four hours 
afterward that she awoke. She opened her eyes very quietly, without 



SO NEAR THE DARKNESS 



moving. Something urged her not 
to start up, but to relax and look 
the situation over. The situation was 
Lee Brokaw's smooth, imperturbable face, slightly larger than life 
size. It floated, apparently, in midair between her and the opposite 
wall. It wore a gentle smile which 
ended at the cheekbones., The eyes 
were as steady and as deep as ever. 

She said, "Wh-wh— " and the 
face turned chillingly upside down, 
got quite pink, then scarlet — a real 
blood -scarlet, as if it were looking 
at her through red glass — and then 
slowly disappeared. 

Tina blanched and dived under 
the covers. In a moment one arm 
crept out and, feeling along the 
night (able, turned on the lamp. She 
worked the blanket over her head 
and face, found an edge, doubled 
it into a sort of peephole, and peered out. 

There was nothing to see. 

She took a deep breath, held it, 
flung the covers off, bounded across 
the room and switched on the overhead light. 

Still nothing. She withdrew into 
the center of the room and gazed 
slowly around. A movement caught 
the corner of her eye, and she cried 
out in terror as she turned to face 
— her own reflection in the bathroom mirror! 

"Great day in the morning! Is 
that me?" she muttered, staring in 
shocked disbelief at the dilated 
pupils, the chalky countenance. 

"Bad dreams," she told her reflection reassuringly. "Some way or 



other, sister, you're not living 
ri 5 ht -" 

She washed hec face and went 
back to bed. She lay a moment in 
thought, then got up again and located a pair of nub-spiked golf 
shoes. These she put on the night 
table. Then she rolled over, tucked 
herself in, threw back the covers, 
got up, switched off the bathroom 
light, the overhead light, and, a* 
last, the night-table lamp. 

She was, by this time, much more 
annoyed than frightened. It had 
been many a moon since she had 
let anything throw her into such a 
dither. She fell asleep angrily, almost by an effort of will, and found 
herself in a fine technicolor nightmare involving a purring dragon 
which wanted to stamp on her head, 

She came up out of it fighting, 
only to find Brokaw's glowing face 
staring at her again. This time she 
was prepared, and in a single fluid 
movement she let fly with one of the 
heavy shoes. The shoe struck the 
face right between the eyes. There 
was a loud crash and a torrent of 
profanity from the street below. 

Tina turned on the light, peered 
around her, and went timorously 
to the window. She peeped out — 
no difficult feat since her sjioe had 
passed completely through the pane 
and apparently collided with the 
head of the policeman who was 
standing in cold-eyed fury directly 
below, kneading his skull and looking up. He fell silent the instant 
she appeared. 

She realized much too late that 



14 FANTASTIC 

he did so admiringly. There was 
plenty of light behind her. 

A policeman! She'd soon find 
out how Brokaw was pulling this 
little stunt! She'd slap him in jail 
until he begged for mercy and ihe 
devil called him Granddad! She'd— 

Her brain raced. She'd do what? 
Say to [he officer; "There was a 
face floating in my room and I 
threw a shoe at it and it disappeared and I want you to throw 
Lee Brokaw in the clink."? 

Oh, no. 

She turned to her empty room 
and screamed, *T11 teach you to 
come home at this hour, you heel I" 

"Lady," said the policeman, 
"talk to him more quietly or 1 11 
have to take a hand in this." 

"I'm so sorry, officer," she called 
down, and (hen even more loudly 
into the room, "now sec what 
you've done !" 

As she left the window she 
thought she could hear the policeman saying sadly, "The poor guy. 
I wouldn't be in his shoes." 

The following morning she arrived at her shop a few minutes 
later than usual. Not only had she 
overslept but she had been compelled to explain to the superintendent of her building that he had 
cleaned the windows so very clean 
that she had gone and stuck her 
silly head through one of the panes. 
She felt somewhat less than rested, 
and probably the least popular person in her cosmos was Lee Brokaw. 

She opened the door, glanced 
around at her displays, and went 



UNIVERSE 

back to the workroom. With grim 
deliberation she turned on the 
gooseneck lamp and the photocell, 
and settled down to work. 

Then she saw what was inscribed 
on the black blotter to her rt^ht. 
It had apparently been written with 
the silver pencil which was bundled up with all the other colors 
at the back of the tabic. It said, 
simply, "Here I am." 

It was written in a neat, possibly 
hurried hand, with line lines and 
an even slant. It was almost a feminine handwriting. 

"All right," she muttered. "Here 
I am, too." Tight-lipped, she picked 
up the blotter. 

There was another blotter underneath it — a white blotter. On it, 
very much less than life-size, was 
the same face she had seen in her 
bedroom. It did not turn upside 
down. It simply faded slowiy and 
disappeared. 

Tina sat tensely watching the 
blank blotter, her hands achingly 
clasped. She sat like that until the 
blotter began to blur. Then she 
closed her eyes. 

Aloud she asked herself. "Can 
I say it now, Tina? Can I, huh?" 
She nodded in reply. "Go ahead," 
she said to herself. "You'll feel 
better if you do." A pause. Then: 
"All right, I will. I'm really and 
truly scared, and I should never 
have listened to Eddy and I should 
never have gone to s-see that devil 
last night." 

Tina realized suddenly that this 
couldn't go on. Either she got away 



SO NEAR THE DARKNESS

from Lee Brokaw, Chelsea, New 
York itself — or she stayed. Going 
away was impossible froin a busi- . 
ness point of view and unthinkable 
from an ethical one. Then she must 
stay. But if she stayed, she couldn't 
just wait for something even more 
terrifying to happen. She had to 
smoke out the trouble. If things 
got worse, at least she'd know what 
she was up against. If things got 
better, well — that was what she 
wanted. 

What to do, then? 

Find Lee Brokaw, obviously, 
and get his story. Force him to 
talk even if she had to pound it 
out of him with a conch shell. 

The chime sounded. She put 
her face back together and went 
into the shop. "Eddy t" she exclaimed, and hoped he wouldn't 
notice how close she was to tears. 

"Hi, falutin'." 

She forced herself to smile. "Lo, 
brow." 

Eddy picked up an abalone shell 
and began toying with it absently. 
"How much were you kidding about 
that Lee Brokaw character last 
night?" he asked. 

"Not a bit," she assured him. 

"You said he was a vampire." 

"You said he was," she reminded him. "All 1 really know is that 
he walked in here with some proposition that I couldn't let him finish, 
that he had a cigarette "case which 
growled at me, and that he — " 

"Go on." 

"Nup." 

He knew that monosyllable well 



enough to leave it alone. "Okay, 
let's take it as it comes. All you 
know is that he walked in here — 
without the photocell noticing him. 
He made you some offer which you 
insist wasn't what one would assume it to be, though you don't 
seem to know why." 

"1 just know'' said Tina defensively. "Look, Eddy, if you think 
that Lee Brokaw is assuming the 
proportions of a deadly rival, you 
can think again." 

"I'm not worried," said Eddy in 
an unconvincing voice. 

"Eddy," she said ■ thoughtfully, 
"what is so fascinating about Lee 
Brokaw just now? I've never seen 
you fret about' anything like this 
before." 

"I've never run across anything 
like this before," Eddy said. "I'll 
tell you what I know, Tina. Maybe 
a couple of things will clear up. 
Last night about half an hour before closing time, Shaw was in. 
You know him — manager of that 
smoke-how where Brokaw has his 
act. He was in a fine froth. He 
wanted to know where Brokaw 
was. He stood up in a chair and 
yammered, at the customers. Seems 
he had a second show in a few 
minutes and Brokaw was among 
the missing.' 

"Any luck?" Tina asked. 

Eddy shook his head. "None of 
the customers seemed to know anything. I remembered what you 
said and called him over. He told 
me that he had hired a ham act 
and that Brokaw had come up with 



i6 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



something that wowed the customers. He was afraid that some competitor had bought him away, I 
think — though he pretended to be 
worried about the dear boy personally. 

"I asked bine what he knew about 
Brokaw — maybe we could locate the 
kind of place he might be found 
in. He didn't know a thing. Brokaw'd been in two days before and 
described his act and had done a 
short solo. Shaw never dreamed it 
was anything good." 
Tina shuddered. "It was awful." 
"Most of those acts are," said 
Eddy. "Anyway, I told him — what 
did you say? How do you know 
it was awful?" 
"I saw it, Eddy." 
"You saw — Didn't I tell you 
to keep away from there?". 

"Yes, Eddy. You told me," she 
said, and her voice was altogether 
too gentle. "You didn't ask me, 
though." 

"I didn't— Oh, I see. Little Miss 
Muscles can't be given orders, eh? 
All right, Tina. I'll stay out of 
your troubles. You can take care of 
yourself, and so forth. Only, when 
you're in up to your neck, don't — " 
"I know, I know. I'm not to 
come yelling for you. Don't worry, 
I won't." 

He went to the door. "I wasn't 
going to say that. I was going to 
say don't forget whom to yell for. ' 

The chime sounded his departure. 
Not loudly, but with a faint tin 
kling sound that slowly died awaj 
into silence.

She started ifter him, then 
stopped abruptly tod dropped her 
arms. Why did men have to be 
so pig-headed? Why did every man 
who got interested in a girl appoint himself as braintrust, bodyguard, and duenna? Just to top it, 
the men who liked her invariably 
said they liked her because she was 
independent and self -sufficient. She 
compressed her lips and halfsnorted, half-moaned in aggravation. 

The moan was answered from the 
back of the shop. 
Tina froze. 

The moan was repeated. It was 
not so much a moan of pain, though 
pain was there. It was a moan of 
desolation — of utter hopelessness 
and despair. 

Eddy was only a half-block away. 
Perhaps she should — on the other 
hand, Eddy was an egocentric, 
puffed up creature with a dictator 
complex who wanted his women 
helpless. She'd investigate herself. 
She squared her shoulders and went 
into the back room. 

There was nothing there but the 
moan. She looked under the settee 
and in the closet. Then she heard 
it again. It was outside, in the 
alley. 

With some difficulty — the door 
was almost never used — she shot 
back the bolts and pulled it open. 
She looked to right and left. The 
noise was there again, faintly, almost behind her. She looked down 



SO NEAR TH 

a short flight of cellar steps. Near 
'lie bottom was Lee Brokaw. 

"M-Mr. Brokaw?" 

He started violently, staggered 
to his feet and shrank against the 
wall behind him. He was tattered 
and dirty, and his fine jaw was covered with harsh stubble. But none 
of this subtracted one whit from 
his incredible grace. 

"You," he breathed, and his 
voice was still the mellow tenor she 
had noticed before. But now it was 
faint and frightened. 

"What's the matter? Are you 
hurt?" she asked with alarm. "Come 
up out of there!" 

"Will you take me inside where 
no one can see?" 

"Come on. No one will see," 
she promised. 

He tiptoed up, crouching, his eyes 
on her face. They were full of 
eagerness and hope, and a terrible 
fear. He dances every minute, she 
thought. 

livery single minute. 

He flowed around her and into 
;he open door like a feather borne 
on an eddy of wind. "Lock it," he 
Said) and while she complied he 
went to the partition and peered 
out. 

"The chime will ring if anyone 
comes into the shop," she said. 

"Will it?" he asked, and smiled. 

Remembering, she said, "Oh." 
She pushed past him and sat at 
her work table. "Stretch out on the 
settee," she said briskly. "I can see 
if anything comes in." Why she 
said 'anything' instead of 'anyone',

she didn't know. "Are you in trouble?" 

He nodded, sinking gratefully 
back on the settee. 

She stared at him. He looked so 
young, so- tortured. The face was 
so different from the bland, cruelly 
smiling one she had seen in her 
room. But she could not deny it 
was the same face. 

"I saw you last night," she told 
him, on sudden impulse. 

"I know you did," he said, putting his hand to his breast pocket. 
"I didn't see you, though." 

"Oli — the cigarette case! 1 remember. You don't mean it growled 
because / was there?" 

"It did." He took the case out 
and tossed it carelessly into her 
lap. She recoiled, staring at it. She 
was afraid to touch it, even to drop 
it. But she had to know. She gritted 
her teeth, lifted it, and said, "I'm 
going to open it." 

"Go ahead," he said, as if he had 
much more important things on 
his mind. 

She looked at him sharply. His 
eyes were closed, and a furrow of 
concentration was drawing together 
the inner ends of his brows. She 
drew a deep breath and — touched 
the clasp. The case sprang open. 

Of all the things she expected 
to fin d in that case — the little 
crawling horrors, the amulets, the 
runes on parchment, even perhaps 
the electronic gear (hat had so cleverly made the growling sound — 
what she tejist expected to find in 
it was what it actually contained.

The shock of it was almost more 
than she could stand. 

What she felt was the utmost 
refinement of the feeling you have 
when, in a dream, you mount ten 
steps where only nine exist. True, 
there was a dragon there. It was 
etched on the inside of the lid, but 
it was no more ugly than those on 
the outside, and it even wore a 
smile. Otherwise the case held, of 
all things — cigarettes. 

"This," she said, when she could 
at last say anything, "is positively 
the last straw. Lee Brokaw, who 
are you, and what makes you think 
you can frighten me? Why have 
you done things you must know I 
would refuse to believe — and bitterly resent." 

He rested on one elbow and 
looked at her. Again his eyes were 
unfathomable. "I am a dancer," he 
said. "If you tell ire what you 
think I have done, maybe I can 
explain. I want you, very desperately, to do something for me. I want 
you, because you're exactly suited 
to the task." He spread his hands, 
as if to say, "Could anything be 
simpler?" and lay back. 

"What is this task?" she demanded. 

"You mean — you'll do it? There 
was sudden hope in his eyes. 

Tina shook her head. "I certainly 
said nothing of the sort." 

"I can't tell you about it if there's 
any possibility of your not doing 
it," he said. 

"Well, then, drop dead or something," Tina flared. "I have a job!" 



UNIVERSE 

"You'll see me everywhere if you 
don't," he said. "At your home and 
at work." 

"I've had a couple of samples of 
that," she replied acidly. "I could 
get used' to it." 

"It will get worse," he said, almost pleadingly, as if he did not 
want it to happen. "Other people 
will have my face when you speak 
to them. You will feel my hands 
on your face and your body. You 
will hear my voice when you listen 
to music, and later, you will hear 
it more and more until the whole 
world is filled with my voice and 
my face and my touch. You will 
go mad." 

"I can keep you out," she said 
stoutly. "You can't walk through 
walls." 

"Or through light-beams?" 

Tina gulped. "I don't care what 
you do, or how much of it. You're 
crazy. I'm warning you now — ■ 
there's nothing you can do to persuade me to do anything for you." 

Arrara ... 

"Oh, please," gasped Brokaw. He 
swung off the settee and came to 
her, sitting at her feet with his 
easy, drifting motion. He took her 
hands in his long, strong, slender 
ones, and turned his face up to 
her. It was changed now. His eyes 
were wide with terror, and the 
delicate lips worked. 

His voice was a whisper, shrill 
with fright. "That was the last 
warning. It will be sometime today, or tonight. Please help me, 
Tina — please, please, Only you can

help me . . ." and he buried his 
face in her lap. 

She looked down at his shivering shoulders, and thought of the 
calm strength he had radiated; 
thought of his symmetrical, unshak cable expression of objective 
power. Then her mind returned to 
the poor broken thing before her. 

She stroked his sleek bl>ack hair. 
"You poor thing," she said. "I'll 
help you. You mustn't try, Lee, 
you mustn't. I'll help you . . ." 

He sprang to his feet joyously, 
and grasped her shoulders. "You 
mean it, don't you? You really 
mean it?" 

"My specialty," she said through 
a tight throat, "is sick kittens." 

"You're an angel," he said( 
hoarsely, and kissed her. It was a 
surprisingly gentle kiss, just between her left temple and her eye. 

"Now sit down and pull yourself together, Lee. I've promised. 
You'd better tell me what this is 
all about." 

"I killed a man," said Lee. Keeping his eyes on her face he moved 
backward and sank down on the 
settee. "I killed him when he was 
asleep. I hit him with a bronze 
book-end and then I opened the 
side of his neck with a little knife. 
His skin was tough," he added, 
"and the knife wasn't very sharp. 
It seemed to go on for hours." 

"I see," said Tina, holding tight 
to herself. She began to force a 
smile but decided against it; her 
cheeks might crack. "And it left 
you with a psychic trauma." 



M I suppose so," he said seriously, 
ignoring the weak attempt at facetiousness. "But that wouldn't be 
anything by itself. I'd be glad if 
thai were all. But, you see, after I 
did it, 1 had to get away, and I 
couldn't. People knew me. I was 
one of those noticeable individuals, 
I suppose." 

"You are." 

"Am I? Well, it doesn't matter 
now. I'm not what I was then. I've 
changed. I sold my — my soul." 

"What kind of mad talk is that ?" 
said Tina, straightening in alarm. 

"Go ahead. Take it for granted 
that I'm a psychopath. But you're 
going to help me, and you'll see. 
Don't you know that there are more 
forms of life on earth than the 
ones you read about in the biology 
books? You deal in shells. Ycu 
know the shapes and forms they 
take. You know the differences in 
the substances shellfish feed on. 
You know the peculiar variations 
(hat occur. Do you know there's a 
shellfish in the Great Lakes that 
makes its shell — " 

" — out of strontium carbonate instead of calcium carbonate. f 
course I know. So far this is my 
lecture, not yours." 

"Please listen," he said, "I don't 
know how much time I liave . . . 
There are creatures which feed exclusively on cellulose, and creatures 
which feed on the excreta of the 
ccllulosc-eaters." 

"You've got termites there," said 
Tina. She was beginning to feel 
a little better. She knew enough 



20 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



about abnormal psychology to be 
able to pigeonhole some of this. 

He ignored her. "There are creatures which eat granite, and lichens 
which live on them. But why go 
on? The world is full of this symbiosis, even in human beings. There 
are microbes living in us without 
which we would die. And 1 tell 
you that there are creatures on 
earth which can't develop a soul 
any more than a termite can digest 
cellulose. These creatures feed on 
the souls which we humans build!" 

"That's at least logical" said 
Tina. "Even if it happens to be 
untrue." 

"We can no mote understand 
them and their motives and methods 
and hungers than can the hungers, 
and dark biological urges of a bass 
be understood by the intestinal microbes of a minnow which it may 
have swallowed." 

"Very clear reasoning," said Tina, 
hoping that her mental reservation 
did not show. "How do you know 
that such a creature wants to eat 
your soul?" 

"I promised it," said Lee miserably. "You've heard the tales of 
selling your soul to the devil. 
They're poppycock, believe me. 
What I promised to give up, 
though, must be called a soul, because there is no other name for 
it. All those legends are true in 
essence. Heaven knows how many 
people lose their essence, their vitality — whatever you want to call 
it. These soul-eaters are psychic 
creatures. The psychic pressure of 



— you may call it the ethics, if you 
like — of a true promise, is binding. 
They give you what you want, in 
exchange for the promise of your 
soul." 

"That's a little nonsensical," said 
Tina flatly. "If they had access to 
souls at all, why don't they just 
gobble them up and have done 
with it?" 

"Do you," he asked, his voice 
too patient, "gobble up a steak in 
the butcher store? No. You carry 
it home. You store it for a while. 
You season it. You cook it — so 
much on this side, so much on the 
other. You serve it. Perhaps you 
add a touch of salt, or sauce, or 
tabasco. Only then do you eat it." 

"And what, pray tell me, arc 
these psychic sauces?" 

"Emotions," he said. "Fear. Humor. Terror. Disgust. Pity." 

"I see. And you're convinced that 
you are now basted for the last time 
and ready to take out of the oven?" 

"If you want to put it that way," 
he said, unhappily. 

"Don't mind my flippancy," she 
said with sudden gentleness. 

"I know why you do it," he answered, umlerstandingly. 

"Now," she said, "tell me all 
about this thing, and skip the theory. You killed this fellow. I imagine you had reason for it." 

"I had," he said briefly, with 
such terrible emphasis that she all 
but tangibly felt the wave of hatred. 
"After I kilted him, there was 
nothing I could do, no place I could 
go. I'd be seen leaving die house.

I'd be remembered at the depot, at 
the airport. Sooner or later I'd be 
found. 

"I was pacing back and forth 
in the library, trying to think of a 
way out, when I heard somebody 
cough. I was frightened out of my 
wits. There was a little man standing in the corner, smiling at me and 
rubbing his hands together. He 
looked perfectly ordinary. In fact, 
you see thousands of faces like that 
every day, and never remember 
them. The only thing unusual about 
him was his hair. He hadn't much, 
but, in that shadowy corner, it 
glowed. 

"He told me not to be frightened. He said he knew what I had 
done, and the position I was in. 
He said he could help me. I believed him. I was desperate, frantic, 
ready to believe anything. He said 
that he could tell me just what I 
could do to get out of my trouble, 
and be free. He said I need never 
pay the legal penalty for what I 
had done." 

Lee paused and moistened his 
lips. "I begged him to tell me. He 
played with me for a while, wanting to know how much I would 
give him. Finally I shrieked at him 
to tell me what he wanted. He told 
me. He gave me two years. Two 
full years. That looked like forever 
to me. I agreed. He got my solemn 
promise, and believe me, I was 
sincere. Then he taught me how 
to change." 

Tina waited while Lee sal brood


ing. She realized that he was finished. "What sort of change?" 

"I — don't want to tell you that. 
You wouldn't believe it. Nevertheless, I changed, and he kept his 
promise. I got away free, and came 
to New York. You know how I 
make my living. Of course, I don't 
push my hick. I think I could go 
to the top, I won't, though, unless 
I can live out the two years and 
beyond. I am morally certain if I 
can keep my — my — what it is he 
wants, I'll be safe from him and 
from the law for the rest of my 
life." 

"Quite a tale," said Tina. "Now 
you'd better tell me how the silver 
cigarette case enters into it." 

"I got it the night I promised," 
said Lee. "I— I can't seem to dance 
without it. I've tried, but without 
it I am no good at all. It seems 
to be just an ordinary cigapettc case, 
but—" ' 

"But indeed," shuddered Tina. 
"Still — I don't know. Lots of actors 
carry around a charm or a rabbit's 
foot. Tell me— what about those 
fantastic threats you made a moment ago?" 

"I'm glad I won't have to do 
any of those things," he said. "You 
see, when the Eaters feed, they do 
not take all of a person's essence. 
The body dies, of course, and what 
they want is eaten. But there is a 
good deal left over." 

"Bones and suet, kind of," she 
said helpfully. 

"Kind of." He smiled, but she 
could see it was an outward smile

solely. "That remnant still has a life 
of its own. Much of it is ugly and 
evil, I imagine most 'haunts' are 
exactly those left-overs, drifting 
around the places where they used 
to live and, depending on their 
quality, clinging to places where 
something bad has happened, or to 
the places where they were happy." 

"Hm. And which would I be, 
if you haunted me?" 

"If you had refused to help me, 
it would have been bad. Bad." 

"Okay, Lee. Now suppose we go 
back to my original question. What 
must I do?" 

"It's very simple. Just go with 
me when the time comes. You may 
not know what a remarkable person you arc. You positively radiate 
goodness, and courage, and humor. 
Perhaps I'm hypersensitive, done to 
a turn — " he smiled— "but I feel 
it vividly. I get it from you, and 
I think I re-radiate it. I think that 
if you were with me, with your wry 
wit and your psychic strength, and 
if I opened myself to you, I would 
prove distasteful to the Eater, and 
he would discard me." 

"Burn the roast, hey? Too much 
-salt in the cabbage? Is that all I 
have to do? Stay with you?" 

"That's absolutely all. And in the 
good clean outdoors, too, right here 
in the city. At the corner of Bleecker and Commerce. No pentagrams, 
no witch's brew, no dark caverns. 
You heard the cigarette case a 
while ago. I have until ten o'clock." 

"You want me to stay with you 
until then?" she asked. 



"It won't be necessary," he assured her. "What time do you 
close?" 

"On Tuesdays, about nine." 

"Good. I'll drop by — " 

"No," said Tina, suddenly thinking of Eddy South worth and the 
big, strong, misunderstanding feet 
he would put into this if he knew 
about it. Eddy would have to be 
stalled off. "I'll meet you at the 
drug store at the corner." 

"It's a date," he said. 

He got quickly to his feet, looking younger than he should with 
his stubble and his hollow eyes, and 
went into the front of the shop. 
She followed him with deep concern in her eyes. 

"Aren't you afraid of whatever 
it was you were hiding from?" she 
asked. 

He shook his head. "I'm not 
afraid of anything any more, thanks 
to you." He opened the door, and 
stepped gallantly aside. Urged by 
reflex, she preceded him through. 
The chime hummed. She stood in 
die doorway as he slipped past her. 

"I'm not going anywhere," she 
said. She realized only after he 
was gone that for the second time 
he had been in and out of the 
place without activating the chime. 
On both occasions she had just 
happened to be standing in the 
beam when he went out. She 
shrugged and went inside. 

The store seemed unusually deserted, chill and spiritless, as though 
in departing he had stripped away 
its individuality.

"I THINK I can," said Eddy 
South worth. He called to the pancake artist on the early shift. "Joe! 
Can you hang on a little longer? 
Tina wants to talk something over." 

"For you, no," said Joe, flashing 
a large smile. "For Tina, yes, Take 
your time, Eddy." 

Eddy steered her to a booth in 
the back. "What is it?" he asked. 

She began her reply with an . 
apology. "Eddy, hon, I'm sorry I 
barked at you this morning," she 
said. "But if there's anything I 
can't stand it's some good-hearted 
bumbling man being protective and 
laying down the law." 

"All right, Tina. I'm sorry, too. 
But I happen to be fond of you — 
all of you, including your neck." 

"My neck?" 

"The thing you stick out." 

"Oh, that. Well, you'll see that 
I am doing nothing of the kind. 
This Lee Brokaw business' is coming to a head tonight, and I don't 
want you messing around with it. 
Now sit quietly and I'll tell you 
all about it from the very start. 
Maybe then you'll see it's all right 
and let me handle it my way." 

"All right. I'm listening." 

She told him everything, from 
the face in her bedroom up until 
Lee's departure that noon. Early in 
the account Eddy began tp Sputter, 
She frowned at him until he 
stopped. Very soon afterward his 
jaw began to swing slackly. She 
stopped talking and aped him until 



he closed it. Finally she was 
through. It had been quite a recital, since her memory was good 
and her language vivid. 

"And just what are you going lo 
do?" Eddy demanded. 

"Exactly what he asked me to 
do," was her instant reply. 

"But Tina!" Eddy protested. 
"You're crazy! The man's a confessed murderer!" 

"Which would hold up in court 
only if supported by the evidence," 
she told him. "And if there were 
any evidence, he'd have been 
caught. You know what passes for 
evidence nowadays. A trace of dust, 
a couple of hairs . . . No, I don't 
think there was any murder." 

"Then what about this fantastic 
business of the face in your bedroom, and the cigarette case, and 
all that?" 

"Those faces I saw— well, I told 
you about his act, Eddy. Why don't 
you jump to the conclusion that I'm 
i poor impressionable female when 
you have the chance? I'm quite 
convinced that I'm seeing" things." 

i "I must admit it sounds like it. 
But why must you concern yourself with this at all? You say that 
Brokaw doesn't mean anything to 
you." 

"Every human being should mean 
something to us, Eddy. Lee's a 
dancer — better than good. He's 
great, He's a very sensitive boy. 
He's gotten a weird fixation, but 
fortunately there's a very definite 
time limit on it. If my not being 
with him means lhat he goes off his 



14 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



rocker, perhaps permanently, I don't 
want it on my conscience." 

Eddy looked at her with troubled 
eyes. "There is still one thing that 
troubles me. Why are you telling 
me all this?" 

"Eddy, I've made my own way 
since I was a kid, and when I marry 
it's going to be because the man 
I love and a girl named Tina are 
travelling together in the same direction at approximately the same 
speed, and each under his own 
power. I won't be steered, towed, 
nor provided with an icebreaker. 
This business with Brokaw is for 
the record. It wouldn't do any good 

tell you about it afterward." 

He looked at her in awe. "Hi, 
tension," he grinned. "That was 
a Speech !" 

"I'm just telling you, Eddy — if 
I see you at the corner of Bleecker 
and Commerce Streets at ten o'clock, 
so help me, I'll never see you again 
as long as I live." 

"You won't," he promised. "It's 
a quarter to nine now. Will you 
drop back here around eleven?" 

"Sure, Eddy." 

"Tina — " 

She waited. 

"Good luck." 

She smiled, put a kiss on her 
fingertips and brushed them across 
his mouth. 

When she had gone, Eddy 
walked to the front. "Joe," he 
called. 

"Huh." 

"I'll give you five bucks if you 
kang on for a couple of hours." 



"Nope.** 

"Ten, Joe. This is important." 

"Nope. I'll do it for nuttin'. 1 
know when a guy's got trouble," 

"Gosh, Joe. You're a real pal. 
If there's ever anything I can — " 

"Beat it," growled Joe. Eddy did, 
clasping, in his pocket, Tina's keycase, which he had filched from her 
purse. 

VI 

Tina and Lee Brokaw walked 
down Barrow Street. They had spent 
most of the past hour in a quiet 
bar and Lee still had not shaved. 
He was reserved and apparently 
in excellent control of himself. He 
spoke in monosyllables. As they 
turned into Commerce Street, Tina 
slipped her hand around his arm. 

"Do you feel all right?" she 
asked. 

"I feel fine," be assured her. But 
he was trembling, ever so slightly. 
He walked slowly, gazing ahead, 
his eyes flicking over the four corners of Commerce and Bleecker. 
There were a few people around, 
but apparently no one was waiting 
on the corner. 

"Maybe he's late," murmured 
Tina. 

"He won't be late," said Lee. 
He looked at his watch, "Four 
more minutes." 

One and a half of the minutes 
were used up in reaching the corner. Tina felt as if she were carrying a bier. 

"Did you hear about the nudist 



SO NEAR THE DARKNESS 



25 



who went to the fancy dress ball 
with an egg-beater over his shoulder?" she asked, 

"No," said Lee, smiling. "What 
was he masquerading as?" 
"An outboard motor, " said Tina, 
and added wildly, "that's the whole 
thing in a shcllhole. My brain is 
certainly working on all fours tonight." 

"Tina, Tina, hold on to yourself. 
I'll be all right. Just as soon. — " He 
broke off with a sharp intake of 
breath. Before them stood a slender 
little man with a partially bald 
head and a very ordinary expression 
on his face, who looked from one 
to the other of them. 

"Is this the girl you were talking about?" he asked mildly. 

"Here she is," said Lee, and viciously shoved Tina forward. 

"Lee!" she cried, utterly shocked. 

The bald man put out a hand — 
to stop her, to catch her, to ward 
her off, she did not know. She 
twisted away from him, almost fell, 
Staggered upright. Lee Brokaw was 
.sprinting away down Commerce 
Street. She started after him. 

Over her shoulder she saw the 
bald man coming after her, a bewildered and anxious expression on 
his mild little face. She put on a 
burst of speed, blessing her good 
sense in wearing ballet shoes, and 
for a brief moment gained on 
Brokaw. > 

"Lee!" she called. 

Suddenly something big and 
black leaped out of a doorway and 
shouldered into Lcc Brokaw. Caught 



in midstride, he caromed off into 
a lamp-post with bone-shaking 

force, The shadow caught him up, 
pinioning his arms behind his back 
and lifting him dear of the ground, 
bore him grimly along toward Tina. 

Tina tried her best to stop, but 
skidded past. Brokaw, dangling in 
that relentless grip; lashed his body 
about, biting and spitting like a 
cat. Suddenly he began to scream — 
terrible, high-pitched screams. 

The man carrying him said gruffly: "This is the one you want," 
and flung Brokaw down at the panting bald man's feet. 

The bald man bent and grasped 
Lee's shoulder. Lee screamed again 
as if the hand were made of 
white-hot metal. He screamed twice 
more, writhing and twisting on the 
ground, and then lay still. 

The big man said, "Tina, are 
you all right?" 

"Eddy! Oh, Eddy, Eddy darling!" She flew into his arms like 
a bird into a large tree. He put his 
face in her hair. "I told you so, 
you idiot," he said, "and I promise 
not to say it again." 

The bald man said hesitantly, H | 
have a warrant here for the arrest 
of 1 suspect in the case of Homer 
Sykes." 

"Never heard of him, said 
Eddy. 

"Take me home, Eddy." 

"I'm very sorry," said the bald 
man. "You'll have to come with 
me." 

Through the gathering crowd 
loomed a policeman, 'Hie little man 



26 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



rapped out instructions about a 
radio car and an ambulance. Another policeman rounded the corner. 
The man gave him orders about 
Staying with I.ee Brokaw until the 
ambulance arrived. Both policemen 
saluted. 

"We can walk/' said the bald 
man gently, "■it's only just over 
the block. That man, by the way, 
is dead." 

Tina and Eddy looked at < -uh 
other. Eddy shrugged. "You're the 
doctor," he said to the bald man. 

They went to the police station: 
There were a very friendly desk 
sergeant and three very sour policemen and a triply sour matron. Tlicy 
went to work on Tina with a great 
deal of efficiency. They took her 
fingerprints, but not Eddy's. They 
jusi asked Eddy questions about 
himself. 

Finally they were told to sit there 
and wait. They sat. Tina got as 
close to Eddy as she could without 
unseating him and asked, "We 
murdered someone called Sykes?" 

He patted her shoulder. "No, 
darling. It'll all come out all right. 
Shall I tell you a story?" 

"Tell- me a story." 

"Once there was a big lug who 
liked a girl who got into some 
fantastic trouble. So while she went 
on into her trouble, he swiped her 
keys and went on a pilgrimage." 

"Tell it .straight," begged Tina. 

"Okay. Well, maybe I'm just 
incapable of jumping to as many 
.conclusions as you. I don't know. 
Anyway, Brokaw's photocell beam 



stunt bothered me. I kept thinking about it until I suddenly 
hit it. I bought a flashlight and 
went to your shop. I turned on 
the rig. I found that anyone who 
wants to look for the cell can see 
it, and the light-cowl across the 
doorway too, for that matter. 

"Now, if you want to pass a photocell without interrupting the light 
that goes into it, you shine a light 
into it, step through the beam, and 
take away your light. The poor 
photocell doesn't know the difference. Not a simple rig like what 
I built, anyway." 

"I'll be darned." 

"Then I don't know what you'll 
be when I tell you the rest of this. 
Here." 

Eddy pulled something out of his 
pocket and dropped it into her 
palm. It was a ring of transparent 
plastic, slightly warped and sticky 
on one face. Around the edges were 
little curls of what looked like 
fused movie film. 

"This little treasure," he said, 
"was stuck to the bulb of your 
gooseneck lamp. Unless I am quitemistaken, it had a disc cut from a 
color-photo transparency mounted 
in it. It was aimed at the black 
blotter. When you came in, you 
switched on the light, diddled 
around a minute and then sat down. 
The black blotter did not show anything up. The white one acted as 
a screen on which was projected 
a nice clear picture of your friend's 
pretty face — until the heat of the 



SO NEAR TUB DARKNESS 



27 



bulb ruined it I found jimmymarks on the alley window." 
"But, why on earth should he—" 
"Ask questions later. Listen. That 
projection deal woke me right up. 
I didn't even have to go to your 
place. That shoe you threw— did 
you hit the face that was floating 
in your room?" 

Tina nodded. "Right between the 
eyes." 

"Then what happened to the 
shoe ?" 

"It went straight out the win — 
oh!" 

"Yes, oh. The face wasn't in 
the room. It was on that tight meshUcc curtain you have tacked over 
the lower pane." He shrugged. "So, 
I went looking for some sort of a 
projector that could do a job like 
that. I went just down the street 
to the Mcllo Club. I got hold of 
Shaw, the manager. He's a slimy 
little scut. I told him I had something hot on Lec Brokaw, hut I'd 
have to check his dressing room to 
be sure." 

"Shaw didn't like the idea much, 
but he's so crazy to get a line on 
Brokaw that he'd give away his 
mother's left leg if he had to. He 
showed me the place. He crabbed 
about the lock on the door. Brokaw had had it put on. It was 
quite a place. You should see those 
mannequin heads that Lee made. 
I went through the drawers, and 
found what I was after. I swiped 
it. Here." 

Out of the same capacious jacket 
came a specially built five-cell elec


tric torch. Around the lens ^as a 

spring clip. "Here's a whole set 
of slides. Colored ones, and this." 
He handed her the glass disc. It 
was black, except for a spot in the 
center, winch, when held up to the 
light, held a miniature transparency 
of Lee Brokaws almost beautiful 
face. 

"They clip right on here like 
this," and Hddy snapped a black 
glass over the lens. "Brokaw just 
aimed that thing at your window, 
and then, probably, tossed a pebble 
or something at the glass. He held 
it until he saw your light go on. 
After that he could probably see 
you." 

She blushed. "He probably 
could." 

"Shaw told me something else. 
He's a low little scruff, as I said 
before, 1 just stood there looking 
thoughtful, and he volunteered the 
information that he actually had a 
periscope — can you imagine it? — 
from his oflice next door, so that 
he could keep a dirty eye on whoever was in the dressing room. And 
he found out something reaily 
choice about our friend, Lee Brokaw." 

"What?" 

"I think I'll wait and let the 
sergeant over there tell you. He's 
bound to come up with it before 
he lets us out of here." 

"How oh earth did you get that 
gadget out of Shaw's hands?" 

"This searchlight thing? Oh, I 
just said something about the back 
room. Those joints always have a 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



28 

back room. He was very nice to me 
after that" 

"Eddy! You might have gotten 
into some serious trouble!" 

He laughed. "That — from you! 
Well, after that I hightailed it for 
Bleecker and Commerce, and hid 
in a nice dark doorway. I don't 
know what would have happened 
if Brokaw had run up the other 
street. There goes the desk phone. 
Listen." 

The sergeant picked up the instrument briskly. "Speaking," he 
said. "Yeah, we've 'still got 'em. 
You don't say!" Then followed an 
infuriating series of granted affirmatives While he wrote. Then, "Okay. 
Soon's I write it up. There may 
be a couple more questions." He 
hung up, and began to write. 

"Master mind," said Tina while 
they waited, "can you tell me why 
Lee did all those things?" 

"I can guess," said Eddy. He 
leaned back and caught his knee 
between his palms. "Lee Brokaw, 
for all his skill and sensitivity, was 
the victim of a very real delusion — 
that soul-eater business. You, my 
child, were a substitute." 

"Me!" 

' "Yes, you. He saw in you courage 
and humor. He probably felt he 
had the same. Perhaps he did. But 
he needed some more things that 
you had. The — what was it?— the 
seasonings. Fear, terror, disgust, 
pity. That's what he was conditioning you with." 

"But how could he imagine that 



the soul-eater would mistake me for 

him?'
"For the same reason he thought 
the law would. He played it very 
cagily. That murder, now, was apparently a perfectly genuine one. 
He called up the police and tipped 
them off that the Sykes murderer 
would be at Bleecker and Commerce Streets at ten o'clock. I think 
he figured diat the soul-eater, on 
seeing the surrender, would quickly 
jump at the first seasoned meat he 
saw that looked like the right one 
— rather than break his promise of 
keeping the murderer clear of the 
law. I imagine Brokaw was a little 
surprised to find only one person 
there — the detective." 

"Unless that detective is also a 
soul-eater," said Tina brightly. "But 
Eddy, I still don't understand how 
he could dream that the soul-eater 
could make such a mistake." 

"Sergeant," called Eddy, "could 
we be .getting out of here soon? 
I'm supposed to be working." 

"Oh, I guess so," said the sergeant cheerfully. "There don't seem 
to be much more to figure out now. 
It all ties up." 

"Mind telling us why we were 
delayed?" 

"I s'pose oat, young feller. Seems 
like about two years back, this 
feller Sykes got married and killed 
the same night. They never did 
find the missus, and there wasn't 
a fingerprint in the place. It must 
have happened within an hour after 
they got to his place, and every 
fingerprint was wiped clean. Sykes

had brought this girl from out of 
town. No one knew hec. It was 
obvious she done it, but there 
wasn't but one clue as to who she 
was or anything about her. Even 
her license informition was false. 

"But there was one piece of evidence she didn't know about, or, 
she'd have gotten to that, like as 
not. It seems Sykes sent a picture 
of her to his sister, and in the letter he said she had a great ugly 
mole on her back shaped like an 
angelfish. Well, now wc know. 
She's been opcratin' here for the 
past year and a half as an actor, 
ventriloquist, and dancer under the 
name of Lee Brokaw." 

"Lee Brokaw is a girl?" 

"Was, ma'am. Dead now. Coroner says she apparently died of 
fright when she was nabbed. What 
we held you for, young lady, is 
because you are the spit an' image 
of Mrs. Sykes, before she cut and 
dyed her hair according to that picture. If it wasn't for that mole on 
Brokaw-Sykes' back, you'd have a 
time proving you didn't do it." 

"He — he needed a shave!" she 
said desperately. 

"Phony stubble, ma'am. Got it 
right here in the report." 

"Mad, mad, crazy as a loon," 
murmured Tina as they went out. 
"The poor kid. How on earth did 
she ever dream up this soul-eaters 
thing?" 

"Paranoid logic, I guess," said 
Eddy, 'who reads books. "A persecution complex and an absolute 
genius for rationalizing it," 



They walked in silence for a 
block. "I'm glad," she said, "that 
that soul-eater's hypothesis is rationalized. That was a pretty convincing — axvkl" 

"What's the matter?** 

"Someone in that doorway," she 
shuddered. 

1 1 was dark there, but there 
seemed to be something ... he 
pulled out Brokaw's flashlight and 
switched it on. 

It gave a peculiar, dim light. 
Standing in the doorway was a mildlooking little man, almost bald. He 
was looking at them and rubbing 
his hands. 

His fringe of hair g! o wed a 
ghostly green. 

"On your way, I see," said the 
little detective happily. "A most 
unpleasant experience." He came 
closer. Tina shrunk away from him. 

"Mind if I ask you," said Eddy 
faintly. "D-do you use vaseline in 
your hair?" 

The man touched it "Why yes. 
Why?" 

"Ha ha, good stuff, hey?" said 
Ikhly, and, scooping up Tina, he 
all but galloped away. 

"It's all right, Tina," he said as 
they hurried. "It's perfectly all 
right. I still had that black disc on 
the flashlight. It's an ultra-violet 
filter, Vaseline fluoresces just fine 
under ultra-violet." 

What he did not tell her, and 
what he sincerely hoped she would 
never find out, was that vaseline 
fluoresces blue, not green.

The Visemo had become an escape 
mechanism — quite as deadly as 
a distilled essence of cobra 
venom. But one man dared defy it. 



The visemo broadcasting center 
had been set for the night. 

John Mallory stood quietly beside his desk, looking up into the 
darkness of the high-arching dome, 
which towered for half a thousand 
feet above him. He was a small 
man with a body that stood straight 
as a ramrod and eyes that were as 
bright as those ol a cat staring into 
a beam of light. His rather gentle 
face was seamed with sorrow. 

He saw the shiny steel runway 
spiraling up and up against the 
dome's blue-black roof. He saw the 
two thousand white, red and green 
button lights blinking on and off 
— and the thousand dial faCM 
glowing softly. He checked the 
lights. for correct patterns. Satisfied, 
he thought: It's like the night sky 
and no one alive hut me has ever 
seen the night sky. But someone 
must. But when? In my lifetime? 

It was at this moment he saw 
the massive steel door directly in 
front of him rising silently, like a 
portcullis. Instantly he faced it. 
Three men were entering the dome. 
Mallory recognized them instantly 



When Isaac As'imov was very young he wrote a truly magnificent story about a 
smiety of walled-in cave dwellers cut off for long ages from the stars. When 
finally they did see the stars they went mad. That story has become a classic 
of its kind, and we seriously doubt if the splendor of its mood can ever be 
surpassed. But now Richard Stockham has come up with a more individualistic 
interpretation of the same exejting theme — one man against the darkness instead 
of an entire culture-complex— which we're convinced will hold you spellbound.

BACK TO 

—the Mayor, the chief psychologist, and the head technician. 

Something' s wrong, he thought. 
They'd never just walk in on me 
like this. How much have they 
found out? 

He stood very still as they 
marched toward him, like generals 
on a deserted reviewing field, trying to pretend that a column of 
crack troops was still lined up 
awaiting their approval or displeasure. 

The three men stopped ten feet 
away. 

"We've come to ask you some 
questions," said the Mayor. Mallory noted the grimness in the man's 
heavy face and gray eyes and he 
was further disturbed by the stiffness of the tall, erect figure. 

"All right, Mr. Mayor," he said 
slowly. 

The Mayor seated himself at the 
desk. The psychologist came up 
and stood beside him. He was 
hcavyset and short, wore a goalee 
and had dark, piercing eyes. 

The technician, a bald-headed 
wisp of a man, was already moving up the spiral runway. 

Abruptly the Mayor said, "Mallory, your family came to see us 
today." 

With a stubborn effort of will 
Mallory controlled his surprise. 
"You mean," he said, "they left 
the house and actually .came to your 
office and talked to you?" 

The Mayor nodded, and turned 
for confirmation to the psychologist. 



NORMAL 31 

"They were on the verge of hysteria," said the mental specialist. 
"The visemo programs have failed 
to sooth them." 

"My God," exclaimed Mallory. 

"We went to your house," said 
the Mayor. "We checked your 
visemo receiver. It happens to be 
in perfect working order." 

So they didn't find it, thought 
Mallory. They didn't find it. 

"The people's only source of 
stimulation," said the psychologist, 
"is the visemo, as we all know. 
And in this particular city it comes 
from here — or it should. I would 
say, Mr. Mallory, there's a possibility thai yotir family is absorbing 
emotional and intellectual stimulation from somewhere else." 

Mallory sat down, assuming an 
appropriate attitude of dejection. 

"The impending, almost certain 
tragedy," went on the psychologist, 
"of this one outbreak of hysteria 
cannot be exaggerated. One family 
has began to break down. And yet 
they're supposed to be under perfectly-conditioned control. The 
ghastly aberration could spread to 
other families, and to other cities. 
That would be catastrophic. Our k 
whole system of control would 
break down. You remember, of 
course, how the madness broke out 
before visemo. and wliat a terrible 
thing it was. It mustn't happen 
again. We're the first generation 
underground. Our discipline must 
be complete." 

His features hardened. "You understand that, of course. You can't 



32 FANTASTIC 

forget it. Memory of our life on 
the surface is a terrible burden to 
bear. But we've got to bear it. 
We've just got to keep remembering how much easier it will be for 
our children and the generations to 
come. Our life span is a hundred 
and twenty-five years. Sometimes I 
wish it wasn't. But that's the way 
it is. And visemo is our one and 
only barrier against madness. It's 
got to be protected." 

He paused. "Mr. Mallory, your 
wife and, to a lesser extent, your 
two children were in terrible conflict this morning. They couldn't 
reconcile themselves to the two 
types of programs that have been 
coming to them over visemo. Now 
you spend your entire evenings 
watching, feeling, thinking visemo. 
Have you been in conflict over the 
programs at any time?" 

"No," said Mallory. "Not at 
all." 

, "That's strange." The psychologist paused. "It could be, of course, 
that the programs were in perfect 
order while you were home." 

"Did my wife describe any of 
them to you?" 

"She tried to. But it didn't make 
much sense." 

"What is it you want me to do?" 
asked Mallory. 

"Just go home tonight. Be with 
your family. Watch the visemo. 
Feel the emotion and intellect 
beams. From this end, Mr. Evans, 
our technician, will check the visemo center thoroughly." 

"I could check it," said Mallory, 



UNIVERSE 

"better and faster." He thought of 
the hidden broadcasting set he had 
built into the massed wires and 
circuits and beams, high in the center's top. "After all I helped build 
the center. I — " 

"Just a moment." The psychologist raised a finger. "We need an 
objective opinion." 

"All right!" said Mallory. Then 
more quietly, "Suppose you find 
the center in order. Suppose my 
wife and son and daughter stay 
the way they are now." 

The Mayor stood up. "In that 
case, it will probably be necessary 
to devise some sort of shock treatment or operation that will destroy 
your memories of each other." 

Mallory felt a wave of despair 
sweep over him. 

"Of course," said the psychologist, "if such a thing is done it 
will be quite painless. And since 
family ties are only a matter of convenience there will be no grief." 

"I understand," said Mallory. 
-"And now I'm to go home and 
watch visemo, as usual." 

"That's right," said the Mayor. 
"With your family. You'll find 
them waiting for you in front of 
the visemo screen. They were given 
a mild sedative that must have worn 
off by now. They'll be watching 
one of the standard programs. Tomorrow morning you can report 
here at the usual time." 

Fighting to control the trembling that was creeping through 
his body, Mallory moved tcross 
the great black-walled room. Si


BACK TO 

lcntly the massive steel door rolled 
upward and he stepped out into 
the travel tunnel. 

The bullet-shaped tunnel cars 
were darting past on their magnetic 
currents ten feet in front of him 
and the entire tunnel was as bright 
as day, stretching off to right and 
left like a mile-long glass tube blazing with radiance. 

Now his dread was a stifling 
thing. In his mind, he could see 
his family waiting in the circular 
living room with the visemo eye 
.staring deeply into them, and the 
emotion and intellect beams focused 
upon them. He had an intolerable 
mental picture of the beams playing all through their brains and 
along their nerves, probing into 
glands and vital organs with desires that became needs. 

For ten years he had feared this 
evening. And now the facing of it 
was like a leap into darkness. 

He stepped forward, breaking 
an electronic beam. One of the 
bullet-shaped cars stopped. Climbing into it, he pulled shut the hatch 
and pressed a button on the dashboard. Immediately he was immersed in the floating speed with 
the white blur of the tube walls 
all around him. Leaning back, he 
closed his eyes, knowing that it 
would be ten minutes before the 
car reached the suburbs, five hundred miles out. 

A century before, "where the 
tunnel now stretched, there had 
been only a labyrinth of subterranean caverns rushing with rivers that 



NORMAL 33 

drained into the oceans while the 
surface of the Earth writhed in 
convulsions under the rain of the 
great missiles. And now the people who had burrowed into those 
deep, empty places, preferring life 
underground to death on the radiation-saturated surface among the 
black craters were beginning to 
think and feel again. 

It was a long time before the 
representatives of the huddled 
groups scattered here and there 
over all the Earth agreed that the 
past must be locked away in stone 
vaults so that man could begin 
again with what was native to hii 
own mind. 

So the books that lay about in 
the rubble, the works of art, everything disturbing and controversial 
was locked away permanently — ■ 
philosophy, psychology, religion 
and history. All this, in each of 
the great city scars, was sunk deep 
into the ground in massive stone 
vaults, sealed shut— and forgotten. 

Only the survivors' knowledge 
of machinery and science was left 
upon the face of the Earth for the 
people to build upon. 

Soon great cities, five hundred 
miles in diameter, began to grow, 
one upon each continent— South 
America, North America, Europe, 
Asia, and Africa. The cities of the 
stone cupolas, they were called, 
each cupola twenty feet in diameter. Mounds of stone, they were 
doorless and windowless, and leadlined, to hold back the radiation 
death. While the men toiled in their 



FANTASTIC 

gray radiation suits the women and 
children waited deep within the 
ground. 

The surface of the Earth had 
been killed, the scientists affirmed. 
And it would never come to life 
again. Man must live forever separated from the sky and the land. 
And, after many generations, the 
surface of the Earth would be only 
a place for him to explore, as he 
had once explored the depths of 
the oceans or the depths of space. 

This would bring almost unendurable pain and sadness to the 
first generation, which could remember, and to the next, which 
would share vicariously the longing from their parents as they listened to the stories of how life had 
been lived under the sky, But the 
memories would eventually die and 
* the stories would become myths 
and man would adjust to his environment. 

And after many years, the cities 
were finished. The cities with the 
tunnels for streets, below the cupolas, and the people living like ants, 
never knowing the night and djy 
sky, never knowing the live growing things upon the Earth, never 
feeling the push and buffet of wind 
nor the driving wetness of rain 
nor the warm press of sun. 

Only the stone cupola, cups with 
the people sitting and waiting now 
that the work was done. 

Waiting for what — with the silence and the sitting and the wondering ? The answer was, of course 
— the machine. The machine tend


UN IV ERSE 

ed gardens, below the cities, and 
parceled out food. The automatic, 
self - repairing sewing machine 
turned out clothes, and the exercise 
machine kneaded and rolled, pushing and pulling. 

The doors of the cupolas opened 
it the approach of a shadow and 
the bullet transportation cars flashed along the shining tunnels, 
whisking the people from place to 
place where they talked and talked 
endlessly of the clothes and the 
food, and of the waiting, and the 
wondering. Where were they going 
and why? Where, where? The 
twenty- second century miracle cities 
were stocked to repletion with comfort and security pressed down and 
running over. 

And then one day a man clawed 
at the walls of his cupola and another sank into an endless lunatic 
trance. Others cried out against the 
stillness, pleading with the circling 
tunnels to straighten, and ran yelling and stumbling all through the 
intolerably safe labyrinth of the 
cities. 

There arose, then a need for 
something new and different that 
would restore sanity to the restless 
and despairing. 

There were a few men and women who remembered the old days 
of television, to whom the fundamentals of these old machines were 
still a treasured legacy from the 
times of the exploding missiles and 
the self exile of millions in the 
underground caverns. 

And so these few brought back 



BACK. TO 

the ancient television sets and the 
broadcasting centers, as they had 
been before the great devastation 
of the Hydrogen Wars. And when 
the people^ watched television they 
no longer pounded the walls of 
their cupolas or wandered, shocked 
and staring, along the tunnels of 
the cities. 

The new technicians added to 
the old television. They added 
emotion and thought beams — third 
dimension and stereo-sound. They 
added the screen that curved 
around three walls of the room and 
color and taste and touch. 

And with each addition, the people in the cities grew quieter. They 
sank back listening and watching, 
enjoying to the full the splendors 
of sight and sound, of thinking and 
feeling, which the great curving 
screens brought to them. 

A contest was held over all the 
Earth then to find an inspiring 
name for this new savior of humanity. 

The name chosen was visemo. 
And so the madness was subdued and held in check. 

II 

John Mallory opened his eyes. 
The tunnel light engulfed him and 
the bullet-shaped tunnel car seemed 
to hang poised in the daekness. Yet 
he could sense its terrible speed. 

And he remembered. 

He could remember back to the 
night before the visemo was conceived, before even the ancient 



NORMAL 35 

television had been revived. He 
had been one of those who had 
felt themselves sinking into the 
madness, the insatiable craving to 
see space out beyond the winding 
tunnels of the city. Yet he had 
struggled within himself, desperately, to hold at bay the awful thing 
that had happened to him. 

And while he walked through 
the endless winding tunnels, his 
eyes on the gray walls pressing in 
upon Shim, he knew that he must 
find some way of escaping into 
whatever lay beyond, even if his 
daring led to his death. 

So John Mallory, electronics expert, machinist, physicist, mathematician, conceived and fashioned a 
cutting instrument that could open 
up the walls. He perfected it as 
the other men were frantically endeavoring to keep the people from 
even thinking about what lay beyond their safe stone and steel labyrinth. 

Then late one night, while his 
wife and his two children lay 
asleep, he held the finished instrument in his hand. It was a disc — 
a simple circle of steel with a white 
button in its center. 

As he looked at his invention, 
he wondered how it had happened 
that he alone, of all the people in 
the city, had decided that he must 
go out on the surface of the Earth 
and had logically discovered a 
means of doing so. 

But he could not know— just as 
the first man who had used fire 
could not have known— why such 



36 FANTASTIC 

a discovery had come to him. Or 
the first man to conceive the bow 
and arrow, or trace out the crude 
outlines of a bison on the walls of 
a cave. 

A feeling, a drive, an inner need, 
simply translated itself into action 
because that was the way it had 
happened. And who could know 
the u>&y of it? 

And so John Mallory had put his 
philosophical problem aside. He 
stepped close to the wall and held 
the disc against it. He pressed the 
little white button. A beam from 
the disc thrust through the wall, 
instantly dissolving the molecules 
of lead and steel alloy and concrete. 
He moved the disc from the floor 
up in a half circle and down Jo the 
floor again. A piece of the wall fell 
outward. 

He crawled out on the quiet 
E.irih under the blue-black sky with 
the spread of stars broad and deep 
above him and the air cold and 
fresh in his nostrils. He stood for 
a long time letting the cleanness 
and freshness and the wide expanse 
of wonder soak into his starved 
body and mind. 

At last, with twenty minutes left 
of the forty-five minutes allotted to 
him before the saturation of the 
r.idiation death, he began to walk, 
checking the time, ten minutes out 
and ten back. And just as he was 
becoming deeply aware of the 
swinging, rhythmic motion of himself across the Earth, he suddenly 
felt a jolt of hardness under his 
feet. 



UNIVERSE 

Bending down, he found the 
great slab of concrete, the top of 
the vault that held the ideas th.it 
argued with each other. An immense storehouse it was, containing 
in its shadowed recesses works of 
philosophy, psychology, and religion — and all the vanished splendqrs 
of music and art 

Using the tool that had opened 
the cupola wall, he made an opening in the stone roof and let himself down into the great cavern. 

He stood [here, swaying in 
wonder and staring at all the creative accomplishments of man's 
mind, and heart. 

Suddenly, when he touched his 
timepiece and realized that he had 
overstayed his time an hour beyond 
the safety margin of the radiation 
death, he sank down and prepared 
to die. But death did not come and 
he knew then that the radiation no 
longer rose dangerously from the 
Earth. 

And so, through the years, he 
returned at night into the vault and 
became lost in contemplation of the 
paintings, the music, and the 
sculpture. He let the ideas and the 
excitement from the books open up 
within him like a bright, manypetaled flower. He took many of 
the books home and hid them and 
read them at night while his family 
slept. 

He read of how man had blasted 
into radio-active dust the cities that 
he had built with such daring and 
creativencss; read how he had 
killed the living surface of the Earth 



BACK TO 

and burrowed deep into the drained 
subterranean caverns and tunnels 
and had waited for he knew not 
what, shivering in fear. 

He read too of how terrified humanity had buried its past as it 
might have buried a body that had 
been murdered in a blind fury and 
had sunk it deep so that it could 
no longer haunt the dreams of the 
living. 

Suddenly now, Mallory was conscious of the lighted tunnel and the 
bullet travel-car floating motionless. 
Opening the hatch, he stepped out 
onto the concrete platform and 
walked down a passageway, past 
the many doors that opened into 
the long line of cupolas. 

As he walked, he remembered 
how he had often seen his wife, 
Helen, and Mary and Bob, his 
children, absorbing without any real 
understanding the sights from the 
visemo eye, and the thoughts from 
the beams '.hat played so relentlessly upon their brains and nerves. 
He remembered the pain of fighting the hypnotism of the beams, 
while he watched with horror the 
minds of his wife and children 
floating away from him, like swimmers on a dark lake. 

When he realized that they 
would eventually lose their identities in the great eye of the viscmo 
receiver, he knew he must struggle 
to save them. So he searched within himself for a weapon and. after 
many months, he knew that there 
was only the machine itself left fur 
him to fight with. 



NORMAL 37 

For many hours and weeks he 
went out at night upon the Earth 
and walked. He thought of the 
tasks that still lay before him, like 
some awful deed. He thought of 
the weight of his duly and searched 
within himself for the strength to 
endure it 

Only a machine was left to use 
as a surgical instrument to cut 
away the scars of deadness and 
blindness from the minds of his 
wife and children, And if he were 
able to succeed? What then? Could 
there be any teal hope or freedom 
for just the four of them out upon 
the Earth, living the life of the 
Earth, with the others left deep 
within the deadness of the tunnel, 
and the cupolas? 

Just life for himself and his 
family, and everlasting despair for 
the others? He knew then that he 
must save them all. The others too 
had to be given a chance to live 
again. And only he could give them 
that chance. 

An idea had come to him tnd 
there was a something in himself 
which demanded that he pass it on 
to them. 

And so the choice was made, 
and his secret work began. 

There were weeks and month; 
of it — a labor that centered about 
the secret building of the tiny 
visemo broadcaster and receiver, 
while he was alone during the day 
in the visemo broadcasting center. 
The tiny broadcaster was woven 
into the very wires and currents of 
the i tsemo center, and the tiny 



38 



FANTASTIC UNIVBXSB 



receiver "was moulded at night in 
his house, while his family slept, 
into the intricate internal medianistn of the visemo receiver. 

And finally the work was done. 
He was ready with the pictures of 
the food and the million things 
being dissipated, first for moments 
and then for minutes, in the great 
broadcaster. He was ready too with 
the pictures of the old plays and 
the works of art and literature that 
he had found in the sunken concrete room, which would be run 
through the tiny broadcaster, picked 
up by the tiny receiver and transferred into the visemo eye and the 
thought and emotion beams, and 
from them into the minds and 
hearts of his wife and children. 

Mallory stopped before a door 
that was like all the others in the 
long line of doors. 

Silently it slid back and the 
room opened up before him. He 
saw the dimness, and the flickering 
colored lights which were reflected 
on the walls from the half circle of 
screen. He saw the emotion and 
thought beams playing gently on 
the three 6gures sitting there before him. 

He stopped just inside the door. 
It closed quickly behind him. His 
wife and the children did not look 
at him, 

Instantly he felt a surge of desire to buy. To buy the black velvet 
dress, skin tight at its top, and 
flowing full and swinging to the 
ankles. It was being modeled on 
the screen by a tall willowy girl 



with silver hair and a rarely beautiful face. 

"Buy it," the smooth round 
tones said. "Buy it. Rejoice in the 
soft flowing silkiness, the clinging 
satin caress and the heady perfume 
instilled forever in the texture of 
the cloth. Buy it." 
Buy it for his wife. 
The desire engulfed him. 
And at that moment his wife 
saw him. Rising she said, "Oh, 
John, I've got to have it." She was 
a thin, graying little woman, in 
late middle age. Her movements 
were sparrowlike, her face and eyes 
intense, expectant. 
He did not move or speak. 
The girl jumped up. She was 
a child, trembling on the verge of 
adolescence. "Get it for her daddy," 
she pleaded. "Please." 

And the boy, a mid-adolescent, 
urged, "You've got to get it, Dad." 

Then both children sat down, 
watching the screen again. 

Mallory felt a dizziness. My 
God, he thought, they've tripled 
the power at (he center. He sank 
into a chair. 

Now a picture of a broiled 
chicken and a jelly omelet with 
coffee and toast appeared on the 
screen. He could smell the crispness and the aroma. A man and 
woman sat at the table on which 
the meal reposed and began eating, 
ecstasy in their faces. 

Instantly Mallory experienced intense hunger, as though he had not 
tasted food for hours. Glancing at 
his wife, he saw her moisten her 



BACK. TO 

lips. He saw the hoy rub his mouth 
and then gently press his stomach. 
He saw the girl swallow hard and 
squirm in her chair. 

His wife said, "Tonight. We'll 
have it tonight, for dinner. She 
turned to Mallory. "John, press the 
buttn to the food center." 

"I'm starved," said the boy. 

"Me, too," said the girl. 

Mallory shuddered, stepped to 
the wall, and turned a redly glowing knob on the visemo's tuning 
dial. Instantly the room became 
silent and dark. 

"John!" exclaimcJ his wife. 
"What have you done?" 

He waited a moment. Then, as 
he heard Mary and Bob stirring, 
fright in thcL- movements, he 
grasped a blue knob, and gave it 
a full turn. 

Music flowed into die room, and 
the screen was fdled with the piclure of a Negro woman, her eyes 
closed, singing Ave Maria, The 
deep richness of her voice rose 
and fell, vibrant with the feeling 
of dusk and dawn, the passing of 
the seasons, and the growing life 
of all things. There was warmth 
and well-being in the glowing voice 
tone, and beneath the ebb and flow 
of the softly crying strings throbbed pain and grief and longing. 

Mallory watched the faces of 
the three. His wife, stared in silence at the screen, her mouth tight. 
The boy watched with his eyes open 
wide. Mary was smiling faintly, 
losing herself it seemed in the flow 



NORMAL 39 

of sound and in the dark, sad face 
of the singer. 

///.!/ to see Mary's face, thought 
Mallory, justifies all the years of 
Waiting. He sat down. 

The movement startled his wife. 

"I can't stand it," she said. 

Bob jumped to his feet. "What 
program is that, Dad?" 

Mary said, "It's beautiful. It's 
so beautiful." 

"Turn it off," said Helen, 

Mallory pressed the blue butlon. 
Tli & voice died, and the screen became a dark half circle of wall. 

"Now turn on the other picture." 
His wife's voice was trembling. 

"No, Helen, I won't," he said 
quietly. 

"Why?" she demanded. 

"Because I can't stand it anymore," was his firm reply. 

She sliook her head. There was 
a wildness in the motion. "I've got 
to know what's happening to us. 
If only wc could be quiet and 
happy again! But we don't know 
what happiness means anymore. 
Why can't we just get back to the 
way it was before the children were 
born. The pictures were so peaceful then. They were all about the 
food and the clothes and the refrigerators. They were all about 
the new furniture and how the 
styles had changed — just peaceful 
news about how people had everything they needed. 

"And then the pictures began 
to be different. Now and then — 
just for a minute. Like the pictures we saw this morning. And 



40 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



slowly the changed pictures became 
more frequent. But they were coming from the center. That convinced 
us they must be all right, and we 
accepted them. Then, as time went 
on, I began to feel uneasy about 
them and later a little bit excited. 
Then I became terribly excited. 
And then for the first time, this 
morning, I couldn't stand the pictures changing back and forth. 

"We were watching a food program, for the lunch menu. It was 
demonstrating a new way to cook 
beef stew, different from anything 
we'd ever even imagined before. 
We got so hungry that I reached 
out to press the food button. Then 
the picture chdnged, the way it always does. A man was talking. He 
said something about the oceans 
and the crash of water on rocks. 
The picture was still, but he talked 
about the movement in it. Another 
picture showed a big dark rock and 
at the bottom it was green. The 
voice talked about bushes and trees 
and the sky and a mountain. 

"I just remember the words. And 
there was another one all blueblack with dots of white and, 
strange-looking square structures 
and at the bottom it was green, 
too. The voice talked about bashes 
and trees and the sky and a mountain again. I just remember the 
words." 

"You've seen pictures like this 
before," Mallory said quietly. 

"Yes," his wife acknowledged. 
"But they made me feel different 
this time. It was as if two awful 



forces were pulling me in opposite 
directions, as if I were being torn 
apart. I had to do something. So 
I told Mary and Bob to get ready 
and we'd go to the psychology center. It's what we've always been told 
to do if we ever felt sick." 

Mallory stood very still, restraining an impulse to go to her and 
comfort her. Never before in their 
lives had there been the need for 
comfort or sympathy between them. 
But only he could understand her 
need now, from the books he had 
read and from his own yearning 
for sympathy throughout the long 
years. She wouldn't understand, he 
told himself. She would feel only 
shock and fear. 

As he started to speak, he felt 
Mary's hand brushing his sleeve. 
Bob moved to the side of his 
mother and stood there quietly, as 
though he had lost something. 

But the children understand, he 
thought — instinctively. Visemo hasn't saturated them yet. 

He smiled wryly. "I know what 
they said to you, at the psychology 
center. They told you that many 
of the broadcasts you were getting 
weren't sanctioned by the control 
board. They said somebody was 
feeding you mental and emotional 
poison." 

She nodded. 

"It's true," he said, "about some 
of the broadcasts not being sanctioned. They weren't. I'm responsible." 

Helen covered her face with her 
hands. 



BACK TO NORMAL 



"But it's the sanctioned broadcasts that are the mental and emotional poison," he said. 

"I don't know what to believe. 
I don't know." 

"Look, Helen," he said. "I've 
got to show you — tonight. I've got 
to explain." 

"They said I was supposed to 
spy on you. They said you might 
be—" 

,He looked at her. "Insane?" 
"Yes." 

"But you can't spy on me," he 
told her, gently. 

"I want to," she said. "But at 
[he same time I want to— to help 
you. I want to comfort you if you're 
sick. But some of the pictures on 
visemo seem to be saying nobody 
can be sick and others show people 
helping the sick. Some of the pictures show people being unhappy, 
and others make us forget all that 
and show people always happy. It's 
as if the pictures lie to each other. 
And — I feci the same way, as if 
I'm lying to myself." 

"You've never wanted to help 
anyone before, have you," he 
asked. 

For a long moment she thought. 
Then she shook her head. "No, 
I never have." 

"But now you uuirii to help me." 

"Yes. In a way. I — " 

"Wait." He held up. his hands. 
"Your yes is true. That's enough. I 
desperately need your help. Sometime diis evening — it could be any 
time — the Mayor and the psychologist will come into this room to 



see how the stepped-up power of 
their broadcast has affected us. 
What they see will decide whether 
we will be allowed to go on together or be separated forever and 
changed into other people ... 1 
want us to go on together." 

Mallory could feel his daughter 
moving closer to him. He watched 
with concern his wife sink into a 
chair in indecision, while his son 
knelt solicitously beside her. 

"Before the Mayor and the psychologist get here I want to take 
you out on the surface of the 
Earth," he said. 

"But it's — it's death on the surface," exclaimed Helen, alarm in 
her voice. 

He rose, walked to the far end 
of the room and knelt down. He 
took the disk of metal out of his 
pocket. 

"A long time ago, I made this 
torch," he said. "It dissolves the 
wall in a thin line, wherever I 
plate a mark. It's very much the 
same as drawing a pencil line and 
where the line is, there's space. I 
made a door here in this spot — 
leading to the outside. I've gone 
out on the surface of the Earth 
for many years. And I'm still alive. 
When I came back, I set the section of wall in place again. Then 
I changed the instrument and 
sealed the wall shut." 

"You mean, said Helen, awe in 
her voice, "you've been going out 
here at night while we were 
asleep?" 

"I bad to see the outside," he 



42 FANTASTIC 

told hat, "Man has walled himself 
away from lite and beauty. He's 
imprisoned his mind and feelings 
in the cruel iron walls of the visemo." He nodded, "I had to show 
you more than this living death. I 
had to bring you out under the 
sky." 

Mallory knelt down and ran the 
instrument around a three-foot 
square area in the wall. The piece 
of stone, lead and metal, remained 
stationary foe a long moment. Then 
it fell outward. 

Instantly Mary scurried toward 
the oval of darkness. 

"No!" Helen cried out in frantic warning. "No!" 

The girl stopped, looking defiantly back over her shoulder. 

"All you'll find out there," said 
Mallory, "is beauty and freedom. 
And the sky and stars!" 

"But I'm afraid," said Helen. "I 
don't know — " 

Then Bob said, "Dad, I can smell 
the freshness." He bent down, staring out into the night. "I can see 
dots of light up toward the top." 

"All my life," said Helen, her 
voice seeming to come from a 
great distance, "I've been here — 
inside the city. I was told never to 
leave and I was happy here. Wc 
can turn on the visemo and watch 
it and — forget about out there. 
We'd be happy again." 

Maliory shook his head, and 
stepped back from her. 

"There's something I've got to 
say. I suppose if I had dared to 
say it before I'd never be able to 



UNIVERSE 

say it now. I'm going out there — 
and if I go alone I won't be back." 

He turned to the boy who was 
looking from him to his mother, 
a frantic longing growing in his 
face. The girl readied out and took 
Mallory's hand, holding it tightly. 
The woman was staring at the 
floor. 

Mallory felt the small hand 
tremble faintly, as though his 
daughter were anticipating a leap. 
Gently he tightened his grasp on 
her hand, bent down and stepped 
out into the night. 

Ill 

As Mallory straightened up, 
he heard Mary's breath catch in her 
throat. Looking down at her, he 
saw the moonlight bright on her 
face. Incredibly her face seemed to 
be floating in space, just below his 
shoulder. Her eyes were wide, reflecting pinpoints of light, and her 
lips were barely parted and her 
breathing was quiet. 

She said, "Oh," and was silent 
again, her slight body moving 
across the swirled ocean of light 
points. Slowly Mallory turned his 
eyes to the oval of light in the 
cupola wall. It was empty. 

He saw a lighted oval of grass 
glistening with drops of dew. At 
the same time, he was aware that 
Mary was staring in silence and 
wonder at the tangled treelops 
black against the moon-washed 
sky. 

He had been sure at least that 



BACK TO NORMAL 



his son would follow. He could 
not go back to a house thai could 
never be a home. And he could 
not continue on. Not with jusl 
Mary. How could he abandon a 
woman and a boy whom he loved 
more than his own life in the cupola. 

Then suddenly he saw Bob, a 
shadow with the light at his back, 
kneeling in the opening. The next 
moment, he was standing beside 
his father. 

After a long time, he said, "It's 
— like being in a big room. You 
can't see the walls, but you know 
they have to be there." And then 
he too was watching the depth of 
the night sky. 

"What was your mother doing," 
Mai lory asked, "when you came 
out?" 

"She was just standing, looking 
down at the floor," Bob said. "I'm 
going back in a few minutes." His 
voice trembled on the edge of crying. "Are you really going away 
for good, Dad ? Will you take Mary 
with you?" 

Mallory held his eyes on the oval 
of light. "I don't know, son. I 
thought she'd come out with us. 
I was almost sure of it." 

"She won't," said the boy. 
"She's too scared. You can't blame 
her, Dad. I was so scared coming 
out I thought I'd faint. And now 
it's — so wonderful. But Tve got to 
go back." 

Mallory was silent. He could tell 
himself that his wife, Kick in the 
room, had made her choice and 



that her decision had been inevitable. He could tell himself that 
she had chosen to stay in the narrow prison of the city, caught in 
the death trap of the visemo. Surely it was better (hat a man and his 
children should be alive under the 
sky than imprisoned with the living 
dead in a tomb of walls sunk deep 
into the ground. But the struggle 
within him raged unabated. 

He looked deeply into the darkness among the sdent trees under 
the silent sky. Why could he not 
summon the courage to seal the 
opening quickly, before that fierce 
inner struggle left him standing on 
this one spot forever. 

As he bent down to lift the displaced piece of wall into place, 
Helen's shadow fell abruptly across 
it, And then she was in the opening, the darkness and the moonlight 
on her pale face. 

Gently he said, "Helen," and 
reaching down, grasped the hand 
which she held up to him. 

As she stood beside him, he 
ton Id feel her trembling She 
raised her face to the sky, a wild 
surmise in her eyes. "I had to 
come," she said. "I couldn't go on 
living without you." 

"We — wouldn't have left ycu," 
he lied. 

"After you'd all gone and I was 
standing there alone, I seemed lo 
feel the walls pressing against me. 
The whole house felt dead. It was 
as if you'd all been swallowed — 
and then I knew I had to come out 
to you."

Quietly Mallory began to tell 
them about the surface world. He 
told them how the diy and night 
came and went with miraculous 
regularity and how the stars floated in a sea of space that stretched 
into distances that were lost in some 
infinite vastness without beginning 
or end. 

He spoke of the moon which 
was so close and of its reflected 
light, and of the sun that would 
be shining life on the Earth all 
through the long day that waited 
beyond the darkness. And he described the great floating galaxies 
beyond their sight, the star clusters, 
the white dwarf suns and the giant 
yellow ones. 

They stood there for a long time 
in the coolness listening to him as 
he talked about the even greater 
wonders he had discovered from 
the books in the sunken vault of 
stone — about the seasons of the 
Earth and how the blades of grass 
grew by absorbing nourishment 
from the soil and the trees, and the 
crops which man had once cultivated upon the Earth. 

They heard about the mammals 
and insects, the birds, the swarming life in the oceans. They listened 
in awe as he told them about the 
rolling surging waters over the face 
of the Earth, and the mountain 
ranges thrusting up into the sky, 
and the layer of air that was the 
Earth's atmosphere. 

And as they listened, there came 
lo them a more complete understanding of the death they had 



UNIVERSE 

thought of as life within the press 
of the walls. But now the joy they 
were experiencing deepened their 
need for life ever more abundant, 
and they desired only to walk upon 
the Earth, and be a part of the 
birth-and-growth cycle that after all 
the years was rising and spreading 
there again. 

Mallory stopped talking. 

They listened to the buzzing and 
humming of insects and to a breeze 
that had begun to flow among the 
trees. They listened to the rustle 
and the sighing; and from behind 
the hills there came to them, on 
the eddying currents of wind, the 
crash of the ocean surf breaking 
against beach and rocks. They 
smelted the fresh, clean smell of 
dew-washed leaves and grass, moist 
Earth and night-blooming flowers. 

Ami then suddenly Mary said, 
"Let's never go back in the house 
again." 

Helen started, and looked at her 
daughter, a growing wonder in her 

eyes. 

"What are we going to do, 
John?" she asked. 

"We could go out on the Earth," 
said Mallory. 

With awe in his voice, Bob said, 
"There'd be trees to climb and the 
ground to dig in. I could climb the 
hills and maybe we could build a 
boat and sail on the ocean — like 
the men in some of those pictures 
you showed us on the visemo. Could 
we do all that, Dad?" 

"Yes," said Mallory. "All that 
and more." 



BACK TO 

"I could take off all my clothes," 
exclaimed Mary. "I could wade in 
the ocean and swim, like we saw 
people doing in the pictures. I 
could walk and walk in the grass 
and I could watch the stars every 
night and the birds every day.'' 

Then Helen said, "We could 
have a house with windows in it— 
red windows. We saw people looking out of windows in the visemo. 
And this glorious fresh air would 
come right into my house." 

"Yes," said Mallory. "But — 
there's something else." 

He stared at the dark ground. 
"There are other people back in 
the city. I could keep on working 
at the visemo center and I could 
wire it into another circuit, just as 
J wired ours. I could show other 
families what life on the surface is 
like. Perhaps I could even take 
another family out on some night 
like this." 

"It's hard to understand you, 
John,"' said Helen quietly. 

"They are trapped now, victims 
of their own fear, their own lack 
of knowledge. But if I could open 
their eyes and show them what it 
means to be free under the 
stars — " 

They all stared at him, waiting. 

"We've got a responsibility. The 
people in the cities are under sentence of death. The visemo will 
eventually rob them of the will to 
live. There will be mass suicides — 
unless I have the courage and 
strength of purpose to do something about it." 



NORMAL 4.5 

"I don't want to go back," said 
Mary, raising her face again to the 
sky. 

Helen turned away from him. 
"We hardly know any of the other 
people in the city. Why should 
you sacrifice your own happiness to 
help them?" 

"We could have a swell time out 
here," said Bob. "We don't need 
anybody else." 

"There's something I'd like to 
show you on the visemo," said 
Mallory. "You've never seen it. 
But I think you ought to." 

His eyes were on the stars. 

"But the Mayor and the psychologist will be coming soon," said 
Helen, alarm in her voice. "If they 
catch us — " 

"I think we should risk it. I 
think we've got to." 

Helen looked up at the sky again 
and around at the dark trees gently 
swaying in the night breeze. Then 
without a word she took Mary by 
the hand and moved back toward 
the lighted opening. 

IV 

Mallory closed the door of the 
great, stone vault and returned 
through the night to his cupola, 
which glowed dully in the downstreaming moonlight. He carried 
a thin circular can under his arm. 
Crawling through the oval opening, 
he replaced the removed slab of 
wall, and sealed it into position 
with the disk of steel that had cut 
it open. Then he went to the wall 



46 FANTASTIC 

at the edge of the now dark visemo 

eye. 

Helen and Mary and Bob sat 
watching him as he opened a door 
and stepped behind a screen. After 
a minute, he came out and sat down 
beside tficm. 

"This is one of the old pictures," 
he said. "It was taken a long time 
ago, before the underground cities 
were built." Reaching out, he 
turned a knob on the visemo's tuning dial. 

As the lights dimmed, brightness flooded the screen and the picture swam into focus. A long 
needle-nosed torpedo propelled by 
flame hung tilted upwards against 
a blue-black sky swimming with 
white starpoints. The nose of the 
torpedo tilted downward and far 
below could be seen the lighted 
skyline of a great city. The lights 
began slowly to go out in sections 
until the city was a mountain of 
darkness. 

A spurt of flame burst open the 
pilcd-up darkness and white-hot 
lightning flared. A blinding mountain of fire sprang up and billowed 
out in a great orange flower that 
spouted a smoke column a thous■ and feet high. Then the orange fire 
faded and the column stood like 
a giant tree, burned black. 

Now the picture changed on the 
screen to a rubble-piled city. An 
ocean of smoke hung above it fed 
by a thousand rising streams of 
dark vapor. And there were people 
crawling in the rubble, digging 
deeply for the injured and dying 



UNIVERSE 

and carrying them from the piled 
ashes and the hills of molten stone 
and steel. Carrying them out onto 
the scorched Earth and band tging 
them and speaking words of comfort to them when comfort was of 
scant avail. 

There were cries of agony and 
in the foreground a woman was 
sobbing softly. Long rivers of people, carrying the stricken survivors, 
were flowing sluggishly toward the 
horizon. 

But there were many who would 
not leave the radiation-saturated 
rubble of the city for the temporary 
safety of the horizon and chose instead to stay with the injured, quieting them with sedatives, and 
tending their wounds. And those 
who stayed were dying also, with 
the tragic victims of the disaster, 
even as they struggled to save 
them. 

The picture came into close focus. A man wrapping a bandage 
suddenly stopped and turned his 
face to the sky. His hands shook 
and then his whole body. He fell 
backwards and lay still. After a 
moment, amidst the piled and broken stone, a woman stepped to his 
side and listened with her ear 
pressed to his chest for a long moment. 

Then she turned to another man 
lying half bandaged against a 
shattered stone wall. She finished 
re-winding the bandage and read 
a note pinned on a blackened shirt 
front. With calm purposefulness 
she took a hypodermic needle from 



BACK TO NORMAL 



4? 



a bag slung over her shoulder, and 

administered a sedative injection. 
Nodding reassuringly, she sat close 
beside the man and talked to him 
quietly until his rigid face relaxed. 

Mallory reached toward the tuning dial again and the picture faded 
into the visemo's great staring eye. 
He did not speak but sat watching 
his wife and the two children. 

Suddenly Mary burst into tears 
and ran to her mother, sobbing 
against her neck. With tender 
solicitude Helen comforted her. 

Bob looked at his father and 
said, "That was— awful." 

Mallory nodded. "It was what 
drove the cities underground. It 
was the beginning of the kind of 
life we're living now. And you 
saw that there were men and women who stayed to help and risked 
death rather than run away." 

He pressed his son's hand. "Are 
we going to run away from our 
city, or are we going to stay and 
help? There's death here too. The 
dealh of minds, the slow destruction of the human heritage of 
beauty and wisdom and love. Man 
has created it, just as he created 
tile torpedo th.it dropped on the 
city. And there's something we can 
do about it . . . 

Suddenly the spot of light above 
the door glowed red, 

They all stared at it, as though 
it were an accusing eye watching 
them. 

Mallory leaned forward. "The 
Mayor and the psychologist are 
coming down the corridor," he said. 



"Now listen to me. You've got to 
do exactly as I say or we'll never 
*ee the sky again." 

They sat very still. 

"I'll turn on the visemo, '* Mallory said. "Watch it, and let me 
talk to them. Act as if you're so 
intent on the visemo that you can't 
even turn away for a second. The 
emotion and thought beams will 
be turned on too. Let yourself feel 
them as you've always done. And 
remember, they've got to go away 
satisfied that the increased power 
has made us incapable of rebellion, 
and completely normal from their 
distorted point of view." 

Mallory manipulated the tuning 
dial again, and a picture flashed 
on the screen of a cake being taken 
out of an oven by a white-coated, 
white-capped baker. The voice 
came, insistent, beguiling, "You'll 
like this creamy soft cake. Notice 
the smooth, white frosting and the 
mound of tempting whipped cream. 
Taste the sweetness — " 

Suddenly the door opened silently, and two men stepped across the 
threshold and stood there, observing Mallory and his family. 

The visemo voice flowed on, hypnotically. The image of the cake 
floated across the room, turning 
slowly. Lights shimmered over its 
surface, and an hour before, to 
Helen and the children, it would 
have been a vision of ecstasy spreading across the tongue and deep into 
the taste buds. 

The psychologist stepped for


4* 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ward and looked into the face of 
each of the seated visemo viewers. 

"They don't even follow me with 
their eyes," he said to the Mayor. 
"They're far too intent on the 
screen. Absolutely nothing else exists for them at the moment. I think 
we can be completely sure that 
their reactions are now normal." 

"You've no doubt at all?" asked 
the Mayor. 

"None whatever. The increase to 
power has brought them safely 
back." 

The Mayor stepped to the psychologist's side and peered into the 
four faces. "We still don't know 
what caused them to depart from 
the norm in the first place," he 
said. 

The psychologist frowned. 
"Well, no. The human mind is a 
strange instrument. Sometimes it 
goes off kilter without apparent 
reason. If it ever happens again — 
which I don't think ft will as we're 
a very well-adjusted society — we've 
got the remedy. It worked with 
these people, so we can be quite 
sure it will work with others. Just 
turn up the power of the visemo 
until the psychological distortion 
disappears." 

"It's a great d iscovery you've 
made. Doctor," said the Mayor. "I'll 
see that you get recognition." 

"Thank you," said the psychologist. "The satisfaction is reward 
enough, believe me." 

Mallory stirred. The Mayor looked at him quickly. "Mr. Mallory," 
he said. "You'll take over the vise


mo center in the morning, as 
usual." 

Softly, Mallory said, "Of course, 
Mr. Mayor. Of course." 

"Everything's all right, Mr. Mallory," said the psychologist reassuringly. "Just go on as you are. 
And if there's ever any change let 
me know. You, too, Mrs. Mallory 
— as you did today. Your complete 
frankness was very commendable. 
We're equipped to handle any 
changes which may occur and remedy them just as we ' did tonight. 
You understand that, I'm sure." 

Mrs. Mallory smiled faintly and 
nodded. 

"Just remember/' went on the 
psychologist, "nothing can happen 
to change you that we can't wipe 
away as if it had never happened 
. . . And so we'll say goodnight." 

The door silently opened again, 
and then closed. 

Mallory touched the tuning dial. 
The picture died and the thought 
and emotion beams faded and it 
was as though a fresh wind had 
blown through the room. 

His hand returned to the dial 
and Beethoven's Sixth Symphony 
surged around them. For a long 
time they listened to the beauty 
and the power of the music, enraptured by the joyfulness and (lie 
deep sorrow of it and the endless 
life of it. 

Mallory opened the wall again 
and let the moonlight and the freshness into the room. 

They all went out onto the F.arth 
and stood there, feeling the soft 



RACK TO 

ground beneath their feet, smelling 
the night air, looking up into the 
sky and all around at the dark gently swaying trees and bushes and 
grass that, unknown to man, had 
silently come back to life through 
the long years. 

And as they stood there, the music from the room flowed out and 
around them and mingled with the 



NORMAL 49 

air and the green things in a 
great resistless surge of deathless 
beauty. 

Mallory, deeply aware of all this, 
was thinking of how he would begin on the morrow to change another circuit to some other family 
so that they, too, might know a 
new birth of freedom under the 
stars.

The strange, bewildering fragrance 
from the Flower Islands was as 
mysterious as life itself. And 
with it came desire — and death. 



" \Yhen she was seventeen Milliccnt Clarke had picked up the thin 
volume of her young life entitled, 
"Men," closed It firmly, and placed 
it on the mental shel f labe led 
"Books I'll Never Read Again." 

At the time it had seemed a logical classification, but several years 
later when she was majoring in 
anthropology she found that she 
had to take the book down again 
now and then for purposes of reference. As a feeling of frustration 
usually accompanied the act, it was 
not surprising that she came eventually to specialize in matrilincal 
societies. The more markedly matrilineal they were, the belter she liked 
them. 

The present society was positively fascinating. Not only was it 
markedly matri Lineal, but it subsisted on an Elysian land mass the 
equal of which Millicent had never 
seen in any of her previous planetary field work. 

Topographically, the land mass 
was a paradox. In one sense it was 
an imposing continent, and in another it was nothing more than an 
emaciated island. It was more than 



So lyrical in mood and so rich in poetic imagery is this astounding fictional 
excursion into the still largely unexplored realm of comparative ethnology 
that the profundity of its underlying premise may at first escape you. But 
we urge that you ponder that premise long and earnestly, for in a kind of 
glorified nutshell Robert Young has encapsulated the entire tragedy of human 
life on this planet, and shown us exactly what guilt feelings in juxtaposition 
with a cultural complex can do to human nature throughout Time and Space.

THE FIRST SWEET SLEEP OF NIGHT

a thousand miles in length, and it 
rose out of the Sapphire Sea on a 
line with the Fomalhaut 4 equator; 
but for all its length, its width never 
exceeded five miles. 

The north coast was scalloped 
with white beaches. Hills began 
modestly as sand dunes, acquired 
trees and grass farther inland, rose 
ever and ever higher and finally 
dropped, in abrupt cliffs, to the line 
of jagged rocks that comprised the 
south coast. The wind crashed the 
sea against the rocks from morning 
to night. It had never slackened 
nor changed direction during the 
two Terran months since the subsidiary camp had been established, 
and Milliccnt had begun to doubt 
if it ever would. 

However, Mi II tc en t 1 iked the 
windless days of the leeward side. 
The temperature was consistently 
comfortable, so there wasn't really 
any need for a wind, though occasionally a fragment of moving air 
did surmount the barrier of the 
cliffs and come tiptoeing over the 
grassy hills to the encampment. One 
came up behind her now and 
caressed her short brown hair. 

But she hardly noticed. She was 
too engrossed with her journal . . . 

/ am beginning to think (she 
wrote) that we have stumbled 
upon a pure matrilineal society, although Dr. Vertor does not agree 
with me, and Dr. liauley mode the 
comment, in his usual sarcastic maniter, that 1 have arrived ai a typically subjective conclus'wn t referring 



no doubt to my absorption with my 
chosen specially. 

Nevertheless, postulating a pure 
susu throws ai least some light upon 
our present impasse. If the present 
susu is undiluted, as I think, it is 
unprecedented in our experience 
and our inability to comprehend it 
stems largely from our tendency to 
use previous diluted susus for criteria — 

"Iced tea, Dr. Clarke?" 

Startled, Millicent looked up. 
"Oh— Oh, thank you, Dr. Han ley. 
I was just catching up on my 
notes." She accepted the tall frosted glass and set it on the arm of 
the tent chair. 

"Gloria made it," Dr. Hanley 
said. "She and Vcstor and I arc 
going to play a few games of Martian canasta in the mess tent. Care 
to join us?" 

"Oh, no," Milliccnt said. "I 
really have to finish tliis entry." 

He looked at her quizzically, his 
gray eyes laughing and yet not 
laughing at all. It was an unanalytial mannerism that had made her 
dislike him all through college and 
all during their field work together. 
He mu'-t have sensed her annoyance. 

"Okay, I only asked," he said. 
"By the way, you know it's Saturday afternoon, don't you?" 

He turned and walked away. 

Primarily such a population gives 
us our frst clear insight into the 
predominant paradox of the pres


52 



FANTASTIC VN1VERSB 



tni culture — the out 'standing dearth 
of mules. While it jails to resolve 
the problem of what physical cause 
lies behind this dearth, it eliminates the paradoxical element of the 
result, for what could be more logical than that the females of a pure 
susu should overwhelmingly outnumber the males of a pure susu? 

Such a population does not, unfortunately, explain the cyclic age 
groups of both females and males, 
but it does provide us with a sound 
foundation upon which to erect the 
structure of our culture study . . . 

Saturday afternoon — 

It was so silly to compute nonTerran time by the Terran calendar, Millicent thought. Particularly when you were on a planet whose 
orbital velocity was so insignificant 
that its year equalled almost twenty 
of Terra's. She laid her notebook 
on her lap and picked up the glass 
of iced tea. 

Saturday afternoon — 

At her feet the hill on which the 
subsidiary camp stood dropped 
gently down to the shore of the 
blue cove. The native village 
sprawled lazily on the white sand, 
and native fishing boats speckled 
the placid water like basking water 
spiders. Beyond the cove, the 
Sapphire Sea spread out in sparkling 
wastes to the low-lying Flower Islands. 

She sipped the iced tea slowly, 
letting its flavor linger in her 
mouth. Her mind skipped back a 
dozen years to the patio of her 



father's summer home, and she saw 
her father sitting by the rose trellis with his eternal volume of 
Shelley, and she saw herself, a little 
girl sitting in a sequestered corner 
with her books . . . 

The memory should have been 
pleasant, but it was rather horrible 
instead. Millicent set the glass on 
the ground and stood up. She decided to let her notes go till evening; somehow she didn't feel like 
writing any more. 

Laughter and the tinkle of ice 
cubes came from the nearby mess 
tent. Tor a moment she considered 
joining the three players, then she 
thought of Gloria Mitchell. Gloria 
Mitchell was the group's secretary; 
she was blonde and chic and read 
confession comics. She was just 
about the last person in the world 
you would have expected staid anthropologists like Dr. Vestor and 
Dr. il.mley to choose for a secretary. 

Suddenly Millicent hated the 
camp. She felt as though she couldn't endure it for another second. 
After returning her journal to her 
tent, she started walking back into 
the hills. 

She climbed her favorite hill and 
sat clown beneath her favorite tree 
and gazed out over the Sapphire 
Sea to the Flower Islands. The 
pounding of the waves against the 
jagged feet of the cliffs came softly 
to her ears. 

She forced her wandering 
thoughts into anthropological 
channels, concentrating on the na


THE FIRST SWKBT SLEEP OF NIGHT 



53 



tivc village on the shore of ihc 
cove. There were hundreds of 
similar villages, all of them 
matriarchies, scattered along the 
northern littoral, but one was 
enough for her purposes. 

She thought of the incredibly 
beautiful people she had seen, and 
wondered for the thousandth time 
why they avoided sex. Especially 
the men. As far as Millicent had 
been able to ascertain they actually 
shunned the nubile women, fishing 
alone by day, and staying close to 
the susus of their own families by 
night. It was as though sex did not 
exist. 

And yet, obviously enough, it 
did exist. 

The sound of the waves against 
the cliffs was soporific. Millicent 
Stifled a small yawn. With an effort, 
she concentrated on the village 
again. 

The apparent absence of sex was 
only a minor problem, but it was 
directly related to the major problem of the age groups. The fact 
that none of the natives was under twenty Terran years of age was 
puzzling enough. But it was only 
a poild incongruity compared to the 
additional fact that none of the 
men was over twenty years of age, 
and that the women ranged from 
twenty to forty to sixty years of 
age, with no intermediate age 
groups. 

That certainly indicated a twenty 
year sexual cycle. Or a one year 
sexual cycle, computing it in Fomalhaut 4 time. Which was the way 



it should be computed, Millicent 
reminded herself sleepily. But no 
matter how you computed it, two 
irreconcilable questions remained — 
what had caused the cycle in the 
ii est place, and what happened to 
the men when they passed the 
cyclic age of one, or twenty? 

She yawned again. The hilltop 
was so tranquil, the pounding of 
the waves so remote, so unreal; 
soft, and growing ever softer . . . 

She must have dozed off for, 
suddenly, Dr. Hanley was standing 
there, tall and willowy against a 
sky that had faded from deep blue 
to wan gray. She sat up abruptly, 
rubbing her eyes. 

"Why," she said, "I must have 
dropped off!" 

"We looked all over for you 
back at camp. Gloria got a bad 
attack of stomach cramps and when 
Vestor radioed main base the 
M.D. said to bring her in in the 
launch. He thought it might be 
appendicitis." 

"Oh, I'm sorry," Millicent said. 
"I should have been there." 

"Vestor wanted you to go along. 
He didn't want to leave the two 
of us here alone, and yet he couldn't take me along because that 
would have left you completely 
alone. But he's coming right 
back." 

Millicent stood up. There was 
a strange stillness in the air. "I'm 
afraid I don't quite follow your 
line of reasoning. Dr. Hanley." 

The mirthless laughter was in 
his eyes again, mocking her. "It's 



54 FANTASTIC 

very simple, Dr. Clarke," he said. 
"Vestor was merely concerned over 
your reputation. There is a quality 
about foursomes that renders them 
inviolate to the workings of malicious minds. When, however, the 
foursome is reduced to a twosome, 
the quality disappears. 

"Our esteemed co-workers are 
probably bored to death with the 
lugubrious nordic culture they are 
dissecting and will be delighted to 
hear that a male and a female 
anthropologist have been left all 
alone on a tropical island with 
nothing but the light of stars to 
chaperon them. It will give them 
something to talk about besides 
traits and ancestral backgrounds, 
and climatic cycles as they affect 
mass pattern deviations." 

Milliceni felt the abrupt hotness 
of her face. "I assure you, Dr. Hanley," she said between tight lips, 
"that there'll be no substantiation 
for whatever contemptible little lies 
they invent concerning us!" 

"I'm sure there won't be." The 
laughter was gone from his eyes. 
"We'd better be getting back to 
camp, don't you think? I'm sure 
you must have some new data to 
enter into your journal," 

"I certainly have!" 

She followed him down the 
hill. The stillness seemed to increase with each passing moment. 
There was something wrong about 
it, a subtle wrongncss that Millicent couldn't put her finger on till 
they reached the h i 11 where the 



universe 

camp stood. And then, abruptly, she 
realized what it was. 

The pounding of the waves 
against the cliffs had ceased. 

Suddenly she felt the first Wftfflu 
breath of moving air and knew 
that the wind had changed. 

It was coming from the 
north . . . 

They ate in silence, facing each 
other across the narrow table in the 
mess tent. The only sounds were 
the sporadic whirring of the generator below the crest of the hill, 
and the rushing sound of the wind. 

Dr. Hanley finished his toffee 
and stood up. "I don't want to 
keep you away from your notes," 
he said, "Don't split any infinitives 
now." He walked out into the wind, 
his shoulders held straight. 

She sat there furious for some 
time. Then she started back to her 
tent. The wind was a sweet river 
of air flowing in over the sea. It 
rushed round her warm and cool, 
tugging at her bobbed hair, trying 
vainly to send it swirling about her 
face and neck. She paused before 
the mess tent, breathing deeply. 
There was another scent blended 
with the salt-scent of the sea — 
the musky perfume of the Flower 
Islands, Millicent had breathed it 
only once before, but she had never 
forgotten it. 

It seemed to pervade her entire 
body, and for a moment she feh 
vertiginous. The wind flattened her 
slacks against her thighs, napped 
her jacket wildly. Below, on the 
shore of the cove, she could see the 



THE FIRST SWEET SLEEP OF NIGHT 



55 



lights of the village, and she heard 
the new sound of surf on sand. 

She walked slowly toward her 
tent. Dr. Haniey's tent was in darkness and he was nowhere to be 
seen. She guessed that he was probably visiting the village again, for 
in his own way he was as concerned with the culture problem as 
she was. 

She switched on her tent light 
and tied the flaps. Undaunted, the 
wind slipped beneath the canvas 
walls and filled the interior with 
its heady scent. She got her journal 
out of the locker, sat down at the 
table, and riffled through the pages. 
An entry caught her eye: 

In typical matrilined societies, 
once the male is forced into marridge he is under the dud obligation 
of both his bride's susu and his 
mother's susu. He must provide for 
both households but he is not permitted to live in either, that of his 
mother having cast him out because 
be deserted it for smother, and that 
of his bride having cast him out 
because the bride's mother is SO 
fiercely possessive that she cannot 
endure giving h/m even enough 
floor space upon which to sleep. 
There are incidents, in societies of 
this sort, of males committing suicide because of their refection by 
their communities ... ,\ 

Was it possible, Millicent wondered, for the males of a pure susu 
to be driven to commit mass suicide? She shook her head. No, it 



wasn't likely. Not without some 
other influencing factor— some circumstance of environment, of climate or topography. 

The rushing sound of the wind 
was mesmerizing. She sat there listening to it, the entry blurring before her eyes. Presently she heard 
the distant murmur of voices, of 
voices raised in lilting song. She 
untied the flap and peered out, The 
hills were awash with pale starlight. The native village seemed to 
be spreading; flickering lights were 
everywhere, expanding in a widening semi-circle into the hills. 

The flap slipped from her fingers and whipped wildly beside her. 
The fragrance of the Flower Islands was all around her. She 
swayed, Everything was unreal, and 
yet real in a way that transcended 
reality, that made ordinary reality 
a mockery, a progression of cold, 
loveless days. 

I mustn't let myself go, she whispered to the wind. I mustn't! 

The desperate fingers of her 
mind seized upon her notes and 
she ran back to the table, riffled 
her journal to the last entry, and 
began to write. She wrote without 
thinking, and the lines emerged 
from her subconscious, materializ-! 
ing on the page.

She stared at the words in horror, fighting back the hated memory that had gained a foothold in 
her mind. Abruptly she got up and 

ran out into the night. 

All around her in the hills women were carrying flaming torches. 
Their faces were exotic in the reddish radiance, their lips moved in 
soft beckoning song. The wind sent 
their dark hair drifting about their 
naked shoulders, made swirling 
mist out of their garments. Some 
of them wandered through the 
camp, but though they looked right 
at her they did not see her. 

Presently Millicent saw the men. 
They walked as though dreaming, 
tall and lithe, their bodies flowing 
in the unreasonable night. At first 
she could not believe their faces, 
fot their faces were beautiful. 

And then she saw Dr. Hanky, 
and his face was beautiful, too. 
Ucautiful — and frightening. 

She shrank back into the shadow 
of the lent and watched him pass. 
I Ic walked the way the natives 
walked, as though he did not know 
he walked at all. The first soft mist 
of spring had touched the grayness 
. of his eyes. He passed her very 
ilo.se, but he did not see her, and 
then he descended the southern 
slope of the hill. The wind fluttered the collar of his khaki jacket 
and ruffled his light brown hair. 

The wind. The scented north 
wind — 

Suddenly Millicent understood 
the behavior pattern of the culture. 
Tn one lucid second the whole array 



UNIVERSE 

of paradoxes dissolved into a crystal clear sequence of cause and 
effect . . . 

During the last lap of the southward flight, the launch had passed 
over the Flower Islands and everyone had been fascinated by the 
polychromatic patterns that floated 
like riotous nosegays on the face of 
the Sapphire Sea. No one had given 
a thought to the musky fragrance 
that drifted subtly through the 
open vents. 

The phrase "Flower Islands" 
leaped to everyone's lips at once, 
and later the place-name was entered on Dr. l-Ianley's Fomalhatit 
4 map. In addition to the unanimous voicing of the place name, 
several other incidents occurred in 
quick succession. 

Dr. Vestor put his arm around 
Gloria Mitchell 's shoulders, and 
leaned over and kissed her on the 
mouth. Instead of resisting, Gloria 
Mitchell responded passionately. 

Dr. Hanley said: "I didn't laugh, 
Milli. I wasn't one of the ones who 
laughed." 

Millicent answered: "I know. 
But all the others laughed and 
that's what destroyed It." 

"But I didn't laugh, Milli. I 
tried to tell you so many times, 
but you'd never listen. You'd always withdraw into yourself and 
I'd find myself talking to a shell 
of a woman. That's why I slopped 
trying—" 

"The others laughed and that 
was the end of it. Can't you un


THE FIRST SWEET 

derstand that? Can't you see why 
it had to be the end?" 

"No, I'll never understand . . ." 

His voice trailed away and the 
softness that had come into his eyes 
disappeared. Abruptly Millicent 
blushed and wondered why she 
hadn't blushed before. She noticed 
then that Dr. Vestor's arm was 
no longer around Gloria Mitchell's 
shoulders, that he was sitting stiffly 
in the pilot's seat, his neck the 
color of a tropical sunset. The 
Flower Islands were far behind, 
and the automatic controls were 
guiding the launch toward the 
elongated land mass that showed 
in the distance. 

They had landed a short time 
later and had gone about establishing the subsidiary camp as though 
nothing unusual had occurred. The 
incident had never been mentioned, 
as though by tacit agreement, and 
Millicent had carefully kept it 
from trespassing upon her 
thoughts. Until now — 
The flower Islands were uninhibited. For the first time she realized why they were uninhabited. 

No race of people could possibly 
adapt itself to such a milieu. 

But a race of people could adapt 
itself to the land mass to the south 
— if the prevailing wind was from 
the south. If it were a normal race, 
its sexual cycle would be influenced, 
though not necessarily determined, 
by the number of times the wind 
shifted to the north. 

An extremely matriarchal race, 
however, would react somewhat 



SLEEP OF NIGHT 57 

differently — as in "the present instance. When the wind was from 
die south, sex was avoided by the 
men because marriage was synonymous with social death. But when 
the wind shifted to the north, the 
aphrodisiacal fragrance which it 
carried southward from the Flower 
Islands was enough to overcome 
their fear of social death and send 
them off in pursuit of the nubile 
women who, already affected, had 
wandered into the hills, crooning 
tribal love songs to lure prospective suitors. 

From the evidence of the age 
groups, it was clear that the wind 
changed direction for a brief period once every Fomalhaut 4 year. 
But the limited longevity of the 
men indicated that another factor 
was involved. That factor had to 
be topography. 

Fear of social death, Millicent 
realized, was not enough in itself 
to cause a man to kill himself. But 
abetted by the right symbolical interpretation of, his milieu, it could 
be more than enough. All primitive- races were in some measure 
influenced by the topography of 
their native habitat. 

In some cases they were inordinately influenced. From the 
perspective of an observer the present land mass was merely unusual. 
But from the perspective of the 
natives who lived and died on it, 
in whose eyes it constituted the 
entire universe, it equalled life and 
death and was symbolically interpreted according to those terms. 



58 FANTASTIC 

The beaches and the coves of 
the north coast represented life, 
since all sustenance for life came 
from the sea and from the sands 
bordering the sea. The hills, possibly because of their superficial 
resemblance to virginal breasts, 
were the fertility symbol, the place 
where all life was reproduced. And 
the cliffs— 

The cliffs symbolized death. 
The topographical interpretation 
of existence, therefore, was life, 
reproduction, and death, death lor 
the men immediately following the 
reproductive act because of the association of the hills with the cliffs, 
and the parallel association of the 
idea of marriage With the idea of 
social death, 

Taken separately, neither association would have been strong 
enough ..to evoke the suicide response. But taken together, they 
made the death-wish inevitable . . . 

The last of the natives had 
passed, Dr. Hanley was a barely 
discernible figure moving up the 
starlit slope of the next hill. 

"Dr. Hanley," Millicent shouted, "Dr. Hanley!" 

He did not pause. He surmounted the star-kissed crest of the hill 
and started down the opposite 
slope. Torches danced like boated 
fireflies in the distance. 

She started to run after him. 
Then she paused. 

She looked down at her baggy 
jacket, at her uncompromising mannish slacks. She reached up and 
touched her short hair. She rcmcm


UNIVCRSE 

bered the gossamer garments of 
the native women and the way their 
long hair had drifted in the wind. 
She remembered their beautiful 
faces. 

She touched her own face, her 
cheeks, her mouth. She pressed her 
fingers against her lips, trying to 
soften their hard line, but [lie 
hardness would not go away. 

She couldn't change the expression of her face or the shortness 
of her hair. Nothing but time 
could do that. But there was something that she could do. She walked 
on numb feet to her tent and she 
opened her foot locker with numb 
hands. The dress was at the bottom where she had placed it— how 
long ago? 

Before that it had been at the 
bottom of a bureau drawer in a 
dormitory, and before that it had 
been at the bottom of another bureau drawer in another dormitory, 
and before that it had been at the 
bottom of a bureau drawer in her 
room where she had placed it on 
her seventeenth birthday. 

When she uncovered it the first 
thing she saw was the crumpled 
corsage of plastic violets, and that 
was when she began to cry. 

It was her seventeenth birthday 
and she was descending the staircase to the improvised ballroom. 
The polished floor was already 
aswirl with youthful dancers and 
the little orchestra in the corner 
was bravely playing "Roses from 
the South." 



THE FIRST SWEET SLEEP OF NIGHT 



59 



It was her seventeenth birthday 
and she had been reading "Lines 
to an Indian Air" in her room, 
glancing shyly, now and then, at 
her oval face in the mirror, listening to the pounding of her heart; 
touching the gossamer shoulder 
straps of her new white dress So 
reassure herself that they were real, 
that she was real, that the lovely 
night in June was real, and that 
she was really seventeen. 

It was her seventeenth birthday 
and it was her first dress, and it 
was the first time that she had ever 
dared to leave the enchanted universe of her books and .come out 
and inform the world that she, too, 
beneath her shapeless sweaters and 
her schoolgirl skirts, had been a 
woman all the time, and a beautiful 
woman too. 

Bruce was standing at the base 
of the stairs when she came down, 
his eyes absorbing her springtime 
loveliness — her soft child's face, the 
whiteness of her shoulders, the 
burgeoning swell of her breasts. 
The plastic violets above her heart 
had bloomed a springtime blue. 

He stepped forward, without a 
word, and took her in his arms, 
and together they floated away on 
the surf of the music. In the sweet 
sea of sound her shyness had left 
her, and she had almost become 
a woman. 

And then she had felt the abrupt 
coldness of her breasts, heard the 
first intimations of the laughter. 
She had looked down then, and 
seen the broken strap, and her 



nakedness, and felt the first searing 
blush of her shame. She had run 
across the gleaming floor, through 
the dancers and the mounting 
laughter, to the stairs, and wildly 
up the stairs to the cool virginal 
sanctuary of her room— 

Millicent was still crying when 
she slipped out of her clothes, She 
was crying when she mended the 
strap, crying when .^he slipped into 
the dress and felt its soft coolness 
against her flesh. She was trying 
when she left the tent and ran into 
the hills. 

The returning launch passed like 
a great dark bird above her, but 
she did not see it. Her shoes were 
ugly mannish things and she kicked them off and felt the soft moist 
grass beneath her bare feet. She 
ran on, feeling the dress against 
her body and the wind upon her, 
inhaling the fragrance that the wind 
carried, running swiftly beneath the 
sharp bright stars. And something 
deep within her broke and her tears 
stopped and the cool wind dried 
her eyes. 

Behind her someone was shouting her name, but she paid no 
attention. Her eyes were absorbed 
with star-washed valleys and pale 
slopes, eager for a glimpse of the 
familiar willowy figure of the man 
she loved. 

She overtook him finally. He 
was breasting a high hill and she 
was in the valley just below. 
"Bruce," she cried. "Bruce!" 

He heard her this time, and 



6o 



FANTASTIC UN1VERSH 



turned. When he saw her standing 
in the starlight lie ran stumbling 
down ihe hill. She collapsed in his 
arras. "I ran away," she said. "I 
ran away and I never stopped running. I'm so sorry, darling." 

There was the sound of pounding footsteps. Dr. Vestor was 
wearing an oxygen mask and he 
was tremendously excited. He raised 
the mask briefly when he came up 
to them. 

"No time for questions now," 
lie gasped. "Just put these on and 
follow me. We're going back to 
Main Base!" 

They donned (he masks he handed them. Then, hand in hand, they 
followed him back over the dwindling hills to the launch. 

Anthropologists, as a rt/!e, do 
not interfere with the pattern of a 
culture. But there are exceptions to 
every rule, and I think all of us 
were relieved to see the demolition 
crew board the launch this morning and head southward for the 
Flower Islands. 

I have just returned from sick 
bay and am happy to record that 
Miss /Mitchell's appendectomy was 
. a success. On his last visit to her, 
Dr. Vestor optimistically left her 
a copy of Pyczykiewicz's excellent 
Atypical Pantheistic Patterns of 
Certain Camelopardalis Cultures 
and she had the volume propped 
before her uihifl I came in, reading 



it with every indication of absorption. When she closed it, however, 

J defected the telltale yellow edg? 
of a confession comic protruding 
from the pages and I am beginning 
to suspect that her affection for 
Dr. Vestor, genuine though it may 
be, will never quite extend itself 
to include Dr. Vestor 's metier. 

He proposed to her, she told me. 
while they were passing over the 
flower Islands on their way back 
to Main Base, and it was that particular incident, I think, although 
the proposal itself was unquestionably a true manifestation of his suppressed desire, thai activated the 
concatenation of ratiocination that 
led ultimately to his analysis of the 
culture, and, of course, to his immediate return to the southern land 
mass for Dr. ILwley and myself. 

The wedding, incidentally, will 
be a double one, and is scheduled 
to take place as soon as the demolition crew returns. Bruce calls it the 
"flower Island Wedding' and say\ 
that I am his "flower Island 
Bride." He's always saying quaint 
things like that. 

Shortly, we shall be leaving Vowalbaut 4 for Terra. I shall be relieved in a way, I realize that such 
an emotion is atypical of me, but 
the nordic culture here has begun 
to pall on me. It too has turned out 
to be matrilmeal. 

Tor some reason, I am rather 
sick of matrilineal cultures . . . 



final

by... Sam Mertuin Jr. 



They had prepared a sturdy bomb 
shelter to protect the Great Man 
from the Flying Saucers. But he 
had to see them with, his own eyes. 



They tried to make the Great 
Man go down into the lead-andgraphite-sheathed bomb shelter deep 
under the outwardly modest Mid- 1 
western house that was his "secret" 
summer residence. His aides, his 
secretary, the civilian-clothed bodyguards — all of them were insistent. 

"You're much too valuable, 
sir" 

"It's our sworn duty to protect' 
you, sir" . . . 

"We don't know what they are, 
sir . . ." 

The Great Man knew he was 
breaking the hearts of his official 
family by disobeying. But curiosity 
was one of the traits that had 
helped him to the top, and he had 
heard too much about "them" — although he had yet to see one of the 
alien visitors. He looked at his 
wife, and read in her serene g;ize 
that she understood and approved. 
He said, to his chief aide: "If 
they've found us here, there's not 
much sense in hiding, is there?" 

And, when no definite reply was 
forthcoming, he asked, "What i& 
your theory as to their nature — and 
just how many of them are there?" 

"Denver reports half a dozen

headed Hirectly this way at an estimated two thousand miles pec 
hour," said the Air Force aide, his 
handsome face a rigid mask of disapprovals "That was five minutes 
ago." 

"And their nature?" the Great 
Man repeated quietly. 

It was the Air Defense aide who 
answered him. "We don't know, sir. 
They look simply like rather large, 
moving lights in the sky. But, as 
always, radar has picked up solid 
bodies," 

"Thank you." The Great Man 
glanced at the banjo clock on the 
flower-papered wall. "They should 
be here any minute then," he said. 
"Gentlemen, I ask you to leave us 
alone. I have no wish to command 
you." 

Obviously, this unorthodox request put an alarming spoke in the 
closely-meshed wheels of the armed 
defense plans. Sensing the uncertainty and dismay of everyone in 
the room, the Great Man said, "I 
wish you to observe, and report — 
but on no account are you to inaugurate hostile action. Is that clear?" 
"But what if they attack first?" 
' The Air Force aide inquired anxiously. 

"I said you were not to Tnaugurrfte hostile action," was the Great 
Man's quiet reply. "If they actually 
attack — and I doubt that they will 
from the past records — you are free 
to take whatever defensive measures 
you may consider necessary," 

They left the room reluctantly, 
unhappily. Thq Great Man smiled 



at his wife. "Darling," he said, 
"let s go to the balcony. If those 
well-meaning friends of ours think 
they're going to stop me from seeing my first flying saucers they're 
tragically mistaken." 

"Of course, dear," his wife replied. 

She already had her knitting 
neatly stowed away in the needlepoint bag in which she customarily 
carried it. Now she removed her 
glasses and put them in their case, 
and rose quickly to her feet, still 
a trim, attractive figure of a woman 
despite her fifty years. 

As they walked toward the balcony, the Great Man wondered 
what he could have accomplished 
without her. Certainly, the nine 
years since their marriage had been 
his happiest — each a glowing milestone in his swift climb to political 
eminence. 

They stood side by side on the 
broad balcony, which was really the 
verandah roof, and looked , out at 
the star-swept skies. Roughly gauging the direction with his eyes, the 
Great Man said, "If the reports are 
accurate, they should be coming 
from there," He pointed toward the 
low flat sweep of the southwestern 
horizon. 

"Darling! Look over there!" 
There was controlled excitement 
in his wife's soft voice. 

He followed her gaze a bit further north, and immediately saw 
them — one, two, three, and then 
three more — as they came sweeping 
earthward at an incredible speed. 




FINAL 

They looked like immense balls 
of Hght, slightly fuzzy around the 
edges, leaving faint trails of white 
lire in their wake. 

They were terrifyingly near — 
and they moved into silence. The 
Great Man knew that all around the 
house, in a complex involving many 
square miles, alert defenders were 
stationed — some at radar panels and 
others around electronic anti-aircraft cannon and Nike launchers, 
(heir weapons primed with atomic 
warheads. Yet the night was silent. 

A cricket chirped somewhere, but 
its song was quickly drowned in the 
faint unmistakable whine of a distant jet engine. The Air Force was 
on sky reconnaissance. The Great 
Man uttered a silent prayer that 
they would confine themselves to 
observation. There was another 
whine, and then another and another, each growing louder against 
the stars as the mysterious invaders 
swept rapidly closer. 

Although flying saucer stories had 
appeared in the press in waves, with 
long intervals between reports, in 
official circles that activity had not 
died down since their fust sigh;ing 
by Kenneth Arnold in 1947, Of 
late, more and more such activity 
had been reported. They had bees 
seen over the big cities, as well as 
above more isolated regions. Unmistakably, it was a pattern of approaching climax. 

Over Europe, Africa, South 
America and behind the Iron Curtain as well as over North America, 
the Unidentified Flying Objects had 



EXAM 63 

been observed and had given buth 
to the wildest speculations. 

A disturbed Moscow had labeled 
them horror weapons of the imperialistic powers. And certain 
American journals had insisted they 
were super-Soviet aircraft that foreshadowed another and greater Pearl 
Harbor, 

But until now the Great Man had 
never seen one of them — had even 
disbelieved in their existence. Me 
watched them swoop closer, ever 
closer, and his left arm sought the 
reassuring solace of his wife's waist. 

"What are they?" he wondered 
aloud. "Where do they come from? 
What do they u\tnt?'' 

Suddenly the leading invader 
dropped with incredible swiftness, 
until it seemed to be hovering directly above them. A quartet of 
searchlight beams stabbed out and, 
for an instant, held it in a crossflare of light. 

The Great Man gasped. It was 
solid, and its billowing contours 
hinted at a complex simplicity that 
was, the Great Man sensed instinctively, beyond the inventive capacity 
of human technology at its most ingenious. 

Then, as suddenly as it had appeared, it was gone — and with it 
went the other lights. The Great 
Man realized he was gripping his 
wife far too tightly, and released 
her. He laughed, a bit shakily, and 
said, "Well, anyway, I've seen one 
of them dose up."' 

"What do you think it was?" his 



64 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSH 



wife asked quietly as they went back 
indoors. 

He shook his head. "I'm damned 
if I know," he told her. "Darling, 
I think I'd better talk to Harlan. 
He may have an idea. Do you 

mind?" 

"Of course not," she replied 
warmly. "Give him my love. And 
let me know what he thinks they 
ace." 

Harlan was not an official. A 
philosopher, a teacher, a writer, a 
brilliant theoretical astrophysicist, 
he was the Great Man's closest 
friend and most trusted advisor. 
Independently wealthy, he had stubbornly refused to take any salaried 
post. "This way," he had told the 
Great Man more titan once, "I'm 
still my own master and can offer 
OCcasioail suggestions that you 
won't have to frown upon oflicially." 

He had taken a house less than 
a mile from the Great Man's inland 
residence. He did not seem to care 
;i[ :ill that it was a comfortable, 

hideously ugly relic of the "big 
house" period that extended roughly from 1880 to 1910. It took the 
Great Man less than five minutes 
to reach it. 

As always on seeing him again 
after a month's absence the Great 
Man wis startled by his advisor's 
outward youth fulness. Save for the 
grey that peppered his dose-cropped 
hair, and the tiny crow's-feet about 
his eyes, Harlan might have been a 
remarkably precocious, quite recent 
university graduate. 



More shaken than he cared to 
admit, the Great Man asked, "Did 
you see it, Harlan?" 

"I saw," said Harlan softly. Like 
the Great Man's wife, the famed 
astrophysicist seemed built around 
an inner serenity that enabled him 
to meet each of life's crises, firmly, 
rationally, and without foolish or 
fearful deviation. 

"What do you think?" the Great 
Man asked him. 

For a moment Harlan regarded 
his guest calmly from around the 
bowl of his pipe. Finally he said, 
"What should I think? It occurs to 
me that what you think is vastly 
more important." 

The Great Man had risen and 
was pacing the floor. "Harlan," he 
said. "I'm beginning to think the 
military is right. I'm beginning to 
believe (hat these UFO's are of ;ilien 
origin, From the steadily increasing 
and consistent pattern of their appearances, I can only conclude that 
they are the prelude to some sort of 
invasion from space." 

"Who'd want this little planet?** 
Harlan asked, with ironic bitterness. 
"It is already despoiled, overpopulated ..." 

"Not knowing the nature of our 
visitors," said the Great Man, "and 
not knowing their needs or desires, 
how can wc answer such a question?" He paused, regarding his 
host steadily for an instant. Then he 
said: "You'll be glad to know I 
refused to permit hostile action, a 
stand which you yourself strongly 
urged mc to take." 



"Thank you," said Harlan, simply and sincerely. 

Something in his lone stopped 
the Great Man in his tracks. 
"Thank you," he said. "Why 
thank me? Harlan. Why are you 
staring at me like that?" 

Harlan held his gaze, and nodded 
slowly. "It's true," he said. "I'm 
one of them. We have techniques — 
hypnotics and the like — to make the 
records misleading. Don't look so 
horrified, my friend. Although I am 
not of Earth, I'm human enough." 

The Great Man sank into a chair, 
still staring in stunned horror at his 
advisor. ' But Harlan," he said, 
"why have you done this to vie? 
Where are you from? What do you 
and your people want?" He felt a 
sick diziincsi at the base of his 
brain, such is he had not felt since 
(he last election had hung precariously in the balance. 

"You have asked me three questions," was the reply, "and none of 
them simple." A faint smile tugged 
at his lips. "However, I'll try to answer them lo the best of my ability. 
Why have I done this lo you? I 
scarcely believe, if you'll think back 
over the past few years, that I have 
done anything to you. 

"The advice I gave you was sincerely given and it was in the best 
interests of your country, and your 
world. I may as well tell you I became your advisor because I was 
assigned to the task on my own 
world." , 

The Great Man could only keep 
staring at Harlan, wondering what 



65 

his real name was, and whether he 
was seeing him as a human being 
only because Harlan had planned it 
that way. 

Harlan went on quickly: "As to 
where we are from, I can only say 
the inhabited Galaxy. You see, there 
are hundreds of far-flung planets 
suitable for human life scattered 
among the stars of what you call 
the Milky Way." 

"And precisely what do you 
want? Why are you invading Earth 
at this time?" the Great Man mked] 
in a faraway voice. 

"All we want," was the quiet 
reply, "is to see the people of your 
world become sufficiently mature to 
join the rest of us — without repeating some of the ghastly mistakes 
that certain olher strong, primitive 
planetary societies have made. That 
is why I— and many others — have 
been given the assignment of trying 
to prepare you for your most difficult (ask — the early control of 
atomics. 

"You speak of 'invasion.' What 
you arc wilnessing is actually quite 
the reverse. We have done al! we 
can on Earih. The rest is up to you. 
The vessels which you call flying 
saucers are actually here to take us 
home." 

The Great Man was on his feet 
again, somehow more alarmed by 
Harlan's last statement than by his 
previous fears. "But you're leaving 
us in a terrifying mess," he said. 
"Why can't you keep ou helping us 
a little longer. Why can't you?" 

Harlan slowly shook his head. 



66 FANTASTIC 

"We have guided you as far as we 
can," he replied. "We cannot teach 
you to master yourselves. We have 
managed to bring you, without self 
destruction, to the final test. It will 
cither take you to the stars or leave 
your planet a briefly glowing cinder 
in the skies. But we cannot take the 
examination for you." 

"L sec." The Great Man was 
humble beyond his habit. He was 
just beginning to realize how completely he had depended on Harlan 
to make his decisions for him. 
Without him . . . and without his 
wife ... he would be like a small 
boy trying to run a business. A defiant spark flamed within him. 

"I could give orders to have you 
confined — to keep you here," he 
said. 

But Harlan shook his head. "You 
couldn't. I want you to leave me 
now. It will be easier that way. 
This is goodbye, my friend, unless 
fate wills us to meet out there." He 
nodded toward the windows and 
the glowing night sky beyond. 

There was something in his manner which forbade disbelief. The 
Great Man shook his hand and, unexpectedly, there were tears in his 
eyes. NUtt an put a sympathetic hand 
on his shoulder and said, "That IS 
what will bring you through. You 
can love." 

"Yes," said the Great Man. "We 
can love. I only hope it is enough." 

"It will have to be," said Harlan, 
"for you have very little else." And 
there was something — a warning, 
perhaps — in his tone which echoed 



UNIVERSE 

in the Great Man's ears long after 
he was back in the big car en route 
to ins own house. 

The taut excitement of a half 
hour earlier had vanished. His aides 
and bodyguards were casual, and relaxed, as if nothing out of the ordinary had happened. Wondering, 
more than a little frightened, the 
Great Man went upstairs to the 
apartment he occupied with his 
wife. He called to her but she did 
not answer. He searched for her but 
she was not there. 

All at once, he knew. She, too, 
was one of them— the serene, wonderful woman who had, in a few 
short years, guided him from obscurity to the pinnacle, and whose 
cjuict poise and steadfastness had 
brought him triumphantly through 
so much. When he looked in her 
closet, he was somehow not surprised to discover that his own 
things— his golf clubs and fishing 
gear— had replaced her removed 
garments. 

He wandered out on the balcony. 
Ail at once a light flashed down out 
of the sky and hovered low, no 
more than a half mile away, over 
what had been Harlan's house. It 
hovered for an instant and then, 
suddenly, it was gone — and the 
Great Man felt alone as never before in his life. What had Harlan 
said— about love being enough? "It 
will have to be, for you have very 
little else." 

The Great Man looked up at 
Orion, and the Big Dipper, and at 
Jupiter lurking low on the horizon. 



FINAL 

Somehow, he knew, mankind had 
passed a lot of tests, with a great 
deal of travail — and the big one 
still lay still ahead. He wondered 
about his opposite numbers around 
the Earth. Had they, too, had advisors from the stars ? 

That, he decided, was one intangible he was going to have to 
take for granted. As he went back

inside, he was formulating plans to 
bling them all together, to get them 
over the last hurdle safely. And for 
the first time he had the feeling 
that, elsewhere in the world, sad but 
still- important great men and women were sharing his thoughts and 
emotions. 

It wasn't a bad thing to know. 
Not a bad tiling at alL.

device 
for 

decadence 

by . . * Ethel G. Lewis 

It seemed to Izak that he stood 
alone m a world where even the 
laughter of children was silenced. 
But with him walked— a multitude. 



That morning, before they 
rose to wash and dress for the day, 
he put his face against the back of 
his wife's neck and waited with 
pounding heart. But Katri uttered 
no more than a fluttering sigh, and 
so he, too, kept silent. Getting out 
of bed, the scent of Katri's hair 
still more binding than thought or 
fear or spoken word, be went to 
the dresser to pick up the Directional which would go into his 
pocket when he was clothed. 

The tape snapped into his hand 
and automatically he read the 
words by which each male in that 
year of 2005 daily guided his behavior: 

Guard yourself against 
spurious manifestations 
and pleasantries. Friendliness' leads to decadence. 
The foundation of our 
civilization is" duty well 
performed. 

It seemed to Izak as the words 
faded and the tape settled back into 
its holder, that the confines of his

body stretched with a flooding 
surge of doubt. It took at least 
thirty seconds for him to force his 
mind back to the normalcy of acceptance. Standing with head 
bowed, he listened to the soft 
sounds nude by Katri's felt slippers. And presently, when they 
were seated for their breakfast of 
Elixir and Biscuit Vits, their eyes 
met in a hasty, guilt-heavy remembrance of his caress. 

It was only during the past year 
that it had become so difficult for 
him to think of Katri as simply 
the woman who kept his home 
clean, called at the various Stations 
for most of the household supplies, served him his nourishment 
and provided him with a means 
for reproduction. 

He and Katri had become a Unit 
six years ago, and if for most of 
those years, he was free of doubt, 
calm and efficient with duty clearly 
his motivation, what specifically 
had happened to change him? Had 
it been his meeting with Ebon 
Bolder and Given Bare? 

Even as he thought the two 
names, his eyes went cold and his 
ears cocked for the tune of the 
Directional clicking in his pocket. 
He rose from the table without 
draining his glass of Elixir, averted his eyes from Katri's silent question and hastily left the house to 
walk with firm step toward die 
store where it was his job to dispense the oil cans used for keeping 
Directionals in good order. While 
the women did not wear pocket 



DECADENCE 69 

Directionals, they called regularly 
for the oil cans at Izak's Station 
and at others spotted through the 
district. 

At the age of eighteen, the same 
year Katri had been brought to 
him so that the Humbert Unit 
would be formed, he had been designated a Dispenser and from that 
time to this he had been in sole 
charge of die Station. Approaching the door as it swung wide to 
allow him to enter, he found his 
thoughts jangled once again and 
heard with a prick of fear the 
slightly discordant clicking in his 
pocket. 

Once more he laboriously 
emptied his thoughts, but one persisted, a memory which would not 
sink back with the odiets. And it 
was of Katri. 

One afternoon a month was set 
aside for paired people to walk in 
the area where a canopy kept off 
the sunlight and provided a cool 
place to sit or walk. Was it, he 
pondered, two or three years ago 
that diis had taken place? He recalled that a group of Young with 
their woman Guardian had been 
in the area for a Free Period. 

Suddenly a small boy with a 
head of thick golden curls had 
broken from the group, his face 
distorted with terror, and gleaming 
with tears. "I lost it, oh, my Directional, I lost it . . . oh, oh, High 
Office, do not strike me down! I 
shall find it, I shall search until I 
find it . , ," And then with a 
scream he had begun to run. 



JO FANTASTIC 

The Guardian had lifted her 
white sleeved arm in an attempt to 
hold the boy but he had slipped 
away. She had called once in a high 
abrupt voice, but the sobbing lad 
h.id seemed not to hear. Quiet had 
fallen on the area again, broken 
only by the low murmur of the 
Young as they sat in a half moon 
around the Guardian. 

Moving on, Izak felt Katri's 
hand creep into his. 

"At what age/' she said in her 
sweet voice, "does a boy begin to 
Wear a pbefcet Directional, Izak?" 

"At the age of four," he told 
her. 

The unprecedented act of Katri's 
hand slipping into his had disturbed him. His fear that his impulses 
would record in the Granite Room 
of the High Office began to throb 
in his; temples. Actually it was not 
kiiown whether the antenna in the 
atmosphere was infallible and all 
inclusive. Izak knew only that he 
hoped it was not . . . that Katri's 
touch and Katri's next words would 
not change his metabolism to a 
degree high enough to be caught 
by the overhead antenna. 

"Izak" — her voice was a whisper— "I wisli no Young. We have 
been together three years and before I wished for Young. Now I 
do not. The Young are tormented 
beyond endurance— by fear, by terror. I am yours, and upon the days 
designated I shall not resist. But I 
want no Young." 

He could make no answer for 
he knew that the Young suffered 



UNIVERSE 

many terrors. The loss of one's Directional twice, or injury to it, 
could result in even a child being 
summoned, and those who had been 
summoned seldom returned. These 
were placed in the category known 
as the Inadequate.*. Words, he 
thought. The growing up years 
were flooded with the words of 
the Guardian of Education. An endless stream of words repeated hour 
upon hour, until at the end of the 
day tiie Young were able to give 
quick, complete answers out of the 
brimming well of memory. 

His rating had been high enough 
to accredit him for the Specialized 
Lectures. A mere handful out of 
his group had been chosen to learn 
the operation of planobiles. Half 
were on the Regular list and half 
on the Substitute List where his 
name was placed. 

But that day he could not speak 
freely to Katri. and it seemed to him 
then that his life was replete with 
more silences than the air with antenna. 

Arrived at his Station, he made 
his preparations for servicing the 
community with the shining oil 
cans. He dusted and he polished, 
and concurrently his thoughts ran 
fluid ... for Katri was very much 
in his mind and fear for Katri had 
begun to haunt his waking hours. 
Was it recorded in the Gran ite 
Room that the Humbert Unit had 
produced no Young? It could not 
be otherwise. Ah, if Katri were 
taken from him I 

Steady now, Humbert, he said 



DEVICE FOR 

aloud. His own defection lay in the 
Continuation Pills. It was three 
years now since he had been ordered to report to Ebon Bolder's 
Station for the Pills. Those males 
who produced reasonably soon after 
union, were not on order to report 
for the Pills. Only those, like Leak, 
who did not augment the population. They alone made the weekly 
visit, and slowly there rose in him 
as he worked a strange sense of 
gratitude that he was on order to 
obtain the Pills. 

In this way he had met Ebon 
Bolder. A squarely built man with 
dark eyes which looked directly 
into his, Ebon sent forth an aura 
of strength. He did not speak and 
there -was no waste motion in what 
he did. But his eyes were direct, 
,uul more than once Izak had felt 
that Ebon wanted to smile. 

A small sound of derision now 
broke from his lips. GUARD 
YOURSELF AGAINST SPURIOUS MANIFESTATIONS AND 
PLEASANTRIES. Smiling was in 
this category. The whole community went alxxit with stern faces. 
Had he ever heard anyone laugh? 
Only Given Bare. Once . . . that 
day in the held. Given Bare. The 
name was good in his mind and 
on his tongue. He felt himself 
swell to greater proportions on 
merely thinking the name. Given 
was the only man who had ever 
uitcred the word Book. Book. Freedom. 

That had beta later, not on the 
fnrst occasion of their meeting. 



DECADENCE 7 I 

"This is Given Bare," Ebon Bolder 
had said when first they had met 
in his Station. "Given, this is Izak 
Humbert." And then there had been 
silence and the look exchanged between Given and Ebon was such 
as l2ak had never before seen between two men. 

He had had the thought fleetingly that with two such men for 
his friends he need never again be 
lonely. And when Given drew back 
his hand with the packet of Continuation Pills in it, placed there 
by Ebon, he had turned to give 
Izak the same strong look and Izak 
had guessed the truth, He had 1 
known that Given did not swallow 
the pills, that either Given or his 
wife, or both, preferred not to 
bring Young into existence . . . 

Behind him he heard the soft, 
blurred footsteps of a woman's 
slippers, and he turned. Just in 
time, he checked the upturning of 
his lips. More and more he had 
to be rigidly watchful. This was 
Gofrey Impak's wife and she came 
now to his counter to extend fur 
hand. No greetings were exchanged 
while Izck took a polished can from 
a shelf and placed it into her palm. 
The woman inclined her head and 
went out. 

Izak took the Ledger from ils 
drawer and made a cheek mark on 
the page bearing the Impak name. 
It^ was vital to keep the records 
straight, for in this way the High 
Office was able to gather the data 
which enabled it to keep its finger 
in the pulse of dutifulness. 



72 FANTASTIC 

A faint scent lingered in the Station after the departure of Gofrey 
Impak's woman. The scent 
brought Katri fulL to his mind, 
and he thought of Katri placing 
Upon their table the flowers forbidden. A Scotching Crew was on 
duty sixteen hours a day to see to 
it that no seed was planted and 
that no flowers grew. 

Once, it was whispered, a man 
had planted a few seeds in the 
sparse precious grains of earth he 
had scratched up from beneath one 
of the cement walks. The man had 
disappeared soon after, and for a 
week there was Conduct Lectures 
each night attended by both men 
and women. Over and over the 
Guardian's voice repeated, "Beware 
the flower for it speaks of softness 
and softness leads to decadence." 

Yet, Katri had known no fear. 
Thinking this, his heart seemed to 
stir and move in its place as if seeking more room. He remembered 
the night he had returned from his 
Station. Upon the table was a small 
dish and in it reposed three tiny 
blue flowers. 

* "Katri," he had said hoarsely. 
"The flowers." 

Her wide gray eyes had not evaded him. Very sweetly her lips had 
curved. "Yes, Izak," she said, "the 
flowers." 

"When you saw them, you 
should have torn them out by the 
roots," he said, forcing harshness 
into his voice. 

"I know," Katri said softly. 
"Flowers are devices for deca


UNIVERSE 

dence." Speaking the words of the 
Conduct Lectures, Katri seemed not 
to believe in them. "I saw them 
on my way to the Nourishment Station. They were growing at the far 
edge of one of the cement walks. 
I think they must have sprung up 
overnight, they're so frail and delicate. I did not pick them at once. 
But on my way back, I caught their 
scent. I had to have them before 
the Scotching Crew arrived." 

Katri paused and there was a 
quickening of her voice when she 
went on. "The flowers brought 
something to my mind, something 
from very long ago. Something 
which my mother might have 
known . . ." 

Speaking of one's parents was 
frowned upon. Izak had disciplined 
himself to turn a harsher voice upon 
his Katri. "You must destroy them 
at once," he told her. 

"Here, Izak!" Katri had moved 
swiftly toward the table. She cupped the tiny flowers in both her 
hands and came toward him. "1 
wanted you to see them. Now you 
must smell them and then of course 
I will crush them." 

She lifted her hands toward him 
and he went close to her and bent 
his head and for one instant he was 
lost as the fragile scent of the flowers came fully against hts face. 
"Now . . ." whispered Katri. 
She took a few steps back from 
him. His head still whirling, he 
watched as she lifted her hands 
breast high and then pressed them 
tightly together until the room was 



DEVICE FOR DECADENCE 



73 



heady with the scent of the crushed 
flowers. After a moment, Katri 
turned and went to the brass container on its pedestal in one corner 
of the room. Here the perpetual 
flame burned for various uses, and 
into this cuplike shape Katri let 
the pitiful remnants drop as she 
slowly opened her hands. 

The door swung open once more 
to permit a woman to enter, She 
was a slight fair person quick of 
gait and stern of face. She wore 
the traditional slim frock and the 
close head-covering which women 
were permitted to discard in very 
warm weather. On receiving the oil 
can in her hand, she lifted her eyes 
to hiin. A smile, he thought, a 
smile lies in her eyes. 

"I am Given Bare's wife," she 
said in a low clear voice. "We 
have been moved to this community." 

He nodded, turned die pages of 
the Ledger and wrote the name 
clearly across the top of a blank 
sheet. Then he made a large check 
against the date, and then almost 
without a vestige of dread, he let 
bis mouth loosen into the forbidden smile and he said quietly, 
"Welcome/ 1 

"The Circle widens," she said 
and then she departed swiftly. 

The arrival of another woman 
at once helped him hold' firmly to 
his demeanor of severity. There 
were many betrayals among the 
people, and one never knew whose 
eyes were keen enough to discern 
the last faint trace of a smile. This 



woman was one he knew well. She 
was Orton Beak's woman, and now 
she extended a heavy, work worn 
hand. 

She had drab gray hair but her 
eyes were fine, a lustrous, startling 
blue. She accepted the oil can and 
moved back the way she had come. 
He made the check on the Beak's 
page, and lifted his head to see 
with eyes refusing to believe that 
Orton Beak's woman was looking 
back and in that imperceptible moment before she stepped outside, 
one corner of her mouth lifted 
and a light danced in her eyes. 

The next day, at sunrise he was 
requisitioned by direct contact on 
their ceiling panel, to pilot the 
quatro-motored planobile to the 
farm where grain was grown for 
the manufacture of Biscuit Vits. 
Here too the factory stood where 
the food was beaten and formed 
into the wafers, which were then 
boxed and tied into bales for dispersal. Another member of the 
male sector would take over his 
Station for the day, while he flew 
the planobile. 

There were no more than a 
dozen who had this mechanical 
skill, and as he rose I t orn the 
ground, his hands knowing and at 
ease upon the controls of the machine, he pondered on what had 
happened to Orton Beak who had 
held this post for many years. He 
almost panicked as thoughts rioted 
through his mind. Betrayal. Had 
Orton fallen prey to some device 
for decadence and been sum

moncd? There was no way of find* 
tng out. Those who disappeared 
were never seen again. 

As he neared the farm and sighted the tall grain waving in the mild 
breeze, his heart rose even as he 
set down the planobilc. He was 
going to see Given Bare once more. 
He would stand close to this huge 
man from whom strength emanated in waves. He would again be 
forced, and so willingly, to look up 
into the warm, dark eyes of this 
man who was six feet six and whose 
thick hair was like a gay banner. 

Given came striding toward him 
as he emerged from his seat, and 
he saw that he came with hand 
outstretched. Almost Izak ran. A 
gasp escaped him when at last they 
were close, their fingers linked, 
their eyes locked fast. Still maintaining the close contact, Given 
turned his head briefly, blew a 
whisde and then waved as a line 
of men carrying bales began to 
come from the Storage Room. Activity centered about the planobile 
some twenty yards off, and Izak's 
sense of safe isolation with Given 
grew deeper. 

He had learned much from 
Given, much to give a man hope 
but he had not yet learned how 
to cast out fear. For one cowardly 
instant he wished that Given would 
not speak. But the quaking wi;hin 
him faded and ended as the eyes 
of Given Bare returned to fix him 
searchingly. The firm lips gentled 
into a smile and the grip of Given's 
fingers tightened and Izak became 



UNIVERSE 

the sort of man Given could call 
friend. 

"We have widened our non-contact period with the High Office," 
Given said. "There arc fifteen minutes free of interception. Our own 
interception crew keeps the antenna 
clear. Each day, Izak, wc unearth 
more books from beneath the cement walks. We have learned that 
tapes were used before this era. In 
a place called [he Stock Market 
where business ' men measured the 
economics of the time. 

"Many of these were unsmiling 
men, and our government copied 
much of its policy from them. And 
now this is our knowledge, Izak. 
It cannot be taken from us. As 
we spread our knowledge, the 
Circle widens and takes iron into 
itself, the iron of resolve. Each day 
we discover more friends among 
us, although some arc still not without fear." 

"I am one of these," Izak said 
with shame. "I strive for courage 
and it fails me over and over." 

Given leaned close to him. "Do 
not despair, You are but twentyfour years old, Izak. I am thirty 
and have been intent upon forming 
[lie Circle since I was twenty. I 
have had ten years to scrabble beneath the cement for the buried 
books. You need more time, Izak, 
but you are one of us. And no man 
knows when he shall grow large 
in his spirit, and become wholly 
himself." 

"1 fear for Katri," Izak told him. 
"Yes. Your Katri is one of us." 



DEV1CB FOR 

Gi vcn's eyes were half closed in 
the strong sunlight. "Katri brought 
you the three blue flowers." 

Izak's hand jerked in the strong 
clasp. He had not told Given of this 
incident ! 

"We intercepted that episode of 
the flowers," Given informed him 
gravely. "Our crew on Interception 
has grown skilled in the last several mon ths as more and more 
books arc found. There is no record in the Granite Room of High 
Office, Izak." Given hesitated and 
then spoke once more. "But Katri's 
name is on the maximum list as far 
as Reproduction. Seven years are 
usually allowed, yet for some reason her name has already been 
recorded. Our people — we have six 
stationed in key positions now — 
are watching, Izak. We know th.it 
you have constantly fought deep 
feeling for your wife." 

Miraculously now he was filled 
with a surging of resolve. It coursed 
in his blood. When thoughts of 
Katri came to him, he was whole. 
He was as tall as Given and as 
strong. 

"I love her," he said and had 
no way of knowing how the word 
had come to him. 

Given's face seemed lighted. 
"You have caught the word from 
our messages. That is our newest 
development. We can now send 
isolated words like love and trust 
and hope out into the a'tmosphere. 
Our radar underground is rapidly 
digesting what we hnd in the books 
and then spreading it." 



DECADENCE 75 

Now Given's face sobered and 
he stepped free of Izak. "We have 
managed to place three in the High 
Office," he said. "Our people. That 
means strength in the Core of Today's Regime, Izak. Our people in 
the very Core of the government. 
Now listen. We seek not perfection, Izak, so our goal is possible. 
We have learned. Each time we 
find another book, we learn. A century ago people were free, but 
often they were indifferent. 

"They were ashamed but they 
stayed indifferent to the suffering 
of others. Of some we learn twisted, puzzling facts. A world stood 
aside and did nothing while genocide was practiced by one nation 
upon anodicr. But individuals 
cared, and many sacrificed themselves. There have been no books 
in the last forty years because the 
government wished us to know 
only what we were taught by word 
of mouth through our Guardians. 
But now wc know what transpired 
in the era before ours. Now, we 
are armed!" 

Given's face went stern and 
without another word he left flat. 
Their time had run out, Izak 
realized. The precious fifteen minutes had been used up. 

After reporting to the Receiving Center with his cargo, Izak 
made his way homeward, thinking 
of Katri, Might it be a man's portion in life, he pondered, to love 
his wife not by rote on the days 
designated on the tape, but rather 
from a mutual quickening between 



76 FANTASTIC 

husband and wife? Katri did not 
come forward as he entered the 
house, and he stopped short in the 
hall witli a sudden burst of panic. 
And in the pause the clicking in 
his pocket grew louder, more insistent. Drawing out the tape, he 
stood stoned by shock. He read: 

Izak Humbert: 

Your volition grows, your control weakens. Your name has been 
moved into the intensified watch 
department. Your wife, Katri, bos 
been taken under advisement. 

The last sentence pounded in his 
head. Katri ! He began to run 
through the rooms, calling her 
name. But there was silence. There 
was no whisper of her presence 
until the very silence became like 
thunder: in his ears. They had taken 
Katri, had put their hands upon 
her! 

Given Dare, he thought. Rushing 
from the house, the name of this 
man alone kept him sane. He knew 
that, walking, it would take him 
half an hour to teach the farm. 
Without hesitation or doubt he 
flung his Directional against a massive stone wall as he passed and 
felt his heart leap as the tape holder shattered into small pieces. "No 
man knows when he shall grow 
large in his spirit, and become 
wholly himself." Given had spoken 
those words to him barely an hour 
before. And now for him, Izak 
Humbert, the coward's panic was 
gone forever. 



UNIVERSB 

All about him on the streets were 
people returning from their various 
stations, and after a time he saw 
that many eyes were turned upon 
him scarchingly. He saw a man 
smile and then another whispered 
to him, "Friend." There was a 
great rhythm in his brain and i 
great sense of his own resolve. They 
shall not take Katri from me! 

Another man hailed and looked 
intently at him and then smiled 
and turned to walk along with him. 
And another . . . "Friend," was 
whispered now on either side of 
him. He knew that behind him 
walked many men and women. 
Each man joining us puts iron into 
our Circle, he thought, remembering other words of Given Bare. 

He held out his hand and touched a man's shoulde. and the man's 
eyes were lighted. Another man 
and another woman reversed their 
steps to join him. One by one they 
came, and then in pairs. He had 
only to look into a face to see that 
its smile and its shining eyes were 
but a reflection of his own. 

"Friends," he said firmly and he 
knew the sound of his voice was 
strong. 

"Friends," they murmured in 
chorus. The sound of their footsteps became a common sound, one 
that linked brothers bent upon the 
same purpose. 

When Izak reached the gates of 
Given Bare's Farm Station, and 
they swung wide to permit passage, 
he did not enter alone but as one 
of a great, surging throng.

Joan knew nothing of Dr. Rhine's 
famed Duke University experiments 
in telepathy. She was just herself 
—in the future's bright unfolding. 



\yiTH thoughtful deliberation 
D:. Jflflies Ballantine, psychiatrist, 
stepped from the elevator house cn 
to the rooftop of the Arthur Buck' 
Icy Plant Development Institute. He 
crossed the small trelliscd enclosure, 
released the bead-high catch on the 
gate, and opened it gently. 

Tiny pink fingers hooked around 
the gate, low down, and tugged it 
wide open. A lemon -f rocked and 
bonneted baby girl flung herself at 
his knees. He picked her up and 
submitted gladly to a throttling embrace and a long, moist kiss on his 
check. 

"Hello, sweetheart !" he said 
when he had her sitting upright on 
his arm, accompanying the greeting 
with a smile. "Let me look at you. 
Are you well, Joan?" 

She nodded vigorously, bet 
velvet-brown, almost black, eyes 
dancing, 

"H-ll-w -nele B-ll-nt-ne," she replied in a husky, vowel-less whisper, 
slowly but with clear, painstaking 
lip movements. Thus well, by sedulous training, had her mother, 
taught her to speak despite her laik 
of vocal cords.

into the garden, carefully closing 
the gate. Juit before they reached 
the front door of the penthouse the 
child wriggled to be put down. She 
took him by the hand and led him 
into the hall where her tall, auburnhaired mother, widow of the founder of the Institute, and now its Director, awaited them. 

The child hurried into the lounge. 
When Dr. Ballantine and her mother followed her she was seated at 
her small nursery table, with het 
bonnet off, and her frosty, albinoid 
hair gleaming. She seemed "Imost 
doll-like as she sat there waiting, 
her parted lips eager with anticipation. 

"No time yetjor adult conversation, Jim," said Dr. Elizabeth Buckley, smiling. "That table was 
brought in here early tins morning, 
and the cards set out. She knew, 
without my telling her, that you 
were coming today." 

"The matter was in your mind 
more than once, no doubt,'" Dr. 
Ballantine said, significantly. 

Dutifully Ballantine took his seat 
jn the easy-chair across the table 
from Joan. Before him was a small 
pack of cards, face downwards. In 
front of the child was a long box 
with a hinged lid, like a case in 
which carvers are kept. With tilted 
chin and quite calmly the twentyninc-months-alil little girl awaited 
the ritual of checking. 

Under her eyes Ballantine sorted 
his cards, face upwards, into five 
groups. There were five cards with 
a large cross on each, live with a 



UNIVERSE 

circle, five with a square, five with 
a star, and five with three parallel 
wavy lines. Ballantine swept them 
together, shuffled them thoroughly, 
and laid them down. Joan stood up, 
cut them, and plated them before 
Ballantine r face downwards. 

Joan opened her case. In each of 
five compartments there were five 
cards of each symbol. She took out 
one group at a time and counted 
back the cards into their compartments. Then she raised the lid and 
fixed a brace to hold it vertically, 
shielding the cards from Ballantine's sight. 

lie took the top card from his 
pack. Over-acting his role of hiding 
it from her, he peeped at the symbol 
— a star. 

Promptly Joan took a card from 
■ her case and laid it face downward 
on the table, her eyes twinkling 
with mischief. 

Ballantine laid his card fate 
downwards. His next bore a circle. 
Joan selected another card, and, 
giggling, covered her first one with 
it. 

So they went, card by card, 
through the twenty-five in eath 
pack. As she put her last card down 
the little girl clasped her hands and 
rocked backwards and forwards, 
laughing silently. 

Her mother took die child's pack 
and turned it face upwards as Ballantine did the same with his. On 
top of his pack was a star — on 
Joan's three parallel waved lines. At 
the mock disappointment on the 



INFANT PRODIGY 



79 



adults' faces the child grinned with 
delight. 

Next, Ballantine presented a circle. Joan's pack showed a cross. 
There was more adult dismay— and 
more childish glee. And so on, right 
through both packs. Not one card 
in Joan's pack correctly matched its 
opposite in Ballantinc's. Sidly the 
adults shook their heads while the 
child rocked with laughter. 

"We'll have to try again," sighed 
Ballantine, shuffling his cards while 
Elizabeth Buckley sorted Joan's into 
her box. "Something must be 
wrong." 

Taking her cue, Joan came 
around the table and searched his 
coat pocket, producing a small 
package. 

"Of course!" Ballantine exclaimed. "That feUSt be the trouble." He held out his hand. "But 
you can't have it yet. You must get 
the cards right, first." 

She dimpled happily. .The ritual 
was being followed wonderfully to 
her liking. She returned the package to Ballantine, who put it on the 
piano stool. When he returned she 
was ready and waiting behind her 
box. 

Ballantinc's first card was a 
square. Joan slapped her card down. 
His next was a star. Her second 
went down at once. In quick time 
they followed through — this time 
without the laughter *but with 
mounting excitement. 

Joan was out of her chair and 
standing by the piano stool before 
they began to check. This time every 



pair of cards matched. Ballantine 
clapped his hands. 

"B-nn-h?" inquired the child, 
her eager hands almost on the package. "B-nn-h f-h J — n?" At his ostentatious nod she swept up the 
package and sat on the floor to open 
it. 

"Really, Jim, I think this game 
ought to be dropped," protested 
Elizabeth Buckley as she restored 
the cards to the case. "It's only an 
entirely feminine game to her now, 
to get a gift out of you every time 
you come." 

Ballantine shrugged-. "It's as good 
a game as any, Elizabeth, for as 
long as she gets fun out of it. I 
agree we don't need it now to find 
out whether she has some kind of 
extra-sensory perception. We know 
that. Now we're mainly studying 
the development of a proved tefcr 
path — keeping a case history, and 
so on, Meanwhile, Rhine's 'ESP 
cards' still tell us something." 

"Do they?" 

"Yes. They prove that she is still 
in command of her already confirmed abilities. She is not becoming 
confused by her widening ipprehension of new things as she grows 
older-— or by her own teasing of us 
when she deliberately selects the 
wrong cards. You will notice that 
she is always either a hundred percent right or a hundred percent 
wrong— and cither performance is 
equally good. In every case she has 
to know precisely what card I .in i 
holding." 

"P-nk b-nn-h!" announced Joan, 



8o 



FANTAS-BC UNIVERSE 



having unwrapped her package. She 
buld up a china rabbit, pink in 
color, for her mother to admire. She 
went to kiss Ballantine, in thanks. 
Having done so she promptly patted his other pocket. "131-h b-nn-h!" 
she whispered. "Bl-h b-nn-h!" 

Ballantine threw up his hands. 
"It's no use, Elizabeth! We can't 
expect to keep anything from her — ■ 
anything she's able to understand. 
Here am I with another little game 
in mind with a blue bunny, twin of 
the pink one, as a prize. But she 
already knows about the blue bunny 
in my pocket. And that proves she 
can play the new game, before we 
try it." 

Laughing, Elizabeth Biukley 
picked up her mutant daughter. 
"That sort of thing is happening to 
me, more and more, these days," 
she said. "Do you still wish to play 
the new game?" 

"Oh, yes," Ballantine assured her. 
"I still want it on record. And Joan 
must have hex prize." He took the 
package from his pocket and put it 
on the piano stool. 

"J — n's bl-h b-nn-h!" 'pronounced the child. 

"After- you play Uncle Ballantine's new game," said her mother, 
pulling her down. "Jim, excuse me 
while 1 start the tea." 

This time, with Joan in her usual 
place and her mother opposite in 
the easy-chair, Ballantine took a 
pencil and scribbling pad from his 
pocket and seated himself in the 
farthest corner of the room. Elaburately shielding what his pencil 



was doing, he said, challengingly: 
"Joan doesn't know what 1 am 
drawing!" 

Carefully he drew three waved 
lines. 

Joan eyed him from across the 
room. Then she grinned, picked up 
a card, and laid it face down 0:1 the 
table. On the next page Ballantine 
drew a square. Joan put her next 
card down. Ballantine drew a circle 
— then a star — a cross. Each time 
Joan put down a card. 

"Now Mummy, may we check 
them, please?" 

Without error the cards matched 
the drawings — and in correct order. 

"Joan knows how to play this 
game," Ballantine acknowledged. 
"Now 1 shall draw something else. 
Joan will find it and give it to 
Mummy." 

Returning to his corner he quickly sketched a tea-cup. Instantly 
Joan went to the traymobilc, lifted 
the linen drape over the afternoon 
tea things, took a cup and carried 
it to her mother. 

"That's right!" applauded Ballantine. 

Joan waited, her huge dark eyes 
agleam. 

He drew a narrow, trumpetshaped vase. The child trotted to 
the big plate-glass window which 
overlooked the Institute's experimental farms, six stories below, and 
took the Indian brass vise from the 
wide, low sill to her mother. 

Next Ballantine drew a small 
chair of the same design as Joan's 
nursery chair. Promptly that chair 



INFANT PRODIGY 



81 



was picked up and set before hec 

mother. 

He began to draw again, There 
was a clink as Joan took a teaspoon 
from the traymobilc, and another 
clink as she put it into the cup in 
front of Elizabeth Buckley. 

"Hey!" protested Ballantine. "I 
haven't finished drawing that!" 
Then, tongue in cheek, he sketched 
two big cars and a rabbi: face, wishing hard that lie had a blue pencil. 

"J — n's bl-h b-nn-h!" the child 
whispered, running to the pkijQ 
stool. 

Ballantine laughed. 

"It's your bunny now, Joan." 

Over afternoon tea, Ballantine 
explained. "I had intended, if Joan 
could draw well enough, to try 
?ome experiments in telepathy like 
'.hose Upton Sinclair and his wife 
made about fifty years ago — back in 
1928, I think it was. But Joan took 
time by the forelock, so 1 improvised a bit." 

"What kind of experiments ?" 
Joan's mother asked. 

"I must bring you. 'Mental 
Radio', Sinclair's own account of 
them," Dr. Ballantine said. "Briefly, 
lie would sit in a dosed room and 
draw something — say an umbrella — 
2nd nincentrate mentally on it. His 
wife would sit in another dosed 
room, concentrating on him, and 
would draw or write down 'whatever came into her mind.' They got 
some remarkable successes, many 
partial successes, and still more failures." 



"For example ?" asked Dr. Buckley. 
"Well, when he drew a sailing 
boat she wrote down 'sailboat.' 1 le 
drew three linked circles and she 
drew three linked circles. He drew 
a cone and she drew a cone. There 
were quite a number of others, 
equally accurate. But there were 
more 'partial successes,' as when he 
drew an hour-glass and she wrote 
'white sand." He drew a bat flying, 
a. id she wrote 'beetle, working its 
legs.' He drew a skull and 
ci oss- bones, and she wrote 'bug, 
with legs'. And there were many 
complete failures. I thought Joan 
would be able to do that sort of 
iking and score a high percentage." 

"I don't think she could draw 
well enough," Elizabeth Buckley 
said. 

"I suppose not," Ballantine conceded. "We might try some other 
time. But when she named the blue 
bunny in my pocket I knew what to 
do. She scored a hundred percent, 
as usual." 

"And what does it prove?" 
Joan's mother asked. 

"Little more than we knew .ilrcady. Bu; you will see that Rhine's 
'ESP cards' give Joan a restricted 
and predetermined set of only five 
symbols to think about, and they 
limit me, as 'sender,' to those same 
live symbols. By guessing, alone, 
any non-telepath can score some 
successes, as J. B. Rhine him>elf 
proved and allowed for in his work 
at Duke University. But Sinclair's 
method, where it suevteds, is a 
much more positive demonstration 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



of telepathy. He, as 'sender/ might 
select anything in the universe — onething out of millions. The person 
who 'receives' that thing, or -several 
such tilings, clearly and definitely, 
as Mrs. Sinclair did, is doing something much more significant than 
achieving a high score with 'ESP 
cards'." 

"1 sec that," Elizabeth Buckley 
poured him a second cup of tea. 
"What of the partial successes and 
the failures?" 

"I flunk they show the difference 
between Joan and the rest of us. 
There is reason to suspect that wc 
all have some slight and fleeting capacity for telepathy. Mrs. Sinclair 
and others may have had bcttcrthan-average capacity, however fragmentary, fugitive, and uncontrollable. But Joan has it like a fully developed sixth, sense. It works all 
the time, with her." 

Elizabeth Buckley frowned. "But 
don't you think she must have quite 
a few failures and only partial successes, too — even if they arc only 
Caused by her difficulty with adult 
thoughts beyond her mental capac
"1 agree," Ballantinc said, nodding. "But she never seems to miss 
on anything within her understanding." 

Joan had taken her two china 
bunnies to her nursery. Now she returned, hugging a coal-black kitten, 
which she brought right up to Ballantinc and dropped in his lap, 
"K-tt-h!" she said. "J — n's 
K-tt-h!'* 



"You will see the finding of the 
kitten in a Report Sheet, " explained 
Elizabeth Buckley a few minutes 
later, as she handed li.illantme some 
written notes. "A good item for the 
records, I think— one of our lirst 
animal contacts." 

Ballantine nodded. Me was 
watching Joan and the kitten playing "follow the leader," the kitten 
in front — around the piano, behind 
the door, under the table . . . And 
for the hundredth time he was 
speculating whether there could be 
any relationship between the albinoid skin and hair, the almost black 
irises, the lack of vocal cords, and 
the telepathic ability of the child. 
Between these seemingly random 
mutations he could sec only one 
thing in common — their origin in 
the same over-exposure to radioactivity which had caused the death 
of her father before she was born. 

"When did you get the kitten-'" 
lie asked. 

"One day last week, when I went 
to look at the new tomato mutants," 
Elizabeth Buckley replied. "I took 
Joan with me for the outing. It was 
a good opportunity) with only two 
mental contacts — Mr. Johnston who 
runs the tomato farm, and his 
wife." 

"Did they give it to her?" 

"No," Elizabeth Buckley said. 
"Joan found it. We were walking 
past some huge stacks of boxes 
which had just been delivered into 
the yard. Suddenly Joan stopped. 
She turned into a narrow alley between stacks. Then she turned 



INFANT 

In, and we lost sight of her. I 
was annoyed, and a bit scared, because those stacks aren't perfectly 
stable. I followed her, and Mr. 
Johnston came too. 

"Joan went quire a distance, turning left, right, and left again. We 
found her squatting on the ground, 
talking to the kitten, which was imprisoned inside a case at the bottom 
of a stack. It was mewing faintly, 
and putting out a tentative paw. 
Somehow it must have been brought 
in with the boxes the day before. 

"I took Joan away while Mr. 
Johnston worked the box Out to 
rescue the kitten. There were tears 
and struggles, for Joan objected to 
leaving. But Mr. Johnston wouldn't 
risk disturbing the stack while we 
were there. From the moment he 
brought it out the kitten and Joan 
have been almost inseparable. Joan 
demanded a drink for the kitten at 
once. Mrs. Johnston gave it some 
milk, and it certainly was thirsty." 

"Could she have beard the mewing, do you think?" Ballantine 
asked. 

"Impossible, I'm sure," Joan's 
mother answered. "The kitten was 
too tar away whea she started after 
it. There were two big stacks of 
boxes between them. And Mr. 
Johnston and I were talking." 

"So it seems she picks up animal 
mental impulses, too." v 

Elizabeth Buckley gently stirred 
her tea. "Apparently. I notice she 
always knows just where to find the 
kitten about the house and garden. 
She never searches for it. She goes 



FRODIOY 83 

straight to wherever it is. And as 
often as it follows her she follows 
it — under tables, under her cot, on 
all fours along the window sill 
there, around behind the sofa — anywhere!" 

"If she's getting the kitten's mental images she's probably tiyiog to 
share its pleasures," said Ballantine. 
Then he grinned. "Has she tried lo 
lap up milk with it yet?" 

' l Jim! How awful !" 

"Is it— really?" He chuckled. 
"Hygicnically it is, of course. But 
as companionship it is admirable. 
More than one child has done thai, 
and without being a telepath. 
Doesn't Joan share her food with 
the kitten — or try to?" 

"Why, yes," said Elizabeth Butkley, surprise in her voice. "1 didn't 
think of that as the same thing. But 
it is, of course, if you leave hygiene 
out of it. Do you think there is any 
harm in her sharing the kitten's 
impulses?" 

"I shouldn't think so," Ballantine said, thoughtfully. "I must consider it. Presumably an animal's 
impulses are simple, direct, and uncomplicated. Better than many human ones, no doubt. I should think 
Joan would quickly learn by experience that what the kitten anticipates 
with joy is not always such fun to 
her. Also she should find the kitten 
quite unable to enjoy some of her 
pleasures." 

"I have noticed, too," said Elizabeth Buckley, "that when she and 
the kitten are absorbed in their own 
affairs, Joan is less likely to Ukc 



84 FANTASTIC 
notice of what I am thinking. Several times I have had to use my 
voice quite loudly to get her attention." 

"That," said Ballantine, "might 
be quite important. It suggests a 
possible means of insulating herself 
from that ever -threatening mental 
babel we have always feared for 
her. Deep absorption ui sonic interest may enable her to do for herself 
some part of what you do for her 
now. I mean that special rapport she 
has with you when in your arms." 

"Let us hope so," said Elizabedi 
Buckley, rising to move the traymobile. "I won't always be— Oh no! 

Nor 

With eyes dilated and blanched 
cheeks Joan's mother was staring, 
horror-stricken, out through the 
open French windows. 

Ballantine sprang to his feet. He 
saw Joan, on her hands and knees, 
on the breast-htgh parapet which 
encircled the rooftop. A yard or so 
ahead was die kitten. They had 
climbed up a trellis which screened 
the roof garden from the laundry 
drying yard,- and made a corner 
with the parapet. Joan, now two 
yards along the wall, got to her feet. 

Together the two adults rushed to 
the French windows. Simultaneously 
each put out a hand to restrain the 
other. 

"Careful — no panic," cautioned 
Ballantine. "You go and just take 
her off into your arms. I'd better not 
try. She and I fool too much !" 

"She'll know what I'm thinking," 
worried Elizabctli Buckley, as the 



UNIVl-RSE 

child began to walk after the cat, 
"and lose her confidence." 

"She hasn't noticed us yet," countered Ballantine. "She must be absorbed in the game. Don't call her. 
Just; think — or whisper something 
irrelevant to yourself. 'Mary had a 
little lamb' — anything." 

With a nod, Elizabeth Buckley 
was already on her way, unhurried 
and! outwardly calm, her lips moving soundlessly. 

The kitten saw her coming. Now 
five; or six yards along the parapet, 
it hesitated, looked back at Joan, 
amj then jumped down amongst the 
pot^s and troughs of the garden. 
Scampering back to the trellis, it 
scrambled up again, and then disappeared along the parapet oa the 
other side. 

Half-way to Joan, Elizabeth 
Buckley despairingly watched the 
child turn on the low-cambcred sixtee;n-inch cap of the wall and follow 
th<s kitten. 

Joan darling — wait for meJ The 
thought came unbidden, her agonised eyes fixed on the child. 
"Mary had a little lamb . . ." 
But the silken, white hair blew 
in the breeze and the chubby pink 
lcjgs marched oa . . . Undisturbed. 
Jojan reached the trellis, put a 
hfcnd on it to steady herself, and 
pissed beyond it. 

At that moment Elizabeth Buckley tripped and fell headlong into 
thic garden. 

Joan! Joan! Com* back, darling! 
She neither cried out nor uttered i 
sexmd. But she could not hold back 



INFANT 

her desperate, anguished mental cry 
of despair. Joan! Come back! 

Ballantine threw caution to the 
winds and ran along the house wall 
to the trellis gate, trying to think 
up some fabulous bribe to induce 
Joan to pause — until he realized 
that she would see through any such 
trick. He never improved on that 
idea, for when he burst through the 
gate the child was not to be seen. 

Horror-stricken, he saw that the 
parapet was clear except for the 
kitten, now seated and watching 
him with wide, innocent eyes. The 
dean, wind-swept drying yard was 
empty. 

Sick at heart he rushed to the 
parapet, to hoist his head and shoulders over it. He forced himself to 
look down, dreading what he might 
see. 

"Oh my darling, my darling T 
came Elizabeth Buckley's voice 
through the trellis. "Oh God!" 

Back through the gate tore Ballantine, not knowing quite why. 
Haggard and tense, he plowed his 
way amongst tubs and pots to her 
side. | 

In a gust the breath came out of 
him, with relief at the sight of 
Elizabeth Buckley, still half-lying 
amongst the plants, scratched, torn 
and disheveled, but with her small 
daughter in her arms. 

The child's husky whisper came 
to him as, with her head on her 
mother's shoulder, she stroked her 
mother's cheek. 

'P— r M-mm-h! N-t fr-ght-n

PRODIGY 85 

fr-ght-n n-nh m-re. J-st s-re f — t.** 

Through brimming eyes Elizabeth Buckley looked over the baby's 
head at Ballantine as he raised her 
to a sitting position. She smiled 
wanly, the tears glistening on her 
cheeks. "Joan came back to help 
me, Uncle Ballantine, because I fell 
over. in my heart I cried out to 
her." 

"And you're not frightened any 
more," he confirmed. 

"J-st s-re f— t," added Joan. 

"She's right," said her mother, is 
Ballantine dried her cheeks with bis 
breast pocket handkerchief. "I have 
hurt my ankle. But I didn't notice 
it, until now." 

While Ballantine helped Elizabeth Buckley inside, Joan clung to 
her. The baby's head pressed 
against her bosom, with a cradling 
warmth that aroused all of her protective instincts and filled her with a 
strange rejoicing. But for the first 
time in her experience the mother 
felt that she was unable to fulfill 
her proper role. Several tiroes she 
tried to put the child down until 
her emotional turmoil could subside, but little Joan clung all the 
more tightly. 

"I'm afraid, Jim," Elizabeth 
Buckley said, propped up on a 
couch while Ballantine applied a 
cold compress to her ankle, "I just 
can't achieve the required cool, 
calm, and collected frame of mind 
just now. Joan's clinging to me in 
the usual manner, but I think our 
roles are reversed. I still feel terri

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ficd. She is calming me, if anything, I'm sure I'm nor helping 
her," 

Not for ten minutes more did 
Joan consent to be put down. Ballantine closed the French windows 
to keep her from the garden. 

"If this sort of thing can happen," said Elizabeth Buckley, when 
the child had gone to her room, 
"we'll have to leave the penthouse." 

"I should hope not,'" protested 
Ballantine. "If you lived on the 
ground there would be many more 
hazards for joan. She'd be exposed 
to dangerously haphazard mental 
contacts and many more animal contacts, with gates left open, traffic, 
and so on. I think this is still the 
ideal place to provide her with the 
necessary isolation — if we can keep 
her from marching along the cap 
of that wall again. If you have the 
trellis brought back from the pantpet about five feet she'd never be 
able lo climb op there a second 
time while she's too young to understand the danger." 

"Should I get rid of the kitten?" 
Elizabeth Buckley asked, her voice 
tremulous. 

"I don't know. Admittedly it led 
her into this danger — or that's what 
wc suspect. But when wc eliminate 
the means of climbing up there 
again, or anywhere else, she will be 
unable to follow the kitten into 
such danger." 

"But she's so susceptible. There 
may be other dangers. She'll be led 
into them all." 

"There are fewer hazards on this 



rooftop than anywhere else I can 
imagine," Ballantine assured her. 
"And don't forget, Elizabeth, that 
the very faculty that makes her so 
susceptible is the same faculty by 
which she is learning to share your 
awareness of what seems safe or unsafe lo you. She is much more likely 
than any other child to learn early 
to approve or disapprove of what 
her mother approves or disapproves. 
She may take telling no better than 
any other child. But she can gain an 
emotional awareness of why and 
wherefore through sharing your 
awareness." 

"I don't quite see — " 
"Well, you might still have to restrain her from, say, sharing the 
cat's milk. Suppose you do. You 
can, I think, be sure she will learn 
to reject such delights all the sooner 
because she will feci and share your 
revulsion at the same lime as you 
admonish her." 

"I hope you're right." 
"So do I," Ballantine affirmed. 
"Don't forget that the faculty that 
betrayed her into following the 
kitten also enabled her to walk in 
danger with a confidence similar to 
the kitten's. And it brought her 
back into safety in answer to your 
mental cry of anguish. Remember 
— 'in your heart' you cried out to 
her, and QOt with your voice. If only 

you — " 

He broke off as Joan, in tears, 
tame running from the nursery. 

"M-mm-h 1 — k!" she pleaded in 
her tensest whisper, and pointed 
out through the French windows,

where the kitten was again walking 
along the parapet. "K-tt-h ! G-t 
K-tt-h! K-tt-h Ml d-wn— g-t 
sm-sh !" 

Ballantine glanced once at the 
kitten, and swung round. "Hear 
that?" he demanded, his eyes shining. "She has already learned — " 

"From my fear," agreed Eliza


prodicy 87 

beth Buckley, the strained look of 
the past quarter-hour leaving her 
face at once. Then in another tone 
of voice, appropriately urgent, yet 
cheerful, she asked: 

"Uncle Ballantine, will you please 
take Kitty off the wall? Joan and I 
are frightened she'll fall right down 
to the ground — and get smashed!'*

by Leonard Lockhard 



Kroine was Mr. Patent Office in 
person — and a hard man to needle. 
But Marchare's underground diving 
suit had a very sharp point to it. 



Tub interoffice buzzer on my 
phone rang. It was Helix Spardleton, patent attorney extraordinary 
— and my boss. 

"Saddle?" Helix said. "Marcture 
is on the phone. Take care of him, 
will you?*' And he hung up. 

l'or a moment I just sat there, 
phone in hand. Marcharc! My 
palms were suddenly moist. Other 
patent lawyers had nice normal 
scientists to work with— people who 
invented new and patentable plastics, pharmaceuticals, and insecticides. 

I had Marcharc. My mind ran 
back over some of his inventions — 
synthetic babies, supersonic washing 
machines, hair-growing chemicals 
Collectively they had netted him a 
small fortune, but they had brought 
nothing but headaches to me. Now 
he was on the phone again. Another invention undoubtedly. 

My forefinger shook a little as 
I stabbed it at the lighted button 
on the phone. "Saddle speaking," 
I said. 

"Good morning, Carl!" came 
cheerily. "This is Marcharc You 
sound a little weak. You're not ill, 
I hope?" 



Leonard Lockhard is an experienced patents attorney who can slip the glovelike surfaces of an inventor' s nightmare on his writing hand uith a dexterity

THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION 



89 



"Well, I'm not feeling exactly — " 

"Glad to hear it. Look, I wonder if you could drop over at my 
lab. I've run across something interesting, and 1 think we ought to 
investigate the patent possibilities." 

I swallowed dryly. "What is it?" 

"A diving suit." 

I pondered his reply suspiciously, was it conceivable that "Doc" 
had finally thought up a beautiful 
routine invention for me to work 
with — one that wouldn't get mc all 
fouled up with the Patent Office? 
It wasn't too likdy. Still — a diving 
suit. How could I get into trouble 
with a mere diving suit? Surely I 
was on safe ground there. 

I said, "Fine, Doc. Shall I come 
over now?" 

"The sooner the better," he replied. "I'll wait for you." 

"Is there anything I should bring 
along? The camera?" 

"Your notebook is all you'll 
need," he assured me. "I'm not 
yet ready to test it underground. 
Sec you soon." He hung up.
I hung up myself and had half 
risen from my desk when I suddenly stiffened. Under ground . His diving suit worked underground! I 
was plenty startled, but as I thought 
it over I decided that Marcharc 
must have been mistaken. He'd 
meant underwater — just a slip of 
the tongue. Sure, that was it. Who 
ever heard of a diving suit that 
went underground? It was too fantastic. 

I felt better almost immediately. 
I got my hat and notebook and 



went out into the bright sunshine 
and hailed a cab. 

On the way to Marchare's laboratory I did some thinking. lie 
was a brilliant man capable of almost anything, a man who seldom 
made mistakes. His tongue wouldn't slip — not on a thing like that. 
If he said underground he meant 
underground. It was a statement I 
had to accept. 

By the time the cab pulled up 
in front of Marchare's laboratory 
in Alexandria I knew exactly where 
I stood. I knew for sure that he 
had gone and invented a diving suit 
that would go underground. 

"Doc" Marcharc was dressed in 
his usual clothes, which is just another way of saying he looked as 
though he'd only recently got back 
from an unsuccessful, but jovial 
panhandling expedition. 

"You got over here quickly, 
Carl. You're anxious to get going, 
eh?" 

I forced a sickly smile. 

"That's the spirit," he saidi 
thumping me on the shoulder. 
"Come along, let's have a look at 
it." 

He led me down the hall and 
into a cluttered work room where 
Hamilton Eskew, his cadaverous assistant, was workirfg on something 
that looked like a large pair of 
coveralls. 

Marchare said, "I'll describe the 
suit to you. If you have any questions just break in and ask them. 
It's really quite simple." 

I said, "Uh-huh," pulled out my 



90 TANTAST1C 

notebook, flexed my fingers, and 
was all set. 

"Externally," he said, "it closely 
resembles any self-contained underwater suit. The body portion is all 
in one piece. The helmet clamps 
down over the head, and the pack 
on the back contains the power 
supply. Any power supply can be 
used so long as it delivers approximately ten amperes at ten thousand volts for a reasonable period 
of time." 

I scribbled busily. "Got it," I 
told him. 

"The current passes to a cabbagite crystal, then to a selector box, 
and finally to the surface of the 
suit," he went on. "Control dials 
mounted inside the hands of the 
suit enable the operator to control 
the- amount of current at various 
places on the surface." 

I broke in, "Cabbagite sounds 
familiar. Precisely what is it?" 

"Well," said Marchare, "I'm not 
quite certain. Carbon, you see, occurs in two allotropic crystalline 
forms— diamonds and graphite. 
I've prepared a third allotrope that 
I call cabbagite. It is a twinned 
crystal with peculiar properties, to 
say the least. When an electromotive force is impressed at one end 
of it the other end emits energy 
of varying wave lengths. The bombardment of this energy seems to 
nullify the cohesive forces between 
the molecules of matter. 

"Up until now the only use I 
could find for it was in transforming oxygen to ozone. When you 



UNIVERSE 

plug it into the wall socket, you 
have a wonderful cabbage-cooking 
deodorizer. Spardleton filed a case 
on that use a couple of years ago. 
A few weeks ago I discovered the 
crystal had other possibilities. I've 
now discovered that it works on 
solid matter as well as oxygen. The 
solid matter yields and flows when 
pushed on by a conductive object 
that is connected to an activated 
cabbagite crystal." 

I asked, "But how docs the cabbagite crystal allow the diving suit 
to move around underground—through solid earth?" 

Out of the corner of my eye I 
noticed that Eskew was shaking 
his head in sneering compassion 
for my slow-witted grasp of the 
technical details. Dut Marchare didn't mind a bit, having had long 
experience with patent attorneys. 

"Well," he said, . "the energy 
from the crystal goes first to a 
selector unit. From there it passes 
to the surface of the suit by means 
of thousands of tiny wire leads. 
These leads connect [o a wire fabric 
imbedded in the thin rubber from 
which the suit is made. Is that 
clear?" 

"Of course," I assured him loftily, ignoring Eskcw's subdued 
snicker. 

"The control dials work this 
way," continued Marchare. "Once 
the diver is underground he can 
cut off the energy field beneath the 
soles of his feet. Thus he will 
have something solid to stand on. 
When he walks, though, he will 



THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION 



91 



have to keep the soles of his feet 
pointed away from the direction of 
his advance, or retreat, because 
only the ground under his soles 
will always be solid. Either that, 
or he can adjust the controls each 
time he moves his foot. 

"The control built into the right 
hand will control the right half of 
the suit; the left hand one will control the left. The energy field over 
the rest of the suit isn't so important as long as it is strong enough 
to soften the surrounding earth. 
Hut even so we're going to make it 
possible for the diver to control the 
energy field on the entire surface. 
That way he could even lie down 
if he wanted to." 

"Since you haven't finished the 
suit yet," I said, "how do you know 
it will work?" 

Eskew looked up at me as though 
I had just taken a dime from a 
five-year-old. 

Marchare never turned a hair. 
"Oh, it will work all right. We've 
already made a great many tests. 
We've thrust objects through walls 
and rocks and metals. Hamilton 
hasn't actually finished the diving 
suit. But when lie does, you can 
rest assured it will come up to expectations." 

"What," I asked, "happens to 
the diver if the crystal stops functioning while he's underground?" 

"Now there's a disturbing 
thought," mused Marchare, "I 
guess the suit would be lost. Gravity would pull it down to the center of the earth." 



Eskew cackled mirthlessly. "And 
would the diver be burned up." 

Marchare smiled indulgently. "A 
card, that Hamilton. Actually, 
there'd be no pain. Hani has timed 
the air supply to fail long before 
the diver can reach the center of 
the earth." 

The hair on the back of my neck 
relaxed a little. I forced myself to 
consider only the legal aspects of 
the subject at hand. "When will 
the suit be ready?" I asked. 

"In about four months," grunted Eskew. "Possibly a little 
sooner." 

"That's good," I told him. "I 
think the Patent Office may want 
a demonstration. If I can prepare 
and file the application within the 
next two weeks, the Office will 
probably take it up just about the 
time the suit is ready." 

"What I don't understand," said 
Marchare, "is how we can file a 
patent application on something 
that doesn't yet exist. Won't it be 
perjury for me to sign the inventor's oath?" 

"That would depend on what 
oath you sign," I told him. "Fortunately there are two kinds. In one 
you swear that everything in the 
application is true. In the second 
you merely swear that the object 
described in the specifications is 
your invention. I never heard of 
any inventor using the first kind. 
You don't think Selden ever actually made the automobile he patented, do you?" 



92 FANTASTIC 

"I see," he said, with an expression that said he didn't at all. 

I looked over my notes. Mr. 
Spardleton had previously explained 
that it was useless to take notes on 
a new invention because the attorney's version never agreed with the 
inventor's. What was, even worse, 
neither bore any resemblance to 
the hash the patent examiners 
would inevitably make of it. My 
notes were sufficiently confused to 
gladden the heart of any practicing 
patent attorney. 

"Well, I guess that's it," I said. 
I shook hands with, Marchare, 
returned Eskew's sneer cordially, 
and headed back to town. Plans 
for the coming tussle with the Patent Office were beginning to take 
shape in my head. But I foresaw 
no great difficulty. This was real 
invention. Imagine. A diving suit 
that went underground. Even the 
Examiner would have to admit that 
this was creative originality of the 
highest order. He couldn't turn me 
down. He wouldn't dare. 

When I got back to the office I 
went in and explained the whole 
thing to Spardleton. He heard me 
all the way through without an 
interruption. When I had exhausted my vocabulary of superlatives 
he sat quietly for a moment thinking. Then he said, "Yes, it seems 
straightforward enough. I'll tell you 
what. Make a search and pull a 
couple of patents that describe the 
usual diving suits. You will be able 
to use large portions of the specifications." 



UNIVERSE 

"How can I?" I asked. "Those 
patents will only describe diving 
suits that 30 underwater. They 
won't—" 

He cut me off with an airy wave 
of his hand. "Whenever you hit 
the word 'underwater,' change it 
to 'underground.' When you hit 
the word "sea,' change it to 
'ground' or 'earth.' You'll save a 
lot of time that way. Okay, you're 
on your own. But let me see the 
spec before you file it." 

I left and went over to the Patent Office to make the search. I 
flipped through the patents in Class 
2, Subclass 2,1, and selected two 
patents to serve as models. I realized almost immediately that I'd 
be able to use large portions of 
them. It seemed like a good idea 
at the time. 

During the next ten days I wrote 
and re-wrote. I ■ consulted with 
Marchare on several occasions, and 
I worked closely with Eskew to 
make sure that his drawings would 
be comprehensible to a man from 
Mars— or a patent examiner. Even 
at lunch Susan, our secretary, and 
I talked about the diving suit and 
hardly anything else. I ate, slept, 
and breathed the suit. I became convinced that it was going to be a 
perfect application. The Patent Office wouldn't get to first base with 
its exotic logic this time. 

Susan was a gem. She never even 
frowned when I changed my mind 
several times about how best to 
drive home a telling point. She just 
tore up the old copy and made a 



new one from my dictation. Sometimes, though, she hid i funny 
little half -smile on her face as 
though she knew something which 
I didn't. I asked her about it once. 
She didn't say a word, just reached 
over and patted me on top of the 
head. Somehow it made me feel 
like a Pekinese. But I refused to 
let it worry me. I was too busy 
creating a perfect pa:ent specification. 

The opening paragraph in my 
specification read: 

This invention relate: to a suit 
of apparel, particularly designed 
for the protection of a diver, and 
has for its object to provide a diving suit of novel construction that 
may be comfortably worn by a person,, be capable of yielding at all 
toe joints of the wearer's body, bs 
earihproof and airtight, be self-contained as to air supply, be tight, 
strong, and durable, afford means 
for the descent of a diver in various 
depths of dirt, and enable the deepground diver to move around freely through rock, stone, and earth 
of varying composition. 

The final draft consisted of 
■ seven pages of drawings, ten pages 
of spec, and twenty-eight claims. 
I sat at my desk for a good thirty 
minutes pridefully staring at the 
lovely stack of papers. I read over 
some of the more brilliant passages, 
rolling the words on my tongue, 
amazed at what a clear picture they 
painted. Convinced tharit was now 
a masterpiece of logic and persuas


THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION 

iveness, I took it i 



93 

for Spardleton's 
approval. 

He picked it up and began to 
read. I waited confidently, convinced that be could hardly fail 
to see in it the sure band of genius 
He finished it far more rapidly 
than I would have thought possible 
"Urn," he said, tossing it back to 
me, "It'll do. File it." 

Susan made out a check for 
thirty-eight dollars and I mailed 
the whole mess to the Patent Office. 

The next couple of months 
passed swiftly. Under Spardleton's 
expert tutelage my wo/king fund 
of patent knowledge blossomed 
and grew. I learned bow to write 
page after page of patent specification without actually saying anything. I achieved an amazing degree of tonal control over my voice. 
By simply saying to an Examiner. 
"I don't quite agree with you 
there," I was able to suggest by 
the tone of my voice alone lhat 1 
knew he bad received his scientific 
education by the rudimentary osmotic process of sitting on his IcxL 
books. Sometimes it worked. 

Then one day Spardlc:on seni 
for me. 

He was evidently busy trying to 
decipher an Office Action when 1 
entered. Webster's Unabridged 
stood open on its stand beside bis 
desk and at least six volumes of 
the Britannica were scattered about 
on the floor. The desk itself was 
littered with thesauruses and handbooks and I noticed particularly 



94 FANTASTIC 

Partridge's Dictionary of Slang and 
Unconventional English. 

As soon as I walked in lie asked, 
"Did you ever hear of the word 
'sludutiferous?' " 

"I'm afraid not," I said. 

"Well, there is such a word. I 
found it faese." He waved vaguely 
at the forest of books on his desk. ' 
"And I must say I'm a little disappointed in the Examiner. I don't 
know what the Patent Office is coming to when they begin using words 
that are actually in existence." He 
looked at the initials in the upper 
left-hand corner of the Office Action. "Oh," he said, brightening 
considerably. "Maybe that explains 
it, Old Nailgood. He's just allowed 
several claims in Marchare's cabbagite deodorizer case. He must be 
slipping fast." 

His smile vanished and his brows 
drew together. "Still, there's something phony here. Cabbagite is a 
real invention. It's a money maker 
for Marcharc, and a boon to the 
housewife. There's something remotely similar in the prior art.. It's 
very odd, therefore, that the office 
is willing to give us a patent on it. 
.Unless — " 

"Unless what?" 

"Unless they want to allow it, 
in order to use the allowed claims 
to reject March are on some other 
application of even greater importance. Does he have any co-pending 
applications relating to cabbagite?" 

"None that I know of," I said, 
"How about that diving suit?" 



UNIVERSE 

I stared at him, startled. "Surely 
you don't mean they'd reject a 
diving suit on a ileodori2er? What 
kind of sanity is that?" 

He gave me a pumled look. 
"Sanity? What's sanity got to do 
with it?" 

I hadn't got around to answering him when Susan walked in and 
handed Spardleton a letter — clearly 
a communication from an Examiner. He tore it open and scanned 
It quickly. 

"Ah, hah," he said. "Look here. 
This explains everything." 

I circled around behind htm. It 
was an Office Action, all right. And 
it was in reference to the diving 
suit application. 

The hrst thing I noticed were the 
initials in the upper left-hand corner: H. K. Herbert Krome! Mister 
Patent Office himself— the evil 
genius who handled patent lawyers 
the way an animal trainef handles 
big cats. A single glance showed 
me how serious— and nasty— it was. 

"This application has been examined

Examiner. 

"Sec?" said Spfirdlefoo, his features dark. "Just as I thought. He's 
using our own application agatnsl 

MS." 

We were quiet for a moment. 

"There's another matter," said 
Spardleton. "Marchare says the Department of Defense has been dickering with him for rights under 
his diving suit application. I told 
him to stall them until he gets an 
allowance. If he can't get a patent, 
the government can award manufacturing rights to anyone and not 
have to pay Marchare a nickel. 

"Actually, they prefer a license 
under a patent. It avoids any chance 
of suits in the U. S. Court of 
Claims by twenty or more halfbaked inventors who think Defense 
stole the idea from them. So time 
is of the essence." 

I said, "If I could demonstrate 
a suit to Kiome, I'm sure he'd allow the case immediately. But I 
don't think the suit has been completed yet. Have you heard from 
Marchare?" 

"l phoned him about it a couple 
of weeks ago," said Spardleton. 
"He told me it wasn't quite ready. 
When I asked him to be specific 
he mumbled something about bugs 
in the control system." Spardleton 
studied rnc thoughtfully. 



"I can at least show the suit to 
Krome," I said uneasily. 

"I think it'll take more than 
that," Spardleton said. 

"Maybe I could fill it with rocks 
and let it down into the ground 
on a rope," I suggested brightly. 

"Kromc won't buy that." Spardleton frowned and seemed lost in 
thought for a moment. "Still, if I 
know Krome as well as I think I 
do it may work out all right. You'd 
better arrange for an interview this 
afternoon, and then run out and 
get the suit — as is, Marchare said 
you could have it anytime." 

As I left to lake care of things, 
a slow introspective smile was 
spreading over Spardleton's face. 

Each patent lawyer must develop 
his own technique for interviewing 
Examiners. Some shout and rave 
and rant. But that is foolhardy. One 
, slip, and the show is over. Others 
play dumb and act as if they haven't the slightest idea what the score 
is. That encourages the Examiner 
to talk himself out on a limb. Still 
others employ the yakcty-yak system wherein they never give the 
Examiner a chance to open his 
mouth. It is a subterfuge which is 
only used by those who don't dare 
(Beet the Examiner in fair and open 
combat. Others use the buddy-to. -buddy approach in which the attorney manages to convince the 
Examiner that he and the Examiner — and especially the Examiner 
— are the only two people in the 
whole world who really understand 
patents. 



'JO FANTASTH 

After due consideration T had 
decided to use an absolutely unique 
approach, one never thought of before. 

I was going to be myself. 

I had a good invention, the application WAS well-written and 
everything was just as it should 
be. I had no need to resort to deception, or evasion. Besides, I had 
seen what Krome could do to attorneys with a system. He took the 
system, rolled it up in a compact 
ball, and fanned them out with it, 
scoring his three strikes without 
once unbending. 

At two o'clock sharp, with the 
diving suit under my arm, I stepped 
up to Mr. Krome's desk. 

"Mr. Krome?" I inquired, with 
just the proper amount of rhetorical deference. 

"Yes, yes. What is it?" he said 
without even looking up. 

"I'd like to talk to you, sir, if I 
may. It's about the Marchare case, 
the diving suit—" 

I knew Krome quite well, but 
still he asked me coldly, "Are you 
the attorney of record?" 

"Yes, sir," was my instant reply. He knew I was— and he knew 
I knew that he knew. But it was 
part of his routine, and I didn't 
want to irritate him by abbreviating the amenities." 

"I can spare you ten minutes," 
he grumbled. "1 have an important 
appointment with the Commissioner at two-thirty." 

I said, "Ten minutes will be 
quite sufficient."

"Just a second while I get the 
case," he said. He got up and disappeared into the Clerk's room. 

Five minuies later he returned, 
and steamed back to his desk, my 
application clutched tightly in his 
hand. 

"Yes," he said, without even 
looking at it, "part of my rejection 
"-as on probable inoperabilky. 
Have you got a working model 
there?" 

"I certainly have," I replied. 
"Thought you might not believe it 
even when you see it. This is absolutely the most — " 

"Why won't I believe it when 
I sec it?" be demanded. 

"Well, J just meant — *' 

"U this a. trick of some kind?" 
he bridled. 

"No. Oh, no. 1 just — " 

"Well, why won't I believe it 
when I see it?" 

"1 didn't mean it that way," I 
said quickly, "T meant — " 

"I heard what you said. Let me 
remind you of Rule Three. Interviews with Examiners must be conducted with decorum. No frivolity, 
understand ?" 

"I'm sorry," I apologized. 
"You'll believe it. Honest you 
will." 

He stared at me suspiciously. 
"We'll see. Bring it into the next 
room." He stalked off. 

I picked up the box, and staggered after him into the conference foom. 

"Open it up," he commanded. 

I dumped the suit on the table.

He felt the texture of the cloth. 
"It doesn't look like much," he 
siitl. "And look here" Very deliberately he stretched the diving 
suit out full length. "Doesn't that 
look just like an ordinary diving 
suit?" he asked. 

"Yes, but—" 

"Isn't its design similar to that 
of any diving suit?" 
"Yes, but—'* 

"And a diver underground acts 
the same as a diver underwater," 

"Well, sure. But — " 

"And, as a matter of fact, listen 
to this." Krome picked up the 
application and read a few paragraphs to me. "Now," he said, "all 
I have to do is change the word 
'underground* to underwater,' 
change the word 'ground - or 'earth' 
to 'sea,' and I have a perfect description of a deepsei diving suit. 
Am I right?" 

"I know all that," I said. 
"But—" 

"Well, then — there is no invention here. Once the cabbagitc crystal is known it become; so obvious 
that any routineer could use it in 
a diving suit. A new use of an old 
thing or an old process cannot be 
patented. Rcgar & Sons, Incorporated versus Scott and Williams, Incorporated." 

I protested, "But wait a minute. 
Wait until I demonstrate it for you. 
Ml tie this rope on gad then — " 

"No you don't," he said. "You 
don't pull any rope tricks on me. 
I've read the spec. I know how it's 



supposed to work, /'// put it on." 
And he began to climb into it. 

"Kindly stop opening and closing your mouth," he said, "and 
help me with the helmet." 

"Please," I gasped. "The controls aren't — " 

"Put the helmet on," he said. 
"But the controls aren't—" 
"Put the helmet on," he insisted 
With nerveless fingers I obeyed. 
I can remember wondering whether 
there was anything in his life insurance policy that would hive covered a possibly fatal outcome. I 
hoped they wouldn't make his 
widow and children wait seven 
years. 

I turned to glance at the door 
to see if there were any witnesses. 
No one was watching. I turned 
back to Krome and noticed with 
alarm that he appeared to have 
grown shorter. For a moment I 
thought he had fallen to his knees. 
But then I saw that he was slowlysinking through the Moor. 

I made gestures with my hands 
in front of his face plate in a frantic attempt to show him how to 
operate the controls. Lower and 
lower he sank. I followed him right 
down to the floor until he disappeared through it, leaving me on 
my hands and knees staring at the 
blank and dusty tiles. 

Then I realized with horror that 
we were on the seventh floor. 

I turned and rushed out of the 
room and down the hall to the 
stairway. I tore down the stairs, 
and out into the hall below. I ran 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



for the room directly underneath 
the one where Krome had been. 
Before I could reach it several skkcningly-curdlcd screams resounded 
through the corridor, and I heard 
the muffled bangs of things crashing to the floor. A few loose papers 
floated out through the open door. 

I pulled up in the doorway, and 
looked in. 

There were five patent attorneys 
in the room, waiting their turn To 
be heard by the Board of Appeals. 
Krome was in the middle of the 
room up to his waist in the floor. 
His arms flailed wildly as he tried 
to keep his balance. 

The panic-stricken attorneys 
stood on tables and chairs hurling 
whatever they could lay their hands 
on at the monster that confronted 
thetn. Books, inkwells, and brief 
cases rained around Krome's helmetcd figure. Finally one of the attorneys reached down and hoisted 
a chair high over his head. 

Krome saw it and raised an arm 
in terrified protest. For the first 
time his voice came out through 
the speaker attached to the diving 
suit. "No! No!" he screamed. But 
it did no good. With fear-driven 
muscles the attorney launched the 
chair at Krome. It struck him sharply across the chest. 

The two shattered ends of the 
chair hurtled past him, and crashed 
against the opposite wall. The middle portion that had hit his body 
Battened out like water against the 
sort. Part of it flowed down, and 
foiwcd wooden puddles on the 



floor. Other parts spl ashed out 
sideways in little streamlets that 
solidified into splinters and sprinkled all over the floor. 

The attorneys stared bug-eyed at 
what had happened to the chair. 
For a brief instant they were paralyzed. Then, moving as a single 
man, all five of them made a dive 
for the doorway. I was directly in 
their path, and I never had a 
chance. 

I was a wreck when the stampede 
had passed over me. My nose was 
bleeding profusely, my left trouserleg was ripped off at the knee, and 
my right sleeve was gone. There 
were even footprints on my naked 
chest. 

I crawled back to the door and 
looked in. Krome was gone I got 
to my feet and slowly started to 
walk toward the stairs. I tried in 
vain to stem the flow of blood with 
my shirttail. One eye was swelling 
fast, and a front tooth had worked 
loose. 

1 wandered out into the hcxt 
lower corridor in search of Krome. 
J looked in at the doorway of what 
seemed to be the proper room. It 
was. The Primary Examiner was 
sitting at his desk talking to an 
ashen-faced young fellow. Neither 
of them was saying anything. Their 
eyes were fixed on a stationary 
point at one corner of the Primary's 
desk. At first I couldn't tell what 
it was. Then I caught a movement, 
and my heart sank. 

Krome had descended on the 
Primary's desk. Apparently he had 



THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION" 



99 



thrashed around while trying to get 
his balance, and now he was halfstuck in the desk. I got there just 
in time to see the helmet, right side 
up at last, take up a fixed position 
at one end of a shelf of books. 

"Oh," said the Primary peering 
in through the faceplate. "I'm glad 
you dropped in, Krome. I'd like 
you to meet Jones, our newest junior 
Examiner. He just joined us today. 
Mr. Jones, Mr. Kromc." There was 
a bitler, almost savage irony in his 
voice. 

Krome nodded curtly, only his 
head visible above the desk top. His 
arm came out of the desk as he 
started to shake hands. But he 
thought belter of it and his arm 
dropped out of sight again. Jones 
just sat there, white, tense. 

The Primary nodded. "Some misguided applicant has just cut his 
own throat by persuading Mr. 
Kromc to try out his invention." 
He turned to Jones. "There's a 
good lesson here. The inventor has 
inertly substituted stone for water. 
In processes it's a common expedient to substitute one ordinary 
medium for another. Diving suits 
are no exception. 'Mere gadgetcering." 

Jones just sat there staring at 
Kromc's head. I don't think he 
heard anything the Primary said. I 
could see that if anybody was going to defend my application, I'd 
have to do it myself. I walked into 
the room and took up the battle. 

"But how," I demanded, "oa 
you reject in inventor on his ova 



co-pending application — one that 
hasn't even been issued as a patent?" 

Krome gave me a pained look 
through the quartz porthole. "Section one hundred and two, A, says 
the invention must not have been 
known before the invention by the 
applicant. There's no inventive ad-_ 
vance in the diving suit over Marchare's prior cabbagite application. 
Hence, in effect, the diving suit 
invention was known when Marchare invented cabbagite." 

I blinked at his steady black eyes. 
"You mean," I said, "like jet 
planes were known when the Chinese invented the sky rocket?" 

"Precisely. This concept of patent law is so sound, so logical, that 
I can't understand why the Supreme 
Court took nearly a hundred and 
fifty years to swing around to it. 
And, of course, when it's the inventor's own prior work that's used 
to reject a current application, the 
situation is a double strike against 
him." He leered at me triumphantly. "How can a man be smarter 
than himself?" 

*'But even the Supreme Court 
says you can't reject an application 
on a combination merely because 
you can tind all its elements in the 
prior art," I protested. "There can 
still be a patentable invention in 
combining those elements. Here the 
invention consists of combining 
cabbagite and a diving suit. Nobody ever thought of that before." 

"Of course they never thought 
of it before," he explained patient


TOO 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



ly. "They couldn't, because they 
never heard of cabbagite before." 

"Then nobody but Marchare 
could invent the diving suit." 

"Quite true. But the minute he 
invented it, it became non-invention, because, since it was he who 
invented it, it didn't require invention." 

The new Examiner finally recovered bis faculties; He slapped both 
hands on his knees, got up, and 
said, "Well, so long, sir. By resigning right now I may have a 
lighting chance of retaining my sanity." And he walked out the side 
door shaking his head. 

"What's the matter with him?" 
asked the Primary in a puzzled 
voice. 

Krome said, "I don't know. Perhaps he—" He stopped. The helmet 
had suddenly dropped a couple of 
inches further into the desk. It hung 
there a split second, then dropped 
a few inches more. Step by step he 
was slipping down. We heard his 
muffled voice coming out of the 
desk through the cracks around the 
drawers, but we couldn't understand what he said. The Primary 
and I leaned over to look under 
the desk. Wc watched the floor 
close over the helmet. 

The Primary straightened up, and 
glared at me. "Well," he said. "If 
you'll excuse me, I have lots ot 
work to do." 

"Oh, sure," I said. "I have to 
go find Mr. Krome anyway. Goodbye, and thanks for your trouble." 

"No trouble, no trouble," he re


torted with a venomous inflection, 
picking up a document from his 
desk top and beginning to read it. 

I trotted on down to the room 
underneath. 

The door was closed, and on it 
in big letters were the words NARCOTICS BUREAU. I carefully 
opened the door and looked inside. 

it was a small room, and there 
were only four men in it. Three of 
them were bent intently over their 
desks. But the fourth man had 
tilted back in his chair for a moment's reflection and contemplation. His hands were clasped behind his head, and everything about 
him was* normal — except his eyes. 
No human eyes should ever protrude the way his did. 

Krome hung suspended from the 
ceiling. Everything below his collar bone was in plain sight, and 
most of it was thrashing around 
noiselessly. For about ten seconds 
it continued thus — the immobile 
narcotics expert, the quivering 
Krome. Then Krome managed to 
turn on the energy field in the 
upper part of the suit. Without a 
sound he slipped out of the ceiling, fell through the floor, and 
disappeared. 

Nobody saw him go except mc 
and the thinker. That amazing gentleman swallowed hard and sat upright. A quick glance convinced 
him that none of die others had 
noticed anything wrong. He swallowed again, sighed heavily, and 



THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION 



101 



then methodically began to clean 
out his desk. 

As I was sadly closing the door, 
I realized with sudden consternation that Krome was dropping toward the Search Room on the 
ground floor. And the ceiling there 
was over twenty feet high. I began 
to run again. 

The Search Room was quiet 
when I burst into it, holding my 
tattered and blood-caked clothing 
tightly around me. The occupants 
of the room gave me strange looks, 
but they were so used to having 
screwballs around that nobody said 
anything. I kept my eyes on the 
.ceiling. 

Tor a moment there was no sign 
of Krome. Then off to one side, 
over near the entrance where the 
patent bundles were kept, a foot 
appeared from the ceiling. It moved 
around as if seeking a firm place to 
stand, and then quickly withdrew 
back into the ceiling. It cautiously 
reappeared a moment later, closer 
to the huge pillars that stretched 
down to the floor. Again it sought 
a footing. 

I heaved a sigh of relief. Krome 
evidently knew where he was, and 
was taking no chances. As I stared 
the foot vanished for the second 
timeIt came into view again an instant later, this time about eighteen 
inches from the arch at the summit of the pillars. It flitted around 
and found the pillar. Hands flashed 
through* the ceiling as Krome paddled himself over, and then care


fully lowered himself out of the 
ceiling and into the arch at the top. 
Large portions of him were now 
in plain view. 

The uproar from the floors above 
had been steadily increasing in volume. The people in the Search 
Room were glancing questioningly 
at one another. And just as Krome 
was about to complete his transfer 
to the pillar one of the patent 
stenographers saw him. 

Her screams all but shattered 
every window in the block-long 
room. Everybody froze. All eyes 
followed the stenographers hand 
that was pointing to where Krome 
was just beginning to descend, half 
in and half out of the pillar. A 
long moment of stark silence gave 
a kind of funeral dirge significance 
to what followed. 

There were only two exits. I was 
smart this time, I stood off to one 
side as the terrified occupants of 
the room leaped over the search 
tables like gazelles fleeing from a 
lion. Chairs were crushed to pulpwood. Many people had been back 
in the stacks when the commotion 
started, and were now emerging 
with their arms loaded with 
bundles of patents. Instantly the air 
was thick with flying documents. 

1 couldn't help but admire the 
consummate skill with which Krome 
descended the column. His rear end 
protruded as he stepped slowly 
down. Every four or five feet, he'd 
stop, turn around, and thrust his 
head out to make sure where he 
was. Then he'd disappear for a 



102 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



moment, out would come his backside again, and the slow descent 
would resume. 

There was a revolving fan fastened to the pillar about seven feet 
above the floor, I watched, fascinated, as Krome got closer and closer 
to it. Finally fan and fanny met. 
The blades flowed into long slivers 
of metal that shot across the room 
and spanned off the walls. The motor, relieved of its load, began to 
race faster and faster. 

Krome must have felt the gentle 
blows of the blades because his 
hand reached out of the piUai and 
brushed at them as though he were 
shooing a fly. His hand passed 
through the fan support. There 
was a shower of sparks and a little 
smoke curled up. The fan sagged 
forward on its support and then 
solidified as Krome's hand moved 
on through. I never saw a sorrier 
looking device than that fan once 
Krome got through with it. The 
electricians would be in for a bad 
few hours trying to figure out what 
had happened to it. 

Krome finally reached the floor, 
stepped out of the pillar, turned 
off the suit, and heaved a big sigh. 
He turned around and for the first 
time got a good look at the Search 
Room. Most of the chairs were 
reduced to rubble. Many of the 
large search tables were overturned 
and broken and Krome himself 
stood knee-deep in patents. 

Krome gave one puzzled and uncomprehending glance at all this. 
Then, he looked at the clock over 



the door. "Good grief t" he 
groaned. "Two thirty-five! The 
Commissioner!" He turned and 
ran through one of the archways 
that opened into the stacks. I lit 
out after him. 

He had turned the suit on again, 
except for the soles of -the feet, 
This gave him a decided advantage 
over me. He could take short cuts " 
through solid walls. He went 
through the back wall of the stacks 
without even slowing down. 

I cut off to one side through the 
door that led into the foreign art. 
I stopped and listened. From the 
other end of the long law room I 
heard, a sudden splintering crash. 
I raced on in trepidation. A man 
was standing near the Swedish art 
A broken pint bottle lay at his feet 
and whiskey was lapping at the 
soles of his shoes. His forefinger 
was half-crooked in front of his 
face. But it was his bulging eyes, 
aimed at a section of the Willi, which 
pointed out the direction Krome 
had taken. As I turned from him 
he collapsed, head in hands, and 
began to sob quietly. 

I quickly found my way to the 
back corridor. As I proceeded down 
it, the now-familiar ruckus started 
up in the Mail Room. Women 
screamed, men shouted, and heavy 
objects thumped on the Moor. 
Krome had used very poor judgment in cutting through the Mail 
Room. But how was he to know 
that the people in it were not scientifically-minded? 

I waited until one of the doors 



THE MAGNIFICENT PROFESSION 



10 J 



stopped spewing people, and then 
leaped resolutely inside. One glance 
convinced me that the Patent Office would not be running smoothly for a considatable period to come. 
Several of the clerks had dropped 
to their knees and were praying, 
some quietly, some loudly. 

There wsze papers everywhere. 
And an empty mailbag dangled 
1 i i nply from an overhead 1 ight, 
looking startlingly like the victim 
of an over-wrought hangman. One 
man sat on the floor in front of a 
pile of thousands of newly-arrived 
applications, He was laughing insanely and tossing repeated handful* of applications high overhead. 
Petitions, checks, notarized oaths, 
drawings, and fragments of applications slithered through the air 
like snowflakes in a blizzard. 
Krome had passed through, all 
right. 

I walked amidst the bedlam unnoticed seeking some sign of 
Krome. I couldn't figure out where 
he had gone. Then suddenly I had 
it— his two-thirty appointment with 
the Commissioner. 

1 jumoed to a window and looked out. My heart almost stopped 
beating at what I saw. 

A girl was walking away from 
me along the sidewalk, her hips 
swinging up and down like the 
ends of a seesaw. Kroine was plowing along right behind her, completely out of control, getting closer 
all the time. He was tilted forward 
pawing at the ground with his 
hands, now submerged to his neck, 



now above ground to his ankles. 
The girl had ignored his first frantic 
warnings, so Krome shouted again. 
She threw an annoyed glance back 
over one shoulder and — the seesaw 
froze. 

Krome churned closer and closer. 
My heart was in my mouth. I had 
no idea what would happen when 
the diving suit bumped into a live 
human being. I stopped breathing. 

Closer and closer! Then just as 
a collision seemed inevitable Krome 
executed a rather neat surface dive 
into the pavement which carried him 
safely and spectacularly underneath 
her feet. Almost instantly he reappeared on the other side doing a 
strong overhand stroke which quickly put a safe distance between himself and the grievously threatened 
young lady. She toppled over in a 
dead faint. 

I dashed into the next building, 
into an office where a short, heavyset man stood bending over a huge 
desk. I recognized him in a flash. 
The Commissioner of Patents ! 

At the Commissioner's desk side 
sat a man in uniform — a two-star 
general. 

It added up. T thought fast. 
Krome — - the Commissioner — the 
gene red. 

I cleared my throat as they lookd 
up blankly. "I beg your pardon," I 
said politely. "I'm Mr. Saddle, Dr. 
Marcharc's attorney in the diving 
suit case. Mr. Krome suggested I be 
here during his appointment on this 
matter." 

"Really?" grunted the Commis


FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



104 

sioner. "And where is Mr. Krorhe?" 
"He said he'd be passing through 

any moment now," I said hurriedly. 

Just then Krome walked in 
through the north wall. Fortunately 
neither die general nor the Commissioner saw him until he stepped 
out from the wall. 

The Commissioner glared at 
Krome, then at his desk clock. 
"You're late," he chided. "However, since- you brought the suit, 
that'll save time. Gentlemen, this is 
Genera! Bond, Secret Weapons 
Bureau, Department of Defense." 

Krome got it immediately too. 
But, like other people who live by 
their wits, my reflexes were faster. 
I said smoothly, "Mr. Krome and 
I have just been giving the suit a 
tryout, and he invited me along to 
the conference." I beamed sideways 
at Krome. "He finds all the claims 
allowable, and my client stands pre-" 
pared to license the Secretary of Defense to manufacture, at a very reasonable royalty, any and all — " 
"But — " sputtered Krome. 
"Mr. Krome has applied (0 most 
stringent tests." I continued hurriedly as I sidled over toward the 
encased, protesting figure. And in 
patting him jovially on the back, I 
somehow brushed against the mike 
button, chopping off the torrent in 
mid-cascade. "Oops, how careless 
of me! Oh, well, Mr. Krome will 
tell you himself, as soon as I get 
the helmet off." 

"How long will that take?" demanded General Bond. 

"Not more than three or four 



hours," I said. "If it doesn't jam." 

"Can't wait." He turned curtly 
to the Commissioner. "Phone me 
the patent number as soon as the 
application is passed to issue." 

"Yes, sir," the Commissioner replied. 

"And you, Mr. Saddle," said the 
general sternly, "had better inform 
Dr. Marchare about the penalties 
of profiteering against his government. We'll give him a trial order 
for ten thousand suits, but if he 
holds out for more than five thousand dollars pc-r suit, we'll seize the 
patent by Eminent Domain." 

"I suppose the good doctor won't 
mind taking a loss on a small trial 
order," I said reluctantly. "But, of 
course, on a mass scale, my client 
would at least have to make expenses, particularly if he adds certain improved features." 

"Hey, wait a minute," declared 
the Commissioner. "There's something funny about this. Look at 
Krome. Tears arc pouring down his 
checks !" 

"I'm sure that's sweat." I mopped 
my face hurriedly. "It's warm in 
here too, isn't it? Dr. Marchare 
intends to air-condition the suit. 
That'll bring it up to an even six 
thousand." 

"Five thousand five hundred," 
clipped the general. 

I hesitated a moment. "You're a 
hard man, general," I sighed. "But 
— all right, five thousand five hundred it is." 

And I led Krome out of the 
room. 



the 
elephant 
hound 

by . ♦ . Charles W. Price, Jr. 



He was just a big ugly old dog 
with floppy ears. But to K. Ross 
Bredd he was lightning on wheels 
and possibly— the Devil's Advocate. 



The afternoon that fellow 
came along and told us this crazy 
yarn about Old Liver-Lips, the Elep.mt Hound, we were all sitting on 
the verandah of Dave's store down 
at the intersection of Highway 51 
and the Cool Creek road. We were 
petting a Beagle pup that Bob 
Pearce had brought along and talking about bird dogs, rabbit dogs, 
coon dogs, hog dogs and other 
kinds of dogs and telling dog 
stories. 

We had been at it about an hour 
when the biggest, ugliest, oddestlooking dog you ever saw came 
down the highway, loping along, 
easy but fast, and turned off toward 
Dave's store. 

I thought I had seen just about 
every kind of dog, but I'd never set 
eyes on a dog like that before unless 
it was the night I ate too much 
barbecued goat at the Billy Wilson's 
anniversary celebration and woke 
up hollering at two in the morning. 

That dog was as big as a calf. Its 
paws were the size of your fist and 
a little puff of dust flew up every 
time they hit the ground. Its hair 
was biistly and iron gray, only it

was bluish in spots. And there were 
some brown spots, some yellow 
spots, several red spots, and a big 
Mack spot around each eye. 

This dog was bony and gaunt 
but strong-looking, like those fellows that run a mile at the track 
meet. It had big, floppy ears the 
general size and shape of a pot lid; 
sagging jowls; droopy, liver-colored 
l'l>... tod a mournful, respectful nononsense expression on its face, like 
a bloodhound. 

But Hie most remarkable thing 
about this dog was its nose. As it 
came closer, we could see that it actually had a proboscis about an inch 
long, as if it had started to grow a 
trunk like an elephant and had then 
changed its mind. As it loped along, 
its head close to the ground, this 
remarkable nose twitched and vibrated so fast you could almost hear 
il hum. 

I thought for a minute the heat 
had nie, but the other fellows saw 
the same thing. Bob Pcarcc turned 
a little pale and picked up his 
Beagle pup and stood on the bench. 

But the big dog never paid us 
any mind. It loped over to the gas 
pump and sniffed around for a second. Then it ran up the steps, across 
the verandah and into the store and 
stopped a moment at the candy 
counter, the ice cream box and the 
tobacco counter. Then it ran out to 
the gas pump again, ran back up 
the steps and sniffed at the spot 
where the Beagle pup had been lying. Finally it made another trip to 



the pump, and ran under the verandah. 

"Well for Pete's sake!" I said. 
"Who do you think that critter was 
trailing?" 

"I ean't imagine," said Dave, 
who had come to the door. "But it 
must have been somebody who 
stopped to buy some gas and immediately afterwards went in and 
got some ice cream, some candy and 
some tobacco." 

Then he must have come back 
out on the verandah," added AI 
Short, "stopped to pat that Beagle 
pup on the head, and made a couple 
of trips out to the gas pump." 

"But that's impossible," put in 
Bob Pearce. "I never brought this 
pup down here until about an hour 
ago. There's been nobody by since 
but old man Robbins and he didn't 
get out of his truck. Besides, if whoever it was stopped at the gas pump, 
it seems like he would have been in 
a car and that dog couldn't have 
f ol lowed him. At least, 1 never 
heard of a dog that could," 

"I guess he was just sniffing 
around," said Dave. "But he looks 
awful queer and I hope I don't have 
to get down and chase him out from 
under there." 

But we didn't think any more 
about it right then, because a car 
came down (he highway and turned 
off and stopped under the big oak 
tree by the gas pump, just as the 
dog had done. 

There were a man and a woman 
in the car. The woman started fixing 
her face by the rear-view mirror 



THE ELEPHANT HOUND 



107 



while the man got out and told 
Dave's boy, Jack, to fill the tank and 
check the oil ami the tires. Then he 
went in the store and bought sonic 
candy, some ice cream and a handful or" cigars. He took the candy and 
ice cream out to the woman and 
then came back and stood by the 
steps to talk and stretch his legs a 
minute. 

He lit a cigar and then readied 
over on the verandah and patted 
the Beagle pup on the head. "Fine 
looking pup you've got there," he 
said. "Think he'll make 1 good 
tracker?" 

That's the kind of question Bob 
Pcarce loves. 

"The best in the country!" he 
vowed. "Why, that little old pup's 
pappy never lost a trail in his life. 
He could trail anything. One night 
he went onl and trailed .1 Will-o'thc-Wisp fifteen miles across the 
swamp and caught it and brought it 
home in his jaws. I put it in a bird 
cage and kept it. I use it for a 
lantern." 

"Extraordinary," said the stranger. But somehow his voice sounded like he wasn't really impressed 
tt all. 

Bob gave him a sharp look and 
tried again. "But that's nothing. 
This little old pup's mammy — I 
take her flshing with me all the 
time. She can point a catfish in ten 
feet of water." 

"Hram-mm," said the stranger. 

Bob began to get a little irritated. 

"But this little old pup's great


great-great grandpappy!" he went on. "Once he sniffed an old musket 
ball somebody dug up in the y.ird 
and he trailed a company of Yankee 
soldiers forty miles to the battle of 
Port Hudson! - * 

"Pretty good nose for a Beagle," 
said the stranger. 

The rest of us were about to bust. 
Thai was all Bob could take. I Ie decided to give the stranger a chance. 
"Have you ever seen a dog with a 
better nose? " he asked. 

"Yes, I have," the stranger answered matter-of-factly. He waj a 
matter-of-fact looking fellow, about 
medium height and medium weight, 
sun-tanned, and a little bald. He 
was dressed in sport clothes, but not 
too loud. I did think that I could 
see little fine worry lines in his face 
and a nervous look In his eyes but I 
decided maybe it was just the way 
his glasses magnified them. 

"But I wouldn't want you to 
think I'm putting down on your 
Beagles," he continued. "The dog 
I'm talking about was no ordinary 
dog. Maybe I'd better introduce myself. I am K. Ross Bredd. My father 
is Thorcau W. Bredd, the dor; fancier. I don't imagine you ever have 
heard of him, because my father is 
— or was before he took up anoilicr 
hobby — a dog fancier's dog fancies, 
and not just the common variety of 
dog breeder." 

Bob, who thinks he grows the 
best Beagles in America and wants 
everybody to know it, didn't like 
that las: remark very much. Buj he 
was willing to go along with Mr. 



108 FANTASTIC 

Bredd for a while. "I take it your 
father raised some pretty fancy 
dogs," he said. 

"Oh, indeed!" said the stranger. 
"It was my father who developed 
the original hush puppy." 

"But a hush puppy isn't a dog," 
objected Abner Wheat. "It's a lump 
of fried cornmeal batter." 

"I know that's what you call a 
hush puppy down here," agreed 
the stranger, "but the original hush 
puppy was my father's non-barking 
dog. Geneticists acclaimed its development as a feat equal to the 
development of the seedless orange 
and the skinless frankfurter. And 
speaking of frankfurters reminds 
me of another unusual dog bred 
by my father." 

"Not the original hot dog!" exclaimed Bob. 

"That's right — the original hot 
dog. It's body temperature was three 
hundred and forty degrees. Father 
had to keep it in an asbestos dog 
house. It drank only boiling water 
and ate its food out of a red-hot 
skillet." 

"That's very interesting," said 
Dave. "But I don't think the hush 
puppy would be very much good as 
a watch dog or that the hot dog 
would make a very good hunting 
dog. He ■would always be starting 
brush fires everywhere he went." 

"Quite right," agreed the stranger. "My father could hunt with 
him only during a heavy rain that 
would put out fires as fast as he 
started them. Even thea it was difficult: because when the rain hit him 



UNIVERSE 

he gave off a tremendous cloud of 
steam. A spectacle in any woods, I 
can assure you. But although my 
father was a dog fancier's dog fancier and not a common dog breeder, 
he did take an interest in dogs that 
were useful as well as ornamental. 
He developed the greatest tracker 
that ever lived since the beginning 
of time, the Liver-Lipped Elephant 
Hound." 

"Well, I've only been to the circus twice in my life," interrupted 
Abner Wheat, "but from what I've 
seen of elephants, and the way they 
smell, it wouldn't take much of a 
hound to trail an elephant." 

"But this dog was so named not 
because it was used to trail elephants but because of jts physical 
characteristics," the stranger explained. "It could trail anything 
that ever walked, swam or flew. I 
once knew it to trail a man that flew 
over town in an airplane." 

At that moment the woman in 
the car called him and he went out 
and lit a cigarette for her. When he 
came back, Dave said, "Mr. Bredd, 
would you mind telling us just how 
your father went about developing 
the Liver -Lipped Elephant Hound ?" 

Nobody likes a good story better 
than Dave does. He puts his whole 
heart into listening and always believes it while it is being told. 

"Well," K. Ross Bredd began, 
"my father raised all kinds of dogs. 
Once at the International Dog 
Show he exhibited the grand champion liver-lipped potlickker hound, 
the grand champion biscuit hound, 



THE ELEPHANT HOUND 



ICQ 



the grand champion fiest and the 
grand champion flea hound. Many 
years ago he began to study the 
characteristics that make certain 
dogs among these and many other 
breeds better trackers than other 
dogs. 

"Out of his vast experience, 
father soon observed a fact that had 
escaped all other dog breeders from 
the beginning of time. That fact is 
this: Although certain breeds appear to make better trackers than 
other breeds, the truth is that it is 
not the breed at all that makes a 
dog a good tracker. It's the length 
and flexibility of its nose. Among 
all breeds, the best at following a 
trail are those individuals whose 
noses are the longest and vibrate 
the most rapidly. 

"The difference might be only a 
centimeter or less, but it is always 
there. If you will take a good look 
at your own dogs and talk to your 
friends "who own hunting dogs, you 
will find this to be invariably true. 
So from his immense collection of 
dogs, father began selecting animals with this characteristic, regardless of breed. Finally, after twenty 
years, he produced the LiverLipped Elephant Hound, the greatest tracker that ever lived." 

"It's mighty funny none of us 
ever heard of the Elephant Hound," 
Bob Pearce said. 

"It isn't so very funny," the 
stranger replied. "The distemper 
was going the rounds of my father's 
kennels at the time. Both the parents died and only one of the litter 



survived — the only Liver-Lipped 
Elephant Hound that ever existed." 

"But if they're so good," Dave 
objected, "I don't see why your 
father didn't go ahead and raise a 
lot of them." 

"It's this way," the stranger answered, "The Liver-Lipped Elephant Hound was not a mongrel or 
a mere crossbreed. It was a true 
hybrid dog and could not reproduce 
itself. You know how it is with 
hybrid corn. You have to buy hybrid 
seed every year. You can't save your 
corn and plant it, because it is likely 
to revert back and show all sorts 
of characteristics from the parent 
stock. It was the same way with the 
Elephant Hound. 

"Father tried breeding the Elephant Hound to a female from the 
previous litter that had all the other 
characteristics excepting the keen 
nose of the true Elephant Hound. 
But the true Elephant Hound, at 
the peak of its development, could 
not reproduce itself. The pups reverted back, away back. The litter 
included a Russian wolf-hound, a 
Beagle, an Airdale, a Great Dane 
and a Pekinese. 

"It was a nuisance as well as a 
disappointment. Father used to get 
in a fist fight every time he tried to 
convince anyone that they all belonged to the same litter. If he 
hadn't been six feet four inches tall 
and weighed two hundred and forty 
pounds, all muscle, nobody ever 
would have believed him. 

"But it was a great shock to father. After twenty years, he had only 



110 



FANTASTIC UNIVKRSH 



one Elephant Hound, and it 
couldn't reproduce itself. And about 
that time the hot dog got loose and 
burned down half the kennels and 
the office. All the records were destroyed and my father knew that it 
might take him another twenty 
years, forty years, or forever to reproduce the true Elephant Hound. 
He gave the Elephant Hound to me, 
sold all his other dogs and, for a 
hobby, began crossing guppies with 
parakeets to produce a flying fish 
thai could talk. He thought they 
would make wonderful pets. 

"But, to get on with my story. 
I was tickled pink to own this wonderful dog, the only one of its kind 
in the world, with the keenest nose 
of any dog that ever lived — and the 
longest. First thing, I took him on 
a hike through the woods. Like most 
dogs, he ran ahead of me. But he 
was different. He ran straight ahead 
and always took every turn just before I look it. 

"I decided I was following a natural path and he was trailing someone who had been that way recently. 
He led me to a neighboring farm 
where a new family had moved in 
the day before. The farmer had 
four beautiful daughters. Three 
weeks later I married the youngest 
— my wife." 

He nodded toward the car. 

"We took the Elephant Hound 
everywhere we went," he continued. 
"I thought it brought me luck. My 
wife didn't take to the animal and 
mumbled something about it being 
too smart for its own good. But I 



tfaough) that was just a woman's 
whim, until tilings began to happen 
that made me a little uneasy. The 
animal accompanied me everywhere, 
but it never trotted at my heels like 
other dogs do. It always trotted 
along about two yards ahead of me, 
its nose to the ground. I simply 
could not understand how it was 
able to anticipate every turn that I 
made and always arrive wherever I 
was going about six feet ahead of 
nic without ever so much as looking 
back. 

"A small matter, you may say, 
but it began to weigh on my mind. 
I will not bore you with all the 
stratagems I attempted in a vain 
effort to lose the Elephant Hound 
or elude it for even a moment. Suffice it to say I shall never forget 
llic day our first child was born. I 
rushed my wife to the hospital, 
leaving the Elephant Hound behind. But when I got to the hospital it was sitting there at the 
ambulance entrance, wagging its 
tail. It had taken a short cut across 
the fields, through the railroad 
yard* and into town. 

"The sight of it infuriated me. I 
kicked at it, but it dodged around 
the corner. The next day, when I 
went to buy some cigars, it was 
waiting in front of the tobacco 
store. I lacked at it again and it ran 
behind some parked cars. When I 
went down to die barber shop to 
hand out some cigars to the boys, it 
was waiting by the barber pole, I 
gave up and walked home, feeling 
very gloomy, with the Elephant 



THE ELEPHANT HOUND 



Hound trotting two yards ahead of 
me. 

"Is it possible, I asked myself, 
that this dog's nose is so keen it can 
trail me where I'm going instead of 
where I have been?" 

"A ridiculous idea if I ever heard 
one!" exclaimed Bob Pearce. 

-"Isn't it, though?" agreed the 
Stranger. "But thinking how ridiculous it was didn't ease my mind a 
bit, with the Elephant Hound trotting along six feet ahead of me all 
the time, It was- my wife who put 
into words what I was thinking. 

** 'Are you following that dog,' 
she asked one day, " 'or is it following you? Who's leading who 
around here, anyway?' 

"It was an unanswerable question. It was ridiculous to suggest 
that I was following the dog. Yet, 
it always got there first. I began to 
brood about it. Everything came to 
a head while we were on vacation 
out West. I went for a stroll, the 
Elephant Hound trotting ahead of 
me. We. climbed a small mountain 
and finally came to the edge of a 
cliff that overhung a canyon with a 
river at the bottom, hundreds of 
feet below. The Elephant Hound 
trotted to the edge of the precipice, 
lifted its head, and gave the longest, 
most mournful howl that I ever had 
heard 

"My blood ran cold. This is the 
end ! I thought. Here's where I walk 
to the edge of that precipice and 
fall into the river. My heart was 
like lead. I thought of my wife and 
children, waiting at the camp to 



1 1 1 

which I never would return alive. 
Tears started into my eyes. Then 
inspiration struck me. I hurled myself at the dog, widi a desperate 
leap, and pushed him over the edge 
of the precipice ! 

"I strolled back to camp, whistling and feeling lighter of heart 
than I had felt for years. 

"The Elephant Hound was waiting for me, dripping water and 
wagging his tail. 

"He had howled not because I 
was going to fall into the river, but 
because I was going to push him in ! 
I was in despair. I thought of going 
back and jumping off myself, just to 
prove him wrong. I thought of 
shooting him, but realized that that 
would be a confession I was losing 
my mind. And I remembered the 
twenty years my father had spent 
breeding this frightful animal, the 
only one of its kind in the world. 

"After we got home, another 
thought occurred to me. If I could 
not get ahead of him and lose him 
that way, maybe I could lose him by 
making him get so far ahead of me 
that I never would see him again. 
I would get rid of him that way. 
About every ten steps, as we walked 
down the street, I would take a long 
step and give' him a good kick. He 
would howl and trot a few yards 
ahead until I caught up and kicked 
him again. The neighbors had me 
in court, but I paid my fine and 
went about my business of kicking 
the Elephant Hound. 

"He caught on and began to stay 
about thirty feet ahead of me. I was 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



1 12 

making progress. I bought a powerful air gun and about every ten 
steps I would let him have a pellet 
where it did the most good. He'd 
howl and run ten blocks. After 
three days of that, he got the idea. 
I let him have about six shot in 
rapid succession and he vanished in 
the distance. That was several yean 

"I never saw him again. At last I 
was free! You have no idea what a 
relief it was to me to know that 1 
did not have to go through life two 
paces behind that infernal, hideous 
beast with its incredible nose! 
You've no remotest idea!" 

We all sat silent for a while, just 
looking at one another. Then Dave 
spoke: "3y the way, Mr. Brcdd, 
just what did that Elephant Hound 
look like?" 

The stranger hesitated a minute 
and looked at us very closely. 
"Well, he was a great big old liverlippcd hound, about as big as a 
calf and bony looking. He had short 
gray luir with blue spots, brown 
spots and red spots and a black spot 
over cadb eye. His nose was nearly 
an inch longer than any other dog's 
nose." 

While he was describing the dor 
he turned a little pale and beads of 
perspiration popped out all over his 
face, his neck, his arms and the back 
of his hands. He looked all around, 
moving his eyes but not his head. 

"Why r gasped Bob Pearce. 
"Why, it's under the — " And lie 
clapped his hand over his moulh. 
The idea was too ridiculous. 



"What's that?" demanded the 
stranger, in a high, sharp voice. 

"It's under — it's the strangest 
dog under the sun!" cried Bob. 

The stranger said not another 
word. He covered the distance to 
his car in three steps, slammed the 
door, and shot awav with the rear 
wheels spinning. 

"That's it!" said Bob at last. "It's 
under the verandah right now ! Let's 
catch it! I don't care how that fellow feels about it! I sure would like 
to own that dog f 

All together, we jumped off the 
verandah. But the moment our feet 
hit the ground, a gray streak shot 
out from under the store, knocked 
Dave flat in his back, split the dust 
across the Cool Creek road, and 
arched over the fence into the 
woods. The rest of us just stood 
there looking foolish, 

"I wonder where he's headed," 
said Abncr Wheat. 

"I don't know," answered Bob. 
"But if he goes right through the 
swamp, he'll be in the next town 
before that fellow in the car is." 

Dave got up and dusted himself. 
"Oh, that's a lot of foolishness, the 
story that fellow told," he grumbled. "All I wanted to do was get 
that big ugly dog out from under 
my store. I don't like stray dogs." 

"That's right," agreed Bob. "He 
might have died there and you'd 
have had to go under there and 
drag him out. I'm glad we chased 
him off." 

But he and Dave stood there 
about ten minutes, watching the

by... Hans Stefan Santesson 



The former editor of a famous 
book club conducts a lively survey 
of science fiction in hard covers. 



\ hundred and sixty years ago, 
young Jesse Appleton was writing to 
his cousin in Keene, N. H.: 

"In little more than a fortnight I 
am to leave College, and launch out 
into a world as ignorant for the 
most part as myself. But what shall 
I do? Shall I attempt to get my 
living at the Bar (as a lawyer) already crowded with wise men and 
fools? Or shall three or four years 
of my time be spent in the study of 
physics (truly a laudable study) and 
then be denied an opportunity of 
exercising my skill ? Or shall 1 
rather join brother Wooley, alias 
Woolcye, and dispense the everlasting gospel? Which of these will 
be my favorite is uncertain . . ." 

Ambitious, truly, was Jesse Appleton, writing at a time when the 
"eastern and southern mail are 
brought here weekly, the former On 
horseback, the latter in the stage," I 
quote him in the hope of. reassuring 
those of you who may have felt that 
August, 1792, was a long, long time 
ago, and that somehow people were 
different in those days. Of course it 
was a long time ago, and still it 
isn't — measuring time in the terms 
with which we are familiar. But it

is important to remember that those 
men and Chose women who lived 
and dreamed to make something 
of the group of scattered and barely 
united colonies that were to become 
the United States were very much 
like you who read this magazine 
today. 

These men and women were 
often patriots, and equally as often 
scoundrels. They were men and 
women with the emotions and impulses of flesh-and-blood people, 
and any novel or any history that 
does not get this across, or which 
describes them simply as noble 
selfless posturing characters (never 
chasing a blonde of course!) completely fails to bring those times to 
life! 

But what does all this have to do 
witli Science Fiction? 
Plenty. 

Science fiction demands something more of its readers than a 
blind belief in the eventual triumph 
of unfettered gadgctry, and demands more than the glib certainty 
that we will go off, a million or a 
thousand or ten years from now, on 
sometimes rather badly pre-fabricated and unconvincing tangents 
— socio-political and well-meaning. 
Some writers, ignoring the lessons 
of the past hundred and sixty years 
and fascinated by machines— without necessarily understanding them 
— have also assumed that- we will 
mature, machine-wise, but remain 
the same "characters * we arc today 
with our group complexes and 
prejudices "showing." 



I suggested, at New Orleans and 
Chicago, that this didn't make sense. 

Let me illustrate. 

Group A doesn't like Group B. 

Group B returns '.he compliment. 

If you're a social scientist — a 
fancy word which just means you 
try to understand what makes people tick— you can often find tlje reason why Group A doesn't like 
Group B, or why Group B — 
if taken over in the corner — 
has been known to have its 
own opinion about the people in 
Group A. The reasons, locally or 
on a global scale, will be varied. 
But they can usually be identified as 
part and parcel of the times in 
which we all live. The reasons in 
1792 were thus and thus; in 1955 
they have new motivations. Remove 
the reason for the mistrust — remove the specific reasons for Group 
A's mistrust of Group B— and 
you've sometimes got a case of "boy 
meets girl." 

What I don't understand, however, is the bland assumption that 
we will carry with us into the 
golden, streamlined, multiple-galaxied Tomorrows the fears, hatreds, 
and suspicions which are a part of 
our own times. Are we only going 
to half grow up? With the causes 
removed, are the diseases still to 
persist? 

But I've strayed off on a tangent. 

Science fiction, as a field, demands more from its readers than 
blind — or bland — acceptance of any 
random corn dished out under the 



Il6 FANTASTIC 

all-inclusive label. Speculative and 
scientific science fiction, to distinguish it from certain other variants 
■ — remember when Mickey Spillane 
discovered SF? — demands wider 
reading, solider reading. Sit down 
with Sprague de Camp sometimes 
(I hope you have his lost continents, 1954, Gnome Press), with 
writers like Fletcher Pratt, Willy 
Ley, Theodore Sturgeon and still 
others. Historians, scientists, thinkers—these are the men who, more 
than some of you readers may realize, have added stature and dignity 
to the field. 

Basil Davenport's excellent 

INQUIRY INTO SCIENCE FICTION 

(Longmans, Green and Co.) , is 
therefore doubly recommended reading. A survey of principally modern SF, Davenport's inquiry discusses both scientific and speculative 
science fiction, Science Fiction and 
the Emotions, "Space Operas, Mad 
Scientists, and Bug-Eyed Monsters," 
and "The Future of Science Fiction." 

The author points out that "We 
live in a world where nothing is 
. certain except change; but we can 
try to imagine the effects of certain 
changes and whether or not we like 
them, and then can even perhaps 
try to work for or against them." 

"Man and society are of course 
so closely connected that a change 
in the -character of either one must 
lead to a corresponding change in 
the other," Davenport writes, discussing present-day authors "more 



UNIVERSE 

given to social extrapolation" and 
the attitude of writers in Scientific 
Science Fiction, willing "to entertain any hypothesis, combined with 
an insistence on logic and on verification if possible." The contrast 
between "the natural equalitariariism of most scientists" and the 
"chauvinism of Earth in the space 
opera," is brought out. 
Summing up, he writes: 
"This fantasy fiction, and the science fiction that is fantasy in all but 
name, are already giving us the 
myths of our generation. A myth 
may be defined as a story which contains a truth, not in the manner of a 
fable, which illustrates a truth by 
anecdote, nor in the manner of an 
allegory, which translates a truth 
into other terms, but in the very 
nature of the story itself. In the 
great myths, like Baldur and the 
Mistletoe or Kafka's The Castle or 
Stapledon's Lttst and First Men, no 
sort of translation is possible. You 
feel an inner meaning, but it cannot be expressed in other terms than 
in those of the story itself." 

"Myths today are being written 
in this form of imaginative writing. 
In discussing R. U. R. I tried to 
show how many myths it recalls or 
re-states. The same thing is true 
with all the deepest science fiction.

cration or two. It is science fiction 
which is telling them to us now." 

Read Davenport's inquiry into 
science fiction! Better still — buy 
it! Jimmy Taurasf's excellent "Fantasy Times" commented on what it 
felt was the high price of the book. 
My advice to you is to make sure 
your library has it— and if not, why 
not t Read it as soon as you can and 
then go down to your local bookstore, or still better, write to the 
publishers, putting down the two 
and a half dollars the publishers 
have to ask for the book. Yes — 
have to ask ! Printing and production costs, plus a small printing, 
made that price necessary. But Davenport's inquiry into science 
fiction is a "must" in any comprehensive library of SF! 

Cyril M. Kornbluth's able not 
this august (Doublcday) and 
Jerry Sohl's somewhat less able 
point ultimate (Rinehart), published within months of each other, 
represent an interesting plot departure in the field. The appearance of 
two novels, so closely together, describing what could happen in the 
event of our surrender to Communism, perhaps represents a trend 
and certainly represents SF's willingness to, as Davenport puts it, 
"plot the carve that will be traced 
if some tendency in our present society increases to its logical extreme-" Where Kornbluth and Sohl 
do differ is in the effectiveness of 
their portraits of Occupied America. And neither novel is perhaps 



in books 117 

science fiction in the Campbellian 
sense of the word. 

Jerry Sohl's hungry and grim Occupied United States of 1999, thirty 
years after the enemy H-bombs had 
wiped out Washington and Chicago, is vividly drawn, as are his 
Director Alfred Gniessin, collaborationist Tisdail, and others. Emmet 
Keys, of Spring Creek, Illinois, may 
not be the most convincing hero of 
the year, but he makes an interesting contribution to the resistance 
movement. For further details, read 
point ultimate! 

Kornbluth, co-author with Fred-" 
erik Pohl of the important THE 
space merchants (Ballantine) 
and of gladiator-at-law (Ballantine), discussed last month, describes an Occupied United States 
in 1965, the territory East of the 
Mississippi under Soviet Military 
Government and the states West of 
the Mississippi administered by the 
Chinese. Gribble, Justin, Sparhawk. 
Betsy, Hollerith, Fein Watt and the 
rest, are live people. They don't 
posture. There are no mildly unconvincing heroics. These are normal and quite credible people, faced 
by the collapse of everything that 
has meant so much to them throughout their lives, reacting the way 
they would act, fighting the way 
they would fight, and dying as they 
would die! not this august is 
definitely recommended. 

Remember Wilson Tucker's excellent the long loud silence 
(1952, Rinehart) ? Rinehart has

just brought out another Wilson

the .search for the man or men, 
from the present or from the future, 
who had an unfortunate habit of 
bombing into nothingness the leaders of a certain Senator's jingoistic 
"Sons of America" party. Lieutenant Dan forth of the bomb s<|uad, 
Illinois Security Police, and Telepath Police Official Ramsey collaborate in the hunt for the man or men, 
from just around the corner or perhaps from the day after tomorrow, 
who don't appreciate "Ben's Boys." 
The role that Gilgamesh plays in all 
this is pure Tucker. Recommended. 

The witty, the urbane, and sometimes overly civilized Dr. Lin Yutang, explores an escape from a 
rather dreary Tomorrow in his 
LOOKING BEYOND (Prentice Hall). 

The world of 2004 is a world 
where they build buildings "underground, thirty floors below" in the 
effort to "escape atom bombs. A 
complete underground city, with elevators and streets and all that." 
They've also tried to grow gardens 
underground, "but not very successfully." Despite artificial sunlight and all sorts of chemical fertilizer fluids, "it's never quite the 



same." The flowers don't cooperate .. . Barbara Maverick's world 
is one where "there is much more 
pasture land available since most 
buildings arc built underground. A 
few people refuse stubbornly to go 
under. But everything is so much 
more convenient with modern inventions and facilities" down among 
the people with the "subterranean 
outlook." 

People do come up to the ground 
surface sometimes, "for a stroll or a 
whiff of fresh air," but "things are 
apt to be a little seedy-looking on 
the surface, with long stretches of 
country, and not a house in sight." 

This is partly the world which 
Barbara Maverick, of the Geodetic 
Survey, Division of World Food 
and Health, Democratic World 
Commonwealth, turns her back on 
forever when she stumbles on the 
island colony, established by Laos, 
who'd found others who agreed 
with him that "we may not disobey 
the laws of Nature with impunity." 
The colony was a sophisticated 
Hellenist's answer to the threatened 
collapse of a civilization lie felt had 
tun amuck. 

Recommended — to those of you 
who may sometimes agree with 
Laos.

A rather introspective young 
donkey startled bis father by saying, 
' Why, yes, I'm sure it could be

"What can be done, son?" 

"Getting away with the lion's

we could fool them now." 

"What make* you think that, 
pray?" asked his father. "Once bitten, twice shy, should be the lesson 
we asses should draw from that 
earlier experience." 

"He wasn't bitten," said the 
young ass scornfully. "He was beaten. He brayed and people knew he 
wasn't a lion. They belted him with 
sticks." 

"Beaten or bitten, it was painful 
enough," said the father. 

Undeterred, the young ass procured a lion's skin. He put it on 
and trotted up and down. . 

"Fine feathers!" scoffed the 
father. 

"Fur!'" said the young ass, curling his lip. 

"Feathers or- fur!" said the old 
ass. "Now, let us hear your roar!"

confidently anticipated a full-blooded lion roar thundered forth. The 
old ass was so startled he sat down 
hard on his stern and blinked iiis 
eyes for half a minute before gasping: "It was a roar!" 

"Why not?" said the young ass, 
lightly, "It pays to advertise but you 
r.ust deliver the goods." 

The old ass thought of countering with, "Empty vessels make the 
most sound," but curiosity got the 
better of him; So he swallowed his 
words and asked instead: "But I 
can't understand how you were able 
ta roar?." 

"New days, new ways," said the 
young ass. "I've been studying 
lions." He roared again. "No lion 
could do better." 

"Pride goes before a fall," said 
I he old ass. 

"Sweet grass tastes like docks in 
the mouths of the old," said the 
young ass. "Never venture, never 
win." 

"The proof of the hay is in the 
eating," said the father. "Let us 
have more deeds and fewer words." 

The young ass set off for the 
nearest village. On its outskirts he 
iTiet a dog. Instead of running away, 
the dog eyed the ass idly. 

"Why don't you run?" asked the 
ass. 

"Why should I?" asked the dog, 
boredly. "If you had come up roaring then it would have been correct 
lo run. Besides, how am I to know 
you aren't an ass in a lion's skin? It 
has happened before, you know." 

"This is how you know," said the 



young ass and opened his mouth 
and roared. 

"Okay, okay, you're a lion," said 
the dog and look to his heels. 

He went only a quarter of a mile. 
He sat up, scratched himself and 
ruminated, "It was as well to be 
cautious. But I'm positive that was 
no lion but an ass in a lion skin. I'll 
go and tell my master." 

The dog ran fast and met his 
master. "Master, diere's a silly ass 
back there masquerading as a lion," 
said the dog. "Get your stick." 

"That 1 will," said the dog's 
master. "I'll beat the impudent fellow for trying to deceive people 
with such a stale trick." 

The master and the dog had gone" 
only a little way when the ass came 
trotting along the road, roaring. 

"iMy fine ass, you'll soon feel the 
weight of my stick!" cried the villager and ran forward. 

"And my teeth!" cried the dog. 
The man swung his stick. The ass 
opened his mouth wide, roared 
loudly, and bit the man hard on the 
arm. The man yelled with the pain 
and dropped his stick. 

The villager fled. He ran very 
hard for half a mile, with die dog 
following, before he stopped. 

"What did you run for, master?" 
asked the dog. "It was only an ass." 

"That may well be," said the villager. "But lie bit like a lion." 

"But I can prove it was an ass if 
you'll allow me a few words," said 
the dog. 

"Deeds are what count," said the 
master and began to beat the dog.

It was the loveliest flower Miss 
Fray had ever seen. And it brought 
with it a promise of peace on 
Earth — and a brighter tomorrow. 



Not Miss Felicity Fray. 

Let others j erk awake to an 
alarm, scramble f rom bed, scrub 
away the clinging patina of sleep 
with a face-flannel, hunt out the 
day's clothes, watch the percolator 
impatiently, urge the toast to pop 
up more quickly. Let them chew 
briskly, swallow pulpily, and hurry, 
arms and legs reciprocating briskly, 
on their ways. 

Let these automata, with batteries 
regenerated, respond with spry efficiency to (he insistent eye of the 
new day's sun, and let them greet 
the morning with resolution in heel

eye, and set off to make their new 
deals, new conquests . . . 

But not Felicity Fray. 

For today is part of yesterday. 
And yesterday and today are parts 
of being alive. And being alive is 
not just an affair of the days going 
clonk-donk-clonk like the pendulum of a grandfather clock. Being 
alive is something continuous that 
does not repeat, something that one 
should be aware of all the time, 
sleeping and waking. 

It may not last much longer. 



John Wyndham, whose triffids have established themselves m the popular 
imagination as quite the jnost hideous entities in pre tent -day science

And if you were to meet Aiiss Felicity Fray on a quiet English lane tomorrow we're sure you'd recognize her, for the richly poetic quality of Mr.

FANTASTIC UNIVCRSfi 



There is no savor in hurry; so 
Miss Fray did not hurry; she did 
not jerk or bounce into the beginning of her day. About dawn she 
started to drift from dream through 
half-dream to day-dream, and lay 
umnoving, listening to the birds, 
watching the sky lighten, becoming 
aware of the day as it became aware 
of itself. 

For more than an hour she lay 
Covering this and that side of the 
misty edge of sleep. Sometimes the 
sounds in her ears were real birds 
singing, sometimes they were remembered voices speaking. She enjoyed them both, smiling in her 
half-sleep. 

By tlie time the day began to win 
her certainly from the night the 
birds were almost silent. They had 
done with the greeting, and started 
on the business of looking for food. 
She was quite abruptly aware that 
the world was almost noiseless. 

There was an alarming feeling of 
unreality. She held her breath to 
listen for some reassuring sound. 
Supposing it had all slopped, now 
■ — as it might do one day? 

Perhaps, even at this moment, 
there were in some parts of the 
world great columns of smoke 
writhing upwards in Medusan coils, 
swelling out at the top into cerebral 
convolutions that pulsed with a 
kind of sub-life, marking the beginning of the silence that meant the 
end of everything. 

For years now, when she was off 
her guard, those pillars of smoke 
iud been likely to start up in her 



mind. She hated and feared them. 
They were the triumphant symbol 

of Science. 

Science was, perhaps, wonderful, 
but, for Miss Fray, it was a wonder 
of the left hand. Science was the 
enemy of the world that lived and 
breathed. It was a crystalline formation on the harsh naked rock of 
brain, mindless, insensitive, barren, 
yet actively a threat, an alien threat 
that she feared as un-understandingly as an animal fears fire. Science, the great anti-bEotic. 

So Felicity listened unhappily. 

A bird called, and was answered. 

That was not enough. 

She went on listening for more 
reassurance. 

In the farmyard several fields 
away, a tractor coughed, stuttered, 
and then ran more steadily, warming up. 

She relaxed, relieved to be sure 
that the world was still alive. Then 
she faintly frowned her ungrateful 
contempt for the tractor, and pushed 
it out of her consciousness. 

It, too, was a manifestation of 
science, and unwelcome. 

She withdrew among her 
thoughts. She resurrected stored moments and magical glimpses, and 
remembered golden words. She 
landscaped her own Arcady which 
knew no Science. 

The tractor throbbed more briskly as it trundled out of the yard, 
die sound of it diminishing to a 
purr as it crossed the fields, unheard 
by Felicity. 

There was plenty of time. 



v/n.n 

Enough to take the field-path way 
to school, and not to hurry over it. 

The siin was fiifnptng, a medallion pinned on a deepening blue 
doak. Later on, the day would be 
hot, but now it was fresh, with a 
touch like a tool, white-fingered 
hand. Refractile gems still trembled 
on the leaves and stalks. 

Beads from the shaken grass ran 
down her legs, showered on the 
white canvas shoes, fell like kisses 
on her feet. 

Cows, coming out from the sheds 
with their udders relieved, but still 
slow and patient, stared at her with 
incurious curiosity, and then turned 
away to tear the grass, and munch 
in thoughtless rumination. 

A lark, high up, trilled to mislead her from its nest, and a young 
blackbird, looking puffy and overfed, eyed her cautiously from the 
hedge. 

A light draught of summer wind 
blew through her cotton frock, caressing her with cobweb fingers. 

Then there was a muttering in 
the sky; then a roaring that rumbled 
back and foith in the vault; then a 
shrieking over her head, a battering 
at I he ears and the senses, not fo be 
shut out. The present assaulting 
her, bawling unignorably, frighteningly through its jet-mouths. Science on the wing. 

Felicity put her hands to her ears 
and rocked her head. The' outrage 
hurtled close above, sound-waves 
clashing together, buffeting, and 
reeling back. 

IE passed, and she uncovered her 



ears again. With tears in her eyes 
she shook her fist at the fleeing 
shriek of the jets and all they represented, while the air still shuddered 
about her. 

The" cows continued f o graze. 

How comfortable to be' a cow. 
Neither expecting nor regretting; 
having no sense of guilt, nor need 
for it. Making no distinctions between the desirable and undesirable 
works of men; able to flick them, 
like the fhe-;, aside with the swish 
of a tow-ended tail. 

The shriek and the rumble died 
in the distance. The shattered scene 
began to reintegrate behind it, still 
for a while bloom-brushed and 
bruised, but slowly healing. 

One day there would be too much 
bruising; too much to recover from. 

"Intimations of mortality," said 
Miss Fray, to herself. "So .nvny 
little deaths before the biij; one. 
How silly 1 am to suffer. Why 
should I feel all these pangs of 
guilt for other people? 1 arn not iesponsible for this. I am not even 
much afraid for myself. Why do I 
have to be so hurt by fear for all and 
everything?" 

A thrush sang in the spinney beyond the hedge. 

She paused to listen. 

Unguent:, sweet notes they were. 

She walked on, becoming aware 
again of the silk-fringed zephyrs on 
her cheeks, the sun on her ams, the 
dew on her feet. 

As Felicity opened the door the 
hive-murmur beyond sank into silence.

FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



The rows of pink-cheeked faces 
framed in long hair, short hair, 
plaits, some of it morning-tidy, 
some of it already waywrdly awry, 
were all turned towards her. The 
bright eyes were all fixed on her 
face. 

"Good morning. Miss Tray," they 
all said, in unison, and silence fell 
is completely as before. 

She could feel the suppressed expectation in the air as they watched 
her. There was something she must 
respond to. She looked for it. Her 
glance went round the familiar 
room until it reached her desk. 
There it stopped, where ft small 
glass vase held a single flower. 

The rows of eyei switched from 
her to the desk, and then back 
again. She walked slowly across and 
sat down in her chair, her gaze 
never leaving the strangely beautiful bloom. 

It was something she had never 
seen before. She was quite unable to 
classify it, and she looked at it for a 
long time. 

It was more complex than the 
simpler field flowers, yet not 
sophisticated. The colors were clear, 
but not primaries. The shape was 
comely, but without garden-bred 
formality. The ground-color of the 
petals was a pale pink, flushing a 
little at the over-rolled edges, paling to cream further bode Then 
there was the flush-color again, 
powder-stippled at first, then reticulated, then solid as it narrowed into 
the trumpet, but split by white 
spurs of the center veins. 



There was just a suggestion of 
orchis about it, perhaps, but it was 
no kind of orchis she had ever seen, 
alive or pictured. The petal curves 
were sweet natural roundings, like 
limbs, or water cascading, or saplings bent in the wind. The texture 
was depthlessly soft. 

Felicity leaned closer, gazing inLo 
the velvet throat. Little crescentshaped stamens faintly dusted with 
pollen trembled on green, hair-like 
stalks. She caught the scent of it. A 
little sweetness, a little sharpness, a 
little earthiness, blended with a 
subtlety to make a perfumer's art 
vulgar and banal. 

She breathed in the scent again, 
and looked into the flower hypnotized, unable to take her eyes from 
it, loving it in its brave delicacy 
with a sweet, longing compassion. 

She had forgotten the room, the 
eyes that watched her, everything 
but the flower itself. 

A fidgeting somewhere brought 
her back. She lifted her head, and 
looked unhurriedly along the rows 
of faces. 

"Thank you," she said. "It's a 
beautiful flower. What is it?" 
Seemingly, no one knew. 
"Who brought it?" Felicity asked 
them. 

A small, golden-headed child in 
the middle of the second row pinked a little. 

"I did, Miss Fray." 

"And you don't know what it is, 
Marielle?" 

"No, Miss Fray. I just found it, 
and I thought it was pretty, ind t 



WILD FLOWER 



[35 



thought you'd like it," she explained, a trifle anxiously. 

Felicity looked back to the flower 
again. "I do like it, Marielle. It's 
lovely. It was very kind of you to 
think of bringing it for me." 

She loitered over the flower a few 
seconds more, and then moved the 
vase decisively to the left of the 
desk. With an effort she turned her 
r yes away from it, back to the rows 
of faces. 

"One day," she said, "I'll read 
you some William Blake — "To see 
a World in a Grain of Sand, And a 
Heaven in a Wild Flower . . .' But 
now we must get on, we've wasted 
too much time already. I want you 
to copy out what I write on the 
board, in your best handwriting." 

She picked up the chalk and 
(bought for a moment, looking at 
the flower. Then she went ever to 
the blackboard, and wrote: "Their 
colors and their forms, were then 
to me an appetite; a feeling and a 
love . . ." 

"Marielle. Just a moment," Felicity said. 

The child paused and turned back 
as the others streamed out of the 
room. 

"Thank you very much for bringing it. Was it the only one?" Felicity asked her. 

"Oh, no, Miss Fray. There were 
three or four clumps of them." 

"Where, Marielle? I'd like to get 
a root of it, if I can." 

"On Mr. Hawkes's farm. In the 
top comer of the big field, where 



the long bright ship from the sky 
aashed," the child told her. 

"Where the airplane crashed,** 
Felicity repeated. 

"Yes, Miss Fray." 

Felicity sat down slowly, staring 
at the flower. The child waited, and 
shifted from one foot to the other. 

"Please, may I go now, Miss 
Fray?" 

"Yes," said Felicity, without 
looking up. "Yes, of course." 

Feet scuttered out of the room. 

Felicity -went on looking at the 
flower. 

"Where the ship from the sky 
crashed." That had been almost a 
year ago — on a summer's evening 
when all die world was quietening 
and settling down for the night. 
'Now fades the glimmering landscape on (he sight, and all the air a 
solemn stillness holds.' Then the 
airplane, wheeling its droning 
flight, destroying the peace. 

It was a silver-paper cross up in 
the sky where the sunlight was still 
bright. Unusually, Felicity looked 
up. She tried to ignore the noise 
and her prejudices, for the craft 
had, undeniably, a silver-moth 
beauty of its own. 

She watched it turn, the sunset 
glistering the undersides of the 
wings as it tilted. Then, suddenly, 
amid the silver there had been a 
flash of rose-red fire, and the silver 
moth ceased to exist. Pieces of glittering foil were spreading apart and 
falling. The largest piece trailed 
smoke above it, like a black funeral 
plume. 



FANTASTIC UNIVERSE 



A great crack slapped at her ears. 
The pieces twisted and flashed in 
the sky as they came, some fast, 
some slower. The biggest of all 
seemed to be falling straight towards her. Perhaps she screamed. 
She threw herself on the ground, 
arms clutched over her head and 
ears, willing to sink herself into die 
earth itself. 

There were interminable secondfractions of waiting while the silver 
wreckage came hurtling down the 
sky, and Felicity and all the world 
about her held their breath. 

The solid ground bounced under 
her. Then came the crash, and the 
shrieking of metal. 

Felicity looked up, biting fearfully on her hand. 

She saw the silver body, a crumpled fish-shape, less than a hundred 
yards away, and in that moment 
petals of flame blossomed round it. 

Something else fell close by. 

She cringed dose to the earth 
again. 

Something in the main body blew 
up. Bits of metal whirred like 
pheasants over her, and plopped 
around. 

Presently she risked raising her 
bead again. The wreck was a cone 
of fame with black smoke above. 
She could feel the warmth on her 
face. She did not dare to stand up 
lest something else should explode 
and send jagged metal fragments 
slicing into her. 

She had been still there, clinging 
to the earth and crying, when the 
crash-parties arrived and found her. 



Shock, they had said, shock and 
fright They had treated her for 
that, and then sent her home. 

She had cried for the destruction, 
for the fire and smoke, the noise 
and confusion of it. And she had 
cried too, for the people who had 
died in it, for the wanton futility of 
it 

They kept her in bed a few days, 
with instructions to rest and reiajc, 
But it was difficult to relax when 
things kept on going round and 
round in one's head. 

"Oh, God," she prayed, "won't 
You stop them? It isn't their world 
to do as they like with. It's Your 
world, and mine — the heart's world 
that they are destroying with their 
mind's world. Please, God, while 
there is still time. You destroyed 
their presumption at Babel, won't 
You do it again, before it's too 
late?" 

Felicity remembered the prayer 
as she sat at her desk, looking at the 
beautiful flower. 

They had put a fence round the 
place where the airplane had crashed, and set guards, too, to keep people away. Inside it, men in overall 
suits prowled and prowled, seardiing,, listening, watching counters. 

Cobalt was the trouble, they said. 
She had wondered how that could 
be. But it was not die artist's cobalt 
they wanted. The scientists had 
taken even tire deep blue color of 
the sea, and had done something 
deadly to that, too, it appeared. 

Though not altogether, not necessarily, deadly, Miss Sunpsoa who 



WILD FLOWER 



taught science at the High School 
had explained to her. The airplane 
h.id been carrying some radio-active 
cobalt intended for a hospital somewhere in the Middle East. In the 
crash, or perhaps in the first explosion, the lead box that kept it safe 
had been broken open. It was extremely dangerous, and bad to be 
recovered, 

"How ? Dangerous ?*" Felicity 
had wanted to know. 

And Miss Simpson had told her 
something of the effects of gamma 
rays on living matter. 

Several weeks had passed before 
the searching men were completely 
satisfied, and went away. They had 
left the fence, no longer guarded, 
simply as a mark to indicate the 
piece of ground that was not to be 
ploughed this season. The ground 
had been left free to grow what it 
would. 

And out of the noise, the destruction, the fire, the deadly radiations, 
had sprung the lovely flower. 

Felicity went on looking at the 
flower for a long time in the silent 
room. Then she raised her eyes, and 
glanced along the rows of desks 
where the bright faces had been. 

"I see," she said, to the emptiness and the unseen. "I am weak. 
I have had too little faith," 

She had a disinclination to revisit 
the site of the crash alone. She 
asked Mariclle to come with her on 
Saturday and show her where the 
fiowcrs grew. 

They climbed by a cool path 
through the woods, crossed a stile 



127 

and the pasture beyond it. When 

they came to the enclosure, its feme 
already pushed flat in several places, 
they found a man already within it. 
He wore a shirt and blue jeans, and 
was engaged in unslinging a heavy 
cylinder from his back, 

He laid the thing carefully on the 
ground and pulled out a larj^e spotted handkerchief to wipe his face 
and neck. He turned as they approached, and grinned amiably. 
Felicity recognized him as the farmer's second son. 

"It's hot work carrying three or 
four gallons on your back this 
weather," he explained apologetically, wiping the handkerchief 
down his arms so that the golden 
hairs stood up and glinted in the 
sunlight. 

Felicity looked at the ground. 
There were five or six small clumps 
of the flowers growing in the weeds 
and grass, one of them half-crushed 
under the cylinder. 

"Oh," said Marielle, in distress. 
"You've been killing them — killing 
the flowers. They're what we came 
for." 

"You can pick 'em, and welcome," he told her. 

"But we wanted some roots, to 
gtow them," Mariclle told him 
woefully. She turned to Felicity unhappily. "They're such pretty (lowers, too." 

"Pretty enough," agreed the man, 
looking down at them. "But there 
it is. On't have this lot seeding all 
over the rest, you see." 

"You've poisoned them all — 



FANTASTIC UNIVERS-B 



every one?" Marielle asked miserably. 

The man nodded. "I'm afraid 
they're done for now, for all they 
still look ail right. If you had let 
me know . . . But it's too late now. 
But they'll do you no harm to pick," 
he explained. "It isn't poison in the 
old way, you see. Something to do 
with hormones, whatever they are. 
Doesn't knock 'em out. is you might 
say. It just sends 'em all wrong in 
the growing so they- give up. Wonderful what the scientific chaps get 
hold of these days. Never know 
what they'll hring out next, do 
you ?'* 

Felicity and Marielle gathered 
little bunches of the doomed flowers. They still looked as delicately 
beautiful and still had their poignant scent At the stile Marielle stopped and stood looking sadly at her 
little bunch. 

' ' They're so lovely," she said 
mournfully, with tears in her eyes. 

Felicity put an arm round her. 
"Tlicy are lovely," she agreed. 
"They're very lovely — ind they've 



gone. But the important thing is 
that they came. It was a gift to us 
from a wiser world. That's the wonderful thing. There'll he some more 
— some day — somewhere. We must 
never doubt it." 

A jet came shrieking suddenly, 
close over the hilltop. Marielle put 
her hands over her ears. Felicity 
stood watching the machine shrink 
among the cream and tumble of 
protesting air, She held up her little 
posy of flowers to the blast. 

"This is your answer," she said. 
"This. You bullies, with your vast 
clubs of smoke — this is greater thaa 
all of you." 

Marielle took down her hands. 
"I bate them — I hate them," she 
said, her eyes on the vanishing 
speck. 

"I hate tli em, too," agreed Felicity. "But now I'm not afraid of 
them any more. 1 have found a remedy, an elixir: 

It is a wine of virtuous powers; 
My mother nude it of wild 
flowers."
