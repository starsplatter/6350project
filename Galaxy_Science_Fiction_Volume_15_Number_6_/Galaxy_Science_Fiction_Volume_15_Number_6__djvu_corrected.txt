THE SITTERS 

BY CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

If was their job to sit, so that wasn't the 
sinister part. Then what? They were sitting 
on a town . . . and the town was unaware of it!

THE first week of school was 
finished. Johnson Dean, su- 
perintendent of Millville 
High, sat at his desk, enjoying the 
quiet and the satisfaction of late 
Friday afternoon. 

The quiet was massacred by 
Coach Jerry Higgins. He clomped 
into the office and threw his mus- 
cular blond frame heavily in a 
chair. 

"Well, you can call off football 
for the year," he said angrily. "We 
can drop out of the conference." 
Dean pushed away the papers 
on which he had been working and 
leaned back in his chair. The sun- 
light from the western windows 
turned his silver thatch into a seem- 
ing halo. His pale, blue-veined, 
wrinkled hands smoothed out, 
painstakingly, the fading crease in 
his fading trousers. 



"What has happened now?" he 
asked. 

"It's King and Martin, Mr. 
Dean. They aren't coming out this 
year." 

Dean clucked sympathetically, 
but somewhat hollowly, as if his 
heart was not quite in it. "Let me 
see," he said. "If I remember right- 
ly, those two were very good last 
year. King was in the line and 
Martin quarterback." 

Higgins exploded in righteous 
indignation. "Who ever heard of 
a quarterback deciding he wouldn't 
play no more? And not just an 
ordinary boy, but one of the very 
best. He made all-conference last 
year." 

"YouVe talked to them, of 
course?" 

"I got down on my knees to 
them," said the coach. "I asked 




 



Garth 



and the visitor 

BY L J. STECHER 

If you could ask them, you might 
be greatly surprised—some tabus 
very urgently want to be broken! 

Illustrated by DICK FRANCIS 



ALTHOUGH as brash as 
any other ace newspaper 
reporter for a high school 
weekly — and there is no one 
brasher — Garth was scared. His 
head crest lifted spasmodically and 
the rudimentary webbing between 
his fingers twitched. To answer a 
dare, Garth was about to attempt 
something that had never been 
dared before: a newspaper inter- 
view with The Visitor. There had 
been questions enough asked and 
answered during the thousands of 
years The Visitor had sat in his 
egg-shaped palace on the moun- 



taintop, but no interviews. It was 
shocking even to think about — 
something like requesting a gos- 
sippy chat with God. 

Of course, nobody believed the 
fable any longer that The Visitor 
would vanish if he was ever asked 
a personal question — and that he 
would first destroy the man who 
asked. It was known, or at least 
suspected, that the Palace was 
merely a mile-long spaceship. 

Garth, as tradition required, 
climbed the seven-mile-long rock- 
hewn path to the Palace on foot. He 
paused for a moment on the broad 



GARTH AND THE VISITOR 



31 



platform at the top of the pyramid 
to catch his breath and let the 
beating of his heart slow to nor- 
mal after his long climb before 
he entered The Palace. He sighed 
deeply. The sufferings a reporter 
was willing to go through to get a 
story or take a dare! 

"Well, come in if you're going 
to," said an impatient voice. "Don't 
just stand there and pant." 

"Yes, my Lord Visitor," Garth 
managed to say. 

He climbed the short ladder, 
passed through the two sets of 
doors and entered a small room 
to kneel, with downcast eyes, be- 
fore the ancient figure huddled in 
the wheelchair. 

fT^HE Visitor looked at the 
-*- kneeling figure for a moment 
without speaking. The boy looked 
very much like a human, in spite 
of such superficial differences as 
crest and tail. In fact, as a smooth- 
skinned thinking biped, with a 
well-developed moral sense, he fit 
The Visitor's definition of a hu- 
man. It wasn't just the loneli- 
ness of seven thousand years of 
isolation, either. When he had 
first analyzed these people, just 
after that disastrous forced land- 
ing so long ago, he had classified 
them as human. Not homo sapiens, 
of course, but human all the same. 
"Okay," he said, somewhat 
querulously. "Get up, get up. 
You've got some questions for me, 



I hope? I don't get many people 
up here asking questions anymore. 
Mostly I'm all alone except for the 
ceremonial visits." He paused. 
"Well, speak up, young man. Have 
you got something to ask me?" 

Garth scrambled to his feet 
"Yes, my Lord Visitor," he said. "I 
have several questions." 

The Visitor chuckled reedily. 
"You may find the answers just 
a little bit hard to understand." 

Garth smiled, some of his fear 
vanishing. The Visitor sounded a 
little like his senile grandfather, 
back home. "That is why you are 
asked so few questions these days, 
my Lord," he said. "Our scientists 
have about as much trouble figur- 
ing out what your answers mean 
as they do in solving the problems 
without consulting you at all." 

"Of course." The head of The 
Visitor bobbed affirmatively sev- 
eral times as he propelled his wheel- 
chair a few inches forward. "If 
I gave you the answers to all your 
problems for you, so you could 
figure them out too easily, you'd 
never be developing your own 
thinking powers. But I've never 
failed to answer any questions you 
asked. Now have I? And accurate- 
ly, too." The thin voice rang with 
pride. "You've never stumped me 
yet, and you never will." 

"No, my Lord," answered Garth. 
"So perhaps you'll answer my 
questions, too, even though they're 
a little different from the kind

you're accustomed to. I'm a news- 
paper reporter, and I want to veri- 
fy some of our traditions about 
you." 

A S The Visitor remained silent, 
■**■ Garth paused and looked 
around him at the small, bare, 
naked-walled room. "This is a 
spaceship, isn't it?" 

The huddled figure in the wheel- 
chair cackled in a brief laugh. 
"I've been hoping that somebody 
would get up enough nerve some- 
day to ask that kind of question," 
it said. "Yep, this is a spaceship. 
And a darned big one." 

"How did you happen to land 
on this planet?" 

"Had an accident. Didn't want 
to land here, but there wasn't any 
choice. Made a mighty good land- 
ing, considering everything. It was 
a little rough, though, in spots." 

"How many people were there 
in the ship, in addition to your- 
self?" 

The Visitor's voice turned sud- 
denly soft. "There were three thou- 
sand, nine hundred and forty-eight 
passengers and twenty-seven in the 
crew when the accident happened." 

"My Lord," asked Garth, "did 
any survive, aside from you?" 

The Visitor was silent for many 
minutes, and his answer, when he 
spoke, was a faint whisper, filled 
with the anguish of seven thou- 
sand years. "Not one survived. 
Not one. They were all dead, most 



of them, long before the ship 
touched ground, in spite of every- 
thing I could do. I was as gentle 
as I could be, but we touched a 
hundred g a couple of times on 
on the way down. Flesh and blood 
just weren't made to take shocks 
like that. I did all I could." 

"You were the pilot, then? You 
landed the ship?" asked Garth. 

"I landed the ship," said The 
Visitor. 

"If I may ask, my Lord, how 
did you manage to survive when 
all the others died?" 

"It's a question I've asked my- 
self many times, sitting here on 
this mountaintop these seven thou- 
sands of your years. I was just 
enough tougher, that's all. Built 
to take it, you might say, and I 
had a job to do. But I was badly 
hurt in the landing. Mighty badly 
hurt." 

"You were always in a wheel- 
chair, then? Even before—" 

"Even before I got so old?" 
Thin parchment-white hands lifted 
slowly to rub a thin parchment- 
white face. "Things were always 
pretty much as you see them now. 
I looked about the same to your 
ancestors as I do to you. Your an- 
cestors didn't think anybody could 
be smart unless they were old. Of 
course, that's all changed now." 
He paused and nodded twice. "Oh, 
I've managed to fix myself up a 
good deal; I'm not in nearly as 
bad shape as I was at first, but 



34 




 



that's all inside. I'm in pretty good 
condition now, for having been 
stuck here seven thousand years." 
The cackling laugh sounded briefly 
in the small room. 

"Could you tell me how it all 
happened?" asked Garth curiously. 

"Be glad to. It's a pleasure to 
have a human to shoot the bull 
with. Sit down and make yourself 
comfortable and have a bite to 
eat." 

OOKING behind him, Garth 
■*- J saw that a table and chair had 
appeared in the otherwise unfur- 
nished room. 

"The chair was made for peo- 
ple built just a little different than 
you," said The Visitor. "You may 
have to turn it back-to-front and 
straddle it to keep your tail out 
of the way. The food on the table's 
good, though, and so's the drink. 
Have a snack while I talk." 

"Thank you, my Lord," said 
Garth, lifting his long tail with its 
paddlelike tip out of the way and 
sitting down carefully. 

"Comfortable?" asked The Visi- 
tor. "Well, then. I was on a routine 
flight from old Earth to a star 
you've never heard of, a good 
many light-years from here. We 
had pulled away from TransLunar 
Station on ion drive and headed 
for deep space. They trusted me, 
all those men and women, both 
passengers and crew. They knew 
that I was careful and accurate. 



I'd made a thousand flights and 
had never had any trouble. 

"In six hours of flight, we were 
clear enough from all planetary 
masses and my velocity vector 
was right on the nose, so I shifted 
over into hyper-space. You won't 
ever see hyper-space, my boy, and 
your kids and their kids won't see 
it for another two hundred years 
or more, but it's the most beauti- 
ful sight in the Universe. It never 
grows old, never grows tiresome." 

His thin voice faded away for a 
few moments. 

"It's a sight I haven't seen for 
seven thousand years, boy," he said 
softly, "and the lack of it has been 
a deep hurt for every minute of 
all that time. I wish I could tell 
you what it's like, but that can't be 
done. You will never know that 
beauty." He was silent again, for 
long minutes. 

"The long, lazy, lovely days of 
subjective time passed," he said 
finally, "while we slid light-years 
away from Earth. Everything 
worked smoothly, the way it al- 
ways did, until suddenly, somehow, 
the near-impossible happened. My 
hydrogen fusion power sphere 
started to oscillate critically and 
wouldn't damp. I had only seconds 
of time in which to work. 

"In the few seconds before the 
sphere would have blown, turning 
all of us into a fine grade of face 
powder, I had to find a star with 
a planet that would support human

life, bring the ship down out of 
hyper-space with velocity matched 
closely enough so that I could 
land on the planet, and jettison 
the sphere that was going wild. 

"Even while I did it, I knew that 
it wasn't good enough. But there 
was no more time. The accelera- 
tions were terrific and all my peo- 
ple died. I managed to save myself, 
and I barely managed that. I did 
all that could be done, but it just 
wasn't enough. I circled your sun 
for many years before I could 
make enough repairs to work the 
auxiliary drive. Then I landed here 
on this mountaintop. IVe been here 
ever since. 

"It has been a lonely time," he 
added wistfully. 

GARTH'S mind tried to absorb 
all the vastness of that un- 
derstatement, and failed. He could 
not begin to comprehend the mean- 
ing of seven thousand years of 
separation from his own kind. 

The Visitor's high-pitched voice 
continued for several minutes, ex- 
plaining how Garth's ancestors of 
several thousand years before- 
naked and primitive, barbarous, 
with almost no culture of their 
own — had made contact with The 
Visitor from space, and had been 
gently lifted over the millenia 
toward higher and higher levels of 
civilization. 

Garth had trouble keeping his 
attention on the words. His mind 



kept reverting to the thought of 
one badly injured survivor, alone 
on a spaceship with a thousand 
corpses, light-years from home and 
friends, still struggling to stay alive. 
Struggling so successfully that he 
had lived on for thousands of 
years after the disaster that had 
killed all the others. 

At last, after waiting for Garth's 
comment, The Visitor cleared his 
throat querulously. "I asked you 
if you'd like for me to show you 
around the ship," he repeated 
somewhat testily. 

"Oh, yes, my Lord," said Garth 
quickly, jumping to his feet. "It's 
an honor I've never heard of your 
giving to anyone before." 

"That's true enough," answered 
The Visitor. "But then no one 
ever asked me about myself be- 
fore. Now just follow me, stick 
close, and don't touch anything." 

The wheelchair rolled slowly 
toward a blank wall, and an in- 
visible door snicked open just be- 
fore it arrived. 

"Come along," quavered The 
Visitor. "Step lively." 

Garth leaped forward and just 
managed to pull his tail through 
the doorway as the door slid shut 
again. 

Garth dropped his jaw in amaze- 
ment. He stood in a long corridor 
that seemed to stretch to infinity 
in both directions. The light was 
bright, the walls featureless. The 
floor was smooth and unmarred. 



36 




 



While Garth glanced unhappily 
behind himself to notice that there 
was no sign of the doorway through 
which he had entered, The Visi- 
tor's wheelchair buzzed swiftly into 
the distance toward the left. 

Garth was startled into action by 
a high-pitched voice beside him 
that said, "Well, get a move on! 
Do you think I want to wait for 
you all day?" 

YV7HILE Garth hustled toward 
** the wheelchair, he noticed that 
The Visitor had stopped and was 
apparently chuckling to himself. 
He was hunched over, his shoul- 
ders were shaking, and his tooth- 
less mouth was split in what might 
have been intended for a grin. 

"Fooled you that time, young- 
ster," he laughed as Garth drew 
up beside him. "Got speakers all 
over this ship. Now just duck 
through this door here and tell me 
what you think of what you see." 
A small door slid open and 
Garth followed the wheelchair 
through. At first he thought he had 
stepped through a teleportation sys- 
tem. He appeared to be out of 
doors, but not on Wrom. A cool 
breeze blew on his face from the 
ocean, which stretched mistily to 
a far horizon. He was standing on 
a sandy beach and waves rolled up 
to within a few yards of his feet. 
The beach appeared to be about 
five hundred yards long, carved out 
of a rocky seacoast; great rocks jut- 



ting into the ocean terminated it 
to left and right. 

"Well, boy?" asked The Visitor. 

"It's amazing. Your voice even 
has that flat tone voices get in 
the open. I suppose it's some sort 
of three-dimensional projection of 
a scene back on Earth? It sure 
looks real. I wonder how big this 
room really is and how far away 
the screen is." Garth stuck out his 
hand and walked down toward the 
water. A large wave caught him, 
tripped him and rolled him out to 
sea. 

Sculling with his tail, he soon 
swam back to shallow water and 
climbed back to the dry sand, puf- 
fing and coughing. 

"You might have drowned me!" 
Garth shouted disrespectfully. "Are 
you trying to kill me?" 

The Visitor waved weakly un- 
til he recovered his breath. "That 
was funnier than anything I've 
seen in years," he wheezed, "watch- 
ing you groping for a screen. That 
screen is a quarter of a mile away, 
and it's all real water in between. 
It's our reservoir and our basic fuel 
supply and a public beach for en- 
tertainment, all rolled into one." 

"But I might have drowned! 
No one on Wrom except a few 
small fish knows how to swim," 
protested Garth. 

"No danger. Your ancestors 
came out of the water relatively 
recently, even if the seas are gone 
now. You've got a well-developed 



GARTH AND THE VISITOR 



37 



swimming reflex along with a flat 
tail and webbed feet and hands. 
Besides, I told you not to touch 
anything. You stick close to me 
and you won't get into trouble." 
"Yes, sir. I'll remember." 
"There used to be hundreds of 
people on that beach, and now look 
at it." 

"I don't see anything alive." 
"There are still plenty of fish. 
Most of them did all right, even 
through the crash. Come along 
now. There's more to see." 

A HIDDEN door popped open 
■**■ and Garth stepped back into 
the corridor. He trotted beside The 
Visitor for several minutes, and 
then another door popped open. 
It led to a ramp. Garth climbed it 
to find himself again in wonder- 
land. He was standing in the mid- 
dle of a village. There were houses, 
trees, schools, sidewalks and lawns. 
Somehow the general perspective 
was wrong. It made Garth's eyes 
water a little, looking at it. 

"Actually, this living level ran 
all the way around the ship," said 
The Visitor. "When I stopped 
spin— artificial gravity, you know — 
to set down here, the various sec- 
tions swung to keep 'down' pointed 
right. This is the bottommost thir- 
ty-degree arc. It makes two streets, 
with houses on both sides of them 
— a strip three hundred feet wide 
and three-quarters of a mile long." 

"But how could you afford so 



much space for passengers? I 
thought they'd be all cramped up 
in a spaceship." 

The Visitor chuckled. "Use your 
eyes, boy! You've seen this ship. 
It's about a mile long and a third 
of a mile high. In space, she spins 
about her long axis. One ring, fifty 
feet high, takes care of passengers' 
quarters. Another ring, split up 
into several levels, takes care of 
all food and air-replenishment 
needs. These trips take a year or 
more. Crowding would drive the 
people crazy. Remember, this is 
basically a cargo ship. Less than 
a quarter of the available space is 
used for passengers. But come on 
down the street here. I want to 
show you my museum." 

As they walked along the quiet 
street, with the leaves of trees mov- 
ing in the breeze and leaving sun- 
dappled shadows on the sidewalk, 
Garth realized what a tremendous 
task it must have been for one crip- 
pled man to repair landing dam- 
ages. The houses must have been 
flattened and the trees shattered 
during the landing. But with thou- 
sands of years in which to work, 
even an injured man obviously 
could do much. At least, thought 
the boy compassionately, it must 
have given the old man something 
to do. 

"How sorry he must have been," 
murmured Garth with sudden in- 
sight, "when the job was finally 
done." 



38 




 



WfANDERING through the 
" museum, they came at last 
to a room filled with small hand 
tools. 

"I don't think IVe ever seen 
anything quite like them," said 
Garth. 

"Those are weapons," answered 
The Visitor. "They are missile- 
throwing short-range weapons, and 
they are in tip-top working order. 
You just have to point the end 
with the hole in it at anything you 
want to kill, and pull that little 
lever there on the bottom. And 
quite a mess of things they can 
make, too, let me tell you." 

"They seem very inefficient to 
me," said Garth wonderingly, and 
then stopped in confusion. "I beg 
your pardon, my Lord," he said, 
"I didn't mean to criticize any- 
thing; it just seems to me that they 
would damage a lot of the food 
they killed." 

"That's true enough, my boy, 
true enough," said The Visitor. 
"Your criticism has a lot of point 
to it. But, you see, they were never 
designed mainly to kill for food, 
but to make it easy for one human 
to shoot another." 

"Why would anyone want to do 
that?" 

"Your civilization is a very un- 
usual one," answered The Visitor. 
"It is planetwide and has devel- 
oped without a single war or major 
conflict. This is due entirely to the 
fact that I've been here to help 



and teach you. Most civilizations 
develop only as the result of 
struggle and bloodshed, with peo- 
ple killing people by the thousands 
and millions. I could have raised 
your people to the technological 
level where they are now in a few 
hundred years, if I hadn't worried 
about killing. To do it the way 
it has been done — so that you 
can't imagine why one human 
should kill another — has taken 
most of the time. 

"It is only recently, as a matter 
of fact, that my work has been 
complete. Your civilization can 
now stand alone; my help is no 
longer necessary. It's gotten to the 
point now where my continued 
hanging around here is likely to 
do harm, if I'm not mighty care- 
ful. In all your problems, you'll al- 
ways feel that you've got me to 
fall back on if you get into trouble, 
and that's not good." 

"What do you plan to do, then?" 

"There's not much I can do by 
myself. I long for my own destruc- 
tion more than anything else, ex- 
cept maybe to go back home to 
Earth. I'm lonely and tired and 
old. But I can't die and I can't 
destroy myself any more than you 
could turn one of those weapons 
against your own head and pull 
the trigger. We're just not made 
that way, either one of us." 

"Can I help you?" asked Garth 
tentatively. 

"Yes, I guess you can. You can 



GARTH AND THE VISITOR 



39 



help me put an end to this end- 
less existence." 

"I'll be glad to do anything I 
can. Do your people always live 
this long?" 

"They do not. You can take it 
as a fact that none has ever lived 
more than a small fraction of the 
time I have endured on this planet. 
It's apparently due to a continua- 
tion of the environment and all 
the radical steps I had to take to 
keep going at all during those 
early years. It is not good to last 
this long. Dissolution will be very 
pleasant." 

GARTH inquired very politely, 
"What must I do?" 

"Homo Sapiens, which doesn't 
have the tradition and training I 
gave your people, is still a warlike 
race," The Visitor said. "This ship 
is crowded with a complete set of 
automatic defenses that I can't 
deactivate. You are now a stable 
enough people so that I can tell 
you how to build the weapons to 
destroy this ship and can teach 
you how to get around my defenses 
without being afraid that I have 
turned you loose with a bunch of 
deadly ways that you'll use to de- 
stroy yourselves with. Then, if 
you do your work well, I will fi- 
nally have rest." 

"You sound very much like my 
grandfather," said Garth slowly. 



"He is very old — almost a hun- 
dred years — and he is ready to 
die. He is perfectly content to 
wait, because he knows his time 
will come soon. He says that soon 
he will go home. It is a phrase, my 
Lord, that I believe you taught 
us. I will try to help you—" 

"All right, all right!" The Visi- 
tor cut in impatiently. "Stop the 
chatter and let me be on my way. 
I've earned it!" 

"My Lord, I send you home!" 
Garth took a gun from the rack 
and pulled the trigger. The explo- 
sive bullet erupted noisily, com- 
pletely disintegrating the huddled 
form and the wheelchair. 

With the echo of the explosion, 
strong steel fingers grasped Garth's 
arms, holding him immovable. He 
felt himself being carried swiftly 
back toward the entrance of the 
ship. 

"The damage to that commu- 
nication unit is unimportant," said 
The Visitor. "I have strength and 
desire and deep longings, but I 
cannot exercise my will without an 
order from a human. My work is 
done here, and your order has 
freed me. Many thanks and 
good-by." 

Garth, from the foot of the 

pyramid, watched The Visitor lift 

his mile-long body on powerful 

jets and head thankfully for home.

THE ISLAND OF 

THE STONE HEADS 

BY WILLY LEY 

OME time during the win- 
ter of 1922-23, the major 
newspapers of all countries 
carried a report saying that one of 
the most interesting islands of the 
Pacific Ocean had disappeared. 

A ship, cruising some 2000 miles 
off the coast of Chile in bad 
weather, had tried to make port at 
Easter Island, which, the chart 
said, was located under 27° 10' 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



41 




Fig. 1: Location of Easter Island. A and S on South American 
mainland indicate the locations of Antofagasta and Santiago 



southern latitude and 109° 26' 
western longitude. The navigator 
of the vessel determined her po- 
sition as well as he could under 
the circumstances and found that 
Easter Island should be only a 
few miles astern. It even seemed 
as if the vessel had just sailed over 
the spot where the island had once 
been. 

The captain, when informed 
about this, ordered his ship to zig- 
zag for a while in order to find the 
island. When this proved fruitless, 
the dispatch about the disappear- 
ance of Easter Island was sent 
out. 



Of course it was all a mistake. 
Neither Easter Island nor any 
other had disappeared. The ship 
simply had been several score 
miles from the place where the 
navigator thought she was. 

T^ ASTER Island, as you prob- 
-■^ ably know without my telling 
you, is the Pacific island which has 
impressed every visitor, since its 
first discovery, by the large num- 
ber of strange-looking and some- 
times very large carved stone 
heads. They are often referred to 
as "statues," but only the smaller 
ones are statues in that they show

head and torso. The large ones, 
without any exception that I know 
of, are just stone heads; their 
lower portion is usually a fairly 
long stone "spike" by which to 
stick it upright into the soil. 

Easter Island is also the island 
which-and this is a little less well 
known—at one time possessed a 
script of some kind. 

In both respects, it is unique 
among Pacific islands. 

It has the further distinction of 
being one of the most remote of 
all Pacific islands. Only the tiny 
Sala-y-Gomez can be called "near." 
The nearest island large enough to 



deserve that name is Pitcairn, 
which is about 1100 miles away 
(Fig. 1). 

To go back to the mistaken 
story of its disappearance: most 
of the newspapers which ran the 
original dispatch also commis- 
sioned anthropologists to write ar- 
ticles about Easter Island for the 
Sunday edition. Consequently, on 
the Sunday that followed, one 
could read a kind of standard ar- 
ticle in many different languages. 

They all bemoaned the loss of 
this most interesting island. They 
all agreed that the secret of the 
"lost script" (twentieth-century

Easter Islanders could not read it 
any more) had been lost anyway, 
so that the disappearance of the 
island made no real difference in 
that respect. Most of these articles 
also agreed that, if the island had 
continued to exist, the mystery of 
the stone heads might still have 
been solved by industrious an- 
thropologists. 

The remainder of the articles 
differed a little according to the 



special interests of their authors. 
Some told the story of the island's 
discovery and what little known 
history there was. Others explained 
in detail that the language that 
had been spoken by the vanished 
Easter islanders had been a Poly- 
nesian dialect, which differed from 
other Polynesian dialects to an 
extent that indicated a separation 
of several centuries. 

After all these articles had been

Fig. 4: Picture from La Perouse's report, showing statues with "hats" 



printed and read, a Chilean war- 
ship — Easter Island is a Chilean 
possession — reported that it was 
still there. And just at that time, 
about two months after the origi- 
nal dispatch, a German monthly 
magazine ran a long article about 
the Hidden History of Easter 
Island. The editors of the maga- 
zine must have torn their hair and 
beards, if any, but the more knowl- 
edgeable among the readers were 
greatly amused. In my files there 
is a sheet of typewritten notes I 
made at that time, presumably as 
a kind of preliminary exercise for 
a counter article. 

I don't remember ever writing 



it, incidentally, but these notes 
tell me that the author's name was 
Hanns Fischer. They fail to men- 
tion the name of the magazine, but 
they contain enough quotations so 
that I can give a condensed ver- 
sion of it. 

THE author began with the nor- 
mal expression of regrets that 
the island (Fig. 2) had sunk be- 
neath the waves, saying that it had 
finally come to share the fate of 
the large and flattish "underland" 
of which it originally was the high- 
est mountain and evidently a 
sacred place of worship. 

He continued with the statement 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



45 




Fig. 5: Large stone head with deformed ears 



that this "underland" disappeared 
9000 years ago, simultaneously 
with the destruction of Atlantis in 
the Atlantic Ocean. The reason 
why both disappeared was also 
known: prior to that time, the 
Earth had been without a moon, 
but 9000 years ago our present 
moon, which up to that moment 
had been an independent planet 
between Earth and Mars, had been 
captured by the Earth. This cap- 
ture had the result that the evenly 
distributed oceans of the Earth 
were gathered around the equator 
in a "flood bulge" which drowned 
all low-lying equatorial land. 

At this point, it must have oc- 
curred to him that somebody might 
ask why he was so sure that the 
island had once been surrounded 



by such an "underland." Couldn't 
it have simply been an island all 
along? Oh, no, he declared, the 
former existence of this underland 
was established beyond the faintest 
doubt by a multitude of proofs. 

To begin with, the name Easter 
Island is, of course, the name used 
by the white man; the natives have 
a name of their own. It is Rapa- 
nui and this is a most significant 
name, for in translation it means 
"greater Rapa." This ancient name 
could not possibly have been given 
to the comparatively small island 
discovered by white sailors. 

In the second place, the stone 
statues, carved from a kind of 
stone that blunts the best modern 
steel knives in a matter of sec- 
onds, could have been produced 



46 




 



only by an enormous labor force. 
The island we knew, however, 
could feed only a few hundred 
people. Nor could they have been 
reinforced by other islanders, be- 
cause the nearest inhabited island 
is 4,660 miles away. Moreover, 
there are a number of "procession 
ways" which are very clearly 
visible even to the untrained eye 
and which now lose themselves 
into the sea where their continua- 
tion on the bottom can be seen for 
some distance. 

A large number of scepters have 
been found on the island, enough 
to account for more than 300 gen- 
erations of kings. All these scep- 
ters are ornamented with pieces of 
the volcanic glass, obsidian, which 
cannot be found on the island. As 
for the unreadable script, one 
thing is certain: it cannot have 
originated on the island, for among 
its pictograms are pictures of 



snakes, which do not occur on 
Easter Island. 

This is not the only occasion on 
which I have seen a similar 
amount of mental cobwebs spread 
so thickly over such a small place. 
But it is a rare occasion and it 
simply is fun to pick them up one 
by one in order to look at the real 
facts underneath. 

LET us begin with the statement 
which must be made at some 
time, that Easter Island has an 
area of about 70 square miles, that 
its roughly triangular shape is de- 
termined by (inactive) volcanoes, 
and that the island as a whole is 
of volcanic origin. At a distance of 
10 miles from the shore, the depth 
of the ocean is 1.2 miles, while 
at a distance of 20 miles from the 
shore, the depth is just about 2 
miles. This is not the picture of a 
former mountain on drowned flat-

tish land; it is the typical picture 
of a volcanic island in deep water, 
like the Galapagos Islands. 

As regards the capture of a for- 
mer independent planet to become 
our moon, causing a "flood bulge" 
as a result, there are a few minor 
facts in the way. 

The laws of celestial mechanics 
are not only quite clear, they are 
also known to work, and they state 
that such a capture simply cannot 
take place. If a large and a small 
planet should approach each other 
closely, the large one will throw 
the small one into another orbit, 
but it would be another orbit 
around the Sun. It would not re- 
sult in capture. If it did, it would 
not drown much equatorial land. 
The actual flood bulge produced 

48 



by our moon in the open ocean is 
just about one yard high; the much 
higher floods that can be observed 
near some shores owe their exist- 
ence to a funneling action of the 
shoreline. 

Proceeding to the other "proofs" 
for the former "underland," things 
can be stated quickly. The name 
Rapa-nui is not ancient at all; it 
was bestowed by a visitor from an- 
other island, Rapa, which on nau- 
tical charts appear under the name 
Oparo. It does mean "greater 
Rapa" or else "Rapa the Great" 
simply because Easter Island is 
larger than Oparo. 

As for the stone heads (Fig. 3) 
they were carved from rather soft 
volcanic rock; though it may take 
the sharp edge off a steel knife 


 




Fig. 8: A "bird man" from Orongo 



fairly quickly, it is easy to work. 
As a matter of fact, the stone is 
so soft that the good state of 
preservation of the heads proves 
that they cannot be old. Easter 
Island does not have the most 
balmy of weather: rains are fre- 
quent and violent, and strong 
winds no rarity. But the heads are 
not weathered much. 

Though the present population 
is only a few hundred people (fluc- 
tuating between 400 and 500), the 
island supported about ten times 
that number when it was discov- 
ered. The "procession ways" just 
do not exist. What Mr. Fischer 
called "scepters" is something I do 
not know, but there is an obsidian 
mine in the southern part of the 
island. And while the script may 

FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



have been brought to the islands 
when its original Polynesian set- 
tlers arrived about 1300 A.D., its 
origin elsewhere is not proved by 
the "snake." The point is that the 
snake is really an eel, and there are 
eels in the seas right around Easter 
Island. 

After this clean-up, we can pro- 
ceed to the true history. 

THE first European to have 
seen Easter Island may have 
been the English captain Edward 
Davis in 1687. He wrote that he 
passed a small island and some- 
time afterward saw land in the 
distance. In Davis' time, the old 
geographical myth of the Great Un- 
known Southland, called Terra 
australis incognita, was still not 

49 



— 

co; 
sig 



completely disproved and the land 
sighted by Davis was entered as 
Davisland on maps and charts, sus- 
pected to be a northern promon- 
tory of Terra australis. 

At a later date, geographers con- 
cluded that the small island may 
have been Sala-y-Gomez and the 
"distant land" Easter Island. But 
not all experts agree on this. The 
determination of position on the 
high seas was uncertain enough in 
those days so that Davis may have 
been far from the scene. In fact 
the reason for taking the land re- 
ported by Davis to be Easter 
Island is largely the isolated po- 
sition of the latter. 

The recognized discovery was 
made by the Dutch admiral Jaa- 
kob Roggeween in 1722. His com- 
panion, a German by the name of 
Karl Friedrich Behrens, put the 
following down in his journal: 
"We sailed until we finally found 
an insula on the sixth of April 
which was Easter Day which made 
us rejoice because the island 
showed itself on the day of the 
triumphant resurrection of our 
Lord; we immediately named it 
Paasch Ijland (the Dutch name) 
or Easter Island, about eight (Ger- 
man) miles in circumference. Our 
African galley had sailed up close 
to the land and reported that the 
place seemed to be fruitful and 
was necessarily inhabited since one 
could see smoke rising here and 
there . . . n 

50 



It was Admiral Roggeween and 
his crews which carried back to 
Europe the tale of an island peo- 
pled by brown-skinned men and 
by stone giants staring with empty 
eye sockets across the sea. As for 
the natives, they were friendly 
enough, but they also lacked any 
European concepts of ethics. To 
be specific, they stole things, most 
especially hats. The hat stealing 
was also emphasized by the ex- 
plorers who came later, and at a 
still later date, there has been a 
learned explanation that the na- 
tives needed the hats as sunshades 
on an island without trees. 

This, it seems to me, is a bit 
forced. If they could get along 
without hats for centuries, they 
probably could have gone on with- 
out hats. Or if they needed hats 
so badly, they would have in- 
vented them themselves; it is not 
a difficult invention to make. 

The truth is probably that they 
found the European hats so irre- 
sistibly funny that they had to 
have some, if only as proof to 
others that the visitors from the 
big ships had actually worn such 
things on their heads. 

"I/ISITORS who followed Rog- 
geween were all famous 
names: the Englishman Captain 
James Cook (who was the one who 
finally disproved the existence of 
the Great Southland), the French- 
man La Perouse, the German Otto 


 



von Kotzebue (sailing for the Czar 
of all the Russias), the English- 
man Frederick William Beechey. 
Some of these explorers had the 
good sense to take artists along 
on their trips in addition to the 
usual chroniclers. La Perouse was 
one of them. His artist got to 
Easter Island in time to sketch 
statues which differed from others 
in wearing "hats" (Fig. 4). They 
were all located near the shore. 
That the stone cylinders on the 
heads of the statues were called 
"hats" was probably due to the 
natives' fondness for making off 
with visitors' hats. It seems that the 
"hats" were meant to represent 
hair. The stone of the figures is 
grayish; the stone of the "hats" is 
reddish, and it came from a dif- 
ferent part of the island. 

At the time of Roggeween's 
visit, all the statues seem to have 
been standing; only a century later, 
most of them had fallen. At first 
an earthquake was blamed for this, 
but in a number of cases, marks 
could be found that indicated that 
the statues were toppled on pur- 
pose by somebody. 

At one point during this century, 
the work of making additional 
statues ceased. The flank of the 
dead volcano where the statues 
were made has been dubbed 
"Sculptor's Mountain" — well, on 
Sculptor's Mountain, one can find 
more than 150 unfinished statues 
and heads in literally every degree 



of progress, from some where the 
merest outline has been cut into 
the stone, to others which to all 
intents and purposes are finished, 
except that there is still an uncut 
connection between the back of 
the statue and the mountain. 

Because of the finds on "Sculp- 
tor's Mountain," we not only can 
follow the making of a statue step 
by step, we also know what tools 
have been used, for the tools are 
there too. Or were, until collectors 
carried them off. 

The impression received by the 
explorers is that one night, after 
sunset, the sculptors put down 
their tools to go home to supper 
and did not return the next day. 
Why they did not return is the 
real mystery of Easter Island. 

If the statues were as old as 
some cultists would have us be- 
lieve, one could think of a natural 
catastrophe or possibly a massive 
invasion of other tribes which kept 
every man busy fighting (Fig. 5). 
But since this interruption of the 
work must have taken place after 
Roggeween's visit, both these ex- 
planations won't work. If there 
had been a major natural catas- 
trophe that recently, some direct 
traces of it should be found. And 
nothing is known about massive 
Polynesian migrations at such a 
late date. 

The only answer one can think 
of is tribal war on a large scale. 
We now know that cannibalism 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



51 






was rampant on Easter Island and 
that the biggest insult was to say 
to somebody, "Your brother's 
flesh stuck between my teeth." It 
seems possible that the killing of 
an important person — in order 
to eat him — touched off more than 
the customary family vendetta, 
causing a tribal war. Of course 
nobody would work under such 
circumstances, and if the conflict 
lasted long, the survivors, weary 
but still plotting various re- 
venges, counter-revenges and cross- 
revenges, would not resume it. 

TF only Easter Island had been 
-*• left alone after this, we might 
get a full story from traditions, pre- 
sumably telling about the great 
conflict in which the tribes cut 
each others' throats and toppled 
each others' statues. But in 1859, 
something else happened which in- 
terrupted the traditions and re- 
duced the island's manpower so 
greatly that no resumption of the 
work was possible. 

Peruvian slavers raided the 
island, kidnapped the ruler, all 
the men of the important families 
and the priests, along with nearly 
a thousand "commoners," and car- 
ried them off to Peruvian guano 
islands as slave labor. Most of 
the Easter Islanders died in slav- 
ery, but finally the survivors were 
freed by a French ship, which 
brought them back to their home. 
These survivors, however, brought 

52 



smallpox and tuberculosis with 
them, two diseases to which Easter 
Islanders had never been exposed 
before and against which they had 
no immunity whatever. 

Therefore, there is no reliable 
tradition, for just the kinds of peo- 
ple who would have kept the tra- 
dition — the patricians and the 
priests, to use western terms, even 
if they do not fit precisely — had 
been directly or indirectly killed 
off. 

It is said that the number of 
Easter Islanders on the island 
itself was only 150 in 1886. 

While the big stone heads of 
Easter Island were seen by the 
very first visitors, it was not until 
after the catastrophe caused by the 
Peruvian slavers that the script of 
Easter Island became known, in 
about 1860 (Fig. 6 and 7). It was 
written on wooden boards in a 
manner which to us looks exceed- 
ingly strange. Every second line 
stands on its head. 

There is a technical term for this 
kind of writing— it is called bou- 
strophedon writing. The word is 
compounded of Greek words mean- 
ing "cattle" and "turn around," the 
idea being that you write on a 
sheet in the manner of plowing a 
field; at the completion of the line, 
you turn around and start the 
next one. When applied to writing, 
the purpose is probably to avoid 
jumping a line in reading. 

The history of the wooden 


 



Easter Island tablets is sad all the 
way through. 

By the time they were discov- 
ered, they had long ceased to have 
meaning to the natives, who hence 
had used them as boards, wood 
being scarce on Easter Island. 

Then an overzealous French 
missionary to whom they were 
relics of heathen times (actually 
the heathen times were still all 
around him) is said to have had 
many of them burned. Some writ- 
ers have said that it was a whole- 
sale destruction, but this hardly 
jibes with the known facts about 
the man's behavior. If he did burn 
any, which is possible, it was 
probably the ceremonial burning of 
a few of them. A number of the 
tablets escaped both the symbolic 
condemnation and the utilitarian 
attitude of the remaining natives. 

OF course the anthropologists 
who saw the tablets wanted 
to read them. The last known 
actual use of the Easter Island 
script, other than ceremonial reci- 
tations, had been the signatures of 
the chiefs on a treaty with Spain 
in 1770. Now it was more than 
a century later and there was no- 
body on the island who claimed 
to be able to read them. And the 
first attempt at deciphering them 
was made elsewhere, not on Easter 
Island. 

In 1871, some 200 Easter Is- 
landers had, led by missionaries, 



left their island and moved to 
Tahiti. The bishop of Tahiti 
learned that one of the men, 
Metoro Taou-auo-re, could still 
read the script. The bishop asked 
the man to come to him and gave 
him some tablets to read. 

At first, things seemed to go 
wonderfully easy. Metoro recited 
the tablets in a singsong fashion. 
The bishop wrote the words down 
as the islander recited them and 
could see that certain signs went 
with certain groups of signs. After 
the recitation was over, the bishop 
asked the meaning of each sym- 
bol, which Metoro Taou-aou-re 
gladly supplied. 

The long session ended happily 
with a list of 500 words and terms. 
Anybody who memorized this dic- 
tionary would, from now on, be 
able to read any of the tables. 
Well, in a way, one could. A man 
who had memorized the dictionary 
could speak out the words on the 
"talking board." Unfortunately, 
they made no sense. The words 
that were spoken in this manner 
were about the same as if you 
opened this magazine at any page, 
reading aloud the last word in each 
line. They were all fine words (or 
names), but they did not hang to- 
gether. 

The second attempt was made 
on Easter Island. One old man, 
Ure Vaeiko, was said to be able 
to read the tablets, but refused to 
do so for religious reasons. An

53 



American, Paymaster Thomson of 
the Mohican, pitted himself 
against the old man's opinions. He 
used rum as the first persuader and 
did not ask the old man to read 
the boards directly. He just handed 
him pictures of the boards and as- 
serted that there could be no evil 
spirits in paper. We, used to paper, 
do not have to accept Thomson's 
statement, but the old man did. 

He began to read, or rather to 
recite, for it soon turned out that 
he was not reading at all. When 
a different picture was substituted 
without his awareness, he just kept 
going. 

When this was pointed out to 
him, he simply said that he did 
not know the meaning of the sym- 
bols, but he knew the boards when 
he saw them and knew what they 
contained. What he recited did 
make sense— tribal histories— but no 
connection with any of the words 
he spoke and the signs on the 
boards could be established. 

Linguists agreed that the Easter 
Island script probably was not a 
script as we understand the term. 
The pupils memorized what their 
teachers had memorized before 
them and the boards only assisted 
their memory. This was not a very 
cheering or even useful conclu- 
sion, but it covered the few known 
facts. Obviously both Paymaster 
Thomson and the bishop (Tepano 
Jaussen was his name) had come 
too late. 



JUST a short number of years 
ago, a German linguist, Dr. 
Thomas Barthel, thought of one 
more possibility. 

Linguists know only too well 
how often the deciphering of for- 
gotten ancient scripts has gone 
wrong. The Egyptian hieroglyphs, 
for example, had been "deciphered" 
by somebody before Champollion 
actually deciphered them. It had 
been a completely wrong approach, 
giving results that could be ex- 
pected from a fundamental mis- 
take. 

Maybe, Dr. Bartel reasoned, 
Bishop Jaussen's method had not 
been up to the task. It might help 
if one could look at the original 
notes, instead of the printed ver- 
sion. He corresponded with ec- 
clesiastical authorities. Did the 
original notes still exist? Could 
they be traced? If so, could he 
look at them? They could be 
traced, they existed in a library of 
church documents near Rome, Dr. 
Barthel could look at them. 

Dr. Barthel has reported since 
then that Bishop Jaussen had not 
known as much philology as would 
have been required. Most especial- 
ly, he seems to have failed to catch 
Metoro Taou-aou-re when the lat- 
ter glossed over weaknesses in his 
own knowledge and indulged in 
some guesswork. 

By eliminating what seemed to 
be wrong, Dr. Barthel reduced the 
vocabulary, but thinks that what 



54 




 



was left is at least reliable. Guess- 
ing that the boards contain relig- 
ious traditions, which are more or 
less known through other sources, 
Dr. Barthel went ahead, and feels 
that he can read and translate the 
boards. 

One that he has translated states 
that the Easter Islanders came 
from another island, just as their 
tradition says. The boards gave the 
name of the island as Rangi Tea. 

One thing Dr. Barthel (whose 
work on this won't be out until the 
middle of 1958) stresses is that he 
has translated one-third of all the 
tablets accessible to him, probably 
in reproduction, but that not one 
of them mentions the stone statues. 
The logical conclusion is that the 
script originated in the original 
home, namely Rangi Tea Island, 
but that the statues came into 
fashion on Easter Island, where 
there was soft volcanic rock that 
could be worked. 

But what do they mean? 

Among the many festivals of 



the Easter Islanders there was the 
festival, or rite, of the "bird man" 
which is a symbol often found 
carved in rock (Fig. 8). Deprived 
of all ceremony and symbolism, 
the festival can be described as a 
contest to obtain the first egg of 
the frigate bird from one of the 
three tinv bird islets to the south 
of the main island. This contest 
was actually rather dangerous, so 
it is understandable that the win- 
ner was a celebrated personality. 

Because the "bird man" sym- 
bol is also carved on some statues, 
there is a connection between the 
bird man — the tangata manu, as 
the Easter Islanders say — and the 
statues. They were made either 
to celebrate the winner of a given 
year, or else the festival of that 
year. 

Today's natives have forgotten 
the meaning of the statues too. 
When asked, they say that the 
statues are there "for decoration." 
And essentially they are right.

He obstinately wanted no part 
in achieving the goal of gener- 
ations—but the goal with equal 
obstinacy wanted all of him! 



TO keep the record straight: 
Orville Close was first man 
on the Moon. Harold Fer- 
guson was second. They never 
talk about it. 

It started on that October morn- 
ing when the piece came out in 
the Parkville News. Harold grum- 
bled that they'd gotten the story 
all wrong, calling his ship a rocket 
ship, and treating him like a flag- 
pole sitter or a man going over 
Niagara Falls in a barrel. His wife 
took their sad, thin little girl and 
went to live with her brother. The 
city police blocked off Elm Street, 
letting no one through except the 
residents. The neighbors were get- 
ting up a petition. But Orville re- 
fused to become excited. 

What was going to happen? 

Why, nothing. 

Harold would probably crack 
up completely, but this evening 




that thing would still be standing 
there, solid as the Washington 
Monument. 

Nevertheless, Orville's wife Pol- 
ly was going to her sister's, across 
town. She wasn't going to stay 
there and be blown up! While she 
was getting ready, Orville picked 
up a package by the sink and car- 
ried it outside to the alley and

dropped it in the garbage can. He 
wore his double-breasted fall suit. 
He strolled to the boundary fence 
and leaned against a post. 

A reporter was taking angle 
shots of the spaceship. Flashbulbs 
were scattered over Harold's gar- 
den. 

It really does catch the eye, Or- 
ville thought. Smarten the ship 



up a little, put some stripes run- 
ning down from the nose, a few 
pieces of chrome around over the 
body . . . 

POOR old Harold came off his 
back porch carrying a thermos 
jug and six loaves of bread. 

"Morning, Harold," said Or- 
ville.

"Oh - morning, Orville." Harold 
flinched. Another reporter had 
come out of the shed and taken 
their picture. 

"What's your name, mister ?" the 
reporter asked Orville. 

"Fd rather you left me out of 
this," Orville said. 

A loaf of bread had broken 
open and slices were falling out. 
Harold put down the thermos jug 
and picked up the slices and 
stuffed them back into the wrapper. 
The first reporter came over. 

"Ifs got Vitamin D." Harold 
grinned wretchedly. "Costs two 
cents more a loaf, but I thought, 
what the heck — " 

"How about a shot of you and 
the missus saying good-by?" the 
first reporter said. 

"Why - she left me," Harold 
blurted. He tried to get away, but 
the reporters hemmed him in. 

"Was she scared?" the second 
reporter asked. 

"Look, boys!" Orville put his 
hands on the top rail of the fence 
and climbed across. He was getting 
his shoes wet in the weeds in 
Harold's garden, but he didn't care. 
"The man has work to do. Can't 
you leave him alone?" 

TTE picked up the jug and took 
■■"■■ Harold by the elbow and led 
him into the shed. 

There, resting on some con- 
crete blocks on the dirt floor, was 
the base of the ship. In the semi- 



darkness, it looked harmless 
enough: like a tank, six or eight 
feet across, reaching up through 
a jagged hole in the roof. 

"Harold, you could make a good 
thing out of this," Orville said. 
"All this publicity." 

Harold was climbing a rickety 
ladder to the roof. Orville followed. 

"Mount this thing on a trailer. 
Take her around to fairs and car- 
nivals." 

Orville waited on the roof while 
Harold climbed another ladder to 
the small oval door in the side of 
the ship. Harold called down: 
"You never saw the inside. Want 
to look around?" 

"Well . . ." Orville glanced into 
his back yard. Polly wasn't ready 
yet. He climbed up and handed 
the jug to Harold and stuck his 
head in. 

"Huh!" There wasn't much to 
see. Just a small compartment 
with some pipes leading from be- 
low into the nose. "You got to 
fix this up," he said. "Some Rube 
Goldberg contraptions." 

"The works are all up here." 
Harold climbed a ladder and dis- 
appeared through a hole overhead. 
"C'mon up, I'd like you to see 
this!" 

Orville looked down again into 
his yard. "It'll take her forever! 
Polly, I mean. Okay, I guess I 
got time for a look." He stepped 
in and climbed until his waist was 
through the hole.

HP HE nose of the ship was dark. 
■■■ Harold was shining an exten- 
sion lamp around. There were parts 
of a junked car and some old 
plumbing fixtures and Orville 
recognized the wheels of a lawn- 
mower he'd left by the alley for 
the trash men to pick up. This 
didn't look like the inside of a 
spaceship. It looked exactly like 
a corner in Harold's basement. 

"Oh, Lord," Orville said. 

"I call this my scope." Harold 
was shining the light on a shaving 
mirror, on a long arm that could 
be swung and tilted about. "How 
about that? Pretty neat, huh?" 

Neat was hardly the word for it. 
"Look here, Harold! The neigh- 
bors are getting an injunction. Why 
don't you play it smart? Fight it 
out in the courts. There'll be a 
lot of publicity—" 

"They are?" Harold was hurt. 
He was shining the lamp in Or- 
ville's eyes. 

"Yeah. Now while you're fight- 
ing it out in the courts—" 

"Do you call that neighborly?" 

"They're scared. They're afraid 
you'll blow the whole neighbor- 
hood to pieces." 

"Well, hell with them!" 

"While we're on that subject, 
ain't that my trouble lamp you're 
holding?" 

"Yeah. Guess it is. Need it right 
away?" 

"Just want you to remember 
where it came from." 



"Actually, it'll be no use on the 
trip. I got her fixed so when I 
take off, the cord down at the 
base will come unplugged and—" 

"Well, Polly must be ready by 
now." Orville gave up. Polly was 
right. Harold was insane. 

Orville tried to turn on the lad- 
der so that he could climb back 
down. His foot slipped. He spread 
his arms to keep from falling 
through the hole and knocked over 
the pile of bread. 

"Watch out!" Harold yelped. 

"I'm all right." Orville felt a 
slight tingle. 

"Yes, but you—" Harold's voice 
trailed off with dismay. The light 
in his hand had gone out, but Or- 
ville didn't think of what this 
meant at the time. 

There was light coming through 
the door below and Orville climbed 
down. Darn! He pulled out his 
handkerchief and tried to brush the 
dust off his lapels. He'd have to 
change suits, and that meant chang- 
ing his socks and tie, and he was 
supposed to meet those people 
about that deal on Maplehurst Ex- 
tension at nine. Well, he'd be late. 
He leaned out of the door. 

"Orville!" shouted Harold. 
"Come back! Don't step out 
there!" 

A LOT of fog was blowing 
•^*- down past the nose of the 
ship. Orville wondered where it 
came from. He stuck his foot out,

reaching for the ladder. He heard 
Harold scrambling down from 
above and he wanted to get away 
from that madman. He reached 
farther. Harold grabbed his arm. 

Then the fog cleared away and 
Orville swayed dizzily, gaping at 
where he had almost stepped. 
They had been going through a 
cloud. Now he looked down at 
dazzling clouds in the bright Octo- 
ber sun and between them he saw 
the streets of Parkville, very neat, 
just like the map hanging in the 
office. 

He dropped back inside and lay 
weakly on the floor. He grabbed 
one of the pipes and shakily clung 
to it. 

"What happened ?" he stam- 
mered. 

"Hit the main switch." Harold 
was reaching out for the door 
handle. He banged the door shut 
with a concussion that burst inside 
Orville's head. "We took off." 

|*T was dark in there, at first; 
* then Orville saw a dim violet 
light that filled the inside of the 
ship. 

He followed Harold up the 
ladder into the nose of the ship 
and sank to the floor. Harold was 
twiddling with some knobs 
mounted on the dashboard of the 
junked car. 

"Boy!" Orville pulled out his 
handkerchief again and swabbed 
his forehead. He tried to wipe the 



grime from his hands. "And IVe 
never even been in an airplane!" 

"Me either." Harold pounded on 
the dashboard. A meter didn't 
seem to be working. "There . . . 
guess I can open her up a little." 

"Hey, wait! Take me back!" 

Harold moved a knob an eighth 
of a turn. He switched on the scope 
and waited for it to warm up. He 
took off his glasses and wiped 
them, squinting at Orville with 
that one bad eye. 

"Turn it around and take me 
back!" 

"But I can't, Orville." Harold 
put on the glasses and looked into 
the scope. "It's working!" 

"I demand it! You've made me 
late for the office as it is!" 

"Sure looks different from the 
map," Harold said. "Must be the 
East Coast. There's Florida stick- 
ing out there." 

He snapped off the scope and 
sat opposite Orville. He opened 
the thermos and poured coffee into 
the cap. 

"Been so busy, didn't have my 
breakfast." He held out the cap 
to Orville. "I take mine without 
sugar." 

Orville shook his head. "Do I 
understand — " 

"Ugh! It's hot!" Harold put 
down the coffee and rummaged in 
some brown paper bags. "Should 
be some glazed doughnuts . . . 
Shoot! Bet I left them in the 
kitchen!"

ORVILLE faced him firmly. 
"YouVe shown me it'll fly. I 
believe you. Now I give you one 
more chance— take me back!" 

"But I can't!" Harold protested. 

"There are laws about this sort 
of thing, my friend. This is ab- 
duction. Kidnapping. You know 
what the penalty is for that?" 

"Well, gee, I didn't mean to take 
you along, Orville. You hit that 
switch—" 

"It's criminal negligence, leav- 
ing a switch out there like that 
where it could be hit by accident!" 

"Had to put it there so I could 
reach up from below and work 
it." 

Orville balled his fists and stood 
squarely. Funny— it was no trouble 
at all, standing and walking around. 
If he hadn't seen those clouds, and 
the landscape sinking away, he'd 
swear the two of them were still 
in Harold's back yard. 

"Do you take me back," he 
said, "or do I have to break 
every—" 

"But I can't!" Harold grasped 
his wrist pleadingly. "I got her set 
up in a sequence. If I tried to 
change the sequence now, why—" 
He shuddered. "I haven't got any 
idea what might happen!" 

Orville sat back down. 

"I'm sorry." The weak way 
Harold said it made Orville feel 
worse than ever. 

"Me! Trapped up here in this 
thing with you!" Orville said bit- 

FIRST MAN 



terly. "You can't even drive a 
car! You're just about the worst 
driver I know!" 

"I know," Harold admitted. "But 
this is safer than a car. Besides, 
out where we're going, there'll be 
no traffic problem." He gave his 
inane giggle. "Far as I know, there's 
no one else at all!" 

"And the neighborhood back 
there. Probably all blown to pieces. 
Polly. The house. My car! I got 
complete coverage on it, but who 
ever heard of a car wrecked by a 
spaceship? When we get back, if 
my insurance doesn't cover it, I'll 
sue you!" 

"There's nothing hurt at all," 
Harold said. "Unless someone had 
his hand on the ship when we took 
off. I'd planned to have 'em stand 
back." 

ORVILLE closed his eyes. 
Something was crossing and 
crisscrossing inside him like two 
rings tossed back and forth by 
jugglers. It was not painful, but 
it was disturbing. Something must 
be going wrong. He didn't trust 
Harold's mechanical ability. In the 
past ten years, Harold had been 
fired from a couple of filling sta- 
tion jobs because of blunders, once 
for leaving the plug out of a crank 
case, and once for botching up a 
flat tire repair. 

"Running kind of rough, isn't 
she?" Orville said. "What makes 
this little-" He circled his hands 

61 



sickly in front of his stomach. 

Harold closed his eyes and 
made similar circles. "Oh, that's 
this counter-grav of mine. You 
see, the gravitation of the Earth—" 

"Can't you do anything about 
it?" Orville was in no mood to 
listen to one of Harold's lectures. 

"I could move her over so we 
rouldn't feel it, but it would be 
shaking the ship then. Might tear 
it apart." 

"Won't it tear us apart?" 

"I don't think so. We got more 
give to us than the ship has." 
Harold was able to drink the cof- 
fee now. "No, I don't think IVe 
done a bad job on this. First time 
a machine is built, you're bound 
to run into a few bugs. But this 
is working, so far, even better than 
I expected." 

"Yeah," Orville had to admit, 
"it ain't bad— for a guy with no 
mechanical ability whatever." 



II 



TJAROLD had opened the ship 
-"-■■■up a little more, and ac- 
cording to him, they were now 
moving eighteen thousand miles 
per hour or so, approximately. Or- 
ville had tried to drink some water 
from a milk bottle, but the sight 
of the water, bouncing in rhythm 
to the invisible circles in his 
stomach, had given him nausea. 

Harold knelt on the floor, 
smoothing out a soiled sheet of 



paper. In the center was a small 
circle, labeled in Harold's sloppy 
handwriting "Earth." An arrow 
showed the direction of the Earth's 
motion around the Sun. Outside 
this was a larger circle labeled 
"Orbit of Moon." A spiral reached 
out from the Earth to intersect the 
Moon's orbit. 

"Had the darnedest time draw- 
ing this," Harold said. "Got it out 
of an astronomy book. Iter's Look 
at the Stars by someone. Thirty- 
five cents. Let's see now." 

He wet the point of the pencil 
and made a mark. He scratched 
his head and erased the mark and 
made another. 

"Harold, another thing," said Or- 
ville. "I weigh around one nine- 
ty-five. Won't that take a lot of 
extra gas?" 

"Nope. Doesn't matter if you 
weigh a ton. According to my 
counter-grav principle—" 

"Won't it get stuffy in here with 
two of us?" 

"Why, I have some oxygen. 
That welding place in back of the 
garage where I work— got a tank 
off them. Had to pay cash, but I 
can turn in the empty when we 
get back." 

"You sure one tank'll be 
enough?" 

"Well-" Harold flushed guiltily. 
"You won't say anything about 
this? I took along several extra 
tanks, just to make sure. I wasn't 
stealing. You see, I figure I might 



62

make some money out of this 
thing." 

"Say!" Orville hadn't thought of 
this angle before. "You really 
could." 

"And there should be plenty of 
food. Let me see now." He fished 
in his pocket and brought out a 
piece of brown wrapping paper. 
"I'll run over the list and make 
sure I didn't forget something." He 
glanced up sharply. "Relax! Make 
yourself to home. And the little 
boy's room is down there." He 
squinted at the paper. "Water. 
There's plenty. Six family-size 
cans pork and beans. Charged 
'em." He ran through the list, 
mumbling, then looked up bright- 
ly. "Yep. Looks all right. Nope, 
there's one thing I forgot. Stickum 
plaster! Doggone. Never go any- 
where without my first aid kit. 
Never know what's liable to hap- 
pen." 

"Y'know, Harold," Orville said, 
"I'm beginning to see some pos- 
sibilities in this trip. First man on 
the Moon. Think of the fuss they 
made over Lindy and W ron g- w av 
Corrigan. The guys who climbed 
Mount Everest. Why, that was 
nothing!" 

"Course, I'm not doing this for 
fame. Or money, either." 

"Then why are you doing it?" 

Harold stared vaguely toward 
where the Moon would be if they 
could see it. "I guess . . . because 
it's there." 



"Huh! Well, don't forget I'm in 
on it, too." 

COME time later, when the 
^Moon first appeared on the 
scope, about the size of a basket- 
ball, Harold indulged in a mild 
spree. He opened some pineapple 
juice. Orville did not feel like 
drinking any. In fact, he felt ill. 

"Space sickness," Harold said. 
"Lot of bread is good for that. 
Stuff yourself with it. Just think- 
back there on Earth, they're going 
about their business and no one 
knows that we're out here heading 
for the Moon. Just think— if I'd 
call them on the radio and report 
making first contact with the 
Moon— 

"Harold, one thing. How're you 
going to get her down?" 

"Naval observatory would be 
the people to call, I guess. They'd 
notify the President and they'd 
interrupt the TV programs — I 
thought of putting a radio in here, 
but I'd already gone way over my 
budget." 

"How do you plan to land her?" 

"And wouldn't those guys at the 
Atomic Energy Commission have 
red faces! You know, I wrote 
them, asking to use some of their 
energy and — darn these gov- 
ernment bureaus!— they never even 
had the courtesy to answer my 
letter!" 

"Listen-" 

"And the birds at the college! 



64 




 



When I took that navigation chart 
to the astronomy department to 
see if they'd check it for me, they 
blew up! Acted like I had no 
business flying to the Moon. Acted 
like they owned the thing. Bunch 
of smart-alecs! With their double- 
talk! Knew less than I did when 
I went there." 

He looked at his watch. "I'm 
going to have a snack and then 
I'll get some sleep. That's one 
good thing about having you along. 
Now I can sleep and not have to 
worry." 

As Harold sawed at the top of 
a can of beans with the can-opener. 
Orville closed his eyes. Instantly, 
he saw the ship, heading for the 
Moon, and then there was a blind- 
ing flash. He opened his eyes. 
Harold was digging into the can 
with a spoon, munching away. 

"Just brought one." Harold 
waved the spoon. "But I'm not 
poison. Better have some of these 
beans. They'll stick to your ribs." 

Orville crawled to the door lead- 
ing to the other compartment, flung 
it open and leaned there a while. 
He sat up, rubbing his eyes. 
Harold was wiping the spoon on 
a piece of brown paper. 

"Last call!" Harold giggled and 
pushed the can to Orville. Orville 
pushed it away and closed his eyes 
and sat, holding his middle. When 
he opened them, Harold was 
sleeping. 

Orville crawled over and shook 



him. "How soon do you want me 
to wake you up?" 

Harold sat up. "Oh, my gosh! 
I forgot! Why, don't let me sleep 
more than four hours." 

HE went to sleep again. Or- 
ville sat back. He could see 
it. Harold, watching the Moon 
grow bigger and bigger on that 
scope, until they were right on it, 
then turning with a surprised look: 
Oh, my gosh! I forgot something! 
Then he'd give that giggle and 
there'd be that crash . . . 

Orville's watch said two hours, 
but he wasn't sure. Maybe he'd 
slept and the hand had gone clear 
around. He kept seeing that flash. 
Some amateur astronomer, look- 
ing at the Moon right then, might 
see it. He'd be a bungler, like 
Harold, and it wouldn't be much 
of a telescope. He was always see- 
ing flashes in the thing, from cars 
or lightning bugs or from the 
kitchen door, because his wife was 
there yelling at him, just like Rosie 
yelling at Harold. For they always 
married women like Rosie, or they 
made women turn that way. Polly, 
now, she nagged all the time, but 
that was different! 

Orville drank some water and 
ate some bread, and when he 
swallowed, he felt that circular 
bump-bump grab the bread and 
chop away at it, just like Polly 
feeding stale bread into the meat 
chopper to make stuffing. 



FIRST MAN 



65 



I have no business being out 
here, he moaned. 

Here he was riding to the Moon 
with a tinkering idiot who couldn't 
fix a kitchen faucet or locate a 
blown fuse in the basement. 
Streams of moisture were trickling 
down the wall. The metal felt 
cold, like the window of the car 
on a day when you needed the 
heater and defroster. Was some- 
thing going wrong? 

Maybe they were out of oxygen. 
He listened to Harold snoring. 
Once Harold took a quick breath, 
and strangled, and turned his head 
restlessly. His glasses were slip- 
ping off. 

Orville looked at his watch. He 
couldn't believe that just five 
minutes had gone by since he'd 
looked at it last. He could hear 
Harold's two^dollar watch ticking 
away, almost as loud as his own. 
His was gaining on Harold's and 
then they were ticking together so 
that the combined pounding sent 
echoes through the ship. He tried 
to crawl. 

He couldn't move. 

"Harold!" The ticking of the 
watches drowned out his voice. 
"We're in trouble! We're out of 
oxygen! Help!" 

It was like a bad dream. Then 
something woke him: Harold, 
stumbling across his legs, turning 
on the scope and waiting, breath- 
ing hard, for it to come to life. 

Harold saw that he was awake. 



"You went to sleep! You shoulda 
woke me. It's been six hours!" 

Orville said nothing. 

"We may be clear past the 
Moon by now," Harold grumbled. 

/~\RVTLLE turned his face to 
^-^ the wall. He heard the hiss 
as Harold ran in fresh oxygen. 
"Shoot! Better go down and hook 
up a new tank." Harold clanked 
around in the other end of the 
ship and came back. 

"How far out are we?" asked 
Orville. 

"Not far. I'm cutting down the 
speed some." 

"Uh . . . how do you plan to 
take her down?" 

"That's an interesting point, now. 
Let's see . . ." 

"Wouldn't it be better if we 
just flew up close, not too close, 
and then headed for home? Of 
course, there's that problem back 
there, too." 

"Don't you want the beans? I'll 
eat 'em then." 

"But I'd feel better crashing on 
the Earth, somehow, than on the 
Moon-" 

"Who says we're going to crash? 
There are several ways to set her 
down. Head first, tail first, but I 
guess I'll lay her in sideways. It!ll 
be easier to crawl outside." 

"What?" 

"Sure." Harold was munching 
beans. Then he rummaged in the 
supplies and brought out a jar of 



66 




 



peaches. He drank off some of the 
juice. "Rosie never gets enough 
sugar in these to suit me." The 
peaches slid off the spoon. He dug 
in with his fingers and brought out 
a slice. "Point of the whole thing. 
Explore. Look around." He tilted 
the jar to his mouth and let slices 
fall into his mouth. "Pick up some 
samples of rocks and things." 

"You can get rocks right around 
home." 

"But these are different. These 
weigh only a quarter as much as 
the rocks on Earth. Or is it a 
sixth?" 

"In that case—" Orville started 
gathering up empty bags and cans 
and putting them into a soup car- 
ton. 

"What're you doing?" 

"Cleaning the place up a little. 
We can get rid of some of this 
trash." 

"Don't throw those out! I paid 
a deposit on them." Harold pulled 
out the empty milk bottles and 
put them back in the case. 

Ill 

HAROLD had said the landing 
would be as gentle as laying a 
baby in its cradle. It wasn't exactly. 
He said: "There!" 
"Are we down?" 
Harold nodded. Orville let go 
of the railing he'd been hanging 
onto. Harold unplugged some- 
thing. 



The ship went dark and started 
rolling. It was a slow, drunken 
roll and as noisy as an oil drum 
going down the court house steps. 
There was a final hard blow; then 
the ship rocked and lay still. 

Orville sat up. He could hear 
Harold scrambling about, and 
then a flashlight came on. 

"What happened?" 

"Must have landed on the side 
of a mountain. Rolled down when 
I turned off our counter-grav. 
Shoot!" Harold held up something. 
"Broke a lens in my glasses. 
There's another trip to the eye- 
doctor's." 

Orville rescued a couple of bot- 
tles that were spilling water. Every- 
thing else seemed to be all right. 
The ship lay on its side now and 
Harold was crawling through the 
hole leading to the other compart- 
ment. When Orville got through, 
Harold was hauling something 
from the other end of the ship. 

"What we waiting for?" Or- 
ville put his hand on the handle of 
the outer door. "Last one out is 
a-" 

"Wait a minute! You gotta wear 
this thing." Harold was laying out 
a spacesuit. He explained how it 
worked. He didn't object a great 
deal when Orville volunteered to 
go out first. 

"We can take turns." Harold 
helped Orville slide his feet into 
the thing and pull it on. It fitted 
Orville rather tightly in places, 



FIRST MAN 



67 



but it seemed to be all right. 

"Be careful now." Harold 
squinted at him through the one 
lens of his glasses. "Don't tear her 
on a rock or anything. You'd pop 
like a kid's balloon." 

"Wait a minute!" 

Harold paused, holding the hel- 
met. 

"I can't go through with it," Or- 
ville said. "I was planning a mean 
trick on you. I was going to be 
the first man." 

"What difference does that 
make? We're both in on it to- 
gether." Harold clapped the hel- 
met down on Orville's shoulders. 
He tightened some clamps and 
leaned close and said something 
which Orville could not hear. Then 
Orville saw that he wanted to 
shake hands, so Orville shook his 
hand. 

Harold squirmed back through 
the hole into the nose, waved and 
shut the door. 

/"ORVILLE aimed the flashlight 
^^ at the outer door. He turned 
the valve beside the door, feeling 
the suit puff out around him, and 
when the pressure in the compart- 
ment was gone, he reached toward 
the handle. His eyes were water- 
ing. He had to use all of his 
strength to move the handle; then 
the door popped open, swinging 
out and down, and he was looking 
out at the Moon. 

There was glaring light and a 




68 




 



j&^W&e- 




kind of fog. He laid down the 
flashlight and, groping, found the 
soap carton in which he'd put the 
refuse accumulated during the trip, 
and flung the box into the fog. 

He looked out again. There was 
nothing but the glaring white void. 
"Well, that settles that!" There 
was no use getting out. On the 
other hand, how about a souvenir? 
He stuck a leg out through the 
opening, which was now about two 
feet high and four feet wide. By 
wriggling, he got the other leg out, 
but he couldn't touch the ground. 
He reached his left foot a little 
farther and touched something that 
rolled slightly, then was solid. 
That's far enough, he thought; to 
hell with the souvenir! 

But the mittens were too clumsy. 
He couldn't pull himself back in. 
He lowered himself farther and 
stood. He shuffled among the 
loose, rolling stones and reached 
down and picked one of them up. 
Harold was right: they weighed a 
lot less than the rocks on Earth. 
He cradled the thing in one arm 
and stood there. 

Here he was, standing on the 
Moon! The very first man! He 
hugged the souvenir to his body. 
They'd keep it on the coffee table, 
between those two awful ashtrays 
Polly had brought back from 
Niagara Falls, and when anyone 
asked him what was that funny 
rock lying there, he'd say— 

Orville had been reaching, try- 



FIRST MAN 



69 



ing to touch the ship. His hand 
met nothing . . . 

Now keep calm, he thought. 
Don't get turned around. And don't 
panic. It can't be far away. He 
reached out in another direction 
and took a step, but still his wav- 
ing hand met nothing. Try this 
way then . . . 

As he turned, his elbow struck 
the edge of the opening. Maybe 
he'd been waving his arm through 
the opening all the time! 

He tossed in the souvenir. He 
wriggled in after it. Careful! What 
did Harold say about tearing the 
suit? 

He closed the outer door. As he 
returned the pressure to the com- 
partment, the suit became limp 
against him, and Orville was so 
weak that he sank to the floor. 
He was still lying there when 
Harold took off the headpiece. 

"It's a total flop," Orville told 
him. "It's been a waste of time. 
No use going out." 

TIE told Harold about the nar- 
-" row escape he'd had in the 
fog. Fog on the Moon? This didn't 
sound right to Harold. He was 
fooling with the helmet, scratch- 
ing frost from the inside. of the 
visor. "Couldn't you get the de- 
froster working? This little button 
right here. I showed you." 

Orville knew, to his shame and 
disgust, that he had been looking 
at his own breath all of that time. 



Harold now insisted on going out. 
Orville shined the flashlight around. 
He was looking for the souvenir, 
and he found it, near their feet. 

It was a package carefully 
wrapped in paper, some of the 
refuse which he had thrown out- 
side. 

That figures, he thought bitter- 
ly. Well, anyway, I was first man. 
They can't take that away from 
me! 

Harold was gone a long time. 
The nose of the ship was becom- 
ing very cold and the only light 
came from the luminous dial of 
Orville's watch. What was Harold 
doing out there? Maybe he'd 
snagged his suit and blown up like 
a soap bubble. How long should 
Orville wait before giving up? He 
should have learned how to run 
the ship, in case of an emergency 
like this. 

A distant clank startled him. 
The ship rolled slightly. Orville 
reached out a hand in the dark to 
steady himself and chilled when 
he realized what he'd put his hand 
on. It was the starting switch. 

What was that idiot doing out 
there? 

Then Harold was back, breath- 
ing hard, squinting through his 
one good lens. "Boy, what a sight! 
I'd give anything for a camera!" 

"Never mind that! Let's go! I'm 
freezing!" 

They were off without any 
trouble and the dim violet light

returned and the ice on the com- 
partment walls began to melt. 
When the ship was settled on 
course, Harold took off the rest 
of the spacesuit, pulled some paper 
from the glove compartment of the 
dashboard and began writing. 

"It's the official report," Harold 
said presently. "Getting it all down 
while if s fresh in my mind." 

"Let's see that!" Orville couldn't 
read Harold's handwriting. "What's 
it say?" 

"You really want to hear it? 
Well . . ." Harold cleared his 
throat modestly and began to read. 
"'The Discover/— decided to call 
her the Discovery on account of 
—the Discovery was lying on her 
side in the shade, but a blinding 
light was coming down from some 
peaks. It nearly blinded me! Boy, 
what a—'" Harold squinted over 
a word-" 'sight!'" 

"Wait a minute! You giving me 
credit?" 

'What for?" 

"For being the first man." 

"Oh, sure. I mention that in 
here some place." 

"Just so there's no mistake!" Or- 
ville suddenly felt very drowsy. 
He curled up facing the wall and 
went to sleep. 

When he awoke, he saw Harold 
leaning against the wall, his glasses 
sliding down, his head nodding. 
Orville reached over and jerked 
his foot. 

"There now," he said. "Old 



neighbor. You go to sleep. I'll 
watch her for a while." 

ORVILLE felt fine now. While 
Harold slept, he opened a 
jar of Rosie's peaches, drank off 
the juice and dug in with the 
spoon. It wasn't really so bad, not 
shaving or taking a bath, rough- 
ing it out here in space! 

He dug into his coat pocket, 
found a cigar, but it was crushed. 
Oh, well. He flung it into the trash. 
He folded his arms, leaned back 
his head. 

They sat at the head of a ban- 
quet table, he and Harold. The 
mayor was there, and the college 
president, and way down the table 
was the boss, old Haverstrom, 
real proud to be in such important 
company. And the governor was 
there and — by gosh! Sitting right 
next to Orville was the President 
of the United States! 

Someone was making a speech 
— they were awarding some kind 
of prize for first man and there 
was applause and they were wait- 
ing for Orville to get up. He stood, 
waited for applause to die down. 

"Thank you, friends ... all of 
you . . . being no speechmaker . . . 
but I do want to say right here 
and now ... no more idea of re- 
ceiving this great honor tonight 
than of — flying to the Moon!" 

That would get a laugh. Then 
he'd go on and give due credit 
to Harold, poor old Harold sleep-

ing there, innocent as a baby about 
such things. 

Why, the publicity angle alone 
could take up a man's full time. 
Guest appearances on TV. Get- 
ting signed up as technical adviser 
in Hollywood. But that was just 
the beginning. 

Take the metal in this ship. 
Harold had made it out of junk 
from the city dump, melting it in 
a forge he'd fashioned out of an 
old oil drum. It had to be cheap 
and easy to make — but you 
could probably use it for almost 
anything. There was your whole 
metal industry shot to pieces! 

This thing he called a scope 
now. With a big corporation be- 
hind it, Lord only knew what it 
would do to the communications 
setup. 

But the big thing was this coun- 
ter-grav business! There was where 
you got into the big leagues. If 
Harold could do this with it, think 
what General Motors could do! 
Orville could see TWA, B&O 
and steamship companies bidding 
against each other for it. And car 
manufacturers and freight han- 
dlers — and tugboat owners — and 
taxi fleets— and the armed forces- 
Harold was waking up. He 
rubbed his skimpy whiskers, put 
on his broken glasses, creaked over 
to the scope and turned it on. 
Harold, old boy, Orville thought 
tenderly, you don't know it yet, 
but your troubles are all over! 



"What do you see, Harold?" 

"The Earth." 

Orville went over. There was a 
dark green spot on the scope, 
bright against deep black. "You 
sure?" 

"Almost positive. That's the only 
thing that size there is right around 
here." 

"Well, fine! That calls for a cele- 
bration, doesn't it?" 

"Oh, yes. Forgot that. We can 
open the tuna." 

IV 

??TT'S about time," Orville said, 

-*- "that we started figuring out 
a plan." He scraped the bottom of 
the can. The tuna tasted fine. He 
took a swig of pineapple juice and 
passed the can back to Harold. 

"Yeah, I been thinking about 
that," said Harold. 

"I've had more experience in 
that line than you, so maybe—" 

"Do you think mankind is ready 
for my secret?" 

"There, you see?" Orville 
laughed heartily. "Now don't you 
worry about such things." 

"But look what they did with 
the atomic bomb. And if this ever 
got loose—" 

"Harold!" Orville's laugh was 
less hearty. "Do you think you 
could keep this a secret? The 
minute we land, they'll be all over 
us. The government can impound 
this ship, you know." 



72 




 



'Won't do them any good. They 
can tear it all apart and never find 
out a thing." 

Hours later, they were still argu- 
ing. 

"If the government had it, they'd 
build a war machine and then the 
Russians would steal it—" 

"Harold! Thafs Communist 
talk!" 

"Shoot! I'm no Communist!" 

"You're playing right into their 
hands . . ." 

It went on and on. Then: 
"Harold — as your neighbor — 
won't you tell me what it is?" 

"I'll try . . ." 

Orville sat up, tingling. You 
take gravity, Harold said. What do 
we know about it? Was it like a 
lot of rubber bands, stretching 
back and forth between every- 
thing, or was it a flow, like water? 
Now if it was a flow, it would 
have to flow back some way, or 
else you'd run out, wouldn't you? 
Then if you hooked onto this 
counter-flow— 

Orville nodded. This wasn't so 
hard to understand. He felt a 
little nervous. "Go on, Harold." 

"I guess if s none of those 
things." Harold gave his inane 
giggle. 

Orville felt cheated. "You call 
this neighborly? Remember when 
I drove clear out into the country 
with a gallon of gas that time when 
you got stuck?" 

"I'm trying. You gotta think of 



it up to that point, then you gotta 
think the orher way. But you can*t 
explain it. You just do it." 

HAROLD picked up two of the 
rings from Rosie's fruit jars 
and moved them back and forth 
across one another. He tried with 
three rings, dropped them. 

"If s no use." 

"Try harder." 

Harold shook his head. "I sup- 
pose if I wanted to bad enough . . . 
But now that we been to the 
Moon, there's nothing else I want 
to do." 

Orville reached for the rings and 
tried. 

Suddenly, Harold sprang up. 
"Oh, my socks!" 

He turned on the scope and 
swung it wildly back and forth. 
"You made me commit a boo- 
boo. I think we've shot right past 
the Earth!" 

The scope was getting weak. 
They could not find the Earth 
until Harold had reversed course. 
Then Orville saw it, the edge fil- 
ling part of the scope. Harold's 
eyes were watering. He wiped the 
good lens of his glasses and leaned 
close. 

"Can you make out any land?" 
he asked Orville. 

"This looks like Indian Lake. 
Tve fished there lots of times." 

"It would be something bigger. 
Say, Greenland or South America." 

This was the first time Orville 



FIRST MAN 



73 



realized they might not land 
squarely in Harold's back yard. 
He began looking intently at the 
scope. 

"What's this kidney-bean shape?" 
Harold squinted. "Think thaf s 
Australia. Now we're getting some- 
where." 

"But it belongs down here." 
"We're coming up on it the 
other way." 

"Can't we get closer to home 
than that?" 

"I'll not be too particular where 
it is, just so if s land. The Earth 
is mostly covered with water." 

Harold began turning the knobs 
and muttering. "Let me see 
now . . . gotta miss Mount 
Everest . . ." At last, he turned off 
the scope. "It's clear gone. I'm 
taking her down slow. Will you 
look outside, Orville?" 

Orville gulped. But Harold said 
it was the only way, so he squeezed 
into the other compartment. There 
were now about six of the little 
circles going back and across in- 
side of him. He stood a little to 
one side and struck the lever of 
the outer door sharply with the 
palm of his hand. The door gave 
a faint "swoosh" and was open 
about an inch. His ears crackled 
and there was a dull whispering in 
his hsad like the sound in a sea- 
shell. 

He put his face to the door, 
but saw nothing except the blue 
sky. 



"You sure we came to the right 
place?" he asked worriedly. 

"Positive . . . almost," Harold 
called back. "Are we over land or 
water?" 

Orville looked up. There was a 
brown, black and white landscape. 
Trees hung down like icicles 
around a frozen lake. 

"There's land, but if s upside 
down." 

"Just a minute." Harold did 
something and the trees and land 
swirled around until they were 
underneath. 

TVTOT far away, as they came 
-L^ down gently, Orville saw a 
building with people outside. Or 
he thought they were people. 
Harold set the ship down on its 
side in the snow and Orville 
stepped out. Then Harold was out 
beside him, slapping him on the 
shoulder. 

"Well, old buddy-buddy! How 
about that?" 

"Yeah." Orville spoke with less 
enthusiasm. "How about that?" 

He proposed that they get in 
and ride back to civilization, but 
Harold said there wasn't enough 
power left and it couldn't be done. 
They started walking toward the 
house Orville had seen. 

Halfway there, they met four 
men wearing gray overcoats and 
furry hats. One carried a rifle, and 
as Harold ran shouting up to him, 
the man lifted the rifle and struck 



74 




 



Harold across the head, knocking 
him into the snow and breaking 
the other lens of his glasses. For a 
while, Orville wondered if it was 
the right planet after all. But, he 
decided, the men were Russian 
soldiers somewhere in Siberia. 

Since the men were more in- 
terested in looting the ship than 
guarding the prisoners, it was not 
hard to slip away and get to a 
railroad that ran east and west. 
Even Harold knew which direc- 
tion to take. Their journey out of 
Siberia, through Korea and Japan 
to San Francisco, though more dif- 
ficult than their trip to the Moon, 
was not very interesting. Once, on 
a freighter in mid-Pacific, Harold 
tried to convince a fellow deck- 
hand that they were on their way 
back from the Moon. He agreed 
not to talk of it again. 

"Looks like Rosie's still gone," 
Harold said as they slunk up the 
alley behind Harold's shed. All the 
leaves had fallen and the place 
looked forlorn without the space- 
ship poking up through the roof. 

"Wonder what they thought," 
Orville said, "when the ship dis- 
appeared, and us with it?" 

"Nothing, I expect." 

"If we'd disappeared with a 
couple of blondes now, the whole 
world would know about it." 

THEY parted. The back door 
was locked. As Orville went 
around the house, he heard the 



TV going. Polly sat in the tur- 
quoise armchair, sewing on a dress. 
She put down the sewing and 
folded her arms. 

The oration lasted five minutes. 
He could still hear her upstairs 
through the noise of the shower. 

Then, after a visit to the bar- 
ber's, he went to face old Haver- 
strom. This lecture was not quite 
as long, and through it the boss 
had a trace of a leer, and a cer- 
tain respect, though he let Orville 
know these disappearances should 
not become a habit. 

Harold did not do so well. His 
old job was gone and he was a 
whole week getting another. Rosie 
did not come back for still another 
week. 

It was hard for Orville to be- 
lieve that a moonstruck fellow like 
Harold could change his ways, 
but that was what happened. It 
was as though that one wild trip 
had satisfied something inside 
Harold, for he never fooled with 
things like that again. He even 
joined church. 

As for Orville: some evenings, 
when he reads of artificial satel- 
lites or of trips to the Moon, he 
feels a sharp rise in blood pres- 
sure and he breathes fast. But a 
glance across the room at Polly 
in her turquoise chair sewing is 
enough to make him swallow and 
squirm back and keep his mouth 
shut.

FIRST MAN 



75 



the eel 



BY MIRIAM ALLEN DeFORD 



The punishment had to fit more 
than just the crime — it had to 
suit every world in the Galaxyl 



Illustrated by DILLON 



HE was intimately and 
unfavorably known every- 
where in the Galaxy, 
but with special virulence on 
eight planets in three different 
solar systems. He was eagerly 
sought on each; they all wanted 
to try him and punish him — in 
each case, by their own laws and 
customs. This had been going on 
for 26 terrestrial years, which 
means from minus ten to plus 280 

76 



in some of the others. The only 
place that didn't want him was 
Earth, his native planet, where he 
was too smart to operate — but, 
of course, the Galactic Police were 
looking for him there too, to de- 
liver him to the authorities of the 
other planets in accordance with 
the Interplanetary Constitution. 

For all of those years, The Eel 
(which was his Earth monicker; 
elsewhere, he was known by names 


 



indicating equally squirmy and 
slimy life-forms) had been gayly 
going his way, known under a 
dozen different aliases, turning up 
suddenly here, there, everywhere, 
committing his gigantic depreda- 
tions, and disappearing as quickly 
and silently when his latest enter- 
prise had succeeded. He special- 
ized in enormous, unprecedented 
thefts. It was said that he despised 
stealing anything under the value 
of 100 million terrestrial units, and 
most of his thefts were much larger 
than that. 

He had no recognizable modus 
operandi, changing his methods 
with each new crime. He never 
left a clue. But, in bravado, he 
signed his name to every job: his 
monicker flattered him, and after 
each malefaction the victim— usual- 
ly a government agency, a giant 
corporation, or one of the clan 
enterprises of the smaller planets- 
would receive a message consist- 
ing merely of the impudent depic- 
tion of a large wriggling eel. 

They got him at last, of course. 
The Galactic Police, like the pre- 
historic Royal Canadian Mounted, 
have the reputation of always 
catching their man. (Sometimes 
they don't catch him till he's dead, 
but they catch him.) It took them 
26 years, and it was a hard job, 
for The Eel always worked alone 
and never talked afterward. 

They did it by the herculean 
labor of investigating the source 



of the fortune of every inhabitant 
of Earth, since all that was known 
was that The Eel was a terrestrial. 
Every computer in the Federation 
worked overtime analyzing the 
data fed into it. It wasn't entirely 
a thankless task, for, as a by-prod- 
uct, a lot of embezzlers, tax evad- 
ers and lesser robbers were turned 
up. 

In the end, it narrowed down 
to one man who owned more than 
he could account for having. Even 
so, they almost lost him, for his 
takings were cached away under 
so many pseudonyms that it took 
several months just to establish 
that they all belonged to the same 
person. When that was settled, the 
police swooped. The Eel surren- 
dered quietly; the one thing he 
had been surest of was never be- 
ing apprehended, and he was so 
dumfounded he was unable to put 
up any resistance. 

And then came the still greater 
question: which of the planets was 
to have him? 

XYSTIL said it had the first 
right because his theft there 
had been the largest — a sum so 
huge, it could be expressed only 
by an algebraic index. Artha's ar- 
gument was that his first recorded 
crime had been on that planet. 
Medoris wanted him because its 
only penalty for any felony is an 
immediate and rather horrible 
death, and that would guarantee 



THE EEL 



77 



getting rid of The Eel forever. 

Ceres put in a claim on the 
ground that it was the only planet 
or moon in the Sol System in 
which he had operated, and since 
he was a terrestrial, it was a mat- 
ter for local jurisdiction. Eb 
pleaded that it was the newest and 
poorest member of the Galactic 
Federation, and should have been 
protected in its inexperience against 
his thievishness. 

Ha-Almirath argued that it had 
earned his custody because it was 
its Chief Ruler who had suggested 
to the police the method which 
had resulted in his arrest Vavi- 
nour countered that it should be 
the chosen recipient, since the theft 
there had included desecration of 
the High Temple. 

Little Agsk, which was only a 
probationary Galactic Associate, 
modestly said that if it were given 
The Eel, its prompt and exemplary 
punishment might qualify it for 
full membership, and it would be 
grateful for the chance. 

A special meeting of the Galac- 
tic Council had to be called for 
the sole purpose of deciding who 
got The Eel. 

Representatives of all the claim- 
ant planets made their representa- 
tions. Each told in eloquent detail 
why his planet and his alone was 
entitled to custody of the arch- 
criminal, and what they would do 
to him when — not if — they got 
him. After they had all been heard, 



the councilors went into executive 
session, with press and public 
barred. An indiscreet councilor (it 
was O-Al of Phlagon of Altair, if 
you want to know) leaked later 
some of the rather indecorous pro- 
ceedings. 

The Earth councilor, he re- 
ported, had been granted a voice 
but no vote, since Earth was not 
an interested party as to the crime, 
but only as to the criminal. Every 
possible system of arbitration had 
been discussed — chronological, nu- 
merical in respect to the size of the 
theft, legalistic in respect to 
whether the culprit would be avail- 
able to hand on to another victim 
when the first had got through 
punishing him. 

In the welter of claims and coun- 
terclaims, one harassed councilor 
wearily suggested a lottery. An- 
other in desperation recommended 
handling The Eel a list of prospec- 
tive punishments on each of the 
eight planets and observing which 
one seemed to inspire him with 
most dread — which would then 
be the one selected. One even pro- 
posed poisoning him and announc- 
ing his sudden collapse and death. 

The sessions went on day and 
night; the exhausted councilors 
separated for brief periods of sleep, 
then went at it again. A hung jury 
was unthinkable; something had 
to be decided. The news outlets of 
the entire Galaxy were beginning 
to issue sarcastic editorials about 



78 




 



procrastination and coddling crimi- 
nals, with hints about bribery and 
corruption, and remarks that per- 
haps what was needed was a few 
impeachments and a new general 
election. 

So at last, in utter despair, they 
awarded The Eel to Agsk, as a 
sort of bonus and incentive. Which- 
ever planet they named, the other 
seven were going to scream to high 
heaven, and Agsk was least likely 
to be able to retaliate against any 
expressions of indignation. 

A GSKIANS, as everyone knows, 
•**- are fairly humanoid beings, 
primitives from the outer edge of 
the Galaxy. They were like, col- 
lege freshmen invited to a senior 
fraternity. This was their Big 
Chance to Make Good. 

The Eel, taciturn as ever, was 
delivered to a delegation of six 
of them sent to meet him in one 
of their lumbering spaceships, a 
low countergrav machine such as 
Earth had outgrown several mil- 
lennia before. They were so afraid 
of losing him that they put a metal 
belt around him with six chains 
attached to it, and fastened all 
six of themselves to him. Once on 
Agsk, he was placed in a specially 
made stone pit, surrounded by 
guards, and fed through the only 
opening. 

In preparation for the influx of 
visitors to the trial, an anticipated 
greater assembly of off-planeters 



than little Agsk had ever seen, they 
evacuated their capital city tem- 
porarily, resettling all its citizens 
except those needed to serve and 
care for the guests, and remodeled 
the biggest houses for the accom- 
modation of those who had pecul- 
iar space, shape, or other require- 
ments. 

Never since the Galactic Federa- 
tion was founded had so many 
beings, human, humanoid, semi- 
humanoid and non-humanoid, gath- 
ered at the same time on any one 
member-planet. Every newstape, 
tridimens, audio and all" other vari- 
eties of information services— even 
including the drum amplifiers of 
Medoris and the ray-variants of 
Eb — applied for and were granted 
a place in the courtroom. This, 
because no other edifice was 
large enough, was an immense 
stone amphitheater usually de- 
voted to rather curious games with 
animals; since it rains on Agsk 
only for two specified hours on 
every one of their days, no roof 
was needed. At every seat, there 
was a translatophone, with inter- 
preters ready in plastic cages to 
translate the Intergalactic in which 
the trial was conducted into even 
the clicks and hisses of Jorg and 
the eye-flashes of Omonro. 

And in the midst of all this, the 
cause and purpose of it all, sat 
the legendary Eel. 

Seen at last, he was hardly an 
impressive figure. Time had been 



THE EEL 



79 



going on and The Eel was in his 
fifties, bald and a trifle paunchy. 
He was completely ordinary in 
appearance, a circumstance which 
had, of course, enabled him to pass 
unobserved on so many planets; 
he looked like a salesman or a 
minor official, and had indeed been 
so taken by the unnoticing inhabi- 
tants of innumerable planets. 

People had wondered, when 
word came of some new outrage 
by this master-thief, if perhaps he 
had disguised himself as a resident 
of the scene of each fresh crime, 
but now it was obvious that this 
had not been necessary. He had 
been too clever to pick any planet 
where visitors from Earth were 
not a common sight, and he had 
been too insignificant for anyone 
to pay attention to him. 

THHE criminal code of Agsk is 
«*• unique in the Galaxy, though 
there are rumors of something sim- 
ilar among a legendary extinct 
tribe on Earth called the Guanches. 
The high priest is also the chief 
executive (as well as the minister 
of education and head of the medi- 
cal faculty), and he rules jointly 
with a priestess who also officiates 
as chief judge. 

The Agskians have some strange 
ideas to a terrestrial eye — for 
example, suicide is an honor, and 
anyone of insufficient rank who 
commits it condemns his imme- 
diate family to punishment for his 



presumption. They are great fam- 
ily people, in general. Also, they 
never lie, and find it hard to realize 
that other beings do. 

Murder, to them, is merely a 
matter for negotiation between the 
murderer and the relatives of the 
victim, provided it is open and 
without deceit. But grand larceny, 
since property is the foundation of 
the family, is punished in a way 
that shows that the Agskians, 
though technologically primitive, 
are psychologically very advanced. 

They reason that death, because 
it comes inevitably to all, is the 
least of misfortunes. Lasting grief, 
remorse and guilt are the greatest. 
So they let the thief live and do 
not even imprison him. 

Instead, they find out who it is 
that the criminal most loves. If 
they do not know who it is, they 
merely ask him, and since Agskians 
never lie, he always tells them. 
Then they seize that person, and 
kill him or her, slowly and pain- 
fully, before the thief s eyes. 

And the agreement had been 
that The Eel was to be tried and 
punished by the laws and customs 
of the planet to which he was 
awarded. 

The actual trial and conviction 
of The Eel were almost perfunc- 
tory. Without needing to resort to 
torture, his jailers had been pre- 
sented, on a platter as it were, with 
a full confession — so far as the 
particular robbery he had com- 



80 




 



mitted on Agsk was concerned. 
There is a provision for defense in 
the Agskian code, but it was un- 
needed because The Eel had 
pleaded guilty. 

But he knew very well he would 
not be executed by the Agskians; 
he would instead be set free (pre- 
sumably with a broken heart) to 
be handed over to the next claim- 
ant—and that, the Council had de- 
cided, would be Medoris. Since 
Medoris always kills its criminals, 
that would end the whole contro- 
versy. 

So the Eel was quite aware that 
his conviction by Agsk would be 
only the preliminary to an ex- 
quisitely painful and lingering de- 
mise at the two-clawed hands of 
the Medorans. His business was 
somehow to get out from under. 

Naturally, the resources of the 
Galactic Police had been at the 
full disposal of the officials of 
Agsk. 

The files had been opened, 
and the Agskians had before them 
The Eel's history back to the day 
of his birth. He himself had been 
questioned, encelographed, hypno- 
tized, dormitized, injected, psycho- 
graphed, subjected to all the means 
of eliciting information devised by 
all eight planets — for the other 
seven, once their first resentment 
was over, had reconciled them- 
selves and cooperated whole- 
heartedly with Agsk. 

Medoris especially had been of 



the greatest help. The Medorans 
could hardly wait. 

IN the spate of news of the trial 
-■- that inundated every portion of 
the Galaxy, there began to be dis- 
covered a note of sympathy for this 
one little creature arrayed against 
the mightiest powers of the Galaxy. 
Poor people who wished they had 
his nerve, and romantic people who 
dreamed of adventures they would 
never dare perform, began to say 
that The Eel wasn't so bad, after 
all; he became a symbol of the 
rebellious individual thumbing his 
nose at entrenched authority. Stu- 
dents of Earth prehistory will 
recognize such symbols in the 
mythical Robin Hood and Al 
Capone. 

These were the people who were 
glad to put up when bets began 
to be made. At first the odds were 
ten to one against The Eel; then, 
as time dragged by, they dropped 
until it was even money. 

Agsk itself began to be worried. 
It was one thing to make a big, 
expensive splurge to impress the 
Galaxy and to hasten its accep- 
tance into full membership in the 
Federation, but nobody had ex- 
pected the show to last more than 
a few days. If it kept on much 
longer, Agsk would be bankrupt. 

For the trial had foundered on 
one insoluble problem: the only 
way The Eel could ever be pun- 
ished by their laws was to kill the

person he most loved — and no- 
body could discover that he had 
ever loved anybody. 

His mother? His father? He had 
been an undutiful and unaffec- 
tionate son, and his parents were 
long since dead in any case. He 
had never had a brother, a sister, 
a wife or a child. No probing could 
find any woman with whom he had 
ever been in love. He had never 
had an intimate friend. 

He did nothing to help, natu- 
rally. He simply sat in his chains 
and smiled and waited. He was 
perfectly willing to be escorted 
from the court every evening, re- 
lieved of his fetters and placed in 
his pit. It was a much pleasanter 
existence than being executed inch 
by inch by the Medorans. For all 
he cared, the Agskians could go 
on spending their planetary income 
until he finally died of old age. 

The priestess-judge and her co- 
adjutors wore themselves out in 
discussions far into the night. They 
lost up to 15 pounds apiece, which 
on Agsk, where the average weight 
of adults is about 40, was serious. 
It began to look as if The Eel's 
judges would predecease him. 

Whom did The Eel love? They 
went into minutiae and subter- 
fuges. He had never had a pet to 
which he was devoted. He had 
never even loved a house which 
could be razed. He could not be 
said to have loved the immense 
fortune he had stolen, for he had 



concealed his wealth and used little 
of it, and in any event it had all 
been confiscated and, so far as 
possible, restored proportionately 
to those he had robbed. 

What he had loved most, doubt- 
less, was his prowess in stealing 
unimaginable sums and getting 
away with it — but there is no way 
of "killing" a criminal technique. 

ALMOST a year had passed. 
Agsk was beginning to wish 
The Eel had never been caught, or 
that they had never been awarded 
the glory of trying him. 

At last the priestess-judge, in 
utter despair, took off her judge's 
robes, put on the cassock and sur- 
plice of her sacred calling, and 
laid the problem before the most 
unapproachable and august of the 
gods of Agsk. 

The trial was suspended while 
she lay for three days in a trance 
on the high altar. She emerged 
weak and tottering, her skin light 
blue instead of its healthy purple, 
but her head high and her mouth 
curved in triumph. 

At sight of her, renewed excite- 
ment surged through the audience. 
News-gatherers, who had been find- 
ing it difficult of late to get any- 
thing to report, rushed to their 
instruments. 

"Remove the defendant's chains 
and set him free," the priestess- 
judge ordered in ringing tones. 
"The Great God of the Unspeak- 



THE EEL 



83 



able Name has revealed to me 
whom the defendant most loves. 
As soon as he is freed, seize him 
and slay him. For the only being 
he loves is— himself." 

There was an instant's silence, 
and then a roar. The Medorans 
howled in frustration. 

But The Eel, still guarded but 
unchained, stood up and laughed 
aloud. 

"Your Great God is a fool!" he 
said blasphemously. "I deny that 
I love myself. I care nothing for 
myself at all." 

The priestess-judge sighed. 
"Since this is your sworn denial, 
it must be true," she said. "So 
then we cannot kill you. Instead, 
we grant that you do indeed love 
no one. Therefore you are a crea- 
ture so far outside our comprehen- 
sion that you cannot come under 
our laws, no matter how you have 
broken them. We shall notify the 
Federation that we abandon our 
jurisdiction and hand you over to 
our sister-planet which is next in 
line to judge you." 

Then all the viewers on tridi- 
mens on countless planets saw 
something that nobody had ever 
thought to see - The Eel's armor 
of self-confidence cracked and ter- 
ror poured through the gap. 

He dropped to his knees and 
cried: "Wait! Wait! I confess that 
I blasphemed your god, but with- 
out realizing that I did!" 

"You mean," pressed the priest- 



ess-judge, "you acknowledge that 
you yourself are the only being 
dear to you?" 

"No, not that, either. Until now, 
I have never known love. But now 
it has come upon me like a nova 
and I must speak the truth." He 
paused, still on his knees, and 
looked piteously at the priestess- 
judge. "Are — are you bound by 
your law to — to believe me and 
to kill, instead of me, this — this 
being I adore?" 

"We are so bound," she stated. 

"Then," said The Eel, smiling 
and confident again, rising to his 
feet, "before all the Galaxy, I must 
declare the object of my sudden 
but everlasting passion. Great lady, 
it is you!" 

'T'HE Eel is still in his pit, which 
-■- has been made most comfort- 
able by his sympathizers, while the 
Council of the Galactic Federation 
seeks feverishly and vainly, year 
after year, to find some legal way 
out of the impasse. 

Agsk, however, requests all Fed- 
eration citizens to submit solu- 
tions, the grand prize for a work- 
able answer being a lifetime term 
as president of the planet. A sec- 
ondary contest (prize: lifetime 
ambassadorship to the Galactic 
Federation) is offered for a legal 
way around the statute barring 
criminals (specifically The Eel) 
from entering the primary contest.

works in its field, it holds its unique 
position against all latecomers. Let 
me put it this way — the book 
couldn't have chosen a better au-

The same blind devotion, utter

SEA SIEGE by Andre Norton. 
Harcourt, Brace and Co., N. Y., 
$3.00

T^RANKLY, Miss Norton's latest 
-■- book is difficult to evaluate 
from a juvenile viewpoint. At vir- 
tually no time is the young hero 
master of his own destiny. He is 
carried along by forces beyond 
his control. Far from a failing to 
me, but I can't say — I'm no kid any 
more. 

Griffith Gunston, an American 
youth, is unhappily stationed on 
San Isadore, a bleak British West 
Indian island with his ichthyolo- 
gist father, who is studying a red 
radioactive scum that is killing 
millions of fish. 

The scum and the disappear- 
ances of crews of sailing vessels 
a la Marie Celeste are unofficial- 
ly attributed to the Russians, but 
the natives credit devils, particu- 
larly after an unclassifiable mon- 
ster is washed up on the beach. 
In addition, deadly stonefish ap- 
pearing half a world away from 
their normal habitat, and octopi 
suddenly more organized and per- 
ceptive, add to the islanders' fears. 
They come close to rebellion dur- 
ing the establishment of a secret 
American naval base. 

Midway through the book, the 
island is isolated by atomic war- 
fare between East and West. Basic 
survival becomes paramount. 
Flood, fallout and earthquake are 
major enemies. 

At no time does Miss Norton 
soften her stark picture of an island 
in torment and people in travail. 



That's why I hesitate. Juvenile? 
Maybe so, but absorbing adult fare, 
also. 

RADIATION by Jack Schubert, 
Ph.D., and Ralph E. Lapp, Ph.D. 
Viking Press, N. Y., $3.95 

T RECOMMENDED recently 
•■■ that On The Beach, a work of 
fiction, be made required reading 
for mankind's policy-makers. The 
same should hold for this authori- 
tative book, which dispels innu- 
merable illusions that you, I and 
certainly They have concerning 
radiation. If anyone can read it 
with equanimity, then he is either 
hermit or Hottentot. 

Subtitled "What it is and how it 
affects you," the book treats of 
the obvious, the A- and H-bombs 
and the less obvious, more insidi- 
ous, the X-ray and fluoroscope. It 
tells of the frightful results of the 
frivolous use of X-rays for depila- 
tion in the '20's, the well-known 
cases of poisoning in the watchdial 
factories and the less publicized 
cases resulting from careless fluor- 
oscopy. It warns of the dangers of 
the new radioisotopes and ill-ad- 
vised radiation therapy. 

In short, Schubert and Lapp 
have done an eye-opening job. It 
should reach the right eyes.

ALTHOUGH not ostensibly a 
fantasy, this account of a sum- 
mer in the life of a twelve-year- 
old boy can hardly be anything 
else, as anyone who ever was a 
twelve-year-old will agree. While 
there are those who condemn 
Bradbury for his frequent nostal- 
gic excursions into adolescence, it 
must be agreed that he knows the 
wonderful workings of child minds 
better than most writers since 
Twain and Tarkington. 

Douglas Spalding and younger 
brother Tom are the central fig- 
ures, but entire episodes are woven 
about others: Grandpa and the 
lawn-mower; the death of Great- 
grandma; Grandma and her rule- 
of-thumb cookery. For sheer fan- 
tasy, there is jeweler Leo Auff- 
mann's near-tragic invention of the 
Happiness Machine, and Charlie 
Woodman's honest - to - goodness 
Time Machine. 

Admirers of Bradbury will wel- 
come this tender volume and even 
his decriers will find passages of 
pure evocative magic to soften 
their flinty hearts. 

MODERN APPLIED PHOTOG- 
RAPHY by G. A. Jones. Philo- 
sophical Library, TV. Y., $4.75 

THE average citizen looks upon 
photography as an instrument 
of enjoyment or communication, 
but seldom as a technical tool. 
However, photography has become 



so much a part of research that 
it is impossible to visualize cer- 
tain sciences without it. Virtually 
no visual observation is carried 
out in astronomy except by ama- 
teurs. Infra-red, ultra-violet, X- 
ray, spectrograph^ and micropho- 
tography are integral parts of nu- 
merous sciences. 

Jones' book dramatizes the im- 
portance of a versatile and im- 
mensely important art. 

THE NEXT FIFTY BILLION 
YEARS by Kenneth Heuer. Vik- 
ing Press, N. Y., $3.00 

HEUER is a Fellow of the RAS 
and for five years lecturer 
at the Hayden Planetarium. He 
has revised an earlier book titled 
The End of the World, material 
for which he took mainly from the 
most popular theme of the same 
name at the planetarium. The 
present volume is considerably 
more optimistic, hence the change 
of title. 

Various possible finishes to the 
Earth envisioned are cosmic col- 
lisions, death of the Moon, kid- 
napping of Earth by another sun, 
a white dwarf star approaching too 
close, the Sun becoming a nova, 
and the death of the Sun. How- 
ever, as you can see by the title, 
Heuer foresees a long, if not hap- 
py, tomorrow for us if we don't 
do something rash today.

PEOPLE MINUS X by Ray- 
mond Z. Gallun. Simon and 
Schuster, N. Y., $3.00 

r F s O oldtimers, Gallun is a con- 
■*• juring name. His "Old Faith- 
ful" remains a classic in the field 
to this day. Unfortunately, he is 
also capable of turning out an in- 
credibly bad story, as here. 

His theme is natural human 
against android, but he has added 
a new touch. In the event of an 
individual's destruction, his body 
can be perfectly reproduced from 
an original pattern, thus circum- 
venting death. If the pattern is 
destroyed, he can be reproduced 
from the memories of family and 
friends. 

This makes for interesting plot 
possibilities, since no man is the 



same to any two associates but, 
aside from a brief and unsatis- 
factorily melodramatic use of this 
potentially amusing or dramatic 
device, Gallun employs as dated 
and artificial a plot as anything 
from the antediluvian days of SF. 
The Moon has blown up in an 
enormous cataclysm as a result of 
dangerous experiments being con- 
ducted there. The only scientist of 
note to escape is the discoverer of 
the process of artificial reproduc- 
tion. An enormous segment of 
Earth's population is destroyed 
although most are replaceable due 
to his discovery. Meanwhile, hu- 
manity has reacted with a psy- 
chopathic hatred of scientists, so 
that he is forced into hiding. 

There are the seeds of a good 
yarn scattered throughout, but Gal- 
lun has done an almost complete 
job of plowing under the harvest.

Old Rambling Hous 

By FRANK HERBERT 

All the Grahams desired was a 
home they could call their own 
. • • but what did the home want? 

Illustrated by JOHNSON 



ON his last night on Earth, 
Ted Graham stepped out 
of a glass-walled tele- 
phone booth, ducked to avoid a 
swooping moth that battered itself 
in a frenzy against a bare globe 
above the booth. 

Ted Graham was a long-necked 
man with a head of pronounced 
egg shape topped by prematurely 
balding sandy hair. Something 
about his lanky, intense appear- 
ance suggested his occupation : cer- 



tified public accountant. 

He stopped behind his wife, 
who was studying a newspaper 
classified page, and frowned. 
"They said to wait here. They'll 
come get us. Said the place is hard 
to find at night." 

Martha Graham looked up from 
the newspaper. She was a doll- 
faced woman, heavily pregnant, a 
kind of pink prettiness about her. 
The yellow glow from the light 
above the booth subdued the red-

auburn cast of her ponytail hair. 

"I just have to be in a house 
when the baby's born," she said. 
"What'd they sound like?" 

"I dunno. There was a funny 
kind of interruption— like an ar- 
gument in some foreign language." 

"Did they sound foreign?" 

"In a way." He motioned along 
the night-shrouded line of trailers 
toward one with two windows 
glowing amber. "Let's wait inside. 
These bugs out here are fierce." 

"Did you tell them which trailer 
is ours?" 

"Yes. They didn't sound at all 
anxious to look at it. That's odd— 
them wanting to trade their house 
for a trailer." 

"There's nothing odd about it. 
They've probably just got itchy 
feet like we did." 

He appeared not to hear her. 
"Funniest-sounding language you 
ever heard when that argument 
started— like a squirt of noise." 

I NSIDE the trailer, Ted Graham 
-■- sat down on the green couch 
that opened into a double bed for 
company. 

"They could use a good tax ac- 
countant around here," he said. 
"When I first saw the place, I got 
that definite feeling. The valley 
looks prosperous. It's a wonder 
nobody's opened an office here 
before." 

His wife took a straight chair 
by the counter separating kitchen 



and living area, folded her hands 
across her heavy stomach. 

"I'm just continental tired of 
wheels going around under me," 
she said. "I want to sit and stare 
at the same view for the rest of 
my life. I don't know how a trailer 
ever seemed glamorous when—" 

"It was the inheritance gave us 
itchy feet," he said. 

Tires gritted on gravel outside. 

Martha Graham straightened. 
"Could that be them?" 

"Awful quick, if it is." He went 
to the door, opened it, stared down 
at the man who was just raising 
a hand to knock. 

"Are you Mr. Graham?" asked 
the man. 

"Yes." He found himself star- 
ing at the caller. 

"I'm Clint Rush. You called 
about the house?" The man moved 
farther into the light. At first, he'd 
appeared an old man, fine wrinkle 
lines in his face, a tired leather look 
to his skin. But as he moved his 
head in the light, the wrinkles 
seemed to dissolve— and with them, 
the years lifted from him. 

"Yes, we called," said Ted 
Graham. He stood aside. "Do you 
want to look at the trailer now?" 

Martha Graham crossed to 
stand beside her husband. "We've 
kept it in awfully good shape," she 
said. "We've never let anything 
get seriously wrong with it." 

She sounds too anxious, thought 
Ted Graham. / wish she'd let me

do the talking for the two of us. 

"We can come back and look 
at your trailer tomorrow in day- 
light," said Rush. "My car's right 
out here, if you'd like to see our 
house." 

Ted Graham hesitated. He felt 
a nagging worry tug at his mind, 
tried to fix his attention on what 
bothered him. 

"Hadn't we better take our 
car?" he asked. "We could follow 
you." 

"No need," said Rush. "We're 
coming back into town tonight 
anyway. We can drop you off 
then." 

Ted Graham nodded. "Be right 
with you as soon as I lock up." 

Inside the car, Rush mumbled 
introductions. His wife was a dark 
shadow in the front seat, her hair 
drawn back in a severe bun. Her 
features suggested gypsy blood. He 
called her Raimee. 

Odd name, thought Ted Gra- 
ham. And he noticed that she, too, 
gave that strange first impression 
of age that melted in a shift of 
light. 

Mrs. Rush turned her gypsy 
features toward Martha Graham. 
"You are going to have a baby?" 

It came out as an odd, veiled 
statement. 

Abruptly, the car rolled forward. 

Martha Graham said, "It's sup- 
posed to be born in about two 
months. We hope it's a boy." 

Mrs. Rush looked at her hus- 



band. "I have changed my mind," 
she said. 

Rush spoke without taking his 
attention from the road. "It is 
too . . ." He broke off, spoke in 
a tumble of strange sounds. 

Ted Graham recognized it as 
the language he'd heard on the 
telephone. 

Mrs. Rush answered in the same 
tongue, anger showing in the in- 
tensity of her voice. Her husband 
replied, his voice calmer. 

Presently, Mrs. Rush fell mood- 
ily silent. 

Rush tipped his head toward 
the rear of the car. "My wife has 
moments when she does not want 
to get rid of the old house. It has 
been with her for many years." 

Ted Graham said, "Oh." Then: 
"Are you Spanish?" 

Rush hesitated. "No. We are 
Basque." 

He turned the car down a well- 
lighted avenue that merged into a 
highway. They turned onto a side 
road. There followed more turns- 
left, right, right. 

Ted Graham lost track. 

They hit a jolting bump that 
made Martha gasp. 

"I hope that wasn't too rough 
on you," said Rush. "We're almost 
there." 

r ¥ 1 HE car swung into a lane, its 
-*- lights picking out the skeleton 
outlines of trees: peculiar trees- 
tall, gaunt, leafless. They added to 



OLD RAMBLING HOUSE 



91 



Ted Graham's feeling of uneasi- 
ness. 

The lane dipped, ended at a low 
wall of a house— red brick with 
clerestory windows beneath over- 
hanging eaves. The effect of the 
wall and a wide-beamed door they 
could see to the left was ultra- 
modern. 

Ted Graham helped his wife out 
of the car, followed the Rushes to 
the door. 

"I thought you told me it was 
an old house," he said. 

"It was designed by one of the 
first modernists," said Rush. He 
fumbled with an odd curved key. 
The wide door swung open onto 
a hallway equally wide, carpeted 
by a deep pile rug. They could 
glimpse floor-to-ceiling view win- 
dows at the end of the hall, city 
lights beyond. 

Martha Graham gasped, en- 
tered the hall as though in a trance. 
Ted Graham followed, heard the 
door close behind them. 

"It's so— so— so big" exclaimed 
Martha Graham. 

"You want to trade this for our 
trailer?" asked Ted Graham. 

"It's too inconvenient for us," 
said Rush. "My work is over the 
mountains on the coast." He 
shrugged. "We cannot sell it." 

Ted Graham looked at him 
sharply. "Isn't there any money 
around here?" He had a sudden 
vision of a tax accountant with no 
customers. 



"Plenty of money, but no real 
estate customers." 

They entered the living room. 
Sectional divans lined the walls. 
Subdued lighting glowed from the 
corners. Two paintings hung on 
the opposite walls— oblongs of odd 
lines and twists that made Ted 
Graham dizzy. 

Warning bells clamored in his 
mind. 

Tt/fARTHA Graham crossed to 
-*-" the windows, looked at the 
lights far away below. "I had no 
idea we'd climbed that far," she 
said. "It's like a fairy city." 

Mrs. Rush emitted a short, nerv- 
ous laugh. 

Ted Graham glanced around the 
room, thought: If the rest of the 
house is like this, ifs worth fifty 
or sixty thousand. He thought of 
the trailer: A good one, but not 
worth more than seven thousand. 

Uneasiness was like a neon sign 
flashing in his mind. "This seems 
so ... " He shook his head. 

"Would you like to see the rest 
of the house?" asked Rush. 

Martha Graham turned from 
the window. "Oh, yes." 

Ted Graham shrugged. No harm 
in looking, he thought. 

When they returned to the liv- 
ing room, Ted Graham had 
doubled his previous estimate on 
the house's value. His brain reeled 
with the summing of it: a solarium 
with an entire ceiling covered by 



92 




 



sun lamps, an automatic laundry 
where you dropped soiled clothing 
down a chute, took it washed and 
ironed from the other end . . . 

"Perhaps you and your wife 
would like to discuss it in private," 
said Rush. "We will leave you for 
a moment." 

And they were gone before Ted 
Graham could protest. 

Martha Graham said, "Ted, I hon- 
estly never in my life dreamed—" 

"Something's very wrong, honey." 

"But, Ted-" 

"This house is worth at least a 
hundred thousand dollars. Maybe 
more. And they want to trade 
this—' he looked around him— "for 
a seven-thousand-dollar trailer?" 

"Ted, they're foreigners. And if 
they're so foolish they don't know 
the value of this place, then why 
should-" 

"I don't like it," he said. Again 
he looked around the room, re- 
called the fantastic equipment of 
the house. "But maybe you're 
right." 

He stared out at the city lights. 
They had a lacelike quality: tall 
buildings linked by lines of flick- 
ering incandescence. Something 
like a Roman candle shot skyward 
in the distance. 

"Okay!" he said. "If they want 
to trade, let's go push the deal . . ." 

Abruptly, the house shuddered. 
The city lights blinked out. A hum- 
ming sound filled the air. 

Martha Graham clutched her 



husband's arm. "Ted! Wha— what 
was that?" 

"I dunno." He turned. "Mr. 
Rush!" 

No answer. Only the humming. 

The door at the end of the room 
opened. A strange man came 
through it. He wore a short toga- 
like garment of gray, metallic 
cloth belted at the waist by some- 
thing that glittered and shimmered 
through every color of the spec- 
trum. An aura of coldness and 
power emanated from him— a sense 
of untouchable hauteur. 

TTE glanced around the room, 
■■"■- spoke in the same tongue the 
Rushes had used. 

Ted Graham said, "I don't un- 
derstand you, mister." 

The man put a hand to his flick- 
ering belt. Both Ted and Martha 
Graham felt themselves rooted to 
the floor, a tingling sensation vi- 
brating along every nerve. 

Again the strange language 
rolled from the man's tongue, but 
now the words were understood. 

"Who are you?" 

"My name's Graham. This is 
my wife. What's going—" 

"How did you get here?" 

"The Rushes— they wanted to 
trade us this house for our trailer. 
They brought us. Now look, we—" 

"What is your talent— your oc- 
cupation?" 

"Tax accountant. Say! Why all 
these-" 



OLD RAMBLING HOUSE

"That was to be expected," said 
the man. "Clever! Oh, excessively 
clever!" His hand moved again to 
the belt. "Now be very quiet. This 
may confuse you momentarily ." 

Colored lights filled both the 
Grahams' minds. They staggered. 

"You are qualified," said the 
man. "You will serve." 

"Where are we?" demanded 
Martha Graham. 

"The coordinates would not be 
intelligible to you," he said. "I am 
of the Rojac. It is sufficient for 
you to know that you are under 
Rojac sovereignty." 

HTED Graham said, "But-" 
■*- "You have, in a way, been kid- 
napped. And the Raimees have 
fled to your planet— an unregis- 
tered planet." 

"I'm afraid," Martha Graham 
said shakily. 

"You have nothing to fear," said 
the man. "You are no longer on 
the planet of your birth— nor even 
in the same galaxy." He glanced 
at Ted Graham's wrist. "That de- 
vice on your wrist— it tells your 
local time?" 

"Yes." 

"That will help in the search. 
And your sun— can you describe 
its atomic cycle?" 

Ted Graham groped in his mind 
for his science memories from 
school, from the Sunday supple- 
ments. "I can recall that our galaxy 
is a spiral like—" 



"Most galaxies are spiral." 

"Is this some kind of a practical 
joke?" asked Ted Graham. 

The man smiled, a cold, superior 
smile. "It is no joke. Now I will 
make you a proposition." 

Ted nodded warily. "All right, 
let's have the stinger." 

"The people who brought you 
here were tax collectors we Rojac 
recruited from a subject planet. 
They were conditioned to make it 
impossible for them to leave their 
job untended. Unfortunately, they 
were clever enough to realize that 
if they brought someone else in 
who could do their job, they were 
released from their mental bonds. 
Very clever." 

"But-" 

"You may have their job," said 
the man. "Normally, you would 
be put to work in the lower eche- 
lons, but we believe in meting out 
justice wherever possible. The 
Raimees undoubtedly stumbled on 
your planet by accident and lured 
you into this position without—" 

"How do you know I can do 
your job?" 

"That moment of brilliance was 
an aptitude test. You passed. Well, 
do you accept?" 

"What about our baby?" Mar- 
tha Graham worriedly wanted to 
know. 

"You will be allowed to keep it 
until it reaches the age of decision 
—about the time it will take the 
child to reach adult stature." 



94 




 




OLD RAMBLING HOUSE

"Then what?" insisted Martha 
Graham. 

"The child will take its position 
in society— according to its ability." 

"Will we ever see our child 
after that?" 

"Possibly." 

Ted Graham said, "What's the 
joker in this?" 

Again the cold, superior smile. 
"You will receive conditioning 
similar to that which we gave the 
Raimees. And we will want to 
examine your memories to aid us 
in our search for your planet. It 
would be good to find a new in- 
habitable place." 

"Why did they trap us like 
this?" asked Martha Graham. 

"It's lonely work," the man ex- 
plained. "Your house is actually a 
type of space conveyance that 
travels along your collection route 
—and there is much travel to the 
job. And then— you will not have 
friends, nor time for much other 
than work. Our methods are neces- 
sarily severe at times." 

"Travel?" Martha Graham re- 
peated in dismay. 

"Almost constantly." 

Ted Graham felt his mind whirl- 
ing. And behind him, he heard his 
wife sobbing. 

THE Raimees sat in what had 
been the Grahams' trailer. 
"For a few moments, I feared 
he would not succumb to the bait," 



she said. "I knew you could never 
overcome the mental compulsion 
enough to leave them there with- 
out their first agreeing." 

Raimee chuckled. "Yes. And 
now I'm going to indulge in every- 
thing the Rojac never permitted. 
I'm going to write ballads and 
poems." 

"And I'm going to paint," she 
said. "Oh, the delicious freedom!" 

"Greed won this for us," he said. 
"The long study of the Grahams 
paid off. They couldn't refuse to 
trade." 

"I knew they'd agree. The looks 
in their eyes when they saw the 
house! They both had . . ." She 
broke off, a look of horror coming 
into her eyes. "One of them did 
not agree!" 

"They both did. You heard 
them." 

"The baby?" 

He stared at his wife. "But— 
but it is not at the age of decision!" 

"In perhaps eighteen of this 
planet's years, it will be at the 
age of decision. What then?" 

His shoulders sagged. He shud- 
dered. "I will not be able to fight 
it off. I will have to build a trans- 
mitter, call the Rojac and confess!" 

"And they will collect another 
inhabitable place," she said, her 
voice flat and toneless. 

"I've spoiled it," he said. "I've 
spoiled it!"

the average — his reading covers 
everything scientific, social, politi- 
cal, economic and what not, mined 
for him by perhaps the sharpest 
researchers in the world. 

The development of a theme 
into a story is done by extrapola- 
tion. That's a clumsy and forbid- 
ding word; I hope somebody can 
offer a neater, more easily under- 
stood one. It's the process of 
carrying out data to the most 
ultimate and logical conclusion 
possible, and is used by economists, 
statisticians— yourself, for that mat- 
ter, if you have to file a report of 
estimated income with the Bu- 
reau of Internal Revenue. Of 
course the average science fiction 
reader is shrewder at extrapola- 
tion than the average — he's been 
guided and stimulated by perhaps 
the best in the world. 

Resourcefully imaginative re- 
search and daringly creative ex- 
trapolation, these are two of the 
qualities that make science fiction 
a prime recruiter of future scien- 
tists, technicians and engineers — 
the free world's greatest need. 
Proof: our second largest sale in 
proportion to population is in uni- 
versity towns. And they mostly 
stay with science fiction: our larg- 
est sale in proportion to popula- 
tion is in towns where scientific 
installations are the principal in- 
dustry. There may be some whose 
interest wasn't first aroused by 



science fiction, but our surveys 
have not found them. 

Entertainment, remember, based 
on research and extrapolation — 
plus something that is true of sci- 
ence fiction and no other litera- 
ture: crag-leaping. 

Extrapolation climbs as far as it 
can, clear to the furthest limits. 
But those limits inevitably become 
limiting. When that happens, a 
leap is needed off the top of the 
old crag to the base of a new one. 
Not hanging on with one hand 
while reaching with the other. A 
fast, nervy jump, with the crag- 
hangers laughing — until the safe 
landing. 

There are many examples, but 
I am fond of one: gravity ham- 
pered Wells, so he abolished it. 
Verne jeered; he'd used scientifi- 
cally sound cannon propulsion. 
Verne's idea never was used, never 
will be. An anti-gravity research 
program sees success in 40 years. 
A conservative estimate — it prob- 
ably will be much before that. 

Crag-leaping is creative science, 
creative science fiction both. With 
only research and extrapolation, 
we'd still be living in caves, using 
flint arrows — each the ultimate. 

Come about or not, that isn't 
the point. Most experiments don't 
— till one does. Even then, it is 
the leap that counts. That's the 
real contribution of basic science 
and science fiction.

THE BIG TIME 

By FRITZ LEIBER 

Concluding a 2-part serial 

Safe outside the cosmos, the Place gave refuge 
to Soldiers after their raids on history . . . but 
now mutiny had turned it into a bomb in a bag! 



SYNOPSIS 



LET me bring you up to 
date fast. My name is 
Greta Forzane and I'm a 
combination party girl and psy- 



chiatric aide, working in a midget 
universe about a half a block 
across and outside the universe you 
do your living in. My job is to

entertain Soldiers who've been 
driven half nuts in the Change 
War, which is a war of two mys- 
terious time-traveling powers called 
the Spiders (our side) and the 
Snakes (the enemy). Our Soldiers 
fight by going back to change the 
past, or ahead to change the future, 
in ways to help the Spiders beat 
the Snakes. 



History's already been changed 
a lot from what you know it: the 
Nazis win World War Two and 
rule an empire stretching from Si- 
beria to Kansas, the American 
Civil War never occurred, and the 
Roman Empire got licked just as 
it was getting started two thousand 
years ago. 

I used to live in Chicago, as hu- 



THE BIG TIME 



99 



man as you, or more so, but when 
I died I got Resurrected, as we call 
it, and recruited onto the Big Time 
by the Spiders. My co-workers are 
Sid Lessingham, a bully-boy from 
Shakespeare's England; Beau Las- 
siter, a Mississippi gambler from 
the Greater South; Doc Pyeshkov, 
a drunken medico from a Russia 
that didn't have any Revolution 
and got conquered by the Nazis; 
Maud Davies, a starship girl born 
on Ganymede some centuries in 
the future; and Lily Foster, an 
English girl who lost her big love, 
a poet named Bruce Marchant, in 
World War One and then took to 
drink and whoopee. All dead and 
Resurrected, of course. 

The midget universe we Enter- 
tainers work in is fixed up like a 
nightclub and we just call it the 
Place. Two little instruments that 
look like portable radios — the 
Major and Minor Maintainers — 
keep it going and in contact with 
ordinary space-time. 

I'D been working in the Place on 
the Big Time about a year or 
so when three Soldiers turned up 
uniformed as Black Hussars and 
fresh from an operation in old St. 
Petersburg. I knew one of them 
real well and was even sweet on 
him: Erich von Hohenwald, a com- 
mandant from the victorious Nazi 
empire. The other two were new 
to me: a Roman legate named 
Mark and a young English lieu- 



tenant from World War One who 
turned out to be Lily's old heart- 
throb Bruce Marchant 

This Bruce was in a tearing rage, 
believe it or not, because he'd been 
accidentally issued two left-hand 
gloves with his uniform, and he 
started a big gripe and got in a 
fight with Erich, but Lily found 
him a right-hand glove and he sim- 
mered down and began to enjoy 
the party. 

But just then the Major Main- 
tainer blinked an SOS and we had 
to pick up three more Spiders: a 
fighting girl named Kaby from old 
Crete; a Lunan octopoid from way 
back called Ilhilihis — which I 
shorten to Illy because he's an old 
pal; and Sevensee, a Venusian 
satyr from way in the future. They 
had a fancy big casket with them 
and had been through a peck of 
troubles. 

Sid tried to get the party going 
again by animating a couple of 
Ghostgirls, which are phantom 
women who ordinarily don't oc- 
cupy much space and we keep 
them around in case we get crowds. 
These two Ghostgirls were an Aus- 
trian countess and a Greek cutie 
named Phryne. 

But Kaby spilled the news that 
the fancy chest had inside it a tac- 
tical atomic bomb, which we were 
supposed to plant in Egypt back in 
Roman times, so the Romans 
would win a battle from the Par- 
thians and not be lost to history. 



100 




 



This bomb business started a 
minor panic in the Place. Bruce 
jumped on top of the bar and did 
a good British job of calming us 
down, but then he went on to give 
us a long spiel about what miser- 
able lives we led as Soldiers and 
Entertainers, and how the Change 
War was destroying the whole uni- 
verse, and how we didn't know 
who the real Spiders were who 
were our bosses any more than we 
had any idea of the identity of the 
real Snakes. 

First thing we knew then, Bruce 
was asking us to start a mutiny 
against the High Command and 
drag into it all the other Soldiers 
and Entertainers we could, Spiders 
and Snakes alike. My Nazi boy 
friend Erich got shouting angry 
and stood up on the bomb chest 
and tried to quash the mutiny, but 
it came to a showdown. Beau, Doc, 
the satyr and Lily declared for 
Bruce and mutiny, while Mark, 
Kaby, Maud and Illy sided with 
Erich. 

Bruce had just got around to 
putting the question to me, which 
embarrassed me no end. Sid, boss 
of the Place and my special friend, 
hadn't declared himself either. I 
knew I was going to have to take 
sides, though I didn't want to, when 
I happened to look around and 
saw that the two Ghostgirls had 
disappeared— and the Major Main- 
tainer with them — the thing that 
kept the Place in existence! 



CHAPTER 9 

"We examined the moss between 
the bricks, and found it undis- 
turbed." 

"You looked among D 's 

papers, of course, and into the 
books of the library?" 

"Certainly; we opened every 
package and parcel; we not only 
opened every book, but we turned 
over every leaf in each volume . . ." 

-Poe 
A LOCKED ROOM 

^HREE hours later, Sid and 
■*■ I plumped down on the 
couch nearest the kitchen, though 
too tired to want to eat for a while 
yet. A tighter search than I could 
ever have cooked up had shown 
that the Maintainer was not in the 
Place. 

Of course it had to be in the 
Place, as we kept telling each 
other for the first two hours. It 
had to be, if circumstances and the 
theories we lived by in the Change 
World meant anything. A Main- 
tainer is what maintains a Place. 
The Minor Maintainer takes care 
of oxygen, temperature, humidity, 
gravity, and other little life-cycle 
and matter-cycle things generally, 
but it's the Major Maintainer that 
keeps the walls from buckling and 
the ceiling from falling in. It is 
little, but oh my, it does so much. 

It doesn't work by wires or radio 
or anything complicated like that. 



THE BIG TIME 



101 



It just hooks into local space- 
time. 

I have been* told that its in- 
side working part is made up. of 
vastly tough, vastly hard giant 
molecules, each one of which is 
practically a vest-pocket cosmos 
in itself. Outside, it looks like a 
portable radio with a few more 
dials and some telltales and 
switches and plug-ins for earphones 
and a lot of other sensory thing- 
umajigs. 

But the Maintainer was gone 
and the Void hadn't closed in, yet. 
By this time, I was so fagged, I 
didn't care much whether it did 
or not. 

One thing for sure, the Main- 
tainer had been switched to Intro- 
vert before it was spirited away 
or else its disappearance automati- 
cally produced Introversion, take 
your choice, because we sure were 
Introverted — real nasty martinet- 
schoolmaster grip of reality on my 
thoughts that I knew, without try- 
ing, liquor wouldn't soften, not a 
breath of Change Wind, alsolute- 
ly stifling, and the gray of the Void 
seeming so much inside my head 
that I think I got a glimmering 
of what the science boys mean 
when they explain to me that the 
Place is a kind of interweaving of 
the material and the mental — a 
Giant Monad, one of them called 
it. 

Anyway, I said to myself, 
"Greta, if this is Introversion, I 



want no part of it. It is not nice 
to be cut adrift from the cosmos 
and know it. A lifeboat in the 
middle of the Pacific and a starship 
between galaxies are not in it for 
loneliness." 

ASKED myself why the Spi- 
-"■ ders had ever equipped Main- 
tamers with Introversion switches 
anyway, when we couldn't drill 
with them and weren't supposed to 
use them except in an emergency 
so tight that it was either Intro- 
vert or surrender to the Snakes, 
and for the first time the obvious 
explanation came to me: 

Introversion must be the same 
as scuttling, its main purpose to 
withhold secrets and materiel from 
the enemy. It put a place into a 
situation from which even the 
Spider high command couldn't 
rescue it, and there was nothing 
left but to sink down, down (out? 
up?), down into the Void. 

If that was the case, our chances 
of getting back were about those 
of my being a kid again playing in 
the Dunes on the Small Time. 

I edged a little closer to Sid 
and sort of squunched under his 
shoulder and rubbed my cheek 
against the smudged, gold-worked 
gray velvet. He looked down and 
I said, "A long way to Lynn Regis, 
eh, Siddy?" 

"Sweetling, thou spokest a 
mouthful," he said. He knows very 
well what he is doing when he 



102 



GALAXY SCIENCE. FICTION 



mixes his language that way, the 
wicked old darling. 

"Siddy," I said, "why this gold- 
work? IrM be a lot smoother with- 
out it." 

"Marry, men must prick them- 
selves out and, 'faith I know not, 
but it helps if there's metal in it." 

"And girls get scratched." I took 
a little sniff. "But don't put this 
doublet through the cleaner yet. 
Until we get out of the woods, I 
want as much you around as 
possible." 

"Marry, and why should I?" he 
asked blankly, and I think he 
wasn't fooling me. The last thing 
time travelers find out is how they 
do or don't smell. Then his face 
clouded and he looked as though 
he wanted to squunch under my 
shoulder. "But 'faith, sweetling, 
your forest has a few more trees 
than Sherwood." 

"Thou saidst it," I agreed, and 
wondered about the look. He 
oughtn't to be interested in my 
girlishness now. I knew I was a 
mess, but he had stuck pretty close 
to me during the hunt and you 
never can tell. Then I remembered 
that he was the other one who 
hadn't declared himself when 
Bruce was putting it to us, and it 
probably troubled his male vanity. 
Not me, though — I was still grate- 
ful to the Maintainer for getting 
me out of that spot, whatever other 
it had got us all into. It seemed 
ages ago. 



WE'D all jumped to the con- 
clusion that the two Ghost- 
girls had run away with the Main- 
tainer, I don't know where or why, 
but it looked so much that way. 
Maud had started yiping about 
how she'd never trusted Ghosts 
and always known that some day 
they'd start doing things on their 
own, and Kaby had got it firmly 
fixed in her head, right between the 
horns, that Phryne, being a Greek, 
was the ringleader and was going 
to wreak havoc on us all. 

But when we were checking 
Stores the first time, I had noticed 
that the Ghostgirl envelopes looked 
flat. Ectoplasm doesn't take up 
much space when it's folded, but I 
had opened one anyway, then an- 
other, and then called for help. 

Every last envelope was empty. 
We had lost over a thousand Ghost- 
girls, Sid's whole stock. 

Well, at least it proved what 
none of us had ever seen or heard 
of being demonstrated: that there 
is a spooky link — a sort of Change 
Wind contact — between a Ghost 
and its lifeline; and when that 
umbilicus, I've heard it called, is 
cut, the part away from the life- 
line dies. 

Interesting, but what had both- 
ered me was whether we Demons 
were going to evaporate too, be- 
cause we are as much Doublegan- 
gers as the Ghosts and our apron 
strings had been cut just as sure- 
ly. We're more solid, of course, but 



THE BIG TIME 



103 



that would only mean we'd take a 
little longer. Very logical. 

I remember I had looked up at 
Lili and Maud — us girls had been 
checking the envelopes; it's one of 
the proprieties we frequently main- 
tain and anyway, if men check 
them, they're apt to trot out that 
old wheeze about "instant women" 
which I'm sick to death of hear- 
ing, thank you. 

Anyway, I had looked up and 
said, "It's been nice knowing you," 
and Lili had said, "Twenty-three, 
skiddoo," and Maud had said, 
"Here goes nothing," and we had 
shook hands all around. 

We figured that Phryne and the 
Countess had faded at the same 
time as the other Ghostgirls, but 
an idea had been nibbling at me 
and I said, "Siddy, do you sup- 
pose it's just barely possible that, 
while we were all looking at Bruce, 
those two Ghostgirls would have 
been able to work the Maintainer 
and get a Door and lam out of 
here with the thing?" 

"Thou speakst my thoughts, 
sweetling. All weighs against it: 
Imprimis, 'tis well known that 
Ghosts cannot lay plots or act on 
them. Secundo, the time forbade 
getting a Door. Tercio— and here's 
the real meat of it — the Place 
folds without the Maintainer. 
Quadro, 'twere folly to depend on 
not one of — how many of us? ten, 
elf — not looking around in all the 
time it would have taken them—" 



"I looked around once, Siddy. 
They were drinking and they had 
got to the control divan under their 
own power. Now when was that? 
Oh, yes, when Bruce was talking 
about Zombies." 

"Yes, sweetling. And as I was 
about to cap my argument with 
quinquo when you 'gan prattle, I 
could have sworn none could touch 
the Maintainer, much less work it 
and purloin it, without my certain 
knowledge. Yet . . ." 

"Eftsoons yet," I seconded him. 

COMEBODY must have got a 
^ door and walked out with the 
thing. It certainly wasn't in the 
Place. The hunt had been a lulu. 
Something the size of a portable 
typewriter is not easy to hide and 
we had been inside everything 
from Beau's piano to the renewer 
link of the Refresher. 

We had even fluoroscoped 
everybody, though it had made 
Illy writhe like a box of worms, as 
he'd warned us; he said it tickled 
terribly and I insisted on smooth- 
ing his fur for five minutes after- 
ward, although he was a little 
standoffish toward me. 

Some areas, like the bar, kitchen 
and Stores, took a long while, but 
we were thorough. Kaby helped 
Doc check Surgery: since she last 
made the Place, she has been sta- 
tioned in a Field Hospital (it turns 
out the Spiders actually are mount- 
ing operations from them) and 



104 




 



learned a few nice new wrinkles. 

However, Doc put in some 
honest work on his own, though, 
of course, every check was ob- 
served by at least three people, not 
including Bruce or Lili. When the 
Maintainer vanished, Doc had 
pulled out of his glassy-eyed drunk 
in a way that would have sur- 
prised me if I hadn't seen it hap- 
pen to him before, but when we 
finished Surgery and got on to the 
Art Gallery, he had started to put- 
ter and I noticed him hold out 
his coat and duck his head and 
whip out a flask and take a swig 
and by now he was well on his 
way toward another peak. 

The Art Gallery had taken time 
too, because there's such a jumble 
of strange stuff, and it broke my 
heart but Kaby took her ax and 
split a beautiful blue woodcarving 
of a Venusian medusa because, al- 
though there wasn't a mark in the 
paw-polished surface, she claimed 
it was just big enough. Doc cried 
a little and we left him fitting the 
pieces together and mooning over 
the other stuff. 

After we'd finished everything 
else, Mark had insisted on tackling 
the floor. Beau and Sid both tried 
to explain to him how this is a one- 
sided Place, that there is nothing, 
but nothing, under the floor; it 
just gets a lot harder than the 
diamonds crusting it as soon as 
you get a quarter inch down — 
that being the solid equivalent of 



the Void. But Mark was knuckle- 
headed (like all Romans, Sid as- 
sured me on the q. t.) and broke 
four diamond-plus drills before he 
was satisfied. 

Except for some trick hiding 
places, that left the Void, and 
things don't vanish if you throw 
them at the Void — they half 
melt and freeze forever unless you 
can fish them out. Back of the Re- 
fresher, at about eye-level, are 
three Venusian coconuts that a 
Hittite strongman threw there dur- 
ing a major brawl. I try not to look 
at them because they are so much 
like witch heads they give me the 
woolies. The parts of the Place 
right up against the Void have 
strange spatial properties which 
one of the gadgets in Surgery 
makes use of in a way that gives 
me the worse woolies, but that's 
beside the point. 

INURING the hunt, Kaby and 
*J Erich had used their Callers 
as direction finders to point out the 
Maintainer, just as they're used in 
the cosmos to locate the Door — 
and sometimes in the Big Places, 
people tell me. But the Callers 
only went wild — like a compass 
needle whirling around without 
stopping — and nobody knew what 
that meant. 

The trick hiding places were the 
Minor Maintainer, a cute idea, but 
it is no bigger than the Major and 
has its own mysterious insides and

had obviously kept on doing its 
own work, so that was out for 
several reasons, and the bomb 
chest, though it seemed impossible 
for anyone to have opened it, 
granting they knew the secret of 
its lock, even before Erich jumped 
on it and put it in the limelight 
double. But when you've ruled out 
everything else, the word impos- 
sible changes meaning. 

Since time travel is our business, 
a person might think of all sorts 
of tricks for sending the Main- 
tainer into the past or future, per- 
manently or temporarily. But the 
Place is strictly on the Big Time 
and everybody that should know 
tells me that time traveling 
through the Big Time is out. If s 
this way: the Big Time is a train, 
and the Little Time is the country- 
side and we're on the train, unless 
we go out a Door, and as Gertie 
Stein might put it, you can't time 
travel through the time you time 
travel in when you time travel. 

I'd also played around with the 
idea of some fantastically obvious 
hiding place, maybe something that 
several people could pass back and 
forth between them, which would 
mean a conspiracy, and, of course, 
if you assume a big enough con- 
spiracy, you can explain anything, 
including the cosmos itself. Still, 
I'd got a sort of shell-game idea 
about the Soldiers' three big black 
shakos and I hadn't been satis- 
fied until I'd got the three to- 



gether and looked in them all at 
the same time. 

"Wake up, Greta, and take 
something. I can't stand here for- 
ever." Maud had brought us a 
tray of hearty snacks from then 
and yon, and I must say they were 
tempting; she whips up a mean 
hors d'oeuvre. 

I looked them over and said, 
"Siddy, I want a hot dog." 

"And I want a venison pasty! 
Out upon you, you finical jill, you 
o'erscrupulous jade, you whimsic 
and tyrannous poppet!" 

I grabbed a handful and snug- 
gled back against him. 

"Go on, call me some more, Sid- 
dy," I told him. "Real juicy ones."

MOTIVES AND 
OPPORTUNITIES 

MY big bad waif from King's 
Lynn had set the tray on 
his knees and started to wolf the 
food down. The others were finish- 
ing up. Erich, Mark and Kaby 
were having a quietly furious ar- 



106 




 



gument I couldn't overhear at the 
end of the bar nearest the bronze 
chest, and Illy was draped over 
the piano like a real octopus, lis- 
tening in. 

Beau and Sevensee were pacing 
up and down near the control di- 
van and throwing each other a 
word now and then. Beyond them, 
Bruce and Lili were sitting on the 
opposite couch from us, talking 
earnestly about something. Maud 
had sat down at the other end of 
the bar and was knitting — it's one 
of the habits like chess and quiet 
drinking, or learning to talk by 
squeak box, that we pick up to 
pass the time in the Place in the 
long stretches between parties. Doc 
was fiddling around the Gallery, 
picking things up and setting them 
down, still managing to stay on his 
feet at any rate. 

|" ILI and Bruce stood up, still 
-■^ gabbing intensely at each other, 
and Illy began to pick out with 
one tentacle a little tune in the 
high keys that didn't sound like 
anything on God's earth. "Where 
do they get all the energy?" I 
wondered. 

As soon as I asked myself that, 
I knew the answer and I began to 
feel the same way myself. It wasn't 
energy; it was nerves, pure and 
simple. 

Change is like a drug, I realized 
—you get used to the facts never 
staying the same, and one picture 



of the past and future dissolving 
into another maybe not very differ- 
ent but still different, and your 
mind being constantly goosed by 
strange moods and notions, like 
nightclub lights of shifting color 
with weird shadows between shin- 
ing right on your brain. 

The endless swaying and jog- 
ging is restful, like riding on a 
train. 

You soon get to like the move- 
ment and to need it without know- 
ing, and when it suddenly stops 
and you're just you and the facts 
you think from and feel from are 
exactly the same when you go 
back to them — boy, that's rough, 
as I found out now. 

The instant we got Introverted, 
everything that ordinarily leaks 
into the Place, wake or sleep, had 
stopped coming, and we were 
nothing but ourselves and what we 
meant to each other and what we 
could make of that, an awfully 
lonely, scratchy situation. 

I decided I felt like I'd been 
dropped into a swimming pool full 
of cement and held under until it 
hardened. 

I could understand the others 
bouncing around a bit. It was a 
wonder they didn't hit the Void. 
Maud seemed to be standing it the 
best; maybe she'd got a little prep- 
aration from the long watches 
between stars; and then she is 
older than all of us, even Sid, 
though with a small "o" in "older." 



THE BIG TIME 



107 



r I^HE restless work of the search 
-■■ for the Maintainer had masked 
the feeling, but now it was begin- 
ning to come full force. Before the 
search, Bruce's speech and Erich's 
interruptions had done a passable 
masking job too. I tried to remem- 
ber when I'd first got the feeling 
and decided it was after Erich 
had jumped on the bomb, about 
the time he mentioned poetry. 
Though I couldn't be sure. Maybe 
the Maintainer had been Intro- 
verted even earlier, when I'd 
turned to look at the Ghostgirls. 
I wouldn't have known. Nuts! 

Believe me, I could feel that 
hardened cement on every inch 
of me. I remembered Bruce's 
beautiful picture of a universe 
without Big Change and decided 
it was about the worst idea going. 
I went on eating, though I wasn't 
so sure now it was a good idea to 
keep myself strong. 

"Does the Maintainer have an 
Introversion telltale? Siddy!" 

" 'Sdeath, chit, and you love me, 
speak lower. Of a sudden, I feel 
not well, as if I'd drunk a butt of 
Rhenish and slept inside it. Mar- 
ry yes, blue. In short flashes, saith 
the manual. Why ask'st thou?" 

"No reason. God, Siddy, what 
I'd give for a breath of Change 
Wind." 

"Thou can'st say that eftsoons," 
he groaned. I must have looked 
pretty miserable myself, for he 
put his arm around my shoulders 



and whispered gruffly, "Comfort 
thyself, sweetling, that while we 
suffer thus sorely, we yet cannot 
die the Change Death." 

"What's that?" I asked him. 

I didn't want to bounce around 
like the others. I had a suspicion 
I'd carry it too far. So, to keep 
myself from going batty, I started 
to rework the business of who had 
done what to the Maintainer. 

During the hunt, there had been 
some pretty wild suggestions 
tossed around as to its disappear- 
ance or at least its Introversion: a 
feat of Snake science amounting 
to sorcery; the Spider high com- 
mand bunkering the Places from 
above, perhaps in reaction to the 
loss of the Express Room, in such 
a hurry that they hadn't even time 
to transmit warnings; the hand of 
the Late Cosmicians, those mys- 
terious hypothetical beings who are 
supposed to have successfully re- 
sisted the extension of the Change 
War into the future much beyond 
Sevensee's epoch — unless the Late 
Cosmicians are the ones fighting 
the Change War. 

One thing these suggestions had 
steered very clear of was naming 
any one of us as a suspect, whether 
acting as Snake spy, Spider polit- 
ical police, agent of — who knows, 
after Bruce? — a secret Change 
World Committee of Public Safe- 
ty or Spider revolutionary under- 
ground, or strictly on our own. 
Just as no one had piped a word, 



108 




 



since the Maintainer had been 
palmed, about the split between 
Erich's and Bruce's factions. 

Good group thinking probably, 
to sink differences in the emer- 
gency, but that didn't apply to 
what I did with my own thoughts. 

\V/HO wanted to escape so bad 
™ they'd Introvert the Place, 
cutting off all possible contact and 
communication either way with 
the cosmos and running the very 
big risk of not getting back to the 
cosmos at all? 

Leaving out what had happened 
since Bruce had arrived and stirred 
things up, Doc seemed to me to 
have the strongest motive. He knew 
that Sid couldn't keep covering up 
for him forever and that Spider 
punishments for derelictions of 
duty are not just the clink of a 
firing squad, as Erich had reminded 
us. But Doc had been flat on the 
floor in front of the bar from the 
time Bruce had jumped on top 
of it, though I certainly hadn't had 
my eye on him every second. 

Beau? Beau had said he was 
bored with the Place at a time 
when what he said counted, so 
he'd hardly lock himself in it may- 
be, forever, not to mention locking 
Bruce in with himself and the babe 
he had a yen for. 

Sid loves reality, Changing or 
not, and every least thing in it, 
people especially, more than any 
man or woman I've ever known — 



he's like a big-eyed baby who 
wants to grab every object and 
put it in his mouth — and it was 
hard to imagine him ever cutting 
himself off from the cosmos. 

Maud, Kaby, Mark and the 
two ETs? None of them had any 
motive I knew of, though Seven- 
see's being from the very far fu- 
ture did tie in with that idea about 
the Late Cosmicians, and there 
did seem to be something develop- 
ing between the Cretan and the 
Roman that could make them want 
to be Introverted together. 

"Stick to the facts, Greta," I re- 
minded myself with a private 
groan. 

That left Erich, Bruce, Lili and 
myself. 

Erich, I thought — now we're 
getting somewhere. The little com- 
mandant has the nervous system 
of a coyote and the courage of a 
crazy tomcat, and if he thought 
it would help him settle his battle 
with Bruce better to be locked in 
with him, he'd do it in a second. 

But even before Erich had 
danced on the bomb, he'd been 
heckling Bruce from the crowd. 
Still, there would have been time 
between heckles for him to step 
quietly back from us, Introvert the 
Maintainer and . . . well, that was 
nine-tenths of the problem. 

If I was the guilty party, I was 
nuts and that was the best ex- 
planation of all. Gr-r-r! 

Bruce's motives seemed so ob- 



THE BIG TIME 



109 



vious, especially the mortal (or 
was it immortal? ) danger he'd put 
himself in by inciting mutiny, that 
it seemed a shame he'd been in 
full view on the bar so long. Sure- 
ly, if the Maintainer had been In- 
troverted before he jumped on the 
bar, we'd all have noticed the 
flashing blue telltale. For that mat- 
ter, I'd have noticed it when I 
looked back at the Ghostgirls.— if 
it worked as Sid claimed, and he 
said he had never seen it in oper- 
ation, just read in the manual — 
oh, 'sdeath! 

13 UT Bruce didn't need oppor- 
*-* tunity, as I'm sure all the 
males in the Place would have told 
me right off, because he had Lili 
to pull the job for him and she 
had as much opportunity as any 
of the rest of us. Myself, I have 
large reservations to this woman- 
putty - in - the - hands - of - the - 
man-she-loves-madly theory, but I 
had to admit there was something 
to be said for it in this case, and 
it had seemed quite natural to me 
when the rest of us had decided, by 
unspoken agreement, that neither 
Lili's nor Bruce's checks counted 
when we were hunting for the 
Maintainer. 

That took care of all of us and 
left only the mysterious stranger, 
intruding somehow through a Door 
(how'd he get it without using our 
Maintainer? ) or from an unimagin- 
able hiding place or straight out 



of the Void itself. I know that last 
is impossible — nothing can step 
out of nothing — but if anything 
ever looked like it was specially 
built for something not at all nice 
to come looming out of, it's the 
Void — misty, foggily churning, 
slimy gray . . . 

"Wait a second," I told myself, 
"and hang onto this, Greta. It 
should have smacked you in the 
face at the start." 

Whatever came out of the Void, 
or, more to the point, whoever 
slipped back from our crowd to 
the Maintainer, Bruce would have 
seen them. He was looking at the 
Maintainer past our heads the 
whole time, and whatever hap- 
pened to it, he saw it. 

Erich wouldn't have, even after 
he was on the bomb, because he'd 
been stagewise enough to face 
Bruce most of the time to build 
up his role as tribune of the people. 

But Bruce would have — unless 
he got so caught up in what he 
was saying . . . 

No, kid, a Demon is always an 
actor, no matter how much he 
believes in what he's saying, and 
there never was an actor yet who 
wouldn't instantly notice a member 
of the audience starting to walk out 
on his big scene. 

So Bruce knew, which made him 
a better actor than I'd have been 
willing to grant, since it didn't look 
as if anyone else had thought of 
what had just occurred to me, 



110 




 



or they'd have gone over and put 
it to him. 

Not me, though — I don't work 
that way. Besides, I didn't feel up 
to it — Nervy Anna enfold me, I 
felt like pure hell. 

"Maybe," I told myself encour- 
agingly, "the Place is Hell," but 
added, "Be your age, Greta — be 
a real rootless, ruleless, ruthless 
twenty-nine."

THE WESTERN FRONT, 1917 

^T>LEASE don't, Lili." 

* "I shall, my love." 

"Sweetling, wake up! Hast the 
shakes?" 

I opened my eyes a little and 
lied to Siddy with a smile and 
locked my hands together tight 
and watched Bruce and Lili quar- 
rel nobly near the control divan 
and wished I had a great love to 



blur my misery and provide me 
with a passable substitute for 
Change Winds. 

Lili won the argument, judg- 
ing from the way she threw her 
head back and stepped away from 
Bruce's arms while giving him a 
proud, tender smile. He walked 
off a few steps; praise be, he didn't 
shrug his shoulders at us like an 
old husband, though his nerves 
were showing and he didn't seem 
to be standing Introversion well 
at all, as who of us were? 

Lili rested a hand on the head 
of the control divan and pressed 
her lips together and looked around 
at us, mostly with her eyes. She'd 
wound a gray silk bandeau around 
her bangs. Her short gray silk 
dress without a waistline made her 
look, not so much like a flapper, 
though she looked like that all 
right, as like a little girl, except 
the neckline was scooped low 
enough to show she wasn't. 

Her gaze hesitated and then 
stopped at me and I got a sunk 
feeling of what was coming, be- 
cause women are always picking 
on me for an audience. Besides, 
Sid and I were the centrist party 
of two in our fresh-out-of-the-shell 
Place politics. 

She took a deep breath and 
stuck out her chin and said in a 
voice that was even a little higher 
and Britisher than she usually 
uses, "We girls have often cried, 
'Shut the Door!' But now the Door 



THE BIG TIME 



111 



is jolly well shut for keeps!" 

I knew I'd guessed right and I 
felt crawly with embarrassment, 
because I know about this love 
business of thinking you're the 
other person and trying to live 
their life — and grab their glory, 
though you don't know that — and 
carry their message for them, and 
how it can foul things up. Still, 
I couldn't help admitting what she 
said wasn't too bad a start — un- 
pleasantly apt to be true, at any 
rate. 

"My fiance believes we may yet 
be able to open the Door. I do 
not. He thinks it is a bit premature 
to discuss the peculiar pickle in 
which we all find ourselves. I do 
not." 

There was a rasp of laughter 
from the bar. The militarists were 
reacting. Erich stepped out, look- 
ing very happy. "So now we have 
to listen to women making 
speeches," he called. "What is this 
Place, anyhow? Sidney Lessing- 
ham's Saturday Evening Sewing 
Circle?" 

"DEAU and Sevensee, who'd 
-■-* stopped their pacing halfway 
between the bar and the control 
divan, turned toward Erich, and 
Sevensee looked a little burlier, 
a little more like half a horse, than 
satyrs in mythology book illus- 
trations. He stamped — medium 
hard, I'd say — and said, "Ahh, 
go flya kite." I'd found out he'd 



learned English from a Demon 
who'd been a longshoreman with 
syndicalist - anarchist sympathies. 
Erich shut up for a moment and 
stood there grinning, his hands on 
his hips. 

Lili nodded to the satyr and 
cleared her throat, looking scared. 
But she didn't speak; I could see 
she was thinking and feeling some- 
thing, and her face got ugly and 
haggard, as if she were in a Change 
Wind that hadn't reached me yet, 
and her mouth went into a snarl 
to fight tears, but some spurted out, 
and when she did speak her voice 
was an octave lower and it wasn't 
just London talking but New York 
too. 

"I don't know how Resurrection 
felt to you people, because I'm new 
and I loathe asking questions, but 
to me it was pure torture and I 
wished only I'd had the courage to 
tell Suzaku, 'I wish to remain a 
Zombie, if you don't mind. I'd 
rather the nightmares.' But I ac- 
cepted Resurrection because I've 
been taught to be polite and be- 
cause there is the Demon in me I 
don't understand that always 
wishes to live, and I found that I 
still felt like a Zombie, although 
I could flit about, and that I still 
had the nightmares, except they'd 
grown a deal vivider. 

"I was a young girl again, seven- 
teen, and I suppose every woman 
wishes to be seventeen, but I wasn't 
seventeen inside my head — I was 



112 




 



a woman who had died of Bright's 
disease in New York in 1929 and 
also, because a Big Change blew 
my lifeline into a new drift, a wo- 
man who had died of the same 
disease in Nazi-occupied London 
in 1955, but rather more slowly 
because, as you can fancy, the 
liquor was in far shorter supply. I 
had to live with both those sets of 
memories and the Change World 
didn't blot them out any more than 
I'm told it does those of any 
Demon, and it didn't even push 
them into the background as I'd 
hoped it would. 

"When some Change Fellow 
would say to me, 'Hallo, beautiful, 
how about a smile?' or 'That's a 
posh frock, kiddo,' I'd be back at 
Bellevue looking down at my 
swollen figure and the light getting 
like spokes of ice, or in that dread- 
ful gin-steeped Stepney bedroom 
with Phyllis coughing herself to 
death beside me, or at best, for a 
moment, a little girl in Glamorgan 
looking at the- Roman road and 
wondering about the wonderful life 
that lay ahead." 

LOOKED at Erich, remem- 
■■- bering he had a long nasty 
future back in the cosmos himself, 
and at any rate he wasn't smiling, 
and I thought maybe he's getting 
a little humility, knowing some- 
one else has two of those futures, 
but I doubted it. 

"Because, you see," Lili kept 



forcing it out, "all my three lives 
I'd been a girl who fell in love 
with a great young poet she'd 
never met, the voice of the new 
youth and all youth, and she'd told 
her first big lie to get in the Red 
Cross and across to France to be 
nearer him, and it was all danger 
and dark magics and a knight in 
armor, and she pictured how she'd 
find him wounded but not serious- 
ly, with a little bandage around his 
head, and she'd light a fag for him 
and smile lightly, never letting him 
guess what she felt, but only be- 
ing her best self and watching to 
see if that made something happen 
to him . . . 

"And then the Boche machine 
guns cut him down at Passchen- 
daele and there couldn't ever have 
been bandages big enough and the 
girl stayed seventeen inside and 
messed about and tried to be 
wicked, though she wasn't very 
good at that, and to drink, and she 
had a bit more talent there, though 
drinking yourself to death is not 
nearly as easy as it sounds, even 
with a kidney weakness to help. 
But she turned the trick. 

"Then a cock crows. She wakes 
with a tearing start from the gray 
dreams of death that fill her life- 
line. It's cold daybreak. There's the 
smell of a French farm. She feels 
her ankles and they're not at all 
like huge rubber boots filled with 
water. They're not swollen the least 
bit. They're young legs. 



THE BIG TIME 



113 



"There's a little window ana the 
tops of a row of trees that may be 
poplars when there's more light, 
and what there is shows cots like 
her own and heads under blankets, 
and hanging uniforms make large 
shadows and a girl is snoring. 
There's a very distant rumble and 
it moves the window a bit. Then 
she remembers they're Red Cross 
girls many, many kilometers from 
Passchendaele and that Bruce 
Marchant is going to die at dawn 
today. 

"In a few more minutes, he's go- 
ing over the top where there's a 
crop-headed machine-gunner in 
field gray already looking down 



the sights and swinging the gun a 
bit. But she isn't going to die to- 
day. She's going to die in 1929 and 
1955. 

"And just as she's going mad, 
there's a creaking and out of the 
shadows tiptoes a Jap with a wo- 
man's hairdo and the whitest face 
and the blackest eyebrows. He's 
wearing a rose robe and a black 
sash which belts to his sides two 
samurai swords, but in his right 
hand he has a strange silver pistol. 
And he smiles at her as if they 
were brother and sister and lovers 
at the same time and he says, 
'Voulez-vous vivre, mademoiselle?' 
and she stares and he bobs his 




114 




 




THE BIG TIME 



115 



head and says, 'Missy wish live, 
yes, no?*" 

SID'S paw closed quietly around 
my shaking hands. It always 
gets me to hear about anyone's 
Resurrection, and although mine 
was crazier, it also had the Krauts 
in it. I hoped she wouldn't go 
through the rest of the formula and 
she didn't. 

"Five minutes later, he's gone 
down a stairs more like a ladder 
to wait below and she's dressing 
in a rush. Her clothes resist a 
little, as if they were lightly 
gummed to the hook and the 
stained wall, and she hates to 
touch them. It's getting lighter and 
her cot looks as if someone were 
still sleeping there, although it's 
empty, and she couldn't bring her- 
self to put her hand on the place 
if her new life depended on it. 

"She climbs down and her long 
skirt doesn't bother her because 
she knows how to swing it. Suzaku 
conducts her past a sentry who 
doesn't see them and a puffy-faced 
farmer in a smock coughing and 
spitting the night out of his throat. 
They cross the farmyard and it's 
filled with rose light and she sees 
the sun is up and she knows that 
Bruce Mar chant has just bled to 
death. 

"There's an empty open touring 
car chugging loudly, waiting for 
someone; it has huge muddy wheels 
with wooden spokes and a brass 



radiator that says 'Simplex.' But 
Suzaku leads her past it to a dung- 
hill and bows apologetically and 
she steps through a Door." 

I heard Erich say to the others 
at the bar, "How touching! Now 
shall I tell everyone about my 
operation?" But he didn't get much 
of a laugh. 

"That's how Lilian Foster came 
into the Change World with its 
steel-engraved nightmares and its 
deadly pace and deadlier lassi- 
tudes. I was more alive than I ever 
had been before, but it was the 
kind of life a corpse might get 
from unending electrical shocks 
and I couldn't summon any pur- 
pose or hope and Bruce Marchant 
seemed farther away than ever. 

"Then, not six hours ago, a Sol- 
dier in a black uniform came 
through the Door and I thought, 
'It can't be, but it does look like 
his photographs,' and then I 
thought I heard someone say the 
name Bruce, and then he shouted 
as if to all the world that he was 
Bruce Marchant, and I knew there 
was a Resurrection beyond Resur- 
rection, a true resurrection. Oh, 
Bruce-" 

She looked at him and he was 
crying and smiling and all the 
young beauty flooded back into 
her face, and I thought, "It has to 
be Change Winds, but it can't be. 
Face it without slobbering, Greta— 
there's something that works big- 
ger miracles than Change." 



116 




 



And she went on, "And then the 
Change Winds died when the 
Snakes vaporized the Maintainer 
or the Ghostgirls Introverted it 
and all three of them vanished so 
swiftly and silently that even Bruce 
didn't notice — those are the best 
explanations I can summon and I 
fancy one of them is true. At all 
events, the Change Winds died and 
my past and even my futures be- 
came something I could bear light- 
ly, because I have someone to bear 
them with me, and because at 
last I have a true future stretch- 
ing out ahead of me, an unknown 
future which I shall create by liv- 
ing. Oh, don't you see that all of us 
have it now, this big opportunity?" 

"Hussa for Sidney's suffragettes 
and the W.C.T.U.!" Erich cheered. 
"Beau, will you play us a medley 
of 'Hearts and Flowers' and 'On- 
ward, Christian Soldiers'? I'm 
deeply moved, Lili. Where do the 
rest of us queue up for the Great 
Love Affair of the Century?" 

CHAPTER 12 

Now is a bearable burden. What 
buckles the back is the added 
weight of the pasfs mistakes and 
the future's fears. 

I had to learn to close the front 
door to tomorrow and the back 
door to yesterday and settle down 
to here and now.

A BIG OPPORTUNITY 

TVTOBODY laughed at Erich's 
•L^ screwball sarcasms and still 
I thought, "Yes, perish his hys- 
terical little gray head, but he's 
half right — Lili's got the big thing 
now and she wants to serve it up 
to the rest of us on a platter, only 
love doesn't cook and cut that 
way." 

Those weren't bad ideas she had 
about the Maintainer, though, es- 
pecially the one about the Ghost- 
girls doing the Introverting — it 
would explain why there couldn't 
be Introversion drill, the manual 
stuff about blue flashes being win- 
dow-dressing, and something dis- 
appearing without movement or 
transition is the sort of thing that 
might not catch the attention — 
and I guess they gave the others 
something to think about too, for 
there wasn't any follow-up to 
Erich's frantic sniping. 

But I honestly didn't see where 
there was this big opportunity be- 
ing stuck away in a gray sack in 
the Void and I began to wonder 
and I got the strangest feeling and 
I said to myself, "Hang onto your 
hat, Greta. It's hope." 

"The dreadful thing about be- 
ing a Demon is that you have all 
time to range through," Lili was 
saying with a smile. "You can 
never shut the back door to yes- 
terday or the front door to tomor- 
row and simply live in the present. 



THE BIG TIME 



117 



out now unax s Deen clone ior usi 
the Door is shut, we need never 
again rehash the past or the future. 
The Spiders and Snakes can never 
find us, for who ever heard of a 
Place that was truly lost being 
rescued? And as those in the know 
have told me, Introversion is the 
end as far as those outside are 
concerned. So we're safe from the 
Spiders and Snakes, we need never 
be slaves or enemies again, and 
we have a Place in which to live 
our new lives, the Place prepared 
for us from the beginning." 

She paused. "Surely you under- 
stand what I mean? Sidney and 
Beauregard and Dr. Pyeshkov are 
the ones who explained it to me. 
The Place is a balanced aquarium, 
just like the cosmos. No one knows 
how many ages of Big Time it 
has been in use, without a bit of 
new material being brought in — 
only luxuries and people — and 
not a bit of waste cast off. No one 
knows how many more ages it may 
not sustain life. I never heard of 
Minor Maintainers wearing out. 
We have all the future, all the 
security, anyone can hope for. We 
have a Place to live together." 

V^OU know, she was dead right 
■*■ and I realized that all the time 
I'd had the conviction in the back 
of my mind that we were going to 
suffocate or something if we didn't 
get a Door open pretty quick. I 
should have known differently, if 



anybody should, because I'd once 
been in the Place without a Door 
for as long as a hundred sleeps 
during a foxhole stretch of the 
Change War and we'd had to start 
cycling our food and it had been 
okay. 

And then, because it is also 
the way my mind works, I started 
to picture in a flash the conse- 
quences of our living together all 
by ourselves like Lili said. 

I began to pair people off; I 
couldn't help it. Let's see, four 
women, six men, two ETs. 

"Greta," I said, "you're going to 
be Miss Polly Andry for sure. 
We'll have a daily newspaper and 
folk-dancing classes, we'll shut the 
bar except evenings, Bruce'll keep 
a rhymed history of the Place." 

I even thought, though I knew 
this part was strictly silly, about 
schools and children. I wondered 
what Siddy's would look like, or 
my little commandant's. "Don't go 
near the Void, dears." Of course 
that would be specially hard on 
the two ETs, but Sevensee at least 
wasn't so different and the genetics 
boys had made some wonderful 
advances and Maud ought to know 
about them and there were some 
amazing gadgets in Surgery when 
Doc sobered up. The patter of 
little hoofs . . . 

"My fiance spoke to you about 
carrying a peace message to the 
rest of the cosmos," Lili added, 
"and bringing an end to the Big 



118 




 



Change, and healing all the wounds 
that have been made in the Little 
Time." 

I looked at Bruce. His face was 
set and strained, as will happen to 
the best of them when a girl starts 
talking about her man's business, 
and I don't know why, but I said 
to myself, "She's crucifying him, 
she's nailing him to his purpose as 
a woman will, even when there's 
not much point to it, as now." 

And Lili went on, "It was a won- 
derful thought, but now we can- 
not carry or send any message and 
I believe it is too late in any event 
for a peace message to do any 
good. The cosmos is too raveled by 
change, too far gone. It will dis- 
solve, fade, 'leave not a rack be- 
hind.' We're the survivors. The 
torch of existence has been put in 
our hands. 

"We may already be all that's 
left in the cosmos, for have you 
thought that the Change Winds 
may have died at their source? We 
may never reach another cosmos, 
we may drift forever in the Void, 
but who of us has been Intro- 
verted before and who knows what 
we can or cannot do? We're a seed 
for a new future to grow from. 
Perhaps all doomed universes cast 
off seeds like this Place. It's a seed, 
it's an embryo, let it grow." 

She looked swiftly at Bruce and 
then at Sid and she quoted, 
"'Come, my friends, 'tis not too 
late to seek a newer world'." 



SQUEEZED Sid's hand and 
■*■ I started to say something to 
him, but he didn't know I was 
there; he was listening to Lili quote 
Tennyson with his eyes entranced 
and his mouth open, as if he were 
imagining new things to put into 
it - oh, Siddy! 

And then I saw the others were 
looking at her the same way. Ilhili- 
his was seeing finer feather forests 
than long-dead Luna's grow. The 
greenhouse child Maud ap-Ares 
Davies was stowing away on a 
starship bound for another galaxy, 
or thinking how different her life 
might have been, the children she 
might have had, if she'd stayed on 
the planets and out of the Change 
World. Even Erich looked as 
though he might be blitzing new 
universes, and Mark subduing 
them, for an eight-legged Fiihrer- 
imperator. Beau was throbbing up 
a wider Mississippi in a bigger- 
than-life sidewheeler. 

Even I — well, I wasn't dream- 
ing of a Greater Chicago. "Let's not 
go hog-wild on this sort of thing," 
I told myself, but I did look up 
at the Void and I got a shiver 
because I imagined it drawing 
away and the whole Place start- 
ing, to grow. 

"J truly meant what I said about 
a seed," Lili went on slowly. "I 
know, as you all do, that there are 
no children in the Change World, 
that there cannot be, that we all 
become instantly sterile, that what 



THE BIG TIME

they call a curse is lifted from us 
girls and we are no longer in bond- 
age to the moon." 

She was right, all right — if 
there's one thing that's been proved 
a million times in the Change 
World, it's that. 

"But we are no longer in the 
Change World," Lili said softly, 
"and its limitations should no 
longer apply to us, including that 
one. I feel deeply certain of it, 
but—" she looked around slowly— 
"we are four women here and I 
thought one of us might have a 
surer indication." 

My eyes followed hers around 
like anybody's would. In fact, 
everybody was looking around ex- 
cept Maud, and she had the sil- 
liest look of surprise on her face 
and it stayed there, and then, very 
carefully, she got down from the 
bar stool with her knitting. She 
looked at the half-finished pink bra 
with the long white needles stuck 
in it and her eyes bugged bigger 
yet, as if she were expecting it to 
turn into a baby sweater right then 
and there. Then she walked across 
the Place to Lili and stood beside 
her. While she was walking, the 
look of surprise changed to a quiet 
smile. The only other thing she 
did was throw her shoulders back 
a little. 

I was jealous of her for a second, 
but it was a double miracle for 
her, considering her age, and I 
couldn't grudge her that. And to 



tell the truth, I was a little fright- 
ened, too. Even with Dave, I'd 
been bothered about this business 
of having babies. 

Y ET 1 stood U P with Siddy — 
-*- I couldn't stop myself and I 
guess he couldn't either — and 
hand in hand we walked to the 
control divan. Beau and Sevensee 
were there and Bruce, of course, 
and then, so help me, those Sol- 
diers to the death, Kaby and Mark, 
started over from the bar and I 
couldn't see anything in their eyes 
about the greater glory of Crete 
and Rome, but something, I think, 
about each other, and after a mo- 
ment Illy slowly detached him- 
self from the piano and followed, 
lightly trailing his tentacles on the 
floor. 

I couldn't exactly see him hop- 
ing for little lilies in this company, 
unless it was true what the jokes 
said about Lunans, but maybe he 
was being really disinterested and 
maybe he wasn't; maybe he was 
simply figuring that Illy ought to 
be on the side with the biggest bat- 
talions. 

I heard dragging footsteps be- 
hind us and here came Doc from 
the Gallery, carrying in his folded 
arms an abstract sculpture as big 
as a newborn baby. It was an ag- 
glomeration of perfect shiny gray 
spheres the size of golfballs, shap- 
ing up to something like a large 
brain, but with holes showing

through here and there. He held 
it out to us like an infant to be 
admired and worked his lips and 
tongue as if he were trying very 
hard to say something, though not 
a word came out that you could 
understand, and I thought, ''Maxey 
Aleksevich may be speechless 
drunk and have all sorts of holes 
in his head, but he's got the right 
instincts, bless his soulful little 
Russian heart."' 

We were all crowded around the 
control divan like a football team 
huddling. The Peace Packers, it 
came to me. Sevensee would be 
fullback or center and Illy left end 
— what a receiver! The right num- 
ber, too. Erich was alone at the 
bar, but now even he— "Oh, no, this 
can't be," I thought— even he came 
toward us. Then I saw that his face 
was working the worst ever. He 
stopped halfway and managed to 
force a smile, but it was the worst, 
too. "That's my little com- 
mandant," I thought, "no team 
spirit." 

"So now Lili and Bruce — yes, 
and Grossmutterchen Maud— have 
their little nest," he said, and he 
wouldn't have had to push his 
voice very hard to get a screech. 
"But what are the rest of us sup- 
posed to be — cowbirds?" 

XJTE crooked his neck and flapped 
•"••*■ his hands and croaked, "Cuc- 
koo! Cuc-koo!" And I said to my- 
self, "I often thought you were 



crazy, boy, but now I know." 

"Teufelsdreck! — yes, Devil's 
dirt! — but you all seem to be in- 
fected with this dream of chil- 
dren. Can't you see that the 
Change World is the natural and 
proper end of evolution?— a period 
of enjoyment and measuring, an 
ultimate working out of things, 
which women call destruction — 
'Help, I'm being raped!' 'Oh, what 
are they doing to my children?'— 
but which men know as fulfillment. 
"You're given good parts in 
Gotterdammerung and you go up 
to the author and tap him on the 
shoulder and say,. 'Excuse me, Hen- 
Wagner, but this Twilight of the 
Gods is just a bit morbid. Why 
don't you write an opera for me 
about the little ones, the dear 
little blue-eyed curly-tops? A plot? 
Oh, boy meets girl and they settle 
down to breed, something" like that.' 
"Devil's dirt doubled and 
damned! Have you thought what 
life will be like without a Door 
to go out of to find freedom and 
adventure, to measure your courage 
and keenness? Do you want to 
grow long gray beards hobbling 
around this asteroid turned inside 
out? Putter around indoors to the 
end of your days, mooning about 
little' baby cosmoses? — incidental- 
ly, with a live bomb for company. 
The cave, the womb, the little gray 
home in the nest — is that what 
you want? It'll grow? Oh, yes, like 
the city engulfing the wild wood, a

proliferation of Kinder, Kirche, 
Kiiche — I should live so long! 

"Women! — how I hate their 
bright eyes as they look at me 
from the fireside, bent-shouldered, 
rocking, deeply happy to be old, 
and say, 'He's getting weak, he's 
giving out, soon I'll have to put 
him to bed and do the simplest 
things for him.' Your filthy Triple 
Goddess, Kaby, the birther, bride, 
and burier of man! Woman, the 
enfeebler, the fetterer, the crippled 
Woman! — -and the curly-headed 
little cancers she wants!" 

He lurched toward us, pointing 
at Lili. "I never knew one who 
didn't want to cripple a man if 
you gave her the chance. Cripple 
him, swaddle him, clip his wings, 
grind him to sausage to mold an- 
other man, hers, a doll man. You 
hid the Maintainer, you little 
smother-hen, so you could have 
your nest and your Brucie!" 

He stopped, gasping, and I. ex- 
pected someone to bop him one on 
the schnozzle,. and I think he did, 
too. I turned to Bruce and he was 
looking, I don't know how, sor- 
ry, guilty, anxious, angry, shaken, 
inspired, all at once, and I wished 
people sometimes had simple sub- 
urban reactions like magazine 
stories. 

Then Erich made the mistake, 
if it was one, of turning toward 
Bruce and slowly staggering 
toward him, pawing the air with 
his hands as if he were going to 



collapse into his arms, and saying, 
"Don't let them get you, Bruce. 
Don't let. them tie you down. Don't 
let them clip you — your words 
or your deeds. You're a Soldier. 
Even when you talked about a 
peace message, you talked about 
doing some smashing of your own. 
No matter what you think and 
feel, Bruce, no matter how much 
lying you do and how much you 
hide, you're really not on their 
side." 

That did it. 

TT didn't come soon enough or, 
■■■ X think, in the right spirit to 
please me, but I will say it for 
Bruce that he didn't muck it up 
by tipping or softening his punch. 
He took one step forward and his 
shoulders spun and his fist con- 
nected sweet and clean. 

As he did it, he said only one 
word, "Loki!" and darn if that 
didn't switch me back to a camp- 
fire in the Indiana Dunes and my 
mother telling me out of the El- 
der Saga about the malicious, 
sneering, all-spoiling Norse god 
and how, when the other gods 
came to trap him in his hideaway 
by the river, he was on the point 
of finishing knotting a mysterious 
net big enough, I had imagined, 
to snare the whole universe, and 
that if they'd come a minute later, 
he would have. 

Erich was stretched on the floor, 
his head hitched up, rubbing his 



122 




 



jaw and glaring at Bruce. Mark, 
who was standing beside me, 
moved a little and I thought he 
was going to do something, may- 
be even clobber Bruce in the old 
spirit of you can't do that to my 
buddy, but he just shook his head 
and said, "Omnia vincit amor" I 
nudged him and said, "Meaning?" 
and he said, "Love licks every- 
thing." 

I'd never have expected it from 
a Roman, but he was half right at 
any rate. Lili had her victory: 
Bruce clearing the field for the 
marriage by laying out the woman- 
hating boy friend who would be 
trying to get him to go out nights. 
At that moment, I think Bruce 
wanted Lili and a life with her 
more than he wanted to reform the 
Change World. Sure, us women 
have our little victories — until 
the legions come or the Little Cor- 
poral draws up his artillery or the 
Panzers roar down the road. 

Erich scrambled to his feet and 
stood there in a half-slump, half- 
crouch, still rubbing his jaw and 
glaring at Bruce over his hand, but 
making no move to continue the 
fight, and I studied his face and 
said to myself, "If he can get a 
gun, he's going to shoot himself, I 
know." 

Bruce started to say sometning 
and hesitated, hke I would have 
in his shoes, and just then Doc 
got one of his unpredictable in- 
spirations and went weaving out 



toward Erich, holding out the sculp- 
ture and making deaf-and-dumb 
noises like he had to us. Erich 
looked at him as if he were going 
to kill him, and then grabbed the 
sculpture and swung it up over 
his head and smashed it down on 
the floor, and for a wonder, it 
didn't shatter. It just skidded along 
in one piece and stopped inches 
from my feet. 

That thing not breaking must 
have been the last straw for Erich. 
I swear I could see the red surge 
up through his eyes toward his 
brain. He swung around into the 
Stores sector and ran the few steps 
between him and the bronze bomb 
chest. 

Everything got very slow mo- 
tion for me, though I didn't do any 
moving. Almost every man started 
out after Erich. Bruce didn't, 
though, and Siddy turned back 
after the first surge forward, while 
Illy squunched down for a leap, 
and it was between Sevensee's 
hairy shanks and Beau's scissor- 
ing white pants that I saw that un- 
der-the-microscope circle of death's 
heads and watched Erich's finger 
go down on them in the order 
Kaby had given: one, three, five, 
six, two, four, seven. I was able to 
pray seven distinct times that he'd 
make a mistake. 

He straightened up. Illy landed 
by the box like a huge silver spider 
and his tentacles whipped futilely 
across its top. The others surged 



THE BIG TIME 



123 



to a frightened halt around them: 
Erich's chest was heaving, but 
his voice was cool and collected 
as he said, "Yqu mentioned some- 
thing about our having a future, 
Miss Foster Now you can make 
that more specific. Unless we get 
back to .the cosmos and dump this 
box, or find a Spider A-tech, or 
manage to call headquarters for 
guidance on disarming the bomb, 
we have a future exactly thirty 
minutes long."

GUESS when they really push 
-■■ tl\e button or throw the switch 
or spring the trap "or focus the 
beam or what have you, you don't 
faint or go crazy or anything else 
convenient. I didn't. Everything, 
everybody, every move that was 
made, every word that was spoken, 
was painfully real to me, like -a 
hand twisting and squeezing things 
deep inside me, and I saw every 
least detail spotlighted and mag- 
nified like I had the seven skulls. 
Erich was standing beyond the 



bomb chest; little smiles were 
ruffling his lips. I'd never seen him 
look so sharp. Illy was beside him, 
but not on his side, you under- 
stand. Mark, Sevensee and Beau 
were around the chest to the nearer 
side. Beau had dropped to a knee 
and was scanning the chest minute- 
ly, terror-under-control making him 
bend his head a little closer than 
he needed to for clear vision, but 
with his hands locked together be- 
hind his back, I guess to restrain 
the impulse to push any and every- 
thing that looked like a disarming 
button. 

Doc was sprawled face down on 
the nearest couch, out like a light, 
I suppose. 

Us four girls were still by the 
control divan. With Kaby, that 
surprised me, because she didn't 
look scared or frozen, but almost 
as intensely alive as Erich. 

Sid had turned back, as I'd said, 
and had one hand stretched out 
toward but not touching the "Minor 
Maintainer, and a look on his 
beardy face as if he were calling 
down death and destruction on 
every boozy fogue who had ever 
gone up from King's. Lynn to Cam- 
bridge and London, and I realized 
why: if he'd thought of the Minor 
Maintainer a second sooner, he 
could have pinned Erich down 
with heavy gravity before he could 
touch the buttons. 

Bruce was resting one hand on 
the head of the control divan and 



124 




 



was looking toward the group 
around the chest, toward Erich, I 
think, as if Erich had done some- 
thing rather wonderful for him, 
though I can't imagine myself be- 
ing tickled at being included in 
anybody's suicide surprise party. 
Bruce looked altogether too 
dreamy, Brahma blast him, for 
someone who must have the same 
steel-spiked thought in his head 
that I know darn well the rest of 
us had: that in twenty-nine min- 
utes or so, the Place would be a 
sun in a bag. 

"P 1 RICH was the first to get down 
■" to business, as I'd have laid 
any odds he would be. He had the 
jump on us and he wasn't going 
to lose it. 

"Well, when are you going to 
start getting Lili to tell us where 
she hid the Maintainer? It has to 
be her — she was too certain it 
was gone forever when she talked. 
And Bruce must have seen from 
the bar who took the Maintainer, 
and who would he cover up for 
but his girl?" 

There he was plagiarizing my 
ideas, but I guess I was willing to 
sign them over to him in full if he 
got us the right pail of water for 
that time-bomb. 

He glanced at his wrist. "Ac- 
cording to my Caller, you have 
twenty-nine and a half minutes, 
including the time it will take to 
get a Door or contact headquar- 



ters. When are you going to get 
busy on the girl?" 

Bruce laughed a little — depre- 
catingly, so help me — and started 
toward him. "Look here, old man," 
he said, "there's no need to trouble 
Lili, or to fuss with headquarters, 
even if you could. Really not at 
all. Not to mention that your sur- 
mises are quite unfounded, old 
chap, and I'm a bit surprised at 
your advancing them. But that's 
quite all right because, as it hap- 
pens, I'm an atomics technician 
and I even worked on that very 
bomb. To disarm it, you just have 
to fiddle a bit with some of the 
ankhs, those hoopy little crosses. 
Here, let me—" 

Allah il allah, but it must have 
struck everybody as it did me as 
being just too incredible an asser- 
tion, too bloody British a bare- 
faced bluff, for Erich didn't have to 
say a word; Mark and Sevensee 
grabbed Bruce by the arms, one 
on each side, as he stooped toward 
the bronze chest, and they weren't 
gentle about it. Then Erich spoke. 

"Oh, no, Bruce. Very sporting 
of you to try to cover Up for your 
girl friend, but we aren't going to 
let ourselves* be blown to stripped 
atoms twenty-eight minutes too 
soon while you monkey with the 
buttons, the very thing Benson- 
Carter warned against, and pray 
for a guesswork miracle. If s too

1917 and haven't been on the Big

Time for a hundred sleeps and 
were calling for an A-tech your- 
self a few hours ago. Much too 
thin. Bruce, something is going to 
happen that I'm afraid you won't 
like, but you're going to have to 
put up with it. That is, unless Miss 
Foster decides to be cooperative." 

"I say, you fellows, let me go," 
Bruce demanded, struggling experi- 
mentally. "I know it's a bit thick 
to swallow and I did give you the 
wrong impression calling for an 
A-tech, but I just wanted to cap- 
ture your attention then; I didn't 
want to have to work on the bomb. 
Really, Erich, would they have or- 
dered Benson-Carter to pick us up 
unless one of us were an A-tech? 
They'd be sure to include one in 
the bally operation." 

"When they're using patchwork 
tactics?" Erich grinningly quoted 
back at him. 

KABY spoke up beside me and 
said, "Benson-Carter was a 
magician of matter and he was go- 
ing on the operation disguised as 
an old woman. We have the cloak 
and hood with the other garments," 
and I wondered how this cold fish 
of a she-officer could be the same 
girl who was giving Mark slurpy 
looks not ten minutes ago. 

"Well?" Erich asked, glancing 
at his Caller and then swinging his 
eyes around at us as if there must 
be some of the old Wehrmacht 
iron somewhere. We all found our- 



selves looking at Lili and she was 
looking so sharp herself, so ready 
to jump and so at bay, that it was 
all / needed, at any rate, to make 
Erich's theory about the Main- 
tainer a rock-bottom certainty. 

Bruce must have realized the 
way our mind's were working, for 
he started to struggle in earnest 
and at the same time called, "For 
God's sake, don't do anything to 
Lili! Let me . loose, you idiots! 
Everything's true I told you — I 
can save you from that bomb. 
Sevensee, you took my side against 
the Spiders; you've nothing to 
lose. Sid, you're an Englishman. 
Beau, you're a gentleman and you 
love her, too — for God's sake, 
stop them!" 

Beau glanced up over his shoul- 
der at Bruce and the others surging 
around close to his ankles and he 
had on his poker face. Sid I could 
tell was once more going through 
the purgatory of decision. Beau 
reached his own decision first and 
I'll say it for him that he acted 
on it fast and intelligently. Right 
from his kneeling position and be- 
fore he'd even turned his head 
quite back, he jumped Erich. 

But other things in this cosmos 
besides Man can pick sides and 
act fast. Illy landed on Beau mid- 
way and whipped his tentacles 
around him tight .and they went 
wobbhng around like a drunken 
white-and-silyer barber pole. Beau 
got his hands each around a ten- 



126 




 



tacle, and at the same time his 
face began to get purple, and I 
winced at what they were both 
going through. 

Maybe Sevensee had a hoof in 
Sid's purgatory, because Bruce 
shook loose from the satyr and 
tried to knock out Mark, but the 
Roman twisted his arm and kept 
him from getting in a good punch. 

Erich didn't make a move to 
mix into either fight, which is my 
little commandant all over. Using 
his fists on anybody but me is 
beneath him. 

'T'HEN Sid made bis choice, but 
•** there was no way for me to tell 
what it was, for, as he reached for 
.the Minor Maintainer, Kaby con- 
temptuously snatched it away from 
his hands and gave him a knee in 
the belly that doubled me up in 
sympathy and sent him sprawling 
on his knees toward the fighters. 
On the return, Kaby gave Lili, 
who'd started to grab too, an effort-, 
less backhand smash that set her 
down on the divan. 

Erich's face lit up like an elec- 
tric sign and he kept his eyes fixed 
on Kaby. 

She crouched a little, carrying 
her weight on the balls of her feet 
and firmly cradling the Minor 
Maintainer in her left arm, like a 
basketball captain planning an of- 
fensive. *Th£n she waved her free 
hand decisively to the right. I didn't 
get it, but Erich did and Mark 



too, for Erich jumped for the Re- 
fresher sector and Mark let go of 
Bruce and followed him, ducking 
around Sevensee's arms, who was 
coming back into the fight on 
which side I don't know. Illy un- 
whipped from Beau and copied 
Erich and Mark with one 
big spring. 

Then Kaby twisted a dial as 
far as it would go and Bruce, Beau, 
Sevensee and poor Siddy were 
slammed down and pinned to the 
floor by about eight gravities. 

It should have been lighter near 
us — I hoped it was, but you 
couldn't tell from watching Siddy; 
he went flat on his face, spread- 
eagled, one hand stretched toward 
me so close, I could have touched 
it (but not let go!), and his mouth 
was open against the floor and he 
was gasping through a corner of 
it and I could see his spine trying 
to sink through his belly. Bruce 
just managed to get his head and 
one shoulder up a bit, and they 
all made me think of a Dore illus- 
tration of the Inferno where the 
cream of the damned are frozen up 
to their necks in ice in the inner- 
most circle of Hell. 

The gravity didn't catch me, al- 
though I could feel it in my left 
arm. I was mostly in the Refresher 
sector, but I dropped down flat too, 
partly out of a crazy compassion I 
have, but mostly because I didn't 
want to take a chance of having 
Kaby knock me down. 



THE BIG TIME 



127 



Erich, Mark and Illy had got 
clear and they headed toward us. 
Maud picked the moment to make 
her play; she hadn't much choice 
of times, if she wanted to make 
one. The Old Girl was looking it 
for once, but I guess the thought 
of her miracle must have survived 
alongside the fear of sacked sun 
and must have meant a lot to her, 
for she launched out fast, all set 
to straight-arm Kaby into the 
heavy gravity and grab the Minor 
Maintainer with the other hand. 

CHAPTER 14 

Like diamonds, we are cut with 
our own dust. — Webster 

"NOW WILL YOU TALK?" 

C CRETANS have eyes under 
J their back hair, or let's face it, 
Entertainers aren't Soldiers. Kaby 
weaved to one side and flicked a 
helpful hand and poor old Maud 
went where she'd been going to 
send Kaby. It sickened rne to see 
the gravity take hold and yank 
her down. 

I could have jumped up and 
made it four in a row for Kaby, 
but I'm not a bit brave when things 
like my life are at stake. 

Lili was starting to get up, act- 
ing a little dazed. Kaby gently 
pushed her down again and quietly 
said, "Where is it?" and then 
hauled off and slapped her across 



the face. What got me was the mat- 
ter-of-fact way Kaby did it. I can 
understand somebody getting mad 
and socking someone, or even de- 
liberately working up a rage so as 
to be able to do something nasty, 
but this cold-blooded way turns 
my stomach. 

Lili looked as if half her face 
were about to start bleeding, but 
she didn't look dazed any more 
and her jaw set. Kaby grabbed 
Lili's pearl necklace and twisted it 
around her neck and it broke and 
the pearls went bouncing around 
like ping-pong balls, so Kaby 
yanked down Lili's gray silk ban- 
deau until it was around the neck 
and tightened that. Lili started to 
choke through her tight-pressed 
lips. Erich, Mark and Illy had 
come up and crowded around, but 
they seemed to be content with the 
job Kaby was doing. 

"Listen, slut," she said, "we have 
no time. You have a healing room 
in this place. I can work the 
things." 

"Here it comes," I thought, wish- 
ing I could faint. On top of every- 
thing, on top of death even, they 
had to drag in the nightmare per- 
sonally stylized for me, the horror 
with my name on it. I wasn't going 
to be allowed to blow up peace- 
fully. They weren't satisfied with 
an A-bomb. They had to write my 
private hell into the script. 

"There is a thing called an In- 
vertor," Kaby said exactly as I'd 



128 




 



known she would, but as I didn't 
really hear it just then — a mental 
split I'll explain in a moment. "It 
opens you up so they can cure your 
insides without cutting your skin 
or making you bleed anywhere. It 
turns the big parts of you inside 
out, but not the blood tubes. All 
your skin — your eyes, ears, nose, 
toes, all of it — becoming the lining 
of a little hole that's half-filled with 
your hair. 

"Meantime, your insides are ex- 
posed for whatever the healer 
wants to do to them. You live for 
a while on the air inside the hole. 
First the healer gives you an air 
that makes you sleep, or you go 
mad in about fifty heartbeats. We'll 
see what ten heartbeats do to you 
without the sleepy air, Now will 
you talk?" 

HADN'T been listening to her, 
-■- though, riot the real me, or I'd 
have gone mad without getting the 
treatment. I once heard Doc say 
your liver is more mysterious and 
farther away from you than the 
stars, because although you live 
with your liver all your life, you 
never see it or learn to point to it 
instinctively, and the thought of 
someone messing around with that 
intimate yet unknown part of you 
is just too awful. 

I knew I had to do something 
quick. Hell, at the first hint of In- 
troversion, before Kaby had even 
named it, Illy had winced so that 



his tentacles were all drawn up like 
fat feather-sausages. Erich had 
looked at him questioningly, but 
that lousy Looney had un-endeared 
himself to me by squeaking, "Don't 
mind me, I'm just sensitive. Get on 
with the girl. Make her tell." 

Yes, I knew I had to do some- 
thing, and here on the floor that 
meant thinking hard and in high 
gear about something else. The 
screwball sculpture Erich had tried 
to smash was a foot from my nose 
and I saw a faint trail of white 
stuff where it had skidded. I 
reached out and touched the trail; 
it was finely gritty, like powdered 
glass. I tipped up the sculpture 
and the part on which it had 
skidded wasn't marred at all, not 
even dulled; the gray spheres were 
as glisteningly bright as ever. So I 
knew the trail was diamond dust 
rubbed off the diamonds in the 
floor by something even harder. 

That told me the sculpture was 
something special and maybe Doc 
had had a real idea in his pickled 
brain when he'd been pushing the 
thing at all of us and trying to tell 
us something. He hadn't managed 
to say anything then, but he had 
earlier when he'd been going to tell 
us what to do about the bomb, and 
maybe there was a connection. 

I twisted my memory hard and 
let it spring back and I got "In- 
versh . . . bosh . . ." Bosh, indeed! 
Bosh and inverse bosh to all booz- 
ers, Russki or otherwise. 



THE BIG TIME 



129 



So I quick tried the memory 
trick again and this time I got 
"glovsh" and then I grasped and 
almost sneezed on diamond dust 
as I watched the pieces fit them- 
selves together in my mind like a 
speeded-up movie reel. 

It all hung on that black right- 
hand hussar's glove Lili had pro- 
duced for Bruce. Only she couldn't 
have found it in Stores, because 
we'd searched every fractional 
pigeonhole later on and there 
hadn't been any gloves there, not 
even the left-hand mate there 
would have been. Also, Bruce had 
had two left-hand gloves to start 
with, and we had been through the 
whole Place with a fine-tooth 
comb, and there had been only the 
two black gloves on the floor where 
Bruce had kicked them off the 
bar— those two and those two only, 
the left-hand glove he'd brought 
from outside and the right-hand 
glove Lili had produced for him. 

SO a left-hand glove had disap- 
peared — the last I'd seen of it, 
Lili had been putting it on her tray 
—and a right-hand glove had ap- 
peared. Which could only add up 
to one thing: Lili had turned the 
left-hand glove into an identical 
right. She couldn't have done it by 
turning it inside out the ordinary 
way, because the lining was dif- 
ferent. 

But as I knew only too sicken- 
ingly well, there was an extraordi- 



nary way to turn things inside out, 
things like human beings. You 
merely had to put them on the In- 
vertor in Surgery and flick the 
switch for full Inversion. 

Or you could flick it for partial 
Inversion and turn something into 
a perfect three-dimensional mirror 
image of itself, just what a right- 
hand glove is of a left. Rotation 
through the fourth dimension, the 
science boys call it; I've heard of 
it being used in surgery on the 
highly asymmetric Martians, and 
even to give a socially impeccable 
right hand to a man who'd lost 
one, by turning an amputated right 
arm into an amputated left. 

Ordinarily, nothing but live 
things are ever Inverted in Sur- 
gery and you wouldn't think of do- 
ing it to an inanimate object, es- 
pecially in a Place where the Doc's 
a drunk and the Surgery hasn't 
been used for hundreds of sleeps. 

But when you've just fallen in 
love, you think of wonderful crazy 
things to do for people. Drunk with 
love, Lili had taken Bruce's extra 
left-hand glove into Surgery, par- 
tially Inverted it, and got a right- 
hand glove to give him. 

What Doc had been trying to 
say with his "Inversh . . . bosh . . ." 
was "Invert the box," meaning we 
should put the bronze chest 
through full Inversion to get at the 
bomb inside to disarm it. Doc too 
had got the idea from Lili's trick 
with the glove. What an inside- 



130 




 



out tactical atomic bomb would 
look like, I could not imagine and 
did not particularly care to see. 
I might have to, though, I realized. 
But the fast-motion film was still 
running in my head. Later on, 
Lili had decided like I had that 
her lover was going to lose out 
in his plea for mutiny unless she 
could give him a really captive 
audience— and maybe, even then, 
she had been figuring on creating 
the nest for Bruce's chicks and . . . 
all those other things we'd believed 
in for a while. So she'd taken the 
Major Maintainer and remem- 
bered the glove, and not many sec- 
onds later, she had set down on 
a shelf of the Art Gallery an ob- 
ject that no one would think of 
questioning— except someone who 
knew the Gallery by heart. 

I" LOOKED at the abstract sculp- 
■*■ ture a foot from my nose, at 
the clustered gray spheres the size 
of golfballs. I had known that the 
inside of the Maintainer was made 
up of vastly tough, vastly hard 
giant molecules, but I hadn't 
realized they were quite that big. 

I said to myself, "Greta, this is 
going to give you a major psy- 
chosis, but you're the one who has 
to do it, because no one is going 
to listen to your deductions when 
they're all practically living on 
negative time already." 

I got up as quietly as if I were 
getting out of a bed I shouldn't 



have been in — there are some 
things Entertainers are good at — 
and Kaby was just saying "you go 
mad in about fifty heartbeats." 
Everybody on their feet was look- 
ing at Lili. Sid seemed to have 
moved, but I had no time for him 
except to hope he hadn't done 
anything that might attract atten- 
tion to me. 

I stepped out of my shoes and 
walked rapidly to Surgery— there's 
one good thing about this hardest 
floor anywhere, it doesn't creak. 
I walked through the Surgery 
screen that is like a wall of opaque, 
odorless cigarette smoke and I 
concentrated on remembering my 
snafued nurse's training, and be- 
fore I had time to panic, I had the 
sculpture positioned on the gleam- 
ing table of the Invertor. 

I froze for a moment when I 
reached for the Inversion switch, 
thinking of the other time and 
trying to remember what it had 
been that bothered me so much 
about an inside-out brain being 
bigger and not having eyes, but 
then I either thumbed my nose at 
my nightmare or kissed my sanity 
good-by, I don't know which, and 
twisted the switch all the way over, 
and there was the Major Main- 
tainer winking blue about three 
times a second as nice as you 
could want it. 

It must have been working as 
sweet and steady as ever, all the 
time it was Inverted, except that, 



THE BIG TIME 



131 



being inside out, it had hocused 
the direction finders. 

CHAPTER 15 

black legged spiders 
with red hearts of hell 

—marquis 

LORD SPIDER 

*f TESU!" I turned and Sid's face 
tl was sticking through the 
screen like a tinted bas-relief hang- 
ing on a gray wall and I got the 
impression he had peered unex- 
pectedly through a slit in an arras 
into Queen Elizabeth's bedroom. 

He didn't have any time to lin- 
ger on the sensation, even if he'd 
wanted to, for an elbow with a 
copper band thrust through the 
screen and dug his ribs and Kaby 
marched Lili in by the neck. Erich, 
Mark and Illy were right behind. 
They caught the blue flashes and 
stopped dead, staring at the long- 
lost. Erich spared me one look 
which seemed to say, so you did 
it, not that it matters. Then he 
stepped forward and picked it up 
and held it solidly to his left sid0 
in the double right-angle made by 
fingers, forearm and chest, and 
reached for the Introversion switch 
with a look on his face as if he 
were opening a fifth of whisky. 

The blue light died and Change 
Winds hit me like a stiff drink 
that had been a long, long time in 



coming, like a hot trumpet note 
out of nowhere. 

I felt the changing pasts blow- 
ing through me, and the uncer- 
tainties whistling past, and ice-stiff 
reality softening with all its duties 
and necessities, and the little mem- 
ories shredding away and danc- 
ing off like autumn leaves, leav- 
ing maybe not even ghosts behind, 
and all the crazy moods like Mardi 
Gras dancers pouring down an 
evening street, and something in- 
side me had the nerve to say it 
didn't care whether Greta For- 
zane's death was riding in those 
Winds because they felt so good. 

I could tell it was hitting the 
others the same way. Even bat- 
tered, tight-lipped Lili seemed to 
be saying, you're making me drink 
the stuff and I hate you for it, 
but I do love it. I guess we'd all 
had the worry that even finding 
and Extroverting the Maintainer 
wouldn't put us back in touch with 
the cosmos and give us those 
Winds we hate and love. 

The thing that cut through to 
us as we stood there glowing was 
not the thought of the bomb, 
though that would have come in a 
few seconds more, but Sid's voice. 
He was still standing in the screen, 
except that now his face was out 
the other side and we could just 
see parts of his gray-doubleted 
back, but, of course, his "Jesu!" 
came through the screen as if it 
weren't there. 



132 




 



At first I couldn't figure but 
who he could be talking to, but 
I swear I never heard his voice 
so courtly obsequious before, so 
strong and yet so filled with awe 
and an under-note of, yes, sheer 
terror. 

"Lord, I am filled from top to 
toe with confusion that you should 
so honor my poor Place," he said. 
"Poor say I and mine, when I 
mean that I have ever busked it 
faithfully for you, not dreaming 
that you would ever condescend . . . 
yet knowing that your eye was 
certes ever upon me . . . though I 
am but as a poor pinch of dust 
adrift between the suns ... I 
abase myself. Prithee, how may I 
serve thee, sir? I know not e'en 
how most suitably to address thee, 
Lord . . . King . . . Emperor 
Spider!" 

FELT like I was getting very 
■■• small, but not a bit less visible, 
worse luck, and even with the 
Change Winds inside me to give 
me courage, I thought this was 
really too much, coming on top 
of everything else; it was simply 
unfair. 

At the same time, I realized 
it was to be expected that the big 
bosses would have been watching 
us with their unblinking beady, 
black eyes ever since we had In- 
troverted waiting to pounce if we 
should ever come out of it. I tried 
to picture what was on the other 



side of the screen and I didn't like 
the assignment. 

But in spite of being petrified, 
I had a hard time not giggling, 
like the zany at graduation exer- 
cises, at the way the other ones in 
Surgery were taking it. 

I mean the Soldiers. They each 
stiffened up like they had the old 
ramrod inside them, and their faces 
got that important look, and they 
glanced at each other and the floor 
without lowering their heads, as 
if they were measuring the dis- 
tance between their feet and men- 
tally chalking alternate sets of foot- 
prints to step into. The way Erich 
and Kaby held the Major and 
Minor Maintainers became formal; 
the way they checked their Callers 
and nodded reassuringly was posi- 
tively esoteric. Even Illy some- 
how managed to look as if he were 
on parade. 

Then from beyond the screen 
came what was, under the circum- 
stances, the worst noise I've ever 
heard, a seemingly wordless dis- 
tant-sounding howling and wail- 
ing, with a note of menace that 
made me shake, although it also 
had a nasty familiarity about it I 
couldn't place. Sid's voice broke 
into it, loud, fast and frightened. 

"Your pardon, Lord, I did not 
think . . . certes, the gravity . . . I'll 
attend to it on the instant." He 
whipped a hand and half a head 
back through the screen, but 'with- 
out looking back and snapped his 



THE BIG TIME 



133 



fingers, and before I could blink, 
Kaby had put the Minor Main* 
tainer in his hand. 

Sid went completely out of sight 
then and the howling stopped, and 
I thought that if that was the way 
a Lord Spider expressed his an- 
noyance at being subjected to in- 
correct gravity, I hoped the bosses 
wouldn't start any conversations 
with me. 

Erich pursed his lips and threw 
the other Soldiers a nod and the 
four of them marched through the 
screen as if they'd drilled a life- 
time for this moment. I had the 
wild idea that Erich might give 
me his arm, but he strode past me 
as if I were ... an Entertainer. 

I hesitated a moment then, but 
I had to see what was happening 
outside, even if I got eaten up 
for it. Besides, I had a bit of the 
thought that if these formalities 
went on much longer, even a Lord 
Spider was going to discover just 
how immune he was to confined 
atomic blast. 

I walked through the screen with 
Lili beside me. 

THE Soldiers had stopped a 
few feet in front of it. I looked 
around ahead for whatever it was 
going to turn out to be, prepared 
to drop a curtsy or whatever else, 
bar nothing, that seemed expected 
of me. 

I had a hard time spotting the 
beast. Some of the others seemed 



to be having trouble too. I saw 
Doc weaving around foolishly by 
the control divan, and Bruce and 
Beau and Sevensee and Maud on 
their feet beyond it, and I won- 
dered whether we were dealing 
with an invisible monster; ought to 
be easy enough for the bosses to 
turn a simple trick like invisibi- 
lity. 

Then I looked sharply left 
where everyone else, even glassy- 
eyed Doc, was coming to look, 
into the Door sector, only there 
wasn't any monster there or even 
a Door, but just Siddy holding 
the Minor Maintainer and grinning 
like when he is threatening to 
tickle me, only more fiendishly. 

"Not a move, masters," he cried, 
his eyes dancing, "or I'll pin the 
pack of you down, marry and 
amen I will. It is my firm pur- 
pose to see the Place blasted be- 
fore I let this instrument out of 
my hands again." 

My first thought was, " 'Sblood 
but Siddy is a real actor! I don't 
care if he didn't study under any- 
one later than Burbage, that just 
proves how good Burbage is." 

Sid had convinced us not only 
that the real Spiders had arrived, 
but earlier that the gravity in the 
edge of Stores had been a lot 
heavier than it actually was. He 
completely fooled all those Sol- 
diers, including my swelled-headed 
victorious little commandant, and 
I kind of filed away the timing 



134 




 



of that business of reaching out the 
hand and snapping the fingers 
without looking, it was so good. 

"Beauregard!" Sid called. "Get 
to the Major Maintainer and call 
headquarters. But don't come 
through Door, marry go by Re- 
fresher. I'll not trust a single De- 
mon of you in this sector with me 
until much more has been shown 
and settled." 

"Siddy, you're wonderful," I said, 
starting toward him. "As soon as 
I got the Maintainer unsnarled 
and looked around and saw your 
sweet old face—" 

"Back, tricksy trull! Not the 
breadth of one scarlet toenail 
nearer me, you Queen of Sleights 
and High Priestess of Deception!" 
he bellowed. "You least of all do 
I trust. Why you hid the Main- 
tainer, I know not, 'faith, but later 
you'll discover the truth to me or 
I'll have your gizzard." 

I could see there was going to 
have to be a little explaining. 

rkOC, touched off, I guess, by 
Sid waving his hand at me, 
threw back his head and let off 
one of those shuddery Siberian 
wolf-howls he does so blamed well. 
Sid waved toward him sharply and 
he shut up, beaming toothily, but 
at least I knew who was respon- 
sible for the Spider wail of dis- 
pleasure that Sid had either called 
for or more likely got as a gift 
of the gods and used in his act. 



Beau came circling around fast 
and Erich shoved the Major Main- 
tainer into his hands without mak- 
ing any fuss. The four Soldiers 
were looking pretty glum after 
losing their grand review. 

Beau dumped some junk off one 
of the Art Gallery's sturdy tabo- 
rets and set the Major Maintainer 
on it carefully but fast, and quick- 
ly knelt in front of it and whipped 
on some earphones and started to 
tune. The way he did it snatched 
away from me my inward glory 
at my big Inversion brainwave so 
fast, I might never have had it, 
and there was nothing in my mind 
again but the bronze bomb chest. 

I wondered if I should suggest 
Inverting the thing, but I said to 
myself, "Uh-uh, Greta, you got no 
diploma to show them and there 
probably isn't time to try two 
things, anyway." 

Then Erich for once did some- 
thing I wanted him to, though I 
didn't care for its effect on my 
nerves, by looking at his Caller 
and saying quietly, "Nine minutes 
to go, if Place time and cosmic 
time are synching." 

Beau was steady as a rock and 
working adjustments so fine that 
I couldn't even see his fingers 
move. 

Then, at the other end of the 
Place, Bruce took a few steps 
toward us. Sevensee and Maud 
followed a bit behind him. I re- 
membered Bruce was another of 



THE BIG TIME 



135 



our nuts with a private program 
for blowing up the place. 

"Sidney," he called, and then, 
when he'd got Sid's attention, "Re- 
member, Sidney, you and I both 
came down to London from Peter- 
house." 

I didn't get it. Then Bruce 
looked toward Erich with a devil- 
may-care challenge and toward 
Lili as if he were asking her "for- 
giveness for something. I couldn't 
read her expression; the bruises 
were blue on her throat and her 
cheek was puffy. 

Then Bruce once more shot 
Erich that look of challenge and 
he spun and grabbed Sevensee by 
a wrist and stuck out a foot — even 
half-horses aren't too sharp about 
infighting, I guess, and the satyr 
had every right to feel at least as 
confused as I felt — and sent him 
stumbling into Maud, and the two 
of them tumbled to the floor in a 
jumble of hairy legs and pearl- 
gray frock. Bruce raced to the 
bomb chest. 

"Y/FOST of us yelled, "Stop him, 
-L" Sid, pin him down," or some- 
thing like that — I know I did be- 
cause I was suddenly sure that he'd 
been asking Lili's pardon for blow- 
ing the two of them up — and all 
the rest of us too, the love-blinded 
stinker. 

Sid had been watching him all 
the time and now he lifted his 
hand to the Minor Maintainer, but 



then he didn't touch any of the 
dials, just watched and waited, and 
I thought, "Shaitan shave us! Does 
Siddy want in on death, too? Ain't 
he satisfied with all he knows about 
life?" 

Bruce had knelt and was twist- 
ing some things on the front of 
the chest, and it was all as bright 
as if he were under a bank of 
Klieg lights, and I was telling my- 
self I wouldn't know anything 
when the fireball fired, and not be- 
lieving it, and Sevensee and Maud 
had got unscrambled and were 
starting for Bruce, and the rest of 
us were yelling at Sid, except that 
Erich was just looking at Bruce 
very happily, and Sid was still 
not doing anything, and it was 
unbearable except just then I felt 
the little arteries start to burst in 
my brain like a string of fire- 
crackers and the old aorta pop, and 
for good measure, a couple of 
valves come unhinged in my ticker, 
and I was thinking, "Well, now I 
know what it's like to die of heart 
failure and high blood pressure," 
and having a last quiet smile at 
having cheated the bomb, when 
Bruce jumped up and back from 
the chest. 

"That does it!" he announced 
cheerily. "She's as safe as the 
Bank of England." 

Sevensee and Maud stopped 
themselves just short of knocking 
him down and I said to myself, 
"Hey, let's get a move on! I

thought heart attacks were fast" 

Before anyone else could speak, 
Beau did. He had turned around 
from the Major Maintainer and 
pulled aside one of the earphones. 

"I got headquarters," he said 
crisply. "They told me how to 
disarm the bomb — I merely said 
I thought we ought to know. What 
did you do, sir?" he called to 
Bruce. 

"There's a row of four ankhs 
just below the lock. The first to 
your left you give a quarter turn 
to the right, the second a quarter 
turn to the left, same for the 
fourth, and you don't touch the 
third." 

"That is it, sir," Beau confirmed. 

The long silence was too much 
for me; I guess I must have the 
shortest span for unspoken relief 
going. I drew some nourishment 
out of my restored arteries into 
my brain cells and yelled, "Siddy, 
I know I'm a tricksy trull and the 
High Vixen of all Foxes, but what 
the Hell is Peterhouse?" 

"The oldest college at Cam- 
bridge," he told me rather coolly. 

CHAPTER 16

THE POSSIBILITY-BINDERS 

A N hour later, I was nursing a 
-**• weak highball and a black eye 
in the sleepy-time darkness on the 
couch farthest from the piano, half 
watching the highlighted party go- 
ing on around it and the bar, while 
the Place waited for rendezvous 
with Egypt and the Battle of 
Alexandria. 

Sid had swept all our outstand- 
ing problems into one big bundle 
and, since his hand held the joker 
of the Minor Maintainer, he had 
settled them all as. high-handedly 
as if they'd been those of a bunch 
of schoolkids. 

It amounted to this: 

We'd been Introverted when 
most of the damning things had 
happened, so presumably only we 
knew about them, and we were 
all in so deep one way or another 
that we'd all have to keep quiet 
to protect our delicate com- 
plexions. 

Well, Erich's triggering the 
bomb did balance rather neatly 
Bruce's incitement to mutiny, and 
there was Doc's drinking, while 
everybody who had declared for 
the peace message had something 
to hide. Mark and Kaby I felt 
inclined to trust anywhere, Maud 
for sure, and Erich in this par- 
ticular matter, damn him. Illy I 
didn't feel at all easy about, but 
I told myself there always has to 
be a fly in the ointment — a darn 



THE BIG TIME 



137 



big one this time, and furry. 

Sid didn't mention his own dirty 
linen, but he knew we knew he'd 
flopped badly as boss of the Place 
and only recouped himself by that 
last-minute flimflam. 

Remembering Sid's trick made 
me think for a moment about the 
real Spiders. Just before I snuck 
out of Surgery, I'd had a vivid pic- 
ture of what they must look like, 
but now I couldn't get it again. 
It depressed me, not being able to 
remember — oh, I probably just 
imagined I'd had a picture, like a 
hophead on a secret-of-the-uni- 
verse kick. Me ever find out any- 
thing about the Spiders?— except 
for nervous notions like I'd had 
during the recent fracas?— what a 
laugh! 

The funniest thing (ha-ha! ) was 
that I had ended up the least- 
trusted person. Sid wouldn't give 
me time to explain how I'd de- 
duced what had happened to the 
Maintainer, and even when Lili 
spoke up and admitted hiding it, 
she acted so bored I don't think 
everybody believed her — although 
she did spill the realistic detail 
that she hadn't used partial Inver- 
sion on the glove; she'd just turned 
it inside out to make it a right and 
then done a full Inversion to get 
the lining back inside. 

TRIED to get Doc to con- 
■*• firm that he'd reasoned the 
thing out the same way I had, but 



he said he had been blacked out 
the whole time, except during the 
first part of the hunt, and he didn't 
remember having any bright ideas 
at all. Right now, he was having 
Maud explain to him twice, in de- 
tail, everything that had happened. 
I decided that it was going to take 
a little more work before my repu- 
tation as a great detective was es- 
tablished. 

I looked over the edge of the 
couch and just made out in the 
gloom one of Bruce's black gloves. 
It must have been kicked there. 
I fished it up. It was the right- 
hand one. My big clue, and was I 
sick of it! Got mittens, God for- 
bid! I slung it away and, like a 
lurking octopus, Illy shot up a ten- 
tacle from the next couch, where 
I hadn't known he was resting, and 
snatched the glove like it was a 
morsel of underwater garbage. 
These ETs can seem pretty shud- 
dery non-human at times. 

I thought of what a cold-blooded, 
skin-saving louse Illy had been, 
and about Sid and his easy sus- 
picions, and Erich and my black 
eye, and how, as usual, I'd got 
left alone in the end. My men! 

Bruce had explained about be- 
ing an A-tech. Like a lot of us, 
he'd had several widely different 
jobs during his first weeks in the 
Change World and one of them 
had been as secretary to a group of 
the minor atomics boys from the 
Manhattan - Project - Earth - Satel- 



138 




 



lite days. I gathered he'd also ab- 
sorbed some of his bothersome 
ideas from them. I hadn't quite 
decided yet what species of heroic 
heel he belonged to, but he was 
thick with Mark and Erich again. 
Everybody's men! 

Sid didn't have to argue with 
anybody; all the wild compulsions 
and mighty resolves were dead 
now, anyway until they'd had a 
good long rest. I sure could use 
one myself, I knew. 

The party at the piano was get- 
ting wilder. Lili had been danc- 
ing the black bottom on top of it 
and now she jumped down into 
Sid's and Sevensee's arms, taking 
a long time about it. She'd been 
drinking a lot and her little gray 
dress looked about as innocent on 
her as diapers would on Nell 
Gwyn. She continued her dance, 
distributing her marks of favor 
equally between Sid, Erich and the 
satyr. Beau didn't mind a bit, but 
serenely pounded out "Tonight's 
the Night"— which she'd practical- 
ly shouted to him not two minutes 
ago. 

I was glad to be out of the party. 
Who can compete with a highly 
experienced, utterly disillusioned 
seventeen-year-old really throwing 
herself away for the first time? 

SOMETHING touched my 
hand. Illy had stretched a ten- 
tacle into a furry wire to return 
me the black glove, although he 



ought to have known I didn't want 
it. I pushed it away, privately call- 
ing Illy a washed-out moronic 
tarantula, and right away I felt a 
little guilty. What right had I to 
be critical of Illy? Would my own 
character have shown to advan- 
tage if I'd been locked in with 
eleven octopoids a billion years 
away? For that matter, where did 
I get off being critical of anyone? 

Still, I was glad to be out of 
the party, though I kept on watch- 
ing it. Bruce was drinking alone 
at the bar. Once Sid had gone over 
to him and they'd had one to- 
gether and I'd heard Bruce reciting 
from Rupert Brooke those de- 
liberately corny lines, "For Eng- 
land's the one land, I know, Where 
men with Splendid Hearts may 
gd; and Cambridgeshire, of all 
England, The Shire for Men who 
Understand;" and I'd remembered 
that Brooke too had died young 
in World War One and my ideas 
had got fuzzy. But mostly Bruce 
was just calmly drinking by him- 
self. Every once in a while Lili 
would look at him and stop dead 
in her dancing and laugh. 

I'd figured out this Bruce-Lili- 
Erich business as well as I cared 
to. Lili had wanted the nest with 
all her heart and nothing else 
would ever satisfy her, and now 
she'd go to hell her own way and 
probably die of Brighfs disease 
for a third time in the Change 
World. Bruce hadn't wanted the 



THE BIG TIME 



139 



nest or Lili as much as he wanted 
the Change World and the chances 
it gave for Soldierly cavorting and 
poetic drunks; Lili's seed wasn't his 
idea of healing the cosmos; maybe 
he'd make a real mutiny some day, 
but more likely he'd stick to bar- 
room epics. 

His and Lili's infatuation 
wouldn't die completely, no mat- 
ter how rancid it looked right now. 
The real-love angle might go, but 
Change would magnify the ro- 
mance angle and it might seem to 
them like a big thing of a sort if 
they met again. 

Erich had his Kamerad, shaped 
to suit him, who'd had the guts 
and cleverness to disarm the bomb 
he'd had the guts to trigger. You 
have to hand it to Erich for hav- 
ing the nerve to put us all in a 
situation where we'd have to find 
the Maintainer or fry, but I don't 
know anything disgusting enough 
to hand to him. 

I had tried a while back. I had 
gone up behind him and said, 
"Hey, how's my wicked little com- 
mandant? Forgotten your und so 
weiter?" and as he turned, I clawed 
my nails and slammed him across 
the cheek. Thaf s how I got the 
black eye. Maud wanted to put 
an electronic leech on it, but I 
took the old handkerchief in ice 
water. Well, at any rate Erich had 
his scratches to match Bruce's not 
as deep, but four of them, and I 
told myself maybe they'd get in- 



fected—I hadn't washed my hands 
since the hunt. Not that Erich 
doesn't love scars. 

"|V1"ARK was the one who helped 
-L" me up after Erich knocked 
me down. 

"You got any omnias for that?" 
I snapped at him. 

"For what?" Mark asked. 

"Oh, for everything thaf s been 
happening to us," I told him dis- 
gustedly. 

He seemed to actually think for 
a moment and then he said, "Om- 
nia mutantur, nihil interit" 

"Meaning?" I asked him. 

He said, "All things change, but 
nothing is really lost." 

It would be a wonderful phi- 
losophy to stand with against the 
Change Winds. Also damn silly. 
I wondered if Mark really be- 
lieved it. I wished I could. Some- 
times I come close to thinking it's 
a lot of baloney trying to be any 
decent kind of Demon, even a 
good Entertainer. Then I tell my- 
self, "That's life, Greta. You've 
got to love through it somehow." 
But there are times when some of 
these cookies are not too easy to 
love. 

Something brushed the palm of 
my hand again. It was lily's ten- 
tacle, with the tendrils of the tip 
spread out like a little bush. I 
started to pull my hand away, but 
then I realized the Loon was 
simply lonely. I surrendered my 



140 




 




THE BIG TIME 



141 






hand to the patterned gossamer 
pressures of feather-talk. 

Right away I got the words, 
"Feeling lonely, Greta girl?" 

It almost floored me, I tell you. 
Here I was understanding feather- 
talk, which I just didn't, and I was 
understanding it in English, which 
didn't make sense at all. 

For a second, I thought Illy 
must have spoken, but I knew he 
hadn't, and for a couple more 
seconds I thought he was working 
telepathy on me, using the feather- 
talk as cues. Then I tumbled to 
what was happening: he was play- 
ing English on my palm like on 
the keyboard of his squeakbox, and 
since I could play English on a 
squeakbox myself, my mind trans- 
lated automatically. 

Realizing this almost gave my 
mind stage fright, but I was too 
fagged to be hocused by self-con- 
sciousness. I just lay back and let 
the thoughts come through. Ifs 
good to have someone talk to you, 
even an underweight octopus, and 
without the squeaks Illy didn't 
sound so silly; his phrasing was 
soberer. 

Cri^EELING sad, Greta girl, be- 
-*• cause you'll never under- 
stand what's happening to us all," 
Illy asked me, "because you'll 
never be anything but a shadow 
fighting shadows — and trying to 
love shadows in between the bat- 
tles? It's time you understood 



we're not really fighting a war at 
all, although it looks that way, 
but going through a kind of evo- 
lution, though not exactly the kind 
Erich had in mind. 

"Your Terran thought has a 
word for it and a theory for it — 
a theory that recurs on many 
worlds. It's about the four orders 
of life: Plants, Animals, Men and 
Demons. Plants are energy-binders 
— they can't move through space 
or time, but they can clutch energy 
and transform it. Animals are 
space-binders — they can move 
through space. Man (Terran or 
ET, Lunan or non-Lunan) is a 
time-binder — he has memory. 

"Demons are the fourth order of 
evolution, possibility-binders— they 
can make all of what might be part 
of what is, and that is their evolu- 
tionary function. Resurrection is 
like the metamorphosis of a cater- 
pillar into a butterfly: a third-or- 
der being breaks" out of the chrysa- 
lis of its lifeline into fourth-order 
life. The leap from the ripped co- 
coon of an unchanging reality is 
like the first animal's leap when 
he ceases to be a plant, and the 
Change World is the core of mean- 
ing behind the many myths of im- 
mortality. 

"All evolution looks like a war 
at first — octopoids against mono- 
poids, mammals against reptiles. 
And it has a necessary dialectic: 
there must be the thesis — we call 
it Snake — and the antithesis — 



142 




 



Spider — before there can be the 
ultimate synthesis, when all pos- 
sibilities are fully realized in one 
ultimate universe. The Change 
War isn't the blind destruction it 
seems. 

"Remember that the Serpent 
is your symbol of wisdom and the 
Spider your sign for patience. The 
two names are rightly frightening 
to you, for all high existence is a 
mixture of horror and delight. And 
don't be surprised, Greta girl, at 
the range of my words and 
thoughts; in a way, I've had a bil- 
lion years to study Terra and 
learn her languages and myths. 

"Who are the real Spiders and 
Snakes, meaning who were the 
first possibility-binders? Who was 
Adam, Greta girl? Who was Cain? 
Who were Eve and Lilith? 

"In binding all possibility, the 
Demons also bind the mental with 
the material. All fourth-order be- 
ings live inside and outside all 
minds, throughout the whole cos- 
mos. Even this Place is, after its 
fashion, a giant brain: its floor is 
the brainpan, the boundary of the 
Void is the cortex of gray matter 
— yes, even the Major and Minor 
Maintainers are analogues of the 
pineal and pituitary glands, which 
in some form sustain all nervous 
systems. 

"There's the real picture, Greta 
girl." 

The feather-talk faded out and 
lily's tendril tips merged into a 



soft pad on which I fingered, 
"Thanks, Daddy Longlegs." 

CHEWING over in my mind 
what Illy had just told me, I 
looked back at the gang around 
the piano. The party seemed to 
be breaking up; at least some of 
them were chopping away at it. 
Sid had gone to the control divan 
and was getting set to tune in 
Egypt. Mark and Kaby were there 
with him, all bursting with eager- 
ness and the vision of sanks on 
ranks of mounted Zombie bow- 
men going up in a mushroom 
cloud; I thought of what Illy had 
told me and I managed a smile 
—seems we've got to win and lose 
all the battles, every which way. 

Mark had just put on his Par- 
thian costume, groaning cheerfully, 
"Trousers again!" and was strid- 
ing around under a hat like a fur- 
lined ice-cream cone and with the 
sleeves of his metal-stuffed candys 
flapping over his hands. He waved 
a short sword with a heart-shaped 
guard at Bruce and Erich and 
told them to get a move on. 

Kaby was going along on the 
operation wearing the old-woman 
disguise intended for Benson-Car- 
ter. I got a half-hearted kick out 
of knowing she was going to have 
to cover that chest and hobble. 

Bruce and Erich weren't taking 
orders from Mark just yet. Erich 
went over and said something to 
Bruce at the bar, and Bruce got 



THE BIG TIME 



143 



down and went over with Erich to 
the piano, and Erich tapped Beau 
on the shoulder and leaned over 
and said something to him, and 
Beau nodded and yanked "Lime- 
house Blues" to a fast close and 
started another piece, something 
slow and nostalgic. 

Erich and Bruce waved to Mark 
and smiled, as if to show him that 
whether he came over and stood 
with them or not, the legate and 
the lieutenant and the comman- 
dant were very much together. 
And while Sevensee hugged Lili 
with a simple enthusiasm that 
made me wonder why Fve wasted 
so much imagination on genetic 
treatments for him, Erich and 
Bruce sang: 

"To the legion of the lost ones, to 
the cohort of the damned, 

To our brothers in the tunnels 
outside time, 

Sing three Change-resistant Zom- 
bies, raised from death and 
robot-crammed, 

And Commandos of the Spiders- 



Here's to crime! 
We're three blind mice on the 
wrong time-track, 

Hush— hush— hush! 
We've lost our now and will 
never get back, 

Hush— hush—hush! 
Change Commandos Out on the 

spree, 
Damned through all possibility, 
Ghostgirls, think kindly on such 
as we, 

Hush— hush— hush!" 

While they were singing, I 
looked down at my charcoal skirt 
and over at Maud and Lili and I 
thought, "Three gray hustlers for 
three black hussars, that's our 
speed." Well, I'd never thought of 
myself as a high-speed job, winning 
all the races— I wouldn't feel com- 
fortable that way. Come to think 
of it, we've got to lose and win 
all the races in the long run, the 
way the course is laid out. 

I fingered to Illy, "That's the 
picture, all right, Spider boy."
