THE INHABITED By RICHARD WILSON 

He had just made the voyage, 
naked through the dimension 
stratum, and he scurried into the 
first available refuge, to hover

there, gasping. 

The word "he" does not strictly 
apply to the creature, for it had 
no sex, nor are the words 



"naked," "scurried," "hover" and 
"gasping" accurate at all. But 
there are no English words to describe properly what it was and 



THE INHABITED

how it moved, except in very general terms. There are no Asiatic, 
African or European words, 
though perhaps there are mathematical symbols. But, because 
this is not a technical paper, the 
symbols have no place in it. 

He was a sort of spy, a sort of 
fifth -columnist. He had some of 
the characteristics of a kamikaze 
pilot, too, because there was no 
telling if he'd get back from his 
mission. 

Hovering in his refuge and 
gasping for breath, so to speak, 
he tried to compose his thoughts 
after the terrifying journey and 
adjust himself to his new environment, so he could get to work. 
His job, as first traveler to this 
new world, the Earth, was to 
learn if it were suitable for habitation by his fellow beings back 
home. Their world was about 
ended and they had to move or 
die. 

He was being discomfited, however, in his initial adjustment. 
His first stop in the new world — 
unfortunately, not only for his 
dignity, but for his equilibrium — 
had been in the mind of a cat. 

, TT was his own fault, really. He 
and the others had decided 
that his first in a series of temporary habitations should be in 
one of the lower order of animals. 
It was a matter of precaution — 
the mind would be easy to con


trol, if it came to a contest. Also, 
there would be less chance of running into a mind-screen and being trapped or destroyed. 

The cat had no mind-screen, 
of course; some might even have 
argued that she didn't have a 
mind, especially the human couple she lived with. But whatever 
she did have was actively at 
work, feeling the solid treebranch under her claws and the 
leaves against which her tail 
switched and seeing the halfgrown chickens below. 

The chickens were scratching 
in the forbidden vegetable garden. The cat, the runt of her litter and thus named Midge, often 
had been chased out of the garden herself, but it was no sense 
of justice which now set her little 
gray behind to wriggling in preparation for her leap. It was mischief, pure and simple, which motivated her. 

Midge leaped, and the visitor, 
who had made the journey between dimensions without losing 
consciousness, blacked out. 

When he revived, he was being 
rocketed along in an up-anddown and at the same time sideward series of motions which got 
him all giddy. With an effort he 
oriented himself so that the cat's 
vision became his, and he watched in distaste as the chickens 
scurried, scrawny wings lifted 
and beaks achirp, this way and

that to escape the monstrous cat. 

The cat never touched the 
chickens; she was content to chase 
them. When she had divided the 
flock in half, six in the pea patch 
and six under the porch, she lay 
down in the shade of the front 
steps and reflectively licked a 
paw. 

The spy got the impression of 
reflection, but he was baffledly 
unable to figure out what the cat 
was reflecting on. Midge in turn 
licked a paw, rolled in the dust, 
arched her back against the warm 
stone of the steps and snapped 
cautiously at a low-flying wasp. 
She was a contented cat. The impression of contentment came 
through very well. 

The dimension traveler got 
only one other impression at the 
moment— one of languor. 

The cat, after a prodigious pink 
yawn, went to sleep. The traveler, although he had never 
known the experience of voluntary unconsciousness, was tempted to do the same. But he fought 
against the influence of his host 
and, robbed of vision with the 
closing of the cat's eyes, he meditated. 

He had been on Earth less than 
ten minutes, but his meditation 
consisted of saying to himself in 
his own way that if he was ever 
going to get anything done, he'd 
better escape from this cat's 
mind. 



He accomplished that a few 
minutes later, when there was a 
crunching of gravel in the driveway and a battered Plymouth 
stopped and a man stepped out. 
Midge opened her eyes, crept up 
behind a row of stones bordering the path to the driveway and 
jumped delicately out at the man, 
who tried unsuccessfully to gather 
her into his arms. 

Through the cat's eyes from 
behind the porch steps, where 
Midge had fled, the traveler took 
stock of the human being it was 
about to inhabit: 

Five -feet -elevenish, thirtyish, 
blond-brown -haired, blue-summer- suited. 

And no mind-screen. 
The traveler traveled and in an 
instant he was looking down 
from his new height at the gray 
undersized cat. Then the screen 
door of the porch opened and a 
female human being appeared. 

WITH the male human impressions now his, the traveler experienced some interesting 
sensations. There was a body-tobody togetherness apparently 
called "gimmea hug" and a 
face-to-face-touching ceremony, 
"kiss." 

"Hmm," thought the traveler, 
in his own way. "Hmm." 

The greeting ceremony was followed by one that had this catechism: 



THE INHABITED 



53 



"Suppareddi?" ' 

"Onnatable." 

Then came the "eating." 

This eating, something he had 
never" done, was all right, he decided. He wondered if cats ate. 
too. Yes, Midge was under the 
gas stove, chewing delicately at 
a different kind of preparation. 

There was a great deal of eating. The traveler knew from the 
inspection of the mind he was 
inhabiting that the man was 
enormously hungry and tired almost to exhaustion. 

"The damn job had to go out 
today," was what had happened. 
"We worked till almost eight 
o'clock. I think I'll take a nap 
after supper while you do the 
dishes." 

The traveler understood perfectly, for he was a very sympathetic type. That was one reason 
they had chosen him for the 
transdimensional exploration. 
They had figured the best appli=cant for the job would be one 
with an intellect highly attuned 
to the vibrations of these others, 
known dimly through the warpview, one extremely sensitive and 
with a great capacity for appreciation. Shrewd, too, of course. 

The traveler tried to exercise 
control. Just a trace of it at first. 
He attempted to dissuade the 
man from having his nap. But his 
effort was ignored. 

The man went to sleep as soon 



as he lay down on the couch in 
the living room. Once again, as 
the eyes closed, the traveler was 
imprisoned. He hadn't realized it 
until now, but he evidently 
couldn't transfer from one mind 
to another except through the 
eyes, once he was inside. He had 
planned to explore the woman's 
mind, but now he was trapped, at 
least temporarily. 

Oh, well. He composed himself 
as best he could to await the 
awakening. This sleeping business was a waste of time. 

There were footsteps and a 
whistling noise outside. The inhabited man heard the sounds 
and woke up, irritated. He opened 
his eyes a slit as his wife told the 
neighbor that Charlie was taking 
a nap, worn out from a hard day 
at the office, and the visitor, darting free, transferred again. 

But he miscalculated and there 
he was in the mind of the neighbor. Irritated with himself, the 
traveler was about to jump to the 
mind of the woman when he was 
caught up in the excitement that 
was consuming his new host. 

"Sorry," said the neighbor. 
"The new batch of records I ordered came tojiay and I thought 
Charlie'd like to hear them. Tell 
him to come over tomorrow 
night, if he wants to hear the solidest combo since Muggsy's 
Roseland days." 

The wife said all right, George, 



54 




 



she'd tell him. But the traveler 
was experiencing the excited 
memories of a dixieland jazz 
band in his new host's mind, and 
he knew he'd be hearing these 
fantastically wonderful new 
sounds at first hand as soon as 
George got back to his turntable. 

They could hardly wait, 
George and his inhabitant both. 

HIS inhabitant had come from 
a dimension- world of vast, 
contemplative silences. There was 
no talk, no speech vibrations, no 
noise which could not be shut out 
by the turning of a mental switch. 
Communication was from mind 
to mind, not from mouth to ear. 
It was a world of peaceful silence, 
where everything had been done, 
where the struggle for physical 
existence had ended, and where 
there remained only the sweet 
fruits of past labor to be enjoyed. 

That had been the state of affairs, at any rate, up until the 
time of the Change, which was 
something the beings of the world 
could not stop. It was not a new 
threat from the lower orders, 
which they had met and overcome before, innumerable times. 
It was not a threat from outside 
— no invasion such as they had 
turned back in the past. Nor was 
it a cooling of their world or the 
danger of imminent collision with 
another. 

The Change came from within. 



It was decadence. There was 
nothing left for the beings to do. 
They had solved all their problems and could find no new ones. 
They had exhausted the intricate 
workings of reflection, academic 
hypothetica and mind-play; there 
hadn't been a new game, for instance, in the lifetime of the oldest inhabitant. 

And so they were dying of 
boredom. This very realization 
had for a time halted the creeping menace, because, as they 
came to accept it and discuss 
ways of meeting it, the peril itself 
subsided. But the moment they 
relaxed, the Change started again. 

Something had to be done. 
Mere theorizing about their situation was not enough. It was then 
that they sent their spy abroad. 

Because they had at one time 
or another visited each of the 
planets in their solar system and 
had exhausted their possibilities 
or found them barren, and because they were not equipped, 
even at the peak of their physical development, for intergalactic 
flight, there remained only one 
way to travel — in time. 

Not forward or backward, for 
both had been tried. Travel ahead 
had been discouraging — in fact, 
it had convinced them that their 
normal passage through the years 
had to be stopped. The reason 
had been made dramatically clear 
— they, the master race, did not 



THE INHABITED 



55 



exist in the future. They had vanished and the lower forms of life 
had begun to take over. 

Travel into the past would be 
even more boring than continued 
existence in the present, they realized, because they would be reliving the experiences they had 
had and still vividly remembered, 
and would be incapable of changing them. It would be both tiresome and frustrating. 

That left only one way to go — 
sideways in time, across the dimension line — to a world like 
their own, but which had devel- . 
oped so differently through the 
eons that to visit it and conquer 
the minds of its inhabitants 
would be worth while. 

In that way they picked Earth 
for their victim and sent out their 
spy. Just one spy. If he didn't 
return, they'd send another. 
There was enough time. And they 
had to be sure. 

GEORGE put a record on the 
phonograph and fixed himself a drink while the machine 
warmed up. 

The interdimensional invader 
reacted pleasurably to the taste 
and instant warming effect of the 
liquor on George's mind. 

"Ahh!" said George aloud, and 
his temporary inhabitant agreed 
with him. 

George lifted the phonograph 
needle into the groove and went 



to sit on the edge of a chair. Jazz 
poured out of the speaker and 
the man beat out the time with 
his heels and toes. 

The visitor in his mind experimented with control. He went a', 
it subtly, at first, so as not to 
alarm his host. He tried to quiet 
the beating of time with the feet. 
He .suggested that George cross 
his Tegs instead. The beating of 
time continued. The visitor urged 
that George do this little thing 
he asked; he bent-all his powers 
to the suggestion, concentrating 
on the tapping feet. There wasn't 
even a glimmer of reaction. 

Instead, there was a reverse 
effect. The pounding of music 
was insistent. The visitor relaxed. 
He rationalized and told himself 
he would try another time. Now 
he would observe this phenomenon. But he became more than 
just an observer. 

The visitor reeled with sensation. The vibrations gripped him, 
twisted him and wrung him out. 
He was limp, palpitating and 
thoroughly happy when the record ended and George got up 
immediately to put on another. 

Hours later, drunk with the 
jazz and the liquor, the visitor 
went blissfully to sleep inside 
George's mind when his host went 
to bed. 

He awoke, with George, to the 
experience of a nagging throb. 
But in a few minutes, after a 




 



shower, shave and breakfast with 
steaming coffee, it was gone, and 
the visitor looked forward to the 
coming day. 

It was George's day off and he 
was going fishing. Humming to 
himself, he got out his reel and 
flies and other paraphernalia and 
contentedly arranged them in the 
back of his car. Visions of the 
fine, quiet time he was going to 
have went through George's mind, 
and his inhabitant decided he had 
better leave. He had to get on 
with his exploration; he mustn't 
allow himself to be trapped into 
just having fun. 

But he stayed with George as 
the fisherman drove his car out 
of the garage and along a highway. The day was sunny and 
warm. There was a slight wind 
and the green trees sighed delicately in it. The birds were pleasantly vocal and the colors were 
superb. 

The visitor found it oddly familiar. Then he realized what it 
was. 

His world was like this, too. 
It had the trees, the birds, the 
wind and the colors. All were 
there. But its people h.ad long 
since ceased to appreciate them. 
Their existence had turned inward and the external things no 
longer were of interest. Yet the 
visitor, through George's eyes, 
found this world delightful. He 
reveled in its beauty, its breath


taking panorama and its balance. 
And he wondered if he was able 
to appreciate it for the first time 
now because he was 'Being active, 
although in a vicarious way, and 
participating in life, instead of 
merely reflecting on it. This would 
be a clue to have analyzed by the 
greater minds to which he would 
report. 

Then, with a wrench, the visitor chided himself. He was allowing himself to identify too 
closely with this mortal, with his 
appreciation of such diverse pursuits as jazz and fishing. He had 
to get on. There was work to be 
done. 

George waved to a boy playing 
in a field and the boy waved 
back. With the contact of their 
eyes, the visitor was inside the 
boy's mind. 

THE boy had a dog. It was a 
great, lumbering mass of affection, a shaggy, loving, prankish beast. A protector and a playmate, strong and gentle. 

Now that the visitor was in the 
boy's mind, he adored the animal, 
and the dog worshiped him. 

He fought to be rational. 
"Come now," he told himself, 
"don't get carried away." He attempted control. A simple thing. 
He would have the boy pull the 
dog's ear, gently. He concentrated, suggested. But all his efforts 
were thwarted. The boy leaped 



5B 




 



at the dog, grabbed it around the 
middle. The dog responded, 
prancing free. 

The visitor gave up. He relaxed. 

Great waves of mute, suffocating love enveloped him. He swam 
for a few minutes in a pool of joy. 
as the boy and dog wrestled, 
rolled over each other in the tall 
grass, charged ferociously with 
teeth bared and growls issuing 
from both throats, finally to subside panting and laughing on the 
ground while the clouds swept 
majestically overhead across the 
blue sky. 

He could swear the dog was 
laughing, too. 

As they lay there, exhausted 
for the moment, a young woman 
came upon them. The visitor saw 
her looking down at them, the 
soft breeze tugging at her dark 
hair and skirt. Her hands were 
thrust into the pockets of her 
jacket. She was barefoot and she 
wriggled her toes so that blades 
of grass came up between them. 

"Hello, Jimmy," she said. 
"Hello, Max, you old monster." 

The dog thumped the ground 
with his tail. 

"Hello, Mrs. Tanner," the boy 
said. "How's the baby coming?" 

The girl smiled. "Just fine, 
Jimmy. It's* beginning to kick 
a little now. It kind of tickles. 
And you know what?" 

"What?" asked Jimmy. The 



visitor in the boy's mind wanted 
to know, too. 

,"I hope it's a boy, and that he 
grows up to be just like you." 

"Aw." The boy rolled over and 
hid his face in the grass. Then 
he peered around. "Honest?" 

"Honest," she said. 

"Gee whiz." The boy was so 
embarrassed that he had to leave. 
"Me and Max are going down to 
the swimmin' hole. You wanta 
come?" 

"No, thanks. You go ahead. I 
think I'll just sit here in the Sun 
for a while and watch my toes 
curl." 

As they said good-by, the visitor traveled to the new mind. 

WITH the girl's eyes, he saw 
the boy and the dog running across the meadow and 
down to the stream at the edge 
of the woods. 

The traveler experienced a sensation of tremendous fondness as 
he watched them go. 

But he mustn't get carried 
away, he told himself. He must 
make another attempt to take 
command. This girl might be the 
one he could influence, She was 
doing nothing active; her mind 
was relaxed. 

The visitor bent himself to the 
task. He would be cleverly simple. He would have her pick a 
daisy. They were all around at 
her feet. He concentrated. Her 



THE INHABITED 



gaze traveled back across the 
meadow to the grassy knoll on 
which she was standing. She sat. 
She stretched out her arms behind her and leaned back on 
them. She tossed her hair and 
gazed into the sky. 

She wasn't even thinking of the 
daisy. 

Irritated, he gathered all his 
powers into a compact mass and 
hurled them at her mind. 

But with a swoop and a soar, 
he was carried up and away, 
through the sweet summer air, to 
a cloud of white softness. 

This was not what he had 
planned, by any means. 

A steady, warm breeze enveloped him and there was a tinkle 
of faraway music. It frightened 
him and he struggled to get back 
into contact with the girl's mind. 
But there was no contact. Apparently he had been cast out, 
against his will. 

The forces of creation buffeted 
him. His dizzying flight carried 
him through the clean air in swift 
journey from horizon to horizon, 
then up, up and out beyond the 
limits of the atmosphere, only to 
return him in a trice to the breast 
of the rolling meadow. He was 
conscious now of the steady 
growth of slim green leaves as 
they pressed confidently through 
the nurturing Earth, of the other 
tiny living things in and on the 
Earth, and the heartbeat of the 



Earth itself, assuring him with its 
great strength of the continuation 
of all things. 

Then he was back with the girl, 
watching through her eyes a butterfly as it fluttered to rest on a 
flower and perched there, gently 
waving its gaudy wings. 

He had not been cast out. The 
young woman herself had gone 
on that wild journey to the heavens, not only with her mind, but 
with her entire being, attuned to 
the rest of creation. There was a 
continuity, he realized, a oneness 
between herself, the mother-tobe, and the Universe. With her, 
then, he felt the stirrings of new 
life, and he was proud and content. 

He forgot for the moment that 
he had been a failure. 

THE soft breeze seemed to turn 
chill. The Sun was still high 
and unclouded, but its warmth 
was gone. With the girl, he felt 
a prickling along the spine. She 
turned her head slightly and, 
through her eyes, he saw, a few 
yards away in tall grass, a creeping man. 

The eyes of the man were fixed 
on the girl's body and the traveler felt her thrill of terror. The 
man lay there for a moment, 
hands flat on the ground under 
his chest. Then he moved forward, inching toward her. 

The girl screamed. Her terror 



60 




 



gripped the visitor. He was helpless. His thoughts whirled into 
chaos, following hers. 

The eyes of the creeping man 
flicked from side to side, then up. 
The visitor quivered and cringed 
with the girl when she screamed 
again. As the torrent of frightened sound poured from her 
throat, the creeping man looked 
into her eyes. Instantly the visitor was sucked into his mind. 

It was a maelstrom. A tremendous conflict was going on in it. 
One part of it was urging the 
body on in its fantastic crawl 
toward the young woman frozen 
in terror against the sky. The visitor was aware of the other part, 
submerged and struggling feebly, 
trying to get through with a message of reason. But it was handicapped. The visitor sensed these 
efforts being nullified by a crushing weight of shame. 

The traveler fought against full 
identification with the deranged 
part of the mind. Nevertheless, 
he sought to understand it, as he 
had understood the other minds 
he'd visited. But there was nothing to understand. The creeping 
man had no plan. There was no 
reason for his action. 

The visitor felt only a compulsion which said, "You must! You 
must!" 

The visitor was frightened. And 
then he realized that he was less 
frightened than the man was. The 



terror felt by the creeping man 
was greater than the fear the 
visitor had experienced with the 
girl. 

There were shouts and barking. He heard the shrill cry of a 
boy. "Go get him. Max!" 

There was a squeal of brakes 
from the road and a pounding of 
heavy footsteps coming toward 
them. 

With the man, the visitor rose 
up, confused, scared. A great 
shaggy weight hurled itself and 
a growling, sharp-toothed mouth 
sought a throat. 

A voice yelled, "Don't shoot! 
The dog's got him!" 

Then blackness. 

MERSEY." The voice summoned the visitor, huddling in a corner of the deranged 
mind, fearing contamination. 

The eyes opened, looked up at 
the ceiling of a barred cell. 

"Dr. Cloyd is here to see you," 
the voice said. 

The visitor felt the mind of his 
host seeking to close out the 
words and the world, to return to 
sheltering darkness. 

There was a rattle of keys and 
the opening of an iron door. 

The eyes opened as a hand 
shook the psychotic Mersey by 
the shoulder. The visitor sought 
escape, but the eyes avoided those 
of the other. 

"Come with me, son," the doc


THE INHABITED 



61 



tor's voice said. "Don't be frightened. No one will hurt you. We'll 
have a talk." 

Mersey shook off the hand on 
his shoulder. 

"Drop dead," he muttered. 

"That wouldn't help anything," the doctor said. "Come 
on, man." 

Mersey sat up and, through his 
eyes, the traveler saw the doctor's 
legs. Were they legs or were they 
iron bars? The traveler cringed 
away from the mad thought. 

A room with a desk, a chair, a 
couch, and sunlight through a 
window. Crawling sunlit snakes. 
The visitor shuddered. He sought 
the part of the mind that was 
clear, but he sought in vain. Only 
the whirling chaos and the distorted images remained now. 

There was a pain in the throat 
and with Mersey he lifted a hand 
to it. Bandaged — gleaming teeth 
and a snarling animal's mouth — 
fear, despair and hatred. With 
the prisoner, he collapsed on the 
couch. 

"Lie down, if you like," said 
Dr. Cloyd's voice. "Try to relax. 
Let me help you." 

"Drop dead," Mersey replied 
automatically. The visitor felt 
the tenseness of the man, the unreasoning fear, and the resentment. 

But as the man lay there, the 
traveler sensed a calming of the 
turbulence. There was an urgent 



rational thought. He concentrated 
and tried to help the man phrase 
it. 

"The girl — is she all right? Did 
I . . . ?" 

"She's all right." The doctor'c 
voice was soothing. It pushed 
back the shadows a little. "She's 
perfectly all right." 

The visitor sensed a dulled relief in Mersey's mind. The 
shadows still whirled, but they 
were less ominous. He suggested 
a question, exulted as Mersey 
attempted to phrase it: "Doctor, 
am I real bad off? Can . . . ?" 

But still the shadows. 

-"We'll work together," said the 
doctor's voice. "You've been ill, 
but so have others. With your 
help, we can make you well." 

The traveler made a tremendous effort. He urged Mersey to 
say: "I'll help, doctor. I want 
to find peace." 

- But then Mersey's voice went 
on: "I must find a new home. We 
need a new home. We can't stay 
where we are." 

THE traveler was shocked at 
the words. He hadn't intended 
them to come out that way. 
Somehow Mersey had voiced the 
underlying thoughts of his people. 
The traveler sought the doctor's 
reaction, but Mersey wouldn't 
look at him. The man's gaze was 
fixed on the ceiling above the 
couch. 



62 




 



"Of course," the doctor said. 
His words were false, the visitor 
realized; he was humoring the 
madman. 

"We had so much, but now 
there is no future," Mersey said. 
The visitor tried to stop him. He 
would not be stopped. "We can't 
stay much longer. We'll die. We 
must find a new world. Maybe 
you can help us." 

Dr. Cloyd spoke and there was 
no hint of surprise in his voice. 

"I'll help you all I can. Would 
you care to tell me more about 
your world?" 

Desperately, the visitor fought 
to control the flow of Mersey's 
words. He had opened the gate 
to the other world — how, he did 
not know — and all of his knowledge and memories now were 
Mersey's. But the traveler could 
not communicate with the disordered mind. He could only 
communicate through it, and 
then involuntarily. If he could 
escape the mind . . . but he could 
not escape. Mersey's eyes were 
fixed on the ceiling. He would 
not look at the doctor. 

"A dying world," Mersey said. 
"It will live on after us, but we 
will die because we have finished. 
There's nothing more to do. The 
Change is upon, us, and we must 
flee it or die. I have been sent 
here as a last hope, as an emissary to learn if this world is the 
answer. I have traveled among 

THE INHABITED 



you and I have found good 
things. Your world is much like 
ours, physically, but it has not 
grown as fast or as far as ours, 
and we would be happy here, 
among you. if we could control." 

rpHE words from Mersey's 
throat had come falteringly at 
first, but now they were strong, 
although the tone was flat and 
expressionless. The words went 
on: 

"But we can't control. I've 
tried and failed. At best we can 
co-exist, as observers and vicarious participants, but we must 
surrender choice. Is that to be 
our destiny — to live on, but to 
be denied all except contemplation — to live on as guests among 
you, accepting your ways and 
sharing them, but with no power 
to change them?" 

The traveler shouted at Mersey's mind in soundless fury : 
"Shut up! Shut up!" 

Mersey stopped talking. 

"Go on," said the doctor softly. 
"This is very interesting." 

"Shut up!" said the traveler 
voicelessly, yet with frantic urgency. 

The madman was silent. His 
body was perfectly still, except 
for his calm breathing. The visitor gazed through his eyes in the 
only possible direction — up at the 
ceiling. He tried another command. "Look at the doctor." 

63 



With that glance, the visitor 
told himself, he would flee the 
crazed mind and enter the doctor's. There he would learn what 
the psychiatrist thought of his 
patient's strange soliloquy — 
whether he believed it, or any 
part of it. 

He prayed that the doctor was 
evaluating it as the intricate raving of delusion. 

SLOWLY, Mersey turned his 
head. Through his eyes, the 
visitor saw the faded green carpet, the doctor's dull-black shoes, 
his socks, the legs of his trousers. 
Mersey's glance hovered there, 
around the doctor's knees. The 
visitor forced it higher, past the 
belt around a tidy waist, along 
the buttons of the opened vest to 
the white collar, and finally to 
the kindly eyes behind goldrimmed glasses. 

Again he had commanded this 
human being and had been 
obeyed. The traveler braced himself for the leap from the tortured 
mind to the sane one. 

But his gaze continued to be 
that of Mersey. 

The gray eyes of the doctor 
were on his patient, Intelligence 
and kindness were in those eyes, 
but the visitor could read nothing else. 

He was caught, a prisoner in a 
demented mind. He felt panic. 
This must be the mind-screen 



he'd been warned about. 

"Look down," the visitor commanded Mersey. "Shut your eyes. 
Don't let him see me." 

But Mersey continued to be 
held by the doctor's eyes. The 
visitor cowered back into the 
crazed mental tangle. 

Gradually, then, his fear ebbed. 
There was more likelihood that 
Cloyd did not believe Mersey's 
words than that he did. The doctor treated hundreds of patients 
and surely many of them had 
delusions as fanciful as this one 
might seem. 

The traveler's alarm simmered 
down until he was capable of appreciating the irony of the situation. 

But at the same time, he 
thought with pain, "Is it our fate 
that of all the millions of creatures on this world, we can 
establish communication only 
through the insane? And even 
then to have only imperfect control of the mind and, worse, to 
have it become a transmitter for 
our most secret thoughts?" 

It was heartbreaking. 

Dr. Cloyd broke the long silence. Pulling at his ear, he spoke 
calmly and matter-of-factly : 

"Let me see if I understand 
your problem, Mersey. You believe yourself to be from another 
world, from which you have 
traveled, although not physically. 
Your world is not a material one.

as far as its people are concerned. 
Your civilization is a mental one, 
which has been placed in danger. 
You must resettle your people, 
but this cannot be done here, on 
Earth, except in the minds of the 
mentally ill — and that would not 
be a satisfactory solution. Have 
I stated the case correctly?" 

"Yes," Mersey's voice said 
over the traveler's mental protests. "Except that it is not a 
'case,' as you call it. I am not 
Mersey. He is merely a vehicle 
for my thoughts. I am not here 
to be treated or cured, as the 
human being Mersey is. I'm here 
with a life-or-death problem affecting an entire race, and I 
would not be talking to you except that, at the moment, I'm 
trapped and confused." 

TT^HE madman was doing it 
again, the traveler thought 
helplessly — spilling out his knowledge, betraying him and "his kind. 
Was there no way to muffle him? 

"I must admit that I'm confused myself," Dr. Cloyd said. 
"Humor me for a moment while 
I think out loud. Let me consider 
this in my own framework, first, 
and then in yours, without labeling either one absolutely true or 
false. 

"You see," the doctor went on, 
"this is a world of vitality. My 
world — Earth. Its people are 
strong. Their bodies are devel
THE INHABITED 



oped as well as their minds. 
There are some who are not so 
strong, and some whose minds 
have been injured. But for the 
most part, both the mind and the 
body are in balance. Each has 
its function, and they work together as a coordinated whole. 
My understanding of your world, 
on the other hand, is that it's in 
a state of imbalance, where the 
physical has deteriorated almost 
to extinction and the mind has 
been nurtured in a hothouse atmosphere, Where, you might say, 
the mind has fed on the decay of 
the body." 

"No," said Mersey, voicing the 
traveler's conviction. "You paint 
a highly distorted picture of our 
world." 

"I theorize, of course," Dr, 
Cloyd agreed. "But it's a valid 
theory, based on intimate knowledge of my own world and what 
you've told me of yours." 

"You make a basic error, I 
think," Mersey said, speaking for 
the unwilling visitor. "You assume that I have been able to 
make contact only with this deranged mind. That is wrong. I 
have shared the experiences of 
many of you — a man, a boy, a 
woman about to bear a child. 
Even a cat. And with each of 
these, my mind has been perfectly attuned. I was able to 
share and enjoy their experiences, 
their pleasures, to love with them 

65 



and to fear, although they had 
no knowledge of my presence. 

"Only since I came to this poor 
mind have I failed to achieve true 
empathy. I have been shocked 
by his madness and I've tried to 
resist it, to help him overcome it. 
But I've failed and it apparently 
has imprisoned me. Whereas I 
was able to leave the minds of the 
others almost at will, with poor 
Mersey I'm trapped. I can't 
transfer to you, for instance, as 
I could normally from another. 
If there's a way out, I haven't 
found it. Have you a theory for 
this?" 

In spite of his distress at these 
revelations, the traveler was intrigued, now that they had been 
voiced for him, and he was eager 
to hear Dr. Cloyd's interpretation 
of them. 

The psychiatrist took a pipe 
out of his pocket, filled it, lighted 
it and puffed slowly on it until 
it was drawing well. 

"Continuing to accept your 
postulate that you're not Mersey, 
but an alien inhabiting his mind," 
the doctor said finally, "I can 
enlarge on my theory without 
changing it in any basic way. 

"Your world is not superior to 
ours, much as it may please you 
to believe that it is. Nature consists of a balance, and that balance must hold true whether in 
Sioux City, or Mars, or in the 
fourth dimension, or in your 



world, wherever that may be. 
Your world is out of balance. 
Evidently it has been going out 
of balance for some time. 

"Your salvation lies not in 
further evolution in your world — 
since your way of evolving 
proved wrong, and may prove 
fatal — but in a change in course, 
back along the evolutionary path 
to a society which developed 
naturally, with the mind and the 
body in balance. That society is 
the one you have found here, in 
our world. You found it pleasant 
and attractive, you say, but that 
doesn't mean you're suited to it. 

"Nature's harsh rules may 
have operated to let you observe 
,a way of life here that you enjoy, 
but to exclude you otherwise — 
except from a mind that is not 
well. In nature's balance, it could 
be that the refuge on this world 
most closely resembling your 
needs is in the mind of the psychotic. One conclusion could be 
that your race is mentally ill — 
by our standards, if not by yours 
— and that the type of person 
here most closely approximating 
your way of life is one with a 
disordered mind." 

"TiR. Cloyd paused. Mersey had 
no immediate reply. 
The traveler made use of the 
silence to consider this plausible, 
but frightening theory. To accept the theory would be to ac

cept a destiny of madness here 
on this world, although the doctor 
had been kind enough to draw a 
distinction between madness in 
one dimension and a mere lack 
of natural balance in another. 

Mersey again seized upon the 
traveler's mind and spoke its 
thoughts. But as he spoke, he 
voiced a conclusion which the 
traveler had not yet admitted 
even to himself. 

"Then the answer is inescapable," Mersey said, his tone flat 
and unemotional. "It is theoretically possible for all of our people 
to migrate to this world and find 
refuge of a sort. But if we established ourselves in the minds of 
your normal people, we'd be, 
without will. As mere observers, 
we'd become assimilated in time, 
and thus extinguished as a separate race. That, of course, we 
could not permit. And if we 
settled in the minds most suitable 
to receive us, we would be in the 
minds of those who by your 
standards are insane — whose destiny is controlled by the others. 
Here again we could permit no 
such fate. 

"That alone would be enough 
to send me back to my people to 
report failure. But there is something more — something I don't 
think you will believe, for all your 
ability to synthesize acceptance 
of another viewpoint." 

"And what is that?" 



"First I must ask a question. 
In speaking to me now, do you 
still believe yourself to be addressing Mersey, your fellow 
human being, and humoring him 
in a delusion? Or do you think 
you are speaking through him to 
me, the inhabitant of another 
world who has borrowed his 
mind?" 

THHE doctor smiled and took 
time to relight his pipe. 
"Let me answer you in this 
way," he said. "If I were convinced that Mersey was merely 
harboring a delusion that he was 
inhabited by an alien being, I 
would accept that situation clinically. I would humor him, as 
you put it, in the hope that he'd 
be encouraged to talk freely and 
perhaps give me a clue to his 
delusion so I could help him lose 
it. I would speak to him — or to 
you, if that were his concept of 
himself — just as I am speaking 
now. 

"On the other hand, if I were 
convinced by the many unusual 
nuances of our conversation that 
the mind I was addressing actually was that of an alien being — 
I would still talk to you as I am 
talking now." 

The doctor smiled again. "I 
trust I have made my answer 
sufficiently unsatisfactory." 

The visitor's reaction was 
spoken by Mersey. "On the con


68 




 



trary, you have unwittingly told 
me what I want to know. You'd 
want your answer to be satisfactory if you were speaking to 
Mersey, the lunatic. But because 
you'd take delight in disconcerting me by scoring a point — 
something you wouldn't do with 
a patient — you reveal acceptance 
of the fact that I am not Mersey. 
Your rules would not permit you 
to give him an unsatisfactory 
answer." 

"Not quite," contradicted Dr. 
Cloyd, still smiling. "To Mersey, 
my patient, troubled by his delusion and using all his craft to 
persuade both of us of its reality, 
the unsatisfactory answer would 
be the satisfactory one." 

MERSEY'S voice laughed. 
"Dr. Cloyd, I salute you. I 
will leave your world with a tremendous respect for you — and 
completely unsure of whether you 
believe in my existence." 
"Thank you." 

"I am leaving, you know," 
Mersey's voice replied. 

The traveler by now was resigned to letting the patient be 
his medium and speak his 
thoughts. Thus far, he had 
spoken them all truly, if somewhat excessively. The traveler 
thought he knew why, now, and 
expected Mersey to voice the 
reason for him very shortly. He 
did. 



"I'm leaving because I must 
report failure and advise my 
people to look elsewhere for a 
new home. Part of the reason for 
that failure I haven't yet mentioned : 

"Although it might appear that 
I, the visitor, am manipulating 
Mersey to speak the thoughts I 
wished to communicate, the facts 
are almost the opposite. My control over either Mersey's body or 
mind is practically nil. 

"What you have been hearing 
and what you hear even now are 
the thoughts I am thinking — not 
necessarily the ones I want you 
to know. What has happened is 
this, if I may borrow your 
theory : 

"My mind has invaded Mersey's, but his human vitality is 
too strong to permit him to be 
controlled by it. In fact, the 
reverse is true. His vitality is 
making use of my mind for its 
own good, and for the good of 
your human race. His own mind 
is damaged badly, but his healthy 
body has taken over and made 
use of my mind. It is using my 
mind to make it speak against its 
will — to speak the thoughts of an 
alien without subterfuge, as they 
actually exist in truth. Thus I 
am helplessly telling you all 
about myself and the intentions 
of my people. 

"What is in operation in Mersey is the human body's instinct 



THE INHABITED 



69 



of self-preservation. It is utilizing my mind to warn you against 
that very mind. Do you see? 
That would be the case, too, if a 
million of us invaded a million 
minds like Mersey's. None of us 
could plot successfully against 
you, if that were our desire — 
which, of course, it is — because 
the babbling tongues we inherited 
along with the bodies would give 
us away." 

The doctor no longer smiled. 
His expression was grave now. 

"I don't know," he said. "Now 
I am not sure any lcinger. I'm 
not certain that I follow you — or 
whether I want to follow you. I 
think I'm a bit frightened." 

"You needn't be. I'm going. 
I'll say good-by, in your custom, 
and thank you for the hospitality 
and pleasures your world has 
given me. And I suppose I must 
thank Mersey for the warning of 
doom he's unknowingly given my 
people, poor man. I hope you 
can help him." 

"I'll try," said Dr. Cloyd, 
"though I must say you've complicated the diagnosis considerably." 

"Good-by. I won't be back, I 
promise you." 

"I believe you," said the doctor. "Good-by." 

Mersey slumped back on the 
couch. He looked up at the ceiling, vacantly 



'OR a long time there was no 
sound in the room. 



Then the doctor said: "Mersey." 

There was no answer. The man 
continued to lie there motionless, 
breathing normally, looking at 
the ceiling. 

"Mersey," said the doctor 
again. "How do you feel?" 

The man turned his head. He 
looked at the doctor with hostility, then went back to his contemplation of the ceiling. 

"Drop dead," he muttered.
