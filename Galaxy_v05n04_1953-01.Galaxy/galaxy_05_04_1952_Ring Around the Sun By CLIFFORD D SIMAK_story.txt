Ring Around the Sun By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

WHEN he could hear Crawford's footfalls no longer, 
Vickers went to the telephone and 
lifted it and gave a number, then 
waited for the connection to be 
made. 

He'd have to tell Ann fast. He 
couldn't waste much time, for 
Crawford's wire tappers would be 
listening. She must be out and 
gone before they could reach her 
door. 

He'd say : "Will you do something for me, Ann? Will you do 
it without question, without asking why?" 

He'd say: "You remember that 
place where you asked about the 
stove? I'll meet you there." 



Then he'd say: "Get out of 
your apartment. Get out and 
hide. Stay out of sight. Right 
this minute. Not an hour from 
now. Not five minutes. Not a 
minute. Hang up this phone and 
go." 

It would- have to be fast. It 
would have to be sure. It would 
have to be blind. 

He couldn't say, "Ann, you're 
a mutant," then have her want 
to know what a mutant was and 
how he came to know and what 
it meant, while all the time the 
listeners would be moving toward her door. 

She had to go on faith. But 
would she? 

Thinking of how she might 
want to argue, how she might 
not want to go without a reason 
for her going, he felt the moisture 
trickle out of his armpits and run 
down his ribs. 

The phone was ringing now. 
He tried to recall what her apartment looked like, how the phone 
sat on the table at the end of the 
davenport, and how she would be 
coming across the room to lift 
the receiver, and in a moment he 
would hear her voice. 

The operator said, "That number doesn't answer, sir." 

"Try this one, then," he said, 
giving the operator the number 
of her office. 

He waited again and heard the 
ringing.

"That number doesn't answer, 
sir," the operator finally said. 

"Thank you," said Vickers. 

"Shall I try again?" 

"No," said Vickers. "Cancel 
the call, please." 

He had to think and plan. He 
had to try to figure out what it 
was all about. Before this, it had 
been easy to seek refuge in the 
belief that it was imagination, 
that he and the world were half 
insane, that everything would be 
all right if he'd just ignore whatever might be going on. 

He couldn't believe it any 
longer. 

For now he must accept at face 
value the story that Crawford 
had told, sitting . in this room, 
with his massive bulk bulging in 
the chair, with his face unchanging and his voice a flat monotone 
that pronounced threats, but gave 
them no inflection and also no 
life. 

He must believe in human mutation and in a world divided 
and embattled. He must believe 
even in the fairyland of childhood, for if he actually was a 
mutant, then fairyland somehow 
was a mark of it. 

TTE tried to tie together the 
implications of Crawford's 
story, tried to understand what 
it all might mean, but there 
were too many ramifications, too 
many random factors, too much 



he did not know. 

There was a world of mutants, 
men and women who were more 
than normal, persons who had 
certain human talents and certain human understandings which 
the normal men and women of 
the world had never known or, 
having known, could not utilize 
in their entirety, unable to use 
intelligently all the mighty powers which lay dormant in their 
brains. 

This was the next step up. 
This was evolution. This was 
how the human race advanced. 

"And God knows," said Vickers to the empty room, "it needs 
advancement now if it ever did." 

A band of mutants, working 
together, but working undercover 
since the normal world would 
turn on them with fang and claw 
for their very differentness if they 
revealed themselves. 

And what was this differentness? What could they hope to 
do with it? 

A few of the things he knew — 
Forever cars and everlasting razor 
blades and the light bulbs that 
did not burn out and synthetic 
carbohydrates that fed the hungry and helped to hold war at 
arm's length from the throat of 
humanity. 

But what else? Surely there 
was more than that. 

Intervention, Horton Flanders 
had said, rocking on the porch. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



105 



Some sort of intervention that 
had helped the world advance 
and then had staved off, somehow or other, the bitter, terrible 
fruits of progress wrongly used. 

Horton Flanders was the man 
who could tell him, Vickers knew. 
But where was Horton Flanders 
now? 

"They're hard to catch," Crawford had said. "You ring doorbells and wait. You send in your 
name and wait. You track them 
down and wait. And they're never 
where you think they are, but 
somewhere else." 

First, thought Vickers, plotting 
out his moves, I've got to get out 
of here and be hard to catch 
myself. 

Second, find Ann and see that 
she is hidden out. 

Third, find Horton Flanders 
and, if he doesn't want to talk, 
choke it out of him. 

He picked up the top and went 
downstairs and turned in his key. 
The clerk got out his bill. 

"I have a message for you," 
said the clerk, reaching back into 
the pigeonhole that held the key. 
"The gentleman who was up to 
see you a while ago gave it to 
me before he left." 

He handed across an envelope 
and Vickers ripped it open, pulled out a folded sheef. 

"A funny kind of business," 
said the clerk. "He'd just been 
talking to you." 



"Yes," said Vickers, "it is a 
funny kind of business." 

The note read: Don't try to 
use that car of yours. If anything happens, keep your mouth 
shut. 

It was a very funny kind of 
business. 

XXV 

VICKERS drove toward the 
dawn. The road was deserted 
and the car ran like a fleeing 
thing, with no sound but the 
whistle of the tires as they hugged 
the pavement on the curves. Beside him, on the seat, the gaily 
painted top rolled back and forth 
to the motion of the car. 

There were two things wrong, 
two immediate things: 

He should have stopped at the 
Preston house. 

He should not have used the 
car. 

Both, of course, were foolish, 
and he berated himself for thinking of them. He pushed the accelerator down so that the whistle 
of the tires became a high, shrill 
scream as they took the curves. 

He should have stopped at the 
Preston house and tried out the 
top. That, he told himself, was 
what he had planned to do, and 
he searched in his mind for the 
reasons that had made him plan 
it that way, but there were no 
reasons. If the top worked, it 



106 




 



would work anywhere and that 
was all there could be to it. It 
wouldn't matter where it worked, 
although deep inside him was a 
feeling that it did matter to him, 
at least, where it worked. There 
was something special about the 
Preston house. It was a key point 
— it must be a key point in this 
mystery of mutants. 

I couldn't take the time, he 
argued with himself. The first 
job is to get back to New York 
and find Ann and get her out of 
sight. 

For Ann, he told himself, must 
be the other mutant, although 
once again, as with the Preston 
house, he could not be entirely 
sure. There was no reason, no 
substantial proof, that Ann Carter was a mutant. 

Reason^ he thought. Reason 
and proof. And what are they? 
No more than the orderly logic 
on which Man has built his 
world. Could there be inside a 
man another sense, another yardstick by which one could live, 
setting aside the matter of reason 
and of proof as childish things 
which once had been good 
enough, though clumsy at the 
best? Could there be a way of 
knowing right from wrong, good 
from bad, without the endless 
reasoning and the dull parade of 
proof? Intuition? That was female nonsense. Premonition? 
That was superstition. 



And yet were they really female nonsense and superstition? 
For years researchers had concerned themselves with extrasensory perception, a sixth sense 
that Man might hold within himself, but had been unable to 
develop to its full capacity. 

And if extra-sensory perception 
were possible, then many other 
abilities were possible as well — 
the psycho -kinetic control of objects through the power of mind 
alone, the ability to look into 
the future, the recognition of time 
as something other than the 
movement of the hands upon a 
clock, the ability to know and 
manipulate unsuspected dimensional extensions of the spacetime continuum. 

TMVE senses, Vickers thought — 
the sense of smell, of sight, 
of hearing, of taste and touch. 
Those were the five that Man 
had known since time immemorial, but did it mean that was all 
he had? Were there other senses 
waiting in his mind for development, as the opposable thumb, 
the erect posture and logical 
thinking had been developed 
throughout the millenia of Man's 
existence? He had evolved from 
a tree -dwelling, fear -shivering 
thing into a club -carrying animal, 
into a fire-making animal. He 
had made, first of all, the simplest of tools, then more complex 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



107 



tools, and finally tools so complex that they were machines. 

All of this had been done as 
the result of developing intelligence. Was it not possible that 
the development of intelligence, 
the development of the human 
senses, was not finished yet? And 
if this were true, why not a sixth 
sense, or a seventh, or an eighth, 
or any number of additional 
senses, which would come under 
the general heading of the natural evolution of the human 
race? 

Was that, Vickers wondered, 
what had happened to the mutants, the sudden development of 
these additional and only halfsuspected senses? Was not the 
mutation logical in itself — the 
thing that one might well expect? 

He swirled through little villages still sleeping between the 
night and dawn and went past 
farm houses lying strangely naked 
in the half light that ran on the 
eastern skyline. 

Don't try to use the car, Crawford's note had read. And that 
was foolish, too, for there was 
no reason why he should not use 
the car. No reason other than 
Crawford's saying so. And who 
was Crawford? An enemy? Perhaps, although at times he didn't 
act like one. A man who was 
afraid of the defeat that he felt 
sure would come, more fearful, 
seemingly, of the commission of 



defeat than of defeat itself. 

Reason once again. 

No reason why he should not 
use the car. But he was faintly 
uneasy, using it. 

No reason why he should have 
stopped at the Preston house and 
still, in his heart, he felt he had 
somehow failed by not stopping 
there. 

No reason to believe Ann Carter was a mutant, and yet he 
was sure she was. 

He drove through the morning, 
with the fog rising from all the 
little streams he crossed, with the 
flush of sun against the eastern 
sky, with, finally, boys and dogs 
going after cows, and the first 
traffic on the road. 

He suddenly realized that he 
was hungry and a little sleepy, 
but he couldn't stop to sleep. He 
had to keep on going. When it 
became dangerous to drive, he 
would have to sleep, but not until then, and then not for long. 

But he'd have to stop somewhere to eat. At the next town 
he came to, if it had an eating 
place that was open, he would 
stop and eat. Perhaps a cup or 
two of coffee would chase away 
the sleep. 

XXVI 

TPHE town was large and there 
were eating places and people 
on the street, the six o'clock fac



 



tory workers on the way to their 
seven o'clock jobs. 

He picked out a restaurant 
that didn't look too bad, that had 
less of the cockroach look about 
it than some of the others, and 
slowed to a crawl, looking for a 
parking place. He found one a 
block away. 

He parked and got out, locked 
the door. Standing on the sidewalk, he sniffed the morning. It 
still was fresh, with the deceptive 
coolness of a summer morning. 

He'd have breakfast, he told 
himself, take his time eating it, 
give himself a chance to relax, 
to let some of the road fatigue 
drop from his bones. 

TlfAYBE he'd ought to call 
■L" Ann again. This morning he 
might catch her in. He'd feel 
safer if she knew and if she were 
in hiding. Perhaps instead of just 
meeting him at the place where 
they sold the houses, she should 
go there and explain to them 
what the situation was and they 
might help her. But to explain 
that to Ann would take too long. 
He had to tell her fast and she 
had to go on faith. 

He went back down the street 
and turned in at the restaurant 
door. There were tables, but no 
one seemed to be using them. AH 
the eaters were bellied up to the 
counter. There were a few stools 
still left and Vickers took one. 



On the left side of him, a 
husky workman in faded shirt 
and bulging overalls was noisily 
slurping up a bowl of oatmeal, 
head bent close above the bowl, 
shoveling the cereal into hie 
mouth with a rapidly moving 
spoon that dipped and lifted, 
dipped and lifted, almost as if 
the man were attempting to establish a siphoning flow of the 
food into his mouth. On the other 
side sat a man in blue slacks and 
white shirt with a neat black 
bow. He wore glasses and he read 
a paper and he was, from the 
look of him, a bookkeeper or 
something of the sort, a man 
handy with a column of figures 
and very smug about it. 

A waitress came and mopped 
the counter in front of Vickers 
with a wet cloth. 

"What'll you have?" she asked 
impersonally, running the question together into a single word. 

"Stack of cakes," said Vickers, 
"with a side of ham." 

"Coffee?" 

"Coffee." 

The breakfast came and he ate 
it, hurriedly at first, stuffing his 
mouth with great forkfuls of 
syrup -dripping cakes, with generous cuts of ham, then more 
slowly as the bite of hunger was 
appeased. 

The overalled man got up and 
left. A girl with drooping eyelids 
took his place. Some weary sec


RING AROUND THE SUN 



retary, Vickers thought, with 
only an hour or two of sleep 
after a night out. 

He was almost through eating 
when he heard the shouting in 
the street outside, then the sound 
of running feet. 

The girl beside him swung 
around on her stool and looked 
out the window. 

"Everybody's running," she 
said. "I wonder what's the 
trouble." 

A man stopped outside the door 
and yelled, "They found one of 
them Forever cars!" 

EVERYBODY leaped from the 
stools and surged toward the 
door. Vickers followed slowly. 

They'd found a Forever car, 
the shouting man had said. The 
only one they could have found 
was the one Vickers had parked 
just up the street. 

They had tipped the car over 
and rolled it out into the middle 
of the road. They were ringed 
around it, shouting and shaking 
their fists. Someone threw a brick 
or stone at it and the sound of 
the object striking its metal 
boomed through the early morning street like a cannon shot. 

Someone picked up whatever 
had been thrown and heaved it 
through the door of a hardware 
store. Reaching in through the 
broken glass, someone else unlocked the door. Men streamed 



in and came out again, carrying 
mauls and axes. 

The crowd drew back to give 
them elbow room. The mauls and 
axes flashed in the slanted sunlight. They struck and struck 
again. Glass shattered with a 
crunching sound, then came the 
metallic clanging and denting. 

Vickers stood beside the restaurant door, sick in the pit of 
his stomach, his brain frozen 
with what later might be fear, 
but which now was no more than 
astonishment and blind befuddlement. 

Crawford had written: Don't 
try to use that cars of yours. 

This was what he'd meant. 

Crawford had known what 
would happen to any Forever 
car found parked upon the street. 

Crawford had known and tried 
to warn him. 

Friend or foe? 

Vickers reached out a hand 
and put it, palm flat, against the 
rough brick of the building. 

The touch of the brick, the 
roughness of it, told him that this 
was happening, that it was no 
dream, that he actually stood 
here, in front of a restaurant in 
which he had just eaten breakfast, and saw a mob, mad with 
hate, smashing up his car. 

The people finally know. 
They've been told about the mutants. 

And they hate the mutants. 



110 




 



Of course they hate them, because the existence of the mutants makes them second-class 
humans, because they are Neanderthalers suddenly invaded by 
a bow and arrow people. 

He turned and went back into 
the restaurant, ready to leap and 
run if someone should suddenly 
shout behind him, if a finger 
tapped his shoulder. 

The bespectacled man with the 
black bow tie had left the paper 
beside his plate. Vickers picked 
it up, walked steadily on, down 
the length of counter. He pushed 
open the swinging door that led 
into the kitchen. There was no 
one there. He walked through 
the kitchen rapidly, let himself 
out the rear door into an alley. 

He went down the alley, found 
another narrow one between two 
buildings, leading to an opposite 
street. He took it, crossed the 
street when he came to it, followed another alleyway between 
two buildings that led to another 
alley. 

"They'll fight," Crawford had 
said, sitting in the hotel room 
the night before, his big body 
filling the chair to overflowing. 
"They'll fight with what they 
have." 

So now they were fighting, 
striking with what they had. They 
had picked up their club and 
were fighting back. 

He found a park and walking 



through it. came across a bench 
shielded from the street by a 
clump of bushes. He sat down 
and unfolded the paper he had 
taken from the restaurant, turned 
its pages back until he found the 
front page. 

And there the story was.

MEN REVEALED. 

And the deck : Superhuman 
Race Among Us; Mystery of 
Everlasting Razor Blades Solved. 

And the story: 

w A SHINGTON ( Special) - The 
greatest danger the human race has 
faced in all the years of its existence—a danger which may reduce 
all of us to slavery— was revealed 
today in a joint announcement by 
the Federal Bureau of Investigation, 
the military chiefs of staff and the 
Washington office of the International Bureau of Economics. 

The joint announcement was 
made at a news conference called 
by President Humphrey. 

Simultaneous announcements were 
made in all the other major capitals of the world-London, Moscow, 
Paris, Madrid, Rome, Cairo, Peking 
and a dozen other cities. 

The announcement revealed that 
a new race of human beings, called 
mutants, has developed, and is 
banded together in an attempt to 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



111 



win domination over the entire 
world. 

A mutant, in the sense in which 
it is here used, is a human being 
who has undergone a sudden variation, the child differing from the 
parent, as opposed to the gradual 
change by which the human race 
has evolved to its present form. 
The variation, in this case, has not 
been noticeably physical; that is, 
a mutant is indistinguishable, so 
far as the eye is concerned, from 
any other human. The variation has 
been mental, with the mutant possessing certain skills which the normal human does not have— certain 
"wild talents," the announcement 
said. 

(See adjoining column for full explanation of mutancy.) 

The announcement (full text in 
column 4) said that . the mutants 
had embarked upon a campaign to 
destroy the economic system of the 
world through the manufacture of 
certain items, such as the everlasting razor blade, the everlasting light 
bulb, the Forever car, the new prefabricated houses and the items 
generally sold in the so-called "gadget shops." 

The mutant group, it was revealed, has been under investigation 
by various governmental and independent agencies for several years 
and the findings, when correlated, 
showed unmistakably that a definite 
campaign was under way to take 
over the entire world. The formal 
announcement of the situation, it 
was said, was delayed until there 
could be no doubt concerning the 
authenticity of the reports. 



The announcement called upon 
the citizenry of the world to join in 
the fight to circumvent the plot At 
the same time it pleaded for a normal continuation of all activity and 
advised against hysteria. 

"There is no occasion for apprehension," the announcement said. 
"Certain countermeasures are being 
taken." There was no hint as to 
what any of these countermeasures 
might be. When the reporter attempted to question the spokesman 
concerning them, he was told that 
this was restricted information. 

To aid the world governments in 
their campaign against the intentions 
of the mutants, the announcement 
said that every citizen should take 
these steps: 

1— Keep your head. Do not give 
way to hysteria. 

2— Refrain from using any mutant-manufactured items. 

3— Refuse to buy any mutantmanufactured items. Persuade others 
against their use or purchase. 

4— Immediately inform the FBI 
of any suspicious circumstances 
which might have a bearing upon 
the situation. 

The announcement said that first

some professor of biology, dis

cussing the probable effects of 
mutation and its hypothetical 
causes. 

There were a half a dozen bulletins. They read : 

new YORK (AP) - Mobs today 
swept through the city armed with 
axes and iron bars. They swarmed 
into gadget shops, destroying the 
merchandise, smashing the fixtures. 
Apparently no one was found in 
any of the shops. One man was 
killed, but it was not believed he 
was connected with a gadget shop. 

WASHINGTON (UP) -A mob early 
today attacked and killed a man 
driving a Forever car. The car was 
smashed. 

LONDON (INS)-The government 
today threw a heavy guard around 
several housing development projects containing a number of the 
prefabricated houses attributed to 
mutant manufacture. 

"The people who purchased these 
houses," said an explanation accompanying the order, "purchased them 
in good faith. They are in no way 
connected or to be connected with 
the conspiracy. The guards were 
ordered to protect these innocent 
people and their neighbors against 
any misdirected public violence." 

St. Malo, France (Reuters) The 
body of a man was found hanging 
from a lamp post at dawn today. A 
placard with the crude lettering of 
"Mutant" was pinned to his shirt 
front. 



VICKERS let the paper fall 
from his hand. It made a 
ragged tent upon the ground. 

He stared out across the park. 
Morning traffic was flowing by 
on the roadway a block away. 
A boy came along a walk, bouncing a ball as he walked. A few 
pigeons circled down through the 
trees and strutted on the grass, 
cooing absently. 

Normal, he thought. A normal 
morning, with people going to 
work and kids out playing and 
the pigeons strutting on the grass. 

But underneath it was a current of savagery. Behind it all, 
behind the facade of civilization, 
the present was crouching in the 
cave, lying in ambush against 
the coming of the future. Lying 
in wait for himself and Ann and 
Horton Flanders. 

Thank God, he thought, that 
no one had thought to connect 
him with the car. Perhaps, later 
on, someone would. Someone 
might remember seeing him get 
out of the car. Perhaps someone 
would fasten suspicion upon the 
man who, of all of them, had not 
run out of the restaurant and 
joined the mob around the car. 

But for the moment he was 
safe. How long he would remain 
safe was another matter. 
Now what? 
He considered it. 
Steal a car and continue his 
trip? 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



113 



He didn't know how to steal 
a car; he would probably bungle 
it. 

But there was something else 
— something that needed doing 
right away. 

He had to get the top. 

He had left it in the car and 
he'd have to. get it back. 

But why risk his neck to get 
the top? 

It didn't make much sense. 
Come to think of it, it made no 
sense at all. Still, he knew he had 
to do it. 

Crawford's warning about not 
driving the car hadn't made 
sense, either, at the time he read 
it He had disregarded it and felt 
uneasy about disregarding it, had 
known, against all logic, that he 
was wrong in not paying it attention. And in this particular 
case, at least, logic had been 
wrong and his feeling — his hunch, 
his premonition, his intuition, 
call it what you would — had 
been right. 

He had wondered, he remembered, if there might not be a 
certain sense which would outweigh logic and reason, if within 
his brain a man might not have 
another ability, a divining faculty, which would outdate the old 
tools of logic and of reason. 

Maybe that was the sense 
that told him, without reason, 
without logic, that he must get 
back the top. 



XXVIII 

THE street had been blocked 
to traffic and the police were 
standing by, although there was 
little need of them, it seemed, 
for the crowd was orderly. The 
car lay in the middle of the 
street, battered and dented, with 
its wheels sticking into the air, 
like a dead cow in a cornfield. 
Its glass was shattered and strewed about the pavement, crunching under the feet of the milling 
crowd. Its tires were knocked off 
and the wheels were bent and 
people stood around and stared 
at it. 

Vickers mingled with the 
crowd, moving nearer to the car. 
The front door, he saw, had 
somehow been smashed open and 
was wedged against the pavement. There was just a chance, 
he told himself, that the top 
might still be there. 

If it was, he would have to 
figure out some way to get it. 
Maybe he could get down on his 
knees and pretend he was simply 
curious about the instrument 
panel or the controls. He'd tell 
his neighbors about how the control panel differed from that of 
an ordinary car and maybe he 
could hook in a hand and sneak 
out the top and hide it underneath his coat without any of 
them knowing. 

He shuffled about the wreck, 



114 




 



gaping at it in what he hoped 
was an idly curious fashion as 
he talked a little with his neighbors, the usual banal comments 
of the onlooker. 

He worked his way around until he was beside the door and 
squatted down and looked inside 
the car and he couldn't see the 
top. He stayed there, squatting 
and looking, craning his neck, 
and he told his nearest neighbor 
about the control panel and wondered about the shift, though all 
the time he was looking for the 
top. 

But there wasn't any top. 

He got up again and milled 
with the crowd, watching the 
pavement, because the top might 
have fallen from the car and rolled away from it. Maybe it had 
rolled into the gutter and was 
lying there. He searched the gutters on both sides of the streets, 
and covered the pavement, but 
there was no top. 

So the top was gone — gone before he could try it out, and now 
he'd never know if it could take 
him into fairyland. 

Twice he had gone into fairyland — once when he was a child 
and again when he had walked 
a certain valley with a girl 
named Kathleen Preston. He had 
walked with her in an enchanted 
valley that could have been 
nothing else but another fairyland, and after that he had gone 



back to see her and had been told 
that she had gone away, and he 
had turned from the door and 
trudged across the porch. 

"Now wait!" he said. Had he 
turned from the door and trudged across the porch? 

HE tried to remember and, 
dimly, he saw it all again, 
the soft-voiced man who had told 
him that Kathleen was gone and 
then had said. "But won't you 
come in, lad? I have something 
you should see." 

He had gone in and stood in 
the mighty hall, filled with heavy 
shadow, with its paintings on the 
wall and the massive stairs 
winding up to the other stories 
and the man had said — 
What had he said? 
Or had it ever happened? 
Why did an experience like 
this, an incident that he should 
have remembered without fail, 
come back to him after all the 
years of not knowing, as the lost 
memory of his boyhood venture 
into fairyland had come back to 
him after so long? 

And was it true or wasn't it? 
There was no way that he 
could judge. 

He turned away and walked 
down the street, past the policeman who leaned against a building and swung his club, smiling 
at the crowd. 

In a vacant lot, a group of 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



115 



boys were playing and he stopped 
to watch them. Once he had 
played like that, without thought 
of time or destiny, with the 
thought of nothing but happy 
hours of sunshine and the delight 
that bubbled up with living, for 
the day always ran on forever. 

There was one little fellow who 
sat apart from all the others. He 
held something in his lap and 
was turning it around, admiring 
it, happy in the possession of a 
wondrous toy. 

Suddenly he tossed it in the 
air and caught it and the sun 
flashed on its many colors. Vickers, seeing what it was, skipped 
a breath or two. 

It was the missing top! 

He left the sidewalk and sauntered across the lot. 

The playing boys did not notice him or, rather, they ignored 
him, after the manner of the 
playing youngster for whom the 
adult does not exist, or is no 
more than a shadowy personage 
out of some unreal and unsatisfactory world. 

Vickers stood above the boy 
who held the top. 

"Hello, son." 

"Hello yourself." 

"What you got?" 

"I found it," said the boy. 

"It's a pretty thing," said Vickers. "I'd like to buy it from you." 

"It ain't for sale." 

"I'd pay quite a bit," said 



Vickers, feeling desperate. 

*The boy looked up with interest. 

"Enough for a new bicycle?" 

Vickers dug into his pocket 
and pulled out folded bills. 

"Gosh, mister . . ." 

Out of the corner of his eye, 
Vickers saw the policeman standing on the sidewalk, watching 
him. The policeman took a step, 
started across the lot. 

"Here," said Vickers. 

He grabbed the top and tossed 
the folded bills into the boy's lap. 
He straightened and ran, heading 
for the alley. 

"Hey, you !" the policeman 
shouted. 

Vickers kept on running. 

A gun exploded and Vickers 
heard the thin, high whine of a 
bullet going high over his head. 

REACHING the first of the 
buildings in the alley, Vickers ducked around it, into a passageway between two buildings 
and realized that he'd turned in 
the wrong direction. The passageway would lead him back to 
the street on which lay the wrecked and battered car. 

He saw an open basement window, gauged his distance and 
threw himself feet first through 
the window. The sill caught him 
in the back and he felt the fire 
of pain run along his body. Then 
his head smacked into something 



116 




 



and the basement was a place 
■of darkness filled with a million 
stars. He came down sprawling 
and the wind was knocked out 
of him and the top, flying from 
his hand, bounced along the floor. 

He clawed himself to his hands 
and knees and grabbed the top. 
He found a water pipe, grasped 
it and pulled himself erect. There 
was a raw place on his back that 
burned and his head buzzed with 
the violence of the blow. But he 
was safe, at least for a little 
while. 

He found stairs and climbed 
them and saw that he was in the 
back room of a hardware store. 
The place was filled with haphazardly piled rolls of chicken 
wire, rolls of roofing paper, cardboard cartons, bales of binder 
twine, lengths of stove pipe, crated stoves, coils of manila rope. 

He could hear people moving 
around up in front, but there was 
no one in sight. He ducked behind a crated stove and from the 
window above his head, a splash 
of sun came down, so that 
he crouched in a pool of light. 

Outside, in the alleyway, he 
heard running feet go past and 
from far away he heard men 
shouting. He hunched down, 
pressing his body against the 
rough board crating of the stove 
and tried to control his labored 
breathing, afraid that anyone 
corning into the room might hear 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



his rasping breath. 

He'd have to figure out some 
way to get away. If he stayed 
where he was, they finally would 
find him. They would start combing the area, police and citizen 
alike. And, by that time, they 
would know who it was they 
hunted. The boy would tell them 
he found the top lying near the 
car and someone then might remember seeing him park the car 
and the waitress in the restaurant 
might tell them how he stayed 
while the others raced outside. 
From many little bits of information, they would know their fugitive was the man whose Forever 
car they'd smashed. 

He wondered what would happen to him when they found him, 
but he knew well enough, remembering the bulletin from St. 
Malo, about the man hanging 
from the lamp post with a placard on his chest. 

But there was no way to escape. He couldn't sneak out into 
the alley, for they'd be watching 
for him. He could go back into 
the basement, but that wasn't 
any better than where he was. 
He could saunter into the store 
and act like a customer, finally 
walk out to the street, doing his 
best to look like an ordinary 
citizen who had dropped into the 
place to look at some gun or tool. 
But he doubted that he could 
carry it off. 

• 117 



So the illogic hadn't paid off, 
after all. Logic and reason were 
still the winners. There was no 
escape from this sunlit refuge behind the crated stove. 

There was no escape, unless — 

He had found the top again. 
He had it there with him. 

There was no escape — unless 
the top should work. 

HE put the top's point on the 
floor and slowly pumped the 
handle. It picked up speed. He 
let go and it spun, whistling. He 
knelt in front of it and watched 
the colored stripes. He saw them 
come into being and he followed 
them into infinity and he wondered where they went. He forced 
his attention on the top, narrowing it down until the top was all 
he saw. 

It didn't work. The top wobbled and he put out a hand and 
stopped it. 

He tried again. 
He had to be an eight-yearold. He must clear away his 
mind, sweep out all adult 
thoughts, all adult worry, all sophistication. He must become a 
child. 

He thought of playing in the 
sand, of napping under trees, of 
the feel of soft grass beneath bare 
feet. He closed his eyes and concentrated and caught the vision 
and the color and the smell of it. 

He opened his eyes and watch


ed the stripes and filled his mind 
with wonder, with the question 
of their being and where they 
went when they disappeared. 
It didn't work. 

The top wobbled and he stopped it. 

A frantic thought wedged its 
way into his consciousness. He 
didn't have much time. He had 
to hurry. 

He pushed the thought away. 

A child had no conception of 
time. He was a little boy and he 
had all the time there was and 
he owned a brand-new top. 

He spun it again. 

He knew the comfort of a 
home and loved parents and the 
playthings scattered on the floor 
and the story books that Grandma would read to him when she 
came visiting again. And he 
watched the top with a simple, 
childish wonder — watching the 
stripes come up and disappear, 
come up and disappear, come up 
and disappear — 

TIE fell a foot or so and thumped upon the ground and he 
was sitting atop a hill. The land 
stretched out before him for 
miles and miles and miles, an 
empty land of waving grass and 
groves of trees and far-off, winding water. 

He looked down at his feet and 
the top was there, slowly spinning 
to a wobbling halt. 



118 




 



XXIX 

NEW and empty of any mark 
of Man, the land was raw 
of earth and sky. Even the wildness of the wind that swept across 
it seemed to say that the land 
was untamed. 

From his hilltop, Vickers saw 
bands of dark, moving shapes 
that he felt sure were small herds 
of buffalo. Even as he watched 
three wolves came loping up the 
slope, saw him and veered ofT, 
angling down the hill. In the blue 
sweep of sky that arched from 
horizon to horizon without a 
single cloud, a bird wheeled 
gracefully, spying out the land. 
It screeched and the screech 
came down to Vickers as a high, 
thin sound filtered through the 
sky. 

The top had brought him 
through. He was safe in this 
empty land with wolves and buffalo. 

He climbed to the ridgetop and 
looked across the reaches of the 
grassland, with its frequent groves 
and many watercourses, sparkling in the sun. There was no 
sign of human habitation — no 
roads, no threads of smoke sifting up to the sky. 

He looked at the sun and wondered which way was west and 
thought he knew, and if he was 
right, the sun said it was midmorning. But if he was wfong, it 



was afternoon and in a few hours 
darkness would come upon the 
land. And when darkness came, 
he would have to figure out how 
to spend the night. 

He had meant to go into fairyland. If he had stopped to think 
about it, he told himself, he 
would have known that it would 
not be, for the place he had gone 
to as a child could not have been 
fairyland. This was a new and 
empty. world, lonely and perhaps 
dangerous, but it was better than 
the back room of a hardware 
store in some unknown town 
with his fellow men hunting him 
to death. 

He sat down and emptied his 
pockets and made an inventory 
of what he had. A half a package 
of cigarettes; three packs of 
matches, one almost finished, one 
full, one with just a match or 
two gone from it; a pocket knife; 
a handkerchief; a billfold with 
some bills in it; a few cents in 
change; the key to the Forever 
car; a ring with the keys to the 
house and another to his desk 
and a couple of other keys he 
couldn't identify; a mechanical 
pencil; a few half sheets of paper 
folded together, pocket size, on 
which he had intended to make 
notes if he saw anything worth 
noting — and that was all. Fire 
and a tool with a cutting edge 
and paper money less useful than 
the blank paper and worthless 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



119 



bits of metal. 

If this world was empty, he 
must feed himself and defend 
himself and find shelter and, in 
time to come, contrive some way 
in which to clothe himself. 

He lit a cigarette and tried to 
think, but all he could think 
about was that he must go easy 
on the cigarettes, for the half 
pack was all he had and when 
those were gone, there would be 
no more. 

An alien land — but not entirely alien, for it was Earth again, 
the old familiar Earth unscarred 
by the tools of Man. It had the 
air of Earth and the grass and 
sky of Earth, and even the wolves 



and buffalo were the same as old 
Earth had borne. Perhaps it was 
Earth. It looked for all the world 
as the primal Earth mfght have 
looked before Man had stripped 
and gutted it and torn all its 
treasures from it. 

IT was no alien land — no alien 
dimension into which the top 
had flung him, although, of 




course, the top hadn't had anything to do with it. It was simply 
something on which one focused 
one's attention, a hypnotic device to aid the mind in the job 



120 




 



which it must do. The top had 
helped him come into this land, 
but it had been his mind and 
that strange otherness that 




his which had enabled him to 
travel from old familiar Earth to 
this strange, primal world. 

There was something he had 
heard or read. 

He went searching for it, digging back into his brain with 
frantic mental fingers. 

A news story? Something he 
had heard? Or something he had 
seen on television? 

It came to him finally — the 
article about the man in Boston 
— a Dr. Aldridge, he seemed to remember who had said that there 
might be more worlds than one, 
that there might be an Earth a 
second ahead of ours and one a 
second behind ours and another 
a second behind that and still 
another and another and another, 



a long string of worlds whirling 
one behind the other, like men 
walking in the snow, one man 
putting his foot into the other's 
track and the one behind him 
putting his foot in the same track 
and so on down the line. 

A ring around the Sun. 

He hadn't finished reading the 
story, he recalled, for something 
had distracted him and he'd laid 
the paper aside. He wished he 
hadn't. For Aldridge might have 
been right. 

This might be the next world 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



121 



after the old, familiar Earth. 

He tried to puzzle out the logic 
of why there should be a ring 
of worlds around the Sun, but 
he gave it up, for he had no idea. 

Say, then, that this was Earth 
No. 2, the next earth behind the 
original Earth which he had left 
behind. Say that in topographical 
features the earths would resemble one another, not exactly like 
one another, perhaps, but very 
close in their topography, with 
little differences here and there, 
each magnified in turn until 
probably a matter of ten earths 
back, the change would become 
noticeable. But this was only the 
second earth and its features 
might be but little changed and 
on old Earth he had been somewhere in Illinois and this was 
the kind of land that ancient 
Illinois would have been. 

He had gone into fairyland and 
there had been a garden and a 
house in a grove of trees and 
maybe this was the very earth 
he had visited when he was a 
boy of eight. And in later years 
he had walked an enchanted valley and it, too, might have been 
this earth, and if that was true, 
then there was a Preston house 
exactly like the one which stood 
so proudly in the Earth of his 
childhood. 

He knew there was little reason 
to believe there'd be a Preston 
house, little reason to think any


thing other than that he was 
trapped in an empty, lonely 
world. But he shut his mind to 
reason, for the hope that there 
was a Preston house was the only 
hope there was. 

He checked the Sun and saw 
that it had climbed higher in the 
sky, and that meant that it was 
morning and not afternoon, and 
by that he knew which way was 
west. 

He set off, striding down the 
hill, heading toward the one hope 
he had in all this strange new 
world. 

XXX 

WELL before dark, he picked 
a camping site, a grove 
through which ran a stream. 

He took off his shirt and tied 
it to a stick to form a crude 
seine, then went down to a small 
pool in the creek and after some 
experimenting found how to use 
the seine to the best advantage. 
At the end of an hour, he had 
five good-sized fish. 

He cleaned the fish with his 
pocket knife and lit the fire with 
a single match and congratulated 
himself upon his woodsmanship. 

He cooked one of the fish and 
ate it. It was not an easy thing 
to eat, for he had no salt and 
the cooking was very far from 
expert — part of the fish was 
charred by flame and the rest 



122 




 



was raw. But he was ravenous 
and it didn't taste too bad until 
the edge was off his hunger. After 
that it was a hard job choking 
down the rest, but he forced himself to do it, for he knew that he 
faced hard days ahead and to get 
through them he must keep his 
belly filled. 

By this time, darkness had fallen and he huddled beside the 
fire. He tried to think, but he was 
too tired for thinking. He caught 
himself dozing as he sat. 

He slept, awoke to find the 
fire almost out and the night 
still black, built up the fire while 
cold sweat broke out on him. The 
fire was for protection as well as 
warmth and cooking and on the 
day's march he had seen not only 
wolves, but bear as well, and 
once a large tawny shape moving 
too fast for him to make out 
what it was, except that it looked 
fiercely feline. 

He woke again and dawn was 
in the sky: He built up the fire 
and cooked the rest of the fish, 
ate one and part of another, 
tucked the others, messy as they 
were, into his pocket. He would 
need food throughout the day, 
and he did not want to waste the 
time or matches to make a fire. 

He hunted around the grove 
and found a stout, straight stick. 
It would serve him for a walking 
staff and might be of some use as 
a club if he were called upon to 



defend himself. He checked his 
pockets to see that he was leaving nothing behind. He had his 
pocket knife and the matches 
and they were the important 
things. He wrapped the matches 
carefully in his handkerchief, 
then put them in his undershirt. 
He needed those matches, for he 
doubted very seriously that he 
could make fire with flint or 
sticks. 

He was off before the Sun was 
up, slogging northwestward, but 
going more slowly than the day 
before, for now he realized that 
it was not speed but stamina that 
counted. To wear himself out in 
these first few days of hiking 
would be suicidal. 

TTE lost some time making a 
wide detour in the afternoon 
around a fair-sized herd of buffalo. He camped that night in 
another grove, having stopped an 
hour or so earlier beside a stream 
to catch another supply of fish 
with his shirt- and -staff seine. In 
the grove he found a few bushes 
of dewberries, with some fruit 
still on them, so he had dessert 
as well as fish. 

The Sun came up and he 
moved on again. 

And another day came up and 
he went on. And another and 
another. 

He caught fish. He picked berries. He found a deer that had 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



123 



been freshly killed, no doubt by 
some animal that his appearance had scared off. Hacking 
away with his pocket knife, he 
cut as many ragged hunks of 
venison as he could carry. Even 
without salt, the meat was a welcome change from fish. He even 
learned to eat a little of it raw, 
hacking off a mouthful and chewing it methodically as he walked 
along. He had to discard the last 
of the meat when it got so high 
that he couldn't live with it. 

He lost track of time. He had 
no idea of how many miles he 
had covered, nor how far he 
might be from the place where 
he was heading, nor even if he 
could find it at all. 

His shoes broke open and he 
stuffed them with dried grass and 
bound them together with strips 
cut off his trouser legs. 

One day he knelt to drink at 
a pool and in the glass- clear 
water saw a strange face staring 
back, at him. With a shock he 
realized that it was his own face, 
that of a bearded man, ragged 
and dirty and with the lines of 
fatigue upon him. 

The days came and went. He 
moved ahead, northwestward. He 
kept putting first one foot out 
and then the other. The Sun 
burned him at first and the burn 
turned to a tan. He crossed a 
wide, deep river on a log. It took 
a long time to get across and 



once the log almost spun and 
spilled him, but he made it. 

He walked through an empty 
land, with no sign of habitation, 
although it was a land that was 
well suited for human occupation. The soil was rich and the 
grass grew tall and thick, and 
the trees, which sprang skyward 
from groves along the watercourses, were straight and towered high into the sky. 

Then one day, just before sunset, he topped a rise and saw the 
land sweeping downward toward 
the distant ribbon of a river that 
he thought he recognized. 

It was not the river which held 
his attention, but the flash of setting Sun on a large area of metal 
far away. 

He put up his hand and shielded his eyes against the sunlight 
and tried to make out what it 
was, but it was too remote and it 
shone too brightly. 

Climbing down the slope, not 
knowing whether to be glad or 
frightened, Vickers kept a close 
watch on the gleam of far-off 
metal. At times he lost sight of 
it when he dipped into the swales, 
but it was always there when 
he topped the rise again, so he 
knew that it was real. 

Finally he was able to make 
out metallic buildings glinting in 
the Sun, and now he saw that 
strange shapes came and went in 
the air above them and that there 



124 




 



was a stir of life around them. 

But it was not a city or a 
town. For one thing, it was too 
metallic. And for another, there 
were no roads leading into it. 

AS he came nearer, he made 
out more and more of the 
detail of the place. When he was 
only a mile or two away, he 
stopped and looked at it and 
knew whav it was. 

It was not a city, but a factory, 
a giant, sprawling factory and to 
it came, continually, the strange 
flying things that probably were 
planes, but looked more like flying boxcars. Most of them came 
from the north and west and 
they came flying low, not too fast, 
to land in an area behind a 
screen of buildings that stood between him and the landing field. 

And the creatures that moved 
about among the buildings were 
not men — or did not seem to be 
men, but something else, metallic 
things that flashed in the last 
rays of the Sun. 

All about the buildings, standing on great towers, were cupshaped discs many feet across 
and all the faces of the discs 
were turned toward the Sun and 
the faces of the discs glowed as 
if there were fires inside them. 

He walked slowly toward the 
buildings and realized for the 
first time the sheer vastness of 
them. They covered acre after 



acre and they towered many stories high and the things that ran 
among them on their strange and 
many errands were not men, nor 
anything like men, but self-propeUecT machines. 

Some of the machines he could 
identify, but most of them he 
couldn't. He saw a carrying machine rush past with a load of 
lumber clutched within its belly 
and a great crane lumber by at 
thirty miles an hour with its steel 
jaws swinging. But there were 
others that looked like mechanistic nightmares and all of them 
went scurrying about in a terrific 
hurry. 

He found a street, or, if not 
a street, an open space between 
two buildings, and went along it, 
keeping close to the side of one, 
for it would have been inviting 
death to walk down the center, 
where the machines were racing 
around. 

He came to an opening in the 
building, from which a ramp led 
out to the street, and he cautiously climbed the ramp and looked 
inside. The interior was lighted, 
although he could not see where 
the light came from, and he 
looked down long avenues of machinery, busily at work. But there 
was no noise — that, he knew now, 
was what had bothered him. 
Here was a factory and it was 
utterly silent except for the sound 
of metal on the earth as the self


RING AROUND THE SUN 



125 



propelled machines flashed, along 
the street. 

He left the ramp and went 
down the street, hugging the 
building, and came out on the 
edge of the airfield where 
the aerial boxcars were landing 
and taking off. 

He watched the machines land 
and disgorge their freight, great 
piles of shining, newly sawed 
lumber, which were at once 
snatched up by the carrying machines and hustled off in all directions. Great gouts of raw ore, 
more than likely iron, were 
dumped into the maw of other 
carrying machines that looked, 
or so Vickers thought, like so 
many pelicans. 

Once the boxcar had unloaded 
it took off again — took off without a single sound, as if a wind 
had seized and wafted it into the 
upper air. 

The flying things came in endless streams, disgorging their endless round of cargo, which was 
taken care of almost immediately. Nothing was left piled up. By 
the time the machine had lifted 
into the air, the cargo it had carried had been rushed off somewhere. 

Their operation was not automatic, for to have been automatic, each operation must have 
been performed at a certain place 
and at a regular time, and each 
ship did not land in exactly the 



same place, nor was the time of 
their arrival spaced regularly. 
But each time a ship landed, the 
appropriate carrying machine 
would be on hand to take charge 
of the cargo. 

LIKE intelligent beings, Vickers 
thought, and even as he 
thought of it, he knew that 
that was exactly what they were 
— robots, each designed to take 
care of its own particular task. 
Not the manlike robots of one's 
imagination, but practical machines with intelligence and purpose. 

The Sun had set and as he 
stood at the corner of the building, he looked up at the towers 
which had faced it. The discs 
atop the towers were slowly turning back toward the east, so that 
when the Sun came up next 
morning, they would be facing it. 

Solar power, thought Vickers — 
where else had he heard of solar 
power? Why, in the mutant-produced houses, the dapper little 
salesman had explained to Ann 
and him how, when you had a 
solar plant, you could dispense 
with public utilities. 

And here again was solar 
power. Here, too, were frictionless machines that ran without 
the faintest noise, like the Forever car that would not wear 
out, but would last through many 
generations. 



126 




 



The machines paid no attention 
to him. It was as if they did not 
see him, did not suspect that he 
was there. Not one of them faltered as they rushed past him, 
not a single one had moved out 
of its way to give him a wider 
berth. Nor had any made a 
threatening motion toward him. 

With the going of the Sun, the 
area was lighted, but once again 
he could not determine the source 
of the light. The fall of night did 
not halt the work. The flying boxcars, great, angular, boxlike contraptions, still came flying in, 
unloaded and flew off again. The 
machines kept up their scurrying. The, long tines of machines 
within the buildings continued 
their soundless labor. 

The flying boxcars, he wondered, were they robots, too? 
And the answer seemed to be 
that they probably were. 

He edged his way onto the 
platform and looked at some of 
the crates closely, trying to determine what it was they held, 
but the only designations on 
them were stenciled code letters 
and numerals. He thought of 
prying some of them open, but 
he had no tools to do it, and he 
was just a bit afraid to do it, for 
while the machines continued to 
pay no attention to him, they 
might pay disastrous attention 
if he interfered. 

Hours later, he came out on 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



the other side of the sprawling 
factory area and walked away 
from it, then turned back and 
looked at it and saw it glowing 
with its strange light and sensed 
the bustle of it. 

He looked back at the factory 
and wondered what was made 
there and thought that he could 
guess. Probably razor blades and 
lighters and maybe light bulbs 
and perhaps the houses and the 
Forever cars. Maybe all of them. 

For this, he felt certain, was 
the factory — or at least one of 
the factories — that Crawford and 
North American Research had 
been looking for and had failed 
to find. 

No wonder, he thought, that 
they failed to find it.

"l^ICKERS came to the river 
» late in the afternoon, a river 
filled with tree -covered, grape vined islands, clogged with sandbars and filled with wicked gurgling and the hiss of shifting 
sands. He was sure it could be 
no other stream than the Wisconsin, flowing through its lower 
reaches to join the Mississippi. 
And if that were so, he knew 
where he was going. 

Now he feared that in this 
land there was no Preston house. 
Rather, he had fallen upon a 
strange land where there were no 

127 



men, only a complex robotic civilization in which Man played no 
part. There were no men connected with the factory, he was 
sure, for the place had been too 
self-sufficient to need the hand or 
the brain of Man. 

He camped on the river's 
shore, and sat for a long time 
before he went to sleep, staring 
out over the* silvered mirror of 
the moonlit water, feeling the 
loneliness strike into him, a 
deeper, more bitter loneliness 
than he'd ever known before. 

When morning came, he'd go 
on; he'd tread the trail to its 
dusty end. He'd find the place 
where the Preston house should 
stand and when he found that 
there was no house — what would 
he do then? 

He did not think about that. 
He did not want to think about 
it. He finally went to sleep. 

In the morning he went down 
the river and studied the bluffstudded southern shore and was 
more sure than ever that he knew 
where he was. 

He followed the river down 
and finally saw the misty blue of 
the great rock-faced bluff that 
rose at the junction of the rivers 
and the thin violet line of the 
cliffs beyond the greater river, 
so he climbed the nearest one 
and spied out the valley he had 
hunted. 

He camped that night in the 



valley and the next morning followed it and found the other 
branching valley that should lead 
to the Preston house. 

He was halfway up it before 
it became familiar, although he 
had seeen rock formations that 
seemed to bear some similarity 
to ones he had seen before. 

The suspicion and the hope 
grew in him, and at last the certainty, that, here once again 
was the enchanted valley he had 
traveled twenty years before! 

And now, he thought — now if 
the house is there. 

He felt faint and sick at the 
certainty that it would not be 
there, that he would reach the 
valley's head and see where it 
should have been, but wasn't. 
For if that happened, he was an 
exile from Earth. He wouldn't 
know how to get back. 

TTE found the path and fol■P lowed it and he saw the wind 
blow across the meadow grass so 
that it seemed as if the grass 
were water and the whiteness of 
its wind-blown stems were whitecaps rolling on it. He saw the 
clumps of crab-apple trees and 
they were not in bloom because 
the season was too late, but they 
were the same nevertheless. 

The path turned around the 
shoulder of a hill. Vickers stopped and looked at the house 
standing on the hill. He felt his 



128 




 



knees go wobbly beneath him 
and he looked away quickly, then 
brought his eyes back to make 
sure it was not imagination, that 
the house was really there. 
It really was. 

He started up the path and discovered that he was running and 
forced himself down to a rapid 
walk. And then he was running 
again and he didn't try to stop. 

He reached the hill that led 
up to the house and he went 
more slowly now, trying to regain his breath, and he thought 
what a sight he was, with weeks 
of beard upon his face, with his 
clothing ripped and torn and 
matted with the dirt and filth of 
travel, with his shoes falling to 
shreds, tied upon his feet with 
strips of cloth from his trouser 
legs, with his frayed trousers 
blowing in the wind, showing 
dirt-streaked knees. 

He came to the white picket 
fence and stopped beside the 
gate and leaned upon it, looking 
at the house. It was exactly as 
he had remembered it, neat, wellkept, with the lawn trimmed and 
flowers growing brightly, the 
woodwork newly painted and the 
brick a mellow color attesting to 
years of Sun upon it and the 
force of wind and rain. 

"Kathleen," he said, and he 
couldn't say the name too well, 
for his lips were parched and 
rough. "I've come back again." 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



He wondered what she'd look 
like, after all these years. He 
must not, he warned himself, expect to see the girl he once had 
known, the girl of seventeen or 
eighteen, but a woman near his 
own age. 

She would see him standing at 
the gate and even with the beard 
and the tattered clothes and the 
weeks of travel on him, she would 
know him and would open the 
door and come down the walk to 
greet him. 

The door opened and the Sun 
was in his eyes so that he could 
not see her until she'd stepped 
out on the porch, 

"Kathleen," he said. 

But it wasn't Kathleen. 

It was someone he'd never seen 
before — a man who had on almost 
no clothes at all and who glittered as he walked down the path 
and who said to Vickers, "Sir, 
what can I do for you?" 

XXXII 

nplHERE was something about 
the glitter of the man, something about the way he walked 
and the way he talked that didn't 
feel right. He had no hair, for 
one thing, either on his head or 
on his chest. His eyes were funny, too. They glittered like the 
rest of him and he seemed to 
have no lips. 

"I'm a robot, sir," he explained, 

129 



seeing Vickers' puzzlement. 

"Oh," said Vickers. 
' "My name is Hezekiah." 

"How are you, Hezekiah ?" 
Vickers asked inanely, not knowing what else to say. 

"I'm all right," replied Hezekiah. "I am always all right. 
There is nothing to go wrong 
with me. But thank you for asking, sir." 

"I had hoped to find someone 
here." said Vickers. "A Miss 
Kathleen Preston. Does she happen to be home?" 

He watched the robot's eyes 
and there was no answer in them. 

The robot asked, "Won't you 
come in, sir^ and wait?" 

"Why, certainly," said Vickers. 

The robot held the gate open 
for him and he came through, 
walking on the path of mellowed 
brick, and he noticed how tidy 
the house was, The windows 
sparkled with the cleanliness of 
a recent washing and the shutters 
hung true and straight and the 
trim was painted and the lawn 
looked as if it had not been only 
mowed, but razored. Gay beds of 
flowers bloomed without a single 
weed and the picket fence marched its eternal guard around the 
house straight as wooden soldiers 
and painted gleaming white. 

The robot went up the steps 
to the little porch that opened 
on the side entrance and pushed 
the door open for Vickers. 



"To your right, sir," Hezekiah 
said. "Take a chair and wait. 
If there is anything you wish, 
there is a bell upon the table." 

"Thank you, Hezekiah," said 
Vickers. 

The room was large. It was 
gaily papered and had a small 
marble fireplace with a mirror 
over the mantle and there was a 
sort of official hush, as if the 
place might be an antechamber 
for important conferences. 

Vickers took a chair and 
waited. 

What had he expected? Kathleen bursting from the house and 
running down the steps to meet 
him, happy after twenty years 
of never hearing from him? He 
shook his head. It didn't work 
that way. It wasn't logical that 
it should. 

But there were other things 
that were not logical, either, and 
they had worked out. It had not 
been logical that he should find 
this house in this other world, 
and still he had found it and now 
sat beneath its roof and waited. 
It had not been logical that he 
should find the top he had not 
remembered and, finding it, know 
what to use it for. But he had 
found it and he had used it and 
was here. 

HE sat quietly, listening to 
the house. 
There was a murmur of voices 



130 




 



in the room that opened off the 
waiting room and he saw that 
the door which led into it was 
open an inch or two. 

There was no other sound. 
The house lay in morning quiet. 

He got up from his chair and 
paced to the window and from 
the window back to the marble 
fireplace. 

Who was in that other room? 
Why was he waiting? Whom 
would he see when he walked 
through that door and what 
would they say to him? 

He stopped beside the door, 
standing with his back against 
the wall, holding his breath to 
listen. 

T^HE murmur of voices became 
words. 

". . . going to be a shock." 

A deep, gruff voice said, "It 
always is a shock. There's nothing you can do to take the shock 
away. No matter how you look 
at it, it always is degrading." 

A slow, drawling voice said, 
"It's unfortunate that we have 
to work it the way we do. It's 
too bad we can't let them go on 
in their rightful bodies." 

Businesslike; clipped, precise, 
the first voice said, "Most of 
the androids take it fairly well. 
Even knowing what it means, 
they take it fairly well. We make 
them understand. And, of course, 
out of the three, there's always 



the lucky one, the one that can 
go on in his actual body." 

"I have a feeling," said the 
gruff voice, "that we started in 
on Vickers just a bit too soon." 

"Flanders said we had to. He 
thinks Vickers is the only one 
who can handle Crawford." 

And Flanders' voice saying, "I 
am sure he can. He was a late 
starter, but he was coming fast. 
We gave it to him hard. First 
the bug got careless and he 
caught it and that set him to 
thinking. Then, after that, we 
arranged the lynching threat. 
Then he found the top we planted 
and the association clicked. Give 
him just another jolt or two . . ." 

"How about the girl, Flanders? 
That — what's her name?" 

"Ann Carter," Flanders said. 
"We've been jolting her a bit, but 
not as hard as Vickers." 

"How will they take it?" asked 
the drawling voice, "when they 
find they're android?" 

Vickers lurched away from the . 
door, groping with his hands, as 
if he were walking in the dark 
through a room filled with furniture. 

Used, he thought. 

Not even human. 

"Da^mn you, Flanders !" he 
said. "Damn you for a smirking 
heel!" 

Not only he, but Ann — they 
were both androids. 

He had to get away, he told 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



131 



himself. He had to find a place 
where he could hide and let his 
mind calm down and plan what 
he meant to do. 

For he was going to do something. It wasn't going to stay this 
way. He'd deal himself a hand 
and cut in on the game. 

He moved along the hall and 
reached the door and opened it 
a crack to see if anyone was there. 
The lawn was empty. There was 
no one in sight. 

He went out the door and 
closed it gently behind him and 
when he hit the ground, jumping 
from the tiny porch, he was running. He went over the fence. 

He didn't look back until he 
reached the trees. When he did, 
the house stood serenely, majestically, on its hilltop at the valley's head. 

XXXIII 

SO he was an android, an artificial man, a body made out 
of a handful of chemicals and 
the cunning of Man's mind and 
the wizardry of Man's technique 
— but ordinary, normal men had 
no such cunning and no such 
technique. The mutants did. 
They could make an artificial 
man and make him so well and 
cleverly that even he, himself, 
would never know for sure. And 
artificial women, too — like Ann 
Carter. 



The mutants could make androids and robots and Forever 
cars and everlasting . razor blades 
and a host of other gadgets, all 
designed to wreck the race from 
which they sprang. They had 
synthesized the carbohydrate as 
food and the protein to make the 
bodies of their androids, and 
they knew how to travel from 
one earth to another — all those 
earths that ringed the Sun. This 
much he knew they could do and 
were doing. What other things 
they might be doing, he had no 
idea. Nor any idea, either, of the 
things they dreamed or planned. 

"You're a mutant," Crawford 
had told him. "You're one^ of 
them." For Crawford had a machine that could pry into the 
mind and tell its owner what 
was in that mind, but the machine was stupid in the last analysis, for it couldn't even tell a 
real man from a fake. 

No mutant, but a mutant's errand boy. Not even a man, only 
an artificial copy. 

How many others, he wondered, could there be like him? 
How many of his kind were 
trailed and watched by Crawford's men, unaware that they did 
not trail and watch the mutant, 
but a thing of mutant manufacture? That, thought Vickers, was 
the true measure of the difference 
between the normal man and mutant — the normal man could mis


132 




 



take the mutant's scarecrow for 
the mutant. 

The mutants made a man and 
turned him loose and watched 
him and allowed him to develop 
and set a spying mechanism that 
they called a bug to watch him, 
a little mechanical mouse that 
could be smashed with a paperweight. 

And in the proper time they 
jolted him — jolted him for what? 
They stirred up his fellow townsmen so he fled a lynching party; 
they planned for him to find a 
toy out of childhood and waited 
to see if the toy might not trip 
a childhood association ; they 
fixed it so he would drive a Forever car when they knew that 
driving such a car could cause 
him to be mobbed. 

And after they had jolted an 
android, what happened to him 
then? 

What became of the androids 
once they had been used for the 
purpose of their making? 

He had told Crawford that 
when he knew what was going 
on, he'd talk to him again. And 
now he knew something of what 
was going on and Crawford 
might be very interested. 

He walked on through the 
woods, with its massive trees and 
its deep-laid forest mold and 
thick matting of old leaves, with 
its mosses and its flowers and its 
strange silence filled with uncar


ing and with comfort. 

He had to find Ann Carter. He 
had to tell her. Together, the 
two of them would somehow 
stand against it. 

He halted beside the great oak 
tree and stared up at its leaves 
and tried to clear his mind, to 
wipe it clean of the chaos of his 
thinking so he could start fresh 
again. 

There were two things that 
stood out above all others: 

He had to get back to the parent Earth. 

He had to find Ann Carter. 

XXXIV 

TTE did not see the man until 
the voice startled him into 
turning. 

"Good morning, stranger," said 
the man, standing just a few 
feet away, a great, tall, strong 
man dressed much as a farm 
hand or a factory worker, but 
with a jaunty, peaked cap and 
a brilliant feather stuck into it. 

Despite the rudeness of his 
clothing, there was nothing of 
the peasant about the man, but 
a cheerful self-sufficiency that 
reminded Vickers of someone he'd 
read about and he tried to think 
who it might be, and he thought 
of Robin Hood. 

Across the man's shoulder was 
a strap that held a quiver full 
of arrows and in his hand he held 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



133 



a bow. Two young rabbits hung 
lifeless from his belt and the 
blood dripping from them had 
smeared his trouser leg. 

"Good morning," said Vickers, 
shortly. 

He didn't like the idea of this 
man popping up from nowhere. 

"You're another one of them," 
the man said. 

"Another one of what?" 



The man laughed. "We get one 
of you every once in a while. 
Someone who has blundered 
through and doesn't know where 
he is. I've often wondered what 
happened to them before we 
were settled here or what happens 
to them when they pop through 
a long way from any settlement." 

"I don't know what you're 
talking about." 




134 




 



"Another thing you don't 
know," said the man, "is where 
you are." 

"I have a theory," Vickers retorted. "This is a second earth." 

"You got it pegged pretty 
close. You're better than most of 
them. They just flounder around 
and gasp and won't believe it 
when we tell them this is earth 
number two." 




"That's neat," said Vickers. 
"Earth Number Two, is it? And 
what about Number Three?" 

"It's there, waiting until we 
need it. Worlds without end, waiting until we need them. We can 
go on pioneering for generation 
after generation. A new earth for 
each new generation if we have 
to, but they say we won't be 
needing them that fast." 

"They?" challenged Vickers. 
"Who are they?" 

"The mutants," said the man. 
"The local ones live in the Big 
House. You didn't see the Big 
House?" 




ICKERS shook his head 
warily. 



"You must have missed it, 
coming up the ridge. A big brick 
place with a white picket fence 
around it and other buildings 
that look like barns, only they 
aren't barns." 

"Aren't they?" 

"No," said the man. "They 
are laboratories and experimental 
buildings and there is one building that is fixed up for listening." 

"Why do they have a place for 
listening? Seems to me you could 
listen almost anywhere. You and 
I can listen without having a 
special place fixed up for us." 

"They listen to the stars," the 
man told him. 

"They listen . . ." began Vickers, and then remembered Flan

ders sitting on the porch in 
Cliff wood, rocking in the chair 
and saying that great pools and 
reservoirs of knowledge existed 
in the stars, that it ' was there 
for the taking and you might not 
need rockets to go there and get 
it, but might reach out with your 
mind and that you'd have to sift 
and winnow, but you'd find much 
that you could use. 

"Telepathy?" asked Vickers. 
"That's it," said the man. 
"They don't listen to the stars 
really, but to people who live on 
the planets of the stars. Now 
ain't that the screwiest thing you 
ever heard of — listening to the 
stars!" 

"Yes, I guess it is." 
"But they get ideas from these 
people. They don't talk to them, 
I guess, just listen in on them. 
They catch some of the things 
they're thinking and some of the 
things they know and a lot of it 
can be used and a lot of it don't 
make no sense at all. But it's the 
truth, so help me. mister." 

"My name is Vickers. Jay 
Vickers." 

"Well, I'm glad to know you, 
Mr. Vickers. My name is Asa 
Andrews." 

He held out his hand and 
Vickers took it and his grip was 
hard and sure. 

And now. he knew that this was 
no Robin Hood. Here before him 
stood an American pioneer, the' 



man who carried the long rifle 
from the colonies to the hunting 
grounds of Kentucky. Here were 
the alert stance, the independence, the quick good will and 
wit, the steady self-reliance. 
Here, once again, in the forests 
of Earth No. 2, was another pioneer type, sturdy and independent and a good man for a friend. 

"These mutants must be the 
people who are putting out the 
everlasting razor and all that 
other stuff in the gadget shops," 
said Vickers. 

"You catch on quick," said 
Andrews. "We'll go up to the 
Big House in a day or two and 
you can talk to them." 

HE shifted the bow from one 
hand to another. "Look, 
Vickers, did you leave someone 
back there? A wife and some kids, 
maybe?" 

"No one," said Vickers. "Not 
a single soul:" 

"If you had, we'd have gone up 
to the Big House right away and 
told them about it and they 
would have fixed it up to bring 
the wife and kids through, too. 
That's the only thing about this 
place — once you get here, there's 
no going back. Although why 
anyone would want to go back 
is more than I can figure out. 
So far as I know, no one has 
wanted to." 
He looked Vickers up and 



136 




 



down, laughter tugging at his 
mouth. 

"You look all gaunted down," 
he said. "You ain't been eating 
good." 

"Just fish and some venison I 
found. And berries." 

"The old lady will have the 
victuals on. We'll get some food 
into you and those whiskers off 
and I'll have the kids heat up 
some water and you can take a 
bath, and then we can sit and 
talk. We got a lot to talk about." 

He led the way, with Vickers 
following, down the ridge through 
the heavy timber. 

They came out on the edge of 
a cleared field green with growing 
corn. 

"That's my place down there," 
said Andrews. "Down at the hollow's head. You can see the 
smoke." 

"Nice field of corn you have," 
Vickers said. 

"Knee-high by the Fourth. 
And over there is Jake Smith's 
place. You can see the house if 
you look a little close. And just 
beyond the hogsback are John 
Simmon's fields. There are other 
neighbors, but you can't see from 
here." 

They climbed the barbed wire 
fence and went across the field, 
walking between the corn rows. 

"It's different here," said Andrews, "than back on Earth. I 
was working in a factory there 



and living in a place that you 
wouldn't keep animals in. Then 
the factory shut down and there 
was no money. I went to the carbohydrates people and they kept 
the family fed. Then the landlord threw us out. The carbohydrates people had been so friendly that I went to them and told 
them what had happened. They 
were the only ones I knew of 
that I could turn to. After a day 
or two, one of them came around 
and told us about this place — 
except, of course, he didn't tell 
us what it really was. He said 
it was a brand-new territory 
that was opening up and there 
was free land for the taking and 
help to get you on your feet and 
that I could make a living 
and have a house instead of a 
two-by-four apartment in a stinking tenement and I said that we 
would go. He warned me that if 
we went, we couldn't come back 
again and I asked him who would 
want to?" 

"You've never regretted it?" 
asked Vickers. 

"It was the luckiest thing that 
ever happened to us. Fresh air 
for the kids and all you want 
to eat and a place to live with 
no landlord to throw you out. 
No dues to pay and no taxes to 
scrape up. Just like in the history books." 

"The history books?" 

"When America was opened 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



137 



up and the pioneers piled in. 
Land for the taking. More land 
than anyone can use, so rich you 
just scratch the ground a little 
and throw in some seed and you 
got a crop. Land to plant things 
in and wood to burn and build 
with and you can walk out at 
night and the sky is full of stars 
and the air is so clean it seems 
to hurt your nose when you draw 
it in." * 




N DREWS turned and looked 
at Vickers, his eyes hard. 



"It was the best thing that 
ever happened to me," he said, as 
if daring Vickers to contradict 
him. 

"But these mutants," said 
Vickers. "Don't they get into your 
hair? Don't they lord it over 
you?" 

"They don't do anything but 
help us. They send us a robot to 
help out with the work when we 
need to have some help and they 
send a robot that lives with us 
nine months of the year to teach 
the kids. One robot teacher for 
each family. Now ain't that something? Your own private teacher, 
just like you went out and hired 
yourself a high-toned private tu. tor like the rich folks back on 
Earth." 

"And you don't resent these 
mutants? You don't hate fhem 
because they know more than 
you do?" 



"Mister," said Asa Andrews, 
"you don't want to let anyone 
around these parts hear you talking like that, When we first came, 
they explained it all to us. They 
had indoct — indoctrin — " 

"Indoctrination courses." 

"That's it. They told us what 
the score was. They explained 
the rules. There aren't many." 

"Like not having any firearms," said Vickers. 

"That's one of them. How did 
you know that?" 

"You're hunting with a bow." 

"Another one is that if you get 
into a row with anybody and 
can't settle it peaceable, the' two 
of you go up to the Big House 
and let them settle it And if you 
get sick, you're to let them know 
right away so they can send you 
a doctor and whatever else you 
need. The rules work to your 
benefit." 

"How about work?" 

"Work?" 

"You have to earn some 
money, don't you?" 

"Not yet," said Andrews. "The 
mutants give us everything we 
want or need. All we do is grow 
the food. This is what they call — 
what was that word? — this is 
what they call the pastoral-feudal stage. You ever hear a word 
like that?" 

"But they must have factories," Vickers persisted, ignoring 
the question. "Places where they 



138 




 



make the razor hlades and stuff. 
They'd need men to work in 
them." 

"They use robots, just lately 
they started making a car that 
can last forever. The plant is 
just a distanee from here. But 
they use robots to do the entire 
job. You know what a robot is." 

"Yes, I know," said Vickers. 

They climbed the fence that 
edged the corn field and walked 
across a pasture toward the 
house. 

Someone yelled a joyous greeting and a half a dozen kids came 
running down the hill, followed 
by yelping dogs. A woman came 
to the door of the house, built of 
peeled logs. She waved to them 
and Andrews waved back and 
then the kids and dogs descended 
on them in a yelping, howling, 
happy pack. 

XXXV 

VICKERS lay "in bed, in the 
loft above the kitchen, and 
listened to the wind pattering on 
bare feet across the shingles just 
above his head. He turned and 
burrowed his head into the goosedown pillow and beneath him the 
corn -shuck mattress rustled in 
the dark. 

He was clean, washed clean in 
the tub behind the house", with 
water heated in a kettle on an 
outdoor fire, lathering himself 



with soap while Andrews sat on a 
nearby stump and talked and 
the children played in the yard 
and the dogs lay sleeping in the 
Sun, twitching their hides to 
chase away the flies. 

He had eaten, two full meals 
of food such as he had forgotten 
could exist after days of halfcooked fish and half-rotten venison— cornbread and sorghum and 
young rabbits fried in a smoking 
skillet, with creamed new potatoes and greens the children had 
gone out and gathered and a 
salad of watercress pulled from 
the spring below the house and 
for supper fresh eggs just taken 
from the nest. 

He had shaved, with the children ringed around him watching, after Andrews had seated 
him on a stump and had used the 
scissors to trim away the beard. 

And after that he and Andrews 
had sat on the steps and talked. 
Andrews had said that he knew 
of a place that was crying for a 
house — a tucked-in place just 
across the hill, with a spring a 
step or two away and some level 
ground on a bench above the 
creek where a man could lay out 
his fields. There was wood in 
plenty for the house, great, tall 
trees, and Andrews said that he 
would help him cut them. When 
the logs were ready, the neighbors would come in for the raising and Jake would bring along 



RING A ROUND THE SUN 



139 



some of the corn that he'd been 
cooking and Ben would bring his 
fiddle and they'd have themselves 
a hoedown when the house was 
up. If they needed help beyond 
what the neighbors could supply, 
all they'd have to do was send 
word up to the Big House and 
the mutants would send a gang 
of robots. But that probably 
wouldn't be necessary, Andrews 
had said. The neighbors were a 
willing lot and always ready to 
help; glad, too, to see another 
family moving in. 

Once the house was built, said 
Andrews, Simmons had some 
daughters that Vickers might 
want to have a look at, although 
you could do your picking blind 
if you wanted to, for they were a 
likely lot. Andrews had dug Vickers in the ribs with his elbow 
and had laughed uproariously 
and Jean, Andrews' wife, who 
had come out to sit with them a 
while, had smiled shyly at him 
and then had turned to watch 
the children playing in the yard. 

After supper, Andrews had 
showed him with some pride the 
books on the shelf in the living 
room and had said that he was 
reading them, something he had 
never done before — something he 
had never wanted to do before, 
nor had the time to do. Vickers, 
looking at the books, had found 
Homer and Shakespeare, Montaigne and Austen, Thoreau and 



Steinbeck. 

"You mean you're reading 
these?" he asked. 

Andrews had nodded. "Reading them and liking them, mostly. 
Once in a while I find it a little 
hard to wade through them, but 
I keep at it. Jean likes Austen 
best." 

It was a good life here, said 
Andrews, the best life they'd ever 
known and Jean smiled her 
agreement and the kids had lost 
an argument about letting the 
dogs come in and sleep the night 
with them. 

HERE again was the American 
frontier, but idealized and 
bookish, with all the frontier's 
advantages and none of its terror 
and its hardship. Here was a 
paternal feudalism, the Big 
House on the hill serving as the 
castle that looked down across 
the fields where happy people 
took their living from the soil. 
Here was a time.for resting and 
for gathering strength. And here 
was peace. No talk of war, no 
taxes to fight a war, or to prevent a war by a proved willingness to fight. 

Here was — what had Andrews 
said? — the pastoral-feudal stage. 
And after that came what stage? 
The pastoral -feudal stage for 
resting and thinking, for getting 
thoughts in order, for establishing once again the bond between 



140 




 



Man and soil, the stage in which 
was prepared the way for the 
development of a culture that 
would be better than the one they 
had left. 

This was one earth of many 
earths. How many others? Hundreds, thousands, millions? Earth 
following earth, and now all the 
earths lay open. 

He tried to figure it out and 
he thought he saw the pattern 
that the mutants planned. It was 
simple and it was brutal, but it 
was workable. 

There was an Earth that was 
a failure. Somewhere, on the path 
that led up from apedom, they 
had taken the wrong turning and 
had traveled since that day a 
long road of misery. There was 
brilliance in these people, and 
goodness, and ability — but they 
had poured their brilliance and 
their ability into channels of hate 
and arrogance and their goodness 
had been buried in selfishness. 

They were worth the saving, 
as a drunkard or a criminal is 
worthy of rehabilitation. But to 
save them, you must get them 
« out of the neighborhood they 
live in, out of the slums of human 
thought and method. 

To do this, you must break 
the world they live in and you 
must have a plan to break it and 
after it is broken, you must have 
a program that leads to a better 
world. 



But first of all, there must be 
a plan of action. 

FIRST you shattered the economic systems on which old 
Earth was built. You shattered 
it with Forever cars and everlasting razor blades and with synthetic carbohydrates that would 
feed the hungry. You destroyed 
industry by- producing things 
that industry could not duplicate and when you shattered industry, war was impossible and 
half the job was done. 

But then you left people without jobs, so you fed them with 
carbohydrates while you tried to 
ferry them to the following earths 
that lay waiting for them. If 
there wasn't room enough on 
Earth No. 2, you sent some of 
them to No. 3 and maybe No. 4, 
so that you had no crowding, so 
there was room enough for all. 
On the new earths there was a 
beginning again, a chance to 
dodge the errors and skirt the 
dangers that had bathed Old 
Earth in blood for countless centuries. 

On these new earths you could 
build any sort of culture that 
you wished. You could even 
experiment, aim at one culture 
on Earth No. 2 and a slightly 
different one on No. 3 and yet a 
different one on No. 4. And after 
a thousand years or so, you could 
compare these cultures and see 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



141 



which one was best and consult 
the bales of data you had kept 
and pinpoint each mistake in 
each particular culture. In time 
you could arrive at a formula for 
the best in human cultures. 

Here on this earth, the pastoral-feudal culture was only the 
first step. It was a resting place 
for education and for settling 
down. Things would change or 
be changed. The son of the man 
in whose house he lay would 
build a better house and probably would have robots to work 
his fields, while he himself would 
live a leisured life. Out of a leisured people, with their energies 
channeled by good leadership, 
would come paradise on Earth — 
or on many earths. 

There had been that article in 
the paper he had read on that 
morning — was it only days ago? 
— which had said that the authorities were alarmed at mass 
disappearances. While families 
were dropping out of sight for 
no apparent reason and with 
nothing in common except abject poverty. And, of course, it 
would be the very poor who 
would be taken first — the homeless and the jobless and the sick 
— to be settled on these earths 
that followed in the track of the 
dark and bloody world inhabited 
by Man. 

Soon there would be little more 
than a handful of people on the 



dark and bloody Earth. Soon, 
in a thousand years or less, it 
would go tumbling on its way 
alone, its hide cleansed of the 
ravening tribe which had eaten at 
it and mangled it and ravished it. 
This same tribe would be established on other earths, under better guidance, to create for themselves a better life. 

Beautiful — and yet there was 
this matter of the androids. 

BEGIN at the beginning, he 
told himself. Start with first 
facts, try to see the logic of it, 
to figure out the course of mutation. 

There " always had been mutants. If^there had not been, Man 
would still be a little skittering 
creature hiding in the jungle. 

There had been the mutation 
of the opposable thumb. There 
had been mutations within the 
little brain that made for creature cunning. Some mutation, 
unrecorded, had captured fire 
and tamed it. Another mutation 
had evolved the wheel. Still another had invented the bow and 
arrow. And so it went, on down* 
the ages, mutation on mutation, 
building the ladder that mankind climbed. 

Except that the creature who 
had captured and tamed the 
name did not know he was e 
mutant. And neither had the 
tribesman who had thought up 




 



the wheel, nor the bow and arrow experimenter. 

Down through the ages there 
had been unsuspected and unsuspecting mutants — men who 
were successful beyond the success of others, great business 
figures or great statesmen, great 
writers, great scientists and artists, men who stood so far above 
the herd of their fellow men that 
they had seemed like giants in 
comparison. 

Perhaps not all of them were 
mutants, but some of them would 
have been. But their mutancy 
would have been a crippled thing 
in comparison with what it could 
have been, for they were forced 
to conform to the social and 
economic pattern set by a nonmutant society. That they had 
been able to conform, to fit themselves to a smaller measure than 
their normal stature, that they 
had been able to get along with 
men who were less than they and 
still stand out as men of towering ability was in itself a 
measure of their mutancy. 

Although their success had been 
large in the terms of normal 
men, their mutancy had been a 
failure in that it never reached 
its full realization and this was 
because these men had never 
known that they were mutants. 
They had been just a little 
smarter or a little handier or 
somewhat quicker than the com


mon run of mankind. 

But suppose that a man should 
know from a piece of indisputable evidence that he was a mutant what would happen then? 

Suppose, for example, a man 
should find that he could reach 
out to the stars and that he 
could catch the thoughts and 
plans of the thinking creatures 
who lived on planets circling 
those far suns — that would be 
full and sufficient proof that he 
was a mutant. And if he could 
obtain from his seeking in the 
stars some specific information 
of certain economic value — say, 
the principle of a frictionless machine — then without question he 
would know that he had a mutant gift. Once knowing that he 
was a mutant, he would not be 
able to fit so snugly, nor so 
smugly, into his contemporary 
niche as those men who had been 
mutants, but had never known 
they were. Knowing that he was 
a mutant, he would have the 
itch of greatness, would know 
the necessity of following his 
own path and not the beaten 
path. 

HE might be slightly terrified 
by the things he learned winnowing the stars and he might 
be terribly lonesome and he 
might see the necessity of other 
humans than he alone working 
on the information that he was 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



143 



dredging from the depths of 
space. 

So he would seek for other 
mutants and he would do it 
cleverly and it might take him 
a long time before he found one 
of them and he would have to 
approach the other mutant cautiously and win his confidence 
and finally tell him what he had 
in mind. Then there'd be two 
mutants, banded together, and 
they would seek other mutants. 
Not all of them would be able 
to send their minds out to the 
stars, but they would be able to 
do other things. Some of them 
would understand electronics, almost as if by instinct, more completely than any normal man, 
even with years of intensive 
training, and another might sense 
the strange alignment of time and 
space that allowed for other 
worlds than one, circling the Sun 
like a cosmic ring of planets. 

Some of the mutants would be 
women and to the mutants found 
would be added mutants born, 
and eventually there would be a 
mutant organization of several 
hundred persons, pooling their 
talents. 

From the information they 
gathered from the stars, plus the 
mutant abilities of certain others 
of them, they would invent and 
market certain gadgets that would 
bring in the necessary money for 
them to continue with their work. 



How many of the now common, 
workaday, almost prosaic gadgets used in the world today, 
Vickers wondered, were the products of this mutant race? 

But the time would come when 
the mutant organization and the 
work they did would become too 
challenging to pass unnoticed 
and the mutants would seek a 
place to hide — a safe place where 
they could continue the work 
that they were doing. And what 
safer place could there be than 
one of those other earths? 

VICKERS lay on the cornshuck mattress and stared 
into the darkness and wondered 
at the glibness of his imagination, 
with the nagging feeling that it 
was not imagination — that it was 
something that he knew. But 
how could he know it? 

Conditioning, perhaps, of his 
android mind. Or an actual 
knowledge gained in some period 
of his life that had been blotted 
out, as the time he had gone into 
fairyland at the age of eight had 
been — a knowledge that now was 
coming back again, as the remembrance of the visit to fairyland had finally returned. 

Or ancestral memory, perhaps, 
actual specific memory passed to 
child from parent as instinct was 
passed — but the catch was that, 
as an android, he didn't have a 
parent. 



144 




 



He was parentless and raceless 
and a mockery of a man, created 
for a purpose he did not even 
know. 

What purpose could the mutants have for him? What talent 
did he possess that made him 
useful to them? 

That was the thing that hurt — 
that he should be used for some 
purpose which he did not know, 
that Ann should have some purpose she did not even guess. 

The work of the mutants was 
more important than mere gadgetry, something greater than 
Forever cars and everlasting razor 
blades and synthetic carbohydrates. Their work was the rescue 
and the re-establishment of the 
race^-the starting over again of 
a badly muddled humanity. It 
was the development of a world 
or worlds where war would not 
be merely outlawed, but impossible, where fear would never 
raise its head, where progress 
would have a different value than 
it had in mankind's world today. 

And into a program of this 
sort, where did Jay Vickers fit? 

The mutants would take from 
the human race the deadly playthings and keep those playthings 
in trust until the child of Man 
was old enough to use them without hurting himself or injuring 
his neighbor. They would take 
from the three - year - old the 
twelve-year-old toy he was using 



dangerously and when he was 
twelve years old would give it 
back again, probably with refinements. 

And the culture of the future, 
under mutant guidance, would 
be not merely a mechanistic culture, but a social and an economic 
and an artistic and spiritual culture as well. The mutants would 
take lopsided Man and mold him 
into balance and the years that 
were lost in the remolding would 
pay interest in humanity in the 
years to come. 

But that was speculation; that 
was getting nothing done. The 
thing that counted now was what 
he. Jay Vickers, android, meant 
to do about it. What was the 
role that he was to play? 

Before he did anything about 
it, he needed information and he 
couldn't get it here, lying on a 
corn-shuck mattress in the loft 
above the kitchen of a neopioneer home. 

There was only one place 
where he could get that information. 

He slid noiselessly out of bed 
and fumbled in the dark to find 
his ragged clothes. 

XXXVI 

TPHE house was dark, sleeping 
in the moonlight, with the 
tall shadows of the trees cast 
against its front. He stood in the 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



145 



shadow just outside the front gate 
and looked at it, remembering 
how he had seen it in the moonlight once before, when a road 
ran past the gate, but now there 
was no road. He recalled how 
the glow had fallen on the whiteness of the pillars and had turned them to ghostly beauty and 
of the words the two of them had 
said as they stood and watched 
the moonlight shattered on the 
pillars. 

But that was dead and done. 
All that was left was the bitterness of knowing that he was not 
a man, but the imitation of a 
man. 

TIE opened the gate, went up 
the walk and climbed the 
steps that led to the porch. He 
crossed the porch and his footsteps rang so loudly in the stillness that he felt certain those in 
the house would hear him. 

He found the bell and put his 
thumb upon it and pressed, then 
stood waiting, as he had waited 
once before. But this time there 
would be no Kathleen to come 
to the door to greet him. 

He waited and a light sprang 
into life in the central hall and 
through the glass he saw a manlike figure fumbling at the door. 
The door came open and he 
stepped inside and the gleaming 
robot bowed a little stiffly and 
said, "Good evening, sir." 



"Hezekiah, 1 presume," said 
Vickers. 

"Hezekiah, sir," the robot confirmed. "You met me this morning." 

"I went for a walk." 

"And now perhaps I could 
show you to your room." 

The robot turned and went up 
the winding staircase, with Vickers following him. 

"It's a nice night, sir," the 
robot said. 

"Very nice." 

"You have eaten, sir?" 

"Yes, thank you." 

"I could bring you up a snack," 
Hezekiah offered. "I believe there 
is some chicken left." 

"No," said Vickers. "Thank 
you just the same." 

Hezekiah shoved open a door 
and turned on a light, then stepped aside making room for Vickers to go in. 

"Perhaps," said Hezekiah, "you 
would like a nightcap." 

"That's e good idea. Scotch, 
if you have it handy." 

"In just a moment, sir. You 
will find some pajamas in the 
third drawer from the top. They 
may be a little large, but probably you can manage." 

He found the pajamas and 
they were fairly new and very 
loud and they seemed quite a bit 
too big, but they were better 
than nothing and Vickers laid 
them out. 



146 




 



fT^HE room was pleasant, with 
a huge bed covered by a white, 
stitched counterpane and the 
white curtains at the windows 
blew in on the* night breeze. 

He sat down in a chair to wait 
for Hezekiah and the drink and 
for the first time in many days 
he knew how tired he was. He'd 
have the drink and climb into 
bed and when morning came he'd 
go stomping down the stairs, 
looking for a showdown. 

The door opened and he turned to take the drink from Hezekiah. 

It wasn't Hezekiah; it was 
Horton Flanders, in a crimson 
dressing robe fastened tight about 
his neck, and slippers on his feet 
that slapped against the floor as 
he crossed the room. 

He sat down in another chair 
and looked at Vickers, with a 
half smile on his face. 

"So you came back," he said. 

"I came back to listen," Vickers told him. "You can start 
talking right away." 

"That's why I got up. As soon 
as Hezekiah told me you had 
arrived, I knew you'd want to 
talk." 

"I don't want to talk," said 
Vickers. "I want to listen." 

"Yes, certainly. I am the one 
to do the talking." 

"And not about the reservoirs 
of knowledge, of which you sermonize most beautifully, but 



specific practical, rather mundane things." 
"Like what?" 

"Like why I am an android 
and why Ann Carter is, also. 
And whether there ever was a 
person named Kathleen Preston 
or is that just a story that was 
conditioned in my mind? And if 
there actually t was a Kathleen 
Preston, where is she now? And, 
finally, where do I fit in and 
now that I'm here what do you 
intend to do?" 

INLANDERS nodded his head. 

"A very admirable set of 
questions. You would pick the 
ones I can't answer." 

"I came to tell you that the 
mutants are being hunted down 
and killed on that other world, 
that the gadget shops are being 
wrecked and burned, that the 
normal humans are finally fighting back. I came to warn you 
because I thought I was a mutant, too . . ." 

"You are a mutant. I can as-, 
sure you, Vickers, you're a very 
special kind of mutant." 

"A mutant android." 

"You are difficult," said Flanders. "You let your bitterness — " 

"Of course I'm bitter," Vickers 
cut in. "Who wouldn't be? All 
my life I believed I was a man 
and now I find I'm not." 

"You fool! You don't know 
what you are!" 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



XTEZEKIAH rapped on the 
door and came in with a 
tray. He set it on a table and 
Vickers saw that there were two 
glasses and some mix and an ice 
bucket and a fifth of liquor. 

"Now," said Flanders, happily, 
"perhaps we can talk some sense. 
I don't know what it is about 
the stuff, but put a drink into a 
man's hand and you tend to 
civilize him." 

He reached into the pocket of 
his robe, brought out a pack of 
cigarettes and passed them to 
Vickers. Vickers took the pack 
and saw that his hand was shaking a little as he pulled out a 
smoke. He hadn't realized until 
then just how keyed-up he was. 

Flanders snapped the lighter 
and held out the flame. Vickers 
got his light. 

"That's good," he said. "I ran 
out of smokes after the fourth 
day." 

He sat in the chair, smoking, 
thinking how good the tobacco 
tasted, feeling the satisfaction 
run along his nerves. He watched 
Hezekiah busy with the drinks. 

"I eavesdropped this morning," 
Vickers said. "I came here and 
Hezekiah let me in. I listened 
when you and some others were 
talking in the room." 

"I know you did," said Flanders. 

"How much of that was 
staged?" 



"All of it," said Flanders, 
blithely. "Every blessed word of 
it." 

"You wanted me to know I 
was an android?" 

"We wanted you to know." 

"You set the mouse on me?" 

"We had to do something to 
shake you out of your humdrum 
life. And the mouse served a 
special purpose." 

"It tattled on me." 

"Oh, exceedingly well. The 
mouse was a most efficient tattler." 

"The thing that really burns 
me," Vickers said, "is that business about making Cliffwood 
think I had done you in." 

"We had to get you out of 
there and headed back to your 
childhood haunts." 

"How did you know where 
I'd go?" 

FLANDERS said, "My friend, 
have you ever thought about 
the ability of hunch ? I don't 
mean the feeble hunch that is 
used on the racetrack to pick a 
winner or the hunch about 
whether it is going to rain or 
not, but the ability in the fullness 
of its concept. You might say it 
is the instinctive ability to assess 
the result of a given number of 
factors, to know, without actually 
thinking the matter out, what is 
about to happen. 

"It's almost like being able to 



148 




 



peck into the future." 

"Yes," said Vickers, "I have 
thought about it. A good deal in 
the last few days, as a matter of 
fact." 

"You have speculated on it?" 

"To some extent. But what 
has . . ." 

"Perhaps," said Flanders, "you 
have speculated that it might be 
a human ability that we never 
developed, that we scarcely knew 
was there and so never bothered 
with, or that it might be one of 
those abilities that it takes a long 
time to develop, a sort of an acein-the-hole ability for mankind's 
use when he was ready for it or 
might have need of it." 

"I did think that, or at least 
some of it, but . . ." 

"Now's the time we need it," 
Flanders interrupted again. "And 
that answers the question that 
you asked. We hunched you 
would go back." 

"At first I thought Crawford 
was the one, but he said he 
wasn't." 

Flanders shook his head. 
"Crawford wouldn't have done 
it. He needs you too badly. Your 
hunch on that one wasn't working too hot." 

"No, I guess it wasn't." 

"Your hunches don't work," 
said Flanders, "because you don't 
give them a chance. You still 
have the world of reason to contend with. You put your reliance 



on the old machinelike reasoning 
that the human race has relied 
on since it left the caves. You 
figure out every angle and you 
balance it against every other 
angle and you add up and cancel 
out as if you were doing a problem in arithmetic. You never 
give hunch a chance. That's the 
trouble with you." 

AND that was the trouble, 
Vickers thought. He'd had 
a hunch to spin the top on the 
porch of the Preston house. If 
he had done that, he'd have 
saved himself days of walking 
through the wilderness of this 
second world to get to this same 
spot. He'd had a hunch that he 
should have paid attention to 
Crawford's note and not driven 
the Forever car. If he'd done 
that, he'd have saved himself a 
lot of trouble. And there had 
been the hunch, which he had 
finally obeyed, that he must get 
back the top— and that one had 
paid off. 

"How much do you know?" 
asked Flanders. 

"I don't really know," Vickers 
admitted. "I know there's a mutant organization that had something to do with kicking the 
human race out of the rut you 
talked about, that night back in 
Cliffwood. And the organization 
has gone underground because 
its operations were getting too 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



149 



widespread and too significant 
to escape attention. You've got 
factories working, turning out the 
mutant gadgets you're using to 
wreck the economy of the old 
world. I saw one of those. Tell 
me, do the robots run it or . . ." 

Flanders chuckled. "The robots 
run it. We just tell them what 
we want." 



"Then there's this business of 
listening to the stars." 

"We've gotten many good 
ideas that way," said Flanders. 
"Not all of us can do it. Just 
some of us who are natural telepaths. And as I told you that 
night we talked, not all the ideas 
are ones that we can use. Sometimes we just get a hint of some



150 



GALAXY 



SCIENCE FICTION 



thing and we go on from there." 

"And where are you headed? 
Where do you intend to go?" 

"That's one that I can't answer. There are new possibilities 
being added all the time, new 
directions opening out. We're 
close to many great discoveries. 
For one thing, immortality. 
There is one listener . . ." 

"You mean," asked Vickers, 
"everlasting life?" 

"Why not?" 

OF course, thought Vickers, 
why not? If you had everlasting razor blades and everlasting light bulbs, why not 
everlasting life? 

"And androids?" Vickers asked. "Where would an android 
like myself fit in? Surely, an android can't be too important." 

"We have a job for you," said 
Flanders. "Crawford is your 
job." 

"What do I do with Crawford?" 

"You stop him." 

"Stop him? Me? Do you know 
what's back of Crawford?" 

"I know what's back of you." 

"Tell me," Vickers said. 

"The highest, most developed 
hunch ability that ever has been 
registered in a human being. The 
highest ever registered and the 
most unsuspected, the least used 
of any we have ever known." 

"Wait a minute. You're forget


ting that I'm not a human being." 

"Once you were. You will be 
again. Before we took your life 

"Took ray life!" 

"The life essence," said Flanders, "the mind, the thoughts 
and impressions and reactions 
that made up Jay Vickers — the 
real Jay Vickers — aged eighteen. 
Like pouring water from one vessel to another. We poured you 
from your body into an android 
body and we've kept and guarded your body against the day we 
can pour it back again." 

Vickers came half out of his 
chair. 

Flanders waved a hand at him. 
"Sit down. You were going to 
ask me why." 

"And you're going to answer 
me," said Vickers. 

"Certainly I will answer you. 
When you were eighteen, you 
were not aware of the ability you 
had. There was no way to make 
you aware of it. It would have 
done no good to tell you or to 
attempt to train you. You had 
to grow into it. We figured it 
would take fifteen years, but it 
took more than twenty and you 
aren't even yet as aware as you 
should be." 

"But I could have . . ." 
"Yes," said Flanders, "you 
could have grown aware of it in 
your own body, except that there 
is another factor — inherent mem

ory. Your genes carry the inherent memory factor, another 
mutation that occurs as infrequently as our telepathic listeners. Before Jay Vickers started 
fathering children, we wanted 
him to be entirely aware of his 
hunch ability." 

Vickers remembered how he 
had speculated on the possibility 
of inherent memory, while lying 
on the corn-shuck mattress in 
the loft of Andrews' house. Inherent memory, memory passed 
on from father to son. His father 
had known about inherent memory, so he had guessed it, too. 
-He had known about it, or at 
least he'd remembered it when 
the time had come for him to 
know about it, when he was 
growing — he groped for the word 
— aware. 

"So that is it," said Vickers. 
"You want me to put the hunch 
on Crawford and my children 
because they will have hunch, 
too." 

INLANDERS nodded. "I think 
we understand one another." 

"Yes," said Vickers. "I am 
sure we do. First of all, you want 
me to stop Crawford. That is 
quite an order. What if I put a 
price on it?" 

"We have a price. A most attractive price. I think it will 
interest you." 

"Try me." 



"You asked about Kathleen 
Prtston. You wanted to know 
if there was such a person and 
I can tell that there is. How old 
were you when you knew her, 
by the way?" 

"Eighteen." 

Flanders nodded idly. "A very 
fine age to be." He looked at 
Vickers. "Don't you agree?" 

"It seemed so then." 

"You were in love with her." 

"Of course." 

"And she was in love with 
you." 

"1 think so," Vickers said. "I 
can't be sure, but I think she 
was." 

"You may be assured that she 
was in love with you." 

"You will tell me where she 
is?" 

"No," said Flanders. 

"But you . . ." 

"When your job is done, you'll 
go back to eighteen again." 

"And that's the price," said 
Vickers. "That's the pay I get. 
To be given back a body that 
was mine to start with. To be 
eighteen again." 

"It is attractive to you?" 

"Yes, I guess so," Vickers said. 
"But don't you see, Flanders, 
the dream of eighteen is gone. 
It's not just the physical eighteen 
— it's the years ahead and the 
promise of those years and the 
wild, impractical dreaming and 
the love that walks beside you

in the spring of life." 

"Eighteen." said Flanders. 
"Eighteen and immortality and 
Kathleen Preston, herself seventeen again." 

"Kathleen?" 

Flanders nodded. 

"Just as it was before," said 
Vickers. "But it won't be the 
same, Flanders. Something that 
has slipped away." 

"Just as it was before," insisted Flanders. "As if all these 
years had never been." 

XXXV 

SO he was a mutant, after all, 
in the guise of android, and 
once he had stopped Crawford, 
he'd be an eighteen-year-old mutant in love with a seventeen year-old mutant and there was 
just a possibility that, before they 
died, the listener might pin down 
immortality. And if that were 
so, then he and Kathleen would 
walk enchanted valleys forever 
and they'd have mutant children 
and all of them would live a life 
such as the old pagan gods of 
Earth might have looked upon 
with envy. 

He threw back the covers and 
got out of bed and walked to 
the window. Standing there, he 
stated down at the moonlit enchanted valley where he'd walked 
that day of long ago and he saw 
that the valley was an empty 



place and would stay empty no 
matter what he did. 

He had carried the dream for 
more than twenty years and now 
that the dream was coming true, 
he saw that it was tarnished with 
all the time between, that there 
was no going back to that day 
in 1956, that a man never can 
go back to a thing he once has 
left. 

You could not wipe out the 
years of living, pile them neatly 
in a corner and walk away and 
leave them. They could be erased 
from your mind and they would 
be forgotten, but not forever, and 
the day would come when they'd 
break through again. And once 
they'd found you out, you'd 
know that you had lived not one 
lie, but two. 

That was the trouble, you 
couldn't hide away the past. 

The door creaked open and 
Vickers turned around. 

Hezekiah stood in the doorway, the dim light from the landing sparkling on his metal hide. 

"You cannot sleep?" asked 
Hezekiah. "Perhaps there's something I can do. A sleeping powder, perhaps, or . . ." 

"There is something you can 
do," said Vickers. "There's a 
record that 1 want to see." 

"A record, sir?". 
"My family record. You must 
have it here somewhere." 
"In the files, sir. I can get it 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



153 



right away, if you will wait." 

"And the Preston file as well," 
added Vickers. "The Preston 
family record." 

"Yes, sir," said Hezekiah. "It 
will take a moment." 

"%fICKERS turned on the light 
™ and sat down on the edge 
of the bed and he knew what he 
had to do. 

The enchanted valley was an 
empty place. The moonlight 
shattering on the whiteness of 
the pillar was a memory without 
life or color. The rose-scent upon 
the long-gone night of June had 
blown away with the wind of 
yesteryear. 

"Ann," he said, "I've been a 
fool too long. What about it, 
Ann? We've bantered and quarreled and we've used the bantering and the quarreling to cover 
the love that both of us have 
held. If it hadn't been for me 
and my dreaming of a valley, the 
dream growing cold and my 
never knowing it, we would have 
known long ago the way it was 
with us." 

They took from us, he thought, 
the birthright that was ours of 
living out our lives in the bodies 
in which we first knew the world. 
They've made of us neither man 
nor woman, but something that 
passes for a man and woman 
and we walk through the streets 
of life like shadows flickering 



down the wall. And now they 
would take from us the dignity 
of death and the realization that 
our task was done and they make 
us live a lie — I an android powered by the life-force of a man 
that is not myself, and you alive 
with a life that is not your own. 

"To hell with them," he said. 
"To hell with all this double 
living, with this being a manufactured mutant." 

He'd go back to Earth and 
find Ann Carter and he'd tell her 
that he loved her, not as one 
loved a moonlight - and - ros^s 
memory, but as a man and woman love. Together, they would 
live out what was left to them 
of life. He would write his books 
and she would go on with her 
work and they'd forget, as best 
they could, this matter of the 
mutants. 

He listened to the little murmurings of a house at night, 
unnoticed in the daytime when 
it is filled with human sounds. 
And he thought the record. would 
not tell the tale that he wished 
to know, would not tell all the 
truth that he hoped to find, but 
it would tell him who he'd been 
and something about that tattered 
farmer and his, wife who had 
been his father and his mother. 

THE door opened and Hezekiah pattered in, with a folder 
tucked beneath his arm. He 



154 




 



handed the folder to Vickers and 
stood to one side, waiting. 

Vickers opened it with trembling fingers and it was there 
upon the page. 

Vickers, Jay, b. Aug. 5, 1937, 
it. June 20, 1956, h.a., t, i.m., 
lat. 

He studied the line and it 
made no sense. 
"Hezekiah." 
"Yes, sir?" 

"What does all this mean?" 

"To what do you refer, sir?" 

"This line here," said Vickers, 
pointing. "This l.t. business and 
the rest of it." 

Hezekiah bent and translated: 
"Jay Vickers, born August 5, 
1937, life transferred June 20, 
1956, hunch ability, time sense, 
inherent memory, latent mutation. Meaning, sir, that you are 
unaware." 

"Thank you," said Vickers. 

"A pleasure, sir." 

He glanced at the. line above 
and there he found the names, 
placed on the bracketed lines that 
indicated marriage, from which 
the line bearing his own name 
sprouted. 

Charles Vickers, b. Jan. 10, 
1907, cont. Aug. 8, 1928, aw., t., 
el., i.m., s.a. Feb. 6, 1961. 

Sarah Graham, b. Apr. 16, 
1910, cont. Sept. 12, 1927, aw., 
ind. comm., t., i.m., s.a. Mar. 9, 
1960. 

His parents. Two paragraphs 



of symbols. He tried to make it 
out. 

"Charles Vickers, born January 
10, 1907, continued? No, that 
wouldn't be right . . ." 

"Contacted, sir," said Hezekiah. 

"Contacted August 8, 1928, 
aware, t., el. What's that?" 

"Time sense and electronics, 
sir." 

"Time sense?" 

"The other worlds. They are 
a matter of time, you know." 

"No, I didn*t know. Would 
you explain it, please?" 

"There is no time," said Hezekiah. "Not as the normal human 
thinks of time, that is. Not a 
continuous flow of time, but 
brackets of time, one second following behind the other. Although 
there are no seconds, no such 
things as seconds, no such measurement, of course." 

"That's right," said Vickers. 
It all came back to him, the 
explanation of those other worlds, 
the following worlds, each one 
encapsulated in a moment of 
time, in some strange and arbitrary division of time, each time 
bracket with its own world, how 
far back, how far ahead, no one 
could know or guess. 

SOMEWHERE inside him, the 
secret trigger had been tripped 
and the inherent memory was 
his, as it always had been his. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



but hidden in his unawareness, 
as his hunch ability still was. 

There was no time, Hezekiah 
had said. No such thing as time 
in the terms of normal human 
thought. Time was bracketed 
and each of its brackets contained 
a single phase of a universe so 
vastly beyond human comprehension that it brought a man 
up short against the impossibility 
of envisioning it. 

And time itself? Time was 
a never-ending medium that 
stretched into the future and the 
past — except there was no future 
and no past, but an infinite number of brackets, extending either 
way, each bracket enclosing its 
single phase of the Universe. 

Back on Man's original Earth, 
there had been speculation on 
traveling in time, of going back 
into yesterday or forward into 
tomorrow. And now he knew that 
you could not do it, that the 
same instant of time remained 
forever within each bracket, that 
Man's Earth had ridden the same 
bubble of the single instant from 
the time of its genesis and that 
it would die and come to nothing within that self-same instant. 

You could travel in time, but 
there would be no yesterday and 
no tomorrow. If you held a certain time sense, you could break 
out from one bracket to another, 
and when you did, you would 
not find yesterday or tomorrow. 



but another world. 

And that was what he had done 
when he had spun the top, except, of course, that the top had 
had nothing to do with it. It 
had simply been an aid. 

He went on with the line. 

"What is s.a., Hezekiah?" 

"Suspended animation, sir." 

"My father and my mother?" 

"Waiting for the day when the 
mutants finally achieve immortality." 

"But they died, Hezekiah!" 

"They would have died if they 
had been allowed to live. When 
there is that danger, mutants are 
kept in suspended animation until immortality becomes possible." 

The room was bright and cold 
and naked with the monstrous 
nakedness of truth. 

His mother and his father 
waited in suspended animation 
for the day they could have immortality ! 

And he, Jay Vickers, the real 
Jay Vickers, what of him? Not 
suspended animation, certainly, 
for the life was gone from the 
real Jay Vickers and was in this 
android body that sat in this 
room holding the family record 
in two android hands. 

"Kathleen Preston?" Vickers 
asked. 

Hezekiah shook his head. "I 
do not know about her, sir." 
"But you got the Preston 



156 




 



family record!" 

Hezekiah shook his head again. 
"I searched the cross-index, sir. 
There is no Preston mentioned. 
No Preston anywhere." 

XXXVI 

HE had made a decision and 
now the decision was no 
good — made impossible by the 
memory of two faces. He closed 
his eyes and remembered his 
mother, every feature, a little 
idealized, perhaps, but mainly 
true, and he recalled how she 
had been horrified by his adventure into fairyland and how Pa 
talked to him and how the top 
had disappeared. 

Of course the top had disappeared. Of course he had been 
lectured about too much imagination. After all, they probably 
had a hard enough time keeping 
an eye on him and knowing 
where he was without his wandering into other worlds. An 
eight-year-old would be hard 
enough to keep track of on one 
world, let alone all the others. 

The memory of his mother's 
face and of his father's hand upon 
his shoulder, with the fingers 
digging into his flesh with a manly tenderness — these were things 
no one could turn his back upon. 

In utter faith they waited, 
knowing that when the blackness 
came upon them, it would not 



be the end, but the beginning of 
an even greater adventure in living than they had hoped when 
they banded themselves with the 
little group of mutants so many 
years before. 

If they held such faith in the 
mutant plan, could his be any 
less? 

Could he refuse to do his part 
toward the establishment of that 
world for which they had done 
so much? 

They themselves had given 
what they could. The labor they 
had expended, the faith they had 
lavished must now be brought 
to realization by the ones they 
had left behind. He was one of 
those — and he knew he could not 
fail them. 

What kind of world? He 
thought he knew. 

An immortal world that had 
all the factors necessary to make 
immortality workable — endless 
economic living room, endless 
opportunity, endless challenges 
to the best efforts of one's being. 

Endless living room there was, 
even if one took only Earth into 
account, for there now lay open 
to Man's possession that endless 
ring around the Sun. 

But there also would be the 
Galaxy, with all its solar systems, and each of these solar 
systems would have its following 
worlds as well. Take all the 
planets that there were and mul


RING AROUND THE SUN 



157 



tiply them by infinity and you 
got a rough idea. 

Each world would be an opportunity and new techniques 
and new sciences would add to 
opportunity, so that Man, even 
eternal Man, need never fear the 
lack of opportunity or of challenge. 




,NCE you had immortality, 
what did you use, it for? 



You used it to keep up your 
strength. Even if your tribe were 
small, even if the birth rate were 
not large, even if new members 
of the tribe were discovered but 
infrequently, you still would be 
sure of growth if no one ever 
died. 

You used it to conserve ability 
and knowledge. If no one ever 
died, you could count on the 
ultimate strength and knowledge 
and ability of each member of 
the tribe. When a man died, his 
ability died with him and, to 
some extent, his knowledge. Yet 
it wasn't only that. You lost not 
only his present ability and 
knowledge, but all his future 
ability and knowledge. 

What knowledge, Vickers wondered, did the Earth now lack 
because certain persons died a 
dozen years too soon? Some of 
the knowledge, of course, would 
be recovered through the later 
work of others, but certainly 
there was much that could never 



be recovered, ideas that would 
not be dreamed again, concepts 
that were blotted out forever by 
the death of a brain in which the 
first faint stirring of their development had just begun to 
ferment. 

Within an immortal society, 
such a thing could never happen. 
An immortal society would be 
certain of total ability and total 
knowledge of its manpower. 

Take the ability to tap the 
knowledge of the stars, take inherent memory, the technical 
knowledge that made everlasting 
merchandise and add immortality. 

That was the formula — of 
what? Of the ultimate in life? 
Of the pinnacle of intellect? Of 
godhood itself? 

Go back a hundred thousand 
years. Consider the creature, 
Man. Give him fire, the wheel, 
the bow and arrow, domesticated 
animals and plants, plus tribal 
organization and the first, faint 
dawning concept of Man as the 
lord of Earth. Take that formula 
and what did you have? 

The beginning of civilization, 
the foundation of a human culture. 

The formula of the mutants, 
he knew, was simply another step 
upward as the fire-wheel-dog 
formula of a hundred thousand 
years before had been an earlier 
forward step. 




 



The mutant formula was not 
the end result of human effort 
nor of human intellect and knowledge; it was but a step. Within 
the human mind still dwelled the 
possibility of even greater steps, 
but what the concepts of those 
steps might be was as inconceivable to him as the time 
structure of the following worlds 
would have been to the man who 
discovered fire or tamed the dog. 

T¥7E still are savages, he 
" thought. We _still crouch 
within our cave, staring out beyond the fimoky fire that guards 
the entrance of our cave against 
the illimitable darkness that lies 
upon the world. 

Someday we'll plumb that 
darkness, but not yet. 

Immortality would be a tool 
that might help us plumb that 
darkness and that is all it is, a 
simple, ordinary tool. 

What was the darkness out 
beyond the cave's mouth? 

Man's ignorance of what he 
was or why he was or how he 



came to be and what his purpose 
and his end. The old, eternal 
questions. 

Perhaps with the tool of immortality Man could track down 
these questions, could gain an 
understanding of the orderly progression and the awful logic 
which fashioned and moved the 
Universe of matter and of energy. 

The next step might be a 
spiritual one, the finding and understanding of a divine pattern 
that was law unto the entire 
Universe. Might Man find at last, 
in all humility, a universal God 
— the Deity that men now worshiped with the faintness of human understanding and the 
strength of human faith? Would 
Man find at last the concept of 
divinity that would fill, without 
question and without quibble, 
Man's terrible need of faith, so 
clear and unmistakable that 
there could be no question and 
no doubt; a concept of goodness 
and of love with which Man 
could so identify himself that 
there would then be no need of

faith, but faith replaced with 
knowing and an everlasting sureness? 

And if Man outlawed death, he 
thought, if the doorway of death 
is closed against the final revelation and the resurrection, then 
surely Man must find such a 
concept or wander forever amid 
the galaxies a lost and crying 
thing. 

"Hezekiah," said Jay Vickers, 
"you are sure?" 

"Of what, sir?" 

"About the Prestons. You are 
sure there are none?" 

"Positive, sir. None whatever." 

"There was a Kathleen Preston," Vickers said. "I am sure 
there was." 



But how could he be so sure? 

For one thing, he remembered 
her. For another, Flanders said 
there was no such a person. 

But his memory could be conditioned and so could Flanders'. 

Kathleen Preston could be no 
more than an emotional factor 
designed to bind him to this 
house, a keyed-in response that 
would not let him forget, no matter where he went or what he 
might become, this house and the 
ties it held for him. 

"Hezekiah, who is Horton 
Flanders?" Vickers asked. 

"Horton Flanders." said the 
robot, "is an android, just the 
same as you."
