TEETHING RING by James Causey



wearing her new Chinese red 
housecoat, had just lustered her 
nails to a blinding scarlet, and 
Harry Junior was sleeping like an 
angel. 

' Yawning, Melinda answered 
the door and the little man said, 
beaming, "Excellent day. I have 
geegaws for information." 

Melinda did not quite recoil. 
He was perhaps five feet tall, 
with a gleaming hairless scalp 
and a young-old face. He wore 
a plain gray tunic, and a peddler's tray hung from his thin 
shoulders, 

"Don't want any," Melinda 
stated flatly. 

"Please." He had great, beseeching amber eyes. "They all 
say that. I haven'tjnuch time. I 
must be back at the University 
by noon." 

"You working your way 
through college?" 

He brightened. "Yes. I suppose you could call it that. Alien 
anthropology major." 

Melinda softened. The initiations those frats pulled nowadays 
— shaving the poor guy's head, 
eating goldfish — it was criminal. 

"Well?" she asked grudgingly. 
"What's in the tray?" 

"Flanglers," said the little man 
eagerly. "Oscillioscopes. Portable 
force-field generators. A neural 
distorter." Melinda's face was 
blank. The little man frowned. 
"You use them, of course? This 



is a Class IV culture?'' Melinda 
essayed a weak shrug and the 
little man sighed with relief. His 
eyes fled past her to the blank 
screen of the TV set. "Ah, a 
monitor." He smiled. "For a moment I was afraid — May I come 
in?" 

ll/JELINDA shrugged, opened 
-L" the door. This might be interesting, like a vacuum-cleaner salesman who had cleaned her 
drapes last week for free. And 
Kitty Kyle Battles Life wouldn't 
be on for almost an hour. 

"My name is Porteous," said 
the little man with an eager smile. 
"I'm doing a thematic on Class 
IV cultures." He whipped out a 
stylus, began jotting down notes. 
The TV set fascinated him. 

"It's turned off right now," 
Melinda said. 

Porteous's eyes widened impossibly. "You mean," he whisperedin .horror, "that you're exercising 
Class V privileges? This is terribly confusing. I get doors 
slammed in my face, when Class 
Fours are supposed to have a 
splendid gregarian quotient — you 
do have atomic power, don't 
you?" 

"Oh, sure," said Melinda uncomfortably. This wasn't going to 
be much fun. 

"Space travel?" The little face 
was intent, sharp. 

"Well," Melinda yawned, look

ing at the blank screen, "they've 
got Space Patrol, Space Cadet, 
Tales of Tomorrow . . ." 

"Excellent. Rocket ships or 
force-fields?" Melinrla blinked. 
"Does your husband own one?" 
Melinda shook her blonde head 
helplessly. "What are your economic circumstances?" 

Melinda took a deep rasping 
breath, said. "Listen, mister, is 
this a demonstration or a quiz 
program?" 

"Oh, my excuse. Demonstration, certainly. You will not mind 
the questions?" 

"Questions?" There was an 
ominous glint in Melinda's blue 
eyes. 

"Your delightful primitive customs, art-forms, personal habits — " 

"Look," Melinda said, crimsoning. "This is a respectable 
neighborhood, and I'm not answering any Kinsey report, understand?" 

The little man nodded, scribbling. "Personal habits are tabu? 
I so regret. The demonstration." 
He waved grandly at the tray. 
"Anti-grav sandals? A portable 
solar converter? Apologizing for 
this miserable selection, but on 
Capella they told me—" He followed Melinda's entranced gaze, 
selected a tiny green vial. "This 
is merely a regenerative solution. 
You appear to have no cuts or 
bruises." 



"Oh," said Melinda nastily. 
"Cures warts, cancer, grows hair, 
.1 suppose." 

Porteous brightened. "Of 
course. I see you can scan. Amazing." He scribbled further with 
his stylus, glanced up, blinked 
at the obvious scorn on Melinda's face. "Here. Try it." 

"You try it." Now watch him 
squirm! 

Porteous hesitated. "Would 
you like me to grow an extra 
finger, hair — " 

"Grow some hair." Melinda 
tried not to smile. 

The little man unstopped the 
vial, poured a shimmering green 
drop on his wrist, frowning. 

"Must concentrate." he said. 
"Thorium base, suspended solution. Really jolts the endocrines, 
complete control . . . see?" 

Melinda's jaw dropped. She 
stared at the tiny tuft of hair 
which had sprouted on that bare 
wrist. She was thinking abruptly, 
unhappily, about that chignon 
she had bought yesterday. They 
had let her buy that for eight 
dollars when with this stuff she 
could have a natural one. 

"How much?" she inquired 
cautiously. 

"A half hour of your time 
only," said Porteous. 

Melinda grasped the vial firmly, settled down on the sofa with 
one leg tucked carefully under 
her.

"Okay, shoot. But nothing personal." 

|>ORTEOUS was delighted. He 
*• asked a multitude of questions, most of them pointless, 
some naive, and Melinda dug 
into her infinitesimal fund of 
knowledge and gave. The little 
man scribbled furiously, clucking like a gravid hen. 

"You mean," he asked in 
amazement, "that you live in 
these primitive huts of your own 
volition?" 

"It's a G.I. housing project," 
Melinda said, ashamed. 

"Astonishing." He wrote: Feudal anachronisms and atomic 
power, side by side. Class Fours 
periodically "rough it" in backto- nature- movements. 

Harry Junior chose that moment to begin screaming for his 
lunch. Porteous sat, trembling. 
"Is that a Security Alarm?" 

"My son," said Melinda despondently, and went into the 
nursery. 

Porteous followed, and watched 
the ululating child with some 
trepidation. "Newborn?" 

"Eighteen months," said Melinda stiffly, changing diapers. 
"He's cutting teeth." 

Porteous shuddered. "What a 
pity. Obviously atavistic. 
Wouldn't the creche accept him? 
You shouldn't have to keep him 
here." 



"I keep after Harry to get a 
maid, but he says we can't afford 
one." 

"Manifestly insecure," muttered the little man, studying Harry 
Junior. "Definite paranoid tendencies." 

"He was two weeks premature," volunteered Melinda. "He's 
real sensitive." 

"I know just the thing," Porteous said happily. "Here." He 
dipped into the glittering litter 
on the tray and handed Harry 
Junior a translucent prism. "A 
neural distorter. We use it to 
train regressives on Rigel Two. 
It might be of assistance." 

Melinda eyed the thing doubtfully. Harry Junior was peering 
into the shifting crystal depths 
with a somewhat strained expression. 

"Speeds up the neural flow," 
explained the little man proudly. 
"Helps tap the unused eighty 
per cent. The pre -symptomatic 
memory is unaffected, due to automatic cerebral lapse in case of 
overload. I'm afraid it won't do 
much more than cube his present 
IQ, and an intelligent idiot is 
still an idiot, but — " 

"How dare you?" Melinda's 
eyes flashed. "My son is not an 
idiot! You get out of here this 
minute and take your — things 
with you." As she reached for 
the prism, Harry Junior squalled. 
Melinda relented. "Here." she

said angrily, fumbling with her 
purse. "How much are they?" 

"Medium of exchange?" Porteous rubbed his bald skull. "Oh, 
I really shouldn't — but it'll make 
such a wonderful addendum to 
the chapter on malignant primitives. What is your smallest denomination?" 

"Is a dollar okay?" Melinda 
was hopeful. 

Porteous was pleased with the 
picture of George Washington. 
He turned the bill over and over 
in his fingers, at last bowed low 
and formally, apologized for any 
tabu violations, and left via the 
front door. 

"Crazy fraternities," muttered 
Melinda, turning on the TV set. 

1^-ITTY KYLE was dull that 
morning. At length Melinda 
used some of the liquid in the 
greeh vial on her eyelashes, was 
quite pleased at the results, and 
hid the rest in the medicine 
cabinet. 

Harry Junior was a model of 
docility the rest of that day. 
While Melinda watched TV and 
munched chocolates, did and redid her hair, Harry Junior played quietly with the crystal prism. 

Toward late afternoon, he 
crawled over to the bookcase, 
wrestled down the encyclopedia 
and pawed through it, gurgling 
with delight. He definitely, Melinda decided, would make a fine 



lawyer someday, not a useless 
putterer like Big Harry, who 
worked all hours overtime in that 
damned lab. She scowled as 
Harry Junior, bored with the encyclopedia, began reaching for 
one of Big Harry's tomes on 
nuclear physics. One putterer in 
the family was enough! But when 
she tried to take the book away 
from him, Harry Junior howled 
so violently that she let well 
enough alone. 

At six-thirty, Big Harry called 
from the lab, with the usual 
despondent message that he 
would not be home for supper. 
Melinda said a few resigned 
things about cheerless dinners 
eaten alone, hinted darkly what 
lonesome wives sometimes did 
for company, and Harry said he 
was very sorry, but this might 
be it, and Melinda hung up on 
him in a temper. 

Precisely fifteen minutes later, 
the doorbell rang. Melinda opened the front door and. gaped. 
This little man could have been 
Porteous's double, except for the 
black metallic tunic, the glacial 
gray eyes. 

"Mrs. Melinda Adams?" Even 
the voice was frigid. 

"Y-Yes. Why—" 

"Major Nord, Galactic Security." The little man bowed. "You 
were visited early this morning 
by one Porteous." He spoke the 
name with a certain disgust. "He

left a neural distorter here. Correct?" 

Melinda's nod was tremulous. 
Major Nord came quietly into 
the living room, shut the door 
behind him. "My apologies, 
madam, for the intrusion. Porteous mistook your world for a 
Class IV culture, instead of a 
Class VII. Here—" He handed 
her the crumpled dollar bill. 
"You may check the serial number. The distorter, please." 

MELINDA shrunk limply onto the sofa. "I don't understand," she said painfully. "Was 
he a thief?" 

_ "He was — careless about his 
spatial coordinates." Major 
Nord's teeth showed in the faintest of smiles. "He has been 
corrected. Where is it?" 

"Now look," said Melinda with 
some asperity. "That thing's kept 
Harry Junior quiet all day. I 
bought it in good faith, and it's 
not my.fault — say, have you got 
a warrant?" 

"Madam," said the Major with 
dignity, "I dislike violating local 
tabus, but must I explain the impact of a neural distorter on a 
backwater culture? What if your 
Neanderthal had been given 
atomic blasters? Where would 
you have been today? Swinging 
through trees, no doubt. What if 
your Hitler had force-fields?" He 
exhaled. "Where is your son?" 



In the nursery, Harry Junior 
was contentedly playing with his 
blocks. The prism lay glinting in 
the corner. 

Major Nord picked it up carefully, scrutinized Harry Junior. 
His voice was very soft. 

"You said he was — playing 
with it?" 

Some vestigial maternal instinct prompted Melinda to 
shake her head vigorously. The 
little man stared hard at Harry 
Junior, who began whimpering. 
Trembling, Melinda scooped up 
Harry Junior. 

"Is that all you have to do — 
run around frightening women 
and children? Take your old distorter and get out. Leave decent 
people alone!" 

Major Nord frowned. If only he 
could be sure. He peered stonily 
at Harry Junior, murmured, 
"Definite egomania. It doesn't 
seem to have affected him. 
Strange." 

"Do you want me to scream?" 
Melinda demanded. 

Major Nord sighed. He bowed 
to Melinda, went out, closed the 
door, touched a tiny stud on his 
tunic, and vanished. 

"The manners of some people," 
Melinda said to Harry Junior. 
She was relieved that the Major 
had not asked for the green vial. 

Harry Junior also looked relieved, although for quite a different reason.

¥>IG HARRY arrived home a 
little after eleven. There were 
small worry creases about his 
mouth and forehead, and the 
leaden cast of defeat in his eyes. 
He went into the bedroom and 
Melinda sleepily told him about 
the little man working his way 
through college by peddling silly 
goods, and about that rude cop 
named Nord, and Harry said that 
was simply astonishing and Melinda said, "Harry, you had a 
drink!" 

"I had two drinks," Harry told 
her owlishly. "You married a 
failure, dear. Part of the experimental model vaporized, wooosh, 
just like that. On paper it looked 
so good — " 

Melinda had heard it all before. She asked him to see if 
Harry Junior was covered, and 
Big Harry went unsteadily into 
the nursery, sat down by his son's 
crib. 

"Poor little guy," he mused. 
"Your old man's a bum, a useless tinker. He thought he could 
send Man to the stars on a 
string of helium nucleii. Oh, he 
was smart. Thought of everything. Auxiliary jets to kick off 
the negative charge, bigger mercury vapor banks — a fine straight 
thrust of positive Alpha particles." He hiccuped, put his face 
in his hands. 

"Didn't you ever stop to think 
that a few air molecules could defocus the stream? Try a vac-' 
uum, stupid." 

Big Harry stood up. 

"Did you say something son?" 

"Gurfle," said Harry Junior. 

Big Harry reeled into the living room like a somnambulist. 

He got pencil and paper, began 
jotting frantic formulae. Presently he called a cab and raced 
back to the laboratory. 

MELINDA was dreaming 
about little bald men with 
diamond-studded trays. They 
were chasing her, they kept pelting her with rubies and emeralds, 
all they wanted was to ask questions, but she kept running, Harry 
Junior clasped tightly in her 
arms. Now they were ringing 
alarm bells. The bells kept ringing and she groaned, sat up in 
bed, and seized the telephone. 

"Darling." Big Harry's voice 
shook. "I've got it! More auxiliary shielding plus a vacuum. 
We'll be rich!" 

"That's just fine." said Melinda crossly. "You woke the 
baby." 

Harry Junior was sobbing bitterly into his pillow. He was sick 
with disappointment. Even the 
most favorable extrapolation 
showed it would take him nineteen years to become master of 
the world. 

An eternity. Nineteen years!
