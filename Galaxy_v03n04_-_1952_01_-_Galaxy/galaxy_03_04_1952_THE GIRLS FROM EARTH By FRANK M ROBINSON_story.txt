THE GIRLS FROM EARTH By FRANK M. ROBINSON 

"THE beasts aren't much 
I help, are they?" 
m Karl Allen snatched a 
breath of air and gave another 
heave on the line tied to the raft 
of parampa logs bobbing in the 
middle of the river. 

"No," he grunted, "they're not. 
They always balk at a time like 
this, when they can see it'll be 
hard work." 

Joseph Hill wiped his plump 
face and coiled some of the rope's 
slack around his thick waist. 

"Together now, Karl. One/ 
Two!" 

They stood knee-deep in mud 
on the bank, pulling and strain

ing on the rope, while somelew 
yards distant, in the shade of a 
grove of trees, their tiny yllumphs 
nibbled grass and watched them 
critically, but made no effort to 
come closer. 

"If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the 
list." 

Hill puffed and wheezed and 
took another hitch on the rope. 

"That's what I've been thinking about," he said, worried. 

They took a deep breath and 
hauled mightily on the raft rope. 
The raft bobbed nearer. For a 
moment the swift waters of the 
Karazoo threatened to tear it out 
of their grasp, and then it was 
beached, most of it solidly, on the 
muddy bank. One end of it «till 
lay in the gurgling, rushing 
waters, but that didn't matter. 
They'd be back in ten hours or 
to. long before the heavy raft 
could be washed free. 

"How much time have we got, 
Karl?" 

The ground was thick with 
shadows, and Karl cast a critical 
eye at them. He estimated that 
even with the refusal of their 
yllumphs to help beach the raft, 
they still had a good two hours 
before the rocket put down at 
Landing City. 

"Two hours, maybe a little 
more," he stated hastily when 
Hill looked more worried. "Time 



enough to get to Landing City 
and put in for our numbers on 

the list." 

He turned back to the raft, 
untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the 
backs of their reluctant mounts. 
He cinched his saddle and tied 
on some robes and furs behind it. 

Hill watched him curiously. 
"What are you taking the furs 
for? This isn't the trading 
rocket." 

"I know. I thought that when 
we come back tonight, it might 
be cold and maybe she'll appreciate the coverings then." 

"You never would have thought 
of it yourself," Hill grunted. 
"Grundy must have told you to 
do it, the old fool. If you ask me, 
the less you give tticm, the less 
they'll come to expect. Once you 
spoil them, they'll expect you to 
do all the trapping and the farming and the family-raising yourself." 

"You didn't have to sign up," 
Karl pointed out. "You could 
have applied for a wife from some 
different planet." 

"One's probably just as good 
as another. They'll all have to 
work the farms and raise families." 

Karl laughed and aimed a 
friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling up and headed 
into the thick forest. 




 



TT was quiet as Karl guided his 
mount along the dimly marked 
trail and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would 
be making that night. It would 
be nice to have somebody new 
to talk to. And it would be good 
to have somebody to help with 
the trapping and tanning, somebody who could tend the small 
vegetable garden at the rear of 
his shack and mend his socks and 
wash his clothes and cook his 
meals. 

And it was time, he thought 
soberly, that he started to raise a 
family. He was mid-twenty now, 
old enough to want a wife and 
children. 

"You going to raise a litter, 
Joe?" 

Hill started. Karl realized that 
he had probably been thinking 
of the same thing. 

''One of these days I'll need 
help around the sawmill," Hill 
answered defensively. "Need 
some kids to cut the trees, a 
couple more to pole them down 
the river, some to run the mill 
itself and maybe one to sell the 
lumber in Landing City. Can't do 
it all myself." 

He paused a moment, thinking 
over something that had just occurred to him. r 

"I've been thinking of your 
plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe 
I ought to have one for my wife 
to take care of, too." 



Karl chuckled. "I don't think 
she'll have the time!" 

They left the leafy expanse of 
the forest and entered the grasslands that sloped toward Landing 
City. He could even see Landing 
City itself on the horizon, a 
smudge of rusting, corrugated 
steel shacks, muddy streets, and 
the small rocket port — a scorched 
thirty acres or so fenced off with 
barbed wire. 

Karl looked out of the corner 
of his eye at Hill and felt a vague 
wave of uneasiness. Hill was a 
big, thick man wearing the soiled 
.clothes and bristly stubble of a 
man who was used to living alone 
and who liked it. But once he 
took a wife, he would probably 
have to keep himself in clean 
clothes and shave every few days. 
It was even possible that the 
woman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut. 

The path was getting crowded, 
more of the colonists coming onto 
the main path from the small 
side trails. 

Hill broke the silence first. "I 
wonder what they'll be like." 

Karl looked wise and nodded 
knowingly. "They're Earthwomen, Joe. Earth!" 

It was easy to act as though he 
had some inside information, but 
Karl had to admit to himself 
that he actually knew very little 
about it. He was a Second System colonist and had never even 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



•een an Earth woman. He had 
heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of 
them, some of them must have 
been true. Old Grundy at the 
rocket office, who should know 
about these things if anybody 
did, seemed disturbingly lacking 
on definite information, though 
he had hinted broadly enough. 
He'd whistle softly and wink an 
eye and repeat the stories that 
Karl had already heard; but he 
had nothing definite to offer, no 
real facts at all. 

Some of the other colonists 
whom they hadn't seen for the 
last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some 
of the carnival spirit. There was 
Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up 
the Karazoo: Leonard, who had 
the biggest farm on Midplanet; 
and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in 
yllumphs, whose name Karl 
couldn't remember. 

"They say they're good workers," Hill said. 

Karl nodded. "Pretty, too." 

They threaded their way 
through the crowded and muddy 
Streets. Landing City wasn't big. 
compared to some of the cities 
on Altair, where he had been 
raised, but Karl was proud of it. 
Some day it would be as big as 
any city on any planet — maybe 
even have a population of ten 



thousand people or more. 

"Joe" Karl said suddenly, 
"what's supposed to make women 
from Earth better than women 
from any other world?" 

Hill located a faint itch and 
frowned. "I don't know, Karl, It's 
hard to say. They're — well, sophisticated, glamorous." 

Karl absorbed this in silence. 
Those particular qualities were, 
he thought, rather hard to define. 

The battered shack that served 
as rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office 
on Midplanet loomed up in front 
of them. There was a crowd gathered in front of the building and 
they forced their way through to 
see what had caused it. 

"We saw this the last time we 
were here," Hill said. 

**I know," Karl agreed, "but 
I want to take another look." He 
was anxious to glean all the information that he could. 

It was a poster of a beautiful 
woman leaning toward the viewer. The edges of the poster were 
curling and the colors had faded 
during the last six months, but 
the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever. She held a longstemmed goblet in one hand and 
was blowing a kiss to her audience with the other. Her 
eyes sparkled, her smile was provocative. A quoted sentence read: 
"I'm from Earth!" There was 
nothing more except a printed

list of the different solar systems 
to which the colonial office was 
sending the women. 

She was real pretty, Karl 
thought. A little on the thin side, 
maybe, and the dress she was 
wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet, but she had a 
certain something. Glamor, maybe? 

A loudspeaker blared. 

"All colonists waiting for the 
wife draft assemble for your 
numbers! All colonists . . .** 

There was a jostling for places 
an<f then they were in the rapidly 
moving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out 



little blue slips with numbers on 
them, pausing every now and 
then to tell them some entertaining bit of information about the 
women. He had a great imagina* 
tion, nothing else. 

Karl drew the number 53 and 
hurried to the grassy lot beside 
the landing field that had been 
decorated with bunting and huge 
welcome signs for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with 
government pamphlets meant to 
be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went over and stvffed 
a few in his pockets. Other tnbles 
had been set out and were loaded 
with luncheon food, fixed by the 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



few colonial women in the community. Karl caught himself 
eying the women closely, wondering how the girls from Earth 
would compare with them. 

He fingered the ticket in his 
pocket. What would the woman 
be like who had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the 
rocket? For when it landed, they 
would pair up by numbers. The 
method had its drawbacks, of 
course, but time was much too 
short to allow even a few days of 
getting acquainted. He'd have to 
get back to his trapping lines and 
he imagined that Hill would have 
to get back to his sawmill and 
the others to their farms. What 
the hell, you never knew what 
you were getting either way, till 
it was too late. 

"Sandwich, mister? Pop?" 

Karl flipped the boy a coin, 
picked up some food and a drink, 
and wandered over to the landing 
field with Hill. There were still 
ten minutes or so to go before 
the rocket landed, but he caught 
himself straining his sight at the 
blue sky, trying to see a telltale 
flicker of exhaust flame. 

The field was crowded and he 
caught some of the buzzing conversation. 

". . . never knew one myself, 
but let me tell you ..." 

. . knew a fellow once who 
married one, never had a moment's rest afterward . . .** 



"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture . . .** 

". . . I'd give a lot to know the 
girl who's got number twentyfive . . ." 

"Let's meet back here with the 
girls who have picked our numbers," Hill said. "Maybe we 
could trade." 

Karl nodded, though privately 
he felt that the number system 
was just as good as depending on 
first impressions. 

There was a murmur from the 
crowd and he found his gaze riveted overhead. High above, in 
the misty blue sky, was a sudden 
twinkle of fire. 

He reached up and wiped his 
sweaty face with a muddy hand 
and brushed aside a straggly lock 
of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt 
to try to took his best. 

The twinkling fire came nearer. 

II 

" A MR. MacDONALD to see 
you, Mr. Escher," 

Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch. 

"Please send him right in." 

That was entirely superfluous, 
he thought, because MacDonalrJ 
would come in whether Escher 
wanted him to or not. 
, The door opened and shut with 
a slightly harder bang than usual 
and Escher mentally braced him

self. He had a good hunch what 
the problem was going to be and 
why it was being thrown jn their 
laps. 

MacOonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few 
minutes, just looking grim and 
not saying anything. Escher knew 
the psychology by heart. A short 
preliminary silence is always 
more effective in browbeating 
subordinates than an initial furious bluster; 

He lit a cigarette and tried to 
outwait MacDonald. It wasn't 
easy — ■ MacDonald had great 
staying powers, which was probably why he was the head of the 
department. 

Escher gave in first. "Okay, 
Mac, what's the trouble? What 
do we have tossed in our laps 
now?" 

"You know the one — colonization problem. You know that 
when we first started to colonize, 
quite a large percentage of the 
male population took to the stars, 
as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the 
frontier type all decided they 
wanted to head for other worlds, 
to get away from it all. The male 
of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the 
tiien left — but the women didn't. 
At least, not in nearly the same 
lf*rge numbers. 

"Well, you see the problem. 
The ratio of women to men here 



on Eafth is now something like 
five to three. If you don't know 
what that means, ask any man 
with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband -hunting isn't just 
a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's 
an earnest cutthroat business and 
I'm not just using a literary 
phrase." 

He threw a paper on Esther's 
desk. "You'll find most of the 
statistics about it in that, Claude. 
Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, 
badger games, poisonings, that 
kind of thing. It's quite a list. 
You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of 
which wouldn't have bothered 
the courts before. In fact, they 
wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they 
are now?" 

Escher shook his head blankly. 

"Most of the girls in the past 
who didn't catch a husband," 
MacDonald continued, "grew up 
to be the type of old maid who's 
dedicated to improving the morals and what-not of the rest of 
the population. We've got more 
puritanical societies now than we 
ever had, and we have more silly 
little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the 
pokey for things like violating a 
woman's privacy — whatever that 
means— and she's the one who 
decides whether what you say or 
do is a violation or not." 



THE O I ■ L S FIOM EARTH

Escher looked bored. "Not to 
mention the new prohibition 
which forbids the use of alcohol 
in everything from cough medicines to hair tonics. Or the 
cleaned up moral code that recks 
—if you'll pardon the expression 
— of purity. Sure, I know what 
you mean. And you know the 
solution. All we have to do is get 
the women to colonize." 

MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair. 

"But it won't be easy, and 
that's why it's been given to us. 
It's your baby, Claude. Give it a 
lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know." 

"Perpetual motion machines 
are," Escher said quietly. "And 
pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want 
to colonize. And who can blame 
them? Why should they give up 
living in a luxury civilization, 
with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to 
work their fingers to the bone and 
play footsie with wild animals 
and savages who would just as 
soon skin them alive as not?" 

"What do you advise I do, 
then?" MacDonald demanded. 
"Go back to the Board and tell 
them the problem is not solvable, 
that we can't think of anything?" 

Escher looked hurt. "Did I say 



that? I just said it wouldn't be 

easy." 

"The Board is giving ^ou a 
blank check. Do anything you 
think will pay off. We have to 
stay within the letter of the law, 
of course, but not necessarily the 
spirit." 

"When do they have to have a 
solution?" 

"As soon as possible. At least 
within the year. By that time the 
situation will be very serious. The 
psychologists say that what will 
happen then won't be good." 

"All right,_ by then we'll have 
the answer." 

MacDonald stopped at the 
door. "There's another reason 
why they want it worked out. 
The number of men applying to 
the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is 
falling off." 

"How come?" 

MacDonald smiled. "On the 
basis of statistics alone, would 
you want to emigrate from a 
planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?" 

When MacDonald had gone, 
Escher settled back in his chair 
and idly tapped his fingers on 
the desk-top. It was lucky that 
the Colonization Board worked 
on two levels. One was the wellpublicized, idealistic level where 
nothing was too good and every 
deal was 99 and 44/100 per cent 
pure. But when things got too 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



difficult for it to handle on that 
level, they went to Escher and 
MacDonald's department The 
coal mine level. Nothing was too 
low, so long as it worked. Of 
course, if it didn't work, you took 
the lumps, too. 

He rummaged around in his 
drawer and found a list of the 
qualifications set up by the Board 
for potential colonists. He read 
the list slowly and frowned. You 
had to be physically fit for the 
rigors of space travel, naturally, 
but some of the qualifications 
were obviously silly. You couldn't 
guarantee physical perfection in 
the second generation, anyway. 

He tore the qualification list in 
shreds and dropped it in the disposal chute. That would have to 
be the first to go. 

There were other things that 
could be done immediately. For 
One thing, as it stood now, you 
were supposed to be financially 
able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That 
would have to go next. 

He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left 
and read it carefully. The Board 
could legalize polygamy, but that 
was no solution in the long run. 
Probably cause more problems 
than it would solve. Even with 
women as easy to handle as they 
were nowadays, one was still 
enough. 

Which still left him with the 



main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't want 
to colonize. 

The first point was to convince 
them that they wanted to. The 
second point was that it might 
not matter whether they wanted 
to or not. 

No, it shouldn't be hard to 
solve at all — provided you held 
your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as 
a moral code. 

Ill 

OHYLLIS HANSON put the 
cover over her typewriter and 
locked the correspondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to begin. 

She filed into the washroom 
with the-other girls and carefully 
redid her face. It was getting hard 
to disguise the worry lines, to 
paint away the faint crow's-feet 
around her eyes. 

She wasn't, she admitted to 
herself for the thousandth time, 
what you would call beautiful. 
She inspected herself carefully in 
her compact mirror. In a sudden 
flash of honesty, she had to admit 
that she wasn't even what you 
would call pretty. Her face was 
too broad, her nose a fraction too 
long, and her hair was dull. Not 
homely, exactly — but not pretty, 
either. 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH

Conversation hummed around 
her, most of it from the little 
group in the corner, where the 
extreme few who were married 
sat as practically a race apart. 
Their advice was sought, their 
suggestions avidly followed. 

"Going out tonight, Phyl?" 

She hesitated a moment, then " 
slowly painted on the rest of her 
mouth. The question was technically a privacy violator, but she 
thought she would sidestep it this 
time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank. 

"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want 
to rinse out." 

The black-haired girl next to 
her nodded sympathetically. 
"Sure, Phyl, I know what you 
mean. Just like the rest of us — 
waiting for the phone to ring." 

Phyllis finished washing up 
find then left the office, carefully 
noting the girl who was waiting 
for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard sort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's 
busty figure. Waiting for a 
plump, middle-aged man like a 
stagestruck kid outside a theatre. 

At home, in her small tworoom bachelor-girl apartment, 
•he stripped and took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and 
toweled herself in front of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You 
didn't know whether you should 
keep yourself in trim just on some 



off-chance, or give up and let 
yourself go. 

She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the 
dishes, and went throu gh the 
standard routine of getting a 
book and curling up on the sofa. 
It was a good book of the bootlegged variety — scientifically 
written with enough surplus 
heroes and heroines and lushly 
described love affairs to hold anybody's interest. 

It held hers for ten pages and 
then she threw the book across 
the room, getting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped 
and Muttered to the Moor. 

What was the use of kidding 
herself any longer, of trying to 
live vicariously and hoping that 
some day she would have a home 
and a husband? She was thirty 
now; the phone hadn't rung in 
the last three years. She might as 
well spend this evening as she 
had spent so many others — call 
up the girls for a bridge game and 
a little gossip, though heaven 
knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping 
about. 

Perhaps she should have joined 
one of the organizations at the 
office that did something like that 
seven nights out of every seven, 
A bridge game or a benefit for 
some school or a talk on art. Or 
v she could have joined the Lecture 
of the Week club, or the YWCA, 




 



or any one of the other government-sponsored clubs designed to 
fill the void in a woman's life. 

But bridge games and benefits 
and lectures didn't take the place 
of a husband and family. She was 
kidding herself again. 

She got up and retrieved the 
battered book, then went over to 
the mail slot. She hadn't had time 
to open her mail that morning; 
most of the time it wasn't worth 
the effort. Advertisements for 
book clubs, lecture clubs, how to 
win at bridge and canasta . . . 

Her fingers sprang the metal 
tabs on a large envelope and she 
took out the contents and spread 
it wide. 

She gasped. It was a large 
poster, about a yard square. A 
man was on it, straddling a tiny 
city and a small panorama of 
farms and forests at his feet. He 
was a handsome specimen, with 
wavy blond hair and blue eyes 
and a curly mat on his bare chest 
that was just enough to be attractive without being apelike. He 
held an axe in his hands and was 
eying her with a clearly inviting 
look of brazen self-confidence. 

It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the 
authorities immediately! 

Bright lettering at the top of 
the poster shrieked: "Come to 
the Colonies, the Planets of Romance 1" 

Whoever had mailed it should 



be arrested and imprisoned! Prey' 
ing on . . . 

The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and 
figures. The need for women out 
on the colony planets, the percentage of men to women — a 
startling disproportion — the comfortable cities that weren't nearly 
as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced 
qualifications. 

She caught herself admiring 
the man on the poster. Naturally, 
it was an artist's conception, but 
even so . . . 

And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, 
where you had to battle disease 
and dirty savages. 

It was all a dream. She had 
never done anything like this and 
she wouldn't think of doing it 
now. And had any of her friends 
seen the poster? Of course, they 
probably wouldn't tell her even if 
they had. 

Bur the poster was a violation 
of privacy. Whoever had sent it 
had taken advantage of information that was none of their business. It was up to her to notify 
the authorities! 

QHE took another look at the 
^ poster. 

The letter she finally finished 
writing was very short. She addressed it to the box number in 
the upper left-hand corner of the 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH

plain wrapper that the poster 
had come in. 

IV 

HpHE dress lay on the counter, 
a small corner of it trailing 
off the edge. It was a beautiful 
thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed 
in gold nylon thread. It was the 
kind of gown that would make 
anybody who wore it look beautiful. The price was high, much 
too high for her to pay. She knew 
she would never be able to buy 
it. 

But she didn't intend to buy it. 

She looked casually around 
and noted that nobody was 
watching her. There was another 
woman a few counters down and 
a man, obviously embarrassed, at 
the lingerie counter. Nobody else 
was in sight. It was a perfect 
time. The clerk had left to look 
up a difficult item that she had 
purposely asked for and probably 
wouldn't be back for five minutes. 

Time enough, at any rate. 

The dress was lying loose, so 
she didn't have to pry it off any 
hangers. She took another quick 
look around, then hurriedly bundled it up and dropped it in her 
shopping bag. 

She had taken two self-assured 
steps away from the counter 
when she felt a hand on her 
shoulder. The grip was firm and 
muscular and she knew she had 




 



lost the game. She also knew that 
she had to play it out to the end, 
to grasp any straw. 

"Let go of me!" she ordered in 
' a frostily offended voice. 

"Sorry, miss," the man said 
politely, "but I think we have a 
short trip to take." 

She thought for a moment of 
brazening it out further and then 
gave up. She'd get a few weeks or 
months in the local detention 
building, a probing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted her to steal, 
and then she'd be out again. 

They couldn't do anything to 
her that mattered. 

She shrugged and followed the 
detective calmly. None of the 
shoppers had looked up. None 
seemed to notice anything out of 
the ordinary. 

In the detention building she 
thanked her good luck that she 
was facing a man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies who served 
on the bench. She even found a 
certain satisfaction in the presence of the cigar smoke and the 
blunt, earthy language that 
floated in from the corridor. 

"Why did you steal it?" the 
judge asked. He held up the 
dress, which, she noted furiously, 
didn't look nearly as nice as it 
had under the department store 
lights. 

"I don't have anything to say," 



she said. "I want to see a lawyer.** 
She could imagine what he was 
thinking. Another tough one, another plain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill. 

And she probably was. You 
had to do something nowadays. 
You couldn't just sit home and 
chew your fingernails, or run out 
and listen to the endless boring 
lectures on art and culture. 

"Name?" he asked in a tired 
voice. 

She knew the statistics he 
wanted. "Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 
pounds, brown hair and green 
eyes. Prints on file." 

The judge leaned down and 
mentioned something to the bailiff, who left and presently came 
back with a ledger. The judge 
opened it and ran his fingers 
down one of the pages. 

The sentence would probably 
be the usual, she thought — six 
months and a fine, or perhaps a 
little more when they found out 
she had a record for shoplifting. 

A stranger in the courtroom in 
the official linens of the government suddenly stepped up beside 
the judge and looked at the page. 
She could hear a little of what he 
said :

"In view of some complicating

factors, we're going to give you a 
choice," the judge finally said. 
**You can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a 
$10,000 fine, or you can ship out 
to the colony planets and receive 
a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus." 

She thought for a minute that 
she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! It 
was obvious that the state was 
interested in neither the fine nor 
in paying her room and board for 
ten years. She could recognize a 
squeeze play when she saw it, 
but there was nothing she could 
do about it. 

"I wouldn't call that a choice," 
she said sourly. "I'll ship out."

SUZANNE was proud of the 
apartment. It had all the 
modern conveniences, like the 
needle shower with the perfume 
dispenser, the built-in soft-drink 
bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the electrical 
massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of security in an ever-changing world. 

She lit a cigarette and chuckled. 
Mrs. Burger, the fat old landlady, 
thought she kept up the apartment by working as a buyer for 
one of the downtown stores. 

Well, maybe some day she 
would. 



But not today. And not tonight. 

The phone rang and she answered in a casual tone, She 
talked for a minute, then let a 
trace of sultriness creep into her 
voice, The conversation wasn't 
long. 

She let the receiver fall back 
on the base and went into the 
bedroom to get a hat box. She 
wouldn't need much; she'd probably be back that same night. 

It was a nice night and since 
the address was only a few blocks 
away, she decided to walk it. She 
blithely ignored the curious stares 
from other pedestrians, attracted 
by the sharp, clicking sound of 
her heels on the sidewalk. 

The address was a brownstone 
that looked more like an office 
building than anything else, but 
then you could never tell. She 
pressed the buzzer and waited a 
moment for the sound to echo 
back and forth on the inside. She 
pressed it again and a moment 
later a suave young man appeared in the doorway. 

"Miss Carstens?" 

She smiled pertly. 

"We've been expecting you." 

She wondered a little at the 
"we," but dutifully smiled and 
followed him in. 

The glare of the lights inside 
the office blinded her for a moment. When she could focus them 
again, her smile became slightly 
blurry at the edges and then dis



 



appeared entirely. She wasn't 
alone. There was a battery of 
■ chairs against one side of the 
room. She recognized most of the 
girls sitting in them. 

She forced a smile to her lips 
and tried to laugh. 

"I'm sure there's been some 
mistake! Why, I never . . ." 

The young man coughed politely. "I'm afraid there's been no 
mistake. Full name, please." 

"Suzanne Carstens," she said 
grimly, and gave the other statistics he wanted. She idly won-i 
dered what stoolie had peddled 
the phone numbers. 

"Suzanne Carstens," the young 
man noted, and slowly shook his 
head. "A very pretty name, but 
no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't matter, though. Take 
a seat over there." 

She did as he asked and he 
faced the entire group. 

"I and the other gentlemen 
here represent the Colonization 
Board. We've interceded with the 
local authorities in order to offer 
you a choice. We would like to 
ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will pay you 
the standard emigration bonus of 
five hundred dollars. The colonists need wives; they offer you 
—security." 

, He stressed the word slightly. 

"Now, of course, if you don't 
prefer the colony planets, you 
can stay behind and face the pen


alties of ten years in jail and a 
fine of ten thousand dollars." 

Suzanne felt that her lower jaw 
needed support. Ten thousand 
dollars and ten years! And in 
either case she'd lose the apartment she had worked so hard for, 
her symbol of security. 

"Well, what do you say?" 
There was a dead silence. The 
young man from the Colonization 
Board turned to Suzanne. "How 
about you, Miss Carstens?" 

She smiled sickly and nodded 
her head. "I love to travel!" she 
said. 

It didn't sound at alt witty 
even to herself.

HpHE transfer shed was a vast 
and somber terminal, cold 
and impersonal. There was a 
cleared space at the center of the 
floor where the officials had desks 
and tables and rows of filing cabinets and busily clicking machinery. The women sat huddled 
around the edges of the shed, 
waiting to be called to the center 
and assigned to any of the various colony planets. 

Phyllis clutched her small suitcase, containing the few personal 
items she had been allowed to 
take on the trip, and silently 
swore that once she set foot on 
another planet, she'd never leave 
it, no matter what.

"Draft 49 for the Huffer Solar 
System report to the routing 
desk! Draft 49 for the Huffer 
Solar System report to the routing desk!" 

"That's us," Suzanne said 
drily. She and Phyllis and Ruby 
joined the others out on the floor. 

"You understand," the routing 
official was saying, "that you're 
allowed your choice of planets 
in the Huffer Solar System. We'll 
read off occupational and other 
pertinent information and then 
you make your choice. 

"Sunside: First planet from the 
system sun. Warm, humid climate. Fishing, flower-growing for 
export, mining, and natural 
handicrafts. Population ratio 7 
to 1, males all somatypes and 
admixtures. 

"Midplanet: Second planet 
out. Temperate climate. Farming, fur-trapping, slight manufacturing. Ratio 7 to 1, all somatypes and admixtures." 

"Newman's body, last planet 
out from the system sun . . ." 

He finished the list and gave 
them five minutes to decide. The 
names of the three planets appeared on the floor in glowing 
letters. When they had made up 
their minds, they were to go and 
stand on the name. 

They held a short conference. 

"It looks like it's a tossup between fish and furs," l?uby said. 
"I think I'll take Midplanet. I 



like furs better than fish." 

They argued a moment longer, 
then picked up their belongings 
and went and stood on the luminous letters.

NO doubt of it, the carpet made 
a fairly suitable green, Escher 
thought. He placed the ball firmly on the nap, stepped back a 
pace, and tapped it smartly with 
the golf club. It rolled in a beautifully straight path into the upturned water glass, 

"Very nice shot, Claude." 
Escher looked up and leaned 
the club against the side of the 
desk. 

"I thought so, too," he Agreed. 
"What brings you here, Mac?" 

MacDoneld sat down and 
poured himself a glass of water 
from the beaker on Escher*s desk. 

"Just wanted to pass on the 
compliments of the Board for the 
recent large upswing in woman 
emigrants to the colony planets.** 

Escher casually waved it aside. 

"It wasn't much. We just had 
to rid ourselves of some oldfashioned notions, that's all. I 

was afraid, though, that the 
Board might disapprove of our 
methods." 

MacDonald thought for a moment. 

"No, 1 guess they didn't. I 
caa't recall any members of the 



N 




 



Board complaining about it, at 
least. Apparently they felt that 
something drastic was needed. Or, 
more probably, they've kept 
themselves carefully ignorant of 
just how we did it. Oh, they know 
we violated privacy in a lot of 
cases, but they're willing to overlook it." 

"Very white of them, I'm 
sure," Escher grunted. He took 
up the club and set the ball back 
on its carpet tee. "How about a 
game tomorrow afternoon?" 

MacDonald shook his head. "It 
didn't bother the Board much, 
Claude, but I followed your advertising and I was down to the 
port to see a contingent of our 
new colonists take off. It bothers 
me, Claude. The ads you sent to 
the different planets, the whispering campaign we arranged for, 
the subtle propaganda we sent 
out — and then the women. Don't 
yon think there will be some sort 
of howl? We've definitely led 
them to believe one thing and 
here we're sending them — well, 
the new colonists leave a lot to 
be desired." 

Escher looked at him coldly. 
"Look, Mac, let's be cynical 
about this. That's why it was referred to us in the first place. Of 
course the girls we sent aren't the 
most beautiful or the most glamorous. Those girls are already 
married and you couldn't get 
them to leave, no matter what 



you did. The girls we sent are 
the ones who weren't wanted here 
on Earth. We even killed two 
birds with one stone and solved 
the crime problem." 

He held up his hand when 
MacDonald started to object. 

"Don't say it. Mac. Stop and 
think for a moment. What danger 
can a shoplifter do on a colony 
planet? There's nothing to steal. 
And without large cities, most 
other types of crime will have 
equally tough sledding. Besides, 
we eliminated those who had 
natural criminal tendencies. Most 
of the others had drifted into it 
as an outlet for their sense of 
insecurity, the feeling of not being 
wanted." 

MacDonald looked worried. 

"All right, what happens when 
the colonists find out, Claude? 
What happens when they find 
out we shipped them the castoffs, 
the leftovers?" 

"The point is, Mac, they'll 
never find out. They're Second 
System colonists. You know how 
the Colonization Board works. 
Planet A colonizes planet B. 
Planet B colonizes planet C. 
Given a suitable number of generations, the people on planet C 
will never have seen people from 
planet A. Earth is planet A. the 
colony planets to which the 
women were sent are all planet 
Cs. 

"You sec, the catch is that ihe 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



97 



colonists will have no basis on 
which to make comparisons. 
They've never seen women from 
Earth!" 

"I still don't like it. They- have 
seen women from other planets. 
After taking a look at the last 
shipload of females that left 
Earth, I'm still worried." 

Escher laughed. "That's because you haven't seen some of 
the colony women, Mac. Tell me, 
what is the most cultured and 
socially up-to-date planet? Earth, 
of course. Now on what planet 
has husband-hunting and pleasing been developed into an allout struggle with fine scientific 
techniques? Earth, again. The 
colonists don't have a chance. 

"When it comes to catching 
and pleasing the male, the girls 
from Earth have really had an 
education. They can take care 
of themselves. Don't worry about 
that. Who's to tell the colonists 
the girls aren't the cream of the 
crop, anyway? Not the girls 
themselves, certainly. And not 
us. I tell you they'll never find 
out, Mac." 

"You're positive that the colonists will be pleased with the 
women?" 

Escher hesitated. "Well, reasonably." He sounded a little 
wistful He practiced his swing a 
few more times, barely, missing 
the lamp on his desk. 

"I thought the advertising was 



rather clever, too. They'll feel a 
great obligation to us for sending 
them 'Earth's Fairest Daughters.' 
Be good for strengthening the ties 
to the mother planet." 

MacDonald looked somewhat 
happier. 

"What about the women themselves, though? We sold them a 
bill of goods, too, you know. 
They're expecting modern cities 
and handsome, rugged heroes for 
husbands. I know damn well that 
a lot of the colonies aren't much 
more than sinkholes and I suspect the sanitary, rugged, 
thoughtful male is strictly off the 
artist's drawing board. What 
happens when the women find 
that out?" 

Escher took the ball out of the 
glass and went back a few paces 
for another try. 

"Don't forget, Mac, the girls 
are the ones who weren't wanted 
here, the ones who were heading 
up for lives as old maids. They're 
going to planets where they're 
strictly a scarce item, where 
they'll be appreciated. The colonists will think they're getting 
something special and they'll 
treat the girls that way. They'll 
take good care of them. There 
might be a few difficulties at first, 
but it'll come out all right." 

"In other words, the whole 
thing hinges on how the colonists 
receive the girls. Isn't that it?" 

The ball thunked solidly into 



THE GIRLS FROM IARTH 



the glass again and rolled out. 

"That's Tight. We've hedged 
our bets the best we can. Now 
we'll have to wait and see, But 
I don't think we have anything 
to worry about." 

"Uh-huh," MacDonald grumbled. "It works out nice in theory, 
but I wonder how it'll be in practice.**

pHYLLIS let the deceleration 
■*- press her into the cot and 
tried to relax. In ten minutes they 
would be disembarking in Landing City. Landing City, with its 
wide, paved streets and modern 
buildings, the neatly laid-out 
farms and the modern rocket 
port. 

There was a clanging of bells, 
a sudden feeling of nausea, and 
she knew they had landed. In 
the excited buzz of conversation 
from the others, she got her small 
suitcase and filed toward the 
hatch. 

They took her name and gave 
her the emigration bonus, and 
then she was on the ramp going 
down, smelling the cool fresh air 
and feeling a damp breeze against 
her face. 

She looked down , . , 

The modern rocket port was a 
scorched expanse of dirty ground, 
with a rusting shed at one end 
that she guessed was the office. 



Landing City was a collection of 
rundown shacks and corrugated 
huts with mud streets and wooden sidewalks running between 
them. 

She should have guessed, she 
thought bitterly. She had been 
sold a bill of goods. And there 
was no going back now; she was 
Stuck with it. 

Stuck with it. 

She took another look. At least 
it would be healthy, and there 
was something besides the concrete and granite of a city to look 
at. It wouldn't be day in and day 
out of sitting eight hours behind 
a typewriter, and then back to 
her lonesome two rooms for an 
evening of bridge or a night with 
a boring book. 

And there was nothing wrong 
with the town that couldn't be 
remedied and improved with a 
little work. She and the others 
would see to that. Progress was 
going to hit Landing City 
whether the colonists like it or 
not. , 

The colonists . . . 

She stared at the whiskery, 
ragged lot of men of all shapes 
and sizes that were waiting to 
welcome them. 

They had probably, she 
thought queerly, never heard a 
lecture on art in their lives. And 
they wouldn't have any interest 
in historical novels and it was an 
even-money bet that bridge and 



KM 




 



canasta games would bore them. 

They were uncultured, she 
thought happily, thoroughly uncultured! Their main interest was 
probably in having a home and 
raising a family and working . . , 

And with a shave and clean 
clothes, they might even be handsome ! A dimly remembered 
poster of a blond-haired giant 
flashed into her mind, but she 
dismissed it. The men below had 
a hard, healthy look about them, 
a certain virility, an individuality 
that the pale men back on Earth, 
now that she thought of it, 
seemed to lack. 

She was very definitely going 
to like it here. 

Then she had a sudden, nagging thought. i 

How would the colonists take 
to her and the other bedraggled 
females ?

f"pHE twinkling fire came nearer and they could make out 
the outlines of the slim ship. It 
rapidly grew in size and finally 
settled to a heavy, groaning rest 
on the pitted and blackened 
landing field. 

Karl was holding his breath, 
staring at the outline of the hatch 
on the ship's rusty side. It opened 
and tfie flight of descent staira 
slid out. The captain and crew 
came out first. 

Then the women filed down the 
ladder, smiling timidly and looking cold and frightened. 

Karl could hear Hill gulping 
noisily beside him and knew that 
his own mouth was gaping. But 
he couldn't help it. 

The girls were gorgeous.
