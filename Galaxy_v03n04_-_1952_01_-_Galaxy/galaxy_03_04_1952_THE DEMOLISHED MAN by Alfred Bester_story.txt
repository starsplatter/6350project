THE DEMOLISHED MAN by Alfred Bester

Opportunity, encounter or reencounter . . . all of them may be 
reproduced precisely and exactly 
over and over again on the planet 
of a sun in the Galaxy that revolves once in two hundred million years and has revolved nine 
times already. 

There are and have been worlds 
and cultures without end, each 
perhaps (_unaware of. the sobering 
mortification of statistics) nursing the proud illusion that it is 
unique, irreplaceable, irrepro-duceahle. There have been men 
without end, suffering from the 
same megalomania, who have 
made nations and worlds suffer 
too. There wilt be mote, more 
plus infinity. This is the story of 
much a man . . . The Demolished 
Man. 

ON Sol Double -3 (for the Cosmic Eye sees Earth and her 
moon as a planetary binary) in 
January of 2103, Edward Tuxnbul of Coates Teachers College 
decided to explore the Hysterisis 
Enigma for his research thesis. 
The Reamur Variations on the 
Einstein Post-mortem Equations 
had suggested a paradox whirh 
no one had bothered to explore. 
Atomic research had bypassed it; 
and what are the dead ends of 
science for if not to provide harm-. 
less occupation for graduate students? Turnbul studied the 
original research, ran a few du


plications and then tinkered with 
the apparatus. 

Get the picture: A serious 
young man, fat, sallow, a genuine 
bore. . A Phi Beta Kappa anesthetising his frustrations in a laboratory. A magnet is his sweetheart; caulds of X-27 Duplexor 
are his conjugal embraces. He 
tinkers at midnight and sublimates his maladjustments in the 
excitement and suspense of the 
experiment. Will it work? Can he 
really develop a commercial 
process, earn a million dollars 
and overpower women with this 
uncontestable proof of his virility? 

Turnbul unwraps a sandwich, 
aping the dashing insouciance of 
fictional heroes, then pulls the 
switch. The experiment works. 
Thirty -two pounds of apparatus 
and a liter of methylene dimethyl 
Tther loft up from the bench and 
smash against the ceiling. Turnbul has stumbled on something 
they just missed a century ago . . . 
ant'i-gravity. Unique? No. Inevitable. In the infinity of a universe 
crawling with searching, inquiring, experimenting creatures, this 
had happened, was happening 
and would happen beyond the 
count of simple integers. Statistics made it inevitable. 

Forget Turnbul. He is not your 
protagonist. If you identify with 
him, you will he lost in this story, 
as Turnbul htftiself is lost in the

shifting pattern that produced 
the Demolished Man. Turnbul 
patented; he was sued. He fought 
in courts for fifteen years with inadequate counsel and the patent 
was broken. Turnbul was notorious enough by that time to re-r 
eeive a full professorship at the 
Institute. He married a librarian, 
raised children, taught miserably, 
and jealously inspected each new 
textbook, content if credit for 
Nulgee was paid him in footnote 
or appendix. 

¥N September of 2110, Galen 
■* Gart's wife died. She was a 
tall, lustrous, remote woman, and 
he had loved her deeply for thirty 
years. They had been a devoted 
couple, and in the course of their 
marriage had grown to resemble 
each other, as couples often do. 
It was hard to distinguish their 
handwriting, their voices, their 
jokes. 

"We even think alike," Gart 
used to say. "Half the time I answer her before I realize she 
hasn't had a chance to speak her 
thoughts." And after her death 
he said : "What's the use of going 
on? We were part of each other. 
We didn't need words. How can 
anyone else give me the same intimacy?" 

But Galen Gart, fifty, desolate, 
prematurely aging, met a pungent child of twenty with an- exciting poi trine, a satin skin, and 



the infantile nickname of Duffy, 
and they were married six months 
after the funeral. 

"You're not so old in the dark," 

"Why, Duffy !" exclaimed Mr. 
Gart. "What a nice thing to say." 

"But I didn't say anything.** 
Nor had she. 

It was a year before Mr. Gart 
realized that it was he who didn't 
need words. It became his joke, 
his little parlor trick, a quaint 
trait. 

"So this is the famous Galen 

Gart. Mind reader? Imposs. 

Tricks. Can't fool me. Can't read 

my mind." 

"But I can, dear lady. I can.** 
"You ca — But I didn't say it. 

I—" 

"Hey! Everybody! Gart's done 
it again." 

"Look at her blush." 

"What's she thinking, Gart?** 

"Why's she blushing?" 

"The lady," Mr. Gart smiled, 
"is thinking that I'm laughing at 
her. She's blushing because I'm 
telling her I admire her. She has 
one of the loveliest minds I have 
ever met." 

Laughter. 

Oh yes; laughter at the quaint 
trait when gentle, tactful, courteous Mr. Gart performed his 
parlor trick. But the trait was an 
extracted recessive that appeared 
in his son. 

There was no more laughter 
when the amoral animal that a 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



7 



child is discovered it had inherited Extra Sensory Perception and 
used it brutally. Galon Gart, Jr., 
turned laughter to tears, and 
many texts were written about 
his lurid criminal career that 
ended with his murder. And 
Galen Gart, Jr., Esper blackmailer, confidence trickster and 
thief, helped produce The Demolished Man. 

THE vacant lot across the way 
from Sheridan Place was finally sold, and Space Clubs, Inc., 
was forced to move its Raffle 
Office and prizes to Brooklyn. 
Their funds barometer, a miniature explosive rocket hanging 
halfway up an illuminated cotumn calibrated in thousands of 
dollars, was abandoned. The lot 
was turned into a block of experimental al fresco stores, without 
walls or roof, protected from the 
elements and casual theft by 
the new Donaldson Resistance 
Hedge, an invisible bubble of radiation that scintillated in wet 
weather with the prismatic glitter 
of oil on water. 

The center shop, alongside the 
entrance to the Pneumatique Station, was taken in 99 year lease 
by Wilson Winter, an ambivalent 
artist turned bookseller, who purchased one lot of odds and ends 
for the benefit of literature, and 
conducted a thriving trade in 
pornography for the benefit of his 



purse. Among the worthless items 
in the odds & ends was Let's Play 
Party by Nita Noyes. It collected 
dust on the shelf until it was 
bought by The Demolished Man. 

REALISM IS 4TH DIMENSION 

Y^LATON QUINN, brilliant 
young producer^of Pantys, attributes his phenomenal success 
to close attention to detail. In 
an exclusive interview with yr recarder tie said : "People forget 
that 'Panty' is slang for Emotional Pantograph. When you get 
five thousand people into a theatre to see a Panty performance, 
you can't make them feel love, 
hate, horror . . . You can't Gestalt 
them unless you put authentic detail on the Passion tape." 

Quinn, lithe and enthusiastic, 
waved his hands creatively. "Too 
many producers think that Pantys are a three-dimensional medium . . . sight, sound & sensation. To me, Pantys are four dimensional and my fourth dimension is realism. Every prop, every 
costume, every bit of cloth, metal, 
china, plastic and so on in my 
productions is authentic. And the 
public feels it. Here, look at this 

The brilliant young producer 
showed us a glittering bit of steel. 
"You won't recognize it," he 
smiled, "until you've seen Murder's Memory Bank. This is the 



S 




 



only one of its kind in existence, 
A rare French folding pistol. 
Watch." 

He pressed the gadget. There 
Was a vicious click. The steel unfolded like a flower. A stiletto 
point appeared, an explosive muzzle, and four heavy steel rings 
which, Quinn explained, were 
knuckledusters. 

"A fistful of murder," Flaton 
said enthusiastically. "Wait until 
you're in your seat at the preview. You feel the knife. You 
feet the bullet tear into your 
heart. You feel all the pain and 
horror of peril and passion. If a 
sensational. It's all in my new 
Panty, Murder's Memory Bank." 

Platon Quinn refolded the pistol, replaced it in the desk and 
forgot it. He forgot it when he 
left the hotel. It remained forgotten until it was used by The 
Demolished Man. 

* * * 

A NTI-Gravity or Nulgee was 
explored, developed and exploited. It smashed one industrial 
world and created five others. 
Among « million entrepreneurs 
scrabbling Phoenixlike in the 
ruins, it was adopted by "The 7 
Sacrament Brothers,", a singletruck moving firm owned and operated by a lone brother named 
Reich. Reich was a thin young 
man, equipped with a fishy eye, 
cannibal ambitions and a minimum of social responsibility. 



Nulgee was also adopted by; 
Space Clubs, Inc., who were having difficulty raising funds. Industry shrugged, preferring to 
leave the wild pioneering to 
fools. Who wants to speculate on 
probabilities? What commercial 
advantage can there be in reaching the arid Moon or the icy methanated planets? Who sponsored 
Cayley, Henson, Stringfellow, 
Chanute, Santos- Dumont, the 
Wrights? Also, there were stvunl 
wars pending, and the armies 
were fighting to stifle Nulgee for 
insecure reasons of security. 

Meanwhile, there was Alnn 
Courtney. After divorcing his 
twelfth wife, Courtney started 
looking around for a new kind of 
hyper-thyroid release. He had 
enough money to bore him. and 
that was enough to start building 
a starship. His statement to the 
press announced that he was off 
to search the stars for an ideal 
wife. The press was indifferent to 
Mr. Courtney and he was piqued. 
Out of spite he finished the ship, 
and out of drunkenness he took 
off. 

He never returned. No one believed he'd left. Five years later, 
most people were asking: "What 
ever happened to marrying Alan 
Courtney ?" And people were answering: "He's living in Santa Fe, 
isn't he? Married again, probably" 

There was also Glen Tuttle, a 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



renegade psychotic who fleeced 
his wife and in-laws, bilked his 
creditors, defrauded his friends, 
and, in a final attempt to jump 
out of the frying pan, constructed 
a flimsy starship on credit and 
lofted to space unknown. Tuttle 
also never returned. His escape 
was never believed. Space Clubs 
was still talking about funds for 
the first ship to carry men to the 
Moon. 

There were, in addition, Almedo Zigerra, Joan Turnbul, 
Fritz Wonchalk. Speeman Van 
Tueik and a few others . . . maladjusted, incapable of social compromise, escapists all . . . which 
is to say, pioneers all. They left 
Earth one by one with varying 
publicity, little recognition, and 
never returned. Space Clubs Inc. 
cheered the donation of $100,000 
by a transportation magnate 
named Reich, and predicted that 
man would soon leave -Earth for 
his first journey into space. It had 
already taken place. It had already produced The Demolished 
Man. 

SHE came through the door 
into the quiet consultation 
room and looked around. She was 
a drab woman, forty, faded, 
frightened. She saw the man behind the desk, a young man with 
black hair, black eyes, and Duffy's white satin skin. 

"Come in, madam. Be seated." 



His voice was low, slightly harsh, 
as though it contained conflicts 
under compression. 

"Thank you." She lowered herself painfully. "Looks too slick. 
Thief-type. Mannerly said the 
guy might be legitimate. Not a 
chance. My recorder on? Right." 

"Your name, madam?" 

"My name? Rhoda Rennsaeler, 
buster, when you read it in the 
byline. I'm Mrs. Thomas Nolles. 
Elvira is my given name." 

"And your problem, Mrs. 
Nolles?" 

"Well, I keep hearing those 
voices in my ear all the time talking to me. So I thought a doctor 
could — '* 

"I'm not a doctor, madam. Understand that. I do not practice 
medicine. I merely advise my 
friends. You may call call me 
mister. Mr. Lorry Gart." 

"Cautious, aren't you? But I'll 
get you, buster, don't ever imagine I won't." 

"Your problem, Mrs. Nolles?" 
Gart repeated. 

"It's these voices. I hear them 
telling me I'm God. And if you 
can resist that come-on, you're a 
smarter crook than I think. I can 
pay for the treatment. I've got a 
roll of bills you'll drool for, you 
cheap quack." 

"Provided by Mr. Hannerly?" 

"Oh, no. It's my savings. I — " 
She stopped short. 

Gart nodded and smiled. "Be

ginning to understand, Mrs. 
Rennsaeler?" 

"/ never said it. Never!" 

"No, of course you didn't. Nor 
your name. You do understand, 
don't you? Now let's be practical, 
Mrs. Rennsaeler. I'm not a 
quack. You won't expose me. 
You'll forget all about this episode." 

"But what in God's name are 
you?" 

"A mind-reader . . . telepath 
. . . esper. I have Extra Sensory 
Perception, Mrs. Rennsaeler — 
ESP. I still haven't decided what 
to call myself." He looked at her 
quizzically.'* "I'd welcome a suggestion from an experienced reporter." 

"The louse! Reading everything in my mind. Stop thinking! 
Why can't I stop thinking? l -He's 
listening. Like a Peeping Tom. 
Peeping. He — " , 

"Mrs. Rennsaeler, stop that!" 
Gart spoke sharply. He arose 
from his chair and stepped 
around the desk to her. "Listen 
to me. Don't be afraid. You feel 
the privacy of your shame is 
being invaded. That makes you 
hostile. But you have nothing to 
be ashamed of, Mrs. Rennsaeler. 
We're all alike inside our minds. 
All of us. I know. I've found that 
out." 

She stared up at him in terror. 
"Believe me." He nodded and 
grinned painfully. "Shall I tell 



you my shames, my secret fears 
and vices, my terrors? Shall we 
be brothers below the conscious 
threshold? My father was a criminal . . . Galen Gart Jr., a telepathic blackmailer, a cheat, a 
man who read min3s to destroy 
people. He was murdered. I have 
in me the same extra sense, the 
ability to read minds . . . not 
deeply, but deeply enough. It's an 
ability tempted by greed, vicious 
hatred of society, compulsions to 
shock and destroy people . . • 
compulsions to destroy myself." 

"I don't understand." She 
shook her head. "I don't understand at all." 

"I'm stripping myself psychologically naked for you, Mrs. 
Rennsaeler. It's my defense 
against your hostility. I'm hoping 
that you can help me become 
something more than a backstreet 
conjurer. You're experienced in 
public relations." 

"No," she said. "No. I came 
here to expose a quack. I — " 

"Listen to me. I use my ability 
to help confused people. They 
come to me . . . the poor sick 
ones ... so sick they can't discover their problems. I do only 
one thing for them. I help them 
recognize their problems. While 
they talk, I listen to their broken 
thoughts. While they wander and 
flounder in confusion, I pick out 
the pieces, the artifacts ... I 
tell them what their crisis is. I

n 



make them see it. I wrap up their 
problem in a neat parcel and 
place it in their hands. They can 
carry it to the nearest analyst 
for solution, though that's generally not necessary." 

"Then you're no quack." 

"No, Mrs. Rennsaeler, I'm not. 
And you believe me. That much 
I can read in your mind. You 
believe me and you want to help 
me. Isn't that true?" 

After a long pause she said: 
"Yes, you damned peeper. I believe you and I want to help 
you." 

Gart took her hand. "You've 
started helping me already. 
You've given me my name."

The Geoffrey Reich, first 
manned ship to reach the Moon, 
discovered Glen Tuttle's ship and 
body in the center of a seventymile bed of Haines' Stellite valued at $6.83 a pound. The airlock 
of Tuttle's ship was open and the 
body sprawled at the entrance. 
Poor Tuttle was so ignorant that 
he never knew the Moon was airless. He had had time for one 
quick glance at Mare Imbrium 
before he suffocated. His body 
was riddled with machine-gun 
perforations from the meteoric 
pellets that bombard the unprotected Moon at 30 miles per second.

MR, ASJ: Counsel may cross


examine the witness. 

MR. LECKY: If it please the 
court, at this time I would like 
to introduce Dr. Walter Clark 
E.M.D., as Esper Medical Expert to conduct the cross-examination of this hostile witness. 

MR. ASJ: Objection. 

THE'.COURT: What is your argument, Mr. Lecky? 

MR. LECKY: I submit, your 
honor, that in this Matter of 
the Estate of Alan Courtney, a 
sum exceeding twenty-five million dollars is at stake. Although I do not impugn the 
conscious honesty of my opponent's witnesses, I suggest that 
their recollection has been colored by dollar signs. 

MR. ASJ: Is counsel making an 
argument or writing a Panty 
scenario? 

MR. LECKY: It is an established fact that men remember 
what they want to remember, 
and forget what they want to 
forget. They do this in all sincerity. Objective truth does not 
exist in the psychoanalytic 
sense, and our courts have affirmed and reaffirmed the psychoanalytic principle in a long 
line of cases. 

THE COURT : This court is acquainted with the precedents, 
Mr. Lecky, but the present 
cause of action does not lie 
with them. 

MR. ASJ: There never yet hat

been a case where a peeper was 
admitted to give evidence, and 
if counsel imagines he's going 
to ring in a — 

MR. LECKY: What are you 
afraid of? If your witnesses are 
telling the truth, my man will 
peep them and confirm it. But 
if they're lying as I suggest— 

THE COURT: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Such exchanges cannot 
be countenanced. The court is 
cognizant of the fact that 
Extra Sensory Experts perform 
valuable services for society in 
many walks of life . . . the 
Esper Medical Doctor, the 
Esper Attorney, the Esper Educator, the Esper Criminologist ... to mention only a few; 
yet the Esper Expert cannot 
properly be admitted to any 
court to give Esper evidence for 
the record. 

MR. LECKY: It cannot be ruled 
an invasion of privacy, your 
honor, any more than a snapshot of a nude sunbather can 
be ruled an invasion of modesty. Three hundred years ago 
the human body was imagined 
to be a thing of shame. Concealment was the strange custom of the day. Two hundred 
years ago, the human mind was 
imagined to be a thing of 
shame. Concealment was the 
strange custom of that time. 
But we have progressed far beyond such medieval concepts


THE COURT: Very true. Mr. 
Lecky, but human justice has 
not yet abandoned the established principle that a man 
cannot be used as a hostile 
witness against himself. A man 
cannot be forced to convict 
himself of subconscious mendacity. Justice must always remain on the objective level. If 
it does not, what would become 
of the deluded innocents who 
falsely believe in their own 
guilt? How would the courts 
reconcile their subjective confessions with their objective 
• innocence? The Objection is 
sustained.

TN 2300, the Sacrament III 
-1 carefully quartering the East 
Quadrant of Mars for FO (fissionable ore) discovered the remains of" marrying Alan Courtney. He had survived his landing 
some two years, eking out his 
dwindling supplies with lichens 
and the dew that formed on the 
surface of his starship. There 
were scars and rust particles on 
his tongue. 

Evidently he had gone insane, 
for they found his dessicated 
body genuflected before a rock 
on which the symbol of the Order 
of Python had been cut. 

The symbol, a serpent coiled 
in an infinity sign, was ignored 
in the reports, but they named a 
city after him.

for one spectator. Silent. Staring. 
Leering. Looming. 

The Man With No Face! 

This time his scream had 
sound. 

Ben Reich awoke. 

He lay quietly in the hydropathic bed while his heart shuddered and his eyes focused at random on objects in the room. The 
walls of green jade, the nightlight in the porcelain mandarin 
whose head nodded interminabty 
if you touched him, the multiclock that radiated the time of 
three planets and nine satellites, 
the bed itself, a crystal pool flowing with carbonated glycerine at 
Speegee three and ninety-nine 
point nine Fahrenheit. 

The door opened softly and 
Jonas appeared in the gloom, a 
shadow in puce sleeping suit, a 
shade with the face of a horse 
and the bearing of an undertaker. 

"Again?" Reich asked. 

"Yes, Mr. Reich." 

"Loud?" 

"Very loud, sir. And terrified." 

"Damn your jackass ears," 
Reich growled. "I'm never 
afraid." 

"No, sir." 

"Get out." 

"Yes, sir. Good night, sir." 
Jonas stepped back and closed 
the door. 

Reich shouted: "Jonast" 

The valet reappeared. 

"Sorry, Jonas." 



"Quite all right, sir." 

"It isn't all right." Reich 
charmed him with a smile. "Next 
time I yell at you, yell right back. 
Why should I have all the fun?" 

"Oh, Mr. Reich . . ." 

"Do that and you get a raise." 
The smile again. "That's all, 
Jonas. Thank you." 

"Thank you, sir." The valet 
withdrew. 

Reich arose from the bed and 
toweled himself before the cheval 
mirror, practicing the smile. 
"Make your enemies by choice," 
he muttered, "not by accident." 
He stared at the reflection: the 
heavy shoulders, deep chest, narrow flanks, long corded legs . . . 
the sleek head with wide eyes, 
small chiseled nose, small sensitive mouth scarred by implacability. 

"Why?" he asked. "I- wouldn't 
change looks with the devil. I 
wouldn't change places with God. 
Why the screaming?" 

He put on a gown and glanced 
at the clock. It was a little after 
six. He would give himself an 
hour of analysis. The screaming 
had to stop. 

"But I'm not afraid," he said. 
"I'm never afraid." 

He stepped down a corridor, 
clacking his sandals sharply on 
the silver floor, indifferent to the 
slumber of his staff, unaware 
that this early morning skeletal 
clatter awakened twelve hearts to 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



IS 



hatred and dread. He thrust open 
the door of his analyst's suite, entered and at once lay down on 
the couch. 

Wilson Breen, E.M.D.2, was already awake and ready for him. 
As Reich's staff analyst he slept 
the 'nurse's sleep' in which he remained en rapport with his patient and e-ould instantly be 
awakened by his needs. That one 
scream had been enough for 
Breen. Now he was seated alongside the couch, elegant in embroidered gown and sharply alert, 
for his employer was generous 
but -demanding. 

"Go ahead, Mr. Reich."

"Nightmares?"

shouted. "I'm not afraid. I'm

realizing the futility of ranting 
while the deft mind of the peeper 
searched underneath his aggressive words. "You're wrong, anyway," he said sulkily, "i don't

"Sears - pits - balcony - boxes staffs - horse stalls - Martian

"And there you have it, Mr. 
Reich. In the past six months 
you've had ninety -seven nightmares about The Man With No

enemy, frustratcr and inspirer of 
terror in dreams that contain 
three common denominators . . . 
Finance, Transportation, and 
Mars. Over and over again . . . 
The Man With No Face, and 
Finance, Transportation and 
Mars." 

"That doesn't mean anything 
to me.'* 

"It must mean something, Mr. 
Reich. You must be able to identify this terrifying figure. Why 
else would you attempt to escape 
by rejecting his face?" 

"I'm not rejecting anything." 

"I offer as further clues the altered word 'dort* and the forgotten name of the company that 
coined the advertising slogan 'We 



Transport You Into—"* 

"I tell you I don't know who 
it is." Reich arose abruptly from 
the couch. "Your clues don't 
help. I can't make any identification." 

"The Man With No Face does 
not fill you with fear because he's 
faceless. You know who he is. 
You hate him and fear him, but 
you know who he is." 

"You're the peeper, damn you! 
You tell me!" 

"There's a limit to my ability, 
Mr. Reich. I can read your mind 
no deeper without help." 

"What do you mean, help? 
You're the best man I could hire. 
If—" 

"Mr. Reich, you deliberately 
hired a 2nd Class Esper in order 
to protect yourself in such an 
emergency. Now you're paying 
the price of your caution, If you 
want the screaming to stop, you'll 
have to consult one of the 1st 
Class men— Augustus T8 or Gart 
or Samuel @kins . . 

"I'll think about it," Reich 
muttered and turned to go. As he 
opened the door, Breen called : 
"By the way. 'We Transport You 
Into Transports' is the slogan of 
the D'Courtney Cartel. How does 
that tie in with the alteration of 
'bort* to 'dort'? Think it over." 

"The Man With No Face!" 

Without staggering, Reich 
slammed the door across the path 
from his mind to Breen and then

lurched down the corridor toward 
his own suite. A wave of savage* 
hatred burst over him. 

"Craye D'Courtney. Tim Man 
With No Face. He's right, the 
smart son of a bitch. It's 
D'Courtney who's giving me the 
screams. Not because I'm afraid 
of him. I'm afraid of myself. 
Known all along. Known it deep 
down inside. Known that once I 
faced it I'd have to kill D'Courtney. He has no face because it's 
the face of murder." 

FT'ULLY dressed and in his 
wrong mind, Reich stormed 
i'u of his apartment and descended to the street where a Sacrament Jumper picked "him up 
and carried him in one graceful 
hop to the giant tower that 
housed the hundreds of floors and 
thousands of employees of Sacrament's New York office. 

Sacrament Tower was the central nervous system of an incredibly vast corporation, a pyramid of transportation, communication, heavy industry, manufacture, sales distribution, research, 
exploration, importation. Sacrament bought and sold, made and 
destroyed, traded and gave. Its 
pattern of subsidiaries and holding companies was so complex 
that it demanded the full-time 
services of a 2nd Class Espcr Accountant. 

ReicVi entered his office, fol


lowed by his chief (Esper 3) secretary and her staff, bearing the 
litter of the morning's work. 
"Dump it and jet," he ordered 

surlily. 

They deposited the papers and 
recording crystals on his desk and 
departed hastily but without rancor. They were accustomed to his 
rages. Reich seated himself behind his desk, trembling with a 
fury that was already goring 
D'Courtney. Finally he muttered : "1*11 give the bastard one 
more chance." 

He unlocked his desk, opened 
the drawer-safe and withdrew the 
Executive's Code Book, restricted 
to the executive heads of the firms 
listed quadruple A-1-* by 
Lloyd's, He found most of the 
material he required in the middle pages of the book:

Marking his place in the code

and said to the image of the

inter-office operator: "Get me 
Code." 

The screen dazzled and cut to 
a smoky room cluttered with 
books and coils of tape. A 
bleached man in a faded shirt 
glanced at the screen, then leaped 
to attention. 

"Yes, Mr. Reich?" 

"Morning, Hassop. You look 
like you need a vacation. Make 
your enemies by choice. Take a 
week at Ampro. Sacrament expense." 

"Thank you. Mr. Reich. Thank 
you very much." 

"This message is confidential.

Code Book. "Send YYJI TTED

Get the answer to me like rockets." 

"Right, Mr. Reich. VU jet." 

Reich cut off the phone. He 
jabbed his hand once into the pile 
of papers and crystals on his 
fesk, picked up a crystal and 
dropped it into the playback. His 
chief secretary's voice said: "Sacrament Gross off two point one 
one three four per cent. D'Courtney Gross up two point one one 
three oh per cent . . .*' 

"Out of my pocket into his!" 
He snapped off the playback and 
arose in an agony of impatience. 
It would take hours for the reply 
to reach Mars and return. His 



whole life hung on D'Courtney*! 
reply. 

He left his office and began to 
roam through the floors and departments of Sacrament Tower, 
pretending the remorseless personal supervision he usually exercised. His *hief secretary unobtrusively accompanied him like 
a trained dog. 

"Trained bitch!" Reich thought. 
Then, aloud: "I'm sorry. Did you 
peep that?" 

"Quite all right, Mr. Reich, I 
understand." 

"Do you? I don't. God dama 
D'Courtney!" 

In Personnel they were testing, 
checking and screening the usual 
mass of job applicants . . . clerks, 
craftsmen, specialists, middle"bracket executives, top drawer 
experts. All the preliminary elimination was done with standardized tests and interviews, and 
never to the satisfaction of Sacraments Esper Personnel chief, who 
was stalking through the floor in 
an icy rage when Reich entered. 
The fact that Reich's secretary 
sent an advance telepathic announcement of the visit made no 
difference to him. 

"I have allotted ten minutes 
per applicant for my final screening interview," the chief was 
snapping to his worried crew. 
"Six per hour. Forty-eight per 
day. Unless my percentage of 
final rejections drops below thir

ty-five, I am wasting my time; 
which means that you are wasting Sacrament's time. I am not 
employed by Sacrament to screen 
out the obviously unsuitable. 
That is your work. See to it." He 
turned to Reich and nodded pedantically. "Good morning, Mr. 
Reich." 

"Morning. Trouble?" 

"Nothing that cannot be handled once this staff understands 
that Extra Sensory Perception is 
not a miracle but a skill subject 
to wage-hour requirements. What 
is your decision on Blogg, Mr. 
Reich?" 

Secretary : "He hasri t read 
your memo yet." 

"May I point out, madam, that 
unless I am used with maximum 
efficiency, I am wasted. The 
Blogg memo has been on Mr. 
Reich's desk for three days." 

"Tel! him about it now." 

"It will consume three minutes 
which will cost my department 
fifteen hundred dollars. My time 
is rated at — " 

"Tell him anyway. He's in a 
temper." 

"Who the hell is Blogg?" 
Reich asked. 

"First, the background, Mr. 
Reich: There are approximately 
one hundred thousand 3rd Class 
Espers in the Esper Guild. An 
Esper 3 can peep the conscious 
level of a mind. The 3rd can discover what a subject is thinking 



at the moment of thought. The 
3rd is the lowest class of telepaths. Most of Sacrament's security positions are held by 3rds. 
We employ over five hundred . . .** 

"For God's sake, he knows ail 
this. Everybody does. Get to the 
point, long-winded!" 

"Permit me to arrive at the 
point in my own way, madam." 

"How did you ever get into 
Personnel, gas-bag? You're m 
born bad lecture/." 

"There are approximately ten 
thousand 2nd Class Espers in the 
Guild," the Personnel chief continued frostily. "They are experts 
like myself who can penetrate 
beneath the conscious level of the 
mind to the preconscious. Moat 
2nds are in the professional class 
. . . physicians, lawyers, engineers, educators, economists, architects and so on." 

"And you cost a fortune," 
Reich growled. 

"We have unique service to 
sell. Sacrament appreciates that 
fact. Sacrament employs over one 
hundred 2nds at present." 

"Will you get to the point? If 
he wasn't so mad at D'Courtney, 
he'd have your head off by now." 

"There are less than a thousand 1 st Class Espers in the 
Guild. The lsts are capable of 
deep peeping, through the conscious and preconscious layers 
down to the unconscious, the lowest levels of the mind. Primordial

basic desires and so forth. These 
Espers, of course, hold premium 
positions. Education, specialized 
medical service . . . analysts like 
T8. Gart, @kins. Moselle . . . 
criminologists like Preston Powell of the Psychotic Division . . . 
Political Analysts, State Negotiators, Special Cabinet Advisers 
and so on. Thus far Sacrament 
has never had occasion to hire a 
1st." 

"And?" Reich demanded. 

"The occasion has arisen, Mr. 
Reich, and I believe Blogg may 
be available. Briefly . . ." 

"/( says here." 

"Briefly, Sacrament is hiring 
so many Espers that I have suggested we set up a special Esper 
Personnel Department", headed 
by a 1st like Blogg to devote 
itself exclusively to the work." 

"He's wondering why you can't 
handle it." 

"I have given you the background to explain why I cannot 
handle the job, Mr. Reich. I am 
a 2nd Class Esper. I can telepath normal applicants rapidly 
and efficiently, but I cannot handle other Espers with the same 
speed and efficiency. All Espers 
are accustomed to using mind 
blocks of varying effectiveness 
depending on their rating. It 
would take me one hour per 3rd 
for an efficient screening interview. It would take me three 
hours per 2nd. I could not pos


sibly peep a 1st. We must hire a 
1st like Blogg for this work. The 
cost will be large, but the necessity is urgent.* 

"What's so urgent?" Reich said. 

"For God's sake, don't give him 
that picture.' He's sore enough 
about D' Courtney ." 

"I have my job to do, madam." 
To Reich, the chief said: "We are 
not hiring the best Espers, Mr. 
Reich. The D'Courtney Cartel 
has been taking the cream of the 
Espers away from us. Over and 
over again, through lack of proper facilities, we have been tricked 
by D'Courtney into bidding for 
inferior people while D'Courtney 
has quietly appropriated the 
best." 

"God damn you!" Reich 
shout v-d. "God damn D'Courtney. All right, set it up. And tell 
this Blogg to start mouse -trapping D'Courtney. You'd better 
start, too." 

He left Personnel and went 
down to Sales, where a copycheck was being run on an audience of one hundred people 
selected at random from the 
streets. They were seated in the 
small theater, watching a test 
run of advertising copy, while the 
Esper Sales chief peeped their 
reactions and responses. Warned 
by Reich's secretary, he dropped 
his work at once and came up to 
Reich, his face perplexed and annoyed. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Morning, Mr. Reich.* 1 
^ "Morning. Trouble?" 

"Save it. Save it. Don't spill 
anything" 

"Got to, girlie. It's a crisis." 

"Bub, you only think it's a 
crisis. The boss is — " 

"I wish you could peep that 
audience, Mr. Reich. How does 
D'Courtney do it?" 

"Do what?" 

"Build that hostility toward 
us." The Sales chief waved at the 
people in the chairs. "They think 
all our products are shoddy substitutes for D'Courtney's. They 
think every bit of our copy is an 
outrageous lie. That damned 
Cartel's instilled patriotism ! 
They feel it'd be an act of treachery to settle for anything less 
than D'Courtney." 

"Who's handling their Public 
Relations? Whoever if. is, get 
him." 

"He's a she, Mr. Reich," the 
secretary said. "An Esper 2. And 
incorruptible." 

"Who said anything about corruption ?" 

"You didn't say it, Mr. Reich, 
but we tried." 

"I'll fix him!" Reich shouted. 

He stormed up to Propaganda, 
where the department chief was 
rapidly peeping a battery of fieldresearchers, all 3rds, all back 
from Continental Africa, and all 
- apparently with discouraging 
news.

"Morning," Reich interrupted. 
"Trouble?" 

The Propaganda chief ignored 
the secretary's warning and 
nodded dismally. "Let's face it," 
he said. "We're being licked." 
"D'Courtney?" 

"D'Courtney. You name any 
place on any planet or satellite, 
and that's where D'Courtney's 
the Great White Father. If Sacrament tried to give anything 
away, they'd refuse to accept." 

"We're -dropping all campaigns 
as of now. Never mind whitewashing Sacrament. Start mudslinging D'Courtney. I want 
smear. Attack him. Villify him. 
He robs banks. He rapes widoi 
He cheats orphans. He — " 

"Got your picture," the pee 
interrupted. "What about sla 
der?" 

"Who gives a damn for th 
law? Let him sue. He'll 
smeared by the time he gets 
court. Pass the word for Legal 
meet in my office." 

Reich returned to his offi" 
where the Legal chief, forewarned 
by the lightning telepathic grapevine, was already waiting with 
Reich's picture in his mind. 

"You can't do it, Mr. Reich," 
he said. "D'Courtney'll sue and 
collect." 

"One way or another, D'Courtney'll bust Sacrament wide Open 
if we don't fight. Go peep Accounting for the picture." 


 



"I've got the picture from you, 
nr." 

"Then get back to your department and start preparing a defense. Propaganda's going to start 
a full campaign . . , whisper, 
©vert, blatant. I'm using an old 
fighting trick. If you can't attack 
the argument, attack the man. I 
want D'Courtney attacked, legally and illegally. You're forewarned. We're going to break a 
few laws . . .'* 

"A few hundred." 

"All right. Hit D'Courtney 
with suits before he hits us. Accuse him of everything we're going to do to him. Start every civil 
and criminal action against him 
that we'll be guilty of. This is a 
fight for survival. Pass the word 
and get the hell out of here." 

After the Legal chief was gone, 
Reich paced in a fury for five 
minutes. "It's no use," he muttered. "I know I'll have to kill 
the bastard. He won't accept. 
Why should he accept? He thinks 
he's licked me. Damn him, he has 
licked me. All this is just loud 
talk. I'll have to kill him. And 
I'll need some real help . . . peeper 
help." 

He flipped on the phone and 
told the operator: 
"Relations." 

A sparkling lounge appeared 
on the screen, decorated in 
chrome and enamel, equipped 
with game tables and a bar dis


penser. It appeared to be and 
was used as a recreation center. 
It was, in fact, headquarters of 
Sacrament's powerful espionage 
division. The Recreation director, 
a bearded scholar named West, 
looked up from a chess problem, 
then leaped to attention. 

"Good morning, Mr. Reich." 

Warned by the formal 'Mister' 
Reich said: "Good morning, Mr. 
West. Just a routine check. Paternalism, you know. How's 
amusement these days?" 

"Modulated, Mr. Reich. However, I must complain. I think 
there's entirely too much gambling going on." West stalled in 
a fussy voice until two bona fide 
Sacrament clerks innocently finished their drinks and departed. 
Then he relaxed and slumped 
into his chair. "All clear, Ben. 
Shoot." 

"Has Hassop broken the confidential code yet, Ellery?" 

THE peeper shook his head 
bitterly, 
"Trying?" 

West smiled and nodded. 
"Where's D'Courtney?" 
"En route to Terra, aboard the 
Astra." 

"Know his plans? Where he'll 
be staying?" 

"No. Want a check?" 

"I don't know. It depends . . .** 

"Depends on what?" West 
glanced at him curiously. "I wish

the Telepathic Pattern could be 
transmitted by phone, Ben. I'd 
like to know what you're driving 
at." 

Reich smiled grimly. "Thank 
God for the phone. It protects us 
from TP invasion. What's your 
personal attitude toward crime, 
Ellery?" 

"Typical." 

"Of anybody?" 

"Of the Esper Guild. The 
Guild doesn't like it, Ben." 

"You're a sharp character, 
Ellery. You know the value of 
money, success. Why don't you 
clever up? Why do you let the 
Guild do your thinking?" 

"You don't understand. We're 
born in the Guild. We live with 
the Guild. We die in the Guild. 
We have the right to elect Guild 
officers, and that's all. The Guild 
runs our professional lives. It 
trains us, grades us, sets ethical 
standards and sees that we stick 
to them. It protects us by protesting the layman. Same as medical associations. We have the 
equivalent of the Hippocratic 
Oath. It's called the Galen 
Pledge. God help any of us if 
we break it ... as I judge you're 
suggesting I should." 

"Maybe I am," Reich said intently. "Maybe I'm hinting it 
could be worth your while to 
break the Guild pledge. Maybe 
I'm thinking in terms of money 
* . . more than you or any 2nd 



Class peeper would see in a lifetime." 

"Forget it, Ben. Not interested." 

"So bust your pledge. What 
happens?" 

"We're ostracized." 

"Smart peepers have broken 
with the Guild before. They've 
been ostracized. What of it?" 

WEST smiled wryly. "You 
wouldn't understand, Ben." 
"Make me understand." 
"Those peepers you mention, 
like Jeremy Church. They weren't 
so smart. It's like this . . ." West 
considered. "Before surgery really 
got started, there used to be a 
handicapped group called deafmutes." 

"No-hear no-talk?" 
"That's it. They communicated 
by a manual sign language. That 
meant they couldn't communicate with anybody but deafmutes. Understand? They had to 
live in their own community or 
they couldn't live at all. A man 
goes crazy if he can't have 
friends." 
"So?" 

"Some of them started a racket. They'd tax the more successful deaf-mutes for weekly handouts. If the victim refused to pay, 
they'd ostracize him. The victim 
always paid. It was a choice of 
paying or living in solitary until 
he went mad." 




 



"You mean you peepers are 
like deaf-mutes?" 

"No, Ben. You non-Espers are 
the deaf-mutes. If we had to live 
with you alone, we'd go mad. 
Now for God's sake, leave me 
alone. I've got work to do. If 
you're planning something dirty, 
I don't want to know." 

West cut off the phone in 
Reich's face. With a roar of rage, 
Reich snatched up a gold paperweight and hurled it into the 
crystal screen. Before the shattered fragments finished flying, 
he slammed the door of his office 
and was on his way out of the 
building. 

TTiS secretary knew where he 
was going. His peeper chauffeur knew 'where he wanted to 
go. Reich arrived in his apartment and was met by his peeper 
house -supervisor, who at once announced early luncheon and 
tuned the meal to Reich's unspoken demands. Feeling slightly 
less violent, Reich stalked into 
his study and turned to his safe, 
which was a mere shimmer of 
light in the corner. 

It was simply a honeycomb 
paper rack tuned out of temporal 
phase with a single-cycle beat. 
Once a second, when the safe 
phase and temporal phase coincided, the rack pulsed with a 
brilliant glow. The safe could be 
•witched back into full temporal 



phase only by the pore-pattern 
of Reich's right index finger, 
which was irreproduceable. 

Reich placed the tip of his 
finger in the center of the glow. 
It faded and the honeycomb rack 
appeared. Holding his finger in 
place, he reached up and took 
down a small black notebook and 
a large red envelope clearly lettered; TO BE OPENED IN CASE OF 
MURDER. 

He removed his index finger 
and the safe pulsed out of temporal phase again. 

Reich flipped through the 
pages of the notebook . . . abduction . . . ABORTION . . . ANARCHISTS . . . ARSONISTS . . . BRIBERY 
AND CORRUPTION (ALREADY) . , . 
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION (POSSIBLE) . . . Under possible, he 
found the names of fifty-seven 
prominent people. One of them 
was Augustus T8, Esper Medical 
Doctor I. He nodded with satisfaction. 

He tore open the red envelope 
and examined^ its contents. It 
contained five sheets of closely 
written pages in a handwriting 
that was centuries old. Four of 
the pages were lettered: plan A, 

PLAN B, PLAN C, PLAN D. The fifth 

was headed introduction. Reich 
read the ancient spidery script 
slowly : 

To those who come after me: 

The test of intellect is the refusal

to belabor the obvious. If you have 
opened this letter, we already understand each other. 1 have prepared four 
general murder plans which may help 
you. I bequeath them to you as part 
of the Reich inheritance. They are only 
outlines. The detail., must be tilled in 
by yourself as your time and necessity 
require 

But remember this: The essence of 
murder never changes. It is always 
the conflict of the killer against society 
with the victim as the prize. And tbo 
ABC of conflict with society never 
changes. Be audacious, be brave, he 
confident and you will not fail. Against 
these qualities society has no defense. 

Geoffrey Reich 

Reich leafed through the plans 
slowly, speculatively, filled with 
admiration for the great old pirate who had had the forethought 
and ingenuity to perform this 
work for his descendants. His 
imagination kindled and ideas 
began forming and crystalizing to 
be considered, discarded and instantly replaced. 



OAIAXY SCI IN CI FICTION 



One remarkable phrase caught 
his attention : If you are a natural 
killer, don't plan too carefully. 
Leave most to your instinct. Intellect may fail you, but the killer's instinct is infallible. 

"The killer's instinct," Reich 
breathed. "By God, I've got 
that." 

The phone chimed once and 
then the automatic switched on. 
There was a quick chatter and 
tape began to stutter out of the 
recorder. Reich strode to the desk 
and examined it. 

The message was very short 
»nd very deadly: 

CODE TO REICH: REPLY WWHG. 

"Offer refused. I knew it. I 
knew it!" Reich gritted. "All 
right, D'Courtney. If you won't 
let it be merger, then it's going 
to be murder." 

Ill 

A UGUSTUS T8, E.M.D.l, re•*» ceived $1,000 per hour of 
analysis — not a high fee considering that you rarely required 
more rtian an hour of the doctor's 
devastating time — but it placed 



his income at $8,000 a day, $40,000 a week, or $2 million a year. 
The public knew his income, but 
it did not know what proportion 
of that income was paid into the 
Esper Guild for the education of 
other Espers and the furthering 
of the Guild's long-range eugenic 
plan to bring Extra Sensory Perception to every person in all the 
worlds. 

Augustus T8 knew, and the 
95% he paid was a sore point 
with him. Because of it, he was 
not fully reconciled to the Galen 
Pledge. Almost, but not quite. It 
was the "not quite" that placed 
him in Ben Reich's bribery and 
corruption (possible) category. 

Reich marched into T8's overpowering consultation room, 
glanced once at T8's tiny figure, 
slightly out of proportion, carefully realigned by tailors, then 
sat down and grunted: 

"Peep me quick." 

He glared in concentration at 
T8 while the elegant little peeper 
examined him with a glittering 
eye and spoke in quick staccato 
bursts : 

"You're Ben Reich of Sacrament. Ten billion dollar firm. You 
think I should know you. I do. 



"A 1st Class Esper? Am I 
supposed to believe it? Am I supposed to believe you're incapabte 
of outwitting the whole world?" 

T8 smiled. "Sugar for the fly," 
he said. "A characteristic device 
of—" 

"Peep me," Reich interrupted. 
"It'll save time. Read what's in 
my mind. Your gift. My resources. An unbeatable combination. My God, it's lucky for the 
Solar System I'm willing to stop 
at one murder!" 

"No," T8 said with decision. 
" U r won't do. I'll have to commit 
you, Mr. Reich." 

"Wait. Want to find out why 
that - payment thought was 
cloudy? Read me deeper. How 
much am I willing to pay ? 
What's my top limit?" 

*T18 closed his eyes. His mannequin face tightened painfully. 
Then his eyes opened in surprise. 
"You can't be serious!" he exclaimed. 

"I am," Reich grunted. "And 
what's more, you know it's an 
offer in good faith, don't you?" 

T8 nodded slowly. 

"And you're aware that Sacrament plus D'Courtney can make 
the offer good." 

"I almost believe you." 

"You can believe me. I throw 
my combined resources at your 
disposal. I guarantee to satisfy 
every whim,' every desire, every 



You're involved in a death struggle with the D'Courtney Cartel. 
You're savagely hostile toward 
D'Courtney. Offered merger this 
morning. Offer refused. In desperation you have resolved to — " 
T8 broke off abruptly. 

"Go ahead," Reich said. 

"To murder Craye D'Courtney 
as the first step in taking over his 
cartel. You need my help. You 
offer me — that thought's vague." 

"One million dollars. In secret. 
Tax free. Guild free." 

"Ridiculous." 

"Peep me. What's in my 
pocket?" 

"Five uncut emeralds valued at 
twenty thousand dollars each. If 
you keep on like this. Mr. Reich, 
I'll have to commit you."^ 

"One hundred thousand dollars down payment. Untraceable. 
Yours." 

Reich withdrew the stones 
from his pocket and tossed them 
on the desk, where they rolled 
like cloudy green pebbles. T8 
stared at them. 

"One hundred thousand a week 
for ten weeks. The murder can't 
take any longer. No record. No 
implication. All safe. Still thinking of committing me?" 

"It can't be done," T8 said, 
hungrily not touching the cold 
stones. 

"It can be done with your 
help." 

"I can do nothing to help you."

inclination you may have for the 
rest of your life. Read me. Am I 
sincere? Will I hold to my 
word?" 

"You will," T8 admitted with 
extreme reluctance. 

"Will you accept or commit? 
And don't forget ... I can fight 
a committal. Don't ever imagine 
I can't." 

"The bribe is too big," T8 said, 
his face beginning to strain again. 
"You can't possibly hate D' Courtney with that much ferocity. I'm 
trying to discover why the bribe 
is too big." 

"Don't bother. I'll tell you. 
You want to enjoy the world. I 
want to own the world. So long 
as I own it, I'm willing to let you 
enjoy it." 

T8 picked up the stones and 
fingered them. He closed his eyes 
and said: "There hasn't been a 
successful premeditated murder 
in 79 years. Espers make it impossible to conceal intent before 
the murder. Or, if Espers have 
been evaded before the murder, 
they make it impossible to conceal the guilt." , 

"Esper evidence isn't admitted 
in court." 

'TT1RUE, but once an Esper discovers the guilt he can 
uncover objective evidence to 
support his peeping. Powell, the 
Prefect of the Psychotic Division, is deadly." T8 opened his 



eyes. "Do you want your emeralds back?" 

"No," Reich said. "Look the 
situation over with me first. Murders have always failed because 
no killer had the sense to hire a 
good peeper, or at least, if he 
had the sense, he couldn't afford 
the deal. I can.** 

"Yes, you can." 

"I'm going to fight a war," 
Reich continued. "I'm going to 
fight one sharp skirmish with society. Let's look at it as a problem in strategy and tactics. My 
problem's that of any army. 
Audacity, bravery and confidence 
aren't enough; An army, needs 
Intelligence. A war is won with 
Intelligence. I need you for my 
G-2." 

"Agreed." 

"I'll do the fighting. You'll procure the Intelligence. I'll have to 
know where D'Courtney will be, 
where I can strike, when I can 
strike. I'll take care of the killing 
myself, but you'll have to tell me 
when and where the opportunity 
will be." 

"Understood." 

"I'll have to invade first . . . 
cut through a defensive network 
surrounding D'Courtney. That 
means reconnaissance from you. 
You'll have to run interference, 
check the normals, spot the peepers, warn me and block them if 
I can't avoid them. You'll -have 
to remain on the scene after the

at 



murder. Youll find out whom 
the police suspect and why. If 
I know suspicion is directed 
against myself, I can divert it. If 
I know it's directed against someone else, I can clinch it. I can 
fight this war and win this war 
with your Intelligence. Is that 
the truth? Peep me." 

After a long pause, T8 said: 
"It's the truth. We can do it* 
He picked up the emeralds and 
dropped them into his pocket 
with finality. "There's to be a 
social gathering tonight at Preston Powell's house. D'Courtney's 
physician will be there. I'll start 
the reconnaissance. Maybe I'll 
locate D'Courtney's plans and 
destination for you. I think I 
can." 

"And you're not afraid of the 
deadly Powell'?" 

T8 smiled contemptuously. "If 
I were, Mr. Reich, would I trust 
myself in this bargain with you? 
Make no mistake, I'm ho Jeremy 
Church." 

"Church!" 

"Yes. The Esper 2nd. He was 
kicked out of the Guild ten years 
ago for that little junket of his 
with you." 

"Damn you. Got that from me, 
eh?" 

"You and history." 

"Well, it won't repeat itself this 
time. You're tougher and smarter 
than Church. Need anything special for Powell's party? Women? 



Clothes? Jewels? Money?" 

"Nothing, thank you." 

"Criminal but generous, that's 
me." Reich smiled as he arose to 
go. He did not offer to shake 
hands. 

"Mr. Reich!" T8 called suddenly. 

Reich turned at the door. 

"The screaming will continue. 
The Man With No Face is not a 
symbol of D'Courtney or murder." 

"What? Oh, Christ, the nightmares. Still? How did you get 
that? How did you — H 

"Don't be a fool. Do you think, 
you can play games like that with 
a 1st?" 

"What about the damned 
nightmares?" 

"No, I shan't tell you. I doubt 
if anyone but a 1st can tell you, 
and naturally you would not dare 
to consult another after this conference." 

"For God's sake, man! Are you 
going to help me?" 

"No, Mr. Reich," T8 smiled 
malevolently. "That's my little 
weapon. It keeps us on a parity 
basis. Criminal but peeper . . . 
that's me." 

LIKE all upper grade Espers, 
Preston Powell, Ph.D.l, lived 
in a private house. It was not a 
question of conspicuous consumption, but rather a problem 
of privacy. Life in any multiple

OALAXr SCIENCE FICTION 



dwelling was life in an inferno 
of naked emotion for an Esper, 
especially an Esper 1st. 

Powell occupied a small limestone maisonette on Hudson 
Ramp, overlooking the North 
River. There were only four 
rooms — upstairs, a bedroom and 
study; downstairs, a living room 
and kitchen. The interior walls 
were translucent nacre, at present colored oyster white with 
scounces, mouldings and Adam 
mantles projected on them. The 
polymorph furniture was currently shaped into Sheraton and 
Hepplewhite reproductions. All 
Espers required frequent sensory 
rcstimulation, and he was now 
in his Georgian period. 

There was no servant in the 
house; he preferred to do for himself. He was in the kitchen, checking over the stasis-freeze in preparation for the party, whistling 
a plaintive, crooked tune, a slender man in his late thirties, tall, 
loose, slow-moving. His cropped 
hair was prematurely white; a 
startling contrast to the jet black 
eyebrows and deep dark eyes. His 
nose was _big, thrusting, almost 
arrogant. His wide mouth seemed 
perpetually on the verge of laughter. 

If you looked at the lower half 
of Powell's face, you said this 
must be the funniest man in the 
world. If you looked at the upper 
half, you were sure he was the 



saddest man in the world. If you 
asked him, he would answer that 
he was both or neither or anything, depending on the situation, 
the questioner and the reason for 
the question. 

For it was the essence of the 
Esper that 1 he, too, was polymorph ... a personality of many 
shapes and many quantities. 
There was no consistent public 
character; there was only consistent response to the requirements of all situations. Sensitive 
to the demands of the psyche, 
the Esper gave you the response 
you really wanted and it was this 
responsive quality that made Espers fantastically popular. Layman pursued them endlessly, offering friendship and fraternity, 
marriage and maternity; and the 
Espers fled desperately, unable to 
explain to the deaf-mutes that 
these were unilateral offers . . . 
that there could be no genuine 
relationship between all-giver 
and all-taker . . . that only Espers 
could give to each other with any 
sort of equality.

"I have enough love. Cod pity

"One, God pity us, is not

"You must marry before you're

"I know it." 

"What are you waiting for

"A wife I can love" 

"Let friendship answer. Marry

I'll let you go. I won't cling. I 
won't make you hate me. Darling, it'% so little to ask ... so 
little to give . . ." 

"But you're asking more than 
either of us could give. If we were 
non-Espers, we might make it 
work. But we're not." 

Her hands became tight fists 
pressing against her hips. 

He shook his head. "You see, 
Mary? You're loathing yourself 
ior being an Esper, envying deal


mutes their watery loves." 

"But it I became a 1st . . 

The doorbell chimed. Powell 
looked at Mary helplessly. 
"Guests," he murmured and directed Open in C-sharp at the TP 
lock-senser. At the same instant 
she directed Close a fifth above. 
The harmonics meshed and the 
door remained shut. 

"Answer me first, Pres." 

"I can't give you the answer 
you want, Mary." 

The doorbell chimed again. 

"For God's sake, be honest. Say 
it" 

He took her shoulders firmly, 
held her close and looked deep 
into her eyes. "You're a 2nd. 
Read me as deeply as you can. 
What's in my heart? Whafs in 
my mind?" 

He removed all blocks. The 
thundering, plunging depths of 
his mind cascaded over her in a 
warm, frightening, exalted torrent, terrifying, yet magnetic and 
desirable; but . . . 

"Snow. Mint. Tulips. Taffeta," 
she said wearily. "Co meet your 
guests, Pres. I'll make your canapes. It's all I'm good for." 

He kissed her once, with compassion, then turned toward the 
living room and opened the front 
door. 

Instantly a fountain of telepathic brilliance sparkled into the 
house, followed by the guests. 

The Esper party began.

rpHERE was another burst of 
laughter when Mary Noyes 
was left hanging with that un•eticulated "yet." She blushed 
with embarrassment and fought 
to conceal the wave of shame and 
humiliation linked with Powell's 
rejection that swept up from the 
lower levels of her mind. 

Fortunately, the doorbell 
chimed again, and Alan Seaver 
(Solar Equity Advocate 2) entered with a girl. She was a demure little thing, surprisingly 
attractive outwardly, and new to 
the company. Her Thought Pattern was naive and not deeply 
responsive. Obviously a 3rd. 

"Abject apologies for the delay. 
Orange blossoms &• wedding rings

"1 forgot," she blurted again, 
and then heated the room with 
her fright and shame. While 
Seaver glare d at her, Powell 
stepped forward, took the girl's 
trembling hand and flooded her 
mind with warm acceptance. 

"Ignore him, Helen. He's a 2ndcome-latety snob. I'm Preston

"Sherlock can't pronounce

« A L A X T .SCIENCE FICTION 



"Th-thank — / mean, thank

In one lightning TP broadcast, 
Powell and @kins engaged in 
comedy mental combat for the 
girl's favors, while Seaver served 
them with summonses "and Sally 
rubbed two Boy Scouts together 
to set both rivals on fire and destroy them. The girl giggled and 
began to relax. 

"That fat man sitting on the 
floor is Wally Chervil, labor-two. 
The blonde sitting in his lap is 
June, his wife. June's an editortwo. Thafs their son, Galen, talking to Ellery West. Gally's a 
tech'Undergrad-three , . ,** 

Young Galen Chervil indignantly started to point out that 
he'd just been classed 2nd and 
hadn't needed to use words in 
over a year. Powell cut him off 
below the girl's perceptive threshold and explained the reason for 
the deliberate mistake — he didn't 
want her to feel lost among all 
2nds and Ists. 

"Oh," said Galen, "Yep, brother and sister 3rds, that's us, Miss 
Post. And am I glad you're here! 
These deep peepers were beginning to scare me." 

"I was scared at first, but I'm 
not any more." 

"And this is your hostess, 
Helen. Mary Noyes." 

"Hello, Helen. Canapes?" 

"Thank you. They look delicious, Mrs. Powell." 



"Now how about a game?" 
Powell interposed quickly. "Anybody feel like playing Rebus?" 

TTUDDLED in the shadow of 
the limestone arch, Jeremy 
Church pressed against the garden door of Powell's house, listening with all his soul. He was cold, 
silent, immobile and starved. He 
was resentful, hating, contemptuous and starved. He was an Esper 
Bar 2 and starved. The bar sinister of ostracism was the source 
of his hunger. 

Through the thin maple panel 
filtered the multiple Thought 
Pattern of the party, a weaving, 
ever-changing, exhilarating design. And Church, Esper Bar 2, 
living on a diet of words for the 
past ten years, was starved for 
his real communication. 

"The reason I mentioned 
D'Courtney is that I've just comm 
across a case that might be similar." 

That was T8, sucking up t» 
@kins. 

"Oh, really? Very interesting;, 
I'd like to compare notes. Too 
bad D'Courtney won't — well, fee 
available." @kins was being discreet and it smelled as though 
T8 was after something. Maybe 
not, but there certainly was some 
elegant block and counter- blocking going on, like duelists fencing 
with complicated electrical circuits. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



"Look here, Al, I think you've 
been pretty snotty to that poor 
girl." 

Powell, who'd had him ostracized, preaching down his big 
nose at the lawyer. 

"Poor girl? You wean dumb 
girl, Pres. My God! How gauche 
can you get?" 

"She's only a 3rd, Al. Be fair.**

"Don't be a romantic ass, Pres.

(i What d'you think of Powell

Chervil with his phony smile and 
his pontifical belly. 

"For Guild President?" 

"Yes." 

"Damned efficient man. Romantic but efficient. The perfect 
candidate if he'd only get married." 

"That's the romance in him. 
He's having trouble locating a 
girl." 

"Don't all you deep peepers? 
Thank God I'm not a 1st." 

And then a smash of glass 
crashing in the kitchen and 
Preacher Powell again, lecturing 
little T8. 

"Never mind the glass, Gus. I 
had to drop it to co^er for you. 
You're radiating anxiety like an 
FO star." 

"The hell I am, Powell." 

"The hell you're not. What's 
all this about Ben Reich?" 

The little swine was really terrified. You could feel it blazing 
under the block he quickly 
erected. . 

"Ben Reich? What brought

"You did, Gus. It's been moiling in your preconscious all evening. I couldn't help latching on 
to it"

"Well, take a hint from an old 
hand. Reich can get you into 
trouble. Be careful. Remember 
Jerry Church? Reich ruined him. 
Don't let it happen to you." 

The pigmy skedaddled and 
Preacher Powell remained in the 
kitchen, calm and slow-moving, 
sweeping up broken glass while 
Church lay frozen against the 
back door, suppressing the hatred, 
seething in his heart. The Chervil 
boy was showing off for the lawyer's girl, singing a love ballad 
and paralleling it with a visual 
parody. College stuff. The wives 
were arguing violently in sine 
curves. @kins and West were interlacing cross-conversation in a 
fascinatingly intricate pattern of 
sensory images that made his 
starvation keener. 

"Would you like a drink, 
Jerry?" 

The garden door opened. Powell stood silhouetted in the light, 
a bubbling glass in his hand. The 
stars lit his face softly. The deep 
hooded eyes were compassionate and understanding. Dazed, 
Church climbed to his feet and

"Don't report this to the Guild. 
Vd catch hell for breaking the 
taboo. Poor Jerry . . . We've got 
to do sometliing for you. Ten 
years is too long." 

Church hurled the drink in 
Powell's face, then turned and 
fled, weeping invisible tears of 
anger and self-pity.

AT nine the next morning, T8*s 
mannequin face appeared on 
the screen of Reich's phone. 

"Is this line secure?" he asked 
sharply. 

Reich pointed to the Warranty 
Seal. 

"All right," T8 said. "I think 
V ve done the j ob for you. I 
peeped (S>kins last night. Before I 
report. I must warn you — there's 
a chance of error when you deeppeep a 1st. @kins blocked pretty 
carefully." 

"He would, of course." 

"Craye D' Courtney arrives 
from Mars on the Astra next 
Wednesday morning. He will go 
at once to the home of Maria 
Beaumont, where he will be a 
secret and hidden guest for exactly one night." 

"One night," Reich repeated. 
"And then? His plans?" 

"I don't know. Apparently 
D'Courtney is planning some 
form of drastic action — " 



"Against me!" 

"Perhaps. According to @kins, 
D'Courtney is under some kind 
of violent strain and his adaptation pattern is shattering. The 
Life Instinct and Death Instinct 
have defused. He is regressing 
under the emotional bankruptcy 
very rapidly . . 

"My life depends on this,** 
Reich raged. "Talk straight." 

"Every man is a balance of 
two opposed drives — the Life Instinct and the Death Instinct. 
Both drives have the identical 
purpose, to win Nirvana. The 
Life Instinct fights for Nirvana 
by smashing all opposition. The 
Death Instinct attempts to win 
Nirvana by destroying itself. 
Usually both instincts flW in 
the adapted individual. Under 
strain, they defuse. That's what's 
happening to D'Courtney." 

"Yes. by God! And he's jetting 
for me!" 
v "@kins will see D'Courtney 
Thursday morning in an effort to 
dissuade him from whatever he 
contemplates.* @kins is afraid of 
it and determined to stop it." 

"He won't have to stop it. I'll 
stop it myself. It's self-dt ftnse, 
T8,.not murder! You've done a 
good job." 

"This is Monday. "You'll have 
to be ready by Wednesday." 

"I'll be ready," Reich assured 
him grimly. "You'd better be 
ready too." 




 



"I've reconsidered," T8 said. 
"This is as far as I care to go." 
' "The hell you say." 

"I've given you your essential 
information. Your Intelligence, 
you called it. I've been paid. 
We'll call it quits." 

"Look," Reich said ominously. 
"I can't swing it alone and you 
know it. That was the understanding. I need you to cover for 
me at Maria Beaumont's house 
next Wednesday. I'll need you for 
the cops afterward. I told you it 
was a ten week job. One day for 
the kill and sixty-nine days to 
cover." 

"I'm sorry." T8 said. *'I can't 
do it." 

"You don't know how sorry 
you're going to be," Reich answered. He flipped the Warranty 
Seal and it clattered off the line. 
It was really an astonishing counterfeit, and the mere possession 
of it could make extraordinary 
difficulties if reported to the government. Reich pointed to the recording crystal. '"Want to hear 
the playback?" 

T8's face turned livid. "You 
contemptible fool! You recorded 
this conversation? You — " 

"It'll stay recorded until we've 
finished the job. Then I'll send 
you the crystal and a hammer." 

"If the police ever — it'll mean 
Demolition. Don't you realize 
that?" 

"Demolition for both of us. 



Yes, I realize that." Reich's voice 
began to crack. "You little louse! 
Do you think I'm going to let 
anything stand between me and 
that bastard's blood? Anything?" 
He managed to take hold of himself. "You're in this all the way 
with me, and I'm in it straight 
to the finish . . . one way or the 
other. Don't forget the strain I'm 
under. I'm starting to defuse 
too." 

DEICH planned all that Monday, audaciously, bravely, 
with confidence. He planned as 
a story is plotted or a song is 
sketched. He penciled the outlines 
as an artist fills a sheet with delicate tracery before the bold inking-in; but he did no final inking. 
That was to be left for the- killerinstinct on Wednesday night. He 
put the plan away and slept Monday night . . . and awoke screaming, dreaming of The Man With 
No Fact. 

But Tuesday morning he reexamined the plan and was satisfied. It was audacious, brave, 
confident. One trick to make himself invisible for the attack on 
D'Courtney; one time-machine to 
banish all defense out of the continuum: one ingenious deception 
to rob all peepers of their dangerous telepathic perception; one 
final, inexplicable murderous 
blow to destroy his enemy forever. 



HE DEMOLISHED MAN 



Tuesday afternoon, Reich left 
Sacrament Tower early and 
dropped in at the Winter Studios 
on Sheridan Place. A two-century zigzag progression led from 
the old book store via: pornographic literature — pornographic 
Pantys — legitimate Pantys — industrial Pantys — industrial research — -planetary research — and 
Planetary Conditioning to the 
giant block of buildings where 
would-be colonists were inducted 
and trained for survival in the 
strange new environments which 
they would encounter. 

"I'm trying to survive too," 
TJeich muttered. "But I'm already conditioned for it." 

For sentimental reasons, the 
old Winter book store was still 
maintained in an alley between 
two of the colossal buildings. It 
also served as a space and light 
saver, and was a quaint landmark with its ancient Donaldson 
Resistance Hedge, ft specialized 
mostly in pi ezo -electric recordings, tiny crystals mounted in 
elegant settings. The latest vogue 
was brouehe-operas for M'lady. 
("She Shall Have Music Wherever She Goes.") Winter also had 
shelves of fascinating old books. 

"I want scmethin™ special for a 
nd I've neglected," Reich told 

V ' c 'lCTm '■■ ■,: .'. f' 

He was iif mediately bombarded with merchandise and 
suggestions. 



"Not special enough," he complained. "Why don't you people 
hire a peeper and save your clients this trouble?" He began 
sauntering around the shop, 
tailed by a retinue of eager clerics. 
After he had dissembled sufficiently, and before the worried 
manager could send out for an 
emergency peeper salesman, 
Reich stopped before the bookshelves. 

"What's this?" he inquired, 
looking surprised. 

"Antique books, Mr. Reich.** 
The sales staff began explaining 
what books were and how they 
used to be produced, while Reich 
slowly examined his way toward 
the tattered brown volume that 
was his goal. He remembered it 
well. He had glanced through it 
five years ago and made a note 
of one particular device in his little black opportunity book. Old 
Geoffrey Reich wasn't the only 
Reich who believed in preparedness. 

"Interesting. What's this one?" 
Reich pulled down the brown 
volume. "Let's Play Party by 
Shirley Noyes. What's the date 
on it? You mean to say they had 
parties that long ago?" 

The staff assured him that the 
ancients were very modern in 
many astonishing ways. 

"Look at the contents," Reich 
chuckled. " 'Honeymoon Bridge' 
. . . 'Prussian Whist' . . . 'Post 



49 




 



Office* . . . *Sardine\ What in the 
world could that be? Page ninetysix. Let's have a look." 

Reich flipped pages until he 
came to a bold-face heading: 
HILARIOUS games. "Look at this," 
he laughed, pointing to the wellremembered paragraph. 

SARDINE 
One player is selected to be It. AU 
the lights are extinguished and the It 
hides anywhere in the house. After a 
few minutes, the players go to hnd the 
It, hunting separately. The first one 
who finds him does not reveal the fact, 
but hides with him wherever he is. 
Successively, each player finding the 
Sardines joins them until all are hidden in one place and the last player 
who is the loser is left to wander alone 
in the dark. 

"I'll take it," Reich said. "This 
is just the thing for mu — for my 
friend." 

rX^HAT evening he spent three 

hours carefully defacing the 
remains of the volume. With heat, 
acid, stain and scissors, he mutilated the game instructions, and 
every burn, every cut, every slash 
was a blow at D'Courtney's 
writhing body. When his proxy 
murders were finished, he had reduced every game to incomplete 
fragments. Only 'Sardine' was left 
intact. 

Reich wrapped the book, addressed it to <try, the appraiser, 
and dropped it into the airslot. It 
went off with a puff and a bang 



and returned an hour later with 
^try's official sealed appraisal. 
Reich's mutilations had not been 
suspected of being anything but 
the deterioration of ages. 

He had the book gift-wrapped 
with the appraisal enclosed, as 
was the custom, and slotted it to 
Maria Beaumont's house. Twenty minutes later came the reply, 
obviously written by herself: 

"Darling! I thot you'd forgotten litle ol sexy me. How 2 divine. Come to Beaumont House 
tonite. Were haveing a party. 
We'l play games from you're 
sweet gift." There was a portrait 
of Maria centered in the star of 
a synthetic ruby enclosed in the 
message capsule. 

Reich answered: "Devastated. 
Not tonight. One of my millions 
is missing." 

She answered: "Wenesday, you 
clever boy, I'll give you one 
of mine." 

He replied: "Delighted to accept. Will bring guest. I kiss all 
of yours." He went to bed. 

And screamed at The Man 
With No Face. 

WEDNESDAY morning, 
Reich visited the laboratory 
department of Sacrament — "Paternalism, you know" — and spent 
a stimulating hour with the bright 
young men. He discussed their 
work and their glowing futures 
if they would only have faith in 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



43 



Sacrament. He told the old dirty 
joke about the neurotic pioneer 
who made the emergency landing 
on Joan Turnout's starship — and 
the corpse said: "I'm just one of 
the tourists!" — and the bright 
young men laughed subserviently, feeling slightly contemptuous 
of the boss. 

This enabled Reich to drift into 
the Restricted Room unnoticed 
and pick up one of the Rhodopsin Ionizers, a cube of copper half 
the size of a fulminating cap, but 
twice as deadly as a time-machine. There would be a stink if 
the loss was noted in the weekly 
inventory, and one of the bright 
young men might have trouble 
With government inspectors and 
acquire a sentence; but by that 
time D'Courtney would be dead 
and rotting. 

Wednesday afternoon, Reich 
went over to Melody Lane in the 
heart of the Panty district and 
called on Psych-Songs, Inc. 
There was a clever young woman 
there who had written some brilliant jingles for Sales and some 
effective strikebreaking songs for 
Propaganda back when Sacrament needed everything to smash 
that labor fracas in the Asteroid 
Belt. Duffy Wyg&, her name was, 
and she insisted that Duffy wasn't 
• nickname. Had been in the 
family for years. 

"Weil, Duffy?" He kissed her 
casually. She was pretty as a 



planet, but a trifle too young. 

"Well, Mr. Reich? Still wearing 
that hideous tweed? No woman 
to guide you," She looked at him 
oddly. "Some day I'm going to 
hire one of those Lonely Heart 
Peepers to case your kiss. I keep 
thinking you don't mean business." 

"I don't." 

"You dog." 

"A man has to make up nil 
mind early, Duffy, If he kisses 
girls, he kisses his money goodby." 

"You kiss me." 

"Only because you Ye the 
image of the lady on the sovereign." 

"Pip," she said. 

"Pop," he said. 

"Bim," she said. 

"Bam," he said. 

"I'd like to kill the gimp-head 
who invented that exchange," 
Duffy said revoltedly. "All right, 
handsome. What's your problem?" 

"Gambling," Reich said. "Ellery West, my Rec director, it 
complaining about the gambling 
in Sacrament. Says there's too 
much. Personally, I don't care." 

"Keep a man in debt and he's 
afraid to ask for a raise." 

"You're entirely too smart, 
young lady." 

"So you want a no- gambletype song?" 

"Something like that. Catchy. 



44 



GALAXY SCIINCt FICTION 



Not too obvious. More a delayed 
action than a straight propaganda tune. I'd like the conditioning to be more or less unconscious." / 

Duffy nodded and made quick 
notes. 

"And p/ease make it a tune 
worth hearing. I'lL be listening 
to God knows how many people 
singing and whistling and humming it." 

"You louse. All my tunes are 
worth hearing.'* 

"Once." 

"That's a thousand extra on 
my bill." 

Reich laughed. "Speaking of 
monotony ..." i 

"Which we weren't." 

"What's the most persistent 
tune you ever wrote?" 

"Persistent?" 

"You know what I mean. Like 
those advertising jingles you can't 
get out of your head." 

"Oh, Pepsis, we call 'em." 

"Why?" 

"They say because the first 
one was written centuries ago for 
the primitive radio and TV they 
had then by a character named 
Pepsi. Well, maybe. I don't know. 
I wrote one once . . ." Duffy 
winced in recollection. "Hate to 
think of it even now. It haunted 
me for a year." 

"You're rocketing." 

"Scout's honor, Mr. Reich. It 
was Tenser, Said the Tensor. I 



wrote it for that Panty about the 
crazy mathematician. They 
wanted nuisance value and they 
sure got it. People got so sore, 
they had to withdraw the Panty. 
Lost a fortune." 

"Let's hear it." 

"I couldn't do that to you." 

"Come on, Duffy. I'm curious." 

"You'll regret it." 

"I don't believe you." 

"All right, pig." she said, and 
pulled the multivox panel toward 
her. "This pays you back foe 
the flabby kiss." 

Her fingers and palms slipped 
gracefully over the panel. A tune 
filled the room with agonizing, 
unforgettable banality. It was the 
quintessence of every musical 
cliche Reich had ever heard. No 
matter what melody you tried 
to remember, it invariably led 
down the path of familiarity to 
Tenser, Said the Tensor. Then 
Duffy began to sing in an excruciating little voice: 

Eight, sir; seven, sir; 

Sift, sir; five, sir; 

Four, sir; three, sir; 

Two, sir; one! 

Tenser, said the Tensor. 

Tenser, said the Tensor. 

Tension, apprehension 

And dissension have begun. 

"Oh, my God!" Reich exclaimed. 

"I've got some real clever-up 
tricks in that tune." Duffy said, 
still playing. "Notice the beat 



THI DIMOMSHED MAN 



after 'one?' That's a semi-cadence. Then you get another beat 
after 'begun.' That turns the encf 
of the song into a semi-cadence, 
too, so you can't ever end it. The 
beat keeps you running in circles, 
like: Tension, apprehension and 
dissension have begun. RIFF. 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. RIFF. Tension, appre — " 

"Duffy!" Reich protested. 

"Another thing," she continued 
blandly. "There are thirteen syllables in the last two lines. You'd 
be surprised at the subconscious 
symbolic effect. Count them. 
Tension, apprehension and dissen — " 

Reich started to his feet, 
pounding his palms on his ears. 
"How long is this affliction going 
to last?" 

"Not less than a month." 

"Tension, apprehension and 
diss — I'm ruined. Isn't there any 
Way out?" 

"Sure," Duffy said. "It's easy. 
Just ruin me." She pressed herself against him and planted an 
earnest young kiss. "Lout," she 
murmured. "Pig. Boob. Dolt. 
When are you going to drag me 
through the gutter? Clever up, 
dog. Why aren't you as smart as 
I think you are?" 

"I'm smarter," he said, and 
left. 

The song established itself 
firmly in his mind and echoed 



painfully all the way down to the 
street. Tenser, said the Tensor. 
Tenser, said the Tensor, Tension, 
apprehension and dissension have 
begun. RIFF. A perfect mindblock for a non-Esper to use. 
What peeper could get past that? 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"Much smarter." muttered 
Reich, and took a Jumper to 
Jeremy Church's pawnshop on 
the upper west side. 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"T|ESPITE all rival claims, 
•"-^ pawnbroking is undoubtedly 
the oldest profession. It extends 
from the depths of the past to 
the uttermost reaches of the future, as unchanging as the pawnbroker's shop itself. You walked 
into Jeremy Church's cellar store, 
which was crammed and littered 
with the debris of time, and you 
were in a museum of eternity. 
And even Church himself, wizened, peering, his face blackened 
and bruised by the internal blows 
of suffering, was the very Ur-type 
or final evocation of humanity. 

Church shuffled out of the 
shadows and came face to fare 
with Reich, standing starkly illuminated in a patch of sunlight 
slanting across the counter. He 
did not start. He did not acknowledge Reich's identity. Brushing 
past the man who was his mortal 




 



enemy, he placed himself behind 
the counter and said: "Yes, 

please?" < '> . 
"Hello, Jerry." 

Without looking up, Church 
extended his hand across the 
counter. Reich attempted to clasp 
it. It was snatched away. 

"No," Church said with a snarl 
that was a haTf hysterical laugh, 
"Not that, thank you. Just give 
me what you want to pawn." 

It was the peeper's sour little 
trap, and he had tumbled into it. 
No matter. 

"I haven't anything to pawn, 
Jerry." 

"As poor as that? How the 
mighty have fallen. But we must 
expect it, eh? We all fall." 
Church glanced sidelong at him, 
trying to peep him. Let him try. 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. Let him get 
through the crazy tune rattling 
in his head. 

"All of us fall," Church said. 
"All of us." 

"I expect so, Jerry. I haven't 
yet. I've been lucky." 

"I wasn't lucky," the peeper 
said bitterly. "I met you." 

"Jerry," Reich said patiently. 
"I've never been your bad luck. 
It was your own luck that ruined 
you. Not — " 

"You bastard," Church said 
with a horrible lack of emphasis. 
"You cheating, lying, rotten cannibal. Get out of here. I want 



nothing to do with you." 

"Not even my money?" Reich' 
withdrew ten crisp ten sovereign 
notes from his pocket and placed 
them on the counter. Tension, apprehension and dissension have 
begun . . . 

"I want your heart cut open. 
I want your blood spilling on 
the ground, I want the maggots 
eating the eyes out of your living 
head. I don't want your money." 

"Then what do you want, 
Jerry?" 

\ "I told you!" the peeper 
screamed. "Your freezing blood!" 

"What do you want, Jerry?" 
Reich repeated, keeping his eyes 
on the * wizened man. Tension, 
apprehension and dissension have 
begun. He could still control 
Church. It didn't matter that 
Church had been a 2nd, for cbntrol wasn't a question of peeping; 
it was a question of personality. 
Eight, sir; seven, sir; six, sir; five, 
sir . . . He always had and always 
would control Church. 

"What do you want?" Church 
asked sullenly. 

Reich snorted. "You're the 
peeper. You tell me." 

"I can't read it. There's crazy 
music mixing everything up." 

"Then I'll have to tell you. I 
want a gun." 

"A what?" 

"G-U-N. Gun. Ancient weapon. It propels projectiles by explosion." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



M haven't anything like that." 

••Yes, you do, Jerry. Keno 
Quizzard mentioned it to mt 
tome time ago. He saw it. Steel 
and collapsible. Very interesting 
antique." 

"What do you want it for?" 

"Read me, Jerry, and find out. 
I haven't anything to hide. It's 
all quite innocent." 

Church screwed up his face, 
then quit in disgust. "You won't 
stick me with that nagging tune." 
He shuffled off into the shadows. 
There was a distant slamming of 
metal drawers, then the sharp 
crack of a split protective bulb. 
Church returned with a compact 
nodule of tarnished steel and 
placed it on the counter alongside the money. He pressed a stud 
and the lump of metal sprang 
open into steel knuckle-rings, revolver and stiletto. 

"What do you want it for?** 
Church asked again. 

"You're hoping it's something 
that can lead to blackmail, eh?" 
Reich smiled. "Sorry. It's a gift." 

"A dangerous gift." The peeper 
gave him that sidelong glance 
of snarl and laugh. "Ruination 
for someone else, eh?" 

"Not at all, Jerry. It's a gift 
for a friend of mine. Dr. T8." 

"T8!" Church stared at him. 

"Do you know him? He collects old things." 

"I know him." Church began 
to chuckle asthmatically, "But 



I'm beginning to know him better. I'm beginning to feel sorry 
for him." He stopped laughing 
and shot a penetrating glance at 
Reich. "Of course! This will make 
a lovely gift for Gus. A fine 
gift for Gus. Because it's loaded." 
"Oh? Is it?" 

"Five lovely cartridges. A gift 
for Gus." He touched a cam. A 
cylinder snapped out of the side 
of the gun, displaying five chambers filled with brass cartridges. 
He looked from the cartridges to 
Reich. "Five serpent's teeth to 
give to Gus." 

"I told you this was innocent," 
Reich said in a hard voice. "We'll 
have to pull those teeth." 

Church stared at him in astonishment, then began to nod mischievously. "We will, we will,** 
he chirped in a strangely delighted voice. He trotted down 
the aisle and returned with two 
small tools. "A gift for Gus," he 
chanted, almost hysterically. "A 
gift for nice little, rich little, 
happy little Gus." Quickly he 
wrenched each of the metal slugs 
from the cartridges. He slid the 
cases back into the chambers, 
snapped the cylinder home and 
then placed the gun alongside the 
money. 

"All. safe," he said brightly. 
"Safe for dear little Gus." 

He looked at Reich expectantly. Reich extended both hands. 
With one he pushed the money 



CAIAXY SCIENCE MOTION 



toward Church, with the other 
he drew the gun toward himself. 
At that instant. Church changed 
again. The air of chirpy evil left 
him. He grasped Reich's wrists 
with iron claws and bent across 
the counter with blazing intensity. 

"No, Ben," he said, using the 
name for the first time. "That 
isn't the price. You know it. Despite that crazy song in your 
head, I know you know it." 

"All right, Jerry," Reich said 
steadily, never relaxing his hold 
on the gun. "What is the price?" 

"It isn't money. You know 
that. There's been too much 
passed between us for money to 
pass again," 

"What do you want, Jerry?" 

"I know Gus is working for 
you." 

"You didn't get that from me." 

"I got it at Pres — never mind 
where I got it; I know. You're 
cooking something poisonous for 
Gus, aren't you? Something like 
you cooked for me." 

"With a harmless gun? You 
removed the poison yourself, 
Jerry. Remember that." 

"In case I'm asked?" 

"Why should anyone ask?" 

"I don't care what you do to 
Gus. I care about what you do 
for me." 

"What do you want? What's 
the price?" 

"I want to be reinstated," the 



ostracized peeper said. "I want 
to get back into the Gutfd. I want 
to be alive again. That's the 
price." 

"What can I do? I'm not a 
peeper. I don't belong to the 
Guild." 

"You got to me. You got to T8. 
You could get to the Guild. You 
could have me reinstated." 

"Impossible." 

"You can bribe, blackmail, intimidate . . . bless, dazzle, fascinate. You can do it, Ben. You can 
do it for me. Help me, Ben. I 
helped you once." 

"I paid through the nose for 
that help." 

"And I? What did I pay?" the 
peeper screamed. "I paid with 
my life!" 

"You paid with your stupidity." 

"For God's sake, Ben, help me! 
Help me or kill me. I just haven't 
the guts to commit suicide." 

"I haven't got that price in 
my pocket, Jerry. Nobody has." 

"All right. Listen." Church 
tightened his grasp on Reich's 
wrists and leaned farther forward. "Here's what you can do. 
Go to the police. Go to Preston 
Powell. Tell him what really happened in the Chaos Swindle. It'll 
be a Confession, but you'll get 
off, Ben. A big man like you can 
always get off. And I'll be cleared. 
I can get back into the Guild. 
What do you say?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



After a pause, Reich said brutally: "1 think The best thing for 
you, Jerry, would be suicide." 

The peeper flung himself back 
as though he had suddenly been 
scorched. 

"Now tell me the price," Fcich 
said. 

Deliberately, Church spat on 
the money. "There will be no 
charge," he said, and turned and 
disappeared into the shadows of 
the cellar. ' 



V 

UNTIL it was destroyed for 
reasons lost in the misty confusion of the late 20th Century, 
the Pennsylvania Station in New 
York City was, unknown to millions of travelers, a link in time. 
Commuters hurtling down the 
east escalators to the terminal 
floor rarely looked up at the towering interior columns and 
groined vaults. Those tourist! 




THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



who gaped and gasped rarely 
knew that all this had been before. They could not know that it 
would be again. The interior of 
the giant terminal was a replica 
of the mighty Baths of Caracalla 
in ancient Rome. So also was the 
sprawling mansion of Maria 
Beaumont, known to her thousand most intimate enemies as 
The Gilt Corpse. 

As Ben Reich glided down the 
east ramp with Dr. T8 at his side 
and murder in his pocket, he 
communicated with his senses in 
stacatto spurts. The sight of the 
mob on the floor below . . . the 
glitter of uniforms, of dress, of 
phosphorescent flesh, of beams 
of pastel light swaying on stilt 
legs . . . 

The sound of voices, of music* 
of annunciators, of echoes . . . 
The kinesthetic squeeze of his 
chest in a clash of hatred and 
terror . . . Tension, apprehension 
end dissension . . . The wonderful 
potpourri, the scent of flesh and 
perfume, of food, of wine, of gilt 
ostentation . . . Tension, apprehension . . . 

The gilt trappings of death, of 
something which had failed for 
seventy years. A lost art ... a* 
lost as phlebotamy, chierurgy, 
alchemy . . . He'd bring death 
back. Not the hasty, crazy killing of the psychotic, the brawler, 
the killings they knew then, but 
the. deliberate, planned — ■ 



"For God's sakef T8 muttered. "Be careful, man. Your 
murder's showing." 

Eight, sir; seven, sir . . . 

"That's better. Here's one of 
the peeper secretaries. He just 
wants to rub elbows with the 
mighty, but keep singing." 

A slender, willowy young man, 
all gush, all cropped golden hair, 
all violet blouse and silver culottes: 

"Dr. T8I Mr. Reich?. I'm 
speechless. Actually." 

Six, sir; five, sir . . . 

T8 shook hands with the secretary. "Hello, Glass. Nice seeing 
you. Miss you at the Guild meetings." 

"I love you for saying it, but 
I hate you because you don't 
mean if." The peeper glanced at 
Reich curiously. " Whatever ia 
going on in Mr. Reich's mind?" 

"Some idiotic song plaguing 
him. Like those ad jingles." 

"Or that old story of Mark 
2ain*s about the poem that 
haunted him? You know—

"Exactly. Reictis got himsett 
infected the same way." 

"You mean the great man's 
actually human?" 

"Superhuman" T8 darted a 
glance of respect mixed with malice at his dragooning employer. 

Plunging into the pools of 
guests was like diving into a tropical aquarium. Swirls of glittering, brilliant human fish. Tables 
of gilt comestables like white and 
cold coral islands. Voices like 
bubbles, all tinkle and pop. The 
ceaseless ground-swell of the 
party heaving in quick tides 
around the celebrities. 

Maria Beaumont clove through 
the waters, arms outstretched, 
eyes outstretched, bosom outstretched . . . her body transformed by pneumatic surgery 
into an exaggerated East Indian 
figure with puffed hips, puffed 
calves and puffed gilt breasts. 

"Ben, darling creature!" She 
embraced him with pneumatic 
intensity. "It's too too wonderful." 

"It's too too plastic, Maria." 

"Have you found that lost million yet?" 

"Just laid hands on it now." 

"Be careful, audacious lover. 
I'm having every morsel of this 
divine party recorded." 

Over her shoulder, Reich shot 
a glance at T8, hovering like an 
escort destroyer. T8 shook his 
head reassuringly. 



"Come and meet everybody 
who's everybody," Maria said. 
She took his arm. In her pea-hen 
whisper, she shrilled: "We'll have 
ages for ourselves later." 

The lights in the groined vaults 
overhead changed again and 
shifted up the spectrum. The 
costumes changed color. Skin 
that had glowed pink now shone 
with eerie luminescence. 

Symon Zigerra . . . Jeanny 
Wonchalk.. . . Tom Moyse, still 
hating him for that dirty trick at 
the Tycho Conference . . . Gloria 
Blomefield, Jr., still as sensual as 
that September weekend when he 
took the Blomefield formula from 
her fay resisting her . . . Bill Winter, still pleading for justice with 
his silent, terrified eyes . . . Bart 
Van Tuerk . . . Edmund Barr, 
who had to be blackmailed out 
of that Sacrament expose . . • 
Toni Asj, still wearing that diamond he gave her when she submitted to degradation to buy 
back those shares of the Stellar 
Syndicate. She never got the 
shares, but she had the diamond. 
She attributed her degeneracy to 
him, he'd heard. 

On his left flank, T8 gave the

Maria was introducing another 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

lad, all gush, all crapped copper 
hair, all fuchsia blouse and Prussian blue culottes. 

"Larry Ferar, Ben. My other 
social secretary. Larry's been dying to meet you." 

Four, sir; three, sir . . . 

"Mr. Reich! But too thrilled. 
I can't utter word one." 

Two, sir; one! 

The young man accepted 
Reich's smile and moved on. Still 
circling in convoy, T8 gave Reich 
a reassuring nod. Again the overhead lights changed. Portions of 
the guests' costumes appeared to 
dissolve. Reich, who had never 
succumbed to the fashion of 
wearing ultra-violet windows in 
his clothes, stood secure in his 
opaque suit, watching with contempt the quick, roving eyes 
around him. 

T8 signaled: Danger! 

Tenser, said the Tensor . . . 

Glass appeared at Maria's elbow. "Madame." he lisped, "a 
slight contretemps." 

"What is it?" 

"The Chervil boy. Galen Chervil." 

T8's face constricted. 

"What about him?" Maria 
peeped through the crowd. 

"Left of the fountain. An impostor, madame. I have peeped 
him. He has no invitation. He*3 
a college student. He bet he could 
crash the party. He intends to 
steal a picture of you as proof," 



"Of me?" Maria said, staring 
through the windows in young 
Chervil's clothes. "What does he 
think of me?" 

"Well, madame, he's extremely 
difficult to probe. I think he'd 
like to steal more from you than 
your picture." 

"Oh, would he?" Maria cackled. 

"He would, madame. Shall he 
be removed?" 

"No." Maria glanced once 
more at the formidable young 
man, then turned away. "He'll 
get his proof." 

"And it won't be stolen," Rei^li 
said. 

"Jealous!" she squawked. 
"Let's dine." 

In response to T8's urgent sign, S 
Reich stepped aside momentarily. 

"Reich, you've got to give it 
up." 

"You're crazy! Why should 1?" 

"The Chervil boy." 

"What about him?" 

"He's a 2nd." 

"Damn!" 

"He's precocious, brilliant. I 
met him at Powell's last Sunday. 
Maria Beaumont never invites 
peepers to her house. I'm only in 
on your pass. I was depending on 
that." 

"And this kid has to crash!" 

"Give it up, Reich." 
'.■ "Maybe I can stay away from 
htm." 

"Reich, I can block the social

secretaries; they're only 3rds. But 
I can't guarantee to handle them 
nnd a 2nd, even if he is only a 
hid. He's young and he may be 
too nervous to do any clever 
peeping. But I can't promise." 

"I'm not quitting," Reich 
growled. "I'll never get a chance 
like this again. Even if I knew 
I could, 1 wouldn't quit. I 
couldn't. I've got the stink of 
D'Courtney in my nostrils. I — ** 

"Then we'd better Have the 
Chervil boy bounced." 

"Not a chance. You saw the 
way she looked him over." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"Go through with it, damn 
you!" 

"You'll never — " 

Reich turned his scowl full on 
T8's nervous face. "I know you're 
looking for a chance to squirm 
out of this, you little bastard. But 
you won't. We're trapped in this 
together, right down the line, all 
the way to Demolition." 

He shaped his distorted face 
into a frozen smile and rejoined 
his hostess on a couch alongside 
one of the tables. It was still the 
custom to feed each other at 
these affairs, but the gesture that 
had originated in Oriental courtesy and generosity had degenerated into erotic play. The morsels 
of food were accompanied by 
tongue touched to fingers and 
were as often offered between the 
lips. 



Reich endured it all with a 
seething impatience, waiting for 
the vital word from T8. Part of 
T8's Intelligence work was to locate D'Courtney 's hiding place in 
the house. He watched the little 
peeper drift through the crowd of 
diners, probing, prying, searching, 
until he at last returned with a 
negative shake of his head and 
gestured toward Maria Beaumont. Clearly, Maria was the 
only source of information, and 
she was too obsessed to be easily 
probed. It was another in a neverending series of crises that had to 
be met by the killer- instinct. 

Between the Truite Au Bleu 
and the Saueisses Au Vin Blanc, 
Reich^arose and crossed toward 
the fountain. T8 intercepted him. 

"What are you up to, Reich?'* 

"Isn't it obvious? Get the Chervil boy off her mind." 

"Reich, don't go near that 
boy!" 

"Get out of my way." Reich 
radiated a burst of savage compulsion that made the peeper recoil. He signaled in fright and 
Reich tried to control himself. 

"It's taking chances, I know, 
but the odds aren't as long as 
you think. In the first place, he's 
young and green. In the second 
place, he's a crasher and scared. 
In the third place, he can't be flying full jets or he wouldn't have 
let the secretaries peep him so 
easily." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Have you got any conscious 
control? Can you double-think?" 

"I've got that song on my mind 
and enough trouble to make 
double-thinking a pleasure. Now 
get the hell out of the way and 
stand by to peep Madame, The 
Gilt Corpse." 

CHERVIL was eating alone 
alongside the fountain, clumsily attempting to appear to 
belong. 

■"Pip," said Retch. 
''Pop/* said Chervil. 
"Bim," said Reich. 
"Bam," said Chervil. 
With the formality of slang 
disposed of, Reich eased himself 
down alongside the boy. "I'm 
Ben Reich." 

"I'm Gaily Chervil. I mean 
Galen. I — " He was visibly impressed by the name of Reich. 

Tension, apprehension and distension . . . 

"That damned song," Reich 
muttered. "Heard it for the first 
time the other day. Can't get it 
out of my mind. Eight, sir; seven, 
sir; six, sir; five — Oh, for God's 
sake! Talk to me, Chervil, before 
I go crazy." 

"What should I talk about?" 
"Ever been in The Gilt Corpse 
before?" 

"Do you mean the house?" 
"Pop," grinned Reich. 
"Pip," smiled the boy. 
"She knows you're a phony." 



"No!" 

Reich nodded. Tension, apprehension . . . 

"Should I start running?" 

"Without the picture?" 

"You know about that too? 
There must be a peeper around." 

"Two of them. Her social secretaries. People like you are their 
job." 

"What about that picture, Mr. 
Reich? I've got fifty dollars rid* 
ing on it. You ought to know 
what a bet means. You're a gamb 
—I mean, financier." 

"Glad I'm not a peeper, eh? 
Never mind, I'm not insulted. 
See that arch? Go straight 
through and turn right. You'll 
find a study. The walls are 
lined with Maria's portraits, all 
in synthetic stones. Help yourself. 
She'll never miss one." 

The boy leaped up, scattering 
food off his lap. "Thanks, Mr. 
Reich. Some day I'll do you a 
favor." 

"Such as?" 

"You'd be surprised. I happen 
to be a — " He caught himself and 
blushed. "You'll find out. si r. 
Thanks again." He began weaving his way across the floor toward the north arch. 

Four, sir; rhree, sir; twn, sir; 
one! 

Reich returned to his hostess. 

"Naughty lover," she said. 
"Who've you been feeding? I'll 
tear her eyes out." 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTIOM 



"The Chervil boy," Reich answered. "He asked me where you 
keep your pictures." 

"Ben! You didn't tell him!" 

"Sure did. He's on his way to 
get one now. Then he'll take off. 
You know I'm jealous." 

She leaped from the couch and 
waddled north. 

"Bam," said Reich. 

T> Y eleven o'clock, the ritual of 
dining had aroused the company to a point of intensity that 
required solitude and darkness. 
Maria Beaumont had never failed 
her guests, and tonight Reich 
hoped The Gilt Corpse would not 
fail him when T8 appeared, looking pleased and yet worried. 

"1 don't know how you got 
away with it," T8 whispered. 
"You're broadcasting bloodlust 
on every wavelength." 

"The kid doesn't know?" 

"Not a notion. You were right. 
He's scared ... off balance." 

"And I know who knocked him 
off balance. Where's D' Courtney?" Reich grabbed TS's arm. 
"Don't tell me he isn't in the 
house, you little roach. I can 
smell him waiting for me." 

"Reich!" T8 tore his arm away. 
"Yes, he's here. Alone. No servants. Only two bodyguards provided by Maria. @kins was right. 
He's dangerously sick . . ." 

"To hell with that I'll cure 
him. Where is he?" 



"Go through the west arch. 
Turn right. Up the stairs. 
Through overpass. Turn right. 
Picture Gallery. Door between 
paintings of the Rape of Lucrece 
and the Rape of the Sabine 
Women . . ." 

"That sounds authentic." 

"Open the door. Up a flight of 
steps to an anteroom. Two guards 
in the anteroom. D'Courtney's inside, It's the old wedding suite 
her grandfather built." 

"The wedding suite? I like that 
touch." 

The Gilt Corpse began to 
clamor for attention. Flushed and 
shining with perspiration, standing in the glare of a pink light on 
the dais between the two fountains, she clapped her hands for 
silence: Smack, smack, smack. 
The moist palms beat together, 
and the echoes roared in Reich's 
ears: Death, death, death, 

"Darlings!" she cried. "We're 
going to have so much fun tonight. We're going to provide our 
own entertainment." A subdued 
groan went up from the guests 
and an anonymous voice called.: 
"I'm just one of the tourists." 

Through the laughter, Maria 
said: "Naughty lovers, don't be 
disappointed. We're going to play 
a wonderful old game; and we're 
going to play it in the dark." 

The company cheered up as 
the overhead lights began to dim 
and disappear. The dais still 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

blazed and, in the light, Maria 
produced a tattered volume. 
Reich's gift. 
Tension . . . 

Maria turned the pages slowly, 
blinking at the unfamiliar print. 

.Apprehension . . . 

"It's a game," Maria cried, 
"called Sardine. Isn't that too 
adorable?" 

She took the bait. She's on the 
hook. In three minutes I'll be invisible. Reich touched his pockets. The disarmed gun. The Rhodopsin. Tension, apprehension 
und dissension have begun. 

"One player," Maria read, "is 
selected to be It. That's going to 
be me. All the lights are ex — 
extinguished and the It hides." 

As Maria struggled through the 
directions, the great hall was reduced to pitch darkness with the 
exception of the single pink beam 
on the stage. 

"Sue — successively, each player finding the Sardines joins them 
until all are hidden in one place, 
and the last player, who is the 
loser, is left to wander alone in 
the* dark." The last light blinked 
out. Reich was invisible at last. 
He bed half an hour to slip up 
into the house, kill D'Courtney, 
and then return to the game. T8 
was committed to pinning the 
peeper secretaries out of the line 
of his attack. It was safe. It was 
fool-proof except for the Chervil 
boy. He had to take that chance. 



HE crossed the main hall and 
jostled into mewing bodies at 
the west arch. He went through 
the arch into the music room. 
The piezo crystals were resonating automatically in the back" 
ground, but there were muffled 
dischords from an open piano as 
though the strings were being 
used for a wrestling mat. Savage 
and intent, Reich ignored this 
and turned right, groping for the 
stairs. A curse and a clash 
sounded from the piano, then 
shod feet ran .across the floor and 
somebody soft banged into him. 

"If you touch me," the voire 
of Duffy Wyg& cried hysterically, 
"IH kill you." 

Reich froze. "Duffy!" he exclaimed, and then could have torn 
his tongue out. 

"Who's that? Mr. Reich?" 
"Yes." 

Her hand touched his arm and 
felt the cloth. "Bless you, Mr. 
Reich." She leaned against him 
weakly. "God bless that hideous 
tweed." 

"What's the matter. Duffy ? 
Don't you like the gutter?* 1 

"I don't like the company." 

"Then go back to Melody 
Lane." 

She held tight to his arm. "This 
is my first and last visit. How do 
I get out of this sty?" 

"Back through the main hall 
and up the ramp." 

"I don't know which way is 




 



which. Get me out of here, Mr. 
Reich. I need a bodyguard." 

In an agony of impatient fury, 
he searched for excuses. A retching voice' behind him said: "Can 
1 d-do you a favor, Mr. Reich?'* 

''Who's that?" 

"A refugee. Galen Chervil. 
Slightly sick." 

Eight, sir; seven, sir; six, sir; 
five, sir . . . 

The Chervil boy loomed in the 
darkness alongside. "I had to run 
hard to get away from that . . . 
picture. I'm still running, between 
spasms, I never was happier to 
lose fifty dollars." 

Four, sir; three, sir; two, sir; 
one! 

"I'm running too," Duffy said, 

"Just babes in the woods," 
Chervil said. "High-life. Pfoo! 
Let's run together." 

"Do you know the way out in 
the dark?" 

Tenser, said the Tensor. Tenser, said the Tensor. 

"I can find it. Give me -your 
hand, Duffy." 

"How do you know my name?" 

"Oop. Slip of the mind. Not 
myself tonight. Coming with us, 
Mr. Reich?" 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"No," Reich choked. "Wish r 
could. Impossible. You two kids 
get out of here. Jet!" 

They scuttled off in the dark. 

RIFF! 



At the foot of the stairs he was 
forced to climb over a barrier of 
bodies with octopus arms that 
tried to pull him down. He ascended the stairs, seventeen eternal steps, and felt his way 
through a close tunnel overpass 
papered with velour, Suddenly he 
was seized and a woman crushed 
herself against him. 

"Hello, Sardine," she whispered 
in his ear. "Ow!" she exclaimed, 
feeling the hard outlines of the 
gun in his breast pocket. "What's 
that?" He slapped her hand away. 
"Clever up, Sardine," she giggled. 
"Get out of the can." 

He divested himself of her and 
bruised his nose against the deadend of the overpass. He turned 
right, opened a door and found 
himself in a vaulted gallery over 
fifty feet long. The lights were 
extinguished here, too, but the luminiscent paintings, glowing under ultraviolet spotlights, filled 
the gallery with a virulent glow. 
It was empty. 

Between a livid Lucrece and a 
horde of buttocky Sabine Women 
was a door of polished bronze. 
Reich stopped before it, removed 
the tiny Rhodopsin Ionizer from 
his back pocket and attempted to 
poise the copper tube between 
his thumbnail and forefinger. His 
hands were trembling so violently 
that hecould not control them. 

His fingers steadied. He poised 
the Rhodopsin cap, then thrust 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



it 



open the bronze door, revealing 
nine steps mounting to an anteroom. Reich flipped his thumbnail against the copper cube as 
though he were trying to flip a 
penny to the Moon. 

As the Rhodcpsin cap flew up 
into the anteroom, Reich averted 
his eyes. There was a cold purple 
flash. Reich leaped up the stairs. 

The two Beaumont House 
guards were seated on the bench 
where he had caught them. Their 
faces were "sagging, their visual 
sense destroyed, their time sense 
abolished, their synapses clattering in sn"ort-circuited chaos. They 
were out of the continuum. 

If anyone entered and found 
the guards before he was finished, 
he was on the road to Demolition. 
If the guards revived before he 
was finished, he was on the road 
to Demolition. No matter what 
happened, it was a final gamble 
with Demolition. 

Leaving the last of his sanity 
behind him, Reich pushed open a 
jeweled door and entered the wedding suite. 

VI 

REICH found , himself in a 
spherical room that was the 
heart of a giant orchid. The walls 
were curling orchid petals, the 
pillars were stamens, the floor was 
a golden calyx; the chairs, tables 
and couches were orchid and gold. 



But the room was old . . . old . . , 

the petals faded and peeling, the 
golden tile floor ancient and the 
tessellations splitting. There was 
an old, old man stretched on the 
couch, musty and wilted, like a 
dried weed . . . like the dessication of a venomous mandrake 
root. 

It was D'Courtney, stretched 
out like a corpse. 

Reich slammed the door in 
rage. "You can't be dead! I can't 
be cheated!" 

The faded man started up, 
stared, then arose painfully from 
the couch, his face breaking into 
a smile. 

"Still alive!" Reich cried exultantly. 

D'Courtney stepped toward 
Reich, smiling, his arms outstretched, as though welcoming a 
prodigal son. The smile was almost imbecile. 

Alarmed again, Reich growled: 
"Are you deaf?" 

The old man shook his head. 

"You speak English, you son of 
a bitch," Reich shouted. "You can 
hear me. You can understand me, 
I'm Reich. Ben Reich of Sacrament." 

D'Courtney nodded, still smiling. His mouth worked soundlessly. His eyes glistened with 
sudden tears. 

"What the hell is the matter 
with you? I'm Reich. Ben Reich! 
Do you know me? Answer me." 




 



D'Courtney shook his head and 
tapped his throat. His mouth 
worltfcd again. Rusty sounds 
ceme; then words as faint as dust: 
"Ben . . . dear Ben . . . waited so 
long. Now . 7 . can't talk. My 
throat . , . can't talk." Again he 
attempted to embrace Reich. 

Bristling, Reich stepped around 
D'Courtney like an animal, his 
hackles raised, the murder boiling in his blood, the horrible images of D'Courtney's agony rushing through his congested eyes. 
His breath came in gasps. His 
heart pounded. He poised himself before D'Courtney and glared 
into the old man's face. 

D'Courtney's mouth formed 
the words: ''Dear Ben . . ." 

"You know why I'm here. 
What are you trying to do — make 
love to me?" His hand lashed 
out. The old man reeled back 
from the slap and fell into an 
orchid chair that looked like a 
wound. 

"Listen to me, you old son of 
a bitch." Reich followed D'Courtney and stood over him. "This 
payoff's been on the fire for years. 
Fire? Volcano! And you want to 
turn aside the magma with a 
Judas kiss!" 

"Ben," D'Courtney whispered 
in horror. "Listen, Ben . . 

"You've been at my throat for 
ten years. Ten years! There was 
room enough for both of us. Sacrament and D'Courtney. All the 



room In time and space, bu$ you 
wanted my blood, my heart. The 
Man With No Face!" 

D'Courtney shook his head in 
bewilderment. "No, Ben. No . . .** 

"Don't call me Ben. I'm no 
friend of yours. Last week I gave 
you one more chance to wash in 
decency. Me. Ben Reich. I asked 
for armistice. Merger. My father 
would spit on me if he were alive. 
Every fighting Reich would 
blacken my face with contempt. 
But I asked for peace, didn't I? 
Eh?" Reich prodded D'Courtney 
savagely. "Didn't I?" 

O'Courtney's face was blanched 
and staring. Finally he whispered: 
"Yes. You asked ... I accepted." 

"Accepted!" Reich cut in 
sharply. "Are these the tactics 
that win for you? It isn't possible, 
is it? The phony affection. Dear 
Ben. The warmth from a frozen 
heart. Empty stupid lies. What 
imbecile could swallow them?" 

Reich reached down and 
yanked D'Courtney to his feet. 
The old man was frail and light, 
but his weight bruised Reich's 
arm, and the touch of the old skin 
burned Reich's fingers. 

"No merger. No peace. Death. 
That's the choice, eh?" 

D'Courtney shook his head and 
tried to make signs. 

"Will you surrender?" 

"Yes," D'Courtney whispered. 
"Yes, Ben. Yes." 

"Liar! Protective mimicry. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



That's your trick. You imitate 
the idiots and trap us at your 
leisure. But not me. Never!" 

"I'm not . . . your enemy, Ben." 

"No," Reich spat. "You're not 
because you're dead. You've been 
dead ever since I came into this 
orchid coffin. Man With No Face! 
Can you hear me screaming for 
the last time? You're finished!" 

Reich tore the gun out of his 
breast pocket. He touched the 
stud and it opened like a red steel 
flower. D'Courtney backed away 
in horror. Reich caught the back 
of D'Courtney's thin neck and 
wrenched the head toward him. 
He had to fire through the open 
hiouth for the trick to work. 

At that instant, one of the orchid petals swung open, and a 
girl burst into the room. In a catastrophic blaze of surprise, 
Reich saw the corridor behind 
her, a bedroom door standing 
open at the far end; the girl, yellow hair flying, dark eyes wide in 
alarm ... a lightning flash of 
wild beauty. 

"Father !" she screamed. 

She ran toward D'Courtney. 
Reich swung quickly between 
them, never relaxing his hold on 
the old man. The girl stopped 
short, backed away, then darted 
to the left around Reich, screaming. Reich pivoted and cut viciously at her with the stiletto. 
She eluded him, but was driven 
back of the couch. Reich thrust 



the point of the stiletto between 
the old man's teeth and forced 
his jaws open. m 
"No!" she cried. "No! Father!" 
Reich pulled the trigger. There 
was a muffled explosion and a 
gout of blood spurted from the 
back of D'Courtney's head. Reich 
let the body drop. 

The girl fell forward to her 
knees and crawled to the body. 
She moaned in pain as she 
snatched the gun from the mouth, 
where it had still hung. Then she 
crouched over the twitching 
body, silent, fixed, staring into 
the waxen face. 

Reich gasped for breath and 
beat his knuckles together painfully. When the roaring in his 
ears subsided, he propelled himself toward the girl, trying to 
arrange his thoughts and make 
split-second alterations in his 
plans. He had never counted on a 
witness. No one mentioned a 
daughter. God damn T8! Now 
he would have to kill the girl. 
HeShe leaped to her feet, d;iii«il 
out of his sodden grasp, ran to 
the jeweled door, flung it open 
and ran into the anteroom. As 
the door slowly closed, Reich had 
a glimpse of the guards still 
slumped on the bench and the 
girl running silently down the 
stairs with the gun in her Standi 
. . . with Demolition in her hands. 
The clogged blood began 



*2 




 



pounding through his veins again. 
He reached the door, ran through 
and tore down the steps to the 
picture gallery. It was empty, 
but the door to the overpass was 
just closing. And still no sound 
from her. Still no alarm. How 
long before she started screaming 
the house down? 

He raced down the gallery and 
entered the overpass. It was 
still pitch dark. He blundered 
through, reached the head of the 
stairs that led down to the music 
room and paused again. He went 
down the steps. The dark silence 
was terrifying. Why didn't she 
scream? Where was she? 

Reich crossed toward the west 
arch and knew he was at the 
edge of the main hall by the quiet 
plash of the fountains. Where was 
the girl? In all that black silence, 
where was she? And the gun! 
Christ! The tricked gun! 

A hand touched his arm. Reich 
jerked in alarm. T8 whispered: 
"I've been standing by. It took 
you exactly — " 

"You clumsy peeper !" Reich 
burst out. "There was a daughter! Why didn't you — " 

T8 muttered, "Let me peep it.** 
After fifteen seconds of burning 
silence, he began to tremble. In a 
terrified voice he whined: "My 
God! Oh, my God . . 

His terror was the catalyst . 
Reich's control returned. He began thinking again, "Shut up," 



he growled. "It isn't Demolition 
yet." 

"You'll have to kill her too, 
Reich. You'll — " 

"Find her first. Cover the 
house. You got her pattern from 
me. Locate her. I'll be waiting at 
the fountain. Jet!" 

He flung T8 from him and 
staggered to the fountain. At the 
jasper rim, he bent and bathed 
his burning face in the water. It 
was sparkling burgundy. Reich 
wiped his face and ignored the 
muffled sounds that came from 
the other side of the basin. Evidently some persons were bathing 
in wine. 

He considered swiftly. The girl 
must be located and killed. At 
once. If she still had the gun 
when T8 found her, the gun 
would be used. If she didn't? 
Strangle her? No, the fountain. 
She could be found drowned in 
the fountain . . . just another 
guest who had bathed in wine 
too long. But it had to be soon, 
before this damned Sardine game 
was ended. Where was T8? 
Where was the girl? 

T8 came blundering up through 
the darkness, wheezing. 

"Well?" 

"She's gone." 

"You weren't gone long enough 
to find out. If this is a doublecross — " 

"Whom could I cross? I'm o« 
the same road you are- I tell you 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 




her pattern's nowhere in the 
house. She's gone." 

■ Anyone notice her leave?" 

"No." 

"Out of the house!" 

"We'd better leave, too." 

"Yes, but we can't run. Once 
we get out of here, we'll have the 
rest of the night to find her, but 
we can't sneak out. Too suspicious. Where's Maria?" 

"For God's sake, Reich . . ." 

"I tell you we've got to leave 
as though nothing's happened. 
Whi n 's The Gilt Corpse?" 

"In the projection room." 

"Watching a Panty?" 

"No. Still playing Sardine. 
They're packed in there like fish 
in a can. We're almost the last 
out here in the house." 

"Wandering alone in the dark, 
eh? Come on." 

He gripped T8's shaking elbow 
and marched him toward the projection room. As he walked, he 
called plaintively: "Hey, where 
is everybody? Maria!" 

T8 emitted a hysterical sob. 
Reich shook him roughly. "Play 
up! We'll be out of here in five 
minutes. Then you can start 
worrying," 

"If they find the body before 
we leave, we're sunk." 

"Who'll find the body?" 

"The guards." 

"Not in five minutes. They're 
out of this world. Well out." 
"Servants."

THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



"They won't leave their quarters till the Sardine game is over. 
I tell you we'll be safe in five 
minutes." 

"But if we're trapped in here, 
we won't be able to get the gid. 
We'll—" 

"We won't be trapped. ABC, 
Gus — audacious, brave and confident." Reich pushed open the 
door of the projection room. 
There was darkness in here, too, 
but the heat of many bodies. 
"Hey," he called. "Where is everybody? I'm all alone." 

No answer. 

"Maria, I'm all alone in the 
dark." 

A muffled sputter, then a burst 
of laughter. 

"Darling!" Maria called. 
"You've missed all the fun, poor 
dear." 

"Where are you, Maria? I've 
come to say good night." 

"Oh, you can't be leaving." 

"Sorry, dear. It's late. I've got 
to swindle a friend tomorrow. 
Where are you, Maria?" 

"Come up on the stage, darling." 

Reich walked down the aisle, 
felt for the steps and mounted the 
stage. He felt the cool perimeter 
off the Pantys glpbe behind him. 
A voice called: "All right. Now 
we've f*ot him. T.^hts!" 

White light flooded the globe 



and blinded Reich. The guests 
seated in the chairs around the 
stage started to whoop with 
laughter, then howled In disappointment. 

"Oh Ben, you cheat," Maria 
screeched. "You're still dressed. 
Xhat isn't fair. We've been catching everybody divinely flagrante" 

"Some other time, Maria dear." 
Reich extended his hand before 
him and began the graceful bow 
of farewell. "Respectfully, madame, I give you my thanks 
for — " He broke off in amazement. On the gleaming white lac^ 
of his cuff, an angry red spot appeared. 

In stunned silence, Reich saw 
a second, then a third red splotch 
appear. He snatched his hand 
back and a red drop spattered on 
the stage before him, to be followed by a slow, inexorable 
stream of crimson droplets, 

"That's blood!" Maria 
screamed. "There's someone upstairs bleeding. Ben. for heaven's 
sake, you can't leave now. Lights! 
Lights!" 

Blood — dripping through the 
ceiling — D'Courtney's blood, Not 
enough to fill a teaspoon yet, but: 
Reich felt he was drowning in it. 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun
