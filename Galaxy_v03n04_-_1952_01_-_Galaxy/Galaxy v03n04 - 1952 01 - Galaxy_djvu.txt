Gloom & Doom 



IT'S a depressing experience 
to sit at a desk and read 
story after story filled with 
pessimism and despair. The 
temptation is strong to write ; 
"Look, fellers, the end isn't here 
yet. It probably won't come, any 
more than the frantic prophecies 
of history occurred, including 
Wells's dismal forecasts of the 
world wars. Why not buck up 
and see the positive trends as 
well as the harrowing ones?" 

The fact is that I've written 
that letter, or something similar, 
to any number of writers. 
Net result: 

Over 90% of stories submitted 
still nag away at atomic, hydrogen and bacteriological war, the 
post-atomic world, reversion to 
barbarism, mutant children killed 
because they have only ten toes 
and fingers instead of twelve, 
world dictatorships, problems of 
survival wearily turned over to 
women, war, more war, and still 
more war — between groups, nations, worlds, solar systems. 

If it weren't so tiresome, it 
might be funny to see our transitory political rivalries carried into 
the remotest futures, I've been 
having the experience, while reading books to select for the GALAXY Novels series, to find old 
stories seriously debating the 



troubles that we of the middle 
20th Century were to have had 
with an arrogant Kaiser, fanatical Chinese Boxers, even a Napoleon. These books are dated 
enough in scientific and sociological ways, but the extension of 
long-resolved political questions 
into the future makes them almost laughable. 

Does that minimize the threats 
that existed then, or our present 
world situation? Certainly not. 
Neither is it escapism to project a 
future in which democracy vs. 
communism is no longer an issue. There is no way of knowing 
how long it will take that difficulty to be resolved, nor even — 
personal hopes aside — how or in 
whose favor. But there can be no 
doubt that it will become a part 
of history, along with slavery Vs. 
feudalism, and feudalism vs. 
democracy, bloomers and onepiece bathing suits for women. 

Science fiction has a more important job than to warn of 
doom. Its function is not to 
spread joy and optimism, either. 
The first is the province of news 
"analysts" and politicos, scientists with guilty consciences and 
the opponents of progress in any 
form. The second — brainlessly 
eager optimism — is dispensed 
adequately by light fiction and 



1 




 



popular articles informing us that 
disasters can be fun. 

As I've said before, science fiction should present possible developments based on present 
tendencies or trends, to answer 
in dramatic terms the unstated 
question: "What would happen 
if—?" 

Good Lord, the world today is 
loaded with ifs! So crammed, 
crowded, bulging with ifs jostling 
each other, in fact, that it's a pure 
bafflement to see writers turning 
the same ones over and over, 
looking for some new bump never 
before noti ced on the use- worn 
surfaces. 

If this applied only to new 
authors, it would warrant patient 
encouragement and no worry — 
just let them get past the obvious 
ideas and they'd be all right. But 
the most consistent practitioners 
of the trite are many established 
writers who should be making 
their greatest contribution now, 
with science fiction becoming so 
important a phenomenon that 
even the Russians had to pause 
between walkouts to term it a 
sign of capitalist degeneration! 

Actually, the growth of the 
field has paradoxically interfered 
with its growth. The movies, TV, 
slick magazines and book publishers have been concentrating 
on the sensational, or cataclysmic, aspects. Enough new magazines have been started to pro


vide a market for almost any 
story, no matter how unreadable, 
by any writer with a known 
name. Why should they knock 
themselves out to meet the high 
standards of GALAXY? They do 
not make as much per word, but 
the volume of sales supposedly 
compensates. 

There is an answer to that, but 
it's not visible to anyone too busy 
exploring the explored to see the 
less apparent. 

One after another, the new 
magazines — and many of the old 
— are dying of literary cirrhosis. 
The cause? Poisoning due to decayed fiction. 

There is a double solution to 
this quandary: established writers 
in many cases will have to revise 
their standards — and stories — 
and new authors must be induced to enter the field. 

GALAXY is trying fervently 
to accomplish both objectives. 
Known authors who depend only 
on their names to sell inferior 
fiction are finding no market in 
GALAXY; new authors who are 
willing to dig for ideas and fresh 
treatments are getting an enthusiastic, cooperative welcome. 

Cato noticed 2,000 years ago 
that the world was going to the 
dogs. If he were aKve now, he'd 
accept the present as a good substitute for Paradise — atomic 
threat or no atomic threat!

Opportunity, encounter or reencounter . . . all of them may be 
reproduced precisely and exactly 
over and over again on the planet 
of a sun in the Galaxy that revolves once in two hundred million years and has revolved nine 
times already. 

There are and have been worlds 
and cultures without end, each 
perhaps (_unaware of. the sobering 
mortification of statistics) nursing the proud illusion that it is 
unique, irreplaceable, irrepro-duceahle. There have been men 
without end, suffering from the 
same megalomania, who have 
made nations and worlds suffer 
too. There wilt be mote, more 
plus infinity. This is the story of 
much a man . . . The Demolished 
Man. 

ON Sol Double -3 (for the Cosmic Eye sees Earth and her 
moon as a planetary binary) in 
January of 2103, Edward Tuxnbul of Coates Teachers College 
decided to explore the Hysterisis 
Enigma for his research thesis. 
The Reamur Variations on the 
Einstein Post-mortem Equations 
had suggested a paradox whirh 
no one had bothered to explore. 
Atomic research had bypassed it; 
and what are the dead ends of 
science for if not to provide harm-. 
less occupation for graduate students? Turnbul studied the 
original research, ran a few du


plications and then tinkered with 
the apparatus. 

Get the picture: A serious 
young man, fat, sallow, a genuine 
bore. . A Phi Beta Kappa anesthetising his frustrations in a laboratory. A magnet is his sweetheart; caulds of X-27 Duplexor 
are his conjugal embraces. He 
tinkers at midnight and sublimates his maladjustments in the 
excitement and suspense of the 
experiment. Will it work? Can he 
really develop a commercial 
process, earn a million dollars 
and overpower women with this 
uncontestable proof of his virility? 

Turnbul unwraps a sandwich, 
aping the dashing insouciance of 
fictional heroes, then pulls the 
switch. The experiment works. 
Thirty -two pounds of apparatus 
and a liter of methylene dimethyl 
Tther loft up from the bench and 
smash against the ceiling. Turnbul has stumbled on something 
they just missed a century ago . . . 
ant'i-gravity. Unique? No. Inevitable. In the infinity of a universe 
crawling with searching, inquiring, experimenting creatures, this 
had happened, was happening 
and would happen beyond the 
count of simple integers. Statistics made it inevitable. 

Forget Turnbul. He is not your 
protagonist. If you identify with 
him, you will he lost in this story, 
as Turnbul htftiself is lost in the

shifting pattern that produced 
the Demolished Man. Turnbul 
patented; he was sued. He fought 
in courts for fifteen years with inadequate counsel and the patent 
was broken. Turnbul was notorious enough by that time to re-r 
eeive a full professorship at the 
Institute. He married a librarian, 
raised children, taught miserably, 
and jealously inspected each new 
textbook, content if credit for 
Nulgee was paid him in footnote 
or appendix. 

¥N September of 2110, Galen 
■* Gart's wife died. She was a 
tall, lustrous, remote woman, and 
he had loved her deeply for thirty 
years. They had been a devoted 
couple, and in the course of their 
marriage had grown to resemble 
each other, as couples often do. 
It was hard to distinguish their 
handwriting, their voices, their 
jokes. 

"We even think alike," Gart 
used to say. "Half the time I answer her before I realize she 
hasn't had a chance to speak her 
thoughts." And after her death 
he said : "What's the use of going 
on? We were part of each other. 
We didn't need words. How can 
anyone else give me the same intimacy?" 

But Galen Gart, fifty, desolate, 
prematurely aging, met a pungent child of twenty with an- exciting poi trine, a satin skin, and 



the infantile nickname of Duffy, 
and they were married six months 
after the funeral. 

"You're not so old in the dark," 

"Why, Duffy !" exclaimed Mr. 
Gart. "What a nice thing to say." 

"But I didn't say anything.** 
Nor had she. 

It was a year before Mr. Gart 
realized that it was he who didn't 
need words. It became his joke, 
his little parlor trick, a quaint 
trait. 

"So this is the famous Galen 

Gart. Mind reader? Imposs. 

Tricks. Can't fool me. Can't read 

my mind." 

"But I can, dear lady. I can.** 
"You ca — But I didn't say it. 

I—" 

"Hey! Everybody! Gart's done 
it again." 

"Look at her blush." 

"What's she thinking, Gart?** 

"Why's she blushing?" 

"The lady," Mr. Gart smiled, 
"is thinking that I'm laughing at 
her. She's blushing because I'm 
telling her I admire her. She has 
one of the loveliest minds I have 
ever met." 

Laughter. 

Oh yes; laughter at the quaint 
trait when gentle, tactful, courteous Mr. Gart performed his 
parlor trick. But the trait was an 
extracted recessive that appeared 
in his son. 

There was no more laughter 
when the amoral animal that a 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



7 



child is discovered it had inherited Extra Sensory Perception and 
used it brutally. Galon Gart, Jr., 
turned laughter to tears, and 
many texts were written about 
his lurid criminal career that 
ended with his murder. And 
Galen Gart, Jr., Esper blackmailer, confidence trickster and 
thief, helped produce The Demolished Man. 

THE vacant lot across the way 
from Sheridan Place was finally sold, and Space Clubs, Inc., 
was forced to move its Raffle 
Office and prizes to Brooklyn. 
Their funds barometer, a miniature explosive rocket hanging 
halfway up an illuminated cotumn calibrated in thousands of 
dollars, was abandoned. The lot 
was turned into a block of experimental al fresco stores, without 
walls or roof, protected from the 
elements and casual theft by 
the new Donaldson Resistance 
Hedge, an invisible bubble of radiation that scintillated in wet 
weather with the prismatic glitter 
of oil on water. 

The center shop, alongside the 
entrance to the Pneumatique Station, was taken in 99 year lease 
by Wilson Winter, an ambivalent 
artist turned bookseller, who purchased one lot of odds and ends 
for the benefit of literature, and 
conducted a thriving trade in 
pornography for the benefit of his 



purse. Among the worthless items 
in the odds & ends was Let's Play 
Party by Nita Noyes. It collected 
dust on the shelf until it was 
bought by The Demolished Man. 

REALISM IS 4TH DIMENSION 

Y^LATON QUINN, brilliant 
young producer^of Pantys, attributes his phenomenal success 
to close attention to detail. In 
an exclusive interview with yr recarder tie said : "People forget 
that 'Panty' is slang for Emotional Pantograph. When you get 
five thousand people into a theatre to see a Panty performance, 
you can't make them feel love, 
hate, horror . . . You can't Gestalt 
them unless you put authentic detail on the Passion tape." 

Quinn, lithe and enthusiastic, 
waved his hands creatively. "Too 
many producers think that Pantys are a three-dimensional medium . . . sight, sound & sensation. To me, Pantys are four dimensional and my fourth dimension is realism. Every prop, every 
costume, every bit of cloth, metal, 
china, plastic and so on in my 
productions is authentic. And the 
public feels it. Here, look at this 

The brilliant young producer 
showed us a glittering bit of steel. 
"You won't recognize it," he 
smiled, "until you've seen Murder's Memory Bank. This is the 



S 




 



only one of its kind in existence, 
A rare French folding pistol. 
Watch." 

He pressed the gadget. There 
Was a vicious click. The steel unfolded like a flower. A stiletto 
point appeared, an explosive muzzle, and four heavy steel rings 
which, Quinn explained, were 
knuckledusters. 

"A fistful of murder," Flaton 
said enthusiastically. "Wait until 
you're in your seat at the preview. You feel the knife. You 
feet the bullet tear into your 
heart. You feel all the pain and 
horror of peril and passion. If a 
sensational. It's all in my new 
Panty, Murder's Memory Bank." 

Platon Quinn refolded the pistol, replaced it in the desk and 
forgot it. He forgot it when he 
left the hotel. It remained forgotten until it was used by The 
Demolished Man. 

* * * 

A NTI-Gravity or Nulgee was 
explored, developed and exploited. It smashed one industrial 
world and created five others. 
Among « million entrepreneurs 
scrabbling Phoenixlike in the 
ruins, it was adopted by "The 7 
Sacrament Brothers,", a singletruck moving firm owned and operated by a lone brother named 
Reich. Reich was a thin young 
man, equipped with a fishy eye, 
cannibal ambitions and a minimum of social responsibility. 



Nulgee was also adopted by; 
Space Clubs, Inc., who were having difficulty raising funds. Industry shrugged, preferring to 
leave the wild pioneering to 
fools. Who wants to speculate on 
probabilities? What commercial 
advantage can there be in reaching the arid Moon or the icy methanated planets? Who sponsored 
Cayley, Henson, Stringfellow, 
Chanute, Santos- Dumont, the 
Wrights? Also, there were stvunl 
wars pending, and the armies 
were fighting to stifle Nulgee for 
insecure reasons of security. 

Meanwhile, there was Alnn 
Courtney. After divorcing his 
twelfth wife, Courtney started 
looking around for a new kind of 
hyper-thyroid release. He had 
enough money to bore him. and 
that was enough to start building 
a starship. His statement to the 
press announced that he was off 
to search the stars for an ideal 
wife. The press was indifferent to 
Mr. Courtney and he was piqued. 
Out of spite he finished the ship, 
and out of drunkenness he took 
off. 

He never returned. No one believed he'd left. Five years later, 
most people were asking: "What 
ever happened to marrying Alan 
Courtney ?" And people were answering: "He's living in Santa Fe, 
isn't he? Married again, probably" 

There was also Glen Tuttle, a 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



renegade psychotic who fleeced 
his wife and in-laws, bilked his 
creditors, defrauded his friends, 
and, in a final attempt to jump 
out of the frying pan, constructed 
a flimsy starship on credit and 
lofted to space unknown. Tuttle 
also never returned. His escape 
was never believed. Space Clubs 
was still talking about funds for 
the first ship to carry men to the 
Moon. 

There were, in addition, Almedo Zigerra, Joan Turnbul, 
Fritz Wonchalk. Speeman Van 
Tueik and a few others . . . maladjusted, incapable of social compromise, escapists all . . . which 
is to say, pioneers all. They left 
Earth one by one with varying 
publicity, little recognition, and 
never returned. Space Clubs Inc. 
cheered the donation of $100,000 
by a transportation magnate 
named Reich, and predicted that 
man would soon leave -Earth for 
his first journey into space. It had 
already taken place. It had already produced The Demolished 
Man. 

SHE came through the door 
into the quiet consultation 
room and looked around. She was 
a drab woman, forty, faded, 
frightened. She saw the man behind the desk, a young man with 
black hair, black eyes, and Duffy's white satin skin. 

"Come in, madam. Be seated." 



His voice was low, slightly harsh, 
as though it contained conflicts 
under compression. 

"Thank you." She lowered herself painfully. "Looks too slick. 
Thief-type. Mannerly said the 
guy might be legitimate. Not a 
chance. My recorder on? Right." 

"Your name, madam?" 

"My name? Rhoda Rennsaeler, 
buster, when you read it in the 
byline. I'm Mrs. Thomas Nolles. 
Elvira is my given name." 

"And your problem, Mrs. 
Nolles?" 

"Well, I keep hearing those 
voices in my ear all the time talking to me. So I thought a doctor 
could — '* 

"I'm not a doctor, madam. Understand that. I do not practice 
medicine. I merely advise my 
friends. You may call call me 
mister. Mr. Lorry Gart." 

"Cautious, aren't you? But I'll 
get you, buster, don't ever imagine I won't." 

"Your problem, Mrs. Nolles?" 
Gart repeated. 

"It's these voices. I hear them 
telling me I'm God. And if you 
can resist that come-on, you're a 
smarter crook than I think. I can 
pay for the treatment. I've got a 
roll of bills you'll drool for, you 
cheap quack." 

"Provided by Mr. Hannerly?" 

"Oh, no. It's my savings. I — " 
She stopped short. 

Gart nodded and smiled. "Be

ginning to understand, Mrs. 
Rennsaeler?" 

"/ never said it. Never!" 

"No, of course you didn't. Nor 
your name. You do understand, 
don't you? Now let's be practical, 
Mrs. Rennsaeler. I'm not a 
quack. You won't expose me. 
You'll forget all about this episode." 

"But what in God's name are 
you?" 

"A mind-reader . . . telepath 
. . . esper. I have Extra Sensory 
Perception, Mrs. Rennsaeler — 
ESP. I still haven't decided what 
to call myself." He looked at her 
quizzically.'* "I'd welcome a suggestion from an experienced reporter." 

"The louse! Reading everything in my mind. Stop thinking! 
Why can't I stop thinking? l -He's 
listening. Like a Peeping Tom. 
Peeping. He — " , 

"Mrs. Rennsaeler, stop that!" 
Gart spoke sharply. He arose 
from his chair and stepped 
around the desk to her. "Listen 
to me. Don't be afraid. You feel 
the privacy of your shame is 
being invaded. That makes you 
hostile. But you have nothing to 
be ashamed of, Mrs. Rennsaeler. 
We're all alike inside our minds. 
All of us. I know. I've found that 
out." 

She stared up at him in terror. 
"Believe me." He nodded and 
grinned painfully. "Shall I tell 



you my shames, my secret fears 
and vices, my terrors? Shall we 
be brothers below the conscious 
threshold? My father was a criminal . . . Galen Gart Jr., a telepathic blackmailer, a cheat, a 
man who read min3s to destroy 
people. He was murdered. I have 
in me the same extra sense, the 
ability to read minds . . . not 
deeply, but deeply enough. It's an 
ability tempted by greed, vicious 
hatred of society, compulsions to 
shock and destroy people . . • 
compulsions to destroy myself." 

"I don't understand." She 
shook her head. "I don't understand at all." 

"I'm stripping myself psychologically naked for you, Mrs. 
Rennsaeler. It's my defense 
against your hostility. I'm hoping 
that you can help me become 
something more than a backstreet 
conjurer. You're experienced in 
public relations." 

"No," she said. "No. I came 
here to expose a quack. I — " 

"Listen to me. I use my ability 
to help confused people. They 
come to me . . . the poor sick 
ones ... so sick they can't discover their problems. I do only 
one thing for them. I help them 
recognize their problems. While 
they talk, I listen to their broken 
thoughts. While they wander and 
flounder in confusion, I pick out 
the pieces, the artifacts ... I 
tell them what their crisis is. I

n 



make them see it. I wrap up their 
problem in a neat parcel and 
place it in their hands. They can 
carry it to the nearest analyst 
for solution, though that's generally not necessary." 

"Then you're no quack." 

"No, Mrs. Rennsaeler, I'm not. 
And you believe me. That much 
I can read in your mind. You 
believe me and you want to help 
me. Isn't that true?" 

After a long pause she said: 
"Yes, you damned peeper. I believe you and I want to help 
you." 

Gart took her hand. "You've 
started helping me already. 
You've given me my name."

The Geoffrey Reich, first 
manned ship to reach the Moon, 
discovered Glen Tuttle's ship and 
body in the center of a seventymile bed of Haines' Stellite valued at $6.83 a pound. The airlock 
of Tuttle's ship was open and the 
body sprawled at the entrance. 
Poor Tuttle was so ignorant that 
he never knew the Moon was airless. He had had time for one 
quick glance at Mare Imbrium 
before he suffocated. His body 
was riddled with machine-gun 
perforations from the meteoric 
pellets that bombard the unprotected Moon at 30 miles per second.

MR, ASJ: Counsel may cross


examine the witness. 

MR. LECKY: If it please the 
court, at this time I would like 
to introduce Dr. Walter Clark 
E.M.D., as Esper Medical Expert to conduct the cross-examination of this hostile witness. 

MR. ASJ: Objection. 

THE'.COURT: What is your argument, Mr. Lecky? 

MR. LECKY: I submit, your 
honor, that in this Matter of 
the Estate of Alan Courtney, a 
sum exceeding twenty-five million dollars is at stake. Although I do not impugn the 
conscious honesty of my opponent's witnesses, I suggest that 
their recollection has been colored by dollar signs. 

MR. ASJ: Is counsel making an 
argument or writing a Panty 
scenario? 

MR. LECKY: It is an established fact that men remember 
what they want to remember, 
and forget what they want to 
forget. They do this in all sincerity. Objective truth does not 
exist in the psychoanalytic 
sense, and our courts have affirmed and reaffirmed the psychoanalytic principle in a long 
line of cases. 

THE COURT : This court is acquainted with the precedents, 
Mr. Lecky, but the present 
cause of action does not lie 
with them. 

MR. ASJ: There never yet hat

been a case where a peeper was 
admitted to give evidence, and 
if counsel imagines he's going 
to ring in a — 

MR. LECKY: What are you 
afraid of? If your witnesses are 
telling the truth, my man will 
peep them and confirm it. But 
if they're lying as I suggest— 

THE COURT: Gentlemen! Gentlemen! Such exchanges cannot 
be countenanced. The court is 
cognizant of the fact that 
Extra Sensory Experts perform 
valuable services for society in 
many walks of life . . . the 
Esper Medical Doctor, the 
Esper Attorney, the Esper Educator, the Esper Criminologist ... to mention only a few; 
yet the Esper Expert cannot 
properly be admitted to any 
court to give Esper evidence for 
the record. 

MR. LECKY: It cannot be ruled 
an invasion of privacy, your 
honor, any more than a snapshot of a nude sunbather can 
be ruled an invasion of modesty. Three hundred years ago 
the human body was imagined 
to be a thing of shame. Concealment was the strange custom of the day. Two hundred 
years ago, the human mind was 
imagined to be a thing of 
shame. Concealment was the 
strange custom of that time. 
But we have progressed far beyond such medieval concepts


THE COURT: Very true. Mr. 
Lecky, but human justice has 
not yet abandoned the established principle that a man 
cannot be used as a hostile 
witness against himself. A man 
cannot be forced to convict 
himself of subconscious mendacity. Justice must always remain on the objective level. If

of the deluded innocents who 
falsely believe in their own 
guilt? How would the courts 
reconcile their subjective confessions with their objective 
• innocence? The Objection is 
sustained.

TN 2300, the Sacrament III 
-1 carefully quartering the East 
Quadrant of Mars for FO (fissionable ore) discovered the remains of" marrying Alan Courtney. He had survived his landing 
some two years, eking out his 
dwindling supplies with lichens 
and the dew that formed on the 
surface of his starship. There 
were scars and rust particles on 
his tongue. 

Evidently he had gone insane, 
for they found his dessicated 
body genuflected before a rock 
on which the symbol of the Order 
of Python had been cut. 

The symbol, a serpent coiled 
in an infinity sign, was ignored 
in the reports, but they named a 
city after him. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAM 



In honor of Alan Courtney, his 
grcat-grandnephew, Samuel Dus, 
took his name, took his twentyfive million dollars and took up 
residence in Courtney City on 
Mars. 

There were other reasons. Samuel Dus-Courtney had been 
mauled in a financial scrimmage 
with old Geoffrey Reich III, and 
was retiring to lick his wounded 
bank account.

amused.

for one spectator. Silent. Staring. 
Leering. Looming. 

The Man With No Face! 

This time his scream had 
sound. 

Ben Reich awoke. 

He lay quietly in the hydropathic bed while his heart shuddered and his eyes focused at random on objects in the room. The 
walls of green jade, the nightlight in the porcelain mandarin 
whose head nodded interminabty 
if you touched him, the multiclock that radiated the time of 
three planets and nine satellites, 
the bed itself, a crystal pool flowing with carbonated glycerine at 
Speegee three and ninety-nine 
point nine Fahrenheit. 

The door opened softly and 
Jonas appeared in the gloom, a 
shadow in puce sleeping suit, a 
shade with the face of a horse 
and the bearing of an undertaker. 

"Again?" Reich asked. 

"Yes, Mr. Reich." 

"Loud?" 

"Very loud, sir. And terrified." 

"Damn your jackass ears," 
Reich growled. "I'm never 
afraid." 

"No, sir." 

"Get out." 

"Yes, sir. Good night, sir." 
Jonas stepped back and closed 
the door. 

Reich shouted: "Jonast" 

The valet reappeared. 

"Sorry, Jonas." 



"Quite all right, sir." 

"It isn't all right." Reich 
charmed him with a smile. "Next 
time I yell at you, yell right back. 
Why should I have all the fun?" 

"Oh, Mr. Reich . . ." 

"Do that and you get a raise." 
The smile again. "That's all, 
Jonas. Thank you." 

"Thank you, sir." The valet 
withdrew. 

Reich arose from the bed and 
toweled himself before the cheval 
mirror, practicing the smile. 
"Make your enemies by choice," 
he muttered, "not by accident." 
He stared at the reflection: the 
heavy shoulders, deep chest, narrow flanks, long corded legs . . . 
the sleek head with wide eyes, 
small chiseled nose, small sensitive mouth scarred by implacability. 

"Why?" he asked. "I- wouldn't 
change looks with the devil. I 
wouldn't change places with God. 
Why the screaming?" 

He put on a gown and glanced 
at the clock. It was a little after 
six. He would give himself an 
hour of analysis. The screaming 
had to stop. 

"But I'm not afraid," he said. 
"I'm never afraid." 

He stepped down a corridor, 
clacking his sandals sharply on 
the silver floor, indifferent to the 
slumber of his staff, unaware 
that this early morning skeletal 
clatter awakened twelve hearts to 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



IS 



hatred and dread. He thrust open 
the door of his analyst's suite, entered and at once lay down on 
the couch. 

Wilson Breen, E.M.D.2, was already awake and ready for him. 
As Reich's staff analyst he slept 
the 'nurse's sleep' in which he remained en rapport with his patient and e-ould instantly be 
awakened by his needs. That one 
scream had been enough for 
Breen. Now he was seated alongside the couch, elegant in embroidered gown and sharply alert, 
for his employer was generous 
but -demanding. 

"Go ahead, Mr. Reich." 

"The Man With No Face

"Nightmares?" 

"Peep me and find out! Sorry.

out . . ." There was a long pause. 
Finally Reich blurted: "Well?" 

"You persist that you cannot 
Identify The Man With No Face, 
Mr. Reich?" 

"How the hell can 1? I never 
see it. All I know is — **

guilty rage. ^ pay you twenty

"Do you mean that. Mr. Reich, 
or is it simply a part of the general anxiety syndrome?" 

"There is no anxiety," Reich 
shouted. "I'm not afraid. I'm

realizing the futility of ranting 
while the deft mind of the peeper 
searched underneath his aggressive words. "You're wrong, anyway," he said sulkily, "i don't 
know who it is. It's a man with 
no face. That's all." 

"You've been rejecting the essen ti a 1 poi nts , Mr. Reich. You

"Sears - pits - balcony - boxes staffs - horse stalls - Martian

"And there you have it, Mr.

terror in dreams that contain 
three common denominators . . . 
Finance, Transportation, and 
Mars. Over and over again . . . 
The Man With No Face, and 
Finance, Transportation and 
Mars." 

"That doesn't mean anything 
to me.'* 

"It must mean something, Mr. 
Reich. You must be able to identify this terrifying figure. Why 
else would you attempt to escape 
by rejecting his face?" 

"I'm not rejecting anything." 

"I offer as further clues the altered word 'dort* and the forgotten name of the company that 
coined the advertising slogan 'We 



Transport You Into—"* 

"I tell you I don't know who 
it is." Reich arose abruptly from 
the couch. "Your clues don't 
help. I can't make any identification." 

"The Man With No Face does 
not fill you with fear because he's 
faceless. You know who he is. 
You hate him and fear him, but 
you know who he is." 

"You're the peeper, damn you! 
You tell me!" 

"There's a limit to my ability, 
Mr. Reich. I can read your mind 
no deeper without help." 

"What do you mean, help? 
You're the best man I could hire. 
If—" 

"Mr. Reich, you deliberately 
hired a 2nd Class Esper in order 
to protect yourself in such an 
emergency. Now you're paying 
the price of your caution, If you 
want the screaming to stop, you'll 
have to consult one of the 1st 
Class men— Augustus T8 or Gart 
or Samuel @kins . . 

"I'll think about it," Reich 
muttered and turned to go. As he 
opened the door, Breen called : 
"By the way. 'We Transport You 
Into Transports' is the slogan of 
the D'Courtney Cartel. How does 
that tie in with the alteration of 
'bort* to 'dort'? Think it over." 

"The Man With No Face!" 

Without staggering, Reich 
slammed the door across the path 
from his mind to Breen and then 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



17 



lurched down the corridor toward 
his own suite. A wave of savage* 
hatred burst over him. 

"Craye D'Courtney. Tim Man 
With No Face. He's right, the 
smart son of a bitch. It's 
D'Courtney who's giving me the 
screams. Not because I'm afraid 
of him. I'm afraid of myself. 
Known all along. Known it deep 
down inside. Known that once I 
faced it I'd have to kill D'Courtney. He has no face because it's 
the face of murder." 

FT'ULLY dressed and in his 
wrong mind, Reich stormed 
i'u of his apartment and descended to the street where a Sacrament Jumper picked "him up 
and carried him in one graceful 
hop to the giant tower that 
housed the hundreds of floors and 
thousands of employees of Sacrament's New York office. 

Sacrament Tower was the central nervous system of an incredibly vast corporation, a pyramid of transportation, communication, heavy industry, manufacture, sales distribution, research, 
exploration, importation. Sacrament bought and sold, made and 
destroyed, traded and gave. Its 
pattern of subsidiaries and holding companies was so complex 
that it demanded the full-time 
services of a 2nd Class Espcr Accountant. 

ReicVi entered his office, fol


lowed by his chief (Esper 3) secretary and her staff, bearing the 
litter of the morning's work. 
"Dump it and jet," he ordered 

surlily. 

They deposited the papers and 
recording crystals on his desk and 
departed hastily but without rancor. They were accustomed to his 
rages. Reich seated himself behind his desk, trembling with a 
fury that was already goring 
D'Courtney. Finally he muttered : "1*11 give the bastard one 
more chance." 

He unlocked his desk, opened 
the drawer-safe and withdrew the 
Executive's Code Book, restricted 
to the executive heads of the firms 
listed quadruple A-1-* by 
Lloyd's, He found most of the 
material he required in the middle pages of the book:

Marking his place in the code

and said to the image of the

inter-office operator: "Get me 
Code." 

The screen dazzled and cut to 
a smoky room cluttered with 
books and coils of tape. A 
bleached man in a faded shirt 
glanced at the screen, then leaped 
to attention. 

"Yes, Mr. Reich?" 

"Morning, Hassop. You look 
like you need a vacation. Make 
your enemies by choice. Take a 
week at Ampro. Sacrament expense." 

"Thank you. Mr. Reich. Thank 
you very much." 

"This message is confidential.

Code Book. "Send YYJI TTED

"Right, Mr. Reich. VU jet." 

Reich cut off the phone. He 
jabbed his hand once into the pile 
of papers and crystals on his 
fesk, picked up a crystal and 
dropped it into the playback. His 
chief secretary's voice said: "Sacrament Gross off two point one 
one three four per cent. D'Courtney Gross up two point one one 
three oh per cent . . .*' 

"Out of my pocket into his!" 
He snapped off the playback and 
arose in an agony of impatience. 
It would take hours for the reply 
to reach Mars and return. His 



whole life hung on D'Courtney*! 
reply. 

He left his office and began to 
roam through the floors and departments of Sacrament Tower, 
pretending the remorseless personal supervision he usually exercised. His *hief secretary unobtrusively accompanied him like 
a trained dog. 

"Trained bitch!" Reich thought. 
Then, aloud: "I'm sorry. Did you 
peep that?" 

"Quite all right, Mr. Reich, I 
understand." 

"Do you? I don't. God dama 
D'Courtney!" 

In Personnel they were testing, 
checking and screening the usual 
mass of job applicants . . . clerks, 
craftsmen, specialists, middle"bracket executives, top drawer 
experts. All the preliminary elimination was done with standardized tests and interviews, and 
never to the satisfaction of Sacraments Esper Personnel chief, who 
was stalking through the floor in 
an icy rage when Reich entered. 
The fact that Reich's secretary 
sent an advance telepathic announcement of the visit made no 
difference to him. 

"I have allotted ten minutes 
per applicant for my final screening interview," the chief was 
snapping to his worried crew. 
"Six per hour. Forty-eight per 
day. Unless my percentage of 
final rejections drops below thir

It 



ty-five, I am wasting my time; 
which means that you are wasting Sacrament's time. I am not 
employed by Sacrament to screen 
out the obviously unsuitable. 
That is your work. See to it." He 
turned to Reich and nodded pedantically. "Good morning, Mr. 
Reich." 

"Morning. Trouble?" 

"Nothing that cannot be handled once this staff understands 
that Extra Sensory Perception is 
not a miracle but a skill subject 
to wage-hour requirements. What 
is your decision on Blogg, Mr. 
Reich?" 

Secretary : "He hasri t read 
your memo yet." 

"May I point out, madam, that 
unless I am used with maximum 
efficiency, I am wasted. The 
Blogg memo has been on Mr. 
Reich's desk for three days." 

"Tel! him about it now." 

"It will consume three minutes 
which will cost my department 
fifteen hundred dollars. My time 
is rated at — " 

"Tell him anyway. He's in a 
temper." 

"Who the hell is Blogg?" 
Reich asked. 

"First, the background, Mr. 
Reich: There are approximately 
one hundred thousand 3rd Class 
Espers in the Esper Guild. An 
Esper 3 can peep the conscious 
level of a mind. The 3rd can discover what a subject is thinking 



at the moment of thought. The 
3rd is the lowest class of telepaths. Most of Sacrament's security positions are held by 3rds. 
We employ over five hundred . . .** 

"For God's sake, he knows ail 
this. Everybody does. Get to the 
point, long-winded!" 

"Permit me to arrive at the 
point in my own way, madam." 

"How did you ever get into 
Personnel, gas-bag? You're m 
born bad lecture/." 

"There are approximately ten 
thousand 2nd Class Espers in the 
Guild," the Personnel chief continued frostily. "They are experts 
like myself who can penetrate 
beneath the conscious level of the 
mind to the preconscious. Moat 
2nds are in the professional class 
. . . physicians, lawyers, engineers, educators, economists, architects and so on." 

"And you cost a fortune," 
Reich growled. 

"We have unique service to 
sell. Sacrament appreciates that 
fact. Sacrament employs over one 
hundred 2nds at present." 

"Will you get to the point? If 
he wasn't so mad at D'Courtney, 
he'd have your head off by now." 

"There are less than a thousand 1 st Class Espers in the 
Guild. The lsts are capable of 
deep peeping, through the conscious and preconscious layers 
down to the unconscious, the lowest levels of the mind. Primordial 



GALAXY SClfNCE FICTION 



basic desires and so forth. These 
Espers, of course, hold premium 
positions. Education, specialized 
medical service . . . analysts like 
T8. Gart, @kins. Moselle . . . 
criminologists like Preston Powell of the Psychotic Division . . . 
Political Analysts, State Negotiators, Special Cabinet Advisers 
and so on. Thus far Sacrament 
has never had occasion to hire a 
1st." 

"And?" Reich demanded. 

"The occasion has arisen, Mr. 
Reich, and I believe Blogg may 
be available. Briefly . . ." 

"/( says here." 

"Briefly, Sacrament is hiring 
so many Espers that I have suggested we set up a special Esper 
Personnel Department", headed 
by a 1st like Blogg to devote 
itself exclusively to the work." 

"He's wondering why you can't 
handle it." 

"I have given you the background to explain why I cannot 
handle the job, Mr. Reich. I am 
a 2nd Class Esper. I can telepath normal applicants rapidly 
and efficiently, but I cannot handle other Espers with the same 
speed and efficiency. All Espers 
are accustomed to using mind 
blocks of varying effectiveness 
depending on their rating. It 
would take me one hour per 3rd 
for an efficient screening interview. It would take me three 
hours per 2nd. I could not pos


sibly peep a 1st. We must hire a 
1st like Blogg for this work. The 
cost will be large, but the necessity is urgent.* 

"What's so urgent?" Reich said. 

"For God's sake, don't give him 
that picture.' He's sore enough 
about D' Courtney ." 

"I have my job to do, madam." 
To Reich, the chief said: "We are 
not hiring the best Espers, Mr. 
Reich. The D'Courtney Cartel 
has been taking the cream of the 
Espers away from us. Over and 
over again, through lack of proper facilities, we have been tricked 
by D'Courtney into bidding for 
inferior people while D'Courtney 
has quietly appropriated the 
best." 

"God damn you!" Reich 
shout v-d. "God damn D'Courtney. All right, set it up. And tell 
this Blogg to start mouse -trapping D'Courtney. You'd better 
start, too." 

He left Personnel and went 
down to Sales, where a copycheck was being run on an audience of one hundred people 
selected at random from the 
streets. They were seated in the 
small theater, watching a test 
run of advertising copy, while the 
Esper Sales chief peeped their 
reactions and responses. Warned 
by Reich's secretary, he dropped 
his work at once and came up to 
Reich, his face perplexed and annoyed. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Morning, Mr. Reich.* 1 
^ "Morning. Trouble?" 

"Save it. Save it. Don't spill 
anything" 

"Got to, girlie. It's a crisis." 

"Bub, you only think it's a 
crisis. The boss is — " 

"I wish you could peep that 
audience, Mr. Reich. How does 
D'Courtney do it?" 

"Do what?" 

"Build that hostility toward 
us." The Sales chief waved at the 
people in the chairs. "They think 
all our products are shoddy substitutes for D'Courtney's. They 
think every bit of our copy is an 
outrageous lie. That damned 
Cartel's instilled patriotism ! 
They feel it'd be an act of treachery to settle for anything less 
than D'Courtney." 

"Who's handling their Public 
Relations? Whoever if. is, get 
him." 

"He's a she, Mr. Reich," the 
secretary said. "An Esper 2. And 
incorruptible." 

"Who said anything about corruption ?" 

"You didn't say it, Mr. Reich, 
but we tried." 

"I'll fix him!" Reich shouted. 

He stormed up to Propaganda, 
where the department chief was 
rapidly peeping a battery of fieldresearchers, all 3rds, all back 
from Continental Africa, and all 
- apparently with discouraging 
news. 

72 i 



"Morning," Reich interrupted. 
"Trouble?" 

The Propaganda chief ignored 
the secretary's warning and 
nodded dismally. "Let's face it," 
he said. "We're being licked." 
"D'Courtney?" 

"D'Courtney. You name any 
place on any planet or satellite, 
and that's where D'Courtney's 
the Great White Father. If Sacrament tried to give anything 
away, they'd refuse to accept." 

"We're -dropping all campaigns 
as of now. Never mind whitewashing Sacrament. Start mudslinging D'Courtney. I want 
smear. Attack him. Villify him. 
He robs banks. He rapes widoi 
He cheats orphans. He — " 

"Got your picture," the pee 
interrupted. "What about sla 
der?" 

"Who gives a damn for th 
law? Let him sue. He'll 
smeared by the time he gets 
court. Pass the word for Legal 
meet in my office." 

Reich returned to his offi" 
where the Legal chief, forewarned 
by the lightning telepathic grapevine, was already waiting with 
Reich's picture in his mind. 

"You can't do it, Mr. Reich," 
he said. "D'Courtney'll sue and 
collect." 

"One way or another, D'Courtney'll bust Sacrament wide Open 
if we don't fight. Go peep Accounting for the picture." 


 



"I've got the picture from you, 
nr." 

"Then get back to your department and start preparing a defense. Propaganda's going to start 
a full campaign . . , whisper, 
©vert, blatant. I'm using an old 
fighting trick. If you can't attack 
the argument, attack the man. I 
want D'Courtney attacked, legally and illegally. You're forewarned. We're going to break a 
few laws . . .'* 

"A few hundred." 

"All right. Hit D'Courtney 
with suits before he hits us. Accuse him of everything we're going to do to him. Start every civil 
and criminal action against him 
that we'll be guilty of. This is a 
fight for survival. Pass the word 
and get the hell out of here." 

After the Legal chief was gone, 
Reich paced in a fury for five 
minutes. "It's no use," he muttered. "I know I'll have to kill 
the bastard. He won't accept. 
Why should he accept? He thinks 
he's licked me. Damn him, he has 
licked me. All this is just loud 
talk. I'll have to kill him. And 
I'll need some real help . . . peeper 
help." 

He flipped on the phone and 
told the operator: 
"Relations." 

A sparkling lounge appeared 
on the screen, decorated in 
chrome and enamel, equipped 
with game tables and a bar dis


penser. It appeared to be and 
was used as a recreation center. 
It was, in fact, headquarters of 
Sacrament's powerful espionage 
division. The Recreation director, 
a bearded scholar named West, 
looked up from a chess problem, 
then leaped to attention. 

"Good morning, Mr. Reich." 

Warned by the formal 'Mister' 
Reich said: "Good morning, Mr. 
West. Just a routine check. Paternalism, you know. How's 
amusement these days?" 

"Modulated, Mr. Reich. However, I must complain. I think 
there's entirely too much gambling going on." West stalled in 
a fussy voice until two bona fide 
Sacrament clerks innocently finished their drinks and departed. 
Then he relaxed and slumped 
into his chair. "All clear, Ben. 
Shoot." 

"Has Hassop broken the confidential code yet, Ellery?" 

THE peeper shook his head 
bitterly, 
"Trying?" 

West smiled and nodded. 
"Where's D'Courtney?" 
"En route to Terra, aboard the 
Astra." 

"Know his plans? Where he'll 
be staying?" 

"No. Want a check?" 

"I don't know. It depends . . .** 

"Depends on what?" West 
glanced at him curiously. "I wish

the Telepathic Pattern could be 
transmitted by phone, Ben. I'd 
like to know what you're driving 
at." 

Reich smiled grimly. "Thank 
God for the phone. It protects us 
from TP invasion. What's your 
personal attitude toward crime, 
Ellery?" 

"Typical." 

"Of anybody?" 

"Of the Esper Guild. The 
Guild doesn't like it, Ben." 

"You're a sharp character, 
Ellery. You know the value of 
money, success. Why don't you 
clever up? Why do you let the 
Guild do your thinking?" 

"You don't understand. We're 
born in the Guild. We live with 
the Guild. We die in the Guild. 
We have the right to elect Guild 
officers, and that's all. The Guild 
runs our professional lives. It 
trains us, grades us, sets ethical 
standards and sees that we stick 
to them. It protects us by protesting the layman. Same as medical associations. We have the 
equivalent of the Hippocratic 
Oath. It's called the Galen 
Pledge. God help any of us if 
we break it ... as I judge you're 
suggesting I should." 

"Maybe I am," Reich said intently. "Maybe I'm hinting it

Class peeper would see in a lifetime." 

"Forget it, Ben. Not interested." 

"So bust your pledge. What 
happens?" 

"We're ostracized." 

"Smart peepers have broken 
with the Guild before. They've 
been ostracized. What of it?" 

WEST smiled wryly. "You 
wouldn't understand, Ben." 
"Make me understand." 
"Those peepers you mention, 
like Jeremy Church. They weren't 
so smart. It's like this . . ." West 
considered. "Before surgery really 
got started, there used to be a 
handicapped group called deafmutes." 

"No-hear no-talk?" 
"That's it. They communicated 
by a manual sign language. That 
meant they couldn't communicate with anybody but deafmutes. Understand? They had to 
live in their own community or 
they couldn't live at all. A man 
goes crazy if he can't have 
friends." 
"So?" 

"Some of them started a racket. They'd tax the more successful deaf-mutes for weekly handouts. If the victim refused to pay, 
they'd ostracize him. The victim 
always paid. It was a choice of 
paying or living in solitary until 
he went mad." 




 



"You mean you peepers are 
like deaf-mutes?" 

"No, Ben. You non-Espers are 
the deaf-mutes. If we had to live 
with you alone, we'd go mad. 
Now for God's sake, leave me 
alone. I've got work to do. If 
you're planning something dirty, 
I don't want to know." 

West cut off the phone in 
Reich's face. With a roar of rage, 
Reich snatched up a gold paperweight and hurled it into the 
crystal screen. Before the shattered fragments finished flying, 
he slammed the door of his office 
and was on his way out of the 
building. 

TTiS secretary knew where he 
was going. His peeper chauffeur knew 'where he wanted to 
go. Reich arrived in his apartment and was met by his peeper 
house -supervisor, who at once announced early luncheon and 
tuned the meal to Reich's unspoken demands. Feeling slightly 
less violent, Reich stalked into 
his study and turned to his safe, 
which was a mere shimmer of 
light in the corner. 

It was simply a honeycomb 
paper rack tuned out of temporal 
phase with a single-cycle beat. 
Once a second, when the safe 
phase and temporal phase coincided, the rack pulsed with a 
brilliant glow. The safe could be 
•witched back into full temporal 



phase only by the pore-pattern 
of Reich's right index finger, 
which was irreproduceable. 

Reich placed the tip of his 
finger in the center of the glow. 
It faded and the honeycomb rack 
appeared. Holding his finger in 
place, he reached up and took 
down a small black notebook and 
a large red envelope clearly lettered; TO BE OPENED IN CASE OF 
MURDER. 

He removed his index finger 
and the safe pulsed out of temporal phase again. 

Reich flipped through the 
pages of the notebook . . . abduction . . . ABORTION . . . ANARCHISTS . . . ARSONISTS . . . BRIBERY 
AND CORRUPTION (ALREADY) . , . 
BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION (POSSIBLE) . . . Under possible, he 
found the names of fifty-seven 
prominent people. One of them 
was Augustus T8, Esper Medical 
Doctor I. He nodded with satisfaction. 

He tore open the red envelope 
and examined^ its contents. It 
contained five sheets of closely 
written pages in a handwriting 
that was centuries old. Four of 
the pages were lettered: plan A, 

PLAN B, PLAN C, PLAN D. The fifth 

was headed introduction. Reich 
read the ancient spidery script 
slowly : 

To those who come after me: 

The test of intellect is the refusal

to belabor the obvious. If you have 
opened this letter, we already understand each other. 1 have prepared four 
general murder plans which may help 
you. I bequeath them to you as part 
of the Reich inheritance. They are only 
outlines. The detail., must be tilled in 
by yourself as your time and necessity 
require 

But remember this: The essence of 
murder never changes. It is always 
the conflict of the killer against society 
with the victim as the prize. And tbo 
ABC of conflict with society never 
changes. Be audacious, be brave, he 
confident and you will not fail. Against 
these qualities society has no defense. 

Geoffrey Reich 

Reich leafed through the plans 
slowly, speculatively, filled with 
admiration for the great old pirate who had had the forethought 
and ingenuity to perform this 
work for his descendants. His 
imagination kindled and ideas 
began forming and crystalizing to 
be considered, discarded and instantly replaced. 



OAIAXY SCI IN CI FICTION 



One remarkable phrase caught 
his attention : If you are a natural 
killer, don't plan too carefully. 
Leave most to your instinct. Intellect may fail you, but the killer's instinct is infallible. 

"The killer's instinct," Reich 
breathed. "By God, I've got 
that." 

The phone chimed once and 
then the automatic switched on. 
There was a quick chatter and 
tape began to stutter out of the 
recorder. Reich strode to the desk 
and examined it. 

The message was very short 
»nd very deadly: 

CODE TO REICH: REPLY WWHG. 

"Offer refused. I knew it. I 
knew it!" Reich gritted. "All 
right, D'Courtney. If you won't 
let it be merger, then it's going 
to be murder." 

Ill 

A UGUSTUS T8, E.M.D.l, re•*» ceived $1,000 per hour of 
analysis — not a high fee considering that you rarely required 
more rtian an hour of the doctor's 
devastating time — but it placed 



his income at $8,000 a day, $40,000 a week, or $2 million a year. 
The public knew his income, but 
it did not know what proportion 
of that income was paid into the 
Esper Guild for the education of 
other Espers and the furthering 
of the Guild's long-range eugenic 
plan to bring Extra Sensory Perception to every person in all the 
worlds. 

Augustus T8 knew, and the 
95% he paid was a sore point 
with him. Because of it, he was 
not fully reconciled to the Galen 
Pledge. Almost, but not quite. It 
was the "not quite" that placed 
him in Ben Reich's bribery and 
corruption (possible) category. 

Reich marched into T8's overpowering consultation room, 
glanced once at T8's tiny figure, 
slightly out of proportion, carefully realigned by tailors, then 
sat down and grunted: 

"Peep me quick." 

He glared in concentration at 
T8 while the elegant little peeper 
examined him with a glittering 
eye and spoke in quick staccato 
bursts : 

"You're Ben Reich of Sacrament. Ten billion dollar firm. You 
think I should know you. I do. 



"A 1st Class Esper? Am I 
supposed to believe it? Am I supposed to believe you're incapabte 
of outwitting the whole world?" 

T8 smiled. "Sugar for the fly," 
he said. "A characteristic device 
of—" 

"Peep me," Reich interrupted. 
"It'll save time. Read what's in 
my mind. Your gift. My resources. An unbeatable combination. My God, it's lucky for the 
Solar System I'm willing to stop 
at one murder!" 

"No," T8 said with decision. 
" U r won't do. I'll have to commit 
you, Mr. Reich." 

"Wait. Want to find out why 
that - payment thought was 
cloudy? Read me deeper. How 
much am I willing to pay ? 
What's my top limit?" 

*T18 closed his eyes. His mannequin face tightened painfully. 
Then his eyes opened in surprise. 
"You can't be serious!" he exclaimed. 

"I am," Reich grunted. "And 
what's more, you know it's an 
offer in good faith, don't you?" 

T8 nodded slowly. 

"And you're aware that Sacrament plus D'Courtney can make 
the offer good." 

"I almost believe you." 

"You can believe me. I throw 
my combined resources at your 
disposal. I guarantee to satisfy 
every whim,' every desire, every 



You're involved in a death struggle with the D'Courtney Cartel. 
You're savagely hostile toward 
D'Courtney. Offered merger this 
morning. Offer refused. In desperation you have resolved to — " 
T8 broke off abruptly. 

"Go ahead," Reich said. 

"To murder Craye D'Courtney 
as the first step in taking over his 
cartel. You need my help. You 
offer me — that thought's vague." 

"One million dollars. In secret. 
Tax free. Guild free." 

"Ridiculous." 

"Peep me. What's in my 
pocket?" 

"Five uncut emeralds valued at 
twenty thousand dollars each. If 
you keep on like this. Mr. Reich, 
I'll have to commit you."^ 

"One hundred thousand dollars down payment. Untraceable. 
Yours." 

Reich withdrew the stones 
from his pocket and tossed them 
on the desk, where they rolled 
like cloudy green pebbles. T8 
stared at them. 

"One hundred thousand a week 
for ten weeks. The murder can't 
take any longer. No record. No 
implication. All safe. Still thinking of committing me?" 

"It can't be done," T8 said, 
hungrily not touching the cold 
stones. 

"It can be done with your 
help." 

"I can do nothing to help you."

inclination you may have for the 
rest of your life. Read me. Am I 
sincere? Will I hold to my 
word?" 

"You will," T8 admitted with 
extreme reluctance. 

"Will you accept or commit? 
And don't forget ... I can fight 
a committal. Don't ever imagine 
I can't." 

"The bribe is too big," T8 said, 
his face beginning to strain again. 
"You can't possibly hate D' Courtney with that much ferocity. I'm 
trying to discover why the bribe 
is too big." 

"Don't bother. I'll tell you. 
You want to enjoy the world. I 
want to own the world. So long 
as I own it, I'm willing to let you 
enjoy it." 

T8 picked up the stones and 
fingered them. He closed his eyes 
and said: "There hasn't been a 
successful premeditated murder 
in 79 years. Espers make it impossible to conceal intent before 
the murder. Or, if Espers have 
been evaded before the murder, 
they make it impossible to conceal the guilt." , 

"Esper evidence isn't admitted 
in court." 

'TT1RUE, but once an Esper discovers the guilt he can 
uncover objective evidence to 
support his peeping. Powell, the 
Prefect of the Psychotic Division, is deadly." T8 opened his 



eyes. "Do you want your emeralds back?" 

"No," Reich said. "Look the 
situation over with me first. Murders have always failed because 
no killer had the sense to hire a 
good peeper, or at least, if he 
had the sense, he couldn't afford 
the deal. I can.** 

"Yes, you can." 

"I'm going to fight a war," 
Reich continued. "I'm going to 
fight one sharp skirmish with society. Let's look at it as a problem in strategy and tactics. My 
problem's that of any army. 
Audacity, bravery and confidence 
aren't enough; An army, needs 
Intelligence. A war is won with 
Intelligence. I need you for my 
G-2." 

"Agreed." 

"I'll do the fighting. You'll procure the Intelligence. I'll have to 
know where D'Courtney will be, 
where I can strike, when I can 
strike. I'll take care of the killing 
myself, but you'll have to tell me 
when and where the opportunity 
will be." 

"Understood." 

"I'll have to invade first . . . 
cut through a defensive network 
surrounding D'Courtney. That 
means reconnaissance from you. 
You'll have to run interference, 
check the normals, spot the peepers, warn me and block them if 
I can't avoid them. You'll -have 
to remain on the scene after the

at 



murder. Youll find out whom 
the police suspect and why. If 
I know suspicion is directed 
against myself, I can divert it. If 
I know it's directed against someone else, I can clinch it. I can 
fight this war and win this war 
with your Intelligence. Is that 
the truth? Peep me." 

After a long pause, T8 said: 
"It's the truth. We can do it* 
He picked up the emeralds and 
dropped them into his pocket 
with finality. "There's to be a 
social gathering tonight at Preston Powell's house. D'Courtney's 
physician will be there. I'll start 
the reconnaissance. Maybe I'll 
locate D'Courtney's plans and 
destination for you. I think I 
can." 

"And you're not afraid of the 
deadly Powell'?" 

T8 smiled contemptuously. "If 
I were, Mr. Reich, would I trust 
myself in this bargain with you? 
Make no mistake, I'm ho Jeremy 
Church." 

"Church!" 

"Yes. The Esper 2nd. He was 
kicked out of the Guild ten years 
ago for that little junket of his 
with you." 

"Damn you. Got that from me, 
eh?" 

"You and history." 

"Well, it won't repeat itself this 
time. You're tougher and smarter 
than Church. Need anything special for Powell's party? Women? 



Clothes? Jewels? Money?" 

"Nothing, thank you." 

"Criminal but generous, that's 
me." Reich smiled as he arose to 
go. He did not offer to shake 
hands. 

"Mr. Reich!" T8 called suddenly. 

Reich turned at the door. 

"The screaming will continue. 
The Man With No Face is not a 
symbol of D'Courtney or murder." 

"What? Oh, Christ, the nightmares. Still? How did you get 
that? How did you — H 

"Don't be a fool. Do you think, 
you can play games like that with 
a 1st?" 

"What about the damned 
nightmares?" 

"No, I shan't tell you. I doubt 
if anyone but a 1st can tell you, 
and naturally you would not dare 
to consult another after this conference." 

"For God's sake, man! Are you 
going to help me?" 

"No, Mr. Reich," T8 smiled 
malevolently. "That's my little 
weapon. It keeps us on a parity 
basis. Criminal but peeper . . . 
that's me." 

LIKE all upper grade Espers, 
Preston Powell, Ph.D.l, lived 
in a private house. It was not a 
question of conspicuous consumption, but rather a problem 
of privacy. Life in any multiple

OALAXr SCIENCE FICTION 



dwelling was life in an inferno 
of naked emotion for an Esper, 
especially an Esper 1st. 

Powell occupied a small limestone maisonette on Hudson 
Ramp, overlooking the North 
River. There were only four 
rooms — upstairs, a bedroom and 
study; downstairs, a living room 
and kitchen. The interior walls 
were translucent nacre, at present colored oyster white with 
scounces, mouldings and Adam 
mantles projected on them. The 
polymorph furniture was currently shaped into Sheraton and 
Hepplewhite reproductions. All 
Espers required frequent sensory 
rcstimulation, and he was now 
in his Georgian period. 

There was no servant in the 
house; he preferred to do for himself. He was in the kitchen, checking over the stasis-freeze in preparation for the party, whistling 
a plaintive, crooked tune, a slender man in his late thirties, tall, 
loose, slow-moving. His cropped 
hair was prematurely white; a 
startling contrast to the jet black 
eyebrows and deep dark eyes. His 
nose was _big, thrusting, almost 
arrogant. His wide mouth seemed 
perpetually on the verge of laughter. 

If you looked at the lower half 
of Powell's face, you said this 
must be the funniest man in the 
world. If you looked at the upper 
half, you were sure he was the 



saddest man in the world. If you 
asked him, he would answer that 
he was both or neither or anything, depending on the situation, 
the questioner and the reason for 
the question. 

For it was the essence of the 
Esper that 1 he, too, was polymorph ... a personality of many 
shapes and many quantities. 
There was no consistent public 
character; there was only consistent response to the requirements of all situations. Sensitive 
to the demands of the psyche, 
the Esper gave you the response 
you really wanted and it was this 
responsive quality that made Espers fantastically popular. Layman pursued them endlessly, offering friendship and fraternity, 
marriage and maternity; and the 
Espers fled desperately, unable to 
explain to the deaf-mutes that 
these were unilateral offers . . . 
that there could be no genuine 
relationship between all-giver 
and all-taker . . . that only Espers 
could give to each other with any 
sort of equality.

"But you're asking more than 
either of us could give. If we were 
non-Espers, we might make it

Her hands became tight fists 
pressing against her hips. 

He shook his head. "You see, 
Mary? You're loathing yourself 
ior being an Esper, envying deal

"But it I became a 1st . . 

The doorbell chimed. Powell 
looked at Mary helplessly. 
"Guests," he murmured and directed Open in C-sharp at the TP 
lock-senser. At the same instant 
she directed Close a fifth above. 
The harmonics meshed and the 
door remained shut. 

"Answer me first, Pres." 

"I can't give you the answer 
you want, Mary." 

The doorbell chimed again. 

"For God's sake, be honest. Say 
it" 

He took her shoulders firmly, 
held her close and looked deep 
into her eyes. "You're a 2nd. 
Read me as deeply as you can. 
What's in my heart? Whafs in 
my mind?" 

He removed all blocks. The 
thundering, plunging depths of 
his mind cascaded over her in a 
warm, frightening, exalted torrent, terrifying, yet magnetic and 
desirable; but . . . 

"Snow. Mint. Tulips. Taffeta," 
she said wearily. "Co meet your 
guests, Pres. I'll make your canapes. It's all I'm good for." 

He kissed her once, with compassion, then turned toward the 
living room and opened the front 
door. 

Instantly a fountain of telepathic brilliance sparkled into the 
house, followed by the guests. 

The Esper party began.

laughter when Mary Noyes 
was left hanging with that un•eticulated "yet." She blushed 
with embarrassment and fought 
to conceal the wave of shame and 
humiliation linked with Powell's 
rejection that swept up from the 
lower levels of her mind. 

Fortunately, the doorbell 
chimed again, and Alan Seaver 
(Solar Equity Advocate 2) entered with a girl. She was a demure little thing, surprisingly 
attractive outwardly, and new to 
the company. Her Thought Pattern was naive and not deeply 
responsive. Obviously a 3rd. 

"Abject apologies for the delay.

"1 forgot," she blurted again, 
and then heated the room with

Seaver glare d at her, Powell 
stepped forward, took the girl's 
trembling hand and flooded her 
mind with warm acceptance. 

"Ignore him, Helen. He's a 2ndcome-latety snob. I'm Preston

"Th-thank — / mean, thank

In one lightning TP broadcast, 
Powell and @kins engaged in 
comedy mental combat for the 
girl's favors, while Seaver served 
them with summonses "and Sally 
rubbed two Boy Scouts together 
to set both rivals on fire and destroy them. The girl giggled and 
began to relax.

Young Galen Chervil indignantly started to point out that 
he'd just been classed 2nd and 
hadn't needed to use words in 
over a year. Powell cut him off 
below the girl's perceptive threshold and explained the reason for 
the deliberate mistake — he didn't 
want her to feel lost among all 
2nds and Ists. 

"Oh," said Galen, "Yep, brother and sister 3rds, that's us, Miss

These deep peepers were beginning to scare me." 

"I was scared at first, but I'm

"And this is your hostess,

"Hello, Helen. Canapes?" 

"Thank you. They look delicious, Mrs. Powell." 



"Now how about a game?" 
Powell interposed quickly. "Anybody feel like playing Rebus?" 

TTUDDLED in the shadow of 
the limestone arch, Jeremy 
Church pressed against the garden door of Powell's house, listening with all his soul. He was cold, 
silent, immobile and starved. He 
was resentful, hating, contemptuous and starved. He was an Esper 
Bar 2 and starved. The bar sinister of ostracism was the source 
of his hunger. 

Through the thin maple panel 
filtered the multiple Thought 
Pattern of the party, a weaving, 
ever-changing, exhilarating design. And Church, Esper Bar 2, 
living on a diet of words for the 
past ten years, was starved for 
his real communication. 

"The reason I mentioned 
D'Courtney is that I've just comm 
across a case that might be similar." 

That was T8, sucking up t» 
@kins. 

"Oh, really? Very interesting;, 
I'd like to compare notes. Too 
bad D'Courtney won't — well, fee 
available." @kins was being discreet and it smelled as though 
T8 was after something. Maybe 
not, but there certainly was some 
elegant block and counter- blocking going on, like duelists fencing 
with complicated electrical circuits. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



"Look here, Al, I think you've 
been pretty snotty to that poor 
girl." 

Powell, who'd had him ostracized, preaching down his big 
nose at the lawyer. 

"Poor girl? You wean dumb 
girl, Pres. My God! How gauche 
can you get?" 

"She's only a 3rd, Al. Be fair.**

"Don't be a romantic ass, Pres. 
We've got to marry peepers. I 
may as well settle for a pretty 
face." * 

They were playing Rebus in 
the living room. The Noyes girl 
was busy building a camouflaged

What the devil was that? An 
eye in a glass? Not a glass. A 
stein. Eye in a stein. Einstein. 
Easy. 

(i What d'you think of Powell 
for the job, Ellery?" That was 
Chervil with his phony smile and 
his pontifical belly. 

"For Guild President?" 

"Yes." 

"Damned efficient man. Romantic but efficient. The perfect 
candidate if he'd only get married." 

"That's the romance in him. 
He's having trouble locating a 
girl." 

"Don't all you deep peepers? 
Thank God I'm not a 1st." 

And then a smash of glass 
crashing in the kitchen and 
Preacher Powell again, lecturing 
little T8. 

"Never mind the glass, Gus. I 
had to drop it to co^er for you. 
You're radiating anxiety like an 
FO star." 

"The hell I am, Powell." 

"The hell you're not. What's 
all this about Ben Reich?" 

The little swine was really terrified. You could feel it blazing 
under the block he quickly 
erected. . 

"Ben Reich? What brought 
Nm up?" 

"You did, Gus. It's been moiling in your preconscious all evening. I couldn't help latching on 
to it" 



/ **/Vo^ me, Powell. You must bm

Image of a horse laughing. 
"Powell, I swear I'm not — " 
"Are you mixed up with Reich, 

Gus?" 

"No." But you could feel the 
blocks bang down solidly into 
place. 

"Well, take a hint from an old 
hand. Reich can get you into 
trouble. Be careful. Remember 
Jerry Church? Reich ruined him. 
Don't let it happen to you." 

The pigmy skedaddled and 
Preacher Powell remained in the 
kitchen, calm and slow-moving, 
sweeping up broken glass while 
Church lay frozen against the 
back door, suppressing the hatred, 
seething in his heart. The Chervil 
boy was showing off for the lawyer's girl, singing a love ballad 
and paralleling it with a visual 
parody. College stuff. The wives 
were arguing violently in sine 
curves. @kins and West were interlacing cross-conversation in a 
fascinatingly intricate pattern of 
sensory images that made his 
starvation keener. 

"Would you like a drink, 
Jerry?" 

The garden door opened. Powell stood silhouetted in the light, 
a bubbling glass in his hand. The 
stars lit his face softly. The deep 
hooded eyes were compassionate and understanding. Dazed, 
Church climbed to his feet and

timidly look the proffered drink. 

"Don't report this to the Guild. 
Vd catch hell for breaking the 
taboo. Poor Jerry . . . We've got 
to do sometliing for you. Ten 
years is too long." 

Church hurled the drink in 
Powell's face, then turned and 
fled, weeping invisible tears of 
anger and self-pity. 

IV 

AT nine the next morning, T8*s 
mannequin face appeared on 
the screen of Reich's phone. 

"Is this line secure?" he asked 
sharply. 

Reich pointed to the Warranty 
Seal. 

"All right," T8 said. "I think 
V ve done the j ob for you. I 
peeped (S>kins last night. Before I 
report. I must warn you — there's 
a chance of error when you deeppeep a 1st. @kins blocked pretty 
carefully." 

"He would, of course." 

"Craye D' Courtney arrives 
from Mars on the Astra next 
Wednesday morning. He will go 
at once to the home of Maria 
Beaumont, where he will be a 
secret and hidden guest for exactly one night." 

"One night," Reich repeated. 
"And then? His plans?" 

"I don't know. Apparently 
D'Courtney is planning some 
form of drastic action — " 



"Against me!" 

"Perhaps. According to @kins, 
D'Courtney is under some kind 
of violent strain and his adaptation pattern is shattering. The 
Life Instinct and Death Instinct 
have defused. He is regressing 
under the emotional bankruptcy 
very rapidly . . 

"My life depends on this,** 
Reich raged. "Talk straight." 

"Every man is a balance of 
two opposed drives — the Life Instinct and the Death Instinct. 
Both drives have the identical 
purpose, to win Nirvana. The 
Life Instinct fights for Nirvana 
by smashing all opposition. The 
Death Instinct attempts to win 
Nirvana by destroying itself. 
Usually both instincts flW in 
the adapted individual. Under 
strain, they defuse. That's what's 
happening to D'Courtney." 

"Yes. by God! And he's jetting 
for me!" 
v "@kins will see D'Courtney 
Thursday morning in an effort to 
dissuade him from whatever he 
contemplates.* @kins is afraid of 
it and determined to stop it." 

"He won't have to stop it. I'll 
stop it myself. It's self-dt ftnse, 
T8,.not murder! You've done a 
good job." 

"This is Monday. "You'll have 
to be ready by Wednesday." 

"I'll be ready," Reich assured 
him grimly. "You'd better be 
ready too." 




 



"I've reconsidered," T8 said. 
"This is as far as I care to go." 
' "The hell you say." 

"I've given you your essential 
information. Your Intelligence, 
you called it. I've been paid. 
We'll call it quits." 

"Look," Reich said ominously. 
"I can't swing it alone and you 
know it. That was the understanding. I need you to cover for 
me at Maria Beaumont's house 
next Wednesday. I'll need you for 
the cops afterward. I told you it 
was a ten week job. One day for 
the kill and sixty-nine days to 
cover." 

"I'm sorry." T8 said. *'I can't 
do it." 

"You don't know how sorry 
you're going to be," Reich answered. He flipped the Warranty 
Seal and it clattered off the line. 
It was really an astonishing counterfeit, and the mere possession 
of it could make extraordinary 
difficulties if reported to the government. Reich pointed to the recording crystal. '"Want to hear 
the playback?" 

T8's face turned livid. "You 
contemptible fool! You recorded 
this conversation? You — " 

"It'll stay recorded until we've 
finished the job. Then I'll send 
you the crystal and a hammer." 

"If the police ever — it'll mean 
Demolition. Don't you realize 
that?" 

"Demolition for both of us. 



Yes, I realize that." Reich's voice 
began to crack. "You little louse! 
Do you think I'm going to let 
anything stand between me and 
that bastard's blood? Anything?" 
He managed to take hold of himself. "You're in this all the way 
with me, and I'm in it straight 
to the finish . . . one way or the 
other. Don't forget the strain I'm 
under. I'm starting to defuse 
too." 

DEICH planned all that Monday, audaciously, bravely, 
with confidence. He planned as 
a story is plotted or a song is 
sketched. He penciled the outlines 
as an artist fills a sheet with delicate tracery before the bold inking-in; but he did no final inking. 
That was to be left for the- killerinstinct on Wednesday night. He 
put the plan away and slept Monday night . . . and awoke screaming, dreaming of The Man With 
No Fact. 

But Tuesday morning he reexamined the plan and was satisfied. It was audacious, brave, 
confident. One trick to make himself invisible for the attack on 
D'Courtney; one time-machine to 
banish all defense out of the continuum: one ingenious deception 
to rob all peepers of their dangerous telepathic perception; one 
final, inexplicable murderous 
blow to destroy his enemy forever. 



HE DEMOLISHED MAN 



Tuesday afternoon, Reich left 
Sacrament Tower early and 
dropped in at the Winter Studios 
on Sheridan Place. A two-century zigzag progression led from 
the old book store via: pornographic literature — pornographic 
Pantys — legitimate Pantys — industrial Pantys — industrial research — -planetary research — and 
Planetary Conditioning to the 
giant block of buildings where 
would-be colonists were inducted 
and trained for survival in the 
strange new environments which 
they would encounter. 

"I'm trying to survive too," 
TJeich muttered. "But I'm already conditioned for it." 

For sentimental reasons, the 
old Winter book store was still 
maintained in an alley between 
two of the colossal buildings. It 
also served as a space and light 
saver, and was a quaint landmark with its ancient Donaldson 
Resistance Hedge, ft specialized 
mostly in pi ezo -electric recordings, tiny crystals mounted in 
elegant settings. The latest vogue 
was brouehe-operas for M'lady. 
("She Shall Have Music Wherever She Goes.") Winter also had 
shelves of fascinating old books. 

"I want scmethin™ special for a 
nd I've neglected," Reich told 

V ' c 'lCTm '■■ ■,: .'. f' 

He was iif mediately bombarded with merchandise and 
suggestions. 



"Not special enough," he complained. "Why don't you people 
hire a peeper and save your clients this trouble?" He began 
sauntering around the shop, 
tailed by a retinue of eager clerics. 
After he had dissembled sufficiently, and before the worried 
manager could send out for an 
emergency peeper salesman, 
Reich stopped before the bookshelves. 

"What's this?" he inquired, 
looking surprised. 

"Antique books, Mr. Reich.** 
The sales staff began explaining 
what books were and how they 
used to be produced, while Reich 
slowly examined his way toward 
the tattered brown volume that 
was his goal. He remembered it 
well. He had glanced through it 
five years ago and made a note 
of one particular device in his little black opportunity book. Old 
Geoffrey Reich wasn't the only 
Reich who believed in preparedness. 

"Interesting. What's this one?" 
Reich pulled down the brown 
volume. "Let's Play Party by 
Shirley Noyes. What's the date 
on it? You mean to say they had 
parties that long ago?" 

The staff assured him that the 
ancients were very modern in 
many astonishing ways. 

"Look at the contents," Reich 
chuckled. " 'Honeymoon Bridge' 
. . . 'Prussian Whist' . . . 'Post 



49 




 



Office* . . . *Sardine\ What in the 
world could that be? Page ninetysix. Let's have a look." 

Reich flipped pages until he 
came to a bold-face heading: 
HILARIOUS games. "Look at this," 
he laughed, pointing to the wellremembered paragraph. 

SARDINE 
One player is selected to be It. AU 
the lights are extinguished and the It 
hides anywhere in the house. After a 
few minutes, the players go to hnd the 
It, hunting separately. The first one 
who finds him does not reveal the fact, 
but hides with him wherever he is. 
Successively, each player finding the 
Sardines joins them until all are hidden in one place and the last player 
who is the loser is left to wander alone 
in the dark. 

"I'll take it," Reich said. "This 
is just the thing for mu — for my 
friend." 

rX^HAT evening he spent three 

hours carefully defacing the 
remains of the volume. With heat, 
acid, stain and scissors, he mutilated the game instructions, and 
every burn, every cut, every slash 
was a blow at D'Courtney's 
writhing body. When his proxy 
murders were finished, he had reduced every game to incomplete 
fragments. Only 'Sardine' was left 
intact. 

Reich wrapped the book, addressed it to <try, the appraiser, 
and dropped it into the airslot. It 
went off with a puff and a bang 



and returned an hour later with 
^try's official sealed appraisal. 
Reich's mutilations had not been 
suspected of being anything but 
the deterioration of ages. 

He had the book gift-wrapped 
with the appraisal enclosed, as 
was the custom, and slotted it to 
Maria Beaumont's house. Twenty minutes later came the reply, 
obviously written by herself: 

"Darling! I thot you'd forgotten litle ol sexy me. How 2 divine. Come to Beaumont House 
tonite. Were haveing a party. 
We'l play games from you're 
sweet gift." There was a portrait 
of Maria centered in the star of 
a synthetic ruby enclosed in the 
message capsule. 

Reich answered: "Devastated. 
Not tonight. One of my millions 
is missing." 

She answered: "Wenesday, you 
clever boy, I'll give you one 
of mine." 

He replied: "Delighted to accept. Will bring guest. I kiss all 
of yours." He went to bed. 

And screamed at The Man 
With No Face. 

WEDNESDAY morning, 
Reich visited the laboratory 
department of Sacrament — "Paternalism, you know" — and spent 
a stimulating hour with the bright 
young men. He discussed their 
work and their glowing futures 
if they would only have faith in 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



43 



Sacrament. He told the old dirty 
joke about the neurotic pioneer 
who made the emergency landing 
on Joan Turnout's starship — and 
the corpse said: "I'm just one of 
the tourists!" — and the bright 
young men laughed subserviently, feeling slightly contemptuous 
of the boss. 

This enabled Reich to drift into 
the Restricted Room unnoticed 
and pick up one of the Rhodopsin Ionizers, a cube of copper half 
the size of a fulminating cap, but 
twice as deadly as a time-machine. There would be a stink if 
the loss was noted in the weekly 
inventory, and one of the bright 
young men might have trouble 
With government inspectors and 
acquire a sentence; but by that 
time D'Courtney would be dead 
and rotting. 

Wednesday afternoon, Reich 
went over to Melody Lane in the 
heart of the Panty district and 
called on Psych-Songs, Inc. 
There was a clever young woman 
there who had written some brilliant jingles for Sales and some 
effective strikebreaking songs for 
Propaganda back when Sacrament needed everything to smash 
that labor fracas in the Asteroid 
Belt. Duffy Wyg&, her name was, 
and she insisted that Duffy wasn't 
• nickname. Had been in the 
family for years. 

"Weil, Duffy?" He kissed her 
casually. She was pretty as a 



planet, but a trifle too young. 

"Well, Mr. Reich? Still wearing 
that hideous tweed? No woman 
to guide you," She looked at him 
oddly. "Some day I'm going to 
hire one of those Lonely Heart 
Peepers to case your kiss. I keep 
thinking you don't mean business." 

"I don't." 

"You dog." 

"A man has to make up nil 
mind early, Duffy, If he kisses 
girls, he kisses his money goodby." 

"You kiss me." 

"Only because you Ye the 
image of the lady on the sovereign." 

"Pip," she said. 

"Pop," he said. 

"Bim," she said. 

"Bam," he said. 

"I'd like to kill the gimp-head 
who invented that exchange," 
Duffy said revoltedly. "All right, 
handsome. What's your problem?" 

"Gambling," Reich said. "Ellery West, my Rec director, it 
complaining about the gambling 
in Sacrament. Says there's too 
much. Personally, I don't care." 

"Keep a man in debt and he's 
afraid to ask for a raise." 

"You're entirely too smart, 
young lady." 

"So you want a no- gambletype song?" 

"Something like that. Catchy. 



44 



GALAXY SCIINCt FICTION 



Not too obvious. More a delayed 
action than a straight propaganda tune. I'd like the conditioning to be more or less unconscious." / 

Duffy nodded and made quick 
notes. 

"And p/ease make it a tune 
worth hearing. I'lL be listening 
to God knows how many people 
singing and whistling and humming it." 

"You louse. All my tunes are 
worth hearing.'* 

"Once." 

"That's a thousand extra on 
my bill." 

Reich laughed. "Speaking of 
monotony ..." i 

"Which we weren't." 

"What's the most persistent 
tune you ever wrote?" 

"Persistent?" 

"You know what I mean. Like 
those advertising jingles you can't 
get out of your head." 

"Oh, Pepsis, we call 'em." 

"Why?" 

"They say because the first 
one was written centuries ago for 
the primitive radio and TV they 
had then by a character named 
Pepsi. Well, maybe. I don't know. 
I wrote one once . . ." Duffy 
winced in recollection. "Hate to 
think of it even now. It haunted 
me for a year." 

"You're rocketing." 

"Scout's honor, Mr. Reich. It 
was Tenser, Said the Tensor. I 



wrote it for that Panty about the 
crazy mathematician. They 
wanted nuisance value and they 
sure got it. People got so sore, 
they had to withdraw the Panty. 
Lost a fortune." 

"Let's hear it." 

"I couldn't do that to you." 

"Come on, Duffy. I'm curious." 

"You'll regret it." 

"I don't believe you." 

"All right, pig." she said, and 
pulled the multivox panel toward 
her. "This pays you back foe 
the flabby kiss." 

Her fingers and palms slipped 
gracefully over the panel. A tune 
filled the room with agonizing, 
unforgettable banality. It was the 
quintessence of every musical 
cliche Reich had ever heard. No 
matter what melody you tried 
to remember, it invariably led 
down the path of familiarity to 
Tenser, Said the Tensor. Then 
Duffy began to sing in an excruciating little voice: 

Eight, sir; seven, sir; 

Sift, sir; five, sir; 

Four, sir; three, sir; 

Two, sir; one! 

Tenser, said the Tensor. 

Tenser, said the Tensor. 

Tension, apprehension 

And dissension have begun. 

"Oh, my God!" Reich exclaimed. 

"I've got some real clever-up 
tricks in that tune." Duffy said, 
still playing. "Notice the beat 



THI DIMOMSHED MAN 



after 'one?' That's a semi-cadence. Then you get another beat 
after 'begun.' That turns the encf 
of the song into a semi-cadence, 
too, so you can't ever end it. The 
beat keeps you running in circles, 
like: Tension, apprehension and 
dissension have begun. RIFF. 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. RIFF. Tension, appre — " 

"Duffy!" Reich protested. 

"Another thing," she continued 
blandly. "There are thirteen syllables in the last two lines. You'd 
be surprised at the subconscious 
symbolic effect. Count them. 
Tension, apprehension and dissen — " 

Reich started to his feet, 
pounding his palms on his ears. 
"How long is this affliction going 
to last?" 

"Not less than a month." 

"Tension, apprehension and 
diss — I'm ruined. Isn't there any 
Way out?" 

"Sure," Duffy said. "It's easy. 
Just ruin me." She pressed herself against him and planted an 
earnest young kiss. "Lout," she 
murmured. "Pig. Boob. Dolt. 
When are you going to drag me 
through the gutter? Clever up, 
dog. Why aren't you as smart as 
I think you are?" 

"I'm smarter," he said, and 
left. 

The song established itself 
firmly in his mind and echoed 



painfully all the way down to the 
street. Tenser, said the Tensor. 
Tenser, said the Tensor, Tension, 
apprehension and dissension have 
begun. RIFF. A perfect mindblock for a non-Esper to use. 
What peeper could get past that? 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"Much smarter." muttered 
Reich, and took a Jumper to 
Jeremy Church's pawnshop on 
the upper west side. 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"T|ESPITE all rival claims, 
•"-^ pawnbroking is undoubtedly 
the oldest profession. It extends 
from the depths of the past to 
the uttermost reaches of the future, as unchanging as the pawnbroker's shop itself. You walked 
into Jeremy Church's cellar store, 
which was crammed and littered 
with the debris of time, and you 
were in a museum of eternity. 
And even Church himself, wizened, peering, his face blackened 
and bruised by the internal blows 
of suffering, was the very Ur-type 
or final evocation of humanity. 

Church shuffled out of the 
shadows and came face to fare 
with Reich, standing starkly illuminated in a patch of sunlight 
slanting across the counter. He 
did not start. He did not acknowledge Reich's identity. Brushing 
past the man who was his mortal 




 



enemy, he placed himself behind 
the counter and said: "Yes, 

please?" < '> . 
"Hello, Jerry." 

Without looking up, Church 
extended his hand across the 
counter. Reich attempted to clasp 
it. It was snatched away. 

"No," Church said with a snarl 
that was a haTf hysterical laugh, 
"Not that, thank you. Just give 
me what you want to pawn." 

It was the peeper's sour little 
trap, and he had tumbled into it. 
No matter. 

"I haven't anything to pawn, 
Jerry." 

"As poor as that? How the 
mighty have fallen. But we must 
expect it, eh? We all fall." 
Church glanced sidelong at him, 
trying to peep him. Let him try. 
Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. Let him get 
through the crazy tune rattling 
in his head. 

"All of us fall," Church said. 
"All of us." 

"I expect so, Jerry. I haven't 
yet. I've been lucky." 

"I wasn't lucky," the peeper 
said bitterly. "I met you." 

"Jerry," Reich said patiently. 
"I've never been your bad luck. 
It was your own luck that ruined 
you. Not — " 

"You bastard," Church said 
with a horrible lack of emphasis. 
"You cheating, lying, rotten cannibal. Get out of here. I want 



nothing to do with you." 

"Not even my money?" Reich' 
withdrew ten crisp ten sovereign 
notes from his pocket and placed 
them on the counter. Tension, apprehension and dissension have 
begun . . . 

"I want your heart cut open. 
I want your blood spilling on 
the ground, I want the maggots 
eating the eyes out of your living 
head. I don't want your money." 

"Then what do you want, 
Jerry?" 

\ "I told you!" the peeper 
screamed. "Your freezing blood!" 

"What do you want, Jerry?" 
Reich repeated, keeping his eyes 
on the * wizened man. Tension, 
apprehension and dissension have 
begun. He could still control 
Church. It didn't matter that 
Church had been a 2nd, for cbntrol wasn't a question of peeping; 
it was a question of personality. 
Eight, sir; seven, sir; six, sir; five, 
sir . . . He always had and always 
would control Church. 

"What do you want?" Church 
asked sullenly. 

Reich snorted. "You're the 
peeper. You tell me." 

"I can't read it. There's crazy 
music mixing everything up." 

"Then I'll have to tell you. I 
want a gun." 

"A what?" 

"G-U-N. Gun. Ancient weapon. It propels projectiles by explosion." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



M haven't anything like that." 

••Yes, you do, Jerry. Keno 
Quizzard mentioned it to mt 
tome time ago. He saw it. Steel 
and collapsible. Very interesting 
antique." 

"What do you want it for?" 

"Read me, Jerry, and find out. 
I haven't anything to hide. It's 
all quite innocent." 

Church screwed up his face, 
then quit in disgust. "You won't 
stick me with that nagging tune." 
He shuffled off into the shadows. 
There was a distant slamming of 
metal drawers, then the sharp 
crack of a split protective bulb. 
Church returned with a compact 
nodule of tarnished steel and 
placed it on the counter alongside the money. He pressed a stud 
and the lump of metal sprang 
open into steel knuckle-rings, revolver and stiletto. 

"What do you want it for?** 
Church asked again. 

"You're hoping it's something 
that can lead to blackmail, eh?" 
Reich smiled. "Sorry. It's a gift." 

"A dangerous gift." The peeper 
gave him that sidelong glance 
of snarl and laugh. "Ruination 
for someone else, eh?" 

"Not at all, Jerry. It's a gift 
for a friend of mine. Dr. T8." 

"T8!" Church stared at him. 

"Do you know him? He collects old things." 

"I know him." Church began 
to chuckle asthmatically, "But 



I'm beginning to know him better. I'm beginning to feel sorry 
for him." He stopped laughing 
and shot a penetrating glance at 
Reich. "Of course! This will make 
a lovely gift for Gus. A fine 
gift for Gus. Because it's loaded." 
"Oh? Is it?" 

"Five lovely cartridges. A gift 
for Gus." He touched a cam. A 
cylinder snapped out of the side 
of the gun, displaying five chambers filled with brass cartridges. 
He looked from the cartridges to 
Reich. "Five serpent's teeth to 
give to Gus." 

"I told you this was innocent," 
Reich said in a hard voice. "We'll 
have to pull those teeth." 

Church stared at him in astonishment, then began to nod mischievously. "We will, we will,** 
he chirped in a strangely delighted voice. He trotted down 
the aisle and returned with two 
small tools. "A gift for Gus," he 
chanted, almost hysterically. "A 
gift for nice little, rich little, 
happy little Gus." Quickly he 
wrenched each of the metal slugs 
from the cartridges. He slid the 
cases back into the chambers, 
snapped the cylinder home and 
then placed the gun alongside the 
money. 

"All. safe," he said brightly. 
"Safe for dear little Gus." 

He looked at Reich expectantly. Reich extended both hands. 
With one he pushed the money 



CAIAXY SCIENCE MOTION 



toward Church, with the other 
he drew the gun toward himself. 
At that instant. Church changed 
again. The air of chirpy evil left 
him. He grasped Reich's wrists 
with iron claws and bent across 
the counter with blazing intensity. 

"No, Ben," he said, using the 
name for the first time. "That 
isn't the price. You know it. Despite that crazy song in your 
head, I know you know it." 

"All right, Jerry," Reich said 
steadily, never relaxing his hold 
on the gun. "What is the price?" 

"It isn't money. You know 
that. There's been too much 
passed between us for money to 
pass again," 

"What do you want, Jerry?" 

"I know Gus is working for 
you." 

"You didn't get that from me." 

"I got it at Pres — never mind 
where I got it; I know. You're 
cooking something poisonous for 
Gus, aren't you? Something like 
you cooked for me." 

"With a harmless gun? You 
removed the poison yourself, 
Jerry. Remember that." 

"In case I'm asked?" 

"Why should anyone ask?" 

"I don't care what you do to 
Gus. I care about what you do 
for me." 

"What do you want? What's 
the price?" 

"I want to be reinstated," the 



ostracized peeper said. "I want 
to get back into the Gutfd. I want 
to be alive again. That's the 
price." 

"What can I do? I'm not a 
peeper. I don't belong to the 
Guild." 

"You got to me. You got to T8. 
You could get to the Guild. You 
could have me reinstated." 

"Impossible." 

"You can bribe, blackmail, intimidate . . . bless, dazzle, fascinate. You can do it, Ben. You can 
do it for me. Help me, Ben. I 
helped you once." 

"I paid through the nose for 
that help." 

"And I? What did I pay?" the 
peeper screamed. "I paid with 
my life!" 

"You paid with your stupidity." 

"For God's sake, Ben, help me! 
Help me or kill me. I just haven't 
the guts to commit suicide." 

"I haven't got that price in 
my pocket, Jerry. Nobody has." 

"All right. Listen." Church 
tightened his grasp on Reich's 
wrists and leaned farther forward. "Here's what you can do. 
Go to the police. Go to Preston 
Powell. Tell him what really happened in the Chaos Swindle. It'll 
be a Confession, but you'll get 
off, Ben. A big man like you can 
always get off. And I'll be cleared. 
I can get back into the Guild. 
What do you say?" 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



After a pause, Reich said brutally: "1 think The best thing for 
you, Jerry, would be suicide." 

The peeper flung himself back 
as though he had suddenly been 
scorched. 

"Now tell me the price," Fcich 
said. 

Deliberately, Church spat on 
the money. "There will be no 
charge," he said, and turned and 
disappeared into the shadows of 
the cellar. ' 



V 

UNTIL it was destroyed for 
reasons lost in the misty confusion of the late 20th Century, 
the Pennsylvania Station in New 
York City was, unknown to millions of travelers, a link in time. 
Commuters hurtling down the 
east escalators to the terminal 
floor rarely looked up at the towering interior columns and 
groined vaults. Those tourist! 




THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



who gaped and gasped rarely 
knew that all this had been before. They could not know that it 
would be again. The interior of 
the giant terminal was a replica 
of the mighty Baths of Caracalla 
in ancient Rome. So also was the 
sprawling mansion of Maria 
Beaumont, known to her thousand most intimate enemies as 
The Gilt Corpse. 

As Ben Reich glided down the 
east ramp with Dr. T8 at his side 
and murder in his pocket, he 
communicated with his senses in 
stacatto spurts. The sight of the 
mob on the floor below . . . the 
glitter of uniforms, of dress, of 
phosphorescent flesh, of beams 
of pastel light swaying on stilt 
legs . . . 

The sound of voices, of music* 
of annunciators, of echoes . . . 
The kinesthetic squeeze of his 
chest in a clash of hatred and 
terror . . . Tension, apprehension 
end dissension . . . The wonderful 
potpourri, the scent of flesh and 
perfume, of food, of wine, of gilt 
ostentation . . . Tension, apprehension . . . 

The gilt trappings of death, of 
something which had failed for 
seventy years. A lost art ... a* 
lost as phlebotamy, chierurgy, 
alchemy . . . He'd bring death 
back. Not the hasty, crazy killing of the psychotic, the brawler, 
the killings they knew then, but 
the. deliberate, planned — ■ 



"For God's sakef T8 muttered. "Be careful, man. Your 
murder's showing." 

Eight, sir; seven, sir . . . 

"That's better. Here's one of 
the peeper secretaries. He just 
wants to rub elbows with the 
mighty, but keep singing." 

A slender, willowy young man, 
all gush, all cropped golden hair, 
all violet blouse and silver culottes: 

"Dr. T8I Mr. Reich?. I'm 
speechless. Actually." 

Six, sir; five, sir . . . 

T8 shook hands with the secretary. "Hello, Glass. Nice seeing 
you. Miss you at the Guild meetings." 

"I love you for saying it, but 
I hate you because you don't 
mean if." The peeper glanced at 
Reich curiously. " Whatever ia 
going on in Mr. Reich's mind?" 

"Some idiotic song plaguing 
him. Like those ad jingles." 

"Or that old story of Mark 
2ain*s about the poem that 
haunted him? You know— 

Conductor, when you receive a farm.

"Exactly. Reictis got himsett 
infected the same way." 

"You mean the great man's 
actually human?" 

"Superhuman" T8 darted a 
glance of respect mixed with malice at his dragooning employer. 

Plunging into the pools of 
guests was like diving into a tropical aquarium. Swirls of glittering, brilliant human fish. Tables 
of gilt comestables like white and 
cold coral islands. Voices like 
bubbles, all tinkle and pop. The 
ceaseless ground-swell of the 
party heaving in quick tides 
around the celebrities. 

Maria Beaumont clove through 
the waters, arms outstretched, 
eyes outstretched, bosom outstretched . . . her body transformed by pneumatic surgery 
into an exaggerated East Indian 
figure with puffed hips, puffed 
calves and puffed gilt breasts. 

"Ben, darling creature!" She 
embraced him with pneumatic 
intensity. "It's too too wonderful." 

"It's too too plastic, Maria." 

"Have you found that lost million yet?" 

"Just laid hands on it now." 

"Be careful, audacious lover. 
I'm having every morsel of this 
divine party recorded." 

Over her shoulder, Reich shot 
a glance at T8, hovering like an 
escort destroyer. T8 shook his 
head reassuringly. 



"Come and meet everybody 
who's everybody," Maria said. 
She took his arm. In her pea-hen 
whisper, she shrilled: "We'll have 
ages for ourselves later." 

The lights in the groined vaults 
overhead changed again and 
shifted up the spectrum. The 
costumes changed color. Skin 
that had glowed pink now shone 
with eerie luminescence. 

Symon Zigerra . . . Jeanny 
Wonchalk.. . . Tom Moyse, still 
hating him for that dirty trick at 
the Tycho Conference . . . Gloria 
Blomefield, Jr., still as sensual as 
that September weekend when he 
took the Blomefield formula from 
her fay resisting her . . . Bill Winter, still pleading for justice with 
his silent, terrified eyes . . . Bart 
Van Tuerk . . . Edmund Barr, 
who had to be blackmailed out 
of that Sacrament expose . . • 
Toni Asj, still wearing that diamond he gave her when she submitted to degradation to buy 
back those shares of the Stellar 
Syndicate. She never got the 
shares, but she had the diamond. 
She attributed her degeneracy to 
him, he'd heard. 

On his left flank, T8 gave the 
prearranged signal: 

Danger! 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. RIFF. Tension, apprehension and dtssentien 
have begun . . . 

Maria was introducing another 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



91 



lad, all gush, all crapped copper 
hair, all fuchsia blouse and Prussian blue culottes. 

"Larry Ferar, Ben. My other 
social secretary. Larry's been dying to meet you." 

Four, sir; three, sir . . . 

"Mr. Reich! But too thrilled. 
I can't utter word one." 

Two, sir; one! 

The young man accepted 
Reich's smile and moved on. Still 
circling in convoy, T8 gave Reich 
a reassuring nod. Again the overhead lights changed. Portions of 
the guests' costumes appeared to 
dissolve. Reich, who had never 
succumbed to the fashion of 
wearing ultra-violet windows in 
his clothes, stood secure in his 
opaque suit, watching with contempt the quick, roving eyes 
around him. 

T8 signaled: Danger! 

Tenser, said the Tensor . . . 

Glass appeared at Maria's elbow. "Madame." he lisped, "a 
slight contretemps." 

"What is it?" 

"The Chervil boy. Galen Chervil." 

T8's face constricted. 

"What about him?" Maria 
peeped through the crowd. 

"Left of the fountain. An impostor, madame. I have peeped 
him. He has no invitation. He*3 
a college student. He bet he could 
crash the party. He intends to 
steal a picture of you as proof," 



"Of me?" Maria said, staring 
through the windows in young 
Chervil's clothes. "What does he 
think of me?" 

"Well, madame, he's extremely 
difficult to probe. I think he'd 
like to steal more from you than 
your picture." 

"Oh, would he?" Maria cackled. 

"He would, madame. Shall he 
be removed?" 

"No." Maria glanced once 
more at the formidable young 
man, then turned away. "He'll 
get his proof." 

"And it won't be stolen," Rei^li 
said. 

"Jealous!" she squawked. 
"Let's dine." 

In response to T8's urgent sign, S 
Reich stepped aside momentarily. 

"Reich, you've got to give it 
up." 

"You're crazy! Why should 1?" 

"The Chervil boy." 

"What about him?" 

"He's a 2nd." 

"Damn!" 

"He's precocious, brilliant. I 
met him at Powell's last Sunday. 
Maria Beaumont never invites 
peepers to her house. I'm only in 
on your pass. I was depending on 
that." 

"And this kid has to crash!" 

"Give it up, Reich." 
'.■ "Maybe I can stay away from 
htm." 

"Reich, I can block the social

OALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



secretaries; they're only 3rds. But 
I can't guarantee to handle them 
nnd a 2nd, even if he is only a 
hid. He's young and he may be 
too nervous to do any clever 
peeping. But I can't promise." 

"I'm not quitting," Reich 
growled. "I'll never get a chance 
like this again. Even if I knew 
I could, 1 wouldn't quit. I 
couldn't. I've got the stink of 
D'Courtney in my nostrils. I — ** 

"Then we'd better Have the 
Chervil boy bounced." 

"Not a chance. You saw the 
way she looked him over." 

"What are you going to do?" 

"Go through with it, damn 
you!" 

"You'll never — " 

Reich turned his scowl full on 
T8's nervous face. "I know you're 
looking for a chance to squirm 
out of this, you little bastard. But 
you won't. We're trapped in this 
together, right down the line, all 
the way to Demolition." 

He shaped his distorted face 
into a frozen smile and rejoined 
his hostess on a couch alongside 
one of the tables. It was still the 
custom to feed each other at 
these affairs, but the gesture that 
had originated in Oriental courtesy and generosity had degenerated into erotic play. The morsels 
of food were accompanied by 
tongue touched to fingers and 
were as often offered between the 
lips. 



Reich endured it all with a 
seething impatience, waiting for 
the vital word from T8. Part of 
T8's Intelligence work was to locate D'Courtney 's hiding place in 
the house. He watched the little 
peeper drift through the crowd of 
diners, probing, prying, searching, 
until he at last returned with a 
negative shake of his head and 
gestured toward Maria Beaumont. Clearly, Maria was the 
only source of information, and 
she was too obsessed to be easily 
probed. It was another in a neverending series of crises that had to 
be met by the killer- instinct. 

Between the Truite Au Bleu 
and the Saueisses Au Vin Blanc, 
Reich^arose and crossed toward 
the fountain. T8 intercepted him. 

"What are you up to, Reich?'* 

"Isn't it obvious? Get the Chervil boy off her mind." 

"Reich, don't go near that 
boy!" 

"Get out of my way." Reich 
radiated a burst of savage compulsion that made the peeper recoil. He signaled in fright and 
Reich tried to control himself. 

"It's taking chances, I know, 
but the odds aren't as long as 
you think. In the first place, he's 
young and green. In the second 
place, he's a crasher and scared. 
In the third place, he can't be flying full jets or he wouldn't have 
let the secretaries peep him so 
easily." 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

"Have you got any conscious 
control? Can you double-think?" 

"I've got that song on my mind 
and enough trouble to make 
double-thinking a pleasure. Now 
get the hell out of the way and 
stand by to peep Madame, The 
Gilt Corpse." 

CHERVIL was eating alone 
alongside the fountain, clumsily attempting to appear to 
belong. 

■"Pip," said Retch. 
''Pop/* said Chervil. 
"Bim," said Reich. 
"Bam," said Chervil. 
With the formality of slang 
disposed of, Reich eased himself 
down alongside the boy. "I'm 
Ben Reich." 

"I'm Gaily Chervil. I mean 
Galen. I — " He was visibly impressed by the name of Reich. 

Tension, apprehension and distension . . . 

"That damned song," Reich 
muttered. "Heard it for the first 
time the other day. Can't get it 
out of my mind. Eight, sir; seven, 
sir; six, sir; five — Oh, for God's 
sake! Talk to me, Chervil, before 
I go crazy." 

"What should I talk about?" 
"Ever been in The Gilt Corpse 
before?" 

"Do you mean the house?" 
"Pop," grinned Reich. 
"Pip," smiled the boy. 
"She knows you're a phony." 



"No!" 

Reich nodded. Tension, apprehension . . . 

"Should I start running?" 

"Without the picture?" 

"You know about that too? 
There must be a peeper around." 

"Two of them. Her social secretaries. People like you are their 
job." 

"What about that picture, Mr. 
Reich? I've got fifty dollars rid* 
ing on it. You ought to know 
what a bet means. You're a gamb 
—I mean, financier." 

"Glad I'm not a peeper, eh? 
Never mind, I'm not insulted. 
See that arch? Go straight 
through and turn right. You'll 
find a study. The walls are 
lined with Maria's portraits, all 
in synthetic stones. Help yourself. 
She'll never miss one." 

The boy leaped up, scattering 
food off his lap. "Thanks, Mr. 
Reich. Some day I'll do you a 
favor." 

"Such as?" 

"You'd be surprised. I happen 
to be a — " He caught himself and 
blushed. "You'll find out. si r. 
Thanks again." He began weaving his way across the floor toward the north arch. 

Four, sir; rhree, sir; twn, sir; 
one! 

Reich returned to his hostess. 

"Naughty lover," she said. 
"Who've you been feeding? I'll 
tear her eyes out." 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTIOM 



"The Chervil boy," Reich answered. "He asked me where you 
keep your pictures." 

"Ben! You didn't tell him!" 

"Sure did. He's on his way to 
get one now. Then he'll take off. 
You know I'm jealous." 

She leaped from the couch and 
waddled north. 

"Bam," said Reich. 

T> Y eleven o'clock, the ritual of 
dining had aroused the company to a point of intensity that 
required solitude and darkness. 
Maria Beaumont had never failed 
her guests, and tonight Reich 
hoped The Gilt Corpse would not 
fail him when T8 appeared, looking pleased and yet worried. 

"1 don't know how you got 
away with it," T8 whispered. 
"You're broadcasting bloodlust 
on every wavelength." 

"The kid doesn't know?" 

"Not a notion. You were right. 
He's scared ... off balance." 

"And I know who knocked him 
off balance. Where's D' Courtney?" Reich grabbed TS's arm. 
"Don't tell me he isn't in the 
house, you little roach. I can 
smell him waiting for me." 

"Reich!" T8 tore his arm away. 
"Yes, he's here. Alone. No servants. Only two bodyguards provided by Maria. @kins was right. 
He's dangerously sick . . ." 

"To hell with that I'll cure 
him. Where is he?" 



"Go through the west arch. 
Turn right. Up the stairs. 
Through overpass. Turn right. 
Picture Gallery. Door between 
paintings of the Rape of Lucrece 
and the Rape of the Sabine 
Women . . ." 

"That sounds authentic." 

"Open the door. Up a flight of 
steps to an anteroom. Two guards 
in the anteroom. D'Courtney's inside, It's the old wedding suite 
her grandfather built." 

"The wedding suite? I like that 
touch." 

The Gilt Corpse began to 
clamor for attention. Flushed and 
shining with perspiration, standing in the glare of a pink light on 
the dais between the two fountains, she clapped her hands for 
silence: Smack, smack, smack. 
The moist palms beat together, 
and the echoes roared in Reich's 
ears: Death, death, death, 

"Darlings!" she cried. "We're 
going to have so much fun tonight. We're going to provide our 
own entertainment." A subdued 
groan went up from the guests 
and an anonymous voice called.: 
"I'm just one of the tourists." 

Through the laughter, Maria 
said: "Naughty lovers, don't be 
disappointed. We're going to play 
a wonderful old game; and we're 
going to play it in the dark." 

The company cheered up as 
the overhead lights began to dim 
and disappear. The dais still 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN

blazed and, in the light, Maria 
produced a tattered volume. 
Reich's gift. 
Tension . . . 

Maria turned the pages slowly, 
blinking at the unfamiliar print. 

.Apprehension . . . 

"It's a game," Maria cried, 
"called Sardine. Isn't that too 
adorable?" 

She took the bait. She's on the 
hook. In three minutes I'll be invisible. Reich touched his pockets. The disarmed gun. The Rhodopsin. Tension, apprehension 
und dissension have begun. 

"One player," Maria read, "is 
selected to be It. That's going to 
be me. All the lights are ex — 
extinguished and the It hides." 

As Maria struggled through the 
directions, the great hall was reduced to pitch darkness with the 
exception of the single pink beam 
on the stage. 

"Sue — successively, each player finding the Sardines joins them 
until all are hidden in one place, 
and the last player, who is the 
loser, is left to wander alone in 
the* dark." The last light blinked 
out. Reich was invisible at last. 
He bed half an hour to slip up 
into the house, kill D'Courtney, 
and then return to the game. T8 
was committed to pinning the 
peeper secretaries out of the line 
of his attack. It was safe. It was 
fool-proof except for the Chervil 
boy. He had to take that chance. 



HE crossed the main hall and 
jostled into mewing bodies at 
the west arch. He went through 
the arch into the music room. 
The piezo crystals were resonating automatically in the back" 
ground, but there were muffled 
dischords from an open piano as 
though the strings were being 
used for a wrestling mat. Savage 
and intent, Reich ignored this 
and turned right, groping for the 
stairs. A curse and a clash 
sounded from the piano, then 
shod feet ran .across the floor and 
somebody soft banged into him. 

"If you touch me," the voire 
of Duffy Wyg& cried hysterically, 
"IH kill you." 

Reich froze. "Duffy!" he exclaimed, and then could have torn 
his tongue out. 

"Who's that? Mr. Reich?" 
"Yes." 

Her hand touched his arm and 
felt the cloth. "Bless you, Mr. 
Reich." She leaned against him 
weakly. "God bless that hideous 
tweed." 

"What's the matter. Duffy ? 
Don't you like the gutter?* 1 

"I don't like the company." 

"Then go back to Melody 
Lane." 

She held tight to his arm. "This 
is my first and last visit. How do 
I get out of this sty?" 

"Back through the main hall 
and up the ramp." 

"I don't know which way is 




 



which. Get me out of here, Mr. 
Reich. I need a bodyguard." 

In an agony of impatient fury, 
he searched for excuses. A retching voice' behind him said: "Can 
1 d-do you a favor, Mr. Reich?'* 

''Who's that?" 

"A refugee. Galen Chervil. 
Slightly sick." 

Eight, sir; seven, sir; six, sir; 
five, sir . . . 

The Chervil boy loomed in the 
darkness alongside. "I had to run 
hard to get away from that . . . 
picture. I'm still running, between 
spasms, I never was happier to 
lose fifty dollars." 

Four, sir; three, sir; two, sir; 
one! 

"I'm running too," Duffy said, 

"Just babes in the woods," 
Chervil said. "High-life. Pfoo! 
Let's run together." 

"Do you know the way out in 
the dark?" 

Tenser, said the Tensor. Tenser, said the Tensor. 

"I can find it. Give me -your 
hand, Duffy." 

"How do you know my name?" 

"Oop. Slip of the mind. Not 
myself tonight. Coming with us, 
Mr. Reich?" 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun. 

"No," Reich choked. "Wish r 
could. Impossible. You two kids 
get out of here. Jet!" 

They scuttled off in the dark. 

RIFF! 



At the foot of the stairs he was 
forced to climb over a barrier of 
bodies with octopus arms that 
tried to pull him down. He ascended the stairs, seventeen eternal steps, and felt his way 
through a close tunnel overpass 
papered with velour, Suddenly he 
was seized and a woman crushed 
herself against him. 

"Hello, Sardine," she whispered 
in his ear. "Ow!" she exclaimed, 
feeling the hard outlines of the 
gun in his breast pocket. "What's 
that?" He slapped her hand away. 
"Clever up, Sardine," she giggled. 
"Get out of the can." 

He divested himself of her and 
bruised his nose against the deadend of the overpass. He turned 
right, opened a door and found 
himself in a vaulted gallery over 
fifty feet long. The lights were 
extinguished here, too, but the luminiscent paintings, glowing under ultraviolet spotlights, filled 
the gallery with a virulent glow. 
It was empty. 

Between a livid Lucrece and a 
horde of buttocky Sabine Women 
was a door of polished bronze. 
Reich stopped before it, removed 
the tiny Rhodopsin Ionizer from 
his back pocket and attempted to 
poise the copper tube between 
his thumbnail and forefinger. His 
hands were trembling so violently 
that hecould not control them. 

His fingers steadied. He poised 
the Rhodopsin cap, then thrust 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



it 



open the bronze door, revealing 
nine steps mounting to an anteroom. Reich flipped his thumbnail against the copper cube as 
though he were trying to flip a 
penny to the Moon. 

As the Rhodcpsin cap flew up 
into the anteroom, Reich averted 
his eyes. There was a cold purple 
flash. Reich leaped up the stairs. 

The two Beaumont House 
guards were seated on the bench 
where he had caught them. Their 
faces were "sagging, their visual 
sense destroyed, their time sense 
abolished, their synapses clattering in sn"ort-circuited chaos. They 
were out of the continuum. 

If anyone entered and found 
the guards before he was finished, 
he was on the road to Demolition. 
If the guards revived before he 
was finished, he was on the road 
to Demolition. No matter what 
happened, it was a final gamble 
with Demolition. 

Leaving the last of his sanity 
behind him, Reich pushed open a 
jeweled door and entered the wedding suite. 

VI 

REICH found , himself in a 
spherical room that was the 
heart of a giant orchid. The walls 
were curling orchid petals, the 
pillars were stamens, the floor was 
a golden calyx; the chairs, tables 
and couches were orchid and gold. 



But the room was old . . . old . . , 

the petals faded and peeling, the 
golden tile floor ancient and the 
tessellations splitting. There was 
an old, old man stretched on the 
couch, musty and wilted, like a 
dried weed . . . like the dessication of a venomous mandrake 
root. 

It was D'Courtney, stretched 
out like a corpse. 

Reich slammed the door in 
rage. "You can't be dead! I can't 
be cheated!" 

The faded man started up, 
stared, then arose painfully from 
the couch, his face breaking into 
a smile. 

"Still alive!" Reich cried exultantly. 

D'Courtney stepped toward 
Reich, smiling, his arms outstretched, as though welcoming a 
prodigal son. The smile was almost imbecile. 

Alarmed again, Reich growled: 
"Are you deaf?" 

The old man shook his head. 

"You speak English, you son of 
a bitch," Reich shouted. "You can 
hear me. You can understand me, 
I'm Reich. Ben Reich of Sacrament." 

D'Courtney nodded, still smiling. His mouth worked soundlessly. His eyes glistened with 
sudden tears. 

"What the hell is the matter 
with you? I'm Reich. Ben Reich! 
Do you know me? Answer me." 




 



D'Courtney shook his head and 
tapped his throat. His mouth 
worltfcd again. Rusty sounds 
ceme; then words as faint as dust: 
"Ben . . . dear Ben . . . waited so 
long. Now . 7 . can't talk. My 
throat . , . can't talk." Again he 
attempted to embrace Reich. 

Bristling, Reich stepped around 
D'Courtney like an animal, his 
hackles raised, the murder boiling in his blood, the horrible images of D'Courtney's agony rushing through his congested eyes. 
His breath came in gasps. His 
heart pounded. He poised himself before D'Courtney and glared 
into the old man's face. 

D'Courtney's mouth formed 
the words: ''Dear Ben . . ." 

"You know why I'm here. 
What are you trying to do — make 
love to me?" His hand lashed 
out. The old man reeled back 
from the slap and fell into an 
orchid chair that looked like a 
wound. 

"Listen to me, you old son of 
a bitch." Reich followed D'Courtney and stood over him. "This 
payoff's been on the fire for years. 
Fire? Volcano! And you want to 
turn aside the magma with a 
Judas kiss!" 

"Ben," D'Courtney whispered 
in horror. "Listen, Ben . . 

"You've been at my throat for 
ten years. Ten years! There was 
room enough for both of us. Sacrament and D'Courtney. All the 



room In time and space, bu$ you 
wanted my blood, my heart. The 
Man With No Face!" 

D'Courtney shook his head in 
bewilderment. "No, Ben. No . . .** 

"Don't call me Ben. I'm no 
friend of yours. Last week I gave 
you one more chance to wash in 
decency. Me. Ben Reich. I asked 
for armistice. Merger. My father 
would spit on me if he were alive. 
Every fighting Reich would 
blacken my face with contempt. 
But I asked for peace, didn't I? 
Eh?" Reich prodded D'Courtney 
savagely. "Didn't I?" 

O'Courtney's face was blanched 
and staring. Finally he whispered: 
"Yes. You asked ... I accepted." 

"Accepted!" Reich cut in 
sharply. "Are these the tactics 
that win for you? It isn't possible, 
is it? The phony affection. Dear 
Ben. The warmth from a frozen 
heart. Empty stupid lies. What 
imbecile could swallow them?" 

Reich reached down and 
yanked D'Courtney to his feet. 
The old man was frail and light, 
but his weight bruised Reich's 
arm, and the touch of the old skin 
burned Reich's fingers. 

"No merger. No peace. Death. 
That's the choice, eh?" 

D'Courtney shook his head and 
tried to make signs. 

"Will you surrender?" 

"Yes," D'Courtney whispered. 
"Yes, Ben. Yes." 

"Liar! Protective mimicry. 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



That's your trick. You imitate 
the idiots and trap us at your 
leisure. But not me. Never!" 

"I'm not . . . your enemy, Ben." 

"No," Reich spat. "You're not 
because you're dead. You've been 
dead ever since I came into this 
orchid coffin. Man With No Face! 
Can you hear me screaming for 
the last time? You're finished!" 

Reich tore the gun out of his 
breast pocket. He touched the 
stud and it opened like a red steel 
flower. D'Courtney backed away 
in horror. Reich caught the back 
of D'Courtney's thin neck and 
wrenched the head toward him. 
He had to fire through the open 
hiouth for the trick to work. 

At that instant, one of the orchid petals swung open, and a 
girl burst into the room. In a catastrophic blaze of surprise, 
Reich saw the corridor behind 
her, a bedroom door standing 
open at the far end; the girl, yellow hair flying, dark eyes wide in 
alarm ... a lightning flash of 
wild beauty. 

"Father !" she screamed. 

She ran toward D'Courtney. 
Reich swung quickly between 
them, never relaxing his hold on 
the old man. The girl stopped 
short, backed away, then darted 
to the left around Reich, screaming. Reich pivoted and cut viciously at her with the stiletto. 
She eluded him, but was driven 
back of the couch. Reich thrust 



the point of the stiletto between 
the old man's teeth and forced 
his jaws open. m 
"No!" she cried. "No! Father!" 
Reich pulled the trigger. There 
was a muffled explosion and a 
gout of blood spurted from the 
back of D'Courtney's head. Reich 
let the body drop. 

The girl fell forward to her 
knees and crawled to the body. 
She moaned in pain as she 
snatched the gun from the mouth, 
where it had still hung. Then she 
crouched over the twitching 
body, silent, fixed, staring into 
the waxen face. 

Reich gasped for breath and 
beat his knuckles together painfully. When the roaring in his 
ears subsided, he propelled himself toward the girl, trying to 
arrange his thoughts and make 
split-second alterations in his 
plans. He had never counted on a 
witness. No one mentioned a 
daughter. God damn T8! Now 
he would have to kill the girl. 
HeShe leaped to her feet, d;iii«il 
out of his sodden grasp, ran to 
the jeweled door, flung it open 
and ran into the anteroom. As 
the door slowly closed, Reich had 
a glimpse of the guards still 
slumped on the bench and the 
girl running silently down the 
stairs with the gun in her Standi 
. . . with Demolition in her hands. 
The clogged blood began 



*2 




 



pounding through his veins again. 
He reached the door, ran through 
and tore down the steps to the 
picture gallery. It was empty, 
but the door to the overpass was 
just closing. And still no sound 
from her. Still no alarm. How 
long before she started screaming 
the house down? 

He raced down the gallery and 
entered the overpass. It was 
still pitch dark. He blundered 
through, reached the head of the 
stairs that led down to the music 
room and paused again. He went 
down the steps. The dark silence 
was terrifying. Why didn't she 
scream? Where was she? 

Reich crossed toward the west 
arch and knew he was at the 
edge of the main hall by the quiet 
plash of the fountains. Where was 
the girl? In all that black silence, 
where was she? And the gun! 
Christ! The tricked gun! 

A hand touched his arm. Reich 
jerked in alarm. T8 whispered: 
"I've been standing by. It took 
you exactly — " 

"You clumsy peeper !" Reich 
burst out. "There was a daughter! Why didn't you — " 

T8 muttered, "Let me peep it.** 
After fifteen seconds of burning 
silence, he began to tremble. In a 
terrified voice he whined: "My 
God! Oh, my God . . 

His terror was the catalyst . 
Reich's control returned. He began thinking again, "Shut up," 



he growled. "It isn't Demolition 
yet." 

"You'll have to kill her too, 
Reich. You'll — " 

"Find her first. Cover the 
house. You got her pattern from 
me. Locate her. I'll be waiting at 
the fountain. Jet!" 

He flung T8 from him and 
staggered to the fountain. At the 
jasper rim, he bent and bathed 
his burning face in the water. It 
was sparkling burgundy. Reich 
wiped his face and ignored the 
muffled sounds that came from 
the other side of the basin. Evidently some persons were bathing 
in wine. 

He considered swiftly. The girl 
must be located and killed. At 
once. If she still had the gun 
when T8 found her, the gun 
would be used. If she didn't? 
Strangle her? No, the fountain. 
She could be found drowned in 
the fountain . . . just another 
guest who had bathed in wine 
too long. But it had to be soon, 
before this damned Sardine game 
was ended. Where was T8? 
Where was the girl? 

T8 came blundering up through 
the darkness, wheezing. 

"Well?" 

"She's gone." 

"You weren't gone long enough 
to find out. If this is a doublecross — " 

"Whom could I cross? I'm o« 
the same road you are- I tell you 



THE DEMOLISHED MAN 




her pattern's nowhere in the 
house. She's gone." 

■ Anyone notice her leave?" 

"No." 

"Out of the house!" 

"We'd better leave, too." 

"Yes, but we can't run. Once 
we get out of here, we'll have the 
rest of the night to find her, but 
we can't sneak out. Too suspicious. Where's Maria?" 

"For God's sake, Reich . . ." 

"I tell you we've got to leave 
as though nothing's happened. 
Whi n 's The Gilt Corpse?" 

"In the projection room." 

"Watching a Panty?" 

"No. Still playing Sardine. 
They're packed in there like fish 
in a can. We're almost the last 
out here in the house." 

"Wandering alone in the dark, 
eh? Come on." 

He gripped T8's shaking elbow 
and marched him toward the projection room. As he walked, he 
called plaintively: "Hey, where 
is everybody? Maria!" 

T8 emitted a hysterical sob. 
Reich shook him roughly. "Play 
up! We'll be out of here in five 
minutes. Then you can start 
worrying," 

"If they find the body before 
we leave, we're sunk." 

"Who'll find the body?" 

"The guards." 

"Not in five minutes. They're 
out of this world. Well out." 
"Servants."

THE DEMOLISHED MAN 



"They won't leave their quarters till the Sardine game is over. 
I tell you we'll be safe in five 
minutes." 

"But if we're trapped in here, 
we won't be able to get the gid. 
We'll—" 

"We won't be trapped. ABC, 
Gus — audacious, brave and confident." Reich pushed open the 
door of the projection room. 
There was darkness in here, too, 
but the heat of many bodies. 
"Hey," he called. "Where is everybody? I'm all alone." 

No answer. 

"Maria, I'm all alone in the 
dark." 

A muffled sputter, then a burst 
of laughter. 

"Darling!" Maria called. 
"You've missed all the fun, poor 
dear." 

"Where are you, Maria? I've 
come to say good night." 

"Oh, you can't be leaving." 

"Sorry, dear. It's late. I've got 
to swindle a friend tomorrow. 
Where are you, Maria?" 

"Come up on the stage, darling." 

Reich walked down the aisle, 
felt for the steps and mounted the 
stage. He felt the cool perimeter 
off the Pantys glpbe behind him. 
A voice called: "All right. Now 
we've f*ot him. T.^hts!" 

White light flooded the globe 



and blinded Reich. The guests 
seated in the chairs around the 
stage started to whoop with 
laughter, then howled In disappointment. 

"Oh Ben, you cheat," Maria 
screeched. "You're still dressed. 
Xhat isn't fair. We've been catching everybody divinely flagrante" 

"Some other time, Maria dear." 
Reich extended his hand before 
him and began the graceful bow 
of farewell. "Respectfully, madame, I give you my thanks 
for — " He broke off in amazement. On the gleaming white lac^ 
of his cuff, an angry red spot appeared. 

In stunned silence, Reich saw 
a second, then a third red splotch 
appear. He snatched his hand 
back and a red drop spattered on 
the stage before him, to be followed by a slow, inexorable 
stream of crimson droplets, 

"That's blood!" Maria 
screamed. "There's someone upstairs bleeding. Ben. for heaven's 
sake, you can't leave now. Lights! 
Lights!" 

Blood — dripping through the 
ceiling — D'Courtney's blood, Not 
enough to fill a teaspoon yet, but: 
Reich felt he was drowning in it. 

Tension, apprehension and dissension have begun . , .

Illustrated by DAVID STONE 



SCIENTIST William Manning Norcross drank his 
soup meticulously and 
scooped up the vegetables at the 
bottom of the cup, while his attention was focused on the television screen. He watched girls 
swimming in formation as he 
gnawed the bone of his steak. He 
stolidly ate the baked potato with 
his fingers when the girls turned 
around, displaying "Weejees Are 
Best" signs pasted to their 
shapely backs. The final flourish 
was more formation swimming, 
where they formed a wheel under 
Water, swimming past the camera 



to display in individual inters 
stuck to their bare midriffs: 
"Wonderful Weejees!" 

Norcross chuckled appreciatively when a fat old man swam 
after them with an "Is That 
Right?" strung across his behind. 
Young men followed him, each 
carrying a one-word card that 
spelled: "You— Bet— It's— Right 
— Don't — Be — Left — Buy 
— Weejees — P The scene ended 
on the surface. The grotesque old 
man was far in back, while the 
young men caught the young 
women, and together they kicked

tance, which by a trick of photography mounted to the sky and the 
words swept around the globe in 
monstrous letters: "buy weejees!" 

The dessert was apple pie, and 
Scientist Norcross turned the 
screen to the "Abstractions" 
channel. Watching the colors and 
patterns form in response to the 
music, he finished the pie and 
licked his fingers appreciatively. 
He pressed a stud to reveal the 
mirror wall before he activated 
the molecular cleanup. 

Not many people would do 
that. It was not contrary to morals, exactly, but it was like 
scratching in public, and it took 
a scientific mind to study the 
human form unshaken, immediately after ingestion. There was 
pie on his tunic and gravy in his 
hair and a smear of grease from 
cheek to ear. With no sign of 
squeamishness. he smeared beet 
juice on his nose and studied the 
effect before he depressed the 
"Clear" stud. 

He stretched and stood up 
While the tray disappeared, then 
turned and glanced in the mirror 
again. Nothing on him. Clean. He 
yawned luxuriantly before he 
tapped the "Finish" panel on the 
door and stepped forth, an immaculate and well-fed gentlemen 
of the year 2512. 

He had a well-trained sense of 
humor, and a smile crossed his 



lips as he thought of the terror 
a 21st Century man would feel in 
such an eating chamber. When 
he pressed the clear button, the 
barbarian would be clean — really, 
sterilely clean — for the first time 
in his life, and without clothes, 
too. Oh, what a jape that would 
be, for the molecular cleanup 
would immediately disintegrate 
such abominations as the fur of 
animals, and much clothing 400 
years ago was actually made of 
such things as sheep hair. 

He bowed to a pretty woman 
just entering a cubicle and 
thought defiantly that a scientific 
mind afforded much amusement. 
There was no illusion in his icy 
clear thoughts, for they were not 
befogged by moral questions. 

With a sigh. Scientist William 
Manning Norcross returned to 
the difficult problem he had set 
aside while having lunch. The 
garden city was beautiful outside, 
but he gave only passing attention to the rain slithering down 
the huge dome of force over the 
buildings. He did not pause to 
admire the everlasting flowers in 
their carefully simulated beds of 
soil. 

John Davis Drumstetter was in 
a state of crisis again, and Scientist Norcross was worried. 

His fears were well founded. 
The young man wheeled on 
Scientist Norcross the minute he 
stepped through the hedge into 




 



the force field under the giant live 
oak tree. 

"Where are they?" he demended. "I am coming to believe, Scientist, that your reputation is exceeded only by your 
inability to live up to it. The 
problem is only an extension of 
your own early work. You volunteered cooperation, and I accepted it gladly, but your, delays 
are very distressing!" 

"Johnny," said Scientist Norcross, "the press of my own experiments — " 

"Then tell me you won't do it!" 

"I want to help you. Don't you 
remember the years we spent together in your training to the high 
calling of scientist? I took your 
young hand, Johnny, and helped 
you over the juvenile stumbling 
blocks. Why, your first mind machine was one I gave you, and 
when — " 

"You're a fraud, Scientist!" 
said the young man bitterly. 

"The young never appreciate 
the old," sighed Norcross. 

"Go suck a mango!" 

Norcross was shocked. "There's 
no call for being obscene, John 
Davis Drumstetter," he said 
sternly. "To mention eating to 
another person, and right in public, where you might be overheard — " 

"Eat a slippery, sloppery 
mango on television, you old 
fool! Smear it all over your face 



while you ingest it into your unspeakable digestive tract!" 

"John Davis Drumstetter," said 
the scientist with great control, 
"I have been your friend since 
you were born. Your father and 
I became scientists on the same 
day. You are young and overeager. Just remember," he finished with a warning shake of his 
finger, "Satellite Station One 
wasn't built in a day!" 

Drumstetter stopped his furious pacing and subdued his rage 
with visible effort. He chilled, like 
red steel hardening, and when he 
spoke he was in full command of 
himself. 

"Now listen to me, Norcross, 
and keep your mouth shut. For 
the past forty years I've been 
working on the stellar overdrive. 
We have the Solar System in our 
reticule, colonies have been established on every planet, and ships 
have been sent to Alpha Centauri, 
with every chance that mankind 
has established itself in that solar 
system. But in the four hundred 
years since science emerged from 
the dark ages, we've managed to 
creep only four light years away 
from home! And you, Scientist, 
arc withholding your work on the 
overdrive relay. Do you understand why your plea of old 
friendship does not affect me? In 
the past two years, you've done 
nothing — " 

"Experiments that must be 



DEAD END 



kept secret," mumbled Norcross. 

"And it is my belief," said the 
young man in a clipped, cold 
voice, "that you have sold yourself to your taste buds and digestive tract. Either that," and here 
his burning rage came into the 
open, "or you are a pseudo-life!" 

At this ultimate insult, Scientist Norcross was silent with indignation. He watched Drumstetter shrug into a stole, turn down 
the power to the huge mind machine, sling his reticule over his 
shoulder, and stalk off through 
the hedge. 

NORCROSS slumped into a 
chair, his mind in confusion. 
He heard Drumstetter's plane as 
it left the ground. Plane, he 
thought, his mind avoiding the 
problem. Plane. What a curious 
name, handed down through the 
ages, to call a swift skip powered 
by Earth's magnetism. An original plane fought the air, buoyed 
up by the lift of plane surfaces in 
movement. When the movement 
stopped, it died. 

Died. Death. Pseudo-life. 
Scientist Norcross shuddered. 
His well-trained sense of humor 
did not include abominations. 

He took the communication 
from his pocket and cleared to 
Prime Center. When the prim, 
grim face of Prime Center himself 
in the little disc was sharp, Norcross reported what had hap


pened , even to the suggestion 
Drumstetter had made that he 
was pseudo-life. 

"This is very bad," said Prime 
Center. "Monica Drake Lane is 
now pseudo-life, too." 

"God's name!" 

"Took her skip into a cliff in 
the Sierra _ DUntains yesterday. 
Disconnected the anti-collision. 
A clear case." 

"What will this do to Drumstetter?" 

"Nothing," said Prime Center, 
"unless he learns." 

"•Is she ready?" 

"I'm sending her to you right 
now for indoctrination. Reports 
are that Drumstetter is visiting 
scientists on the West Coast, and 
Probability reports that he may 
cover the world before he returns. 
Do you understand? Her indoctrination must be perfect." 

"It always has been." Norcross 
pulled his lip. "The same limitation will be in Monica Drake 
Lane?" he asked hopelessly. 

"Of course," said Prime Center. 
"We'll keep you posted on developments." 

"You'd better try women," said 
Norcross. 

"Women, narcotics, or anything 
else! I'd eat a blueberry pie with 
my hands behind my back at 
high noon," said Prime Center 
with fierce obscenity, "if I 
thought it would do any good!" 

He put the connection. 



A L A X Y SCIENCE MCTION 



Norcross was still under the 
oak tree, lost in contemplation of 
a color abstraction on his little 
communication, when a tall 
blonde girl, brown as a berry, 
stepped hesitantly through the 
hedge. She walked to him and, 
when he looked up, she buried 
her face in her hands. He stood 
end held her shoulders. 

"Now, now," said Scientist 
Norcross, "don't cry, my dear." 

"But this is so puzzling — and I 
wasn't crying," she answered. 
"What's happened to me?" 

"Sit down, Monica, and tell me 
what you think has happened." 

"But I don't know. You see. 
the last I remember is walking 
through the Psych Lab in San 
Francised, and suddenly — suddenly, I'm in New York and 
they're sending me to you. What 
has happened?" 

"Where do you first remember 
being in New York?" 

"In the — oil, I don't know!" 
She was in a flush of embarrassment. 

"I'll help you, my dear. You 
were in the pseudo-life clinic. 
You are not exactly Monica 
Drake Lane any longer. She died. 
You are pseudo-life." 

Her eyes were bright and the 
pupils were pinpointed from 
shock. 

"You are the pseudo-life Monica Drake Lane. To all outward 
appearances, you are an exact 




counterpart of the girl. Inwnnlly? 
Well, your internal organs have 
been simplified, and you cannot 
reproduce. Aside from such minor 
changes, you are identical, and 
incidentally a much more efficient 
creature than your prototype. 
And if your mind, which is a very 
good one, was a human mind, I 
could not tell you this. Pseudolife is a most remarkable thing, 
but Lewis and Havinghurst and 
Covalt, who developed it 300 
years ago, were never able to 
imbue pseudo-life with what they 
called the minus-one factor, 
which incluiks the phenomenal 
human emotional sensitivity, 
among other things. Are you feeling better now?" 

"Why, yes — " Her voice trailed 
off. 

"You are no longer a slave of 
your emotions," said Scientist 
Norcross complacently. "None of 
us are." 

"You — you are — ?" 

"Oh, yes. We generally don't 
speak of such things, but since 
I'm to introduce you to pseudolife, I can tell you that I died 
two years ago." 

"I'm afraid I never d : ■' >v 
— or Monica Drake Lane : — 

that is, I—" 

"You are Monica Drake 1 "»e. 
If you will sit quietly, 1 11 '.HI 
you about it." Scientist Noic*oss 
took two cigarettes from his reticule and offered the girl one. The 



DEAD END 



lip play was considered somewhat 
daring between the sexes, but under the circumstances he thought 
the mild narcotic would be good 
for her, as well as the sharpening 
of the senses brought on by actually smoking together. 

"When the Americans, who Inhabited this continent, gained 
domination of the world in the 
21st Century, they consolidated 
their position by carrying their 
customs to the ends of the Earth. 
For that matter, to Alpha Centauri, if the ships did get through. 

"Forgive me," he interrupted 
himself, "if I seem improper or 
even immoral in this little talk of 
ours. Believe me, it's not with an 
easy disregard of proprieties that 
I bring myself to speak of such 
things. 

"Well, the Americans believed, 
and rightly so, that death is a 
dreadful thing. Until Lewis and 
Havinghurst and Covalt developed pseudo-life, a great deal of 
time and effort and money went 
into such things as cemeteries — 
places where they literally buried 
their dead with elaborate ceremonials and much anguish. They 
had other equally wasteful practices, such as madhouses and 
jails, which were done away with 
when it became practical to replace a useless person with another, who matched the original 
to near absolute perfection, but 
Without fatal flaws of body or 



weaknesses of the mind. 

"Emphasis has shifted since 
those early years, when the abnormals were dealt with, to the 
comforting of human beings. 
Should John Davis Drumstetter 
suffer greatly at the loss of his 
mentor, the man who guided him 
in the ways of science? Of course 
not. He never knew I died." 

Norcross puffed complacently, 
sending iridescent rainbow smoke 
rings over the mind machine. 

"And I am his fiancee," said the 
girl. 

"Should he suffer because you 
died? No reason for it," said Norcross heartily. "A psychic trauma 
of that nature would make him 
desperately unhappy. Happiness 
is the proper state in life, as 
everyone knows. In fact, you will 
make him much happier than 
Monica Drake Lane, the original, 
ever could." 

"Yes, I shall be happy," mused 
the girl, as if feeling a more limited capacity for sorrow within 
herself. "But you spoke of a 
minus-one factor." 

"Yes, it takes in a lot of things. 
Though we are immortal, barring 
accidents, and we retain all the 
knowledge we had as human beings, the flaw to pseudo-life is 
that no original thought is possible. Students of the matter compare it to glancing at a page in 
a dictionary. Of course you don't 
consciously remember the word* 




 



there, but in pseudo-life you are 
capable of remembering and using them properly, so to speak, 
but not using them creatively. 
That is our trouble with John 
Davis Drumstetter. I was a brilliant physicist, but the understanding of new problems is beyond my limitations, and he is 
beyond me." 

"But I woke in New York," she 
said irrelevantly. 

"Because your master pseudolife file was kept there," explained 
Scientist Norcross. "As a human 
being, you were required to visit 
the psych lab every month, 
where your changed pattern was 
recorded by the mind machine. 
The pseudo-life girt could never 
lose more than a month of the 
human being's life. What was 
your regular appointment date?" 

"The 21st." 

"Let's see — you died yesterday, 
so that would be only three days 
gone. We're very fortunate." 

"But won*t he notice a difference in me?" 

"Absolutely not." 

"Am I — still capable of love?" 

Scientist Norcross blew a 
plume of rainbow smoke into the 
air. "Suppose, my dear, we find 
out." 

Monica Drake Lane agreed, for 
morality, which is essentially organized taboo that changes as 
society changes, had, in the 26th 
Century, been confined exclusive


ly to eating. Scientist Norcross 
had often amused himself by imagining how people of other ages 
would have been outraged by the 
moral standards of his own era, 
but his famous sense of humor 
was not rugged enough to be 
amused by the moral standards 
of the past. Not, at any rate, if 
he had had to endure them, 
though he found them sufficiently 
comic as history. 

She built a bower, an attractive 
courtship custom that had been 
adopted from the birds, and the 
day ended much more pleasantly 
than Scientist Norcross had expected at lunch. 

T^H E reports ca me i n f ram 
Prime Center. Drumstetter 
stayed in Los Angeles two days, 
in San Francisco three, and then 
consulted with Dowson in Honolulu. He skipped to New Zealand, 
back north to Japan, and swung 
across Siberia with short stops at 
various laboratories and universities. He was in Finland for three 
days with old Scientist Theophil 
Gertsley, who. though little better than a witch doctor, called 
himself a psychologist. 

When John Davis Drumstetter 
set his skip down beside the live 
oak tree, Scientist Norcross and 
Monica Drake Lane were waiting 
for him. He was gaunt from hunger and weary from travel, but 
the expression in his eyes was

not one to be assuaged by any 
food cubicle. Nor was "it love he 
had been seeking and not found, 
for Prime Center had seen to it 
that opportunities were offered, 
from austere tropical girls to the 
warmth -seeking women of the 
north, who would even eat with 
a member of the opposite sex. 

He greeted Scientist Norcross 
and his fiancee with an offhandedness that Norcross had not expected, and asked that he be 
excused from any long immediate 
association with thtm, due to the 
press of uncompleted work. 

"But,. Johnny," said Monica 
Drske Lane, "I've made a bower 
close by, and you seem very 
tired." 

"There's work to be done," said 
the young man firmly. "1 have 
no time to — Wait. I'll see your 
bower." 

As they walked over the lush 
artificial grass, Scientist Norcross 
explained that his results from 
the overdrive relay equations 
were in the mind machine even 
now, but John Davis Drumstetter 
only patted him on the shoulder 
in a friendly way and told him 
not to bother. 

When they reached the bower. 
Scientist Norcross expected that 
Drumstetter would sleep there 
after all, for it was an exceptionally pleasant design. The force 
field was night, and the sky was 
filled with adapted crt&tures from 



Mars dancing to their susurrate 
music, and the air was permeated 
with the bitter-sweet and exciting 
scent of a Venusian lake, the very 
odor of romance. In the background was the song of the sea. 

John Davis Drumstetter stepped out of the bower and said 
gently, "It's one of the nicest I've 
ever seen, and we spent some 
happy nights in it a year ago, 
didn't we, Monica?" 

He kissed her gently, as he 
might kiss a child, and walked 
back to the oak tree. 

"He's behaving very oddly," 
reported Norcross to Prime Center, as soon as he could, and gave 
the details. 

"I'd give a lot to have him 
meet a human female," said 
Piime Center wistfully. 

"What shall I do?" 

"Stay with him and wait,** 
ordered Prime Center. "This is 
the first time the hopes of humanity lie in one man. Remember 
that. We can only serve," he 
added bitterly. "He hasn't tested 
the final limitation? Good. Keep 
me informed." 

JOHN DAVIS DRUMSTETTER stayed beside his huge 
mind machine for nearly a week, 
and, though he was only sixty, 
he looked like an old man when 
he greeted Monica and Norcross 
at the end of that time. 

"The relay is finished," he an

nounced. "It's being installed in 
the Last Hope now. That's what 
I'm calling my ship, the ship to 
make mankind free of the stars. 
My work on Earth is nearly 
done." 

"But, Johnny darling," said 
Monica Drake Lane, looking up 
at him through her eyelashes, 
"what about our marriage?" 

He looked at her with grim 
pity. "The bower was an old 
bower," he answered. "Did you 
have the courage to be a unique 
in a patterned world? Can you 
reproduce, Monica Drake Lane?" 

"Oh, Johnny — " 

"The final limitation!" he said. 
"Humans have the power to command pseudo-life. Pseudo-life, 
answer! I command!" 

She sank to the ground. 

"No," she said, "no. Johnny. I 
can't have a baby. I died over 
a month ago. I'm sorry you found 
©ut." 

John Davis Drumstetter turned 
on Scientist William Manning 
Norcross. "You've done no new 
work because you have no capacity for it. Correct? Answer, 
pseudo-life, I command!" 

Norcross lifted a calm face. 
"Why, yes," he said, "I'm pseudolife. Have been for over two years. 
TTut don't you worry, Johnny, it's 
■ Stter this way and only natural 
that— " 

John Davis Drumstetter paid 
no attention. He spoke as if ex


plaining to himself. "You see, 
they're pseudo-life, dancing to the 
very end of the masquerade ball 
that started so long ago. It began when measurable science, the 
science of finity, made a finite 
man, a man nearly as good. It 
was the mental climate of an 
age that wanted its books digested, and then abandoned rt tiding for television. They froze 
food and precooked it and said 
it was even better than garden 
fresh vegetables. 

"Do it the easy way, they said, 
never knowing that the hard way 
is the only way in the last analysis. Why try to cure a neurotic 
when you can make a pseudo-life 
of him? Don't let his grieving 
friends and relations suffer; provide them with a pseudo-life. 
He's just the same, they said, and 
he's not sick. And should a man 
die? Oh, no! Make a pseudo-life 
for his wife and children." 

"But, Johnny — " 

"Be still, \ pseudo-life! Why 
bother with men who were beginning to understand the human 
mind, when you can create 
pseudo-life? The cheap drives out 
the good every time. Oh, with the 
kindliest intentions, with the softest sympathies! Hide. Conceal. 
The truth be damned!" 

"But, Johnny darling — " began 
Monica Drake Lane. 

"Be still, pseudo-life. There's 
one more thing, the final capstone

to mankind's pyramid of folly." 
He got Prime Center on the communication. "Answer, pseudolife, I command. Am I the last 
human being on Earth?" 

"Since you put it that way," 
•aid Prime Center reluctantly, 
**you are." . 

"And in the Solar System?" 

"I'm afraid so." 

The communication dropped 
from John Davis Drumstetter's 
band. 

"This is the logical conclusion," 
he said slowly. "The actors are 
playing on a stage of worlds for 
an audience of one. At the solar 
observatory on Mercury, astronomers study the Sun and send in 
their reports, in case I should 
glance at them. In the mines of 
Pluto, miners dig ore to provide 
a market quotation I might see 
in the telepapers." 

He kicked the communication 
■cross the floor. 

"Get out," he told them with 
infinite weariness. "The last human being commands." 

HE slept for a day and had 
breakfast in full public view 
under a tree. Peeping Toms of 
both sexes watched him. 

Prime Center appeared in person just as he finished mopping 
up the last of his once-over Jightly egg. Prime Center coughed 
and blushed and looked away, 
and John Davis Drumstetter 



laughed aloud, humorlessly. 

"Good morning," he said cheerfully. 

"Hm, yes," said Prime Center. 

"Sit down. Have an egg?" A 
jvicked light appeared in his eyes, 
and he went on in a low, sinister 
voice, "A coddled egg. soft and 
white and runny? Maybe you 
want to gulp some coffee? Or 
snap your way through a piece of 
crackling toast? No?" His guest 
was turning pale and sick-looking. "Well, let me finish this bacon, and state your business." 

He threw back his head and 
slipped the bacon into his mouth. 
Prime Center shuddered. 

"Scientist Drumstette r," he 
said, keeping his gaze fixed on 
the trunk of the tree, *'I have 
come to offer you all the worlds. 
Yes, the whole Solar System, including the asteroids and Pluto. 
You will be more powerful than 
Alexander or Caesar or Stalin or 
O'Toole. We will create a new 
office — Prime Squared Center — 
to rule the Solar System. Do you 
mind not doing that?" 

John Davis Drumstetter was 
licking his fingers thoughtfully. 
He nodded. 

"Then you accept?" 

"No, I'm through licking my 
fingers. I'll give you your answer 
on a systemwide communication. 
Arrange it, pseudo-life, immediately." 

As a concession to morality, 



6AIAXY SCI EN CI FICTION 



John Davis Drumstetter agreed 
to step into a molecular cleanup 
booth. When he came out again, 
he spoke to the worlds and all the 
ships in space: 

"My friends, from now on the 
blind will lead the blind. Moral 
obliquity has triumphed and becomes common morality." He 
laughed and rubbed his nose, 
"I'm sorry. I was speaking to an 
audience of one — myself. What I 
want you billions to do is to continue your work, to maintain the 
system as it now stands. Pseudolife will be replaced with pseudolife till the end of time. It wiU he 
a static world. It will be a nearlyas-good world. It will be a pleasant world by your standards. I 
wish you to do this, and you 
must, of course, obey my command. My purpose reaches a 
little beyond your natural inclination; this system will serve as 
a fertile warning to any beings 
with intelligence who may come 
after me. 



**I will not be with you long, 
myself — " 

"Suicid -?" asked Prime Center 
hopefully. 

"Alpha Centaur i." said John 
Davis Drumstetter with a chuckle. 
"The colonists left because they 
didn't like pseudo-life, either. 
Good-by to you all." 

He snapped off the communication, waved to the little group 
under the tree, and entered the 
Last Hope. The entry port swung 
closed. The force field glowed, 
and then the ship was gone, leaving behind a whirlwind of dust. 

"Alphn Centauri?" asked Monica Drake Lane. 

"Following the others of his 
wild, unstable breed," said Scientist Norcross. 

"Easy come, easy go," the girl 
said, shrugging. 

Prime Center had the last 
word. "Yes, and good riddance. 
Human beings have always been 
a nuisance."

Problem: How con you arrange marriages with 

men in one solar system, women in another — 
and neither willing to Jeave his own world?

I 

^Uf ■ ^HE beasts aren't much 
I help, are they?" 
m Karl Allen snatched a 
breath of air and gave another 
heave on the line tied to the raft 
of parampa logs bobbing in the 
middle of the river. 

"No," he grunted, "they're not. 
They always balk at a time like 
this, when they can see it'll be 
hard work." 

Joseph Hill wiped his plump 
face and coiled some of the rope's 
slack around his thick waist. 

"Together now, Karl. One/ 
Two!" 

They stood knee-deep in mud 
on the bank, pulling and strain



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



§1 



ing on the rope, while somelew 
yards distant, in the shade of a 
grove of trees, their tiny yllumphs 
nibbled grass and watched them 
critically, but made no effort to 
come closer. 

"If we're late for ship's landing, Joe, we'll get crossed off the 
list." 

Hill puffed and wheezed and 
took another hitch on the rope. 

"That's what I've been thinking about," he said, worried. 

They took a deep breath and 
hauled mightily on the raft rope. 
The raft bobbed nearer. For a 
moment the swift waters of the 
Karazoo threatened to tear it out 
of their grasp, and then it was 
beached, most of it solidly, on the 
muddy bank. One end of it «till 
lay in the gurgling, rushing 
waters, but that didn't matter. 
They'd be back in ten hours or 
to. long before the heavy raft 
could be washed free. 

"How much time have we got, 
Karl?" 

The ground was thick with 
shadows, and Karl cast a critical 
eye at them. He estimated that 
even with the refusal of their 
yllumphs to help beach the raft, 
they still had a good two hours 
before the rocket put down at 
Landing City. 

"Two hours, maybe a little 
more," he stated hastily when 
Hill looked more worried. "Time 



enough to get to Landing City 
and put in for our numbers on 

the list." 

He turned back to the raft, 
untied the leather and horn saddles, and threw them over the 
backs of their reluctant mounts. 
He cinched his saddle and tied 
on some robes and furs behind it. 

Hill watched him curiously. 
"What are you taking the furs 
for? This isn't the trading 
rocket." 

"I know. I thought that when 
we come back tonight, it might 
be cold and maybe she'll appreciate the coverings then." 

"You never would have thought 
of it yourself," Hill grunted. 
"Grundy must have told you to 
do it, the old fool. If you ask me, 
the less you give tticm, the less 
they'll come to expect. Once you 
spoil them, they'll expect you to 
do all the trapping and the farming and the family-raising yourself." 

"You didn't have to sign up," 
Karl pointed out. "You could 
have applied for a wife from some 
different planet." 

"One's probably just as good 
as another. They'll all have to 
work the farms and raise families." 

Karl laughed and aimed a 
friendly blow at Hill. They finished saddling up and headed 
into the thick forest. 




 



TT was quiet as Karl guided his 
mount along the dimly marked 
trail and he caught himself thinking of the return trip he would 
be making that night. It would 
be nice to have somebody new 
to talk to. And it would be good 
to have somebody to help with 
the trapping and tanning, somebody who could tend the small 
vegetable garden at the rear of 
his shack and mend his socks and 
wash his clothes and cook his 
meals. 

And it was time, he thought 
soberly, that he started to raise a 
family. He was mid-twenty now, 
old enough to want a wife and 
children. 

"You going to raise a litter, 
Joe?" 

Hill started. Karl realized that 
he had probably been thinking 
of the same thing. 

''One of these days I'll need 
help around the sawmill," Hill 
answered defensively. "Need 
some kids to cut the trees, a 
couple more to pole them down 
the river, some to run the mill 
itself and maybe one to sell the 
lumber in Landing City. Can't do 
it all myself." 

He paused a moment, thinking 
over something that had just occurred to him. r 

"I've been thinking of your 
plans for a garden, Karl. Maybe 
I ought to have one for my wife 
to take care of, too." 



Karl chuckled. "I don't think 
she'll have the time!" 

They left the leafy expanse of 
the forest and entered the grasslands that sloped toward Landing 
City. He could even see Landing 
City itself on the horizon, a 
smudge of rusting, corrugated 
steel shacks, muddy streets, and 
the small rocket port — a scorched 
thirty acres or so fenced off with 
barbed wire. 

Karl looked out of the corner 
of his eye at Hill and felt a vague 
wave of uneasiness. Hill was a 
big, thick man wearing the soiled 
.clothes and bristly stubble of a 
man who was used to living alone 
and who liked it. But once he 
took a wife, he would probably 
have to keep himself in clean 
clothes and shave every few days. 
It was even possible that the 
woman might object to Hill letting his yllumph share the hut. 

The path was getting crowded, 
more of the colonists coming onto 
the main path from the small 
side trails. 

Hill broke the silence first. "I 
wonder what they'll be like." 

Karl looked wise and nodded 
knowingly. "They're Earthwomen, Joe. Earth!" 

It was easy to act as though he 
had some inside information, but 
Karl had to admit to himself 
that he actually knew very little 
about it. He was a Second System colonist and had never even 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



•een an Earth woman. He had 
heard tales, though, and even discounting a large percentage of 
them, some of them must have 
been true. Old Grundy at the 
rocket office, who should know 
about these things if anybody 
did, seemed disturbingly lacking 
on definite information, though 
he had hinted broadly enough. 
He'd whistle softly and wink an 
eye and repeat the stories that 
Karl had already heard; but he 
had nothing definite to offer, no 
real facts at all. 

Some of the other colonists 
whom they hadn't seen for the 
last few months shouted greetings, and Karl began to feel some 
of the carnival spirit. There was 
Jenkins, who had another trapping line fifty miles farther up 
the Karazoo: Leonard, who had 
the biggest farm on Midplanet; 
and then the fellow who specialized in catching and breaking in 
yllumphs, whose name Karl 
couldn't remember. 

"They say they're good workers," Hill said. 

Karl nodded. "Pretty, too." 

They threaded their way 
through the crowded and muddy 
Streets. Landing City wasn't big. 
compared to some of the cities 
on Altair, where he had been 
raised, but Karl was proud of it. 
Some day it would be as big as 
any city on any planet — maybe 
even have a population of ten 



thousand people or more. 

"Joe" Karl said suddenly, 
"what's supposed to make women 
from Earth better than women 
from any other world?" 

Hill located a faint itch and 
frowned. "I don't know, Karl, It's 
hard to say. They're — well, sophisticated, glamorous." 

Karl absorbed this in silence. 
Those particular qualities were, 
he thought, rather hard to define. 

The battered shack that served 
as rocket port office and headquarters for the colonial office 
on Midplanet loomed up in front 
of them. There was a crowd gathered in front of the building and 
they forced their way through to 
see what had caused it. 

"We saw this the last time we 
were here," Hill said. 

**I know," Karl agreed, "but 
I want to take another look." He 
was anxious to glean all the information that he could. 

It was a poster of a beautiful 
woman leaning toward the viewer. The edges of the poster were 
curling and the colors had faded 
during the last six months, but 
the girl's smile seemed just as inviting as ever. She held a longstemmed goblet in one hand and 
was blowing a kiss to her audience with the other. Her 
eyes sparkled, her smile was provocative. A quoted sentence read: 
"I'm from Earth!" There was 
nothing more except a printed 



84 




 



list of the different solar systems 
to which the colonial office was 
sending the women. 

She was real pretty, Karl 
thought. A little on the thin side, 
maybe, and the dress she was 
wearing would hardly be practical on Midplanet, but she had a 
certain something. Glamor, maybe? 

A loudspeaker blared. 

"All colonists waiting for the 
wife draft assemble for your 
numbers! All colonists . . .** 

There was a jostling for places 
an<f then they were in the rapidly 
moving line. Grundy, fat and important-looking, was handing out 



little blue slips with numbers on 
them, pausing every now and 
then to tell them some entertaining bit of information about the 
women. He had a great imagina* 
tion, nothing else. 

Karl drew the number 53 and 
hurried to the grassy lot beside 
the landing field that had been 
decorated with bunting and huge 
welcome signs for the new arrivals. A table was loaded with 
government pamphlets meant to 
be helpful to newly married colonists. Karl went over and stvffed 
a few in his pockets. Other tnbles 
had been set out and were loaded 
with luncheon food, fixed by the 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



few colonial women in the community. Karl caught himself 
eying the women closely, wondering how the girls from Earth 
would compare with them. 

He fingered the ticket in his 
pocket. What would the woman 
be like who had drawn the companion number 53 aboard the 
rocket? For when it landed, they 
would pair up by numbers. The 
method had its drawbacks, of 
course, but time was much too 
short to allow even a few days of 
getting acquainted. He'd have to 
get back to his trapping lines and 
he imagined that Hill would have 
to get back to his sawmill and 
the others to their farms. What 
the hell, you never knew what 
you were getting either way, till 
it was too late. 

"Sandwich, mister? Pop?" 

Karl flipped the boy a coin, 
picked up some food and a drink, 
and wandered over to the landing 
field with Hill. There were still 
ten minutes or so to go before 
the rocket landed, but he caught 
himself straining his sight at the 
blue sky, trying to see a telltale 
flicker of exhaust flame. 

The field was crowded and he 
caught some of the buzzing conversation. 

". . . never knew one myself, 
but let me tell you ..." 

. . knew a fellow once who 
married one, never had a moment's rest afterward . . .** 



"... no comparison with colonial women. They got culture . . .** 

". . . I'd give a lot to know the 
girl who's got number twentyfive . . ." 

"Let's meet back here with the 
girls who have picked our numbers," Hill said. "Maybe we 
could trade." 

Karl nodded, though privately 
he felt that the number system 
was just as good as depending on 
first impressions. 

There was a murmur from the 
crowd and he found his gaze riveted overhead. High above, in 
the misty blue sky, was a sudden 
twinkle of fire. 

He reached up and wiped his 
sweaty face with a muddy hand 
and brushed aside a straggly lock 
of tangled hair. It wouldn't hurt 
to try to took his best. 

The twinkling fire came nearer. 

II 

" A MR. MacDONALD to see 
you, Mr. Escher," 

Claude Escher flipped the intercom switch. 

"Please send him right in." 

That was entirely superfluous, 
he thought, because MacDonalrJ 
would come in whether Escher 
wanted him to or not. 
, The door opened and shut with 
a slightly harder bang than usual 
and Escher mentally braced him

self. He had a good hunch what 
the problem was going to be and 
why it was being thrown jn their 
laps. 

MacOonald made himself comfortable and sat there for a few 
minutes, just looking grim and 
not saying anything. Escher knew 
the psychology by heart. A short 
preliminary silence is always 
more effective in browbeating 
subordinates than an initial furious bluster; 

He lit a cigarette and tried to 
outwait MacDonald. It wasn't 
easy — ■ MacDonald had great 
staying powers, which was probably why he was the head of the 
department. 

Escher gave in first. "Okay, 
Mac, what's the trouble? What 
do we have tossed in our laps 
now?" 

"You know the one — colonization problem. You know that 
when we first started to colonize, 
quite a large percentage of the 
male population took to the stars, 
as the saying goes. The adventuresome, the gamblers, the 
frontier type all decided they 
wanted to head for other worlds, 
to get away from it all. The male 
of the species is far more adventuresome than the female; the 
tiien left — but the women didn't. 
At least, not in nearly the same 
lf*rge numbers. 

"Well, you see the problem. 
The ratio of women to men here 



on Eafth is now something like 
five to three. If you don't know 
what that means, ask any man 
with a daughter. Or any psychiatrist. Husband -hunting isn't just 
a pleasant pastime on Earth. It's 
an earnest cutthroat business and 
I'm not just using a literary 
phrase." 

He threw a paper on Esther's 
desk. "You'll find most of the 
statistics about it in that, Claude. 
Notice the increase in crimes peculiar to women. Shoplifting, 
badger games, poisonings, that 
kind of thing. It's quite a list. 
You'll also notice the huge increase in petty crimes, a lot of 
which wouldn't have bothered 
the courts before. In fact, they 
wouldn't even have been considered crimes. You know why they 
are now?" 

Escher shook his head blankly. 

"Most of the girls in the past 
who didn't catch a husband," 
MacDonald continued, "grew up 
to be the type of old maid who's 
dedicated to improving the morals and what-not of the rest of 
the population. We've got more 
puritanical societies now than we 
ever had, and we have more silly 
little laws on the books as a result. You can be thrown in the 
pokey for things like violating a 
woman's privacy — whatever that 
means— and she's the one who 
decides whether what you say or 
do is a violation or not." 



THE O I ■ L S FIOM EARTH

Escher looked bored. "Not to 
mention the new prohibition 
which forbids the use of alcohol 
in everything from cough medicines to hair tonics. Or the 
cleaned up moral code that recks 
—if you'll pardon the expression 
— of purity. Sure, I know what 
you mean. And you know the 
solution. All we have to do is get 
the women to colonize." 

MacDonald ran his fingers nervously through his hair. 

"But it won't be easy, and 
that's why it's been given to us. 
It's your baby, Claude. Give it a 
lot of thought. Nothing's impossible, you know." 

"Perpetual motion machines 
are," Escher said quietly. "And 
pulling yourself up by your bootstraps. But I get the point. Nevertheless, women just don't want 
to colonize. And who can blame 
them? Why should they give up 
living in a luxury civilization, 
with as many modern conveniences as this one, to go homesteading on some wild, unexplored planet where they have to 
work their fingers to the bone and 
play footsie with wild animals 
and savages who would just as 
soon skin them alive as not?" 

"What do you advise I do, 
then?" MacDonald demanded. 
"Go back to the Board and tell 
them the problem is not solvable, 
that we can't think of anything?" 

Escher looked hurt. "Did I say 



that? I just said it wouldn't be 

easy." 

"The Board is giving ^ou a 
blank check. Do anything you 
think will pay off. We have to 
stay within the letter of the law, 
of course, but not necessarily the 
spirit." 

"When do they have to have a 
solution?" 

"As soon as possible. At least 
within the year. By that time the 
situation will be very serious. The 
psychologists say that what will 
happen then won't be good." 

"All right,_ by then we'll have 
the answer." 

MacDonald stopped at the 
door. "There's another reason 
why they want it worked out. 
The number of men applying to 
the Colonization Board for emigration to the colony planets is 
falling off." 

"How come?" 

MacDonald smiled. "On the 
basis of statistics alone, would 
you want to emigrate from a 
planet where the women outnumber the men five to three?" 

When MacDonald had gone, 
Escher settled back in his chair 
and idly tapped his fingers on 
the desk-top. It was lucky that 
the Colonization Board worked 
on two levels. One was the wellpublicized, idealistic level where 
nothing was too good and every 
deal was 99 and 44/100 per cent 
pure. But when things got too 



GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



difficult for it to handle on that 
level, they went to Escher and 
MacDonald's department The 
coal mine level. Nothing was too 
low, so long as it worked. Of 
course, if it didn't work, you took 
the lumps, too. 

He rummaged around in his 
drawer and found a list of the 
qualifications set up by the Board 
for potential colonists. He read 
the list slowly and frowned. You 
had to be physically fit for the 
rigors of space travel, naturally, 
but some of the qualifications 
were obviously silly. You couldn't 
guarantee physical perfection in 
the second generation, anyway. 

He tore the qualification list in 
shreds and dropped it in the disposal chute. That would have to 
be the first to go. 

There were other things that 
could be done immediately. For 
One thing, as it stood now, you 
were supposed to be financially 
able to colonize. Obviously a stupid and unappealing law. That 
would have to go next. 

He picked up the sheet of statistics that MacDonald had left 
and read it carefully. The Board 
could legalize polygamy, but that 
was no solution in the long run. 
Probably cause more problems 
than it would solve. Even with 
women as easy to handle as they 
were nowadays, one was still 
enough. 

Which still left him with the 



main problem of how to get people to colonize who didn't want 
to colonize. 

The first point was to convince 
them that they wanted to. The 
second point was that it might 
not matter whether they wanted 
to or not. 

No, it shouldn't be hard to 
solve at all — provided you held 
your nose, silenced your conscience, and were willing to forget that there was such a thing as 
a moral code.

OHYLLIS HANSON put the 
cover over her typewriter and 
locked the correspondence drawer. Another day was done, another evening about to begin. 

She filed into the washroom 
with the-other girls and carefully 
redid her face. It was getting hard 
to disguise the worry lines, to 
paint away the faint crow's-feet 
around her eyes. 

She wasn't, she admitted to 
herself for the thousandth time, 
what you would call beautiful. 
She inspected herself carefully in 
her compact mirror. In a sudden 
flash of honesty, she had to admit 
that she wasn't even what you 
would call pretty. Her face was 
too broad, her nose a fraction too 
long, and her hair was dull. Not 
homely, exactly — but not pretty, 
either. 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH

Conversation hummed around 
her, most of it from the little 
group in the corner, where the 
extreme few who were married 
sat as practically a race apart. 
Their advice was sought, their 
suggestions avidly followed. 

"Going out tonight, Phyl?" 

She hesitated a moment, then " 
slowly painted on the rest of her 
mouth. The question was technically a privacy violator, but she 
thought she would sidestep it this 
time, instead of refusing to answer point-blank. 

"I thought I'd stay home tonight. Have a few things I want 
to rinse out." 

The black-haired girl next to 
her nodded sympathetically. 
"Sure, Phyl, I know what you 
mean. Just like the rest of us — 
waiting for the phone to ring." 

Phyllis finished washing up 
find then left the office, carefully 
noting the girl who was waiting 
for the boss. The girl was beautiful in a hard sort of way, a platinum blonde with an entertainer's 
busty figure. Waiting for a 
plump, middle-aged man like a 
stagestruck kid outside a theatre. 

At home, in her small tworoom bachelor-girl apartment, 
•he stripped and took a hot, sudsing shower, then stepped out and 
toweled herself in front of a mirror. She frowned slightly. You 
didn't know whether you should 
keep yourself in trim just on some 



off-chance, or give up and let 
yourself go. 

She fixed dinner, took a moderately long time doing the 
dishes, and went throu gh the 
standard routine of getting a 
book and curling up on the sofa. 
It was a good book of the bootlegged variety — scientifically 
written with enough surplus 
heroes and heroines and lushly 
described love affairs to hold anybody's interest. 

It held hers for ten pages and 
then she threw the book across 
the room, getting a savage delight at the way the pages ripped 
and Muttered to the Moor. 

What was the use of kidding 
herself any longer, of trying to 
live vicariously and hoping that 
some day she would have a home 
and a husband? She was thirty 
now; the phone hadn't rung in 
the last three years. She might as 
well spend this evening as she 
had spent so many others — call 
up the girls for a bridge game and 
a little gossip, though heaven 
knew you always ended up envying the people you were gossiping 
about. 

Perhaps she should have joined 
one of the organizations at the 
office that did something like that 
seven nights out of every seven, 
A bridge game or a benefit for 
some school or a talk on art. Or 
v she could have joined the Lecture 
of the Week club, or the YWCA, 




 



or any one of the other government-sponsored clubs designed to 
fill the void in a woman's life. 

But bridge games and benefits 
and lectures didn't take the place 
of a husband and family. She was 
kidding herself again. 

She got up and retrieved the 
battered book, then went over to 
the mail slot. She hadn't had time 
to open her mail that morning; 
most of the time it wasn't worth 
the effort. Advertisements for 
book clubs, lecture clubs, how to 
win at bridge and canasta . . . 

Her fingers sprang the metal 
tabs on a large envelope and she 
took out the contents and spread 
it wide. 

She gasped. It was a large 
poster, about a yard square. A 
man was on it, straddling a tiny 
city and a small panorama of 
farms and forests at his feet. He 
was a handsome specimen, with 
wavy blond hair and blue eyes 
and a curly mat on his bare chest 
that was just enough to be attractive without being apelike. He 
held an axe in his hands and was 
eying her with a clearly inviting 
look of brazen self-confidence. 

It was definitely a privacy violator and she should notify the 
authorities immediately! 

Bright lettering at the top of 
the poster shrieked: "Come to 
the Colonies, the Planets of Romance 1" 

Whoever had mailed it should 



be arrested and imprisoned! Prey' 
ing on . . . 

The smaller print at the bottom was mostly full of facts and 
figures. The need for women out 
on the colony planets, the percentage of men to women — a 
startling disproportion — the comfortable cities that weren't nearly 
as primitive as people had imagined, and the recently reduced 
qualifications. 

She caught herself admiring 
the man on the poster. Naturally, 
it was an artist's conception, but 
even so . . . 

And the cities were far in advance of the frontier settlements, 
where you had to battle disease 
and dirty savages. 

It was all a dream. She had 
never done anything like this and 
she wouldn't think of doing it 
now. And had any of her friends 
seen the poster? Of course, they 
probably wouldn't tell her even if 
they had. 

Bur the poster was a violation 
of privacy. Whoever had sent it 
had taken advantage of information that was none of their business. It was up to her to notify 
the authorities! 

QHE took another look at the 
^ poster. 

The letter she finally finished 
writing was very short. She addressed it to the box number in 
the upper left-hand corner of the 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



9\ 




plain wrapper that the poster 
had come in. 

IV 

HpHE dress lay on the counter, 
a small corner of it trailing 
off the edge. It was a beautiful 
thing, sheer sheen satin trimmed 
in gold nylon thread. It was the 
kind of gown that would make 
anybody who wore it look beautiful. The price was high, much 
too high for her to pay. She knew 
she would never be able to buy 
it. 

But she didn't intend to buy it. 

She looked casually around 
and noted that nobody was 
watching her. There was another 
woman a few counters down and 
a man, obviously embarrassed, at 
the lingerie counter. Nobody else 
was in sight. It was a perfect 
time. The clerk had left to look 
up a difficult item that she had 
purposely asked for and probably 
wouldn't be back for five minutes. 

Time enough, at any rate. 

The dress was lying loose, so 
she didn't have to pry it off any 
hangers. She took another quick 
look around, then hurriedly bundled it up and dropped it in her 
shopping bag. 

She had taken two self-assured 
steps away from the counter 
when she felt a hand on her 
shoulder. The grip was firm and 
muscular and she knew she had 




 



lost the game. She also knew that 
she had to play it out to the end, 
to grasp any straw. 

"Let go of me!" she ordered in 
' a frostily offended voice. 

"Sorry, miss," the man said 
politely, "but I think we have a 
short trip to take." 

She thought for a moment of 
brazening it out further and then 
gave up. She'd get a few weeks or 
months in the local detention 
building, a probing into her background for the psychological reasons that prompted her to steal, 
and then she'd be out again. 

They couldn't do anything to 
her that mattered. 

She shrugged and followed the 
detective calmly. None of the 
shoppers had looked up. None 
seemed to notice anything out of 
the ordinary. 

In the detention building she 
thanked her good luck that she 
was facing a man for the sentence, instead of one of the puritanical old biddies who served 
on the bench. She even found a 
certain satisfaction in the presence of the cigar smoke and the 
blunt, earthy language that 
floated in from the corridor. 

"Why did you steal it?" the 
judge asked. He held up the 
dress, which, she noted furiously, 
didn't look nearly as nice as it 
had under the department store 
lights. 

"I don't have anything to say," 



she said. "I want to see a lawyer.** 
She could imagine what he was 
thinking. Another tough one, another plain jane who was shoplifting for a thrill. 

And she probably was. You 
had to do something nowadays. 
You couldn't just sit home and 
chew your fingernails, or run out 
and listen to the endless boring 
lectures on art and culture. 

"Name?" he asked in a tired 
voice. 

She knew the statistics he 
wanted. "Ruby Johnson, 32, 145 
pounds, brown hair and green 
eyes. Prints on file." 

The judge leaned down and 
mentioned something to the bailiff, who left and presently came 
back with a ledger. The judge 
opened it and ran his fingers 
down one of the pages. 

The sentence would probably 
be the usual, she thought — six 
months and a fine, or perhaps a 
little more when they found out 
she had a record for shoplifting. 

A stranger in the courtroom in 
the official linens of the government suddenly stepped up beside 
the judge and looked at the page. 
She could hear a little of what he 
said : 

. . anxiety neurosis . . . obvious feeling of not being wanted 
. . . probably steals to attract attention . . . recommend emigration." 

"In view of some complicating 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



93 



factors, we're going to give you a 
choice," the judge finally said. 
**You can either go to the penitentiary for ten years and pay a 
$10,000 fine, or you can ship out 
to the colony planets and receive 
a five-hundred-dollar immigration bonus." 

She thought for a minute that 
she hadn't heard right. Ten thousand dollars and ten years! It 
was obvious that the state was 
interested in neither the fine nor 
in paying her room and board for 
ten years. She could recognize a 
squeeze play when she saw it, 
but there was nothing she could 
do about it. 

"I wouldn't call that a choice," 
she said sourly. "I'll ship out."

SUZANNE was proud of the 
apartment. It had all the 
modern conveniences, like the 
needle shower with the perfume 
dispenser, the built-in soft-drink 
bar in the library, the all-communications set, and the electrical 
massager. It was a nice, comfortable setup, an illusion of security in an ever-changing world. 

She lit a cigarette and chuckled. 
Mrs. Burger, the fat old landlady, 
thought she kept up the apartment by working as a buyer for 
one of the downtown stores. 

Well, maybe some day she 
would. 



But not today. And not tonight. 

The phone rang and she answered in a casual tone, She 
talked for a minute, then let a 
trace of sultriness creep into her 
voice, The conversation wasn't 
long. 

She let the receiver fall back 
on the base and went into the 
bedroom to get a hat box. She 
wouldn't need much; she'd probably be back that same night. 

It was a nice night and since 
the address was only a few blocks 
away, she decided to walk it. She 
blithely ignored the curious stares 
from other pedestrians, attracted 
by the sharp, clicking sound of 
her heels on the sidewalk. 

The address was a brownstone 
that looked more like an office 
building than anything else, but 
then you could never tell. She 
pressed the buzzer and waited a 
moment for the sound to echo 
back and forth on the inside. She 
pressed it again and a moment 
later a suave young man appeared in the doorway. 

"Miss Carstens?" 

She smiled pertly. 

"We've been expecting you." 

She wondered a little at the 
"we," but dutifully smiled and 
followed him in. 

The glare of the lights inside 
the office blinded her for a moment. When she could focus them 
again, her smile became slightly 
blurry at the edges and then dis



 



appeared entirely. She wasn't 
alone. There was a battery of 
■ chairs against one side of the 
room. She recognized most of the 
girls sitting in them. 

She forced a smile to her lips 
and tried to laugh. 

"I'm sure there's been some 
mistake! Why, I never . . ." 

The young man coughed politely. "I'm afraid there's been no 
mistake. Full name, please." 

"Suzanne Carstens," she said 
grimly, and gave the other statistics he wanted. She idly won-i 
dered what stoolie had peddled 
the phone numbers. 

"Suzanne Carstens," the young 
man noted, and slowly shook his 
head. "A very pretty name, but 
no doubt not your own. It actually doesn't matter, though. Take 
a seat over there." 

She did as he asked and he 
faced the entire group. 

"I and the other gentlemen 
here represent the Colonization 
Board. We've interceded with the 
local authorities in order to offer 
you a choice. We would like to 
ship you out to the colony planets. Naturally, we will pay you 
the standard emigration bonus of 
five hundred dollars. The colonists need wives; they offer you 
—security." 

, He stressed the word slightly. 

"Now, of course, if you don't 
prefer the colony planets, you 
can stay behind and face the pen


alties of ten years in jail and a 
fine of ten thousand dollars." 

Suzanne felt that her lower jaw 
needed support. Ten thousand 
dollars and ten years! And in 
either case she'd lose the apartment she had worked so hard for, 
her symbol of security. 

"Well, what do you say?" 
There was a dead silence. The 
young man from the Colonization 
Board turned to Suzanne. "How 
about you, Miss Carstens?" 

She smiled sickly and nodded 
her head. "I love to travel!" she 
said. 

It didn't sound at alt witty 
even to herself.

HpHE transfer shed was a vast 
and somber terminal, cold 
and impersonal. There was a 
cleared space at the center of the 
floor where the officials had desks 
and tables and rows of filing cabinets and busily clicking machinery. The women sat huddled 
around the edges of the shed, 
waiting to be called to the center 
and assigned to any of the various colony planets. 

Phyllis clutched her small suitcase, containing the few personal 
items she had been allowed to 
take on the trip, and silently 
swore that once she set foot on 
another planet, she'd never leave 
it, no matter what.

"Draft 49 for the Huffer Solar 
System report to the routing 
desk! Draft 49 for the Huffer 
Solar System report to the routing desk!" 

"That's us," Suzanne said 
drily. She and Phyllis and Ruby 
joined the others out on the floor. 

"You understand," the routing 
official was saying, "that you're 
allowed your choice of planets 
in the Huffer Solar System. We'll 
read off occupational and other 
pertinent information and then 
you make your choice. 

"Sunside: First planet from the 
system sun. Warm, humid climate. Fishing, flower-growing for 
export, mining, and natural 
handicrafts. Population ratio 7 
to 1, males all somatypes and 
admixtures. 

"Midplanet: Second planet 
out. Temperate climate. Farming, fur-trapping, slight manufacturing. Ratio 7 to 1, all somatypes and admixtures." 

"Newman's body, last planet 
out from the system sun . . ." 

He finished the list and gave 
them five minutes to decide. The 
names of the three planets appeared on the floor in glowing 
letters. When they had made up 
their minds, they were to go and 
stand on the name. 

They held a short conference. 

"It looks like it's a tossup between fish and furs," l?uby said. 
"I think I'll take Midplanet. I 



like furs better than fish." 

They argued a moment longer, 
then picked up their belongings 
and went and stood on the luminous letters. 

VII 

NO doubt of it, the carpet made 
a fairly suitable green, Escher 
thought. He placed the ball firmly on the nap, stepped back a 
pace, and tapped it smartly with 
the golf club. It rolled in a beautifully straight path into the upturned water glass, 

"Very nice shot, Claude." 
Escher looked up and leaned 
the club against the side of the 
desk. 

"I thought so, too," he Agreed. 
"What brings you here, Mac?" 

MacDoneld sat down and 
poured himself a glass of water 
from the beaker on Escher*s desk. 

"Just wanted to pass on the 
compliments of the Board for the 
recent large upswing in woman 
emigrants to the colony planets.** 

Escher casually waved it aside. 

"It wasn't much. We just had 
to rid ourselves of some oldfashioned notions, that's all. I 

was afraid, though, that the 
Board might disapprove of our 
methods." 

MacDonald thought for a moment. 

"No, 1 guess they didn't. I 
caa't recall any members of the 



N 




 



Board complaining about it, at 
least. Apparently they felt that 
something drastic was needed. Or, 
more probably, they've kept 
themselves carefully ignorant of 
just how we did it. Oh, they know 
we violated privacy in a lot of 
cases, but they're willing to overlook it." 

"Very white of them, I'm 
sure," Escher grunted. He took 
up the club and set the ball back 
on its carpet tee. "How about a 
game tomorrow afternoon?" 

MacDonald shook his head. "It 
didn't bother the Board much, 
Claude, but I followed your advertising and I was down to the 
port to see a contingent of our 
new colonists take off. It bothers 
me, Claude. The ads you sent to 
the different planets, the whispering campaign we arranged for, 
the subtle propaganda we sent 
out — and then the women. Don't 
yon think there will be some sort 
of howl? We've definitely led 
them to believe one thing and 
here we're sending them — well, 
the new colonists leave a lot to 
be desired." 

Escher looked at him coldly. 
"Look, Mac, let's be cynical 
about this. That's why it was referred to us in the first place. Of 
course the girls we sent aren't the 
most beautiful or the most glamorous. Those girls are already 
married and you couldn't get 
them to leave, no matter what 



you did. The girls we sent are 
the ones who weren't wanted here 
on Earth. We even killed two 
birds with one stone and solved 
the crime problem." 

He held up his hand when 
MacDonald started to object. 

"Don't say it. Mac. Stop and 
think for a moment. What danger 
can a shoplifter do on a colony 
planet? There's nothing to steal. 
And without large cities, most 
other types of crime will have 
equally tough sledding. Besides, 
we eliminated those who had 
natural criminal tendencies. Most 
of the others had drifted into it 
as an outlet for their sense of 
insecurity, the feeling of not being 
wanted." 

MacDonald looked worried. 

"All right, what happens when 
the colonists find out, Claude? 
What happens when they find 
out we shipped them the castoffs, 
the leftovers?" 

"The point is, Mac, they'll 
never find out. They're Second 
System colonists. You know how 
the Colonization Board works. 
Planet A colonizes planet B. 
Planet B colonizes planet C. 
Given a suitable number of generations, the people on planet C 
will never have seen people from 
planet A. Earth is planet A. the 
colony planets to which the 
women were sent are all planet 
Cs. 

"You sec, the catch is that ihe 



THE GIRLS FROM EARTH 



97 



colonists will have no basis on 
which to make comparisons. 
They've never seen women from 
Earth!" 

"I still don't like it. They- have 
seen women from other planets. 
After taking a look at the last 
shipload of females that left 
Earth, I'm still worried." 

Escher laughed. "That's because you haven't seen some of 
the colony women, Mac. Tell me, 
what is the most cultured and 
socially up-to-date planet? Earth, 
of course. Now on what planet 
has husband-hunting and pleasing been developed into an allout struggle with fine scientific 
techniques? Earth, again. The 
colonists don't have a chance. 

"When it comes to catching 
and pleasing the male, the girls 
from Earth have really had an 
education. They can take care 
of themselves. Don't worry about 
that. Who's to tell the colonists 
the girls aren't the cream of the 
crop, anyway? Not the girls 
themselves, certainly. And not 
us. I tell you they'll never find 
out, Mac." 

"You're positive that the colonists will be pleased with the 
women?" 

Escher hesitated. "Well, reasonably." He sounded a little 
wistful He practiced his swing a 
few more times, barely, missing 
the lamp on his desk. 

"I thought the advertising was 



rather clever, too. They'll feel a 
great obligation to us for sending 
them 'Earth's Fairest Daughters.' 
Be good for strengthening the ties 
to the mother planet." 

MacDonald looked somewhat 
happier. 

"What about the women themselves, though? We sold them a 
bill of goods, too, you know. 
They're expecting modern cities 
and handsome, rugged heroes for 
husbands. I know damn well that 
a lot of the colonies aren't much 
more than sinkholes and I suspect the sanitary, rugged, 
thoughtful male is strictly off the 
artist's drawing board. What 
happens when the women find 
that out?" 

Escher took the ball out of the 
glass and went back a few paces 
for another try. 

"Don't forget, Mac, the girls 
are the ones who weren't wanted 
here, the ones who were heading 
up for lives as old maids. They're 
going to planets where they're 
strictly a scarce item, where 
they'll be appreciated. The colonists will think they're getting 
something special and they'll 
treat the girls that way. They'll 
take good care of them. There 
might be a few difficulties at first, 
but it'll come out all right." 

"In other words, the whole 
thing hinges on how the colonists 
receive the girls. Isn't that it?" 

The ball thunked solidly into 



THE GIRLS FROM IARTH 



the glass again and rolled out. 

"That's Tight. We've hedged 
our bets the best we can. Now 
we'll have to wait and see, But 
I don't think we have anything 
to worry about." 

"Uh-huh," MacDonald grumbled. "It works out nice in theory, 
but I wonder how it'll be in practice.** 

VIII 

pHYLLIS let the deceleration 
■*- press her into the cot and 
tried to relax. In ten minutes they 
would be disembarking in Landing City. Landing City, with its 
wide, paved streets and modern 
buildings, the neatly laid-out 
farms and the modern rocket 
port. 

There was a clanging of bells, 
a sudden feeling of nausea, and 
she knew they had landed. In 
the excited buzz of conversation 
from the others, she got her small 
suitcase and filed toward the 
hatch. 

They took her name and gave 
her the emigration bonus, and 
then she was on the ramp going 
down, smelling the cool fresh air 
and feeling a damp breeze against 
her face. 

She looked down , . , 

The modern rocket port was a 
scorched expanse of dirty ground, 
with a rusting shed at one end 
that she guessed was the office. 



Landing City was a collection of 
rundown shacks and corrugated 
huts with mud streets and wooden sidewalks running between 
them. 

She should have guessed, she 
thought bitterly. She had been 
sold a bill of goods. And there 
was no going back now; she was 
Stuck with it. 

Stuck with it. 

She took another look. At least 
it would be healthy, and there 
was something besides the concrete and granite of a city to look 
at. It wouldn't be day in and day 
out of sitting eight hours behind 
a typewriter, and then back to 
her lonesome two rooms for an 
evening of bridge or a night with 
a boring book. 

And there was nothing wrong 
with the town that couldn't be 
remedied and improved with a 
little work. She and the others 
would see to that. Progress was 
going to hit Landing City 
whether the colonists like it or 
not. , 

The colonists . . . 

She stared at the whiskery, 
ragged lot of men of all shapes 
and sizes that were waiting to 
welcome them. 

They had probably, she 
thought queerly, never heard a 
lecture on art in their lives. And 
they wouldn't have any interest 
in historical novels and it was an 
even-money bet that bridge and 



KM 




 



canasta games would bore them. 

They were uncultured, she 
thought happily, thoroughly uncultured! Their main interest was 
probably in having a home and 
raising a family and working . . , 

And with a shave and clean 
clothes, they might even be handsome ! A dimly remembered 
poster of a blond-haired giant 
flashed into her mind, but she 
dismissed it. The men below had 
a hard, healthy look about them, 
a certain virility, an individuality 
that the pale men back on Earth, 
now that she thought of it, 
seemed to lack. 

She was very definitely going 
to like it here. 

Then she had a sudden, nagging thought. i 

How would the colonists take 
to her and the other bedraggled 
females ? 



IX 

f"pHE twinkling fire came nearer and they could make out 
the outlines of the slim ship. It 
rapidly grew in size and finally 
settled to a heavy, groaning rest 
on the pitted and blackened 
landing field. 

Karl was holding his breath, 
staring at the outline of the hatch 
on the ship's rusty side. It opened 
and tfie flight of descent staira 
slid out. The captain and crew 
came out first. 

Then the women filed down the 
ladder, smiling timidly and looking cold and frightened. 

Karl could hear Hill gulping 
noisily beside him and knew that 
his own mouth was gaping. But 
he couldn't help it.

The Current 
 Novel ... 

ODD JOHN, By Olaf Stapledon 

"Odd John" was the nickname given this strange youth . and odd 
he certainly was. With his incredibly gifted skills and his awesomely 
developed mind, he could have attained power, fame, money — an entire 
nation or even the world! 

But it would have been like a genius ruling an asylum of imbeciles. 
For Odd John was not of the human race; he belonged to the neit 
stage of evolution — Homo Superior! 

Many authors have tried to write the story of Homo Superior and 
failed — just as Pithecanthropus, describing Modem Man, would find it 
an impossible job. But Stapledon succeeded! This is THE masterpiece 
of superman stories, a great science fiction novel!

Tony Radck leaned back in his 
chair and frowned. One-fifteen in 
the morning. At one-fifteen in the 
morning no man, no matter who, 
should be going to his NegEmote. Why not hang a man instead? Or electrocute him? Or 
gas him the way they used to 
back in the old days? In those 
old days his grandfather used to 
Jalk about, where twelve ordinary 
citizens said the word that peeled 
the life off a man like skinning 
an onion. 

He sighed softly and folded his 
hands across a tiny paunch that 
was just beginning to show. Tony 
Radek was getting old. He was a 
*'safe" now. That meant he 
needn't worry about the war any 
longer. He was a nice, mild, 
peaceable gentleman who stayed 
at home and thought beautiful 
thoughts about the younger men 
put in space. A man his age didn't 
feel anger and hate and retribution and lust and treachery any 
more. He was just a little old fat 
guy. He was the Federal Executioner. 

He frowned again and leaned 
forward and touched a nacre button on the desk top. That lit up 
the screen on his left. Not the 
Master Screen, which was the one 
on his right. This was the other, 
the one that could tell him what 
was going on outside the office, 
outside in Portal Waiting, where 
certain peculiar ghouls who de


rived a measure of excitement 
from the executions were allowed 
by the gracious State to hang out. 

He stared at the screen. His 
frown deepened. Portal Waiting 
should be bare and vacant at this 
hour, but it wasn't. This was the 
third night in a row that it wasn't. 
There was a girl out there. A 
quiet girl, a girl who looked about 
as ghoulish as one of the nice red 
ritual roses over in the cooler 
built into the wall. 

Damn the dame, why didn't 
she go home? Tony Radek's upper 
lip lifted a little, showing smalt 
angry teeth. 

At once 'the Emote Neutral 
lights in the office flickered wildly. 
Tony pulled his eyes from the 
screen and glared up at the lights. 
That's progress for you. Let a 
man go on one little momentary 
emotional binge, like this, and 
right away spies in the joint start 
screaming. In a moment now, the 
one on his right — the Master 
Screen — would blink into life and 
old hell-hips himself would start 
poking around asking questions. 
Just see if it didn't. 

He turned his head to the right, 
stared at the Master Screen and 
waited. 

The screen blazed into life. A 
narrow-faced man with washedaway eyes that looked as though 
they'd seen sin and hadn't liked 
it peered angrily over toward 
Tony behind the desk.

"Mr. Radek!" he had a thin, 
thin voice that sounded like a 
sheet of paper slitting down the 
middle. "What's going on down 
there? Can't you control your own 
office? Or maybe you'd like to be 
back in Training?" The eyes 
squinted sharply. 

Tony worked up an innocent 
look. He spread his hands on the 
black surface of the desk, smiled, 
and said mildly: "Out of your 
mind. My lights have been as 
steady as old Emote Neutral herself. Probably that blonde you 
got Central Direction kidded into 
thinking you need as an assistant 
- — probably you sneaked up on 
her when she was in Personal Lok 
and . . ." 

"What?" The Master Screen 
trembled a little and the narrowfaced man's eyes seemed to jerk 
out of registration for a moment. 
"Look here, Radek, I've stood 
just about enough of your insinuations!" 

"Look who's making the lights 
flicker now," said Tony calmly. 
He waved an arm around the 
office. Emote Neutral was flickering rapidly as though controlled 
by an interrupter switch. "Central 
Direction should see this," he observed. 

He stared briefly at the contorted face on the screen. That 
face was working convulsively 
now, getting red like the ritual 
roses over in the cooler. 



He snorted disgustedly, reached 
forward and touched the matswitch which threw the Master 
Screen into visi-lok. At once the 
screen darkened and all sound 
left the office. 

That was more like it. Let old 
hell-hips up in Supplies and Control stew if he wanted, there 
wasn't anything in the Constitution — not even the old Constitution — that said a man had to sit 
and look at him. 

"Centra! Direction to Radek!'* 
a hard voice rapped out of the 
alternate speaker over in the corner. 

Tony Radek jerked, spun 
around. He swallowed quickly, 
said nervously: "Yes, sir?" 

"Radek, you're violating Ordinance Six, Code 325, Division of 
Security! Unlock that visi-screea 
at once!" 

"Yes, sir." Tony's hand flew to 
the matswitch, pulled it. "Sorry. 
Elbow must have hit it acciden* 
tally. Didn't know it was 
locked . . ." 

"Radek. there's a war on. 'That 
visi-lok must be used only in 
emergency. You know that." 

"Yes, sir. Like I said . . 

"I heard. In the future, be a 
little more careful. And, Radek— 

"Yes, sir?" 

"Ready Cell Two. Execution at 
one-twenty-seven. John Edward 
Haley. Convicted of mass interference of morale, City of Greater 



THE FURIOUS ROSE 



101 



Jew Denver, as outlined under 
Congressional Act of April 12, 
2250. Decision rendered equally 
on all three Final Master Machines." 

"No appeal?" asked Tony very 
softly. 

"No appeal. And, Radek — " 
"Yes, sir?" 

"The condemned is married. 
Check with Supplies and Gontrol 
for bill of divorcement. His wife 
is a young woman, will have to 
marry again in the morning as 
outlined under Congressional Act 
-f May 28, 2211. Got that?" 

"Yes, sir." 

The Master Screen went dead. 
■Tony blinked. Bill of divorcement. Will have to marry again 
in the morning as outlined under 
Congressional Act. By God, that's 
progress for you! He sat staring 
at the Master Screen for. a long 
time. 

Then he sighed, punched the 
button on Supplies and Control. 

"Hell-hips!" he growled. "Snap 
it up. Execution at one-twentyseven. Bill of divorcement." 

The narrow face peered sourly 
out at him from the Master 
Screen. It didn't have much emoUon in it now. It was almost 
'lank, like the face of a humanoid 
obot somebody'd left something 
out of. 

"Been hittin' the bottle again, 
huh?" said Tony. 

"My name is Clacker, Mr. Ra


dek. Arthur Jared Clacker. Kindly keep that in mind when you 
address me." 

"Sure, sure. Nice name. Lovely 
name. Sounds like a stone-boat 
going over ground glass. Whip up 
that bill of divorcement." 

"It's ready, Mr. Radek. Been 
ready for the last half hour. I 
suggest that if there were a little 
of my own well known and demonstrated efficiency in your office, 
perhaps Executions would be 
something to be proud of. Instead 
of what it is. Instead of the foulsmelling, sloppily run, lice-infested . . ." 

Tony's hand reached out for 
the button on Supplies and Control. "Watch those lights," he said 
ti redly. 

TIE got up from the desk, 
stretched a little and went 
across the office to the cooler in 
the opposite wall. His feet made 
no noise; he had that quiet tread 
that all cats, a few men and some 
women achieve. His hand interrupted the automatic cellgard and 
a tiny, almost hidden door in the 
wall swung wide. He reached up, 
poked his hand in the cooler, felt 
around. A little smile came into 
his eyes. He took his hand out of 
the cooler, -got up on tiptoes and 
looked inside. No roses. Not even 
one rose. 

Not even half of a rose. 

Chuckling, he went back to the 



>f»6 



6 A I A X Y SCIENCE FICTION 



desk and jabbed a finger at the 
button over Suplies and Control. 

"Hell-hips!" he rapped. 
"Where's all that well known and 
demonstrated efficiency I've had 
to rake out of my ears?" 

The narrow face lit up the Master Screen once more. It looked 
bored now. "Mr. Radek, there 
was something?" 

"Yeah. Something." Tony's 
voice dropped, got deadly soft. 
"How many weeks since you 
checked the cooler, boy? There 
aren't any ritual roses." 

"There — there aren't any?" 
."That's right, Mr. Clacker. 
Now get away from that screen. 
I'm reporting this to Central Direction.'* His finger jammed down 
on the Supplies and Control button. He watched the Master 
Screen go blank and grinned. He 
thought, "Shake a little, Mr. 
Clacker, shake a little," because 
he didn't dare even whisper to 
himself. 

He sat down at the desk again 
and thought of something. His 
finger went out, touched the button on the screen on the left — the 
Porta} Waiting screen. 

She was still there, hunched up 
in one of the chairs like a small 
child somebody had left in an 
interplanet waiting room and then 
gone away and forgotten. Tony 
frowned once more. Damn that 
dame, she was spoiling his nights. 

He got up, crossed the office on 



silent feet, opened the door of 
Executions, went down a bare, silent hall. At the levelators he 
waited a moment for the platform, took it down, got off again 
at Portal Waiting, and crossed to 
the foyer. 

She was there, just as she'd 
been on the screen upstairs, only 
clearer, more vivid, something 
witnessed instead of second hand, 
something with dimension to it. 
She was in a big chair that could 
have accommodated two like her. 
She had her legs tucked under her 
and her brown eyes that looked 
up at Tony's approach weren't 
any larger than two full moons. 

He said, "Are you Mrs. John 
Haley?" 

The girl nodded. "They — 
they've got Johnny . . ." 

"I know." Tony dropped into 
a chair opposite the girl. "It's 
late," he said softly. "You 
shouldn't be here this time of 
night, Mrs. Haley." 

The girl thought about that. 
"You're Mr. Radek. aren't yo«? 
In the Execution Office?" 

"Call me Tony, Mrs. Haley." 

"All right, Tony. Yes, it's late. 
I hadn't noticed, but I suppose 
you're right." 

"You should go home, Mrs. 
Haley." He stopped, then lied a 
little. "They'll let you know. You 
don't have to worry." 

You don't have to worry. 
They're bringing the guy up now. 



THE FURIOUS • OS I

tittle girl, but you don't have to 
worry. Old hell-hips is getting a 
ritual rose now, little girl, but you 
don't have to worry. 

As if he'd deliberately telepathed the thought, the girl said 
suddenly : "Tony, is — is it true 
about the furious roses? I mean, 
if a man is found guilty, do 
they—?*" 

"The "furious* roses, Mrs. 
Haley?" He smiled. "1 see. You 
mean because they're so red. Yes, 
it's true. Ritual roses, we call 
them, hut that's nothing. Nothing 
at all. A custom only. A symbol 
handed down. It means nothing." 

"I krow." The girl nodded 
arv n. "V.'hen we were children, 
we alw-ys called them the furious 
roses becr.usc they were a furious 
red. We always used to say that 
if an innocent man was executed, 
the furious red rose would right 
away turn white, Tony. To show 
they'd been wrong about him." 

He shrugged. "Bedtime stories, 
Mrs. Haley." 

"Not — not that it means anything to me. Tony. They'll find 
Johnny innocent, of course. All 
three machines. The final machines." 

Innocent? Oh, sure. 
"A men, said Tony with a 
\ ;;juc motion of his hands. 
"V.lict'c the dliw .nee v.l.::t man 
woman has? In the morning 
there's always another — and another name. What's the differ


ence?" He smiled a small toy 
smile with eyes half closed so the 
gir! couldn't look too closely into 
them. 

But it was all right, she hadn't 
heard. At least she wasn't balling 
those big eyes of hers at him. She 
was looking down into her folded 
hands. 

He continued, "There's a war 
on, Mrs. Haley. It seems there*! 
always a war on, somehow. And 
everybody — you, me, the guy 
down the street who skins ships 
for a living — we all have to remember that. And yet some of us 
don't. Some of us go off on a 
tangent and try to sell out our 
country and then there's hell to 
pay. And if we're found guilty, we 
get the execution. The NcgEmote." 

The girl's lips began to tremble. 
She looked up. "Does it hurt, 
Tony? I mean ..." 

"Physically? No, of course not.** 
A corner of his mouth curled. 
"We're humane nowadays, hadn't 
you heard? We just strap a man 
in a chair and press a button and 
down comes a metal hood over 
him. We press some more buttons 
and pull a switch or two, and 
that's that. No feeling, nothing. 
The man's as good as new except 
he has no emotions any more. No 
emotions whatever except personal physical pain, such as he'd 
need in case somebody stepped on 
his toe or jabbed him with a pin. 



lot 




 



The State wants us to protect ourselves, you see. It wouldn't want 
us getting hurt because we don't 
feel anything." 

He stopped because it was getting harder to continued. "We 
used to call it 'stripping,' but that 
was long ago before the humane 
boys decided the term was a little 
cruel. Now it's just Neg-Emoting. 
But the same thing. Just a fancy 
title." 

Her big eyes were suddenly eating into his. "What do they do 
with them, Tony?" 

He shrugged again. "Send 'em 
off to Training. Some can be 
taught this, some that, but a living death nevertheless. What else 
can a traitor expect?" 

The girl began to tremble all 
over. "Not Johnny! They can't 
do that to Johnny! He's innocent. 
Tony — he didn't do anything! 
Tony, tell them that! Tell them to 
let him go . . .** 

He put his teeth together hard. 
What do you say to a woman 
who sits across from you, waiting 
the long, long wait? What do you 
say to a woman like this when 
you see the terror — and something 
else — in eyes like hers? 

"You like the guy, Mrs. 
Haley?" he asked gently. "That's 
old-fashioned as hell, you know. 
We all learn that way back in 
primaries." 

But the woman wasn't listening again, wasn't caring what he'd 



said. She began to whisper very 
softly: 

"In the nights I used to be 
frightened. I used to lie there 
asleep and dream of the ships 
coming down and spraying the 
house with the burn-waves. And I 
could hear the roaring thunder of 
the jets and the house would start 
to shake and I'd try to yell, but 
I couldn't. Something inside 
would be choking me. And just 
when the burn-waves would be 
coming hot through the window 
and licking at the walls inside the 
room, I'd scream myself awake 
and jump up in bed and the sweat 
would be pouring off me." 

Tony stared, incredulous, into 
the big balls of fright that her 
eyes had become. 

"And then the lights would 
come on again, and there would 
be Johnny lying next to me smiling a little, and his curly hair 
would be all tousled from sleep, 
and he'd say to me, 'Baby, you've 
been dreaming again. Don't you 
know I'm here? Don't you know 
I'll always be here? Don't you 
know that, Baby?' And then it 
would be all right, and the roaring jets would be only the dawn 
shift going out on Security Patrol. 
And then I could go back to sleep 
again." 

She stopped. Portal Waiting 
had become a gray ghost of a 
thing with nothing living in it, 
only the clouds of memory like 



THE FURIOUS ROSE

smoke veils swirling, drifting here 
and there, soon gone. 

And then: "They'll let him go, 
Tony. He's innocent, you know. 
They have to let him go." 

He didn't look at her. He got 
up from his chair, put his hands 
rigidly at his sides. Then he did 
look, just once, and very hard. 

"Get out of here!" he growled. 

"No, Tony." 

He took a deep breath, turned, 
went across the foyer to the levelators. As he passed under the 
huge Master Screen, her voice 
came again, but quite thin: 

"You'll let me know, Tony? 
You'll let me know as soon as you 
get word?" 

He didn't answer, didn't look 
back, didn't do anything except 
keep going to the levelators. He 
Went upstairs, found the door of 
Executions, opened it, went 
through, let it slam shut. 

THINGS started to happen. 
The Master Clock over on 
the black desk made a quiet blipping sound and the Emote Neutral lights went out. At once the 
office was flooded with Amber 
Official, the working lights. Then 
the Master Screen glowed and a 
narrow-faced man with washed away eyes looked out at him. 

"Condemned is waiting, Afr. 
Radek;" the narrow-faced man 
said acidly. "Cell Two is getting 
dusty waiting for you, Mr. 



Radek. Very dusty.'* 

Tony looked up. His heart 
wasn't in it, but he said it anyhow: "Go chase your blonde some 
more, hell-hips." 

He went over to the desk, 
banged the Supplies and Control 
button, held it down. Master 
Screen darkened. He looked at 
the small square of white paper 
on the black desk top. 

A bill of divorcement. Like 
that. So in the morning the kid 
downstairs could go out and get 
herself another mate and then she 
could go back to bed again and 
dream some more about the roaring jets and the burn-waves. 

He reached up and wiped at his 
forehead. She didn't have to see 
it happen. Nothing in the Constitution — old or new — stated she 
had to see it happen. He looked 
down at the matswitch that controlled the visi-Iok on the Master 
Screen. He clamped his teeth together and his hand went out 
and flipped the switch. The office 
went dead. 

Maybe nobody'd notice. Maybe 
he'd have time to slip into Cell 
Two and get it over with before 
anybody noticed. He started 
across the room on fast, silent 
feet. 

"Radek!" the alternate speaker 
over in the corner blasted out. He 
froze solid. "Radek, don't move! 
Stand where you are!" 

Don't move? He couldn't have 



GALAXY 3CIENCR FICTION 



moved if he'd had jets on. And 
then the hard voice went on 
again : "Central Command to 
Supplies and Control. Use Emergency visi -relay. Unlock the Master Screen! This is Command 419, 
Regulation Four. Signed, Countersigned." 

Almost at once the Master 
Screen flickered into life and a 
hard, severe -looking face appeared there. "Radek, turn 
around! Face the screen!" 

"Yes, sir." Tony turned. 

"Second violation, Radek. 
Why?" 

Tony forced a blank face. He 
lifted his shoulders, said: "I was 
over here on my way to Cell Two 
for the Execution. How could 
I—" 

"That will be all, Radek! Clear 
your desk. Prepare for judgment 
on final machines." 

Tony swallowed. He didn't 
move because he couldn't move. 

"Well, Radek?" 

He fought his face clean, kept 
his hands rigid at his sides. Sweat 
was rolling down his back, but 
that was all right; Central Command couldn't he exprcted to see 
tweat roll down a man's back 
under his clothing, though a lot 
of people thought so. 

"A suggestion, sir," he said at 
last. 

"What?" Hard eyes bored into 
his own. 

He let a little anxious look 



creep over his face. Not a guilty 
look — he hoped — but the kind Of 
anxious look a worried but innocent man might have in a spot 
like this. 

He said quickly: "About that 
visi-lok. I suggest it might have 
gone into lock by itself. You see, 
it's one of the old-fashioned kind, 
the type they used to have that 
worked with solenoids. We've had 
trouble with them before." 

That brought a little silence. 
The hard eyes in the screen said 
at last: "Central Command to 
Supplies and Control. Is the visilok in Executions controlled by a 
solenoid? Was it never changed to 
relay?" 

Tony gulped. He looked into 
the Master Screen, but he remained frozen to the floor, hardly 
breathing. And then a very thin 
voice answered nervously: 

"I — 1 believe that's correct, sir. 
I believe Executions does have 
the old-fashioned solenoid. It 
seems there hasn't been time to 
change it. I've been intending 
to ... ." 

The voice was cut off. The hard 
eyes came back to Tony. "Decision!" the hard voice said. 

"Yes, sir?" 

"Exonerated. Radek! Carry on 
with Execution in Cell Two." The 
screen went blank. 

Tony shuddered. A close one. 
A damned close one. That was the 
war for you. Even a man's breaths

■re counted. He went on shaky 
feet over to the cooler, reached in, 
got out a ritual rose, left the office 
end shuffled down the hall to 
Cell Two. 

John Edward Haley. The condemned. A thin man, Tony 
thought. Well, sure, there aren't 
many fat men any more. Not in 
ordinary circumstances, that is. 

The man was sitting tensely in 
the chair. There was no one else 
in the cell, which was as it should 
be, of course. Witnesses, yes — the 
Master Screen up on the wall — 
but not here, not visible. 

Tony went across the Cell. 
"John Edward Haley," he said. 

The man moved a nervous 
tongue over dry lips. 

"John Edward Haley, you have 
been sentenced for Execution. 
Now hear these final words of the 
State as directed by Presidential 
order from Responsibility Official 
in the City of Greater New Denver, this night." 

He took two small steps toward 
the man in the chair. He held out 
the red rose, put it in the hand 
of the other. Then he stepped 
back two steps until his toes were 
just touching a small plaque built 
into the floor. He looked down, 
read from the plaque: 

"The giving of this rose. A symbol for the red of the blood of 
your brothers that you have let 
by treason and/or treachery. A 
symbol that as the rose is red, so 



are the unclean acts of your own 
hand, of your own mind. The 
State has so spoken." 

He looked up. A nice way to 
kiss a guy off. Might as well tell 
him he bit his brother's finger, 
too, when he was a kid. 

"Have you anything to say?" 
he asked. 

The man's nervous tongue 
worked again. He said quickly: 

"Yeah. Look, guy, just one 
thing. Just one favor. I don't give 
a damn what happens to me. 
Sure, I'm guilty. So you caught 
me, and so I take it. So what? A 
guy expects that. But the wife . . .** 

Tony's teeth came together 
hard. 

"... But the wife, see? She's 
down in Portal Waiting. Been 
there for three nights now. I don't 
want her to witness this. I don't 
want her to look into that .Master 
Screen down there and see it. 
That's all I'm asking, guy, and it 
ain't much. Just a flick of a switch 
is all I'm asking. It ain't much. 
It ain't, is it?" 

It ain't, hey? By God! 

"When the hood comes down, 
she'll see it. She's bound to," the 
thin man went on fast. "She'll see 
the flash in the Screen and she'll 
know it's me, and she's never done 
anything to deserve that. That's 
all I'm asking, guy. That's all 
I'm asking." 

The silence in the cell was a 
thick thing. Tony could feel the 




 



sweat rolling down his back again. 
But a different kind of a sweat 
now — not a sweat for himself, a 
sweat for somebody else. Just one 
finger touch on that visi-lok matswitch would do it. Just one 
finger, and the small woman 
downstairs in Portal Waiting 
wouldn't know, would have one 
more instant of waiting, of hoping 
against hope. Of suspense. Of 
breathing in the air we all breathe 
in, of being alive, sentient; and 
knowing that her man, the thin 
fellow with the tousled, curly hair, 
was still sentient, too. 
"Well, guy?" 

Tony wet his lips. "Sorry, 
Haley. Petitiori refused." The 
hood came down. The Master 
Screen up on the wall blazed into 
life. 

*T*ONY sat at his black desk 
with his hands folded, fingers 
laced. That's Executions for you. 
And this is war. There's a war on. 
Don't forget that. He looked down 
at his hands, sighed. Then he 
reached out and touched the Supplies and Control button. 

"Hell-hips!" he growled. 

He looked at the screen. It 
wasn't hell-hips. It was a blonde. 
Not a young blonde, a scarecrow 
blonde. An old wretched piece of 
living mechanism like himself. 

"Where's Clacker?" he asked. 

"Mr. Clacker is no longer with 
us, Mr. Radek." 



"Huh? What happened to 
him?" 

"Mr. Clacker has been taken 
to the three Final Machines for 
trial and judgment. I am now 
taking over here. My name is 
Hortense. G. Welker Hortense." 

Tony looked at the blonde. 
Crude, undisguised lights were 
coming from the woman's eyes. 
Pro motion -happy. 

He said at last: "Sorry as hell 
about that. The solenoid thing, I 
suppose. I didn't mean to get the 
guy in trouble. I sure didn't mean 
that." 

"He'd been ordered to change 
it. It was no one's fault but his 
own. You were only doing your 
duty, I'm sure. And duty comes 
above everything," 

"Yeah. Yeah. sure. I know. 1 ' He 
sighed once more. "Get me an airbrush and a bottle of white 
paint." 

"What?" 

"I want an airbrush and a bottle of white paint. I want to paint 
my nice little ritual roses. I don't 
like red any more. I want all 
white ones." 

"Mr. Radek. . . ?" 
. Tony glared. "Do I get that 
paint or don't I? Don't just stand 
there!" His fist banged down on 
Supplies and Control button. The 
Master Screen went blank, and 
then flashed into motion again 
fast. The blonde again. Nasty 
now. A chip off the old block.

with skirts. 

"Request not granted! This is

Radek! Specifically, against ordinance 1991, of the Code of M 

*'Oh. can it," he growled wearily. "For God's sake, don't give 
me any more of that." 

The blonde stiffened. "Well?

and Control, I have certain weltdefined and inflexible . . . 

Tony blacked her out. He held 
her blacked out till he was sure 
she wouldn't come on again.

The Master Clock made a quiet 
blipping noise. Amber Official 
lights dimmed and Emote Neutral 
came on. Long, probing shadow 
fingers snaked here and there 
across the floor, and a stillness 
that should have been restful de


scended eventually on the place, 
"Radek!" 

The hard eyes. The hard voice. 
Tony looked into the screen. "Yes, 
sir?" 

"Radek, that woman is still 
downstairs in Port at Waiting* We 
can't have her hanging around all 
night. Why hasn't she been given 
her bill of divorcement and sent 
home? My God, man, where'* 
your feelings? She's at least entitled to that." 

"Right away. sir. I was just 
going," 

He picked up the square of 
white paper. He pushed back his 
chair, got to his feet, went across 
the office taking those peculiar, 
quiet little steps of his. 

Yes, sir. Just going, sir. On my 
way, sir. Because, sir, as you've 
pointed out so clearly, sir, she's 
at least entitled to that.

WORLD OF WONDER, edited 
by Fletcher Pratt. Twayne Pubfishers, New York, 1951. 445 
pages, $3.95 

/"fcF the 19 tales Fletcher Pratt 
has selected for his first anthology of fantasy and science 
fiction, all but four rate B plus or 
better — an excellent score. The 
reason is not hard to find, either, 
since, according to the records 
of that nonpareil Index Master, 
Anthony Boucher, 9 out of the 19 
have previously been anthologized. 

The answer is simple: Mr. 
Pratt and his publishers are not 
specifically interested in the fan 
market. 



It seems they are aiming at the 
collateral reading market in high 
school and college literary and ' 
composition courses. They should 
do well in this market, for the 
book is an exciting job for those 
who have not read the stories 
elsewhere. 

On the other hand, it contains | 
several never - before - reprinted : 
masterpieces, too. Among them ; 
are Isaac Asimov^s "The Red I 
Queen's Race," Fredric Brown's 
"Etaoin Shrdlu," A. Bertram 
Chandler's "Giant Killer," Rob- I 
ert Heinlein's "They," Philip 
MacDonald's "Private — Keep . 
Out," Judith Merril's "That Only 
a Mother," and two by H. Beam 
Piper, "He Walked Around the

Horses*' and "Operation RStfP." 
A distinguished list, though unco 
short 

Previously anthologized items: 
O. Henry's "Roads of Destiny," 
William Tenn's "Child's Play," 
Franz Kafka's "Metamorphosis." 
two of Kipling: "The Finest 
Story in the World" and "The 
Mark of the Beast," Sprague 
de Camp's "The Blue Giraffe" 
end Ray Bradbury's "The Million-Year Picnic." 

The other talcs, which you may 
like better than t, are: James 
Blish's "Mistake Inside," Gouvemeur Morris's "Back There in 
the Grass," Esther Carlson's 
"Museum Piece," and Nelson 
Bond's "Conqueror's Isle." The 
Morris and the Bond have been 
previously anthologized, too. 

Fletcher Pratt's introduction 
presents ideas about science fiction and fantasy in a way that 
makes most of us other anthologists sound like circus barkers. 
Best of all is his open recognition 
of the fact that top science fiction 
and fantasy are essentially intellectual — a medium for the expression of ideas which otherwise 
would be difficult, dreary, dull— 
Or even somehow dangerous. 

THE HOUSE OP MANY 
WORLDS, by Sam Merwin, Jr. 
Doubteday # Co., New York, 
1951. 216 pa£es, $2.75 



SAM Merwin, until recently 
editor of Thrilling Wonder 
Stories and Startling Stories, has 
turned out a rather disappointing 
first science fiction novel. The idea 
is fine, though unoriginal, but one 
feels that the author was in too 
much of a hurry to turn it into 
a polished story. 

77»e House tells ingeniously of 
parallel worlds which touch at 
"tangential points" through which 
a group of people called "The 
Watchers" (vide John D. MacDonald's "Wine of the Dreamers." 
reviewed last month) supervise 
their various development lines. 

The drama here revolves 
around a couple — male photographer, female poet-reporter (and 
a pretty silly character, too)— 
who are unwillingly drafted to 
become Watchers, and who 
"watch" on an odd alternate 
American Continent that has 
kerosene but no gasoline, rockets 
but no internal -combustion motors, invincible heat-ray guns but 
no airplanes, a depressed and 
under -developed North and an 
oligarchically imperial South. 

The job of the Watchers is to 
prevent this southern government, 
with its capital in New Orleans, 
from disposing of a people's hero 
who is trying to bring science and 
technology to fruition. They succeed, of course. And at the very 
end there is a snapper in the tail 
that comes as all the greater a 



116 




 



surprise for the excellently understated way in which it is put 
over. 

If you can overlook the hasty 
writing and unfortunate characterizations, you'll find this an intriguing story. 

THE SEA AROUND US, by 
Rachel L. Carson. Oxford University Press, New York, 1951. 
250 pa^es, $3.50 

'T^HE best science fiction is 
sometimes defined as being 
nothing more than an extropolation of the known. In many — and 
in some of its best — parts, The 
Sea can according to this definition be called science fiction on 
the highest plane. It applies logical and scientific imagination to 
what we know or infer about the 
ocean depths and comes up with 
- — sheer poetry. 

What a book! Though plotless, 
it is rich with characters — dolphons, foraminifera, cephalopods, 
and those strange mammals, the 
whales, who never suffer caisson 
disease no matter how violent 
the change in the pressures 
against their bodies. 

Probably you could call it adventureless, if you wished, yet it 
is crammed with two types of 
adventure — that of the struggles 
of the waters of the sea and of 
the creatures within them for 
continuity, place, primacy; and 



that more immediately fascinating sort undertaken by oceanographers and other marine scientists in search of difficult 
knowledge and sea-buried secrets. 
It is truly an exciting book. 

EVERY BOY'S BOOK OF SCIENCE FICTION, edited by 
Donald A. Woliheim. Frederick 
Fell, Inc., New York, 1951. 254 
pages, $2.75 

IT is difficult to understand why 
-* a book such as this is directed 
to boys. I know of no youngsters 
who would enjoy any of the tea 
(count 'em, TEN) stories in the 
volume, except Ray Bradbury's 
wonderful "King of the Gray 
Spaces," which is the only tale 
published since 1935 in the book. 

The other nine are hoary chestnuts which men of around 45 to 
55 will like — some of them — since 
it will give them a warm feeling 
of nostalgia for their youth, when 
they used to read stories like 
these and think them hot stuff. 

The roster of authors alone 
give us of the older generation 
a clue to the quality of the stories: Ray Cummings, Bob Olsen, 
Daniel Dresser, Sewell Peaslee 
Wright, Edmond Hamilton, Clifford Simak, Jack Williamson, 
Clifton Kruse. and David H. Keller. None of the stories these 
comparative ancients have in the 
book are good; most of them are 



★ * * * * SHIlf 



U7 



hopelessly awful, even those by 

writers such as Williamson and 
Simak, who are doing much better work today. 

The tragedy is that many uninformed parents will give this 
volume to their kids as an introduction to science fiction. The 
Works of Jules Verne and H, G. 
Wells, for all their age, would be 
a better primer. 

ROCKETS, JETS, GUIDED 
MISSILES AND SPACE 
SHIPS, by Jack Covins and 
Fletcher Pratt, Introduction by 
Willy Ley. Random House, New 
York. 1951. 60 pages 8 by 11 
inches, $1.00 

HERE, on the other hand, is 
definitely the best buy for 
boys in the last two or three 
years. It is a beautifully, densely 
illustrated summary, in simple, 
graphic language, of the origins, 
development, current status and 
probable future of the reaction 
principle as a source of flight 
power. 

Every page has at least one, 
and often two or three, superbly 
real pictures by Jack Coggins, 
nearly 25 of them in full color. 
Many of them are semi-technical 
Charts which do a brilliant job of 
showing what rocketry is actually 
about. 

All for $1.00! 

Fletcher Pratt has done a fine 



job of dramatic condensation in 
his text, telling the whole story 
by its high spots from the days of 
the Chinese invention of gunpowder through "What the WellDressed Spaceman Will Weftf" 
and "Meteorites?" (they're no 
hazard to speak of). 

There is not one suspicion of 
"writing down" in the whole 
book, either. Just what one needs 
for one's 9-to-°0-ycar-old acquaintances who want to learn 
the ABCs of rocketry completely 
painlessly. 

BULLARD OF THE SPACE 
PATROL, by Malcolm Jameson. 
Edited by Andre Norton. World 
Publishing Co., Cleveland & New 
York, 1951. 255 pages, $2.50 

NICE to have these seven 
clean-cut and expert .space 
operas by the late Malcolm 
Jameson between hard covers. 
The volume is published frankly 
as a juvenile, which is smart busi ness sense, even though it is to 
be assumed that Astounding Science Fiction did not publish them 
as such originally. 

Plenty of action, but action 
kept within human and possible 
range, all taking place in the 
Solar System. There are no bkms, 
no faster-than-light travel, no 
Alien Intelligences: just men of 
the Space Patrol and their confreres and adversaries. 



13* 




 



Odd and complicated scientific 
devices abound ; there is much 
manly competition between the 
crew of Bullard's Pollux and that 
of her sister ship the Castor; and 
enough — but not too much— of 
the weird and inexplicable take 
place in space and on the planets, 
moons and asteroids that are the 
natural and lawful prowling 
grounds of the Patrol. 

The stories gain their charm 
and durability from the simplicity and directness with which 
they were conceived and written. 
There is no cheap melodrama. 

Whether the average "sophisticated" adult will enjoy them, 
I don't know. I do, but then 
maybe I'm not quite adult yet. 
Certainly all youngsters with an 
ounce of adventurousness in 
their bones will go all-out for 
I lies* swiftly moving and very 
real-seeming tales of tomorrow's 
adventures in space. 

THE BUND SPOT, by Austin 
Hall and Homer Eon Flint. Prime 
Press. Philadelphia, 1951, 293 
pages. $3.50 

r |^HIS is an astonishingly compclling and dramatic story— 
overwritten, it is true, and leaning a little heavily on the side 
of tin pseudo-metaphysical, as so 
much fantasy did in the days 
when this book first was serialized 
{Argosy All -Story, 1921). Never


theless, it is a fascinating and in 
some ways curiously modern 
piece of genuine science fiction. 

It may well be that The Blind 
Spot is the first of all "parallel 
world" stories of modern times — and let the experts correct me if 
they can! 

The ingenious thesis of the 
Hook is that there are two parallel 
worlds, between which communication can be had only through 
the "spot" or locus, which our 
world calls "Blind" and the other 
world calls "The Spot of Life." 
And to each world, the otVr is 
' The Beyond" or "The World 
After Death" or "Heaven," in an 
entirely non-theological sense. 

The complications and implications of this notion, circumstantially worked out in meticulous detail, make for an uncomfortably real story. It is one of 
its major triumphs that the novel 
seems wholly within the realm 
of fact while one is reading it— 
surely the acid tests of good science fantasy. i 

There is no point in even attempting to outline the plot and 
the denouement, since to try to 
retell them would be pract r ally 
to write the book. Enough; to say 
that only the most jaded and unimaginative of readers will be 
able to put this honored classic 
down unfinished. 

It's good.

YOU must understand that 
Palmer loved his -wife as 
much as ever, or he would 
never have thought of his simple 
little scheme at all. It was entirely for her own good, as he had 
told himself a dozen times in the 
past day. And with that he stilled 
whatever qualms of conscience he 
might otherwise have had. He 



didn't think of himself as being 
something of a murderer. 

She was sitting at the artificial 
fireplace, a cheerful relic of ancient days, reading just as peacefully as if she had been back 
home on Mars, instead of on this 
desolate outpost of space. She 
had adjusted quickly to the loneliness and the strangeness of this 




 



life — to the absence of friends, 
the need for conserving air, the 
strange feeling of an artificial 
gravity that varied slightly at the 
whim of impurities in the station 
fuel. To everything, in fact, but 
her husband. 

She seemed to sense his eyes 
on her, for she looked up and 
smiled. "Feeling all right, dear?" 
she asked. 

"Naturally. How about you?" 

"As well as can be expected." 

"Not very good, then." 

She didn't reply, and he 
thought, She hates to admit it, 
but she really envies me. Well, 
111 fix it so that she needn't any 
more. And he stared through the 
thick, transparent metal window 
at the beauty of the stars, their 
light undimmed by dust or atmosphere. 

The stories told about the 
wretchedness of the lighthouse 
keepers who lived on asteroids 
didn't apply at all to this particular bit of cosmic rock. Life here 
had been *•£,. derful, incredibly 
satisfying. At least it had been 
that way for him. And now it 
would be the same way for his 
wife as well. 

He would have denied it hotly 
if you had accused him of finding 
her repulsive. But to certain 
drunks, the sober man or woman 
is an offense, and Palmer was 
much more than a drunk. He was 
a marak addict, and in the eyes of 



the marak fiends, all things and 
all people were wonderful, except 
those who did notVshare their 
taste for the drug. The latter were 
miserable, depraved creatures, 
practically subhuman. 

Of course that was not the way 
most of them put it. Certainly it 
was not the way Palmer did. He 
regarded his wife, he told himself, as an unfortunate individual 
whom he loved very much, one 
whom it was his duty to make 
happy. That her new-found happiness would also hasten her 
death was merely an unfortunate 
coincidence. She was sure to die 
anyway, before long, so why not 
have her live out her last days in 
the peace and contentment that 
only marak could bring? 

Louise herself would have had 
an answer to that, if he had ever 
put the question to her. He was 
careful never to do so. 

She laid the book aside and 
looked up at him again. She said, 
"Jim, darling, do you think yoll 
could get the television set working again?" 

"Not without a mesotron rectifier." 

"Even the radio would be a 
comfort." 

"It wouldn't do any good, anyway. Too much static from both 
Mars and Earth this time ol 
year." 

That was the beauty of the 
marak, he thought. It changed hia 



THE ADDICTS 



mood, and left him calm and in 
full command of his faculties, 
able to handle any problem that 
came up. He himself, of course, 
missed neither the radio nor the 
television, and he never touched 
the fine library of micro-books. 
He didn't need them. 

A shadow flitted by outside the 
thick window, blotting out for a 
moment the blaze of stars. It was 
the shadow of death, as he knew, 
and he was able to smile even at 
that. Even death was wonderful. 
When it finally came, it would 
find him happy. He would not 
shudder away from it, as he saw 
Louise doing now at the sight of 
the ominous shadow. 

He smiled at his wife again, remembering the six years they had 
lived together, tt had been a short 
married life, but — again the word 
suggested itself to him — a wonderful one. There had been only 
one quarrel of importance, in the 
second year, and after that they 
had got along perfectly. And then, 
two years ago, he had begun to 
take marak, and after that he 
couldn't have quarreled with anyone. It was a paragon among 
drugs, and it was one of the mysteries of his existence that anybody should object to his using it. 

Louise had tried to argue with 
him after she had found out, but 
he had turned every exchange of 
views into a peaceful discussion, 
which from his side, at least, was 



brimming over with good humor. 
He had even been good-humored 
when she tried to slip the antidote 
into his food. It was this attitude 
of his that had so often left her 
baffled and enraged, and he had 
a good chuckle out of that. too. 
Imagine a wife getting angry because her husband was too goodnatured. 

But she was never going to get 
angry again. He would see to 
that, Not after tonight. A big 
change was going to take place 
in her life. 

She had picked up another 
book, and for the moment he pitied her. He knew that she wasn't 
interested in any books. She was 
merely restless, looking for something to do with herself, seeking 
some method of killing time before the shadows outside killed it 
for her for good and all. She 
couldn't understand his being so 
peaceful and contented, doing 
nothing at all. 

She threw the second book 
down and snarled— yes, that was 
the word, '"You're such a fool, 
Jim! You sit there, smug and sure 
of yourself, your mind blank, just 
waiting — waiting for them to kill 
you and me. And you seem actually happy when I mention it." 

"I'm happy at anything and 
everything, dear.** 

"At the thought of dying too?" 

"Living or dying — it doesn't 
make any difference. Whatever 



124 



6 A l A X Y SCIENCi FICTION 



happens, I'm incapable of being 
unhappy." 

"If it weren't for the drug, we'd 
both live. You'd think of a way 
to kill them before they killed 
us." 

' There is no way." 

"There must be. You just can*t 
think of it while the drug has you 
in its grip." 

"The drug doesn't have you, 
dear." He asked without sarcasm, 
"Why don't you think of a way?" 

"Because I lack the training 
you have. Because I don't have 
the scientific knowledge, and all 
the equipment scattered around 
means nothing to me. M 

"There's nothing to be done." 

Her fists clenched. "If you 
weren't under the influence of the 
drug — " 

"You know that it doesn't affect the ability to think. Tests 
have shown that." 

"Tests conducted by addicts 
themselves!" 

"The fact that they can conduct the tests should be proof 
enough . that there's nothing 
wrong with their minds." 

"But there r's.'" she shouted. "I 
can see it in you. Oh, I know that 
you can still add and subtract, 
and you can draw lines under two 
words which mean the same 
thing, but that isn't really thinking. Real thinking means the ability to tackle real problems — hard 
problems that you can't handle 



merely with paper and pencil. It 
means having the incentive to use 
your brain for a long time at a 
stretch. And that's what the drug 
has ruined. It has taken away all 
your incentive." 

"I still go about my duties." 

"Not as well as you used to, 
and even at that, only because 
they've become a habit. Just as 
you talk to me. because I've become a habit. If you'd let me 
give you the antidote — " 

He chuckled at the absurdity 
of her suggestion. Once an addict 
had been cured, he could not 
become addicted again. The antidote acted to produce a perma* 
nent immunization against the effects of the drug. It was the 
realization of this fact that made 
addicts fight so hard against any 
attempt to cure them. And she 
thought that she could convince 
him by argument! 

He said, "You talk of not being 
able to think!" 

"I know," she replied hotly. 
"I'm the one who blunders. Fm 
the fool, for arguing with you, 
when I realize that it's impossible 
to convince a marak addict." 

"That's it," he nodded, and 
chuckled again. But that wasn't 
quite it. For he was also chuckling 
at his plan. She had thought him 
unable to tackle a real problem. 
Well, he would tackle one tonight. Then she would simply 
adopt his point of view, and she

would no longer be unhappy. After she had accepted the solution 
he had provided, she would wonder how she could ever have opposed him. 

He fell into one of his dozes and 
hardly noticed her glaring at him. 
When he came out of it at last, 
it was to hear her say, "We have 
to stay alive as long as possible. 
For the sake of the lighthouse." 

"Of course, my dear. I don't 
dispute that at all." 

"And the longer we stay alive, 
the more chance there is that 
some ship will pick us up." 

"Oh, no, there's no chance at 
all," he asserted cheerfully. "You 
know that as well as I do. No use 
deceiving yourself, my love." 

That, he observed to himself, 
was the way of non-addicts. They 
couldn't look facts in the face. 
They had to cling to a blind and 
silly optimism which no facts 
justified. 

He knew that there was no 
hope. He' was able to review the 
facts calmly, judiciously, to see 
the inevitability of their dying — 
and to take pleasure even in that. 

He reviewed them for her now. 
"Let us see, sweetheart, whether 
I've lost my ability to analyze a 
situation. We're here with our 
pretty little lighthouse in the middle of a group of asteroids between Mars and Earth. Ships 
have been wrecked here, and our 
task is to prevent further wrecks. 



The lighthouse sends out a standard high-frequency beam whose 
intensity and phase permit astrogators to estimate their distance 
and direction from us. Ordinarily, 
there's nothing for us to do. But 
on the rare occasions when the 
beam fails — " 

"That will be the end." 

"On those occasions," he continued, unruffled by her interruption, "I am supposed to leave my 
cosy little shelter, so thoughtfully 
equipped with all the comforts of 
Earth or Mars, and make repairs 
as rapidly as possible. Under the 
usual conditions, lighthousekerping is a boring task. In fact, it has 
been known to drive people insane. That's why it's generally assigned to happily married couples 
like us, who are accustomed to 
living quietly, without excitement." 

"And that," she added bitterly, 
"is why even happily married 
couples are usually relieved after 
one year." 

"But, darling," he said, his tone 
cheerful, "you mustn't blame 
anyone. Who would have expected that a maverick meteor 
would come at us and displace us 
from our orbit? And who would 
have expected that the meteor 
would have collided first with the 
outer asteroids, and picked up a 
cargo of — those?" 

He gestured toward the window, where a shadow had mo

mentarily paused. By the light 
that shone through, he could see 
that the creature was relatively 
harmless-looking. It had what 
appeared to be a round, humorous face whose unhumorous intentions would be revealed only 
st the moment of the kill. The 
seeming face was actually featureless, for it was not a face at 
ell. It had neither eyes, nor nose, 
nor mouth. The effect of features 
was given by the odd blend of 
colors. Almost escaping notice because of their unusual position 
and their dull brown hue were 
the stomach fangs, in neat rows 
which could be extended and retracted like those of a snake. 

He noticed that Louise had 
shuddered again, and said, in the 
manner of a man making conversation, "Interesting, aren't they? 
They're rock breathers, you 
know. They need very little oxygen, and they extract that from 
the silicates arid other oxygencontaining compounds t of the 

KM*." 

"Don't talk about them." 

"AH right, if you don't want 
lrie to. But about us — you see, 
my dear, no one expected us to 
be lost. And even if the Lighthouse Service has started to look 
for us, it'll take a long time to 
find us." 

*'We have food, water, air. If 
not for those beasts, we'd last 



until a rescue ship appeared." 

"But even a rescue ship 
wouldn't be able to reach us unless we kept the beam going. So 
far, we've been lucky. It's really 
functioned remarkably well. But 
sooner or later it'll go out of order, and then I'll have to go out 
and fix" it. You agree to that, don't 
you, Louise, dear?" 

She nodded. She said quietly, 
"The beam must be kept in 
order." 

"That's when the creatures will 
get me," he said, almost with satisfaction. "I may kill one or two 
of them, although the way I feel 
toward everything, I hate to kill 
anything at all. But you know, 
sweetheart, that there are more 
than a dozen of them altogether, 
and it's- clumsy shooting in a 
spacesuit at beasts which move 
as swiftly as they do." 

"And if you don't succeed in 
fixing what's wrong, if they get 
you — " She broke down suddenly 
and began to cry. 

He looked at her with compassion and smoothed her hair. And 
yet, under the influence of the 
drug, he enjoyed even her crying. 
It was, as he never tired of repeating to himself and to her. a 
wonderful drug. Under its spell, 
a man — or a woman — could 
really enjoy life. 

Tonight she would begin to enjoy life along with him. 




 



HP HEIR chronometer functioned perfectly, and they still 
regulated their living habits by 
it. using Greenwich Earth time. 
At seven in the evening they sat 
down to a fine meal. Knowing 
that tomorrow they might die, 
Louise had decided that tonight 
they would eat and drink as well 
as they could, and she had selected a Christmas special. She 
had merely to pult a lever, and 
the food had slid into the oven, 
to be cooked at once by an intense beam of high -frequency 
radiation. Jim himself had chosen 
the wine and the brandy — one of 
the peculiarities of the marak 
was that it did not affect the 
actual enjoyment of alcoholic 
drinks in the slightest, and one 
of the sights of the Solar System 
was to see an addict who was also 
drunk. 

But it was a rare sight, for 
the marak itself created such a 
pervading sensation of well-being 
that it often acted as a cure for 
alcoholism. Once an alcoholic 
had experienced its effect, he had 
no need to get drunk to forget 
his troubles. He enjoyed his troubles instead, and drank the alcohol for its own sake, for its 
ability to provide a slightly different sensation, and not for its 
ability to release him from an unhappy world. 

So tonight Palmer drank model ately, taking just enough, as it 

1HE ADDICTS 



seemed to him, to stimulate his 
brain. And he did what he now 
realized he should have done long 
ago. Unobserved, he placed a 
tablet of marak in his own wineglass and one in Louise's. The 
slight bitterness of taste would 
be hardly perceptible. And after 
that Louise would be an addict 
too. 

That was the way the marak 
worked. There was nothing mysterious about the craving. It was 
simply that once you had experienced how delightful it was, 
you wouldn't do without it. 

The tablet he had taken that 
morning was losing its effect, but 
he felt so pleased at what he was 
doing that he didn't mind even 
that. For the next half hour he 
would enjoy himself simply by 
looking at Louise, and thinking 
that now at last they would be 
united again, no longer kept apart 
by her silly ideas about doing 
something to save themselves. 
And then the drug would take 
effect, and they would feel themselves lifted to the stars together, 
never to come down to this substitute for Earth again until the 
beam failed, and they went out 
together to make the repairs, and 
the shadows closed in on them. 

He had made sure that Louise 
had her back to him when he 
dropped the tablet into her glass, 
and he saw that she suspected 
nothing. She drank her wine, he 

129 



noticed, without even commenting on the taste. He felt a sudden 
impulse to kiss her, and, somewhat to her surprise, he did so. 
Then he sat down again and went 
on with the dinner. 
He waited. 

An hour later he knew that he 
had made her happy. She was 
laughing as she hadn't laughed 
for a long time. She laughed at 
the humorous things he said, at 
the flattering way he raised his 
glass to her, even at what she saw 
through the window. Sometimes 
it seemed to him that she was 
laughing at nothing at all. 

He tried to think of how he had 
reacted the first time he had taken 
the drug. He hadn't been quite 
so aggressively cheerful, not quite 
so — hysterical. But then, the drug 
didn't have exactly the same effect on everyone. She wasn't as 
well balanced as he had been. 
The important thing was that 
she was happy. 

Curiously enough, he himself 
wasn't happy at all. 

It took about five seconds for 
the thought to become clear to 
him, five seconds in which he 
passed from dull amazement to 
an enraged and horrified comprehension. He sprang to his feet, 
overturning the table at which 
they still sat. And he saw that 
she wasn't surprised at all. that 
she still stared at him with a 
secret satisfaction. 



"You've cured me!" he cried. 
"You've fed me the antidote!" 

And he began to curse. He remembered the other time she had 
tried it, the time when he had 
been on the alert, and had easily 
detected the strange metallic taste 
of the stuff. He had spat it out, 
and under the influence of the 
drug from which she had hoped 
to save him, he had laughed at 
her. 

Now he was unable to laugh. 
He had been so intent on feeding 
the tablet to her that he had forgotten to guard himself, and he 
had been caught. He was normal 
now — her idea of . being normal 
— and he would never again know 
the wonderful feeling the drug 
gave. He began to realize his situation on this horrible lonely asteroid. He cast a glance at the 
window and at what must be . 
waiting outside, and it was his 
turn to shudder. 

He noticed that she was still 
smiling. 

He said bitterly. "You're the 
addict now arid I'm cured." 

She stopped smiling and said 
quietly. "Jim, listen to me. You're 
wrong, completely wrong. I didn't 
give you the antidote, and you 
didn't give me the drug." 

"I put it in your wine-glass 
myself." 

She shook her head. "That wa,s 
a tablet I substituted for yours. 
It's an anti-virus dose from our 



13C 




 



medicine chest. You took one of 
the same things. That's why you 
feel so depressed. You're not under the influence of the drug any 
more." 

He took a deep breath. "But 
I'm not cured?" 

"No. I knew that I wouldn't 
be able to slip you the antidote. 
The taste is too strong. Later 
you'll be able to start taking the 
drug again. That is, if you want 
to, after experiencing for a time 
what it is to be normal. But not 
now. You have to keep your head 
clear. You have to think of something to save us." 

"But there's nothing to think 
of!" he shouted angrily. "I told 
you that the drug doesn't affect 
the intelligence!" 

"I still don't believe you. If 
you'd only exert yourself, use 
your mind — " 

He said savagely, "I'm not going to bother. Give me those 
marak tablets." 

She backed away from him. "I 
thought you might want them. 
I took no chances. I threw them 
out." 

"Out there?" A horrified and 
incredulous look was on his face. 
"You mean that I'm stuck here 
without them? Louise, you fool, 
there's no help for us! The other 
way. at least, we'd have died 
happy. But now — " 

He stared out the window. The 
shadows were there in full force. 



Not one now, but two, threehe counted half a dozen. It was 
almost as if they knew that the 
end had come. 

They had reason to be happy, 
he thought with despair. And perhaps — he shrank back from the 
thought, but it forced itself into 
his mind — perhaps, now that all 
happiness had gone, and wretchedness had taken its place, he 
might as well end everything. 
There would be no days to spend 
torturing himself in anticipation 
of- a horrible death. 

Louise exclaimed suddenly, 
"Jim, look! They're frolicking!" 

He looked. The beasts certainly 
were gay. One of them leaped 
from the airless surface of the 
asteroid and sailed over its fellow. He had never seen them do 
that before. Usually they clung 
to the rocky surface. Another was 
spinning around oddly, as if it 
had lost its sense of balance. 

Louise said, "They've swallowed the tablets! Over a hundred 
doses — enough to drug every 
beast on the asteroid!" 

For a moment Palmer stared 
at the gamboling alien drug addicts. Then he put on his spacesuit and took his gun, and* 
without the slightest danger to 
himself, went out and shot them 
one by one. He noted, with a 
kind of grim envy, that they 
died happy.

ORD sat in his swivel chair 
and surveyed the Solar 
System. The clarity of vision, unimpeded by the twof hundred-mile curtain of Earth's 
atmosphere, was such that, from 
his position in Pluto's orbit, he 
could see with the naked eye 
every one of the planets except 
Pluto itself, hiding in a cluster 
of bright stars, and Mercury, 
eclipsed at the moment by the 
Sun. 

But, then, Ord knew exactly 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOH 



Illustrated by SIBUY 

where to look. Every day, for 
over two thousand days, he had 
looked out on the Solar System. 
He had seen Mercury scuttle 
round the Sun twenty-five times; 
Venus, more sedately, nine ; Earth 
had made six of the familiar trips 
through space that meant yearsf 
Mars was on its fourth journeys 
but Jupiter wasn't more than 
halfway around yet

when Una said the most serious 
things, which was often, her voice 
laughed. "If you hadn't been able 
to see the planets, you'd have 
been a straitjacket case long ago." 

"Who knows I'm not one now?" 
Ord asked. "You don't, anyway." 

He didn't turn yet. He postponed the moment when he 
would, dragging it out almost 
ecstatically from second to second — like a heavy smoker halting, pausing deliberately in 
anticipation, cigarette in mouth, 
before lighting it. 

"I think," she retorted, the 
laughter in her voice as ever, 
*'that so long as you talk sanely 
about madness, you can't be so 
far gone." 

The moment came. He couldn't 
wait forever. He swung around 
and looked at her with a slow, 
ironical smile. He had known 
more beautiful women, but none, 
perhaps, who knew their limitations as well as she did. 

Una always wore that spotless 
white shirt, open-necked and 
tucked tightly into the waistband 
of her sharply creased bottlegreen slacks. Perhaps it was pessimistic to think the worst of what 
one didn't know, but Ord took it 
for granted that Una's only good 
points of figure were the neat 
waist and upper half and the 
length of leg that her customary 
outfit displayed. 

There was a slight irregularity 



about her forehead which she 
treated adroitly by always having 
a cascade of her beautiful ashblonde hair over one side of her 
face. Her teeth were splendid in 
a subtle half -smile ; she never 
allowed herself more. There was 
just a hint at the top button of 
her chaste, irhpeccable shirt that 
her skin wasn't all of a uniform 
satin smoothness, but suspicion 
was never allowed to grow to certainty. 

"fJOW long now, Colin?" Una 
asked. "I don't watch time 
as you do. Where could they be, 
if they started whenever the beam 
failed?" 

"I haven't worked it out since 
you asked the last time." He 
couldn't still the tremor in his 
voice. "But they could be very 
close." 

There was a hint of regret in 
her nod. 

Ord looked past her at the 
blank wall opposite the observation windows. He wasn't cramped. 

The space station three billion 
six hundred million miles from 
the Sun was designed for one 
man who would always be alone, 
who would spend two years in his 
own company for the somewhat 
fabulous salary of a space station 
officer, and everything had been 
done to make the quarters seem 
roomy and comfortable without 
giving a chilling impression of 



134 




 



emptiness. There was the observatory, the machine room, the 
lounge, the workshop, the bedroom, the bathroom, the storerooms, even a spare room into 
which Una disappeared, though 
it had not been provided for Una 
or anyone like her. 

As Ord looked at the blank 
wall, he was thinking of the activity on Earth, six years before, 
when one of the three Pluto directional radio beams had failed. 
There were plenty of beams left 
to guide ships through space, but 
the sudden failure of Station 
Two's beam must have had some 
effect on almost every interplanetary trip. Five minutes on the 
Moon trip, at certain times; two 
or three days on journtys to Mars 
or Venus, depending on the relative positions of the starting 
point, destination, and the two 
remaining Pluto beams; weeks, 
even months more required for 
the run to some of the asteroids 
and the satellites of the outer 
planets. 

Two spokes of the directional 
wheel remained, but that left a 
great gaping angle of a hundred 
and twenty degrees, served only 
feebly by the beams from ships' 
destinations, with no powerful 
universal beam to reinforce them. 

The situation was not new. 
Some day there would be so 
many -line -of -flight beams in the 
Solar System that ships wouldn't 




have to know the beams they 
were on. They would merely 
point their noses where they 
wanted to go and cast off, like 
so many galleons sailing before 
the wind. But as yet there was 
not enough interplanetary travel 
to make the duplication of beams 
practicable. 

If a beam failed, it failed, and 
more than six years had to pass 
before it could be put in operation again, unless the failure occurred at a convenient time — 
when a ship was well on the way 
to relieve a station officer and 
check the equipment, say. 
Through history, however, failure of anything man-made had 
tended to come almost always at 
the most inconvenient times. 

Ord followed the ship in his 
mind through its six-year journey. A week to prepare. Two days 
to reach the Moon. Three weeks 
for the run to Mars, which would 
have been sixteen days if Station 
Two had been sending out its 
beam. Then trouble. Only the 
little Ganymede beam, in the positions of the planets and their 
satellites at the time, to help the 
repair ship on its way from Mars. 
Almost nine months to Jupiter. 
But at least, by that time, the 
ship would have some velocity to 
help the rockets on the remaining 
three billion two hundred million 
miles . . . and the long, dreary 
search for the silent speck in 



{HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



135 



space that was the space station. 

Eleven months altogether, with 
the beam; over six years without it. 

One thing that helped Ord bear 
the extra five years of solitude he 
had to spend aboard the station, 
thousands of millions of miles 
from the nearest man, was the 
thought of the accumulated pay 
he would collect. The station officers were necessary, and the various space lines had to accept 
responsibility for them. 

He would be set up for life, at 
twenty-nine, when he got back to 
Earth at last. 

UNA shrugged. "Oh, well, it's 
been nice knowing you. And 
I mean that.'' 

"It would be for you, Una. But 
that was because of the others 
before you. I learned a lot." 

"You've just broken rule one," 
she said lightly. "Never talk of 
'the others.' Just be careful you 
don't break rule two." 
"What rule is that?" 
"You should know. You want 
me to break it? Most particularly, 
never talk of any others to come." 

She made a gesture of dismissal, as if she were tearing the 
whole subject out of a notebook, 
crumpling it and throwing it 
•way. 

"Shall we play chess?" she 
asked lightly. "It's a long time 
since we did." 



"All right. But not here. Let's 
go into the lounge." 

He led the way through the 
station as if she didn't know it as 
well as he did. He set up the 
pieces rapidly, through long practice. Una didn't sit down opposite him, but poised on the edge 
of the sofa. She always kept her 
long, graceful line intact. 

They had just made the first 
oblique reference to something 
which had been growing for a 
long time. Undoubtedly Ord was 
growing tired of Una. It was nobody's fault, or his. in so far M 
it was anyone's. There was a hint 
of farewell in the chess game. 
One for the road, so to speak. 

Una played quickly and decisively. One particularly rapid 
move brought the usual complaint from Ord. 

"I wish you'd pay more attention," he protested. "If you win, 
I look silly, taking so much time 
to think things out. And if I win, 
you lose nothing because you obviously weren't trying." 

Una laughed. "It's just ■ 
game," she answered. 

She won the first game. "Luck," 
Ord grunted, without heat. "You 
never saw the danger of that rook 
to bishop's fourth." 

"Perhaps not. But look how 
well I followed it up, so it really 
doesn't matter, does it?" 

They played the inevitable second game, and inevitably, also* 




 



Ord won it. Like all chess players 
who have won a game they knew 
they could win when and how 
tliry wished, he felt relaxed and 
pleased with himself. 
He yawned. 

Una rose. "I can take a hint," 
she said. 

"No, please . . ." 

She smiled at him and disappeared into her room. 

Ord spent a long time looking 
at the blank door. He had been 
warned against solitosis (Latin 
xolitarius, from solus, and the 
Greek -os/s), but for him it wasn't 
so bad. He still knew the truth; 
perhaps that was it. After all this 
time, he was still in no danger of 
really believing what was not so. 
For example . . . 

TIE got up and went through 
to the machine room. Among 
other things, this room presented 
a complete picture of conditions 
throughout the entire station 
from moment to moment. He 
could sit before the dials and 
switches and meters and check on 
everything from the outside temperature to the air pressure in the 
farthest storeroom. 

He could see quite plainly, for 
example, that the temperature in 
Una's room, as of that moment, 
was minus 1 10 degrees Centigrade. A long way above absolute zero, certainly — but a long 
way below comfortable bedroom 



temperature. Moreover, the air 
pressure was only eight pounds. 

In a word, though he had :;een 
Una enter the room, he might 
see her come out of it again. But 
Una wasn't there. The door had 
never been open. 

There was no Una. 

Knowing that fact was a big 
factor. Long ago, he had feared 
a time when he wouldn't know 
such things. He still feared it 
now and then. 

Yet if he pressurized the spare 
room, raised its temperature and 
then walked in, he would see Una 
asleep in the bed. If he touched 
her, she would be real. If he 
slapped her face with his hand, 
his palm would sting, and she 
would awaken, resentful. If he 
stabbed her, she would die, and 
he would have to take the trouble 
of burying her out in space. 

That was all real — to him. 

But he could see and appreciate the facts indicated by the 
dials. Even though he was tired 
of Una, however, he could not 
merely tell her to vanish and she 
would be gone. He had had to 
provide a ship to bring her here, 
and he would have to provide 
another to take her away. 

Solitosis was no new thing; it 
had been discovered soon after 
space flight. Unfortunately, no 
one had so far discovered what 
to do about it, except remove the 
conditions that produced it. Space 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



Is not merely a void; it's emptier 
than that — empty of horizon, sky, 
soft sunlight, ground and greenery and buildings, empty of time 
and continuity of one's history, 
either as an individual or member of the human race. Worst of 
all, it's empty of people. A hermit may deliberately escape civilization, but leave him alone on 
a deserted world and he turns 
psychotic. That, in short, is solitosis. 

■There was a reason for the fact 
that there was a space station officer — he could handte the maintenance of the station — and a reason for the fact that there was 
only one. Two men together were 
not enough to protect each other 
from solitosis. The critical number was about forty. But to leave 
forty men on a space station was 
unevonomic. To leave fewer, yet 
more than one, was dangerous to 
all. for solitosis could be homicidal. 

The natural solution was to 
leave one man, who would naturally become a solitosis victim, 
but generally didn't harm himself and could be restored to complete sanity when he was relieved 
—simply by returning him to 
Earth. 

It was simple. It worked. Of 
Course, station officers had to be 
paid to take two years of insanity. It was rarely completely 
pleasant or completely unpleas


ant. The result took different 
forms H but always there were 
pleasures and pains. 

No station officer was ever in 
a position tb know what he was 
in for before he signed on. for no 
man was allowed to subject himself to solitosis twice. 

But Ord was more interested 
in the problem of Una. He knew, 
of course, that he wouldn't work 
any solution out and do something about it. His particular 
brand of solitosis didn't work 
like that. Certainly, somewhere 
in his mind, a decision was being 
reached. But what that was was 
hidden from him. He had to wait 
and see what happened. But being tired of Una, he knew the 
general lines. 

|>UTTING on his suit. Ord 
™ went outside. Fifty years before, scores of ships had come in 
on the beam from the station, 
which had been held on its course 
by six freighters. Each ship in 
the fleet had dragged or pushed 
a lump of rock that nobody 
wanted, for the station, when 
complete, had to have mass. 
Gradually, a planet was built — a 
very small planet, but enough to 
form a base for the station and 
enable it to follow Pluto in its 
orbit with a minimum expenditure of power. The station on 
Pluto itself was already in operation, and Station Three was be

ing set up concurrently. 

Bouncing gently over the rocks 
of the dark, airless world that was 
only big enough to hold a small 
ship to its surface, Ord paused 
at the tiny cruiser Una had used. 
It was as real as she was, no 
more, no less. He forgot the details of the story that explained 
Una's arrival. It was so completely preposterous that any girl 
should arrive alone at any space 
station, in any kind of ship, that 
he hadn't bothered to think up a 
convincing explanation. Una, like 
the others, just appeared. She 
had had a story which she was 
prepared to tell, but he had cut it 
short. That was most satisfactory 
all around. 

The ship, he saw, was not obviously damaged. He jumped up 
on the hull experimentally. He 
thought that he landed on it and 
stood twelve feet above the surface of the planet. 

He searched hazily for an explanation. Perhaps he had picked 
a spur of rock and made it the 
ship. Perhaps his eyes manufactured twelve feet of height. He 
had never inspected the ship 
closely, and he didn't now; it 
would only demand a lot of tiring mental effort. He wouldn't 
know consciously that he was 
constructing everything he saw, 
but that was what he would be 
doing. 

He bounced back to the sta


tion and into the airless machine 
room to examine the beam equipment once more. There was nothing seriously wrong with it. He 
could repair it in a few hours if 
he had the tools and six hands, 
which was more than most space 1 
station officers could say. 

That was the difficulty about 
a job like Ord's — station officers 
had to be experienced. But how 
could they be experienced when 
they could never have done the 
job before? 

He cast a last glance around 
the machine room and left. 

Ord did think of going back to 1 
Una's ship, finding something 
wrong and repairing it, so that it 
would be possible for her to go. 
But that would be humoring his 
solitosis. He still preferred to be : 
as sane as possible. 

He had involuntarily produced ' 
men as companions once, but it 
hadn't worked. He could never 
become sufficiently interested in 
their physical appearance to 
make them real. He might talk' 
with them and enjoy talking, but 
they were always ghosts and '■ 
looked it. The women had never 
been ghosts. 

In fact, he had been afraid, 
once, that the time would come 1 
when he would actually believe 
in them. And, of course, he had 
often explored the possibility that: 
when someone actually came, he 
would think it was part of an


HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



13* 



other hallucination. But there 
seemed little reason to fear that 
while it was still so easy to prove 
to himself that he was alone at 
the station. 

He took off his suit and washed 
and shaved carefully, having decided, long since, that the normal 
habits of human existence should 
be carefully preserved. He dressed 
neatly, though the station was 
warm and there was no real need 
for clothes, and, when he slept, 
he wore pajamas. 

There had been a time — the 
time of Suzy and Margo — when 
the apparent life at the station 
was what might have been expected of a solitary man. But he 
discovered, quite plainly and simply, that there were too many 
complications. Una had perhaps 
been too much of a swing in the 
other direction. His relations with 
her, Ord thought wryly, wouldn't 
have been out of place in a Victorian book for boys and girls, 
except that he didn't mind her 
smoking. 

TTE slept for twelve hours. Qnce 
he wakened, half convinced 
he had heard something, but he 
was sleepy, didn't want to move, 
and had no intention of pandering 
to his own neurosis. 

It was not until he had been 
up for hours that he began to 
wonder why Una didn't appear. 
Perhaps she was ill. Perhaps, 



though he didn't think of it that 
way, he had decided unconsciously to have her die on him, linger* 
ingly and effectively. 

He sighed, went to the machine 
room and brought the temperature and air pressure of Una's 
room to normal. Then he went in. 

She was gone, but her perfume 
lingered in the air.. He went to 
the observation room and looked 
for her ship. It was gone, too. 

He was a little disgusted, but 
he didn't blame himself. It was 
easier and more satisfactory ta 
blame Una. She might at least 
have said good-by. All in all, he 
had liked her. He would have 
liked to meet the real Una, if 
there was one somewhere. He had 
tired of her chiefly because she 
had never become a genuine, 
credible character. She had always been true to type, whereas 
real people weren't. 

He stayed in the observatory 
and looked for a ship. He smiled 
at the thought that what he believed to be a ship, bringing another girl with another fantastic 
story of being lost in space, might 
turn out to be the relief ship. 

He was glad his solitosis had 
not taken the form that Benson's 
had. Benson had lost all sense of 
time. He had spent millions of 
subjective years waiting for the 
relief ship, though Benson only 
had to wait the regulation two 
years, Benson hadn't minded 



HO 




 



much. He thought he had turned 
into a mental giant. As it turned 
out, his functioning IQ had really 
gone up some fifteen points. It 
came down again eleven points, 
but certainly Benson had no reason to regret his two years of 
solitude. Nevertheless, Ord was 
glad it hadn't taken him the same 
way. 

As he expected, the ship was 
there, curving in for a landing. It 
wasn't the relief ship, since it was 
too small. It was, in fact, far too 
small to be capable of the trip 
from Earth with no beam to assist it. 

Ord was on the merry-go-round 
again. If he hadn't done a good 
job on the last hours of Una, he 
had made up for it with the first 
few hours of whoever it was. The 
little ship overshot, handled exactly as women often handled 
spacecraft. It took a long, fivehour sweep that had Ord biting 
his nails. Moreover, it wasn't a 
rocket ship at all. Perhaps this 
time the girl — naturally, it would 
be a girl — had an explanation for 
the impossible to beat all explanations. She was certainly keeping him in suspense. 

But at last the ship was down, 
and Ord, already in his spacesuit, 
hurried out to it. A figure emerged 
as he reached it, and through the 
faceplate he saw a face which was 
clear from the start. 

The girl gestured toward the 



ship, uselessly. He indicated the 
space station. She shook her head 
inside the huge helmet, pointing 
to the ship. He was puzzled. This 
was new. 

Suddenly, to indicate her 
meaning, she bent down and lifted 
the end of the ship, then looked 
up at him. He understood at last. 
She was afraid it wasn't safe to 
leave the ship there. She thought 
it might blow away. 

He laughed and tried to reassure her without words. It was 
true enough that even a light 
breeze might be enough to break 
the feeble attraction of the planet 
for the ship. But on a tiny manmade world, with no atmosphere, 
that was no problem. He demonstrated, getting below the ship 
and heaving. It sailed up slowly, 
and for a moment Ord almost 
shared the girl's fear that it would 
never return. But then gravity 
caught it and the ship returned 
gently. It was clear that it would 
take considerable force to break 
the hold of the small world on it. 

The girl turned from it, ready 
to go with Ord to the space station. 

^~VRD shut the airlock and began to divest himself of his 
suit. The girl, however, still wasn't 
satisfied. She looked about for 
meters to assure herself that the 
pressure was sufficient. Gravely, 
Ord pointed them out. Then she 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 




opened her helmet and took a 
slow, cautious breath. 

"You must be Baker," she said. 

That was another shock. Baker 
was the previous station officer, 
and Ord had all but forgotten his 
name — actually, until she mentioned it, the name had been forgotten. For a moment. Ord wondered wildly if the girl was one of 
Baker's dreams, seven years late. 
But Baker's solitosis hadn't taken 
that form. 

"No, Ord," he said. "Colin 
Ord. rt 

"Before we go any further." 
she said, "just how does solitosis 
affect you?" 

142 



This, too, was new. 
"Just makes me see things that 
aren't there," replied Ord cautiously. 

"And you know there's nothing 
there?" 

"Sometimes." 
"Do you know I'm here?" 
Ord grinned. "I'm not even 
wondering about it." 

Suddenly the girl was holding 
a gun pointed at him. 

"One thing you can be sure of," 
she told him. "This gun is here.

but I think we should remove 
misunderstandings. I'm not God's

"Very. I told you my name. 
What's yourr?" 

"Elsa Catterline. You want to 
know why I'm here, of course." 

"Not particularly." 

She looked up warily at that. 
But she went on lifting off her 
helmet and removing her spacesuit. Ord made no move to help

her. There was always the possibility that it might really be dangerous. 

"I'll tell you all the same," she 
continued. "I killed a man— why 
and how doesn't matter. I had 
access to an experimental ship. 
That one out there. I thought if 
I disappeared for about two 
years ..." 

"Don't labor over it." said Ord. 
"I'm not asking questions." 
"I know. I wonder why." 
She won her battle with the 
suit and emerged. Ord's eyes widened. She was beautiful, really 
beautiful, but he had expected 
that. The unexpected thing was 
that she wore the kind of outfit 
girls in magazine stories wore in 
similar circumstances — white nylon shorts and what might have 
been called the minimum bra. 

Once there would have been 
nothing surprising in that, but 
for years he had been very careful and restrained. He had tried 
sex undiluted, and then had gone 
back to diluting it in self-protection. It was a long time since any 
of his girls had been so feminine 
and made it so obvious. 

In fact, for the first time, he 
seriously considered the possibility that she was real. Real people 
were sometimes more fantastic 
than the wildest imaginings. 
"I wonder," he said. 
"Don't," she snapped.

"That was for the time when I 
still wasn't sure you weren't violent. I think I can get on with 
you. Ord." 

He nodded coldly. The pattern 
was clear now. 

"I get it," he said. 

The trouble was that it did 
nothing to settle the question of 
whether she was real or not. That 
she could be merely Una's successor was so obvious that there 
was no need to go into it. But it 
was also possible — unlikely, yet 
possible — that a girl of the type 
she seemed to be could have 
picked a space station as a hideout and could have acted as she 
had acted, was acting, and would 
act. 

He was suddenly tired of the 
whole business. He wanted Earth. 
It had been a dull throb all this 
time, but now it flared to a mad 
longing, as it did every few 
months. Ft was all very well for 
Wordsworth to talk about that 
inward eye which is the bliss of 
solitude. Get Wordsworth out 
there and let him run a space 
Station. 

Ord wanted the presence of 
people about him that would keep 
i him sane. He wanted to put women back in their place in his 
i life. He wanted to be able to 
forget for hours, even days at a 
time, that there were such things 
as w-«»nen. 

Only twenty-four hours before. 



he had been congratulating himself that sol itosis hadn't really 
got him. And now he didn't know 
whether Elsa was real or not. 
Either way. it was as bad. If she 
was real, he should have known 
it at once. If she was just another 
ghost, he should have known that, 
too. 

"I'm going out to have a look 
at your ship," he said. 

He thought she would object, 
but she merely shrugged. 

"You might have left your suit 
on, then," she told him. 

Twenty minutes later he was 
inside the little ship. He made no 
examination. That could come after he had settled something else. 
There was light and there was 
air. Fourteen pounds per square 
inch, the meters said. 

He found a gasoline lighter and 
manipulated it clumsily with his 
big, semi-rigid gloves. The flame 
flared. But that meant nothing. 
If there was no lighter, and he 
saw it, he might also see it burn 
where there was no air. 

There was a valve on his suit 
to test air pressure. He opened it. 
The little dial swung around to 
fourteen pounds. The question 
was, had he really opened th« 
valve? He tried again, concentrating, making sure he really had 
hold of the valve. A half-turn was 
all that was necessary. Slowly, 
painfully, he turned it. He saw it 
turn. There was still cigarette

smoke in the small, cramped 
quarters. He watched it swirl into 
the little box at his hip. The needle registered fourteen pounds. 

He felt the sweat on his forehead. Trying to deceive himself, 
to get a jump ahead of his own 
mind, he lunged out into the open 
and twisted the valve again. He 
told himself he was only testing 
it. He looked down. 

No pressure. 

He raised his heavy arms and 
stumbled like a sleepwalker back 
to the ship's airlock. Still keeping 
his arms raised, he entered the 
control room again. Only then did 
he look down. 

The dial, untouched, still read 
no pressure. There was no air on 
the ship. There was no ship. Now 
that he knew that, he was able to 
open and close the valve. 

Elsa was no more real than 
Una. 

IT was easier, then, to check and 
doublecheck. Very soon he was 
walking through the walls of the 
ship she had come in. It was simpler to check on it than on Elsa. 
She would remain real to the 
last, but the ship was only a 
minor part of the illusion. 

He had had some bad moments 
in the last hour. It had become 
all too clear that he was losing 
his last defenses in his fight for 
sanity in insanity. He had won 
his battle again, but perhaps this 



was the last time he would win 
it. The next time he might fail 
to prove the illusion. That, after this, wouldn't necessarily 
prove the reality. 

Elsa was finished. She had 
been too real and not real enough. 
Why had he ever let Una go? 

He plodded back to the station and removed his suit. Ht 
found Elsa in the lounge, squatting on her heels and looking like 
a magazine cover. 

"Out," he said bluntly. "It was 
a mistake your coming here. I'm 
sorry." 

There was a flash of movement 
as she dived for the gun. Just in 
time he tensed himself, reminding 
himself of what he had learned, 
and when she fired at him he felt 
nothing. 

He grinned back at her. 

"The instinct of self-preservation is too strong," he said. "I 
can't let myself be shot, whatever 
happens." 

He stepped forward. She fought 
him for the gun. She bit his wrist, 
and it hurt. But he got the gun. 

"If you shoot me, nothing happens," he pointed out. "But if I 
shoot you, you die. You know 
that?" 

She nodded sullenly and got 
up, put on her suit and left. 

In twenty minutes, her ship 
took off. Ord didn't even watch 
it out of sight. 

He still held the gun in his

hand. He threw it in a drawer. It 
would remain there until he forgot it. Then there would be no 
gun. 

From now on, he decided, there 
would be no surrender to solitosis. There would be no more 
Elsas or Su2ys or Margos. When 
he weakened, he would bring Una 
back, or he might have another 
try at male companionship. 

FOR days, he thought he was 
winning his battle. He slt.pt 
well, and he remained alone. He 
spent a lot of time in the observation room, but he never saw a 
ship. 

The trouble was that the fight 
was not on the conscious level of 
his mind. There would be no 
warning before he would suddenly see a ship, without having 
taken any conscious decision. 
Then it would be too late to tell 
himself there was no ship. 

It came at last. There was a 
tiny point of light moving visibly. 
As soon as he saw it, he left* the 
observation room and fought 
with himself. He might convince 
the other part of his mind that 
it was a mistake, and when he 
went back to the observation 
room it would be a mistake — the 
moving point of light would be 
gone. It had happened before. 

But solitosis was progressive, 
he thought dully, as he stood in 
the observation room four hours 



later and saw the ship. If it didn't 
get you under in one year, it did 
it in two. Or four or six. Una, intelligent and restrained, had been 
the last stand of a mind under 
constant fire. Una was part of 
the disease, yes, but a disease 
still controlled firmly and confidently. When he let Una go, he 
had been giving up. 

The ship this time was a lifeboat from a larger vessel. That 
wasn't new. Suzy had come in a 
lifeboat. So had Dorothy, later, 
from the same mythical ship. 

Ord stood and watched it land, 
concentrating so that his hair 
tingled with sweat. He wasn't trying to exorcize the ship; that 
would have been impossible. He 
was merely building into himself 
a powerful, binding resolve to 
know on this and all future occasions the truth from the lie. He 
would not drive the new visitor 
away as he had driven Elsa when 
he discovered she was another 
phantom. But he must know. Until Elsa came, he had always 
known. He mustn't lose that, 
whatever else he lost. 

He saw a spacesuited figure 
emerge from the lifeboat, and 
then he went down to the airlock 

and waited. 

He must be a hopeless romantic, he thought while he waitedSolitosis showed people a lot

realism, as opposed to romance, 
but he had never takes it. 

The airlock opened. For a moment the face behind the plate of 
the helmet was shadowy and illdefined. Then it cleared gradually, like a lantern slide carefully 
focused, sharp and clear, on a 
screen. 

Ord sighed in relief. He hadn't 
proved yet that the new girl was 
another wraith, but it was going 
to be possible, after all. With 
Elsa's face as clear from the first 
second as his own in a mirror, 
how could he know? 

rpHE girl opened her face-plate. 
* "Colin Ord?" she said briskly, "I'm Dr. Lynn of Four Star 
Lines. Marilyn Lynn." She grinned, a friendly, put-you-at-yourease grin. A professional grin — 
part of the bedside manner of a 
good doctor, male or female, 
young or old. "Cacophanous," she 
added, "but I've had quite a 
while to get used to it." 

"Very nice," he said. "First remark of second castaway on desert island. Do you tell roe the 
rest of the story straight away, 
©r are you going to be coy?" 

She frowned — putting the fresh 
patient in his place. 

"I'm not going to tell you anything," she said, "until I've found 
out a little more about you." 

"Excellent!" Ord answered. 
"Tone, inflection and diction just 



right. It all fits.** 

He saw with further relief that 
she was of the Una type. She was 
beautiful, naturally, but not fantastic. And as she stripped off 
her suit, he saw that she wore 
slacks and a tunic, which was 
reasonable. She looked intelligent. 
She wasn't too young — at least 
his own age. Perhaps he was still 
the master. 

She looked at him, too, with 
the eye of a diagnostician. 

"Don't bother," he told her. "I 
see things that aren't there. Particularly people." 

She nodded. "I see. So you 
don't believe I'm here?" 

"Well, I ask you," he said 
skeptically. "Would you, if you 
were me?" He remembered a line 
of nonsense verse — Lear, probably 
— and quoted, "What would you 
do if you were me to prove that 
you were you?" 

She was weighing the situation 
calmly. She didn't seem to mind 
Ord seeing what she was doing. 

"Do you know I'm not real?*' 
she asked. 

"No. That comes with time. At 
least, it always has so far." 

"You mean you've always 
proved to yourself that your — 
visitors were mere fantasy?" 

"With a struggle." he admitted. 

"Interesting. That looks like a 
case of controlled solitosis. I 
never heard of one before." 

Ord laughed cynically. "That's

right, feed my ego. It always 
comes to that in the end." 

The girl gestured at her discarded suit. "You can't tell 
whether that's real or not?" 

"Not at once. Eventually, yes 
—I hope." 

He led her to the lounge. She 
looked around and nodded. She 
seemed pleased. 

"Everything neat and tidy. You 
have no idea what a pleasure it is 
to meet you, Mr. Ord." 

"That doesn't make you real," 
replied Ord rudely. "They all say 
that." 

She looked at him in surprise. 
"Why should I want to make you 
accept me as real?" she asked. 

It was like a physical* blow. 
Ord had no idea why, but that 
didn't lessen the effect. 

"That's right," he said slowly. 
*'Why should you?" 

"Tell me about the others," she 
suggested. 

Like any good doctor, she gave 
the impression that what motivated her questions was not clinical but personal interest. The 
practicing doctor, Ord mused, was 
primarily an artist, not a scientist. 

He told her. He edited the story 
a little, but he told it fairly, with 
particular detail on Elsa and Una, 
his most recent companions. 

"Una is interesting," Marilyn 
said. "She was the only one who 
knew everything that you do. She 



didn't let you talk about it, but 
she knew." 

A UTOMATICALLY, Ord be^»-gan to make coffee. Marilyn 
watched him. 

"When will you know whether 
I'm real or not?" she asked casually. 

"Can't say. Perhaps in five 
minutes, perhaps not for hours. 
I—" 

"Don't tell me how you do 
it," she said quickly. "Not yet. 
Do it first. Does it involve me? 
I mean, you don't shoot me to see 
if I die, or anything, do you?" 

He grinned. "Nothing like that. 
If I shot you, you would die — 
like the witches in history. They , 
died if they were, and they died 
if they weren't." 

"Your mind has remained agile 
enough." 

"Naturally. I never heard of 
solitosis inhibiting intelligence. 
Did you?" 

She was significantly silent. 

He raised his eyebrows. "You 
mean it often happens? Or always?" 

"Not always. Frequently. It's 
pretty obvious, isn't it? The mind 
unbalanced naturally functions 
less well than the normal mind." 

"Benson was the exception that 
proves the rule?" 

She nodded. She knew who 
Benson was. That, like almost 
everything else, proved nothing. 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



She held up her cup before her. 
"Is this part of the test?" she 
risked. "Whether more coffee is 
actually drunk than you drink 
yourself?" 

"No. that doesn't help. It would 
")C very easy for me to make half 
-vhat I thought I made, to bring 
out one cup and think I brought 

wo, to take a nonexistent cup 
■rom a nonexistent girl, like this."

His words died, for he had seen 
- omething strange in her face. 
" 'orror or sadness or "understand he couldn't be sure. 

"V" • t's the matter?" he asked. 

"I don't know. Perhaps I misunderstood." 

"Something I said?" he continued. "Easy to make half what I 
thought I made . . . you knew 
about that, surely. And bringing 
out one cup when I thought I 
brought two. Nonexistent cup, 
nonexistent girl — it can't be because I called you a nonexistent 
girl, for we've been into that before. Naturally, if there's no cup 
I'd be careful, with part of my 
mind, not to pour coffee in it . . ." 

He frowned. "There it is again. 
" 'ou trk t! not to show it this time. 

t I caught a faint shadow of 
"' f ; ^t'iing 1 s-.'d or d'd fright• ■: you, or makes you unhappy, 
nr maybe just interests you. I'm 
not handing you imaginary cof


fee, I am? It seems real." 

She was completely in control of 
herself again. She laughed. "No, 
not that. You're handing me real 
coffee, which means that part of 
your mind already knows I'm 
real. But it's the part you don't 
trust and can't touch." 

"I'm not doing something I 
don't know I'm doing, am I?" 

She shook her head. "Since 
you're bound to think about it, 
whatever I say — it was just something you said. What you know 
you said. And it's not horrible or 
frightening and there's no earthly 
reason why it should make me 
sad. It's just something I didn't 
know." 

"You won't tell me any more 
than that?" 

She answered the question with 
another. "Don't your puppets do 
what you tell themr r ' 

"No. You know that," 

She put down the cup. "I'll 
wash the dishes," she said lightly. 
"Will that prove anything?" 

"Sometimes, for an intelligent 
girl, you're very dumb," he said 
gloomily. "Next time they were 
used, I could just imagine they 
were washed, couldn't I?" 

"Of course." Her eyes — brown 
eyes, deep-set under thin eyebrows — followed him as he rose 
suddenly. "Where are you going?" 

"To find out if you're real." 
"My ship. Go ahead."

/"VRD went to the airlock and 

put on his spacesuit. He 
thought for a while about what 
he might have said that brought 
that curious expression to Marilyn's face. But it was very clear 
that he could never, unaided, 
work out the problem. What he 
had said was so simple, so obviously true . . . and eventually she 
would tell him about it. It didn't 
matter. 

There was nothing in what had 
happened so far, or what* she had 
said, that settled the problem of 
the moment. Possibly, to add to 
all the other arguments against 
the possibility of Marilyn being a 
real woman, there was the consideration that, if she were, she 
would insist on it. But, after all, 
would she? She was a doctor, 
perhaps a psychiatrist. She knew 
solitosis. 

A doctor of any kind, he told 
himself decidedly, encountering 
anyone with solitosis, would most 
certainly play along with him, 
telling him nothing, denying 
nothing, insisting on nothing. 

That, he realized vaguely, was 
of vital importance. He was not 
at all sure why. 

The test which had worked on 
Elsa's ship was as good as any. 
he thought- It might not work 
twice, but he would do his best 
to see that it did. 

He opened the valve on his suit, 
making quite certain it registered 



atmosphere nil. Then he grasped 
his gloves together and strained 
his arms to pull them apart. 
When he opened the lifeboat's 
airlock, he kept his hands linked 
by his thumbs. In a few moments 
he stood in the control room of 
the little ship, which was the only 
room there, and his hands were 
still linked. 

The needle registered fifteen 
pounds. A dull feeling of failure 
numbed him. 

He had concentrated with all 
his power, making sure the valve 
was really open and that he never 
had a chance to close it. He tried 
again, opening and closing it. 

He might have known that 
each new scheme only worked 
once. He thought, trying to be 
calm. 

Solitosis wasn't a suicidal psychosis, or at least he had heard 
it Was never. He had seen it in 
books. One small indication of 
that had been when Elsa shot 
him and he felt nothing, though 
she had looked perfectly real. 
He could be hurt, as when she 
bit him, but not seriously. 

He battered his fist against the 
bulkhead. There was no straight 
spur of rock that height where 
the ship had landed. A bulkhead 
was there, or there was nothing. 

His glove was made to resist a 
vacuum, but it wasn't cushioned 
against impact. His hand hurt 
and went on hurting. 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



155 



Grimly, he continued beating 
the bulkhead until he could not 
force himself to bear any more 
pain. , 

There was a bulkhead there. 
Therefore, there was a ship. His 
undamaged hand went to his 
faceplate. He hesitated, then reminded himself that solitosis 
wasn't suicidal. He opened the 
plate. He felt his nose, his eyes, 
his chin. He pinched his cheek. 

The faceplate was open and 
he could breathe. 

Only two possibilities were left. 
Either Marilyn and all that went 
with her were real, or he was over 
the top at last, absolutely in the 
grip of solitosis, so that he 
couldn't even be certain he had 
left the space station. 

And if Marilyn was real . . . 

He collapsed weakly as an insidious thought beat the spirit 



156 



G 




out of him. He was ready to believe in Marilyn, but there was 
one thing he could not ignore. 
Solitosis got everyone. People 
could fight it, but they could 
never hold it off. Yet it had very 
clearly not affected Marilyn. You 
knew solitosis when you saw it. 
Even he would know. 

He could not say whether sheexisted subjectively or objectively — could he say whether the 
station existed, whether Earth existed, whether there was a Galaxy? Was there any essential difference between Una and his 
mother or his sister? Were they 
all creatures of his mind? 

Life itself might be a thought 
in his mind. Matter could be 
merely a concept. We existed. 
"/ think, therefore I am." He 
could accept that. Could he accept anything else? 



He forced himself fiercely back 
to normalcy, limiting himself to 
Marilyn. She existed, and because 
she came in a ship in which he 
could open his faceplate, she existed more than Una had. 

Hanging determinedly onto 
that idea, he closed the plate and 
stumbled back to the station. It 
seemed very far away. He had 
taken too much out of himself. 
Mental effort could be even more 
exhausting than physical exertion. Whatever the truth might 
be, he had fought too hard toward it or away from it. 

He got through the airlock into 
the station and, safely inside, fell 
on his face. 

rpWENTY-FOUR hours later, 
he knew that nc had proved 
Marilyn's existence beyond reasonable doubt. He had been ill, 
and she had tended him. 

"You proved what you wanted 
to prove," she told him, when the 
worst was over. "But was it 
worth it?" 

"It was worth it," he said, sitting up in bed. "No wonder whole 
philosophies have been founded 
on reality. It's the most important thing there is to a man." 

She shook her head, smiling. 

"Merely to you." she said. "Solitosis naturally affects what matters most to the individual. But 
we needn't talk about that." 

There was a warmth, a kind


HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



ness about her that none of the 
phantoms could ever have had, 
because they were all reflections 
of himself. He had made them 
what they were. 

"How did you avoid solitosis?" 
he asked. 

She smiled again. "The only 
way. There are fifty men and 
women in the Lioness, the relief 
ship. That number is well above 
the critical point. It will still be 
e while before they can land a 
big ship on this little world, but 
ell the time while they're maneuvering, they'll be keeping me sane 
by being there. I know they are, 
you see. When you do, you'll improve." 

Ord relaxed. Long, involved explanations were never satisfying. 
It was the simple explanation that 
one could instantly believe. 

"That will take a while," he 
said. "I don't mind how long it 
takes." 

He saw the same shadow pass 
across her face. 

"Tell me," he said quietly. 
"Look at me." 

He looked. She was strong, quietly beautiful. She still wore her 
tunic and slacks. He even saw, 
with faint regret, that, while she 
wore no wedding ring, there was 
h white band on her finger where 
one would have been. 

"Yes?" he urged. 

"I didn't realize until you 
talked of a nonexistent girl," 



Marilyn said quietly. "I was real, 
yes, but not your picture of me.** 

"No, it's not so terrible." Marilyn went on. "Almost everything 
was as you thought. It's natural 
to send a doctor first to visit any 
sick person. I'm a doctor, and I 
was a girl once. But that was 
forty years ago. And you had to 
make me young and beautiful." 

With an effort, Ord laughed 
naturally. "Was that all? You 
had me thinking — " 

The old doctor didn't hear him. 
She wasn't thinking of her courage in coming to him alone, but 
remembered that all doctors take 
risks. 

"It was pleasant to be a girl 
again," she said reflectively. "I 
could see myself in your eyes, 
and — almost — I was young again. 
I like you. If it hadn't been too 
completely ridiculous, I'd have 
fallen in love with you." 

"As I grow old in the next few 
weeks, Ord," she told him, "you'll 
be recovering. It will show you 
how your case is progressing. 
When you see me as I really am, 
you'll be all right." 

He put his hand gently on her 
arm. He was thinking of her courage in coming on ahead of the relief ship, alone, because she might 
be able to help a man who could 
not be quite sane. 

"I think," he said, "I see you 
now as you really are."
