HALLUCINATION ORBIT by JT McIntosh

ORD sat in his swivel chair 
and surveyed the Solar 
System. The clarity of vision, unimpeded by the twof hundred-mile curtain of Earth's 
atmosphere, was such that, from 
his position in Pluto's orbit, he 
could see with the naked eye 
every one of the planets except 
Pluto itself, hiding in a cluster 
of bright stars, and Mercury, 
eclipsed at the moment by the 
Sun. 

But, then, Ord knew exactly 
where to look. Every day, for 
over two thousand days, he had 
looked out on the Solar System. 
He had seen Mercury scuttle 
round the Sun twenty-five times; 
Venus, more sedately, nine ; Earth 
had made six of the familiar trips 
through space that meant yearsf 
Mars was on its fourth journeys 
but Jupiter wasn't more than 
halfway around yet 

"It helps, I suppose, to be able 
to see them," said a light, whimsical voice behind htm. Eve* 
when Una said the most serious 
things, which was often, her voice 
laughed. "If you hadn't been able 
to see the planets, you'd have 
been a straitjacket case long ago." 

"Who knows I'm not one now?" 
Ord asked. "You don't, anyway." 

He didn't turn yet. He postponed the moment when he 
would, dragging it out almost 
ecstatically from second to second — like a heavy smoker halting, pausing deliberately in 
anticipation, cigarette in mouth, 
before lighting it. 

"I think," she retorted, the 
laughter in her voice as ever, 
*'that so long as you talk sanely 
about madness, you can't be so 
far gone." 

The moment came. He couldn't 
wait forever. He swung around 
and looked at her with a slow, 
ironical smile. He had known 
more beautiful women, but none, 
perhaps, who knew their limitations as well as she did. 

Una always wore that spotless 
white shirt, open-necked and 
tucked tightly into the waistband 
of her sharply creased bottlegreen slacks. Perhaps it was pessimistic to think the worst of what 
one didn't know, but Ord took it 
for granted that Una's only good 
points of figure were the neat 
waist and upper half and the 
length of leg that her customary 
outfit displayed. 

There was a slight irregularity 



about her forehead which she 
treated adroitly by always having 
a cascade of her beautiful ashblonde hair over one side of her 
face. Her teeth were splendid in 
a subtle half -smile ; she never 
allowed herself more. There was 
just a hint at the top button of 
her chaste, irhpeccable shirt that 
her skin wasn't all of a uniform 
satin smoothness, but suspicion 
was never allowed to grow to certainty. 

"fJOW long now, Colin?" Una 
asked. "I don't watch time 
as you do. Where could they be, 
if they started whenever the beam 
failed?" 

"I haven't worked it out since 
you asked the last time." He 
couldn't still the tremor in his 
voice. "But they could be very 
close." 

There was a hint of regret in 
her nod. 

Ord looked past her at the 
blank wall opposite the observation windows. He wasn't cramped. 

The space station three billion 
six hundred million miles from 
the Sun was designed for one 
man who would always be alone, 
who would spend two years in his 
own company for the somewhat 
fabulous salary of a space station 
officer, and everything had been 
done to make the quarters seem 
roomy and comfortable without 
giving a chilling impression of 



134 




 



emptiness. There was the observatory, the machine room, the 
lounge, the workshop, the bedroom, the bathroom, the storerooms, even a spare room into 
which Una disappeared, though 
it had not been provided for Una 
or anyone like her. 

As Ord looked at the blank 
wall, he was thinking of the activity on Earth, six years before, 
when one of the three Pluto directional radio beams had failed. 
There were plenty of beams left 
to guide ships through space, but 
the sudden failure of Station 
Two's beam must have had some 
effect on almost every interplanetary trip. Five minutes on the 
Moon trip, at certain times; two 
or three days on journtys to Mars 
or Venus, depending on the relative positions of the starting 
point, destination, and the two 
remaining Pluto beams; weeks, 
even months more required for 
the run to some of the asteroids 
and the satellites of the outer 
planets. 

Two spokes of the directional 
wheel remained, but that left a 
great gaping angle of a hundred 
and twenty degrees, served only 
feebly by the beams from ships' 
destinations, with no powerful 
universal beam to reinforce them. 

The situation was not new. 
Some day there would be so 
many -line -of -flight beams in the 
Solar System that ships wouldn't 




have to know the beams they 
were on. They would merely 
point their noses where they 
wanted to go and cast off, like 
so many galleons sailing before 
the wind. But as yet there was 
not enough interplanetary travel 
to make the duplication of beams 
practicable. 

If a beam failed, it failed, and 
more than six years had to pass 
before it could be put in operation again, unless the failure occurred at a convenient time — 
when a ship was well on the way 
to relieve a station officer and 
check the equipment, say. 
Through history, however, failure of anything man-made had 
tended to come almost always at 
the most inconvenient times. 

Ord followed the ship in his 
mind through its six-year journey. A week to prepare. Two days 
to reach the Moon. Three weeks 
for the run to Mars, which would 
have been sixteen days if Station 
Two had been sending out its 
beam. Then trouble. Only the 
little Ganymede beam, in the positions of the planets and their 
satellites at the time, to help the 
repair ship on its way from Mars. 
Almost nine months to Jupiter. 
But at least, by that time, the 
ship would have some velocity to 
help the rockets on the remaining 
three billion two hundred million 
miles . . . and the long, dreary 
search for the silent speck in 



{HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



135 



space that was the space station. 

Eleven months altogether, with 
the beam; over six years without it. 

One thing that helped Ord bear 
the extra five years of solitude he 
had to spend aboard the station, 
thousands of millions of miles 
from the nearest man, was the 
thought of the accumulated pay 
he would collect. The station officers were necessary, and the various space lines had to accept 
responsibility for them. 

He would be set up for life, at 
twenty-nine, when he got back to 
Earth at last. 

UNA shrugged. "Oh, well, it's 
been nice knowing you. And 
I mean that.'' 

"It would be for you, Una. But 
that was because of the others 
before you. I learned a lot." 

"You've just broken rule one," 
she said lightly. "Never talk of 
'the others.' Just be careful you 
don't break rule two." 
"What rule is that?" 
"You should know. You want 
me to break it? Most particularly, 
never talk of any others to come." 

She made a gesture of dismissal, as if she were tearing the 
whole subject out of a notebook, 
crumpling it and throwing it 
•way. 

"Shall we play chess?" she 
asked lightly. "It's a long time 
since we did." 



"All right. But not here. Let's 
go into the lounge." 

He led the way through the 
station as if she didn't know it as 
well as he did. He set up the 
pieces rapidly, through long practice. Una didn't sit down opposite him, but poised on the edge 
of the sofa. She always kept her 
long, graceful line intact. 

They had just made the first 
oblique reference to something 
which had been growing for a 
long time. Undoubtedly Ord was 
growing tired of Una. It was nobody's fault, or his. in so far M 
it was anyone's. There was a hint 
of farewell in the chess game. 
One for the road, so to speak. 

Una played quickly and decisively. One particularly rapid 
move brought the usual complaint from Ord. 

"I wish you'd pay more attention," he protested. "If you win, 
I look silly, taking so much time 
to think things out. And if I win, 
you lose nothing because you obviously weren't trying." 

Una laughed. "It's just ■ 
game," she answered. 

She won the first game. "Luck," 
Ord grunted, without heat. "You 
never saw the danger of that rook 
to bishop's fourth." 

"Perhaps not. But look how 
well I followed it up, so it really 
doesn't matter, does it?" 

They played the inevitable second game, and inevitably, also* 




 



Ord won it. Like all chess players 
who have won a game they knew 
they could win when and how 
tliry wished, he felt relaxed and 
pleased with himself. 
He yawned. 

Una rose. "I can take a hint," 
she said. 

"No, please . . ." 

She smiled at him and disappeared into her room. 

Ord spent a long time looking 
at the blank door. He had been 
warned against solitosis (Latin 
xolitarius, from solus, and the 
Greek -os/s), but for him it wasn't 
so bad. He still knew the truth; 
perhaps that was it. After all this 
time, he was still in no danger of 
really believing what was not so. 
For example . . . 

TIE got up and went through 
to the machine room. Among 
other things, this room presented 
a complete picture of conditions 
throughout the entire station 
from moment to moment. He 
could sit before the dials and 
switches and meters and check on 
everything from the outside temperature to the air pressure in the 
farthest storeroom. 

He could see quite plainly, for 
example, that the temperature in 
Una's room, as of that moment, 
was minus 1 10 degrees Centigrade. A long way above absolute zero, certainly — but a long 
way below comfortable bedroom 



temperature. Moreover, the air 
pressure was only eight pounds. 

In a word, though he had :;een 
Una enter the room, he might 
see her come out of it again. But 
Una wasn't there. The door had 
never been open. 

There was no Una. 

Knowing that fact was a big 
factor. Long ago, he had feared 
a time when he wouldn't know 
such things. He still feared it 
now and then. 

Yet if he pressurized the spare 
room, raised its temperature and 
then walked in, he would see Una 
asleep in the bed. If he touched 
her, she would be real. If he 
slapped her face with his hand, 
his palm would sting, and she 
would awaken, resentful. If he 
stabbed her, she would die, and 
he would have to take the trouble 
of burying her out in space. 

That was all real — to him. 

But he could see and appreciate the facts indicated by the 
dials. Even though he was tired 
of Una, however, he could not 
merely tell her to vanish and she 
would be gone. He had had to 
provide a ship to bring her here, 
and he would have to provide 
another to take her away. 

Solitosis was no new thing; it 
had been discovered soon after 
space flight. Unfortunately, no 
one had so far discovered what 
to do about it, except remove the 
conditions that produced it. Space 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



Is not merely a void; it's emptier 
than that — empty of horizon, sky, 
soft sunlight, ground and greenery and buildings, empty of time 
and continuity of one's history, 
either as an individual or member of the human race. Worst of 
all, it's empty of people. A hermit may deliberately escape civilization, but leave him alone on 
a deserted world and he turns 
psychotic. That, in short, is solitosis. 

■There was a reason for the fact 
that there was a space station officer — he could handte the maintenance of the station — and a reason for the fact that there was 
only one. Two men together were 
not enough to protect each other 
from solitosis. The critical number was about forty. But to leave 
forty men on a space station was 
unevonomic. To leave fewer, yet 
more than one, was dangerous to 
all. for solitosis could be homicidal. 

The natural solution was to 
leave one man, who would naturally become a solitosis victim, 
but generally didn't harm himself and could be restored to complete sanity when he was relieved 
—simply by returning him to 
Earth. 

It was simple. It worked. Of 
Course, station officers had to be 
paid to take two years of insanity. It was rarely completely 
pleasant or completely unpleas


ant. The result took different 
forms H but always there were 
pleasures and pains. 

No station officer was ever in 
a position tb know what he was 
in for before he signed on. for no 
man was allowed to subject himself to solitosis twice. 

But Ord was more interested 
in the problem of Una. He knew, 
of course, that he wouldn't work 
any solution out and do something about it. His particular 
brand of solitosis didn't work 
like that. Certainly, somewhere 
in his mind, a decision was being 
reached. But what that was was 
hidden from him. He had to wait 
and see what happened. But being tired of Una, he knew the 
general lines. 

|>UTTING on his suit. Ord 
™ went outside. Fifty years before, scores of ships had come in 
on the beam from the station, 
which had been held on its course 
by six freighters. Each ship in 
the fleet had dragged or pushed 
a lump of rock that nobody 
wanted, for the station, when 
complete, had to have mass. 
Gradually, a planet was built — a 
very small planet, but enough to 
form a base for the station and 
enable it to follow Pluto in its 
orbit with a minimum expenditure of power. The station on 
Pluto itself was already in operation, and Station Three was be


tfl 




 



ing set up concurrently. 

Bouncing gently over the rocks 
of the dark, airless world that was 
only big enough to hold a small 
ship to its surface, Ord paused 
at the tiny cruiser Una had used. 
It was as real as she was, no 
more, no less. He forgot the details of the story that explained 
Una's arrival. It was so completely preposterous that any girl 
should arrive alone at any space 
station, in any kind of ship, that 
he hadn't bothered to think up a 
convincing explanation. Una, like 
the others, just appeared. She 
had had a story which she was 
prepared to tell, but he had cut it 
short. That was most satisfactory 
all around. 

The ship, he saw, was not obviously damaged. He jumped up 
on the hull experimentally. He 
thought that he landed on it and 
stood twelve feet above the surface of the planet. 

He searched hazily for an explanation. Perhaps he had picked 
a spur of rock and made it the 
ship. Perhaps his eyes manufactured twelve feet of height. He 
had never inspected the ship 
closely, and he didn't now; it 
would only demand a lot of tiring mental effort. He wouldn't 
know consciously that he was 
constructing everything he saw, 
but that was what he would be 
doing. 

He bounced back to the sta


tion and into the airless machine 
room to examine the beam equipment once more. There was nothing seriously wrong with it. He 
could repair it in a few hours if 
he had the tools and six hands, 
which was more than most space 1 
station officers could say. 

That was the difficulty about 
a job like Ord's — station officers 
had to be experienced. But how 
could they be experienced when 
they could never have done the 
job before? 

He cast a last glance around 
the machine room and left. 

Ord did think of going back to 1 
Una's ship, finding something 
wrong and repairing it, so that it 
would be possible for her to go. 
But that would be humoring his 
solitosis. He still preferred to be : 
as sane as possible. 

He had involuntarily produced ' 
men as companions once, but it 
hadn't worked. He could never 
become sufficiently interested in 
their physical appearance to 
make them real. He might talk' 
with them and enjoy talking, but 
they were always ghosts and '■ 
looked it. The women had never 
been ghosts. 

In fact, he had been afraid, 
once, that the time would come 1 
when he would actually believe 
in them. And, of course, he had 
often explored the possibility that: 
when someone actually came, he 
would think it was part of an


HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



13* 



other hallucination. But there 
seemed little reason to fear that 
while it was still so easy to prove 
to himself that he was alone at 
the station. 

He took off his suit and washed 
and shaved carefully, having decided, long since, that the normal 
habits of human existence should 
be carefully preserved. He dressed 
neatly, though the station was 
warm and there was no real need 
for clothes, and, when he slept, 
he wore pajamas. 

There had been a time — the 
time of Suzy and Margo — when 
the apparent life at the station 
was what might have been expected of a solitary man. But he 
discovered, quite plainly and simply, that there were too many 
complications. Una had perhaps 
been too much of a swing in the 
other direction. His relations with 
her, Ord thought wryly, wouldn't 
have been out of place in a Victorian book for boys and girls, 
except that he didn't mind her 
smoking. 

TTE slept for twelve hours. Qnce 
he wakened, half convinced 
he had heard something, but he 
was sleepy, didn't want to move, 
and had no intention of pandering 
to his own neurosis. 

It was not until he had been 
up for hours that he began to 
wonder why Una didn't appear. 
Perhaps she was ill. Perhaps, 



though he didn't think of it that 
way, he had decided unconsciously to have her die on him, linger* 
ingly and effectively. 

He sighed, went to the machine 
room and brought the temperature and air pressure of Una's 
room to normal. Then he went in. 

She was gone, but her perfume 
lingered in the air.. He went to 
the observation room and looked 
for her ship. It was gone, too. 

He was a little disgusted, but 
he didn't blame himself. It was 
easier and more satisfactory ta 
blame Una. She might at least 
have said good-by. All in all, he 
had liked her. He would have 
liked to meet the real Una, if 
there was one somewhere. He had 
tired of her chiefly because she 
had never become a genuine, 
credible character. She had always been true to type, whereas 
real people weren't. 

He stayed in the observatory 
and looked for a ship. He smiled 
at the thought that what he believed to be a ship, bringing another girl with another fantastic 
story of being lost in space, might 
turn out to be the relief ship. 

He was glad his solitosis had 
not taken the form that Benson's 
had. Benson had lost all sense of 
time. He had spent millions of 
subjective years waiting for the 
relief ship, though Benson only 
had to wait the regulation two 
years, Benson hadn't minded 



HO 




 



much. He thought he had turned 
into a mental giant. As it turned 
out, his functioning IQ had really 
gone up some fifteen points. It 
came down again eleven points, 
but certainly Benson had no reason to regret his two years of 
solitude. Nevertheless, Ord was 
glad it hadn't taken him the same 
way. 

As he expected, the ship was 
there, curving in for a landing. It 
wasn't the relief ship, since it was 
too small. It was, in fact, far too 
small to be capable of the trip 
from Earth with no beam to assist it. 

Ord was on the merry-go-round 
again. If he hadn't done a good 
job on the last hours of Una, he 
had made up for it with the first 
few hours of whoever it was. The 
little ship overshot, handled exactly as women often handled 
spacecraft. It took a long, fivehour sweep that had Ord biting 
his nails. Moreover, it wasn't a 
rocket ship at all. Perhaps this 
time the girl — naturally, it would 
be a girl — had an explanation for 
the impossible to beat all explanations. She was certainly keeping him in suspense. 

But at last the ship was down, 
and Ord, already in his spacesuit, 
hurried out to it. A figure emerged 
as he reached it, and through the 
faceplate he saw a face which was 
clear from the start. 

The girl gestured toward the 



ship, uselessly. He indicated the 
space station. She shook her head 
inside the huge helmet, pointing 
to the ship. He was puzzled. This 
was new. 

Suddenly, to indicate her 
meaning, she bent down and lifted 
the end of the ship, then looked 
up at him. He understood at last. 
She was afraid it wasn't safe to 
leave the ship there. She thought 
it might blow away. 

He laughed and tried to reassure her without words. It was 
true enough that even a light 
breeze might be enough to break 
the feeble attraction of the planet 
for the ship. But on a tiny manmade world, with no atmosphere, 
that was no problem. He demonstrated, getting below the ship 
and heaving. It sailed up slowly, 
and for a moment Ord almost 
shared the girl's fear that it would 
never return. But then gravity 
caught it and the ship returned 
gently. It was clear that it would 
take considerable force to break 
the hold of the small world on it. 

The girl turned from it, ready 
to go with Ord to the space station. 

^~VRD shut the airlock and began to divest himself of his 
suit. The girl, however, still wasn't 
satisfied. She looked about for 
meters to assure herself that the 
pressure was sufficient. Gravely, 
Ord pointed them out. Then she 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 




opened her helmet and took a 
slow, cautious breath. 

"You must be Baker," she said. 

That was another shock. Baker 
was the previous station officer, 
and Ord had all but forgotten his 
name — actually, until she mentioned it, the name had been forgotten. For a moment. Ord wondered wildly if the girl was one of 
Baker's dreams, seven years late. 
But Baker's solitosis hadn't taken 
that form. 

"No, Ord," he said. "Colin 
Ord. rt 

"Before we go any further." 
she said, "just how does solitosis 
affect you?" 

142 



This, too, was new. 
"Just makes me see things that 
aren't there," replied Ord cautiously. 

"And you know there's nothing 
there?" 

"Sometimes." 
"Do you know I'm here?" 
Ord grinned. "I'm not even 
wondering about it." 

Suddenly the girl was holding 
a gun pointed at him. 

"One thing you can be sure of," 
she told him. "This gun is here. 
I don't want to be unpleasant, 
but I think we should remove 
misunderstandings. I'm not God's 
little gift to lonely space station 


 



officers, and any time you do anything that indicates you think I 
am, this comes out and it may do 
some damage. That clear?" 

"Very. I told you my name. 
What's yourr?" 

"Elsa Catterline. You want to 
know why I'm here, of course." 

"Not particularly." 

She looked up warily at that. 
But she went on lifting off her 
helmet and removing her spacesuit. Ord made no move to help her. There was always the possibility that it might really be dangerous. 

"I'll tell you all the same," she 
continued. "I killed a man— why 
and how doesn't matter. I had 
access to an experimental ship. 
That one out there. I thought if 
I disappeared for about two 
years ..." 

"Don't labor over it." said Ord. 
"I'm not asking questions." 
"I know. I wonder why." 
She won her battle with the 
suit and emerged. Ord's eyes widened. She was beautiful, really 
beautiful, but he had expected 
that. The unexpected thing was 
that she wore the kind of outfit 
girls in magazine stories wore in 
similar circumstances — white nylon shorts and what might have 
been called the minimum bra. 

Once there would have been 
nothing surprising in that, but 
for years he had been very careful and restrained. He had tried 
sex undiluted, and then had gone 
back to diluting it in self-protection. It was a long time since any 
of his girls had been so feminine 
and made it so obvious. 

In fact, for the first time, he 
seriously considered the possibility that she was real. Real people 
were sometimes more fantastic 
than the wildest imaginings. 
"I wonder," he said. 
"Don't," she snapped. 
"I was only thinking," he went 



"That was for the time when I 
still wasn't sure you weren't violent. I think I can get on with 
you. Ord." 

He nodded coldly. The pattern 
was clear now. 

"I get it," he said. 

The trouble was that it did 
nothing to settle the question of 
whether she was real or not. That 
she could be merely Una's successor was so obvious that there 
was no need to go into it. But it 
was also possible — unlikely, yet 
possible — that a girl of the type 
she seemed to be could have 
picked a space station as a hideout and could have acted as she 
had acted, was acting, and would 
act. 

He was suddenly tired of the 
whole business. He wanted Earth. 
It had been a dull throb all this 
time, but now it flared to a mad 
longing, as it did every few 
months. Ft was all very well for 
Wordsworth to talk about that 
inward eye which is the bliss of 
solitude. Get Wordsworth out 
there and let him run a space 
Station. 

Ord wanted the presence of 
people about him that would keep 
i him sane. He wanted to put women back in their place in his 
i life. He wanted to be able to 
forget for hours, even days at a 
time, that there were such things 
as w-«»nen. 

Only twenty-four hours before. 



he had been congratulating himself that sol itosis hadn't really 
got him. And now he didn't know 
whether Elsa was real or not. 
Either way. it was as bad. If she 
was real, he should have known 
it at once. If she was just another 
ghost, he should have known that, 
too. 

"I'm going out to have a look 
at your ship," he said. 

He thought she would object, 
but she merely shrugged. 

"You might have left your suit 
on, then," she told him. 

Twenty minutes later he was 
inside the little ship. He made no 
examination. That could come after he had settled something else. 
There was light and there was 
air. Fourteen pounds per square 
inch, the meters said. 

He found a gasoline lighter and 
manipulated it clumsily with his 
big, semi-rigid gloves. The flame 
flared. But that meant nothing. 
If there was no lighter, and he 
saw it, he might also see it burn 
where there was no air. 

There was a valve on his suit 
to test air pressure. He opened it. 
The little dial swung around to 
fourteen pounds. The question 
was, had he really opened th« 
valve? He tried again, concentrating, making sure he really had 
hold of the valve. A half-turn was 
all that was necessary. Slowly, 
painfully, he turned it. He saw it 
turn. There was still cigarette smoke in the small, cramped 
quarters. He watched it swirl into 
the little box at his hip. The needle registered fourteen pounds. 

He felt the sweat on his forehead. Trying to deceive himself, 
to get a jump ahead of his own 
mind, he lunged out into the open 
and twisted the valve again. He 
told himself he was only testing 
it. He looked down. 

No pressure. 

He raised his heavy arms and 
stumbled like a sleepwalker back 
to the ship's airlock. Still keeping 
his arms raised, he entered the 
control room again. Only then did 
he look down. 

The dial, untouched, still read 
no pressure. There was no air on 
the ship. There was no ship. Now 
that he knew that, he was able to 
open and close the valve. 

Elsa was no more real than 
Una. 

IT was easier, then, to check and 
doublecheck. Very soon he was 
walking through the walls of the 
ship she had come in. It was simpler to check on it than on Elsa. 
She would remain real to the 
last, but the ship was only a 
minor part of the illusion. 

He had had some bad moments 
in the last hour. It had become 
all too clear that he was losing 
his last defenses in his fight for 
sanity in insanity. He had won 
his battle again, but perhaps this 



was the last time he would win 
it. The next time he might fail 
to prove the illusion. That, after this, wouldn't necessarily 
prove the reality. 

Elsa was finished. She had 
been too real and not real enough. 
Why had he ever let Una go? 

He plodded back to the station and removed his suit. Ht 
found Elsa in the lounge, squatting on her heels and looking like 
a magazine cover. 

"Out," he said bluntly. "It was 
a mistake your coming here. I'm 
sorry." 

There was a flash of movement 
as she dived for the gun. Just in 
time he tensed himself, reminding 
himself of what he had learned, 
and when she fired at him he felt 
nothing. 

He grinned back at her. 

"The instinct of self-preservation is too strong," he said. "I 
can't let myself be shot, whatever 
happens." 

He stepped forward. She fought 
him for the gun. She bit his wrist, 
and it hurt. But he got the gun. 

"If you shoot me, nothing happens," he pointed out. "But if I 
shoot you, you die. You know 
that?" 

She nodded sullenly and got 
up, put on her suit and left. 

In twenty minutes, her ship 
took off. Ord didn't even watch 
it out of sight. 

He still held the gun in his 

hand. He threw it in a drawer. It 
would remain there until he forgot it. Then there would be no 
gun. 

From now on, he decided, there 
would be no surrender to solitosis. There would be no more 
Elsas or Su2ys or Margos. When 
he weakened, he would bring Una 
back, or he might have another 
try at male companionship. 

FOR days, he thought he was 
winning his battle. He slt.pt 
well, and he remained alone. He 
spent a lot of time in the observation room, but he never saw a 
ship. 

The trouble was that the fight 
was not on the conscious level of 
his mind. There would be no 
warning before he would suddenly see a ship, without having 
taken any conscious decision. 
Then it would be too late to tell 
himself there was no ship. 

It came at last. There was a 
tiny point of light moving visibly. 
As soon as he saw it, he left* the 
observation room and fought 
with himself. He might convince 
the other part of his mind that 
it was a mistake, and when he 
went back to the observation 
room it would be a mistake — the 
moving point of light would be 
gone. It had happened before. 

But solitosis was progressive, 
he thought dully, as he stood in 
the observation room four hours 



later and saw the ship. If it didn't 
get you under in one year, it did 
it in two. Or four or six. Una, intelligent and restrained, had been 
the last stand of a mind under 
constant fire. Una was part of 
the disease, yes, but a disease 
still controlled firmly and confidently. When he let Una go, he 
had been giving up. 

The ship this time was a lifeboat from a larger vessel. That 
wasn't new. Suzy had come in a 
lifeboat. So had Dorothy, later, 
from the same mythical ship. 

Ord stood and watched it land, 
concentrating so that his hair 
tingled with sweat. He wasn't trying to exorcize the ship; that 
would have been impossible. He 
was merely building into himself 
a powerful, binding resolve to 
know on this and all future occasions the truth from the lie. He 
would not drive the new visitor 
away as he had driven Elsa when 
he discovered she was another 
phantom. But he must know. Until Elsa came, he had always 
known. He mustn't lose that, 
whatever else he lost. 

He saw a spacesuited figure 
emerge from the lifeboat, and 
then he went down to the airlock 

and waited. 

He must be a hopeless romantic, he thought while he waitedSolitosis showed people a lot 
about themselves. There had 
been plenty of opportunity for realism, as opposed to romance, 
but he had never takes it. 

The airlock opened. For a moment the face behind the plate of 
the helmet was shadowy and illdefined. Then it cleared gradually, like a lantern slide carefully 
focused, sharp and clear, on a 
screen. 

Ord sighed in relief. He hadn't 
proved yet that the new girl was 
another wraith, but it was going 
to be possible, after all. With 
Elsa's face as clear from the first 
second as his own in a mirror, 
how could he know? 

rpHE girl opened her face-plate. 
* "Colin Ord?" she said briskly, "I'm Dr. Lynn of Four Star 
Lines. Marilyn Lynn." She grinned, a friendly, put-you-at-yourease grin. A professional grin — 
part of the bedside manner of a 
good doctor, male or female, 
young or old. "Cacophanous," she 
added, "but I've had quite a 
while to get used to it." 

"Very nice," he said. "First remark of second castaway on desert island. Do you tell roe the 
rest of the story straight away, 
©r are you going to be coy?" 

She frowned — putting the fresh 
patient in his place. 

"I'm not going to tell you anything," she said, "until I've found 
out a little more about you." 

"Excellent!" Ord answered. 
"Tone, inflection and diction just 



right. It all fits.** 

He saw with further relief that 
she was of the Una type. She was 
beautiful, naturally, but not fantastic. And as she stripped off 
her suit, he saw that she wore 
slacks and a tunic, which was 
reasonable. She looked intelligent. 
She wasn't too young — at least 
his own age. Perhaps he was still 
the master. 

She looked at him, too, with 
the eye of a diagnostician. 

"Don't bother," he told her. "I 
see things that aren't there. Particularly people." 

She nodded. "I see. So you 
don't believe I'm here?" 

"Well, I ask you," he said 
skeptically. "Would you, if you 
were me?" He remembered a line 
of nonsense verse — Lear, probably 
— and quoted, "What would you 
do if you were me to prove that 
you were you?" 

She was weighing the situation 
calmly. She didn't seem to mind 
Ord seeing what she was doing. 

"Do you know I'm not real?*' 
she asked. 

"No. That comes with time. At 
least, it always has so far." 

"You mean you've always 
proved to yourself that your — 
visitors were mere fantasy?" 

"With a struggle." he admitted. 

"Interesting. That looks like a 
case of controlled solitosis. I 
never heard of one before." 

Ord laughed cynically. "That's 



152 




 



right, feed my ego. It always 
comes to that in the end." 

The girl gestured at her discarded suit. "You can't tell 
whether that's real or not?" 

"Not at once. Eventually, yes 
—I hope." 

He led her to the lounge. She 
looked around and nodded. She 
seemed pleased. 

"Everything neat and tidy. You 
have no idea what a pleasure it is 
to meet you, Mr. Ord." 

"That doesn't make you real," 
replied Ord rudely. "They all say 
that." 

She looked at him in surprise. 
"Why should I want to make you 
accept me as real?" she asked. 

It was like a physical* blow. 
Ord had no idea why, but that 
didn't lessen the effect. 

"That's right," he said slowly. 
*'Why should you?" 

"Tell me about the others," she 
suggested. 

Like any good doctor, she gave 
the impression that what motivated her questions was not clinical but personal interest. The 
practicing doctor, Ord mused, was 
primarily an artist, not a scientist. 

He told her. He edited the story 
a little, but he told it fairly, with 
particular detail on Elsa and Una, 
his most recent companions. 

"Una is interesting," Marilyn 
said. "She was the only one who 
knew everything that you do. She 



didn't let you talk about it, but 
she knew." 

A UTOMATICALLY, Ord be^»-gan to make coffee. Marilyn 
watched him. 

"When will you know whether 
I'm real or not?" she asked casually. 

"Can't say. Perhaps in five 
minutes, perhaps not for hours. 
I—" 

"Don't tell me how you do 
it," she said quickly. "Not yet. 
Do it first. Does it involve me? 
I mean, you don't shoot me to see 
if I die, or anything, do you?" 

He grinned. "Nothing like that. 
If I shot you, you would die — 
like the witches in history. They , 
died if they were, and they died 
if they weren't." 

"Your mind has remained agile 
enough." 

"Naturally. I never heard of 
solitosis inhibiting intelligence. 
Did you?" 

She was significantly silent. 

He raised his eyebrows. "You 
mean it often happens? Or always?" 

"Not always. Frequently. It's 
pretty obvious, isn't it? The mind 
unbalanced naturally functions 
less well than the normal mind." 

"Benson was the exception that 
proves the rule?" 

She nodded. She knew who 
Benson was. That, like almost 
everything else, proved nothing.

She held up her cup before her. 
"Is this part of the test?" she 
risked. "Whether more coffee is 
actually drunk than you drink 
yourself?" 

"No. that doesn't help. It would 
")C very easy for me to make half 
-vhat I thought I made, to bring 
out one cup and think I brought 

wo, to take a nonexistent cup

His words died, for he had seen

" 'orror or sadness or "understand he couldn't be sure. 

"V" • t's the matter?" he asked. 

"I don't know. Perhaps I misunderstood." 

"Something I said?" he continued. "Easy to make half what I 
thought I made . . . you knew 
about that, surely. And bringing 
out one cup when I thought I 
brought two. Nonexistent cup, 
nonexistent girl — it can't be because I called you a nonexistent 
girl, for we've been into that before. Naturally, if there's no cup 
I'd be careful, with part of my 
mind, not to pour coffee in it . . ." 

He frowned. "There it is again. 
" 'ou trk t! not to show it this time. 

t I caught a faint shadow of 
"' f ; ^t'iing 1 s-.'d or d'd fright• ■: you, or makes you unhappy, 
nr maybe just interests you. I'm 
not handing you imaginary cof


fee, I am? It seems real." 

She was completely in control of 
herself again. She laughed. "No, 
not that. You're handing me real 
coffee, which means that part of 
your mind already knows I'm 
real. But it's the part you don't 
trust and can't touch." 

"I'm not doing something I 
don't know I'm doing, am I?" 

She shook her head. "Since 
you're bound to think about it, 
whatever I say — it was just something you said. What you know 
you said. And it's not horrible or 
frightening and there's no earthly 
reason why it should make me 
sad. It's just something I didn't 
know." 

"You won't tell me any more 
than that?" 

She answered the question with 
another. "Don't your puppets do 
what you tell themr r ' 

"No. You know that," 

She put down the cup. "I'll 
wash the dishes," she said lightly. 
"Will that prove anything?" 

"Sometimes, for an intelligent 
girl, you're very dumb," he said 
gloomily. "Next time they were 
used, I could just imagine they 
were washed, couldn't I?" 

"Of course." Her eyes — brown 
eyes, deep-set under thin eyebrows — followed him as he rose 
suddenly. "Where are you going?" 

"To find out if you're real." 
"My ship. Go ahead."

/"VRD went to the airlock and 

put on his spacesuit. He 
thought for a while about what 
he might have said that brought 
that curious expression to Marilyn's face. But it was very clear 
that he could never, unaided, 
work out the problem. What he 
had said was so simple, so obviously true . . . and eventually she 
would tell him about it. It didn't 
matter. 

There was nothing in what had 
happened so far, or what* she had 
said, that settled the problem of 
the moment. Possibly, to add to 
all the other arguments against 
the possibility of Marilyn being a 
real woman, there was the consideration that, if she were, she 
would insist on it. But, after all, 
would she? She was a doctor, 
perhaps a psychiatrist. She knew 
solitosis. 

A doctor of any kind, he told 
himself decidedly, encountering 
anyone with solitosis, would most 
certainly play along with him, 
telling him nothing, denying 
nothing, insisting on nothing. 

That, he realized vaguely, was 
of vital importance. He was not 
at all sure why. 

The test which had worked on 
Elsa's ship was as good as any. 
he thought- It might not work 
twice, but he would do his best 
to see that it did. 

He opened the valve on his suit, 
making quite certain it registered 



atmosphere nil. Then he grasped 
his gloves together and strained 
his arms to pull them apart. 
When he opened the lifeboat's 
airlock, he kept his hands linked 
by his thumbs. In a few moments 
he stood in the control room of 
the little ship, which was the only 
room there, and his hands were 
still linked. 

The needle registered fifteen 
pounds. A dull feeling of failure 
numbed him. 

He had concentrated with all 
his power, making sure the valve 
was really open and that he never 
had a chance to close it. He tried 
again, opening and closing it. 

He might have known that 
each new scheme only worked 
once. He thought, trying to be 
calm. 

Solitosis wasn't a suicidal psychosis, or at least he had heard 
it Was never. He had seen it in 
books. One small indication of 
that had been when Elsa shot 
him and he felt nothing, though 
she had looked perfectly real. 
He could be hurt, as when she 
bit him, but not seriously. 

He battered his fist against the 
bulkhead. There was no straight 
spur of rock that height where 
the ship had landed. A bulkhead 
was there, or there was nothing. 

His glove was made to resist a 
vacuum, but it wasn't cushioned 
against impact. His hand hurt 
and went on hurting. 



HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



155 



Grimly, he continued beating 
the bulkhead until he could not 
force himself to bear any more 
pain. , 

There was a bulkhead there. 
Therefore, there was a ship. His 
undamaged hand went to his 
faceplate. He hesitated, then reminded himself that solitosis 
wasn't suicidal. He opened the 
plate. He felt his nose, his eyes, 
his chin. He pinched his cheek. 

The faceplate was open and 
he could breathe. 

Only two possibilities were left. 
Either Marilyn and all that went 
with her were real, or he was over 
the top at last, absolutely in the 
grip of solitosis, so that he 
couldn't even be certain he had 
left the space station. 

And if Marilyn was real . . . 

He collapsed weakly as an insidious thought beat the spirit 



156 



G 




out of him. He was ready to believe in Marilyn, but there was 
one thing he could not ignore. 
Solitosis got everyone. People 
could fight it, but they could 
never hold it off. Yet it had very 
clearly not affected Marilyn. You 
knew solitosis when you saw it. 
Even he would know. 

He could not say whether sheexisted subjectively or objectively — could he say whether the 
station existed, whether Earth existed, whether there was a Galaxy? Was there any essential difference between Una and his 
mother or his sister? Were they 
all creatures of his mind? 

Life itself might be a thought 
in his mind. Matter could be 
merely a concept. We existed. 
"/ think, therefore I am." He 
could accept that. Could he accept anything else? 



He forced himself fiercely back 
to normalcy, limiting himself to 
Marilyn. She existed, and because 
she came in a ship in which he 
could open his faceplate, she existed more than Una had. 

Hanging determinedly onto 
that idea, he closed the plate and 
stumbled back to the station. It 
seemed very far away. He had 
taken too much out of himself. 
Mental effort could be even more 
exhausting than physical exertion. Whatever the truth might 
be, he had fought too hard toward it or away from it. 

He got through the airlock into 
the station and, safely inside, fell 
on his face. 

rpWENTY-FOUR hours later, 
he knew that nc had proved 
Marilyn's existence beyond reasonable doubt. He had been ill, 
and she had tended him. 

"You proved what you wanted 
to prove," she told him, when the 
worst was over. "But was it 
worth it?" 

"It was worth it," he said, sitting up in bed. "No wonder whole 
philosophies have been founded 
on reality. It's the most important thing there is to a man." 

She shook her head, smiling. 

"Merely to you." she said. "Solitosis naturally affects what matters most to the individual. But 
we needn't talk about that." 

There was a warmth, a kind


HALLUCINATION ORBIT 



ness about her that none of the 
phantoms could ever have had, 
because they were all reflections 
of himself. He had made them 
what they were. 

"How did you avoid solitosis?" 
he asked. 

She smiled again. "The only 
way. There are fifty men and 
women in the Lioness, the relief 
ship. That number is well above 
the critical point. It will still be 
e while before they can land a 
big ship on this little world, but 
ell the time while they're maneuvering, they'll be keeping me sane 
by being there. I know they are, 
you see. When you do, you'll improve." 

Ord relaxed. Long, involved explanations were never satisfying. 
It was the simple explanation that 
one could instantly believe. 

"That will take a while," he 
said. "I don't mind how long it 
takes." 

He saw the same shadow pass 
across her face. 

"Tell me," he said quietly. 
"Look at me." 

He looked. She was strong, quietly beautiful. She still wore her 
tunic and slacks. He even saw, 
with faint regret, that, while she 
wore no wedding ring, there was 
h white band on her finger where 
one would have been. 

"Yes?" he urged. 

"I didn't realize until you 
talked of a nonexistent girl," 



Marilyn said quietly. "I was real, 
yes, but not your picture of me.** 

"No, it's not so terrible." Marilyn went on. "Almost everything 
was as you thought. It's natural 
to send a doctor first to visit any 
sick person. I'm a doctor, and I 
was a girl once. But that was 
forty years ago. And you had to 
make me young and beautiful." 

With an effort, Ord laughed 
naturally. "Was that all? You 
had me thinking — " 

The old doctor didn't hear him. 
She wasn't thinking of her courage in coming to him alone, but 
remembered that all doctors take 
risks. 

"It was pleasant to be a girl 
again," she said reflectively. "I 
could see myself in your eyes, 
and — almost — I was young again. 
I like you. If it hadn't been too 
completely ridiculous, I'd have 
fallen in love with you." 

"As I grow old in the next few 
weeks, Ord," she told him, "you'll 
be recovering. It will show you 
how your case is progressing. 
When you see me as I really am, 
you'll be all right." 

He put his hand gently on her 
arm. He was thinking of her courage in coming on ahead of the relief ship, alone, because she might 
be able to help a man who could 
not be quite sane. 

"I think," he said, "I see you 
now as you really are."
