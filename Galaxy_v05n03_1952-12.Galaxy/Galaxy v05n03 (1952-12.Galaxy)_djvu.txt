WHAT'S NEW? 



QUITE a bit is new, as you can 
see with a number of what I 
hope are astonished glances. 

You're probably getting used to 
our better paper and printing. 
But we're not. We are busily exploring the possibilities of Offset 
Lithography and are somewhat 
intimidated — the process will do 
just about everything except diaper the baby and walk the dog. 
And so you'll be seeing experiments in artwork, layout and 
typography for months to come. 

Most of them we expect to be 
successful, but we also expect to 
fall on our face with some. Don't 
hesitate to tell us when we do. 
But if there's a word of appreciation *and encouragement anywhere in your system, we'd like 
that, too. 

Visually, the most striking 
thing in this issue is the cover, of 
course. 

The artists are Jack and Bob 
Strimban and Sam Willig, and 
the name they have devised for 
this entirely new technique is 
"Camera ge." 

Now let's see how clearly it can 
be explained. That isn't an easy 
job, for much of the process ^ran 
be described only by paradoxical 
statements. 

For example, Camerage is a 
three-dimensional montage effect 



— but it's 'not a montage. Many 
photographers do montages; they 
combine sections of several pictures to make a single complex 
photograph. That has to be done 
in the dark room. 

Weir, Camerage takes the dark 
room out into the studio. All the 
objects in the picture are assembled at one time, illuminated by 
projected colored lights — some 
with plain gelatins, others with 
gelatins in abstract shapes — and 
are shot by a number of cameras 
placed on different planes. 

A panel of rheostats precisely 
controls the light that each object 
receives from every one of its 
sources. 

The effect of this is no less than 
startling. Each object Can be 
made completely opaque, translucent, or absolutely transparent 
— not just for the camera, but 
right in front of your eyes! 

Once they achieved that, the 
artists immediately went to work 
on apparent size. By controlling 
the amount, direction, color and 
shape of light, they can increase 
or decrease the size of each object 
without moving either it or the 
cameras a single inch. Again, this 
effect can be seen with the naked 
eye. 

A photographer can instantly 
recognize the advantages of the 



7 




 



process. Instead of Working by 
guess and by God in the dark 
room, he obviously would prefer 
to have everything visible and 
under exact control. That's what 
Camerage allows — photographic 
orchestration of color, shape and 
size, since the whole thing is done 
in one operation rather than 
many, and in the open studio. 

The day of lucky accidents 
leading to important discoveries 
is evidently not over, for that's 
just how Camerage was found. 
However, the Strimbans and Willig had to put in almost three 
years of exhaustive experimenting 
before the cover on this issue 
could finally be produced. 

That's right — this is the first 
appearance of Camerage. 

Using our cover as a sample, 
the artists quickly acquired- orders to go and do likewise for 
Vogue, some large advertising 
agencies, a product packager — 
and are negotiating to make a 
feature-length film with the process. 

But you'll be seeing more Camerage covers in future issues of 
GALAXY. 

TJT/HAT else is new? Well, an 
~" entire covey of writers first 
breaking into science fiction are 
coming along wonderfully well. 
It's impossible to list them all, 
especially since some haven't 
even begun to sell yet, though 



they will before long. 

F. L. Wallace ("Accidental 
Flight" and "Delay in Transit") 
is unusual in this profession. A 
mature engineer on the West 
Coast, he abruptly decided to become a writer, which he had 
wanted to be all his life. His first 
few stories have been so successful that he's thinking of going 
into it full time. He has a whole 
volcanic vat of ideas that you'll 
eventually be seeing in print, 

Mark Clifton can match him, 
though. After 20 years of being 
a labor consultant, he is writing 
full time. Remember "Star, 
Bright?" There'll be more, in collaboration with Alex Apostolides. 

Robert Sheckley, aged 23, began his career just a few months 
ago and has already piled up a 
spectacular number of sales. 
Watch him grow in the stories 
coming up. 

Now jolly good news and a 
bonanza for science fiction lovers 
overseas — GALAXY has a British and Italian edition. 

We're proud and delighted to 
welcome these new readers. 

I hope to be able to tell you 
soon what these editions will be 
like, their schedule of publication 
and, for those who like to keep 
their files complete, the cost of 
subscribing. These two foreign 
editions, incidentally, will very 
likely be only the first of many. 

— H. L. GOLD 



WHAT'S NEW?

RING AROUND THE 

By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

Something was going on, the shabby and dignified old man said 
warningty. And something was, indeed— a whole series of great 
benefits that had the world with its back pinned to the wall! 



VCKERS got up at an hour 
outrageous for its easiness because Ann had 
phoned the night before to tell 
him about a man in New York 
that she wanted him to meet. 

"I know it breaks into your 
schedule," she had said, "but I 



don't think this is something you 
can pass up." 

"I must, Ann," he'd told her. 
"I've got the writing going now 
and I can't let loose." 

"But this is the biggest thing 
that has ever broken. They picked you to talk to first, ahead of 



4 




 




all the other writers. They think 
you're the man to do it." 
"Publicity." 

"This is not publicity." 

"Forget it — I won't meet the 
guy, whoever he is," he had said 
and hung up before she could 
argue about it. 



He was frying eggs ana oacon 
and making toast and trying to 
keep one eye on the coffee maker, 
which was temperamental, when 
the doorbell rang. 

He wrapped his robe around 
him and headed for the door. 

It might be the newsboy. He

had been out on the regular collection day and the boy probably 
had seen the light in the kitchen. 

Or it might be his neighbor, 
Horton Flanders, who had moved 
in a year or so ago and who dropped over to spend an idle hour at 
the most unexpected and inconvenient times. He was an affable 
old man and distinguished-looking, although slightly moth-eaten 
and shabby at the edges, pleasant 
to talk with and a good companion, but Vickers might have wished that he were more orthodox in 
his visiting. 

It might be the newsboy or it 
might be Flanders. It could 
scarcely be anyone else at this 
early hour. 

HE opened the door and a moppet stood there, wrapped in 
a cherry -colored bathrobe and 
with bunny rabbit slippers on her 
feet. Her hair was tousled from 
a night of sleep, but her blue eyes 
sparkled at him and she gave 
him a pretty smile. 

"Good morning, Mr. Vickers," 
she said. "I woke up and couldn't 
go back to sleep and I saw the 
light on in your kitchen and I 
thought maybe you was sick." 

"I'm all right, Jane," Vickers 
told her. "I'm just getting breakfast. Maybe you would like to eat 
with me." 

"Oh, yes," said Jane. "I was 
hoping maybe if you was having 



breakfast, you'd ask me to." 

"Your mother doesn't know 
you're here, does she?" 

"Mommy and Daddy are 
asleep. This is the day that 
Daddy doesn't work and they was 
out awful late last night. I heard 
then* when they came in and 
Mommy was telling Daddy that 
he drank too much and she said 
she wouldn't go out with him, 
never again, if he drank that 
much, and Daddy . . ." 

"Jane," said Vickers, firmly, "I 
don't think your mommy and 
daddy would like you t6 be telling this." 

"Oh, they don't care. Mommy 
talks about it all the time. I 
heard her telling Mrs. Traynor 
she had half a mind to divorce 
my daddy. Mr. Vickers, what is 
divorce?" 

"I can't recall ever hearing the 
word before. Maybe we oughtn't 
to talk about what your mommy 
says. And look, you got your 
slippers all wet crossing the 
grass." 

"It's kind of wet outside. The 
dew is awful heavy." 

"You come in," said Vickers, 
"and I'll dry your feet ( and then 
we'll have some breakfast and 
call your mommy so she'll know 
where you are." 

She came in and he closed the 
door. 

"You sit on that chair," he said, 
"and I'll get a towel. I'm afraid 




 



you might catch cold." 

"Mr. Vickers, you aren't married, are you?" 

"Why, no. It happens that I'm 
not." 

"Most everyone is married," 
said Jane. "Most everyone I 
know. Why aren't you married, 
Mr. Vickers?" 

"I don't rightly know. Never 
found a girl, I guess." 

"There are lots of girls." 

"There was a girl," said Vickers. "A long time ago, there was 
a girl." 

It had been years, he realized 
moodily, since he had remembered. He had forced the years 
to obscure the memory, to hide 
it away so that he did not think 
of it, and if he did think of it, 
to make it so far away and hazy 
that he could quit thinking of it. 

But here it was again. 

There had been a girl and an 
enchanted valley they had walked 
in, a springtime valley, he remembered, with the pink of wild 
crab apple blossoms flaming on 
the hills and the song of bluebird and of lark soaring in the 
sky, and there had been a wild 
spring breeze that ruffled the 
water and blew along the grass 
so that the meadow seemed to 
flow and become a lake with 
whitecaps rolling on it. 

They had walked in the valley 
and there was no doubt that it 
was enchanted, for when he had 



gone back again, the valley wasn't 
there — or at least not the same 
valley. It had been a very different valley. 

He had walked there twenty 
years ago and through all of 
twenty years he had hidden it 
away, back in the attic of his 
mind, yet now it had returned, as 
fresh and shining as if it had 
been only yesterday. 

"Mr. Vickers," said Jane, "I 
think your toast is burning." 

- II 

AFTER Jane had gone and he 
had washed the dishes, he remembered that he had intended 
for a week or more to call Joe 
about the mice. 

"You got what?" Joe asked 
when he phoned. 

"Mice," said Vickers. "Little 
animals. They run around the 
place. You never heard of a house 
with mice?" 

"Now that's funny," said Joe. 
"A well-built place like yours, it 
shouldn't have no mice. You want 
me to come over and get rid of 
them?" 

"I guess you'll have to. I tried 
traps, but these mice don't go for 
them. Got a cat a while back and 
the cat left. Only stayed a day or 
two." 

"That's a funny thing. Cats like 
places where they can catch a 
mouse." 



RING AROUND THE SUN

"This cat was crazy," said 
Vickers. "Acted like it was spooked. Walked around on tiptoe." 

"Cats is funny animals," Joe 
confided. 

"I'm going down to the city 
today. Figure you could do it 
while I'm gone?" 

"Sure thing. The exterminating 
business is kind of slack right 
now, I'll come over ten o'clock or 
so." 

"I'll leave the front door unlocked," said Vickers. 

He hung up the phone and got 
the paper off the stoop. At his 
desk, he laid down the paper and 
picked up the sheaf of manuscript, holding it in his hand, feeling the thickness and the weight 
of it, as if by its thickness and 
its weight he might reassure himself thaT what it held was good, 
that it was not labor wasted, that 
it said the many things he wished 
to say and said them well enough 
so that other men and women 
might read the words and know 
the naked thought that lay behind the coldness of the print. 

He should not waste the day, 
he told himself. He should stay 
here and work instead of traipsing 
off to meet this man his agent 
wanted him to meet. But Ann 
had been insistent and had said 
that it was important, and even 
when he had told her about the 
car being in the garage for repairs, she still had insisted that 



he come. That story about the 
car had been a fib, of course, for 
he knew even as he told her that 
Eb would have it ready for him 
to make the tripHe looked at his watch and saw 
he had no more than half an hour 
until Eb's garage would open and 
half an hour was not worth his 
while to spend in writing. 

HE picked up the paper and 
went out on the porch to 
read the morning's news. 

He thought about little Jane 
and what a sweet kid she was 
and how she'd praised his cooking and chattered on and on. 

"You aren't married," Jane had 
said. "Why aren't you married, 
Mr. Vickers?" 

And he had said, "Once there 
was a girl. I remember now. Once 
there was a girl." 

Her name had been Kathleen 
Preston and she had lived in a 
big brick house that sat up on a 
hill, a many-columned house with 
a wide porch and fanlights above 
the doors — an old house that had 
been built in the first flush of 
pioneer optimism, when the country had been new. The house had 
still stood when the land had failed and washed away in ditches 
and left the hillsides scarred with 
gullied yellow clay. 

He had been young then, so 
young that it hurt him now to 
think of it; so young he could not 



8 




 



understand that a girl who lived 
in an ancestral home with fanlights above the doors and a pillared portico could not seriously 
consider a boy whose father farmed a wornout farm where the 
corn grew slight and sickly. Or 
rather, perhaps, it had been her 
family that could not consider it, 
for she also must have been too 
young to fully understand. Perhaps she had quarreled with her 
family; perhaps there had been 
angry words and tears. That was 
something he had never known. 
For between that walk down the 
enchanted valley and the next 
time he had called, they had bundled her off to a school somewhere in the East and that was 
the last he had seen or heard 
of her. 

For remembrance sake, he had 
walked the valley again, alert to 
catch something that would spell 
out for him the enchantment of 
that day he had been with her. 
But the crab apples had dropped 
their blossoms and the lark did 
not sing so well and the enchantment had fled into some nevernever land. She had taken the 
magic with her. 

The paper fell out of his lap 
and he bent to pick it up. Opening it, he saw that the news was 
following the same drab pattern 
of all other days. 

The latest peace rumor still was 
going strong and the cold war 



still was boiling like dry ice on a 
hot fire. 

The cold war had been going 
on for years, of course, with crisis 
after crisis, rumor after rumor, 
near war always threatening and 
big war never breaking out, until 
a cold-war-weary world yawned 
in the face of the new peace rumors and the crises that were a 
dime a dozen. 

Someone at an obscure college 
down in Georgia had set a new 
record at raw egg-gulping and a 
glamorous movie star was on the 
verge of changing husbands once 
again and the steelworkers were 
threatening to strike. 

rFiHERE was a lengthy feature 
article about missing persons 
and he read about half of it, all 
that he wanted to. It seemed that 
people were constantly dropping 
out of sight, whole families at a 
time, and the police throughout 
the land were getting rather frantic. 

There always had been people 
who had disappeared, the article 
said, but they had been individuals. Now two or three families 
would disappear from the same 
community and two or three from 
another community and there was 
no trace of them at all. Usually 
they were from the poorer brackets. Where individuals had dropped from sight, there had been 
some reason for it, but in these 



SING AROUND THE SUN 



cases of mass disappearances 
there seemed to be no reason beyond poverty and why one would 
or could disappear because of 
poverty was something the article 
writer and the people he had interviewed could not figure out. 

There was a headline that read : 
More Worlds Than One, Says 
Savant. 

He read part of the story: 

BOSTON, MASS. <AP) — There 
may be another Earth just a second 
ahead of us and another world a 
second behind us and another world 
a second behind that one and another world a second behind ■ . . 
wet I, you get the idea. 

A tort of continuous chain of 
worlds, one behind the other. 

That is the theory of Dr. Vincent 
Aldridge. ... 

Vickers let the paper drop to 
the *floor and sat looking out 
across the garden. There was 
peace here, in this garden corner 
of the world, if there were nowhere else. A peace compounded 
of many things, of golden sunshine and the talk of summer 
leaves quivering in the wind, of 
bird and flower and sun dial, of 
picket fence that needed painting and an old pine tree dying 
quietly and tranquilly, taking its 
time to die, being friends with 
the grass and flowers and other 
trees all the while it died. 

Here there was no rumor and 
no threat; here was calm acceptance of the fact that time ran on, 
that winter came and summer, 



that Sun would follow Moon and 
that the life one held was a gift 
to be cherished rather than a 
right that one must wrest from 
other living things. 

Vickers glanced at his watch 
and saw that it was time to go. 

Ill 

EB, the garage man, hitched up 
his greasy britches and 
squinted his eyes against the 
smoke from the cigarette that 
hung from one corner of his 
grease-smeared mouth. 

"You see, it's this way, Jay," 
he explained. "I didn't fix your 
car." 

"I was going to the city," said 
Vickers, "but if my car's not 
fixed . . ." 

"You won't be needing that 
car any more. Guess that's really 
why I didn't fix it. Told myself 
it would be just a waste of 
money." 

"It's not that bad." protested 
Vickers. 

"Sure, it's got lots of miles in it. 
But you're going to be buying 
this new Forever car." 

"Forever car? That's a queer 
name for a car." 

"No, it isn't," Eb told him, 
stubbornly. "It'll really last forever. That's why they call it the 
Forever car, because it lasts forever. Fellow was in here yesterday 
and told me about it and asked 



10 




 



if I wanted to take it on and I 
said sure I would and this fellow, 
he said I was smart to take it on, 
because, he said, there isn't going 
to be any other car selling except 
this Forever car.'* 

"Now wait a minute," said 
Vickers. "They may call it a Forever car, but that doesn't mean 
it'll last forever. -No car would. 
Twenty years, maybe, or a lifetime, but not forever." 

"That's what this fellow told 
me. 'Buy one of them,' he says, 
'and use it all your life. When you 
die, will it to your son and when 
he dies, he can will it to his son, 
and so on down the line.' It's 
guaranteed to last forever. Anything goes wrong with it, they'll 
fix it up or give you a new one. 
All except the tires. They wear 
out, just like on any other car. 
And paint, too. But the paint is 
guaranteed ten years. If it goes 
bad sooner than ten years, you 
get a new job free." 

"I don't doubt a car could be 
made to last longer than the ones 
do now. But if they were built too 
well there'd be no replacement. 
It stands to reason a manufacturer in his right mind wouldn't 
build a car that would last forever. He'd put himself out of 
business. In the first place, it 
would cost too much . . ." 

"That's where you're wrong," 
Eb told him. "You get it complete for fifteen hundred." 



"Not much to look at, I suppose." 

"It's the classiest job you ever 
laid your eyes on. Fellow that was 
here was driving one of them and 
I looked it over good. Any color 
you want. Lots of chrome and 
stainless steel. All the latest gadgets. And drive? Man, that thing 
drives like a million dollars. But 
it might take some getting used 
to it. I want to open the hood 
to take a look at the motor and, 
you know, that hood doesn't 
open. 'What you doing there?' 
this fellow asked and I told him 
I wanted to look at the motor. 
'There isn't any need to,' this fellow says. 'Nothing ever goes 
wrong with it. You never need 
to get at it.' 'But,' I asked him, 
'where do you put in the oil?' 
And you know what he said? 
Well, sir, he said you don't put in 
no oil. 'All you put in is gasoline,' he tells me. 

"I'll have a dozen or so of them 
in within a day or so. Jay," said 
Eb. "You better let me save you 
one." 




"I'm short on money." 



"That's another thing about it. 
This company gives you good 
trade-in value. I figure I could 
give you a thousand for that 
wreck of yours." 

"It's not worth a thousand, 
Eb." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



1 1 



"I know it's not. Fellow says, 
'Give them more than they're 
worth. Don't worry about what 
you give them. We'll make it 
right with you.' It doesn't exactly 
seem the smart way to do business, but if that's the way they 
want to operate, I won't say a 
word against it." 

"I'd have to think about it." 

"That would leave five hundred for you to pay. I can make 
it easy on you. Fellow said I 
should make it easy. Says they 
aren't so much interested in the 
money right now as getting a few 
of them Forever cars out, running 
on the road." 

"I don't like the sound of it," 
objected Vickers. "Here this company springs up overnight with no 
announcement at all with a 
brand-new car. You'd think there 
would have been something in 
the papers about it. If I were 
putting out a new car, I'd plaster 
the country with advertising . . . 
big ads in the newspapers, announcements on television, billboards every mile or so." 

■"Well, you know," said Eb, "I 
thought of that one, too. T said, 
'Look, you fellows want me to sell 
this car and how am I going to 
sell it when you aren't advertising it? How am I going to sell it 
when no one knows about it?' 
And he said that they figured the 
car was so good everyone would 
up and tell everybody else. Said 



there isn't any advertising that 
can beat word of mouth. Said 
they'd rather save the money for 
advertising to cut down the cost 
of the car." 

"I can't understand it." 

"It does sort of hit you that 
way," Eb admitted. "This gang 
that's putting out the Forever car 
isn't losing any money on it, you 
can bet your boots on that. Be 
crazy if they did. And if they 
aren't losing any money at it, 
can you imagine what the rest of 
them companies have been making all these years — two or three 
thousand for a pile of junk that 
falls apart second time you take 
it out?" 

"When you get the cars in," 
said VickerS, "I'll be down to 
take a look at them. We might 
make a deal." 

"Sure. You say you was going 
to the city?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"Be a bus along any minute 
now," said Eb. "Catch it down at 
the drugstore corner. Get you 
there in a couple of hours. Those 
fellows really wheel it." 

"I guess I could take a bus. I 
never thought of it." 

"I'm sorry about the car." said 
Eb. "If I'd known you was going 
to use it, I'd have fixed her up. 
Not much wrong with it. But I 
wanted to see what you thought 
about this other deal before I 
run you up a bill." 



12 




 



THE drugstore corner looked 
somehow unfamiliar and Vickers puzzled about it as he walked 
down the street toward it. Then, 
when he got closer, he saw what 
it was that was unfamiliar. 

Several weeks ago old Hans, 
the shoe repairman, had taken to 
his bed and died and the shoe repair shop, which had stood next 
to the drugstore for almost uncounted years, finally had been 
closed. 

Now it was open again — or, at 
least, the display window had 
been washed, something which 
old Hans in all his years had 
never bothered to do, and there 
was a display of some sort. 

And there was a sign. Vickers 
had been so intent in figuring out 
what was wrong with the finally 
washed window that he did not 
see the sign until he was almost 
even with the store. The sign was 
new and neatly lettered and it 
said GADGET SHOP. 

Vickers stopped before the window and looked at what was inside. A strip of black velvet had 
been laid along the display strip 
and displayed upon it were three 
items — a cigarette lighter, a razor 
blade and a single light bulb. 
Nothing else. 

Just those three items. There 
were no signs, no advertising, no 
prices. There was no need of any. 
Anyone who saw that window, 
Vickers knew, would recognize 



the items, although the store 
would not sell only those. There 
would be a couple of dozen others, each of them in its own way 
as distinguished and efficient as 
the three lying on the strip of 
velvet. 

There was a tapping sound 
along the walk and Vickers turned when it came close to him. It 
was his neighbor, Horton Flanders, out for his morning walk, 
with his slightly shabby, carefully 
brushed clothes and his smart 
malacca cane. No one else, Vickers told himself, would have the 
temerity to carry a . cane along 
the streets of Cliffwood. 

Mr. Flanders saluted him with 
the cane and moved in to stand 
beside him and stare at the window. 

"So they're branching out," he 
said. 

"Apparently," Vickers agreed. 

"Peculiar outfit," said Mr. 
Flanders. "You may know, although I presume you don't, that 
I have been most interested in 
this company. Just a matter of 
curiosity, you understand. I am 
curious, I might add, about many 
different things." 

"I hadn't noticed." 

"Oh, my, yes. About many 
things. About the carbohydrates, 
for instance. Most intriguing setup, don't you think so, Mr. Vickers?" 

"I hadn't given it much

thought. I have been so busy that 
I'm afraid — '* 

"There's something going on," 
said Mr. Flanders. "The question 
is what and why." 

The bus came down the street, 
passed them and braked to a stop 
at the drugstore corner. 

"I'm afraid I'll have to leave 
you," Vickers said- "I'm going to 
the city. If I'm back tonight, why 
don't you drop over?" 

"Oh, I will," Mr. Flanders told 
him. "I nearly always do." 

IV 

IT had been the blade at first, 
the razor blade that would not 
wear out. And after that the 
lighter that never failed to light, 
that required no flints and never 
needed filling. -Then the light bulb 
that would burn forever if it met 
no accident. Now it was the Forever car and the synthetic carbohydrates. 

"There is something going on," 
Mr. Flanders had said to him, 
standing there in front of old 
Hans' shop. "The question is 
what and why." 

Vickers sat in his seat next to 
the window, well back in the bus. 

There was a tie-up somewhere, 
a common denominator to explain why it should be these five 
items and not five other things, 
say roller curtains and pogo sticks 
and yoyos and airplanes and 



toothpaste. Razor blades shaved 
a man and light bulbs lit his way 
and a cigarette lighter would light 
a cigarette and the synthetic carbohydrates had ironed out at 
least one international crisis and 
saved some millions of people 
from starvation or, war. 

"There is something going on," 
Flanders had said, standing there 
in neat, shabby clothes and with 
that ridiculous stick clutched in 
his fist, although, come to think 
of it, it was not ridiculous when 
Mr. Flanders held it. 

The Forever car used no oil 
and when you died you willed it 
to your son, and when he died 
he willed it to his son, and if your 
great-great-grandfather bought 
one of the cars and you were the 
eldest son of the eldest son of the 
eldest son, you would have it, too. 
For the car would last forever. 

But it would do more than that. 
It would close every automotive 
plant in the matter of a year or 
so. It would shut down most 
of the garages and repair shops. 
It would be a blow to the steel 
industry and the glass industry 
and the fabric makers and many 
other industries. 

The razor blade hadn't seemed 
important, nor the light bulb, 
nor the lighter, but now they suddenly were. Thousands of men 
would lose their jobs and they 
would come home and face the 
family and say: "Well ."this is it. 



14 




 



After all these years I haven't 
got a job." 

The family would go about 
their everyday affairs in tight and 
terrible silence, with a queer air 
of dread hanging over them, and 
the man would buy newspapers, 
all the newspapers that there 
were, and would study the want 
ad columns, then go out and walk 
the streets and men in little cages 
or at desks in outer offices would 
shake their heads at him. 

TjMNALLY the man would go to 
one of those little places that 
had the sign "Carbohydrates, 
Inc." over its door and he would 
shuffle in embarrassment, the 
humiliation of a good workman 
who cannot find a job, and he 
would say, "I'm a little down on 
my luck and the cash is running 
low. I wonder — " 

The man behind the desk 
would say, "Why, sure, how many 
in your family?" The man would 
tell him and the one who was at 
the desk would write on a slip 
of paper and hand it to him. 
"That window over there," he'd 
say. "I figure that's enough to last 
you for a week, but if it isn't, be 
sure to come back any time you 
want to." 

The man would take the slip 
of paper and try to say his thanks, 
but the carbohydrates man would 
brush them easily aside and say, 
"That's what we're here for — 



helping guys like you." 

The man would go to the window and the man behind the 
window would look at the slip of 
paper and hand him packages 
and one package would be synthetic stuff that tasted like potatoes and another one would 
taste like bread and there would 
be others that would make you 
think you were eating corn or 
peas. 

It wasn't like relief — anyhow, 
you could say it wasn't. These 
carbohydrates people didn't insult 
you when you came to ask for 
help. They treated you like a paying customer and they always 
said that you should come back 
and sometimes when you didn't 
they came around to see what 
had happened — if maybe you had 
got a job or were bashful about 
coming in again. If it turned out 
that you were bashful, they'd sit 
down and talk and before they 
left they had you thinking you 
were doing them a favor by taking the carbohydrates off their 
hands. 

Because of the carbohydrates, 
millions who would have died 
were still alive in India and in 
China. Because of carbohydrates, 
almost every relief office throughout the entire world had been 
forced to close its doors. People 
wouldn't go to a relief office to 
be bullied and humiliated when 
they could go across the street 



RING AROUND THE SUN

and get food from folks who 
seemed downright glad to t see 
them. 

Now the thousands who would 
lose their jobs would travel the 
same trail to the door with the 
carbohydrates sign. 

The automotive industry would 
have to shut down. Why buy arty 
other car when you could walk 
down the street and get one that 
would last forever? Just as the 
razor blade industry had closed 
its doors when it was possible 
to buy an everlasting blade at the 
gadget shops. The same thing 
had happened with light bulbs 
and with cigarette lighters and 
the chances were, Vickers told 
himself, that the Forever car 
wasn't the last that would be 
heard from these manufacturers, 
whoever they might be. 

Those who made the razor 
blades also must have made the 
lighters and the light bulbs,, and 
those who made the gadget items 
must have designed the Forever 
car. Not the same companies, perhaps, although he couldn't know, 
for it had never occurred to him 
before to try to find out. 

T^HE bus was filling up, but 
Vickers still sat by himself, 
staring out the window and sorting out his thoughts. 

A couple of women behind him 
were talking and, without consciously trying to eavesdrop, he 



heard what they were saying. 

One of them giggled and said, 
"We have the most interesting 
group. So many interesting people in it." 

And the other woman said, "I 
been thinking about joining one 
of those groups, but Charlie says ' 
it's all baloney. Says we're living 
in America in the year 1977 and 
there's no reason in the world 
why we should pretend we aren't. 
Says this is the best country and 
the best time the world has ever 
known. Says we got all the modern conveniences and everything. 
Says we're happier than people 
ever been before. Says this pretending business is just a lot of 
communist propaganda and he'd 
like to get hold of the ones that 
got it started. Says . . ." 

"Oh, I don't know," interrupted the first woman. "It is kind of 
fun. It takes a lot of work, of 
course, reading about them old 
times and all of that, but one 
fellow was saying at a meeting 
the other night you get out of it 
what you put into it and I guess 
he's right. But I don't seem to 
be able to put much into it. I 
must be the flighty type. I'm not 
too good a reader and I don't 
understand too well and I got to 
have a lot explained to me, but 
there are them who get a lot out 
of it, seems like. There's a man 
in our group that is living back 
in London, back in the times of 



16 




 



a man named Peeps. I don't know 
who this Peeps was, but I guess 
he was an important man or 
something. You don't know who 
Peeps was, do you, Gladys?" 

"Not me," said Gladys, 

"Well, anyhow, this fellow talks 
all the time about this Peeps. 
He wrote a book, this Peeps, and 
it must be an awful long book 
because he tells about so many 
things. This man I was telling 
you about writes the most wonderful diary. We always like to 
have him read it to us. You know, 
it sounds almost as if he was 
really living there." 

The bus stopped for a railroad 
crossing and Vickers glanced at 
his watch.* They'd be in the city 
in another half an hour. 

It was a waste of time, he told 
himself. No matter what sort of 
scheme Ann had up her sleeve, it 
would be a waste of time, for he 
was not going to allow anything 
to interrupt his writing. He 
shouldn't have allowed himself 
to be talked into wasting even 
this one day. 

Back of him, Gladys was saying, "Did you hear about these 
new houses they are putting out? 
I was talking to Charlie about 
them the other night and I was 
saying maybe we ought to look 
into them. Our place is getting 
kind of shabby, you know, and we 
will have to paint it and sort of fix 
it up, but Charlie said no one 



would put out them kind of 
houses on the sort of deal they 
offer without there was a catch 
somewhere. Mabel, have you seen 
any of them houses or read anything about them?" 

"I was telling you," Mabel said, 
"about this group I belong to. 
One of the fellows is pretending 
that he's living in the future. 
Now, I ask you, ain't that a 
laugh? Imagine anyone pretending he's living in the future . . ," 

V 

OUTSIDE the door, Ann Carter stopped and said, "Please 
remember Jay, his name is Crawford. You're not to call him Cranford or Crawham or any other 
name but Crawford." 

Vickers said humbly, "I'll do 
my very best." 

She came close to him and 
tightened his tie and straightened 
it and nicked some imaginary 
dust off his lapel. 

"We're going out as soon as 
this is over and buy you a suit," 
she said. 

"I have a suit." 

"Why don't you wear it, then?" 

"Why, I am," said Vickers. 

The letters on the door said 
"North American Research." 

"What I can't understand," 
protested Vickers, "is why North 
American Research and I should 
have anything in common."

"Money," said Ann. "They 
have it and you need it." 

She opened the door and he 
followed her in obediently, thinking what a pretty woman she was 
and how efficient. Too efficient. 
She knew books and publishers 
and what the public wanted and 
she was onto all the angles. She 
drove herself and everyone 
around her. She was never so 
happy as when three telephones 
were ringing and there were five 
dozen letters to be answered and 
a dozen calls to make. She had 
bullied him into coming here and 
it was not beyond reason, he told 
himself, that she had bullied 
Crawford and North American 
Research into wanting him to 
come. 

"Miss Carter," said the girl at 
the de^k, "you can go right in. 
Mr. Crawford is waiting for you." 

She's even got the Indian sign 
on the receptionist, Vickers 
thought. 

VI 

p EORGE CRAWFORD was a 

big man who overflowed the 
chair in which he sat. He held 
his hands folded over his paunch 
and talked with no change of 
tone, with no inflection whatsoever, and was the stillest man 
Vickers had ever seen. He sat 
huge and stolid and his lips 
scarcely moved and his voice was 



not much louder than a whisper. 

"I have read some of your 
work, Mr. Vickers," he said. "I 
am impressed by it." 

"I am glad to hear you say so," 
Vickers said. 

"Three years ago, I never 
would have thought that I would 
ever read a piece of fiction or be 
talking to its author. Now, however, I find that we need a man 
like you. I have talked it over 
with my directors and we are 
all agreed that you are the man 
who could do the job for -us." 

He paused and stared at Vickers with bright blue eyes that 
peered out like bullet points from 
the folds of flesh. 

"Miss Carter," he %aid, "tells 
me that, at the moment, you are 
very busy." 

"That is right," said Vickers. 

"Some important piece of work, 
I presume." 

"I hope it is." 

"This thing I have in mind 
would be much more important." 

"That," Vickers told him crisply, "is a matter of opinion." 

"Before we go any further, I 
would like it understood that 
what I have to say is of a confidential nature." 

"Mr. Crawford, I have little 
stomach for cloak and dagger 
business." 

"This is not cloak and dagger 
business," said Crawford and for 
the first time there was emotion 




 



in his low, quiet voice. "It is the 
business of a world with its back 
against the wall. You have heard 
of the Forever car?" 

VICKERS nodded. "The garage 
owner in my home town tried 
to sell me one this morning." 

"And the everlasting razor 
blades and the lighter and the 
light bulbs?" 

"I have one of the blades." said 
Vickers, "a*d it is the best I 
ever owned. I doubt that it is 
everlasting, but it is a good blade 
and I've never had to sharpen it. 
When it wears out, I intend to 
buy another one." 

"Unless you lose it, you will 
never have to. Because, Mr. 
Vickers, it is an everlasting blade. 
And the car is an everlasting car. 
Maybe you've heard about the 
houses, too." 

"Not enough to matter." 
"The houses are prefabricated 
units," said Crawford, "and they 
sell at the flat rate of five hundred 
dollars a room — set up. You can 
trade in your old home on them 
at a fantastic trade-in value and 
the credit terms are liberal — 
much more liberal, I might add, 
than any sane financing institution would ever allow. They are 
heated and air-conditioned by a 
solar plant that tops anything — 
you hear me, anything — that we 
have today. There are many other features, but that gives you 



something of a rough idea." 

"They sound good. We've been 
talking about low-cost housing 
for a long time now. Maybe 
this is it." 

"They are a good idea," admitted Crawford. "I would be 
the last to deny they are. Except 
that they will ruin the power 
people. The solar plant supplies 
it all — heat, light, power. They 
will put thousands of carpenters 
and masons and painters out of 
work and on the carbohydrates 
lines. They eventually will wreck 
the lumber industry." 

"I can understand about the 
power angle, but that business 
about the carpenters and the lumber industry doesn't quite make 
sense. Surely these houses use 
lumber and it must take carpenters to build them." 

"They use lumber, all right, 
and someone builds them, but we 
don't know who it is." 

"You could check," suggested 
Vickers. "There must be a corporate setup. There must be mills 
and factories somewhere." 

? fTHHERE'S a company," said ■ 

Crawford. "A sales company. We started with that and 
we found the warehouse from 
which the houses are shipped 
after they are sold. But that's the 
end of it. There is, so far as we 
can find, no factory that builds 
them. They are consigned from a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



certain company and we have its 
name and address. But no one has 
ever sold a stick of timber to 
that company. They have never 
bought a hinge. They hire no 
men. They list factory sites and 
the sites are there, but there aren't 
any factories. And, to the best of 
our knowledge, no single person 
has gone into or come out of the 
home office address since we've 
been watching it." 

"That's fantastic," Vickers objected. 

"Of course it is," agreed Crawford. "Lumber and other materials go into those houses and 
somewhere there must be men 
who build them." 

"Mr. Crawford, why are you 
interested?" 

"Well, now, I wasn't quite 
readj^to tell you that." 

"I know you weren't," said 
Vickers, "but you'll tell me anyway." 

"I had hoped to sketch in a bit 
more of the background so you 
would understand what I am 
driving at. Our interest — I might 
say our organization — sounds just 
a little silly until you know the 
background." 

"Someone has you scared. You 
wouldn't admit it, of course, but 
you're scared livid." 

"Queerly enough, I will admit 
it. But it's not me, Mr. Vickers — 
if s industry, the industry of the 
entire world." 



"You think the people who are 
making and selling these houses," 
asked Vickers, "are the same ones 
who are making the Forever car 
and the lighters and the bulbs?" 

Crawford nodded. "And the 
carbohydrates, too." 

"Of course." 

"It's terrifying," Crawford said, 
"when you think about it. Here 
we have someone who wrecks industries and throws millions out 
of work, then turns around and 
offers those same millions the 
food to live on." 

"A political plot?" 

"We are convinced that it is a 
planned attack on world economy 
— a deliberate .effort to undermine the social and economic system of our way of life, and after 
that, of course, the political system. Our way of life is based on 
capital, be it private capital or 
state control of resources and on 
the wage that the worker earns 
at his daily job. Take away those 
two things, capital and jobs, and 
you have undercut the whole 
basis of an orderly society." 

"We?" asked Vickers. "Who 
are we?" 

"North American Research." 

"And North American Research?" 

"You're getting interested," 
said Crawford. 

"I want to know who I'm talking to and what you want of me 
and what it's all about."

/CRAWFORD sat for a long 
^time without speaking, and 
then he finally said, "That is what 
I meant when I told you what 
I had to say was highly confidential." 

"I will swear no oath." said 
Vickers, "if that is what you 
mean." 

"Let's go back and review some 
history. Who we are and what we 
are will become apparent then. 

"You remember the razor 
blade. It was the first to come out. 
An everlasting razor blade. The 
news spread quickly and everyone went out and bought one. 
Now the ordinary man will get 
anywhere from one to half a 
dozen shaves out of a blade. 
Then he throws it away and puts 
in another. That means he is a 
continuous buyer of razor blades. 
As a result, the razor blade industry employed thousands of 
workers, it represented a certain 
profit for thousands of dealers, 
it was a buyer of steel. In other 
words, it was an economic factor 
which, linked with thousands of 
others, make up the picture of 
world industry. So what happens?" 

"I can tell you that," said Vickers, "although I'm no economist. 
No one bought any more razor 
blades. The razor blade industry 
was out the window." 

"Then there was the lighter. A 
small thing in itself, of course, 



but fairly large when you look 
at it from the world point of 
view. The same thing happened 
there. And the everlasting light 
bulbs. Three industries gone. Mr. 
Vickers. Three industries wiped 
out. You said a while ago that I 
was scared and I told you that I 
was. It was after the bulbs that 
we got scared. Because if someone could wipe out three industries, why not half a dozen, a 
dozen, a hundred — why not all 
of them? 

"We organized, and by we I 
mean the industry of the world — 
not American industry alone, but 
the industry of America and the 
British commonwealth and the 
continent of Europe and Russia 
and all of the rest of them. There 
were a few, of course, who were 
skeptical. There still are a few 
who never have come in, but by 
and large I can tell you that our 
organization represents and is 
backed by every major industry 
of the entire world. I would prefer you not to mention this." 

"At the moment," Vickers told 
him, "I have no intention of saying anything about it." 

"We organized," said Crawford, 
"and we swung a lot of power, as 
you can well imagine. We made 
certain representations and we 
brought certain pressures and we 
got a few things done. For one 
thing, no newspaper, no periodical, no radio station now will ac

cept advertising for any of the 
gadgets or give them any mention 
in the news. For another, no 
reputable drugstore or any other 
place of business will sell a razor 
blade or a bulb or lighter." 

"That was when they set up the 
gadget shops?" 

"Exactly," said Crawford. 

"They're branching out," said 
Vickers. "One opened in Cliff wood just the other day." 

WT*HEY set up the gadget 

-■- shops," said Crawford, "and 
they developed a new form of advertising. They hired thousands 
of men and women who went 
around from place to place and 
said to people they would meet, 
'Did you hear about those wonderfu^new gadgets they are getting out? You haven't? Well, just 
let me tell you . . .' That is the 
best kind of advertising there is. 
But it's more expensive than you 
can possibly imagine. 

"So we knew that we were up 
against not merely inventive and 
productive genius, but almost unlimited money as well. 

"And we investigated. We tried 
to find out who they were and 
how they operated and what they 
meant to do. As I've told you, 
we ran into stone walls." 

"There might be legal angles," 
said Vickers. 

"We have run down the legal 
angles. These people, whoever 



they may be, are covered from 
hell to breakfast. Taxes? So there 
won't be any investigation, they 
actually pay more taxes than they 
need to pay. Rules of corporation? They are more than meticulous in meeting all the rules. Social security? They pay it on 
huge payrolls that we are convinced are utterly fictitious, but 
you can't go to the social security 
people and say, 'Look, there 
aren't any such people as these 
they're paying for.' There are 
other points, but those serve as 
illustrations. We've run down so 
many legal blind alleys that our 
legal force is dizzy." 

"Mr. Crawford," said Vickers, 
"you make out a most interesting 
case, but I can't see the point of 
what you said earlier. You said 
this was a conspiracy to break 
world industry. If you study your 
economic history, you will find 
example on example of cutthroat 
competition. That's all this is." 

"You forget," Crawford replied, 
"about the carbohydrates." 

A ND that was true, thought 
Vickers. The carbohydrates 
had no place in mere cutthroat 
competition. 

"We checked into them," Crawford said. "So far as we're concerned, the carbohydrates aren't 
being manufactured — they simply 
exist. They are shipped to the distribution offices from several 




 



warehouses and none of the warehouses are big enough to carry 
more than a day or two's supply. 
We can find no factories and we 
can't trace transportation — oh, 
sure, from the warehouses to thedistribution points, but not from 
anywhere to the warehouses. It's 
like the old story that Hawthorne told about the pitcher of 
milk that never ran dry." 

"What happens when the men 
who are out of work need more 
than just a gift of food?" asked 
Vickers. "What happens when 
their families are in tatters and 
they need clothes and they're 
thrown out into the street?" 

"I think I can answer that. 
Some other philanthropic society 
will spring up overnight and will 
furnish clothes and shelter. 
They're selling houses now for 
five hundred a room, which is no 
more than token payment. Why 
not give them away? Why not 
clothing that will cost no more 
than a tenth or a twentieth of 
what you pay today. A suit for 
five dollars, say, or a dress for 
fifty cents." 

"You have no idea of what is 
coming next?" 

"We've tried to dope it out," 
said Crawford. "We figured the 
car would come quickly, and it 
did. We figured houses, too, and 
they have put them out. Clothing 
should be one of the next items 
to go on the market." 



"Food, shelter, transportation, 
clothing," said Vickers. "Those 
are four basics." 

"They also have fuel and power," Crawford added. 

"But who is it? You've told me 
you don't know, but you must 
have some idea, some educated 
guess." 

"Not an inkling. We have tables 
of organization for their corporation setups. We can't find the 
men themselves; they are names 
we've never heard of." 

"Russia?" 

Crawford shook his head. "Russia is cooperating. That should 
prove how scared they are." 

For the first time, Crawford 
moved. He unfolded his hands 
from across his paunch, grasped 
the arms of his massive chair and 
pulled himself straight, sitting 
upright now. 

"I suppose," he said, "that you 
are wondering where you fit in 
on this." 

"Naturally." 

"We can't say, 'here we are, a 
combine of the world's industrial 
might, fighting to protect your 
way of life.' We can't explain 
to the people what the situation 
is. They'd laugh at us. After all, 
you can't tell them that a car 
that will last forever or a house 
that costs only five hundred a 
room is a bad thing for them. We

this needs telling. We want you

to write a book about it." 

"I don't see . . ." said Vickers, 
but Crawford stopped him in 
mid -sentence. 

"You would write it as if you 
had doped it out yourself. You 
would hint at informed sources 
that were too high to name. We'd 
furnish all the data, but the material would appear as yours." 

Vickers came slowly to his 
feet. He reached out a hand and 
picked up his hat. 

"Thanks for the chance," he 
said. "I'm not having any." 

VII 

INN CARTER said to Vickers: "Someday I'm going to 
get sore enough at you to take 
you apart. And when I do maybe 
I'll have a chance to find what 
makes you tick." 

"I have a book to write," said 
Vickers. "I'm writing it. What

more do you want?" 

"That book could keep. You 
could write it anytime." 

"Go ahead, tell me I threw 
away a million bucks. That's 
what you're thinking." 

"You could have charged them 
a fancy fee for writing and gotten 
a contract with the publisher like 
there never was before . . ." 



"And pushed aside the greatest piece of work I've ever done," 
said Vickers, "and come back to 
it cold and find I'd lost the feel." 

"Every book you write is your 
greatest one. You're nothing but 
a literary ham. Sure, you do good 
work and your darn books sell, 
although sometimes I wonder 
why, but if there were no money 




RING AROUND THE SUN 



25 



in it, you'd never write another 
word. Tell me, honest, why do 
you write?" 

"You've answered it for me. 
You say it is for money. All 
right, so it is for money." 

"All right, so I have a sordid 
soul." 

"My God, we're fighting as if 
we're married!" 

"That's another thing. You've 
never married, Jay. It's an index 
of your selfishness. I bet you 
never even thought of it." 

"Once I did," said Vickers. 
"Once long ago." 

"Here, put your head down 
here and have a good long cry. 
I bet it was pitiful. I bet that's 
how you get some of those excruciating love scenes you put into y«ur books." 

"Ann, you're getting maudlin 
drunk." 

"If I'm getting drunk, you're 
the man who drove me to it. 
Thanks for the chance, but I'm 
not having any." 

"I had a hunch there was something phony there," insisted Vickers. 

"That was you," Ann retorted. 

She finished off her drink. 

"Don't use a hunch," she said, 
"to duck the responsibility of 
turning down the best thing you 
ever had. Anytime someone dangles money like that in front of 
me, I'm not letting any hunch 
stand in my way." 



"I'm sure you wouldn't," Vickers agreed. 

"That was a nasty thing to 
say," Ann told him. "Pay for the 
drinks and let's get out of here. 
I'm putting you on that bus and 
don't you come back here again." 

VIII 

THE huge sign was draped diagonally across the front of 
the huge show window. It read: 

HOUSES 
TAILORED TO ORDER 
$500 a room 
LIBERAL TRADE-IN 
ON YOUR OLD HOME 

In the window was a five or 
six room house, set in the middle 
of a small, beautifully planned 
lawn and garden. There was a 
sun dial in the garden and a cupola with a flying duck weather 
vane on the attached garage. Two 
white lawn chairs and a white 
round table stood on the clipped 
grass and there was a new and 
shiny car standing in the driveway. 

Ann squeezed Vickers' arm. 
"Let's go in." 

"This must be what Crawford 
was talking about," said Vickers. 

"You got lots of time to catch 
the bus and we could have a 
look." 

"We might as well. If you get 




 



interested in looking at a house, 
you won't be chewing me." 

"If I thought it were possible. 
I'd trap and marry you." 

"And make my life a hell." 

"Why, certainly." Ann told him 
sweetly. "Why else would I do 
it?" 

The door swung to behind them 
and the noise of the street was 
shut away and they walked on 
the deep green carpeting that 
doubled as a lawn. 

A salesman saw them and came 
over. 

"We were just passing by," said 
Ann, "and we thought we would 
drop in. It looks like a fine house 
and . . ." 

"It is a fine house," the salesman assured them, "and it has 
many special features." 

"Is that true what the sign 
said?" asked Viekers. "Five hundred dollars a room?" 

"Everyone asks me that. They 
read the sign, but they don't believe it, so the first thing they 
ask me when they come in is 
whether it is really true that we 
sell these houses for five hundred 
a room." 

"Well, is it?" persisted Viekers. 

"Absolutely," said the salesman. "A five room house is 
twenty-five hundred dollars and a 
ten room house would be five 
thousand dollars. Most people, 
of course, aren't interested in a 
ten room house at first." 



"What do you mean, at first?" 

"Well, this is what you might 
call a house that grows. You buy 
a five room house, say, and in a 
little while you figure that you 
want another room, so we come 
out and redesign the house and 
make it a six room house." 

"Isn't that expensive?" Ann 
asked. 

"Oh, not at all," the salesman 
said. "It only costs you five hundred dollars for the extra room. 
That is a flat and standard 
charge." 

"This is a prefabricated house, 
isn't it?" asked Ann. 

"I suppose you could call it 
that, although it does the house 
injustice. When you say 'prefabricated' you are thinking of a 
house that is pre-cut and sort of 
stuck together. Takes a week or 
ten days to put it togethei and 
then you just have a shell — no 
heating plant, no fireplace, nothing." 

"I'm interested in this extra 
room angle," said Viekers. "You 
say that when they want an extra room, they just call you up 
and you come out and stick one 
on." 

HPHE salesman stiffened slightly. 

"We stick nothing on. At all 
times, your house is well planned 
and practical, designed in accordance with the highest scientific 
and esthetic concepts of what a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



77 



home should be. In some cases, 
adding another room means that 
we have to change the whole 
house around, rearrange the 
rooms and such. If you wanted to 
change the place completely, the 
best thing might be to trade the 
house in on a new one. For doing 
that, we make a service charge 
of one per cent per year of the 
original cost, plus, of course, the 
charge for the extra rooms." 

He looked at the two of them 
hopefully. "You have a house, 
perhaps?" 

"A little cottage up the valley," 
said Vickers. "It's not much of 
a place." 

"Worth how much, would you 
say?" 

"Fifteen or twenty thousand, 
but 1^ doubt if I could get that 
much." 

"We'd give you twenty thousand," said the salesman, "subject to appraisal. Our appraisals 
are most liberal." 

"Look," Vickers objected, "I'd 
only want a five or six room 
house. That would come to 
twenty five hundred or three 
thousand." 

"We'd pay the difference in 
cash." 

"It doesn't make sense!" 

"We're willing to pay the going 
market value on existing homes 
in order to introduce our own. In 
your case, we'd pay you the difference, then take your old place 



and move it away and set up the 
new one. It's as simple as that." 

Ann said to Vickers, "Go ahead 
and tell the man that you aren't 
having any. This sounds like a 
good sound business proposition 
to me, so you'll naturally turn it 
down." 

"Madam," said the salesman, 
"I don't quite understand." 

"It's just a private joke," Vickers interpreted. 

"Oh . . . Well, I was telling you 
that this house has some special 
features." 

"Go ahead, please," said Ann. 
"Tell us about them." 

"Very happy to. For instance, 
there is the solar plant. You do 
know what a solar plant is?" 

Vickers nodded. "A power plant 
operated by the Sun." 

"Exactly," said the salesman. 
"This plant, however, is somewhat more efficient than the usual 
solar plant. It not only heats the 
house in winter, but supplies electrical power for the year round. 
It eliminates the necessity of relying upon a public utility for your 
power. I might add there is much 
more than you will ever need." 

"A nice feature," said Ann. 

"Then," continued the salesman, "it comes fully equipped. 
You get a refrigerator and a deep 
freeze, an automatic washer and 
drier, a dish washer, a garbage 
disposal unit, a toaster, a waffle 
iron, radio, television, and other 



28 




 



odds and ends." 

"An extra charge for them, of 
course," said Vickers. 

"Positively not. All you pay is 
five hundred a room." 

"And beds?" asked Ann. 
"Chairs and stuff like that?" 

"I'm sorry," said the salesman. 
"You have to furnish those yourself." 

"There is an extra charge," 
Vickers pushed on, "for carting 
away the old house and putting 
up the new one." 

|~\RAWING himself erect, the 
salesman spoke with quiet 
dignity. "There are no hidden 
costs. You buy the house and pay 
—or arrange to pay — at the rate 
of five hundred a room. We have 
trained crews of workmen who 
move away your old house and 
erect the new one. All of that is 
included in the original cost. 
Some buyers want to change location. In that case we are usually 
able to work out an acceptable 
exchange plan between their old 
real estate and the new location 
they select. You, I presume, 
would want to stay where you 
are. You said you were up the 
valley. A most attractive place." 

"Well, I don't know," said 
Vickers. 

"I forgot to mention one thing," 
the salesman went on. "You never 
have to paint this house. It is 
built of material that is of the 



same color all the way through 
and never wears off or fades. We 
have a wide range of very attractive color combinations." 

"We don't want to take up too 
much of your time," said Vickers. 
"You see, we're not really customers. We just dropped in." 

"But you have a house?" 

"Yes, I have a house." 

"And we stand ready to replace 
it with a new one and pay you a 
comfortable sum besides." 

"I know all that," said Vickers, 
"but . . 

"It seems to me," the salesman 
said, "that you should be trying 
to sell me instead of me trying 
to sell you." 

"I have a house and I like it. 
How would I know I'd like one 
of these new houses?" 

"Why, sir, I've just been telling 
you — " 

"I'm used to my house. I'm acquainted with it and it's got used 
to me. I've become attached to 
it—" 

"Jay Vickers," said Ann, "y° u 
can't become attached to a house 
in only three years. To hear you 
talk about it, one would think 
you'd lived all your life in an old 
ancestral home." 

"I have the feel of it," Vickers 
stated obstinately. "I know the 
place. There is a creaky board 
in the dining room and I step on 
it on purpose at times just to 
hear it creak. And there's a pair 



RING AROUND THE 5UN 



29 



of robins that have a nest in the 
vine on the porch and there's a 
cricket in the basement. I've 
hunted for that cricket, but I 
never could find him; he was too 
smart for me. And now I wouldn't 
touch him if I could, because he 
is a part of the house and — " 

"You'd never be bothered with 
crickets in one of our houses. 
They have bug repellant built 
right into them. You never are 
bothered with mosquitoes or ants 
or crickets or anything of the 
sort." 

BUT I'm not bothered with 
this cricket," said Vickers. 
"That is what I was trying to 
tell you. I like it. I'm not sure I'd 
like a house where .a cricket 
couldn't live. Now, mice, that's 
a littl* different." 

"I dare say," declared the salesman, "that you would riot have 
mice in one of our houses." 

"I won't have any in mine, 
either. I called the exterminator 
and they'll be gone by the time 
I get home." 

"Well, now," the salesman said, 
"there is something else to consider in connection with our 
house. We put them up in one 
day's time. You give us an order 
tonight and by tomorrow night 
you can move in. And if, for some 
reason or other, you move to another city or another part of the 
country, we will undertake to 



move your house for you. With 
our houses there is no need to go 
through the ordeal of selling the 
old house, moving to your new 
location and then spending weeks, 
if not months, hunting for the 
kind of house you want to buy. 
You move your house right along 
with you, like your briefcase or 
your golf clubs. 

"Let's say you aren't moving 
to another city. Maybe you just 
get dissatisfied with the location 
that you have. You want to move 
out to the country or to another 
section of the city. Pick out the 
place you want to go and let us 
know. Give us twenty-four hours 
and we'll move the house for 
you." 

"I suppose," said Ann, "it costs 
a lot to have the house moved." 

"Not at all," the salesman answered. "One per cent of the purchase price, that's all. In the case 
of a five room house, that would 
be twenty -five dollars." 

"But suppose it was clear 
across the country . . ." 

"It makes no difference," said 
the salesman. "We make money 
on some, lose on others. In the 
end, we even out." 

"One thing is bothering me," 
said Ann. "You remember all 
that equipment you mentioned, 
the washer and refrigerator and 
television and . . . ?" 

"Yes, certainly." 

"But you didn't even once 



30 




 



happen to mention a stove." 

"Didn't I ?" asked the salesman. "Now how could I have let 
it slip my mind? Of course you 
get a stove." 

IX 

WHEN the bus reached Cliffwood, darkness was beginning to fall. Vickers bought a 
paper at the corner drugstore and 
made his way across the street to 
the town's one clean cafe. 

He had ordered the meal and 
was just starting on the paper 
when a piping voice hailed him. 
"Hi there, Mr. Vickers." 
Vickers put down the paper 
and looked up. It was Jane, the 
moppet who had come for breakfast. 

"Why, hello, Jane," he said. 
"What are you doing here?'* 

"Me and Mommy came down 
to buy some ice cream for supper," Jane explained. She perched 
herself on the edge of the chair 
across the table from him. 
"Where you been today, Mr. 
Vickers? I came across to see you, 
but there was a man there and 
he wouldn't let me in. He said he 
was killing mice. What Was he 
killing mice for, Mr. Vickers?" 

"Jane," a voice said. 

Vickers looked up and a woman stood there, sleek and maturely beautiful, and she smiled at 
him. 



"You must not mind her. Mr. 
Vickers," she said. 

"I don't. I think she's wonderful." 

"I'm Mrs. Leslie," said the 
woman. "Jane's mother. We've 
been neighbors for a long time 
now, but we've never met." 

She sat down at the table. 

"I've read some of your books," 
she said, "and they are splendid. 
I haven't read them all. One has 
so little time." 

"Thank you, Mrs. Leslie," said 
Vickers, and wondered if she 
would think that he was thanking 
her for not reading all his books. 

"I had meant to come over and 
see you. Some of us are organizing a Pretentionist club and I 
have you on my list." 

Vickers shook his head. "I am 
always pressed for time. I make 
it a rule to belong to no organization." 

"But this," said Mrs. Leslie, 
"would be — well, you might say 
this would be down your alley." 

"I am glad you thought of me." 

She laughed at him. "You 
think us foolish, Mr. Vickers." 

"No," he said, "not foolish." 

"Infantile, then." 

"Since you supplied the word," 
said Vickers, "I must admit it 
doeg seem somewhat infantile." 

NOW, he thought, I've done it. 
She will twist it around so 
that it will appear it was I, not 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



she. who said it. She'll tell all the 
neighbors how I told her to her 
face the club was infantile. 

But she didn't seem insulted. 
"It must seem that way to someone like you who has every minute filled. But I think it might be 
a wonderful way to work up an 
interest — an outside interest, that 
is." 

"I have no doubt of it," said 
Vickers. 

"It's a lot of work, I understand. You decide on the period 
you'd like to pretend you are living in. Then you must read up 
on the period and write your 
diary and it must be a full account of each day's activities and 
not just a sentence or two. You 
must make it interesting and, if 
you can, exciting." 

^There are many periods of 
history that could be made exciting." 

"I'm glad to hear you say 
that," Mrs. Leslie replied eagerly. 
"Would you tell me one? If you 
were going to choose a period for 
excitement, which would you 
choose?" 

"I'm sorry," Vickers said. "I'd 
have to think about it." 

"But I just heard you say there 
were many . . ." 

"I know. And yet, when I think 
of it, the present day might prove 
as exciting as any of the others." 

"But there's nothing going on!" 

"There's too much going on," 



said Vickers. 

The whole idea was pitiful, of 
course — grown people pretending 
they lived in some other age, 
publicly confessing that they 
could not live at peace with their 
own age, but must go burrowing 
back through time to find the 
musty thrill of vicarious existence. It marked some rankling 
failure in the lives of these people, some terrible emptiness that 
would not let them be, some 
screaming vacuum that somehow 
had to be filled. 

TTE remembered the two women who had talked in the 
bus seat behind him and he wondered momentarily what illusory 
satisfaction the Pretentionist living back in Pepys' time might get 
out of it. There was, of course, 
Pepys' well filled life, the scurrying about, the meetings with 
many people, the little taverns 
where there were cheese and wine, 
the theatres, the good companionship and the midnight talks, the 
many interests that had kept 
Pepys as naturally full of life as 
these Pretentionists were empty. 

The movement itself was escapism, obviously, but escapism 
from what? From insecurity, perhaps. From a daily, ever-present 
tension that never quite bubbled 
into fear, yet never quieted into 
peace. The state, perhaps, of 
never being sure — a state of mind 



32 




 



for which all the advantages of a 
highly advanced technology could 
not compensate. 

"They must have our ice cream 
packed by now," said Mrs. Leslie, 
gathering up her gloves and purse. 
"You must come over, Mr. Vickers, and spend an evening with 
us." 

Vickers rose with her. "Some 
evening very soon," he promised. 

He knew he wouldn't and he 
knew she didn't want him to, but 
they both paid lip service to the 
old fable of hospitality. 

"Come along, Jane," said Mrs. 
Leslie. "It was nice to meet you, 
Mr. Vickers, after all these 
years. " 

Without waiting for his answer, 
she moved away. 

"Everything is fine at our house 
now," said Jane. "Mommy and 
Daddy have made up again." 

''I'm glad of that," said Vickers. 

"Daddy says he won't run 
around with women no more." 

"I'm glad to hear that, too." 

Her mother called to her across 
the store. 

"I got to go now," said Jane. 
She slipped off the chair and ran 
to her mother's side. She turned 
and waved at him as they went 
out the door. 

Poor kid, he thought, what a 
life she has ahead of her. If I had 
a little girl like that — he shut the 
thought away. There was no little 



girl for him. There was a shelf of 
books and the manuscript that 
lay waiting for him; not much to 
build a life on. 

That was the trouble with not 
himself alone, but with everyone 
— no one seemed now to have too 
much on which to build a life. 
For years the world had lived 
with war or the threat of war. 
First it had been a frantic feeling, 
a running to escape, and then it 
was just a moral and mental 
numbness that one didn't even 
notice, a condition that one accepted as the normal way of life. 

No wonder there were Pretentionists. With his books and manuscripts, he was one himself. 

HE looked under the flower pot 
in the corner of the stoop to 
find the key, but there was none, 
and then he remembered that he 
had left the house unlocked so 
that Joe could come in and get 
rid of the mice. 

He turned the knob and went 
in and made his way across the 
room to turn on the desk lamp. 
A white square of paper with 
awkward pencil scrawls upon it 
lay underneath the lamp. 

Jay: I did the job, then came back 
and opened up the windows to clean 
out the smell. I'll give you' a hundred 
bucks a throw ior every mouse you 
find. Joe. 

A noise brought him, around 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



33 



from the desk and he saw that 
there was someone on the porch, 
sitting in his favorite chair, rocking back and forth, a cigarette 
making a little wavy line dancing 
in the dark. 

"It's I," said Horton Flanders. 
"Have you had anything to eat?" 

"I grabbed a meal in the village." 

"That's a pity. I brought over 
a tray of sandwiches and some 
beer. I thought you might be 
hungry and I know how you hate 
to cook . . 

"Thanks," said Vickers. "I'm 
not hungry now. We can have 
them later." 

He threw his hat on a chair 
and went out to the porch. 

"I have your chair," said Mr. 
Flanders. 

'^eep it," Vickers said. "This 
one is just as comfortable." 

"Did you notice if there was 
any news today? I have a most 
deplorable habit, at times, of not 
looking at the papers." 

"The same old thing. Another 
peace rumor that no one quite 
believes." 

"Has it ever occurred to you, 
Mr. Vickers, that there have been 
a dozen times at least when there 
should have been real war, but 
somehow or other it has never 
come to be?" 

"I hadn't thought of it." 

"But it's the truth," said Mr. 
Flanders. "First there was the 



Berlin airlift trouble and the 
fighting in Greece. Either one of 
them could have set off a full 
scale war, but each of them was 
settled. Then there was Korea 
and that was settled, too. Iran 
later threatened to blow up the 
world, but we got safely past it. 
Then there were the Manila incidents and the flareup in Alaska 
and the Indian crisis and half a 
dozen 6thers. But all of them 
were settled, one way or another." 

"No one really wants to fight," 
said Vickers. 

"Perhaps not, but it takes more 
than just the desire for peace to 
prevent a war. Time and again 
major nations have climbed so 
far out on a limb that they had 
to fight or back up. They always 
have backed up. That isn't human nature, Mr. Vickers, or at 
least it wasn't human nature until 
thirty years ago. Does it seem to 
you that something might have 
happened, some unknown factor, 
some new equation, that may account for it?" 

"I don't see how there could 
be any new factor. The human 
race is still the human race. It's 
always fought before. Thirty 
years ago it had just finished the 
greatest war that ever had been 
fought." 

"Since then, there has been 
provocation after provocation and 
there have been regional wars, 
but the world has not gone to 



34 




 



war. Can you tell me why?" 
"No, I can't." 

"¥ HAVE thought about it," 
said Mr. Flanders, "in an 
idle way, of course. And it seems 
to me that there must be some 
new factor." 

"Fear, perhaps," suggested 
Vickers. "Fear of our frightful 
weapons." 

"That might be it, but fear is 
a funny thing. It is just as apt to 
start a war as it is to hold one 
off, make a people go out and 
fight to be rid of fear — willing to 
go against the fear itself to be 
rid of it. I don't think, Mr. Vickers, that fear alone can account 
for peace." 

"Then what factor do you 
think it might be?" 

"Intervention," Mr. Flanders 
said. 

"Intervention! Who would intervene?" 

"I really couldn't say. But the 
thought is not a new one to me 
and not in this respect alone. 
Starting about 80 years or so ago, 
something happened to the world. 
Up until that time, Man had 
stumbled along pretty much in 
the same old ruts. There had been 
some progress here and there, 
some changes, but not very many 
of them. Not many changes in 
thinking especially, and that is 
what really counts. 

"Then mankind, which had 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



been shambling along, broke into 
a gallop. The automobile was 
invented and the telephone and 
motion pictures and flying machine. There was the radio and 
all the other gadgetry that characterized the first quarter of the 
century. 

"But that was largely mechan ics, 
putting two and two together and 
having four come out. In the second quarter of the century, classical physics was largely displaced 
by a new kind of thinking, which 
admitted that it didn't know 
when it came face to face with the 
atoms and electrons. And out of 
that came theories and the physics of the atom and all the probabilities that today still are 
probabilities. 

"And that, I think, was the 
greatest stride of all — that the 
physicists who had fashioned neat 
cubicles of knowledge and had 
classified and assigned all the 
classical knowledge to fit into 
them snugly should have had the 
courage to say they didn't know 
what made electrons behave the 
way they do." 

"You're trying to say," Vickers 
put in, "that something happened 
to whip Man out of his rut. But 
it wasn't the first time a thing 
like that had happened. Before it 
there had been the Renaissance 
and the Industrial Revolution." 

"I did not say it was the only 
time it had ever happened." Mr. 

35 



Flanders told him, "I merely said 
it happened. The fact that it had 
happened before, in a slightly different manner, should prove that 
it is not an accident, but some 
sort of cycle, some sort of influence which is operative within 
the human race. What is it that 
kicks a plodding culture out of a 
shuffle into a full-fledged gallop 
and, in this case at least, keeps it 
galloping for almost a hundred 
years without a sign of slackening?" 

"You said intervention. You're 
off on some wild fantasy. Men 
from Mars, maybe?" 

Mr. Flanders shook his head. 
"Let's be a little more general." 
He waved his cigarette at the sky 
above the hedge and trees, with 
its many stars twinkling in the 
night. "Out there must be great 
reservoirs of knowledge. At many 
points in all that space beyond 
our Earth there must be thinking 
beings and they would create 
knowledge that we had never 
dreamed of. Some of it might be 
applicable to humans and to 
Earth and much of it would not." 

"You're suggesting that someone in another solar system — " 

"No," said Mr. Flanders. "I'm 
suggesting that the knowledge is 
there and waiting, waiting for us 
to go out and get it." 

"We haven't even reached the 
Moon yet." 

"We may not need to wait for 



rockets. We might reach out with 
our minds . . ." 
"Telepathy?" 

"Maybe that is the word for 
it. A mind probing out and 
searching — a mind reaching out 
for a mind. If there is such a 
thing as telepathy, distance 
should be no barrier. A half a mile 
or half across the Universe, what 
would be the difference? For the 
mind is not a physical property; 
it is not bound, or should not be 
bound, by the laws that say that 
nothing can exceed the speed of 
light." 

Vickers laughed uneasily, feeling the slow crawl of invisible, 
many-footed creatures moving on 
his neck. 

"You can't be serious," he said. 

"Perhaps I'm not," admitted 
Mr. Flanders. "Perhaps 'I'm an 
old eccentric who has found a 
man who will listen to him and 
will not laugh too much." 

"But this knowledge that you 
talk of. There is no evidence that 
it exists or that it ever could be 
applied. It would be alien. It 
woud involve alien logic and apply to alien problems and it 
would be based on alien concepts 
that we could not understand." 

"Much of it would. There 
would be much chaff, but you 
would find some kernels. You 
might find, for instance, a way in 
which friction could be eliminated 
and if you found that you would 



36 




 



have machines that would last 
forever and you would have — " 

"Wait a minute," snapped 
Vickers, tensely. "What are you 
getting at? What about this business of machines that would run 
forever? We have that already. 
I was talking to Eb just this 
morning and he was telling me — " 

"About a car. That, Mr. Vickers, is one of the things I was 
talking about." 

XI 

¥70R a long time after Mr. 
-1 Flanders left, Vickers sat on 
the porch, smoked his cigarettes 
and stared at the patch of sky he 
could see between the top of the 
hedge and the porch's roof . . . 
at the sky and its crystal wash of 
stars, thinking that one could not 
sense the distance and the time 
that lay between the stars. 

Flanders was an old man with 
a shabby coat and a polished 
stick and a queer, stilted way of 
talking that made you think of 
another era and another culture. 
What could he possibly know of 
knowledge in the stars? 

He had thought of it, he'd said, 
in an idle way. And that, Vickers 
realized, was the way it was — an 
eccentric with nothing on his 
mind except the idle speculations 
that took his mind off an old and 
faded life that he wanted to 
forget. 



And there, thought Vickers, I 
am speculating, too, for there's no 
way that I can know the kind of 
life the old man may have led. 

He got up and went into the 
living room. He pulled the chair 
out from his desk and sat down 
and stared at the typewriter sitting there, accusing him of an 
entire wasted day, pointing silently at the pile of manuscript 
that should have been a little 
thicker if he had stayed at home. 

He picked up a few pages of 
the manuscript and tried to read, 
but he had no interest and he was 
gripped by the terrifying thought 
that he had gone cold. 

He had said no, he wasn't interested in writing Crawford's 
book, and he had said it because 
he wasn't interested. And yet that 
had not been the only factor; 
there had been something else. 
Hunch, he had told Ann, and she 
had scoffed at him. But there had 
been a hunch — that and a feeling 
of danger and of fear, as if a 
second self had been standing at 
his side, warning him away. 

It was illogical, of course, for 
there was no reason why he 
should have had a sense of fear. 
He could have used the money. 
Ann could have used the fee. And 
yet, without an instant's hesitation, he had refused the offer. 

He put the sheets of manuscript back on top of the pile, rose 
from the chair and pushed it flush 



RING AROUND THE SUN

which the sound had come without anything knowing he had 
turned. 

There were no mice. Joe had 
come up, while he was in the city, 
and had killed the mice. There 
should be no scurrying from one 
corner to the next. Joe had left a 
note which even now still lay 
beneath the desk lamp saying 
that he would pay one hundred 
bucks a throw for every mouse 
that Vickers could produce. 

The silence hung, not so much 
a silence as a quietness, as if 
everything was waiting without 
breathing. 

Moving only his eyeballs, for 
it seemed that if he turned his 
head his neck would creak and 
betray him to whatever danger 
there might be, Vickers examined 
the room, the darkened areas in 
the corners and underneath the 
furniture and in the shadowed 
places that were farthest from the 
light. Cautiously he put his hands 
behind him, to grasp the desk 
edge, to get hold of something 
J:hat was solid so that he did hot 
stand so agonizingly alone, transfixed in the room. 

The fingers of his right hand 
touched something that was me 
tallic and he knew it was the 
metal paperweight that he had 
lifted off the pile of manuscrip' 
when he? 4iad>s«t^aow.n at the 
desk!" His fingew reached out and 
grasped lrXfind dragged it for


ward into the hollow of his hand 
and he closed his fingers on it 
and he had a weapon. 

There was something in the 
corner by the yellow chair and 
although it seemed to have no 
eyes, he knew it was watching 
him. It didn't know that he had 
spotted it, or it didn't seem to 
know. 

"Now!" said Vickers. 

His right arm swung up and 
over and followed through and 
the paperweight, turning end for 
end, crashed into the corner. 

There was a crunching sound 
and the noise of metallic parts 
rolling on the floor. 

XII 

THERE were many little tubes, 
smashed, and .*n„ intricate 




RING AROUND THE SUN 



39 



mass of wiring that was bent and 
broken, and crystal disks that 
were chipped and splintered, and 
the metallic outer shell that had 
held the tubes and wiring and the 
disks and the many other pieces 
of mechanical mystery that he 
did not recognize. 

Vickers pulled the desk lamp 
closer to him, so that the light 
might shine down upon the handful of parts he had gathered from 
the floor and he put out a finger 
and stirred it among them, gingerly, listening to the tinkling 
sounds they made as they clinked 
together. 

No mouse, but something else 
— something that scuttled in the 
night, knowing that he would 
think it was a mouse; a thing that 
had scaled the cat which knew 
it was no mouse, and a thing that 
would not be attracted to traps. 

An electronic spy, he speculated, a scuttling, scurrying, listening device that watched his 
every moment, that stored what 
it heard and saw for future reference or transmitted directly the 
knowledge that it gained. But 
direct to whom? And why? If it 
were a spying device, it would be 
made so well, so cleverly that it 
would be able not only to observe him, but to keep out of sight 
itself. To have any value, it must 
keep its presence undetected. 
There would have been no careless moment. It would not have 



been seen unless it wanted itself 
to be seen. 

Untess it wanted itseli to be 
seen! 

He had been sitting at the desk 
and had gotten up and pushed 
the chair flush with the desk and 
it had been then that he had 
heard the scampering. If it had 
not run, he never would have 
seen it. And it need not have run, 
for the room was in shadow, with 
only the desk lamp burning, and 
his back had been toward the 
room. 

The cold certainty came to 
him that it had wanted to be seen, 
that it had wanted to be trapped 
in a corner and crushed with a 
paperweight — that it had run deliberately to call his attention to 
it and that once he'd seen it, it 
had not tried to get away.' 

He sat at the desk and perspiration chilled his forehead. 

It had wanted to be, seen. It 
had wanted him to know. 

Not it, of course, but whoever 
or whatever it was that had 
caused the contraption to be 
placed inside his house. For 
months it had scampered and 
scurried like a mouse, had listened and watched, and now the 
scampering and the watching had 
come to an end and it was time 
for something else; time to serve 
notice on him that he was being 
watched. 

But why and who? 



40 




 



¥TE fought down the cold, 
screaming panic that rose inside of him, forced himself to 
stay sitting in the chair. 

There was a clue somewhere in 
this very day, he thought, if he 
could recognize it. Something 
happened today that made the 
someone behind the watcher decide it was time to let him know. 

He ticked off the day's events, 
marshaling them in his mind as 
they might be written in a notebook: 

The moppet who had come to 
breakfast. 

The remembrance of a walk 
that he had taken twenty years 
before. 

The story in the paper about 
more worlds than one. 

The Forever car. 

The women who had talked in 
the seat behind him on the bus, 
and Mrs. Leslie and the club she 
was organizing. 

Crawford and his story of a 
world with its back against the 
waif. 

The houses at five hundred a 
room. 

Mr. Flanders sitting on the 
porch and saying that there was 
a new-found factor which kept 
the world from war. 

The mouse that was not a 
mouse. 

But that wasn't all, of course; 
somewhere there was something 
else that he had forgotten. With


out knowing how he knew it, he 
was aware that he had forgotten 
some other fact that should be 
inserted in the list of things that 
had happened in the day. 

There was Flanders saying that 
he was interested in the setup of 
the gadget shops and that he was 
intrigued by the riddle of the 
carbohydrates and that he was 
convinced there was something 
going on. 

And later in the day he had sat 
on the porch and talked of reservoirs of knowledge in the stars 
and of a factor which kept the 
world from war and of another 
factor which had whipped Man 
out of his rut almost a hundred 
years ago and had kept him at 
the gallop ever since. 

He had speculated about these 
matters in an idle way, he had 
said. 

But was his speculation idle? 

Or did Flanders know more 
than he was telling? 

And if he knew, what then? 

Vickers shoved back the chair 
and got to his feet. 

He looked at the time. It was 
almost two o'clock. 

No matter, he thought. It's 
time that I find out, even if I 
have to break into his house and 
jerk him out of bed, screaming in 
his nightshirt. 

He was sure that Flanders 
would wear a nightshirt instead 
of pajamas. 



RING AROUND THE SUN

¥ ONG before he reached Flanders' house, Vickers saw that 
there was something wrong. The 
place was lighted up from basement to garret. Men with lanterns 
were walking about the yards and 
there were other knots of men 
who stood around and talked , 
while all along the street women 
and children stood ofTthe porches 
in hastily snatched-up robes. As 
if, Vickers thought, they were 
waiting for a strange three A.M. 
parade that might at any momerit come winding down the 
street. 

A group of men were standing 
by the gate and as he turned in, 
he saw there were some he knew. 
There was Kb. the garage man, 
and Joe, the exterminator man, 
and Vic, who ran the drugstore. 

"Hello, Jay," said Eb, "we're 
glad you are here." 

"Hello, Jay," said Joe. 

"What's going on?" asked 
Vickers. 

"Old Man Flanders," said Vic, 
"has disappeared." 

"His housekeeper got up in the 
night to give him some medicine," said Eb, "and found he 
wasn't there. She looked around 
for him for a while and then she 
went to get some help." 

"You've searched for him?" 
asked Vickers. 

"Around the place," said Eb. 



"But we're going to start branching out now. We'll have to organize and get some system in 
it." 

The drugstore owner said, "We 
thought at first maybe he'd been 
up during the night wandering 
around the house or out into the 
yard and might have had a seizure 
of one kind or another. So we 
looked near at hand at first." 

"We've gone over the house," 
said Joe, "from top to bottom 
and we've combed the yard and 
there ain't hide nor hair of him." 

"Maybe he went for a walk," 
Vickers offered. 

"No man in his right mind," 
declared Joe, "goes walking after 
midnight." 

"He wasn't in his right mind, 
if you ask me," said Eb. "Not 
that I didn't like him. I did. 
Never saw a more mannerly old 
codger in all my born days, but 
he had funny ways about him." 

Someone with a lantern came 
down the brick-paved walk. 

"You men ready to get organized?" asked the man with the 
lantern. 

"Sure, Sheriff." said Eb. "Any 
time you are. We just been waiting for you to get it figured out." 

"Well," said the sheriff, "there 
ain't much that we can do until 
it gets light, but I thought we 
might take some quick scouts out 
around. Some of the other boys 
are going to cover the town, go 



42 




 



up and down all the streets and 
alleys, and I figured maybe some 
of you might like to have a look 
along the river." 

"That's all right with us," said 
Eb. "You just tell us what you 
want us to do." 

THHE sheriff lifted his lantern 
to shoulder height and looked 
at them. "Jay Vickers, ain't it? 
Glad you joined us, Jay. We need 
all the men there are." 

Vickers lied, without knowing 
why he lied: "I heard some commotion going on." 

"Guess you knew the old gent 
pretty well," said the sheriff. 
"Better than the most of us." 

"He used to come over and talk 
to me almost every day." 

"I know. We remarked about 
it. He never talked much to no 
one else." 

"We had some common interests." Vickers said, "and I think 
that he was lonely." 

"The housekeeper said he went 
over to see you last night." 

"Yes, he did," said Vickers. 
"He left shortly after midnight." 

"Notice anything unusual about 
him? Any difference in the way 
he talked?" 

"Now, look here. Sheriff," said 
Eb. "You think Jay had anything 
to do with this?" 

"No, I guess I don't." He lowered the lantern and said, "If you 
fellows would go down to the 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



river — split up when you get 
there — some of you go upstream 
and some of you go down. I don't 
expect you to find anything, but 
we might as well look. Be back at 
daylight and we'll really start 
combing for him." 

The sheriff turned away, walking back up the brick pavement 
with his lantern swinging. 

"I guess," said Eb, "we might 
as well get started. I'll take one 
bunch down the river and Joe 
will take the others up. That all 
right with the rest of you?" 

There was no objection. 

They walked out the gate and 
down the street until they hit the 
intersection, then went down to 
the bridge. 

"We split up here," said Eb. 
"Who wants to go with Joe?" 

Several men said they would. 

"All right," said Eb. "The rest 
of you come with me." 

They separated and plunged 
down from the street to the river 
bank. Cold river mist lay close 
along the bank and in the darkness they could hear the swift, 
smooth rush of the river. A night 
bird cried across the water. Looking out to the other bank, one 
could see the splintered starlight 
that shattered itself against the 
running current. 

Eb asked, "You think we'll 
find him, Jay?" 

Vickers spoke slowly. "No, I 
don't. I can't tell you why, but 

43 



somehow I am pretty sure we 
won't." 

XIV 

TT was early evening before 
Vickers returned home. The 
phone was ringing when he 
stepped inside the door. 

It was Ann Carter. "I've been 
trying to get you all day. I'm 
terribly upset. Where have you 
been?" 

"Out looking for a man," said 
Vickers. 

"Please don't be funny, Jay." 

"I'm not being funny. An old 
man, a neighbor of mine, disappeared. I've been out helping look 
for him." 

"Did you find him?" 

"l>to, we didn't." 

"That's too bad," she said. 
"Was he a nice old man?" 

"The best." 

"Maybe you'll find him later." 

"Maybe we will," said Vickers. 
"Why are you upset?" 

"You remember what Crawford said?" 

"He said a lot of things." 

"But what he told us would 
come next. You remember that?" 

"I can't say that I do." 

"He said clothing would be 
next. A dress for fifty cents." 

"Now that you mention it," 
said Vickers, "he did." 

"Well, it happened." 

"What happened?" 



"A dress. Only it wasn't fifty 
cents. It was fifteen!" 

"You bought one?" 

"No, I didn't, Jay. I was too 
scared. I was walking down Fifth 
Avenue and there was a sign in 
the window, a little discreet sign 
that said the dress on the model 
could be had for fifteen cents. 
Can you imagine that. Jay — a 
dress for fifteen cents on Fifth 
Avenue!" 

"No, I can't," Vickers confessed. 

"It was such a pretty dress," 
said Ann. "It shone. Not with 
stones or tinsel. The material 
shone. Like it was alive. And the 
color . . . Jay, it was the prettiest 
dress I have ever seen. And I 
could have bought it for fifteen 
cents, but I didn't have the nerve. 
I remembered what Crawford 
had told us and I stood there 
looking at the dress and I got 
cold all over." 

"Buck up. and go back in the 
morning. Maybe they'll still have 
it." 

"rpHAT isn't the point at all. 
_ -■- Don't you see? It proves what 
Crawford told us! It proves that 
he knew what he was talking 
about, that there really is a conspiracy, that the world does have 
its back against the wall." 

"And what do you want me to 
do about it?" 

"Why, I — I don't know, Jay. 



44 



GALAXY S C 1 E N C E FICTION 



I thought you would be interested." 

"I am," said Vickers. "Very 
interested." 

"Jay. there's something going 
on." 

"Keep your shirt on, Ann," 
said Vickers. "Sure, there's something going on." 

"What is it? I know it's more 
than Crawford said. I don't know 
how — " 

"I don't know, either. But it's 
bigger than you and I can handle. 
I have to think it out." 

"Jay." she said, and the sharp 
tenseness was gone from her 
voice. "Jay, I feel better now. It 
was nice to talk to you." 

"You go out in the morning," 
Jay told her," and buy up an armful of those fifteen-cent dresses. 
Get there ahead of the crowd." 

"The crowd? I don't understand." 

"Look, Ann," said Vickers. 
"Let us use our head. Fifth Avenue is going to have a crush of 
bargain hunters." 

"I guess you're right at that," 
she said. "Phone me tomorrow?" 

"I'll phone." 

They said good night and he 
hung up, stood for a moment, 
trying to remember the next 
thing that he should do. There 
was supper to get and the papers 
to bring in and he'd better see if 
there was any mail. 

He went out the door and 



walked down the path to the 
mailbox on the gatepost. He took 
out a slim handful of letters and 
leafed through them swiftly, but 
there was so little light he could 
not make out what they were. 
Advertising mostly, he suspected. 
And a few bills, although it was 
a bit early in the month for 
them. 

Back in the house he turned on 
the desk lamp and laid the pile 
of letters on the desk. Beneath 
the lamp lay the litter of tubes 
and disks that he had picked up 
from the floor the night before. 
He stood there staring at them, 
trying to bring them into correct 
perspective. It had only been the 
night before, but now it seemed 
as if it were many weeks ago that 
he had thrown the paperweight 
and there had been a crunching 
sound that had erupted with a 
shower of tiny parts rolling on 
the floor. 

He had stood there then, as 
he stood now. and knew there 
was an answer, a clue, if he only 
knew where to find it. 

A GAIN the phone rang and he 
went to answer it. 
It was Eb, asking, "What do 
you think of it?" 

"I don't know what to think," 
said Vickers. 

"He's in the river," Eb maintained. "That is where he is. 
That's what I told the sheriff. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



45 



They'll start dragging tomorrow 
morning as soon as the sun is up." 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"Maybe you're right, but I don't 
think he's dead." 

"Why don't you think so. Jay?" 

"No reason in the world," said 
Vickers. "No actual , solid rea son. Just a hunch." 

"The reason I called," Eb told 
him, "is that I got some of those 
Forever cars. Came in this afternoon. Thought maybe you might 
want one of them." 

"I hadn't thought much about 
it, Eb. Too many other things 
on my mind, I suppose." 

"I'll bring one up in the morning. Give you . a chance to try 
it out. See what you think of it." 

"That'll be fine," said Vickers, 
and said good-by. 

He went back to the desk and 
picked up the letters. There were 
no bills. Of the seven letters, six 
were advertising, the seventh in 
a plain white envelope addressed 
in a craggy hand. 

He tore it open. There was one 
sheet of white note paper, neatly 
folded. He unfolded it and read: 

My dear friend Vickers: 

I hope that you are not unduly 
worn out by the strenuous efforts 
which you undoubtedly will have 
thrown into the search for me today. 

I feel very keenly that my actions 
will impose upon the kind people of 
this excellent village a most unseemly 
amount of running around to the 
neglect of their business, though J do 



not doubt that they wilt enjoy it most 
thoroughly. 

I feel that I can trust your understanding not to reveal the fact of this 
fetter nor to engage any further than 
is necessary to convince our neighbors 
of your kindly intentions in what must 
necessarily be a futile hunt for me. I 
can assure you that I am most happy 
and that only the necessity of the 
moment made me do what I have done. 

I am writing this note for two reasons: First, to quiet any fear you may 
feel lor me. Secondly, to presume upon 
our friendship to the point of giving 
some unsolicited advice. 

It has seemed to me for some time 
now that you have been confining 
yourself too closely to your work and 
that a holiday might be an excellent 
idea, ft might be that a visit to your 
childhood scene, to walk again the 
paths you walked when you were a 
boy, could clear away the dust and 
make you see with clearer eyes. 
Your friend, 

H or ton Flanders 

XV 

T WILL not go, thought Vickers. 

I cannot go. The place means 
nothing to me and I do not want 
it to mean anything now that it is 
forgotten after all these years of 
trying to forget it. 

He could have shut his eyes 
and seen it — the yellow clay of 
the rain-washed cornfields, the 
roads all white with dust winding 
through the valleys and along the 
ridgetops, the lonely mailboxes 
sitting on forlornly leaning fence 
posts, the sagging gates, the 




 



weatherbeaten houses, the scraggy 
cattle coming down the lane, following the rutted path that their 
hoofs had made, the mangy dogs 
that ran out and barked at you 
when you drove past their farms. 

If I go back they'll ask me 
why I came and how I'm getting 
on. "Too bad about your Pa, he 
was a damn good man." They'd 
sit on the upturned boxes in front 
of the general store and chew 
slowly on their cuds of tobacco 
and spit out on the sidewalk and 
look at hin> out of slanted eyes 
and say, "So you write books. 
By God, some day I'll have to 
read one of your books; I never 
heard of them." 

He'd go to the cemetery and 
stand before a stone with his hat 
held in his hand and listen to the 
wind moan in the mighty pines, 
and he'd think, if only I could 
have amounted to something in 
time for you to have known, so 
that the two of you could have 
been proud of me and bragged 
about me a little when the neighbors dropped in for a visit — but, 
of course, I never did. 

And he would — finally, he admitted it — drive past the great 
brick house with the portico and 
the fanlights above the door. He 
would drive very slowly and he 
would look at it and see how the 
shutters had come loose and were 
sagging and how the paint was 
flaking and how the roses that 



had bloomed beside the gate had 
died. 

I won't go, he said. 

And yet, perhaps, he should. 

It might clear away the dust, 
Flanders had written, might make 
you see with clearer eyes. 

Might make him see what with 
clearer eyes? 

Was there something back 
there in his boyhood lanes that 
could explain this situation, some 
hidden fact, some abstract symbol, which he had missed before? 

Or was he imagining things, 
reading significance into words 
that had no significance? How 
could he be sure that Horton 
Flanders with his shabby suit and 
ridiculous cane had anything to 
do with the story that Crawford 
had spelled out about humanity 
standing with its back against the 
wall? 

There was no evidence at all. 

Yet Flanders had disappeared 
and had written him a letter. 

Clear away the dust, Flanders 
had written, so that you may see 
better. And all that he might 
have meant' was that he should 
clear away the dust so that he 
could write better. 

VICKERS put a hand on the 
manuscript and ruffled its 
pages with his thumb, an absent, 
almost loving gesture. So little 
done, he thought, so much still 
ed out the top drawer on the left 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



he'd done nothing on it. Two full, 
days wasted. 

To do the writing that should 
be done, he must be able to sit 
down calmly and concentrate , 
shut out the world and then let 
the world come in to him, a little 
at a time, a highly selected world 
that could be analyzed and set 
up with a clarity and sharpness 
that could not be mistaken. 

Calmly, he thought. How can a 
man be calm when he has a thousand questions and a thousand 
doubts boiling in his mind? 

FIRST was the moppet who 
had come to breakfast and 
after that the paper he had read. 
Then he'd gone down to get his 
car and Eb had told him about 
the Forever car. Because his car 
had not been ready, he'd gone to 
the drugstore corner to catch a 
bus. Mr. Flanders had come and 
joined him as he stared at the 
display in the gadget shop and 
Mr. Flanders had said — 

Wait a second. He had gone 
to the drugstore corner to get a 
bus. He had gotten on the bus 
and sat down in a seat next to the 
window. He'd looked out the window and no one else had come 
and sat down with him. He'd ridden to the city in a seat all to 
himself. 

That is it, he thought, and 
even as he thought it he felt a 
wild elation and then a sense of 



horror at an incident forgotten 
and he stood for a moment unmoving, trying desperately to blot 
out what had happened so many 
years ago. It would not blot out 
and he knew at once what he 
must do. 

He turned to the desk and pullto do. Now, for two whole days, 
side and slowly, methodically, 
took out the contents, one by 
one. He did this with all the 
drawers and did not find what 
he was looking for. 

The attic, perhaps. One of the 
boxes up there. 

He climbed the stairs and, 
reaching the top, blinked at the 
glow of the unshielded light bulb 
hanging from the ceiling. There 
was a chill in the air and in the 
starkness of the rafters, coming 
down on either side of him, like 
a mighty jaw about to close. 

Vickers went from the stairs 
to the storage boxes pushed 
against the eaves. In which one 
of the three would it be most 
likely to be found? He had no 
idea whatever. 

So he started with the first 
and he found it halfway down, 
under the old pair of bird shooters that he had hunted for last 
fall and had finally given up 
for lost. 

He opened the notebook and 
thumbed through it until he came 
finally to the pages that he was 
seeking.

IT must have been going on for 
years before he noticed it. The 
record said that it was worse 
than he had first imagined, that 
it concerned not only one phase 
of his existence, but many different phases. As the evidence accumulated, he stood aghast that 
he had not realized it before, because it was something which 
should have been obvious from 
the very first. 

The whole thing started with 
the reluctance of his fellow passengers to ride with him on the 
bus. He lived at the time in an 
old ramshackle boarding house at 
the edge of town near the end of 
the line. He'd get on in the morning and, being one of the few who 
boarded at that point, would take 
his favorite seat. 

The bus would fill up gradually 
as the stops were made, but it 
would be almost the end of the 
run before he'd have a seat companion. It didn't bother him, of 
course; in fact, he rather liked it 
that way, for then he could slump 
down in the seat and think and 
probably even doze a little without ever considering the need of 
civility. Not that he would have 
been especially civil in any case, 
he now admitted. The hour that 
he went to work was altogether 
too early for that. 

People would get on the bus 



and they'd sit with other people, 
not necessarily people whom they 
knew, for sometimes, Vickers noticed, they didn't exchange a single word for the entire ride with 
their seat mate. They'd sit with 
other people, but they'd never sit 
with him until all the other seats 
were filled and they had to sit 
with him or stand. 

Perhaps, he had told himself, 
it was body odor ; perhaps it 
was bad breath. He had made a 
ritual of bathing after that, using 
a new soap that was guaranteed 
to make him smell fresh. He 
brushed his teeth more attentively, used mouth wash until he 
gagged at the sight of it. 

It did no good. He still rode 
alone. 

He looked at himself in the 
mirror and he knew it was not his 
clothes, for in those days he was a 
smart dresser. 

So, he figured, it must be his 
attitude. Instead of slumping 
down in the seat, he'd sit up 
and be bright and cheerful and 
he'd smile at everyone. He'd smile 
if it cracked his face to do it. 

For an entire week he had sat 
there looking pleasant, smiling 
at people when they glanced at 
him, for all the world as if he 
were. a rising young business man 
who had read Dale Carnegie and 
belonged to the Junior Chamber. 

No one rode with him — not until there was no other seat. He 



RING AROUND THE 5UN 



49 



got some comfort in knowing 
they'd rather sit with him than 
stand. 

THHEN he had noticed other 
things. At the office, the fellows were always visiting around, 
gathering in little groups of three 
or four at one of the desks, talking about their golf scores or 
telling the latest dirty story or 
wondering why the hell a guy 
stayed on at a place like this 
when there were other jobs he 
could just walk out and take. 

No one ever came to his desk, 
so he tried joining one of the 
groups. Within a short time, the 
fellows would all drift back to 
their desks. He tried dropping 
by to pass the time of the day 
with individual workers. They 
were stlways affable enough, but 
always terribly busy. Vickers 
never stayed. 

He checked up on his conversational budget. It seemed fairly 
satisfactory. He didn't play golf, 
but he knew a few good stories 
and he read most of the latest 
books and saw the best of the 
recent movies. He could damn 
the office with the best of them, 
even though he liked working 
there. He read the newspapers 
and went through a couple of 
news weeklies and knew what was 
going on and could argue politics 
and had armchair opinions on 
military matters. With those 



qualifications, he felt, he should 
be able to carry on a fair conversation. But still no one seemed 
to want to talk to him. 

It was the same at lunch. It 
was the same, now that he had 
come to notice it, everywhere he 
went. 

He had written it down for a 
full six months, with dates and 
an account of each day, and now, 
fifteen years later, he sat on a 
box in a raw and empty attic and 
read the words he'd written. 
Staring straight ahead of him, he 
remembered how it had been, how 
he'd felt and what he'd said and 
done including the fact that no 
one would ride with him until 
all the seats were taken. And that 
was what had happened when 
he'd gone to New York just the 
other day. 

Why? 

He'd asked himself the question 
all those years ago and now, at 
last, he thought he knew the 
answer. 

It was because he was diff erent 
in some way, in some subtle way 
you couldn't put a finger on, but 
one that you could sense. 

A group of dogs would not 
tolerate a strange dog. They 
would smell him over and insult 
him and gang up on him and 
drive him away. 

Strange dog, he thought, that 
is what I am. A strange dog 
among the normal, barnyard dogs 



50 




 



of the human race. And these 
normal dogs do not accept me. 
They smell me over and walk 
stiff -legged and keep a wary eye 
upon me and at times, perhaps, 
they may even fear or hate me. 
My God, what am I? 

XVII 

SOMEONE was hammering on 
the door downstairs and shouting, but it was a moment or two 
before he realized it was his name 
that was being called. 

He rose from the box and the 
notebook fell from his fingers and 
fell rumpled on the floor, face 
downward, with its open pages 
caught and crumpled.^ 

"Jay!" the voice shouted. "Jay, 
are you here?" 

He stumbled down the stairs 
and into the living room. Eb stood 
just inside the door. 

"What's the matter, Eb?" 
"Listen, Jay," Eb told him, 
"you got to get out of here." 
"What for?" 

"They think you did away with 
Flanders." 

Vickers reached out a hand and 
caught the back of a chair and 
hung onto it. 

"I won't even ask you if you 
did," said Eb. "I'm pretty sure 
you didn't. That's why I'm giving 
you a chance." 

"A chance?" asked Vickers. 
"What are you talking about?" 



"They're down at the tavern 
now, talking themselves into a 
lynching party." 

"They?" 

"All your friends," Eb said, bitterly. "Someone got them all 
stirred up. I don't know who it 
was. I didn't wait to find out 
who. I came straight up here." 

"But I liked Flanders. I was 
the only friend he had." 

"You haven't any time," Eb 
said. "You've got to get away." 

"I can't go anywhere. I haven't 
got my car." 

"I brought up one of the Forever cars," said Eb. "No one 
knows I brought it. No one will 
know you have it." 

"I can't run away. They've got 
to listen to me." 

"You damn fool, this isn't the 
sheriff with a warrant. It's a mob 
and they won't listen to you." 
He strode across the room and 
grabbed Vickers roughly by the 
arm. "I risked my neck to come 
up here and warn you. After I've 
done that, you can't throw the 
chance away." 

Vickers shook the hand off. 
"All right, I'll go." 

"Money?" asked Eb. 

"I have some." 

"Here's some more." Eb reached into his pocket and held out a 
thin sheaf of bills. 

Vickers took it and stuck it in 
his pocket. 

"The car is full of gas," -said 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



51 



Eb. "The shift is automatic. It 
drives like any other car. I left 
the motor running." 

"I hate to do this, Eb." 

"I know just how you hate to, 
but if you want to save this town 
a killing, there's nothing else to 
do. Come on, get going." 

VICKERS trotted down the 
path and heard Eb pounding 
along behind him. The car stood 
at the gate. Eb had left the 
door wide open. 

"In you go," said Eb. "Cut 
straight over to the main highway." 

"Thanks, Eb." 
"Get out of here." 
Vickers pulled the shift to the 
drive position and stepped on 
the gK. The car floated away and 
swiftly gathered speed. He reached the main highway and swung 
in toward the west. 

He drove for miles, fleeing 
down the cone of brightness 
thrown by the headlights. He 
drove with a numb bewilderment 
that he should be doing this — 
that he, Jay Vickers, should be 
fleeing from a lynching party 
made up of his home town 
friends. 

They were not his friends, he 
reminded himself. They were the 
barnyard dogs and he was the 
strange dog -that had wandered 
in. He thought of them one by 
one, and as he thought of them 



their lips pulled back to reveal 
their fangs and there a savage 
growl rumbling in their throats. 

Someone, Eb had said, had got 
them all stirred up. Someone, 
perhaps, who hated ' him? But 
there was no one who hated him. 
No one he could think of. 

But even as he thought it, he 
knew who it was. He felt again 
the threat and the fear that he 
had felt when he had sat face 
to face with Crawford — the thenunrealized reaction that had made 
him refuse the offer to write 
Crawford's book. 

There's something going on, 
Horton Flanders had said, standing with him in front of the 
gadget shop. 

And there was something going on. 

There were everlasting gadgets 
being made by nonexistent firms. 
There was an organization of 
world businessmen, backed into a 
corner by a foe at whom they 
could not strike back. There was 
Horton Flanders talking of some 
new, strange factors which kept 
the world from war. There were 
Pretentionists, hiding from the 
actuality of today, playing dollhouse with the past. 

And, finally, here was Jay 
Vickers fleeing to the west. 

By midnight, he knew where 
he was going — where Horton 
Flanders had said that he should 
go, doing what he had said he 



52 




 



would certainly never do. 

He was going back to his own 
childhood. 

XVIII 

T^XACTLY the way he had expected, they sat out in front 
of the general store, on the bench 
and the upturned boxes, and 
turned sly eyes up toward him 
and they said: "Too bad about 
your Pa, Jay. He was a damn 
good man." 

They said : "So you write 
books, do you? Have to read one 
of your books someday. Never 
heard of them." 

They said : "You going out to 
the old place?" 

"This afternoon," said Vickers. 

"It's changed a whole lot. 
There ain't no one living there." 

"No one?" 

"Farming's gone to hell. Can't 
make no money at it. This carbohydrates business. Lots of folks 
can't keep their places. Farms 
around here being bought up for 
grazing — just fix the fences and 
turn some cattle in. Don't even 
try to farm. Buy feeder stuff 
out in the west and turn it loose 
the summer, then fatten it for 
fall." 

"That's what happened to the 
old place?" 

"That's what happened. Feller 
that bought it after your Pa, 
he couldn't make the riffle. Your 



Pa's place ain't the only one. 
There's been lots of others, too. 
You remember the old Preston 
place, don't you?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"Well, it happened there, too. 
And that was a good place. One 
of the best there was." 

"No one living there?" 

"No one. Somebody boarded 
up the doors and windows. Now 
why do you figure anyone would 
go to all the work of boarding 
up the place?" 

"I wouldn't know," said Vickers. 

The storekeeper came out and 
sat down on the steps. 

"Where you hanging out now, 
Jay?" he asked. 

"In the East." 

"Doing right well, I expect." 

"I'm eating every day." 

"Well," the storekeeper said, 
"anyone that can eat regular is 
doing downright well." 

"What kind of car is that you 
got?" another of them asked. 

"It's a new kind of car," said 
Vickers. "Just got it the other 
day. Called the Forever car." 

They said : "Now ain't that a 
hell of a name to call a car?" 

They said: "I imagine it cost 
you a pile." 

They said: "How many miles 
to a gallon do you get on it?" 

"I havtf to go now," Vickers 
replied, a little frantically. "See 
you on my way back." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



53 



He climbed into the car and 
sped away through the dowdy 
little village, anxious to go where 
there would be answers instead 
of questions, for he saw now that 
his own questions were even more 
urgent than he had suspected. 

XIX 

iHE gate to the farm was 
-■- chained and locked, so he 
parked the car beside the highway and walked the quarter mile 
down to the buildings. 

The farm road was overgrown 
with grass in places and kneehigh with weeds in others and 
only here and there could you 
find the sign of wheel-ruts. Some 
windows in the house were broken, probably by kids, and the 
door to the back porch had become unlocked and was swinging in the wind. 

• He waded through the sea of 
grass, walking around the house, 
astonished at how tenaciously the 
marks of living still clung about 
the place. There, on the chimney, 
running up the outside wall, were 
the prints of his ten -year old 
hands, impressed into wet mortar. At the corner of the house 
he found the old washtub where 
his mother each spring had planted the nasturtians, but the tub 
itself was almost goner its metal 
turned to rust and all that remained was a mound of earth. 



He did not try the door, for 
the outside was all he wished to 
see. There would be too much to 
see inside — the nail holes on the 
wall where the pictures had been 
hung and the marks on the floor 
where the stove had stood and 
the stairway with the treads 
worn smooth by beloved footsteps. If he went in, the house 
would cry out to him from the 
silences of its closets and the 
emptiness of its rooms. 

He walked down to the other 
buildings and they, for all their 
own silence and emptiness, were 
not so memory -haunted as the 
house. The henhouse was falling 
in and the hoghouse was a place 
for the winter winds to whistle 
through and he found an old, 
worn-out binder stored in the 
back of the cavernous machine 
shed. 

The barn was cool and shadowed. The stalls were empty, but 
the hay still hung in cobwebby 
wisps from the cracks in the floor 
of the mow and the place still had 
the half-misty, half-acid smell of 
living, friendly beasts. 

He climbed the incline to the 
granary and, sliding back the 
wooden latch, went in. Mice ran 
squeaking across the floor and up 
the walls and beams. A pile of 
grain sacks was draped across 
the partition that held the grain 
back from the alley way and a 
broken harness hung from a peg 



54 




 



upon the wall and there, at the 
end of alley, lay something that 
stopped him. 

TT was a child's top, battered 
now and with all its color 
gone, but once it had been bright 
and colorful and when it was 
pumped on the floor, it had spun 
and whistled. He had received it 
for Christmas and it had been a 
favorite toy of his. 

He picked it up and held its 
battered metal with a sudden 
tenderness and wondered how it 
had gotten there. It was a part of 
his past catching up with him — 
a dead and useless thing to everyone in all the world except the 
boy to whom it had once belonged. 

It had been a striped top and 
the colors had run in spiraling 
streaks when you spun it and 
there had been a point, he remembered, where each streak ran and 
disappeared. You could sit for 
hours watching the streaks come 
up and disappear, trying to make 
out where they went. For they 
must go somewhere, a boyish 
mind would figure. They couldn't 
be there one second and be gone 
the next. There must be somewhere for them to go. 

And there had been somewhere 
for them to go! 

You could go where the streaks 
went, into the land they fled to, 
if you were very young and could 



wonder hard enough. 

It was a sort of fairyland, al 
though it seemed more real than 
a fairyland should be. There was 
a walk that looked as if it were 
made of glass and there were 
birds and flowers and trees and 
some butterflies and he picked 
one of the flowers and carried it 
in his hand as he walked along 
the path. He had seen a little 
house hidden in a grove and 
when he saw it, he became a little 
frightened and walked back along 
the path and suddenly he was 
home, with the top dead on the 
floor in front of him and the flower clutched in his hand. 

He had told his mother and 
she had snatched away the flower, 
as if she'd been afraid of it. And 
well she might have been, for 
it was winter. 

That evening Pa had questioned him and found out about 
the top and the next day, when 
he*d looked for the top, he 
couldn't find it anywhere. He had 
cried off and on for days, secretly of course. 

And here it was again, an old 
and battered top, with no hint of 
the original color, but the same 
one, he was sure. 

He left the granary, carrying 
the battered top along with him. 
Through all the years, he had not 
remembered it, had not even suspected that there was an incident 
such as this hidden in his mind. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



55 



But now the top was with him 
once again and the day was with 
him, too — the day he'd followed 
the swirling streaks and walked 
into fairyland. 

XX 

HE told himself he would not 
stop at the Preston house. 
He would drive by and have a 
look at it, but he would not stop. 
For he was fleeing now. He had 
found an artifact of childhood 
that now brought only pain and 
frustration. 

He wouldn't stop at the Preston 
house. He'd just slow down and 
look, then speed up the car and 
put the miles behind him. 
He wouldn't stop, he said. 
Bufc of course, he did. 
He sat in the car and gazed 
at the house and remembered 
that it once had been proud and 
had sheltered a family that had 
been proud as well — too proud 
to let a member of its family 
marry a country lad from a farm 
of sickly corn and yellow clay. 

But the house was proud no 
longer. The shutters were closed 
and someone had nailed long 
planks across them. The paint 
was scaling and peeling from the 
stately columns that ran across 
its front. 

He got out of the car and 
walked through the drooping 
front gate up to the porch. Climb


ing the stairs, lie saw how the 
floor boards had rotted. 

He stood where the two of 
them first had known their love 
would last forever and he tried 
to catch that moment of the past 
and it was not there. He tried 
to remember how the meadows 
and the fields and yard had 
looked from the porch, with the 
white moonlight upon them. He 
knew, but he could not feel or 
see them. 

On the slope behind the house 
were the barns. Beyond them, the 
ground sloped down and there 
stretched out before him the valley they had walked that last 
time he had seen her. 

It had been an enchanted valley, he remembered, with apple 
blossoms and the song of lark. 

It had been enchanted once. It 
had not been the second time. But 
what about the third? 

He told himself that he was 
chasing rainbow ends, but while 
he told himself, he was walking 
down the slope, down past the 
barns and on into the valley. 

At the head of it, he stopped 
and looked and it was not enchanted, but he remembered it, 
as he had remembered the moonlight on the columns. He saw the 
crab apple thickets, with the blossoms fallen now, and once a lark 
soared out of the grass and flew 
into the sky. 

But the third visit here had 



56 




 



been the same as the second. 
It had been she who had turned 
this prosaic valley into an enchanted place. It had been, after 
all, an enchantment of the spirit. 

Twice he had walked in enchanted places. 

Twice. Once because of a girl 
and the love between them. Once 
again because of a spinning top. 

No, the top had been the first. 

Yes, the top — 

Now wait a minute! Not so 
fast! 

You're wrong, Vickers. It 
wouldn't be that way. 

You crazy fool, what are you 
running for? 

XXI 

THE manager of the dime store, 
when Vickers sought him out, 
seemed to understand. 

"You know," he said, "I understand just how you feel. I had 
a top like that myself when I 
was a kid. There's nothing like 
a top to play with.'' 

"Especially those big ones," 
said Vickers. "The ones with the 
handle on them and you pumped 
them on the floor and they 
whistled." 

"Sat and played with it for 
hours when I was a kid." 

"Watching where the stripes 
went?" 

"I don't recall I worried much 
about where the stripes might go. 



I just sat and watched it spin 
and listened to it whistle." 

"I used to worry about where 
they went. You know how it is. 
They travel up and then they disappear, somewhere near the top." 

"Tell me," said the manager, 
"where do they go?" 

"I don't know," Vickers admitted. 

"There's another dime store 
down the street a block or two. 
Carries a lot of junky stuff, but 
they might have a top like that 
left over." 

"Thanks," said Vickers. 

"You could also try the hardware store across the street. They 
carry quite a stock of toys, but 
I suppose they got them put 
away down in the basement. They 
only get them out at Christmas 
time." 

The man at the hardware store 
knew what Vickers wanted, but 
he didn't have one. The other 
dime store didn't either. No, said 
the girl, chewing gum and thrusting a pencil back and forth into 
the wad of hair above her ear, she 
didn't know where he might get 
one. There were a lot of other 
things here if he wanted to get 
something for a little boy. Like 
those toy rockets or these — 

He went out on the sidewalk, 
watching the late afternoon crowd 
of shoppers in the little Midwestern town. There were women in 
print dresses and other women 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



57 



in sleek business suits and there 
were high school kids just out of 
class and businessmen out for a 
cup of coffee. He saw a crowd 
of loafers gathered around his 
Forever car, parked in front of 
the first dime store. It was time, 
he thought, to feed that parking 
meter. 

He reached into his pocket. The 
coins made him wonder about 
the money in his billfold, so he 
took it out and flipped it open 
and saw that all he had .left 
were two dollar bills. 

Since he couldn't go back to 
Cliffwood, he had no place to 
call his home. He'd need money 
for lodging for the night and for 
meals and for gasoline — but more 
than that, more than anything, he 
was Ifi need of a singing top that 
had colored stripes painted on its 
belly. 

"IflCKERS stood in the middle 
* of the sidewalk, thinking 
about the top. It had worked 
once before, when he was a child, 
before Pa had taken the top away 
from him. 

What would have happened to 
him if it had not been hidden 
away? He wondered if he would 
have gone again and again, once 
he had found the way, back into 
that fairyland and what might 
have happened there, whom and 
what he might have met and what 
he would have found in the house 



hidden in the grove. For he eventually would have gone to the 
house. Having watched it long 
enough to grow accustomed to 
it, he would have followed the 
path across the grove and gone 
up to the door and knocked. 

He wondered if anyone else had 
ever watched a spinning top and 
walked into fairyland. And he 
wondered, if they had, what had 
happened to them. 

The dime store manager had 
not done it. He had never wondered where the stripes might 
go. He had just sat and watched 
and listened to the whistle. 

Vickers wondered what he was. 
that he should have found the 
way. And he wondered if the enchanted valley might not have 
been a part of fairyland as well 
and if somehow the girl and he 
might not have walked through 
another unseen gate. For surely 
the valley that he remembered 
was not the valley he had walked 
that morning. 

A top, he thought. Somewhere, 
someplace, somehow, I must find 
a top. 

But, of course, he had a top. 
The handle of it would have to 
be straightened and it might need 
a bit of oil to clear away the 
rust and it would have to be 
painted. 

More than likely it would be 
better than any other he could 
get, for it would be the original

top — and it pleased him to think 
that it might have certain special 
qualities, a certain mystic function no other top might have. 

He was glad that he had 
thought of it, lying there, forgotten for the second time, in 
the glove compartment where he 
had tossed it after finding it 
again. 

He walked up the street to the 
hardware store. 

"I want some paint," said Vickers. "The brightest, glossiest paint 
you have. Red and green and 
yellow. And some little brushes 
to put it on with." 

XXII 

HE called Ann from his hotel 
room, collect, since, after 
eating dinner, he had only ninety 
cents. 

She sounded harried. "Where 
in the name of heaven did you 
go?" 

He told her where he was. 

"But why are you there?" she 
asked him. "What is the matter 
with you?" 

"There's nothing wrong with 
me," said Vickers. "That is, nothing yet. I am just a fugitive." 

"You are what?" 

"I got run out of Cliff wood. 
They were fixing up a necktie 
party. Somehow or other they 
got it into their heads that I had 
killed a man." 



"Now I know you're crazy. 
You wouldn't kill a fly." 

"But I couldn't explain that to 
them. I didn't have a chance." 

"Why," said Ann, "I talked to 
Eb . . ." 

"You talked to who?" 

"You know, the man in the 
garage. For two whole days I beat 
the bushes for you. I called your 
home and there was no one there, 
so I remembered you talking 
about Eb, the garageman, and I 
asked the operator to let me talk 
to him." 

"What did Eb say?" 

"He said he hadn't noticed you 
around, but he didn't know where 
you were. He told me not to 
worry." 

"Eb was the one who tipped 
me off," said Vickers. "He gave 
me a car and some money and 
saw me out of town." 

"Of all the silly things. Who 
was it they thought you killed?" 

"Horton Flanders. He's the old 
man that got lost." 

"But you wouldn't kill him. 
You said he was a nice old man. 
You told me so yourself." 

"Look, Ann," said Vickers, "I 
didn't kill anyone. Someone just 
got the boys stirred up." 

"But you can't go back to 
Cliff wood." 

"No, I can't." 

"What will you do, Jay?" 

"I don't know. Just stay hid 
out, I guess."

C?TF7"HY didn't you call me 
right away?" demanded 
Ann. "What are you way out 
West for? You should have come 
straight to New York. New York 
is the swellest place there, is for 
someone to hide out. You might 
at least have called me." 

"Now wait a minute," Vickers 
said. "I called you, didn't I?" 

"Sure. You called me because 
you're broke and want me to wire 
some money and you — " 

"I haven't asked for any money 
yet." 

"You will." 

"Yes," he said, "I'm afraid I 
will." 

"Aren't you interested in why 
I was trying to get hold of you?" 

"Mildly," said Vickers. "Because ^ou don't want me to get 
out from under your thumb. No 
agent wants their best author to 
get from under — " 

"Some day I'm going to crucify 
you and hang you up along the 
roadside as a warning." 

"I would make a most pathetic 
Christ. You couldn't choose a 
better man. All right, why did 
you want me?" 

"Because Crawford's practically frantic. He won't quibble. I 
mentioned a fantastic figure and 
he didn't even shiver." 

"I thought we disposed of Mr. 
Crawford," Vickers said. 

"You don't dispose of Crawford." Her voice was quiet but 



strained. "Crawford is a badly 
frightened man. He came to me. 
Imagine that! He came into my 
office, puffing and panting, and 
I was afraid I didn't have a 
chair in the place strong enough. 
But you remember that old oak 
one over in the corner? It was 
one of the first sticks of furniture 
I ever bought for my office and 
I kept it as a sentimental piece. 
Well, it did the trick." 
"What trick?" 

"It held him," said Ann, triumphantly. "He'd have simply 
crushed anything else in the 
place. You remember what a big 
man he is." 

"Gross," Said Vickers. "That's 
the word you want." 

"He said, 'Where's Vickers?' 
And I said, 'Why ask me? I don't 
keep a leash on Vickers.' And 
he says, 'You're his agent, aren't 
you?' And I said, 'Yes, the last 
time I heard, but Vickers is a 
very changeable sort of man. 
There's no telling about him.' 
He says he's got to have Vickers. 
And so I said, 'Well, go get him. 
You'll find him around somewhere.' He said, 'The sky's the 
limit. Name any price, make any 
terms you want.* " 

"The man's a crackpot," Vickers said. 

"There's nothing crackpot about 
the kind of money he's offering." 

"How do you know he's got 
the money?" 



60 




 



"Well, I don't know. Not for 
sure, that is. But he must have." 

"Speaking of money," Vickers 
said, "have you got a loose hundred lying around? Or fifty, 
even?" 

"I can get it." 

"Wire it here. I'll pay you 
back." 

"All right," she said. "It isn't 
the first time I've bailed you out 
and I don't imagine it will be 
the last. But will you tell me 
one thing?" 

"What's that?" 

"What are you going to do?" 

"As soon as I get through talking to you," said Vickers, "I'm 
going to do some painting." 

"A house?" 

"No, a top." 

"The top of what?" 

"Not the top of anything. A 
top. A toy kids play with. You 
spin it on the floor." 

"Now listen to me," she said. 
"You cut out this playing around 
and come home to Ann." 

"After the experiment," said 
Vickers. 

"Tell me about it, Jay." 

"I'm going to try to get into 
fairyland." 

"Quit talking foolish." 

"I did it once before. No, 
twice." 

"Listen, Jay. This business is 
serious. Crawford is scared and 
so am I. And there's this lynching threat, too. There's no time 



for kidding or playing games," 
"Send me the money," Vickers 

said. 

"Right away." 

"I'll see you in a day or two." 

"Call me tomorrow. Take care 
of yourself. I don't know what 
you're up to, but take care of 
yourself." 

"I'll do both," Vickers promised. "Take care of myself and 
call you tomorrow." 

"I'll kill you if you don't." * 

"Ann," he said unhappily, "you 
could choose your colloquialisms 
a little more tactfully." 

XXIII 

TIE straightened the handle 
which spun the top and he 
polished the metal before marking off the spirals with a pencil 
and he borrowed a can of sewing 
machine oil and oiled up the 
spinning spiral on the handle so 
that it worked smoothly. Then 
he went about the painting. 

He got paint on his hands and 
on his clothes and on the chair 
he laid the top on and he spilled 
the can of red paint on the floor, 
but he picked it up so quickly 
that scarcely any of it ran out 
onto the carpeting. 

Finally the job was finished 
and it looked fairly good. 

He worried whether it would 
be dry by morning, but he read 
the labels on the cans and the la

61 



bels said the paint was quick drying, so he was somewhat relieved. 

He was ready now, ready to see 
what he would find when he spun 
the top. It might be fairyland 
and it might be nothing. Most 
likely it would be nothing, for 
more would go into it than the 
spinning of the top- — The mind 
and the faith and the pure simplicity of a child. And he didn't 
have that any longer. 

He went out and closed and 
locked the door behind hjm, then 
went down the stairs. The town 
and the hotel were too small to 
have elevators. Although not so 
small a town as the little village 
that had been "town" to him in 
fiis childhood days, that little village where they still sat out on 
the bench in front of the store 
and Tooked up at you with sidewise glances and asked you impudent, prying questions out of 
which to weave the fabric of long 
gossiping. 

He chuckled, thinking of what 
they'd say when the word got 
back of how he had fled from 
Cliffwood on the threat of being 
lynched. 

"He always was a sly one and 
not up to any good," they would 
say. "His Ma and Pa were real 
good people, though. Beats hell 
how a son sometimes turns out 
no matter if his Ma and Pa were 
honest people." 

He went through the lobby and 



out the door and stood out on the 
street. 

Maybe, he thought, he should 
have told Ann that it had been 
Crawford who had stirred up the 
boys in Cliffwood. Not Crawford 
himself, perhaps, but some of 
Crawford's henchmen. 

But maybe it was just as well 
that he hadn't told Ann. There 
was no use worrying her, and if 
he'd told her, she'd have wanted 
to know how he knew it had 
been Crawford and why had 
Crawford done it. And, of course, 
he couldn't tell her that. 

AT a diner, Vickers ordered a 
cup of coffee and the waitress said to him, "Nice night, isn't 
it?" 

"Yes, it is," he said. 

"You want anything to go 
with that coffee, mister?" 

"No," said Vickers. "Just the 
coffee." 

She moved on up the counter 
and wiped off imaginary spots 
with a cloth she carried in her 
hand. 

A top, he thought. Where did it 
tie in? He'd take the top to 
the house and spin it and would 
know once and for all if there 
were a fairyland — well, no, the 
flower in winter had been proof of 
that. He'd know if he could get 
back into fairyland. 

And the house. Where did the 
house tie in? 



62 




 



Or did either the house or the 
top tie in? 

And if they didn't tie in, why 
had Horton Fl anders written : 
"Go back and travel the paths 
you walked in childhood. Maybe 
there you will find a thing you'll 
need — or something that is missing." He wished he could remember the exact words Flanders 
had used, but he could not. 

So he had come back and he 
had found a top and, more than 
that, he had remembered fairyland. And why, he asked himself, 
in all the years since he had 
been eight, had he never recalled 
that enchanted visit? 

It had made a deep impression 
on him at the time, of that there 
was no doubt, for once he remembered it, it had been as clear and 
sharp as if it had just happened. 

But something had made him 
forget it, some mental block, perhaps. And something had made 
him know that the metal mouse 
had wanted to be trapped. And 
something had made him instinctively refuse Crawford's proposition. 

Strange dog, he said. You're a 
strange dog, Vickers. 

The waitress came back down 
the counter and leaned on her 
elbow. 

"You like pictures, mister?" 
asked the girl. 

"1 don't know," said Vickers. 
"I seldom go to them." 



Her face said she sympathized 
with anyone who didn't. "I just 
live for them," she said. 

He looked up at her and saw 
she wore the face of Everyone. It 
was the face of the two women 
who talked in the seat behind him 
on the bus; it was the face of 
Mrs. Leslie, saying to him, "Some 
of us are going to organize a 
Pretentionist club . . ." And, yes, 
it was the face of Mrs. Leslie's 
husband, crowding drink and 
women into a barren life. It was 
the face of grinding anxiety that 
had become commonplace, that 
sent people fleeing for psychological shelters against the bombs of 
uncertainty. 

Cynicism had run out and 
flippancy had never been more 
than a temporary shield. So now 
the people fled to the drug of pretense, identifying themselves with 
another life and another time and 
place — at the movie theater or 
on the television screen or in the 
Pretentionist movement. For so 
long as you were someone else, 
you need not be yourself, vulnerable and afraid. 

He finished his coffee and went 
out. 

Overhead, a jet plane flashed 
past, streaking low, the snarl of 
its tubes bouncing back against 
the walls. He watched its lights 
draw twin lines of fire over the 
night horizon, and then went for 
a walk.

"W/HEN Vickers opened the 
door of his room, he saw 
thaj the top was gone. He had 
left it on the chair, gaudy in its 
new paint, and it wasn't on the 
chair or on the floor. He got 
down on his belly and looked 
underneath the bed and it wasn't 
there. Nor was it in the closet and 
or in the hall outside. 

He came back into the room 
again and sat down on the edge 
of the bed. 

After all his worry and planning, the top had disappeared. 
Who would have stolen it? What 
would anyone want with a battered top? 

What had he himself wanted 
with it? 

It seemed faintly ridiculous 



64 



G 



now, sitting on the edge of the 
bed in a strange hotel room, to 
ask himself these questions. 

He had thought the top would 
buy his way into fairyland and 
now, in the white glare of the 
ceiling light, he wondered at himself for the madness of his antics. 

Behind him, the door came 
open and he heard it and turned 
around sharply. 

In the door stood Crawford, 
even more massive than Vickers 
had remembered him. He filled 
the doorway and he stood motionless, without a single flicker 
except for the eyelids. 

Crawford said, "Good evening, 
Mr. Vickers. Won't you ask me 
to come in?" 

"Certainly," said Vickers. "I 
was waiting for a call from you. 
I never thought you would take 



the trouble to travel here in 
person." 

And that was a lie, of course, 
because he'd not been waiting 
for a call. 

Crawford moved ponderously 
across the room. "This chair looks 
strong enough to hold me. You 
don't mind, I hope." 

"It's not my chair. Go ahead 
and bust it." 

It creaked and groaned, but it 
held. 

Crawford relaxed and sighed. 
"I always feel so much better 
when I get a good strong chair 
beneath me." 

"You tapped Ann's phone," 
said Vickers. 

"Why, certainly. How else 
would I have found you? I knew 
that, sooner or later, you would 
call her." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



65 



"I saw the plane come in. If 
I had known it was you, I'd have 
driven out to meet you." 

Crawford chuckled. "I'll bet." 

"Damned right I would. I have 
a bone to pick with you." 

"I don't doubt it," Crawford 
said. "Which in particular?" 

"Why did you almost get me 
lynched?" 

"I wouldn't have you lynched," 
said Crawford. "I'm too much in 
need of you." 

"What for?" 

"I don't know. I thought maybe you would know." 

"Crawford, what is this all 
about? You didn't tell me the 
truth that day I came in to see 
you." 

"I told you the truth, or at 
least part of it. I couldn't tell 
you everything we knew." 

"Why not?" 

"I didn't know who you were." 
"But you seem to know now." 

WV"ES. I do," said Crawford. 
"You are one of them." 

"One of whom?" 

"One of the gadgeteers." 

"What in hell makes you think 
so?" 

"Analyzers. That's what the 
psycli boys call them. We had 
analyzers in your house. The 
damn things are uncanny. I don't 
pretend to understand them." 

"And the analyzers said I was 
a strange dog." 



"Translate, please," said Crawford, puzzled. 

"You know how a strange dog 
is. The other dogs all come out 
to meet it and they sniff it over 
and circle around and growl a 
bit and take an experimental nip 
or two. And all the time the 
strange dog stands there, stiff and 
still, not moving at all, waiting 
for the other dogs to pass inspection on it." 

"I see. Yes, I guess we sniffed 
you some." 

"I warn you, Crawford. I won't 
stand still. I won't let you take 
any nips." 

"I'm not nipping at you." 

"Not yet," said Vickers. "If I 
am one of them, you are fighting 
me. A world with its back against 
the wall. Remember." 

"Don't say 'if.' You are one of 
them, but quit acting as if I were 
an enemy." 

"If I am what you say I am, 
you are an enemy." 

"You don't understand," said 
Crawford. "Let's try analogy. 
Let's go back to the day when 
the Cro-Magnon drifted into 
Neanderthaler territory . . ." 

"Don't give me analogy," Vickers told him. "Tell me what is on 
your mind." 

"I just plain don't like the 
situation." 

"You forget that I don't know 
what the situation is." 

"That's what I was trying to 



66 




 



tell you with my analogy. You 
are the Cro-Magnon. You have 
the bow and arrow and the spear. 
I am the Neanderthaler. I only 
have a club. You have clothing 
fashioned out of hides and furs 
and I have nothing but the hair 
I stand in." 

"I wouldn't know," said Vickers. 

"I'm not so sure myself," Crawford admitted. "I'm not up on 
that sort of stuff. Maybe I gave 
the Cro-Magnon a bit too much 
and the Neanderthaler a bit too 
little. But that's not the point 
at all." 

"I get the point. Where do we 
go from there?" 

fr r X , HE Neanderthaler fought 
■■■ back," said Crawford, "and 
what happened to him?" 

"He became extinct." 

"They may have died for 
many reasons besides the spear 
and arrow. Perhaps they were 
squeezed out of their hunting 
grounds. Perhaps they died of 
shame — the knowledge that they 
were outdated, that they were, by 
comparison, little more than 
beasts." 

"I doubt," said Vickers, "that 
a Neanderthaler could work up a 
very powerful inferiority complex." 

"The suggestion may not apply 
to the Neanderthaler. It does 
apply to us."

"You're trying to make me see 
how deep the cleavage goes." 

''That is what I'm doing," 
Crawford told him. "You can't 
realize the depth of hate, the 
margin of intelligence and ability. 
Nor can you realize how desperate we really are. 

"Who are these desperate men? 
I'll tell you. They're the successful ones, the industrialists, the 
bankers, the businessmen, the 
professional men, those who have 
security and hold positions of 
importance, who move in social 
circles which mark the high tide 
of our culture. 

"They'd no longer hold their 
positions if your kind of men took 
over. They'd be Neanderthaler to 
your Cro-Magnon. They'd survive physically, but they'd be 
aboriginees. Their values would 
be swept away and those values, 
built up painfully, are all they 
have to live by." 

Vickers shook his head. "I 
suppose I should pretend I know 
as much as you think I do — act 
smart and make you believe I 
know all there is to know. Fence 
with you. Get you to tip your 
hand. I'd rather be honest and 
say it's all Greek to me." 

"I know it is. That's why I 
wanted to reach you as soon as 
possible. You haven't yet shed the 
chrysalis of an ordinary man. 
The tendency is to shift toward 
mutation — more today than yes


terday, more tomorrow than today. But tonight, in this room, 
you and I still can talk man to 
man." 

"We could always talk." 

"No, we couldn't," Crawford 
dissented. "If you were entirely 
mutant, I'd feel the difference in 
us. Without equality I'd doubt 
the soundness of my logic. As it 
is, you're doubting yours, which 
gives me an advantage. I won't 
have that advantage when you 
finish mutating."* 

"Just before you came in," said 
Vickers, "I'd almost convinced 
myself it was all imagination . . ." 

"It's not imagination, Vickers. 
You had a top, remember?" 

"The top is gone." 

"Not gone," said Crawford. 

"You have it?" 

"No, I haven't. I don't know 
where it is, but it still is somewhere in this room. You see, I got 
here before you did and I picked 
the lock. Incidentally, a very 
inefficient lock." 

"Incidentally," said Vickers, "a 
very sneaky trick." 

"Granted. And before this is 
over, I'll commit other sneaky 
tricks. But to go back. I picked 
the lock and walked into the 
room and I saw the top and wondered and I — well, I — " 

"Go on." 

"Look, Vickers, I had a top 
like that when I was a kid. Long, 
long ago. So I picked it up and

spun it. For no reason. Well, yes, 
there may have been a reason. 
Maybe an attempt to regain a 
lost moment of my childhood. 
And the top . . 

He stopped speaking and stared 
hard at Vickers, as if he might 
be trying to detect some sign of 
laughter. When he spoke again, 
his voice was almost casual. 

"The top disappeared." 

VICKERS said nothing. 
"What was it?" Crawford 
asked. "What kind of top was 
that?" 

"I don't know. Were you 
watching it when it disappeared?" 

"No. I thought I heard someone in the hall. I took a fast 



glance. It was gone when I looked 
baclf." 

"It shouldn't have disappeared," said Vickers. "Not without you watching it." 

"There was some reason for 
the top. You had painted it. You 
wouldn't go to all that trouble 
without some purpose. What was 
the top for, Vickers?" 

"To go into fairyland." 

"You're talking riddles," snapped Crawford irritably. 

"I went — physically — when I 
was a kid." 

"Ten days ago, I would have 
said both of us were crazy, you 
for saying it and I for believing 
it. I can't say it now." 

"We still may be crazy, or, at 



RING AROUND THE SUN

best, just a pair of fools." 

"We're neither fools nor crazy," 
Crawford said. "We are men, the 
two of us, not quite the same 
and more different by the hour, 
but we still are men and not 
crazy or fools." 

"Why did you come here, 
Crawford? Don't tell me just to 
talk. You're too anxious. You 
had a tap on Ann's phone to find 
out where I'd gone. You sneaked 
into my room and you spun the 
top. All right, why?" 

"I came here to warn you that 
the men I represent are desperate, 
that they will stop at nothing. 
They won't be taken over." 

"And if they have no choice?" 

"They have a choice. They can 
fight with what they have." 

"The Neanderthalers fought 
with clubs." 

"So will Homo sapiens. Clubs 
against your arrows. That's why 
I want to talk to you. There must 
be some area for agreement." 

"Ten days ago," said Vickers, 
"I sat in your office and talked 
*with you. You described the situation and you said you were 
mystified and stumped. To hear 
you tell it then, you didn't have 
the ghost of an idea what was 
going on. Why did you He to 
me?" 

CRAWFORD sat stolidly, unmoving, no change of expression on his fare. "We had the 



machine on you, remember? The 
analyzers. We wanted to find out 
how much you knew." 

"How much did I know?" 

"Not a thing. All we found 
out was that you were a latent 
mutant." 

"Then why pick me out?" demanded Vickers. "Except for 
what you tell me, I have no reason to believe that I am a mutant. 
I know no mutants. I can't speak 
for mutants. If you want to make 
a deal, go catch yourself a real, 
honest-to-God mutant." 

"We picked you out," said 
Crawford, "for a simple reason. 
You are the only mutant we 
could lay a finger on. You and 
one other — and the other is even 
less aware than you." 

"But you think there are more." 

"We know there are. But we 
can't catch them. You can pin 
them down only when they want 
to see you. Otherwise they are always out." 

"Out?" 

"They disappear," explained 
Crawford harshly. "We track 
them down and wait. We send in 
word and wait. We ring doorbells 
and wait. We never find them in. 
They go in a door, but they aren't 
in the room. We wait for hours to 
see them and then find out they 
weren't in the place where we'd 
seen them go at all, but somewhere else, maybe miles away." 

"But me — me you can track

down. I don't disappear." 
"Not yet." 

"Maybe I'm a moronic mutant." 

"An undeveloped one." 

"You picked me out," said 
Vickers. "In the first place, I 
mean. You had some reason to 
suspect before I knew." 

Crawford chuckled. ' 'Your 
writing. Our psych department 
spotted it. We found some others 
that way. A couple of artists, an 
architect, a sculptor, one or two 
scientists. Don't look so startled, 
Vickers. When you organize 
world industry, you have, in 
terms of cash and manpower, a 
crack outfit that can perform tremendous jobs of research — or 
anything else that you put it to. 
You'd be surprised how much 
work we've done, the areas we 
have covered. But it's not enough. 
I don't mind telling you that 
we've been licked at every turn." 

"So now you want to bargain." 

"I do. Not the others. They're 
fighting for the world they've 
built through many bloody 
years." 

AND that was it, thought 
Vickers. Through many 
bloody years. 

Horton Flanders had sat on the 
porch and talked of war and why 
World War III somehow hadn't 
happened and he had said that 
maybe someone or something had 



stepped in, time and again, to 
prevent it from happening. Intervention, he had said, rocking back 
and forth. 

"This world they built," Vickers pointed out, "hasn't been too 
good a world. It was built with 
much blood and misery; it mixed 
too many bones into the mortar. 
During all its history, there's 
hardly been a year when there 
wasn't violence somewhere on 
Earth." 

"I know what you mean," said 
Crawford. "You think there 
should be a reorganization." 

"Something like that." 

"Let's do some figuring then," 
Crawford invited. "Let's try to 
thrash it out." 

"I can't. I have no knowledge 
and I have no authority. I haven't 
even contacted or been contacted 
by these mutants of yours — if 
they are really mutants." 

"The analyzer says they are 
mutants. It said you are." 

"How can you be sure?" asked 
Vickers. 

"You don't trust me. You think 
I'm a renegade, that I see sure 
defeat ahead and have come running, waving the white flag, anxious to make my individual peace 
and to hell with all the rest of 
them, that maybe the mutants 
will keep me as a mascot or a 
pet." 

"If what you say is true, you 
and the rest of them are licked, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



71 



no matter what you do." 

"Not entirely licked," said 
Crawford. "We can hit back. We 
can raise a lot of hell." 

"With what? You only have a 
club." 

"We have desperation." 
"Aclub and desperation? That's 
all?" 

"We have a secret weapon." 
"And the others want to use 
it." 

Crawford nodded. "But it isn't 
good enough, which is why I'm 
here." 

"I'll get in touch with you," 
said Vickers. "That's the best 
that I can do. When and if I find 
you're right, I'll get in touch with 
you." 

CRAWFORD heaved himself 
out*of the chair. "Make it 
quick as possible. I can't hold 
them off long." 

"You're scared," said Vickers. 
"You were frightened the first 
day I saw you and you still are." 

"I've been scared ever since it 
started. It gets worse every day." 
"Two frightened men." 



"You, too?" 

"Of course. Can't you see me 
shaking?" 

"No, I can't. In some ways, 
Vickers, you're the most coldblooded man I have ever met." 

"One thing," said Vickers. 
"You said there was another mutant you could catch." 

"Yes, I told you that." 

"Any chance of knowing who?" 

"Not a chance," said Crawford. 

"I didn't think there was." 

The rug seemed to blur a little, 
then the top was there, spinning 
slowly, its hum choked off, its 
colors blotched with its erratic 
wobbling. 

They stood and watched it until it stopped and lay upon the 
floor. 

"It went away," said Crawford. 

"And now it's back," Vickers 
whispered. 

Crawford shut the door behind 
him. Vickers stood in the cold, 
bright room with the motionless 
top on the floor, listening to 
Crawford's footsteps going down 
the hall.

Homesick 

By LYN VENABLE 



What thrill is there in going 
out among the stars if coming 
back means bitter loneliness? 



FRANKSTON pushed listlessly at a red checker with 
his right forefinger. He 
knew the move would cost him 
a man, but he lacked enough interest in the game to plot out a 
safe move. His opponent, James, 
jumped the red disk with a black 
king and removed it from the 
board. Gregory, across the room, 
nicked rapidly through the pages 
of a magazine, too rapidly to be 
reading anything, or even looking at the pictures. Ross lay 
quietly on his bunk, staring out 
of the viewport. 

The four were strangely alike 

Illustrated by EMSH 



H OM ESI C K

in appearance, nearly the same 
age, the age where gray hairs 
finally outnumber black, or baldness takes over. The age when the 
expanding waistline has begun to 
sag tiredly, when robust middle 
age begins the slow accelerating 
decline toward senility. 

A strange .group to find aboard 
a spaceship, but then The Columbus was a very strange ship. 
Bolted to its outer hull, just under the viewports, were wooden 
boxes full of red geraniums, and 
ivy wound tenuous green fronds 
over the gleaming hull that had 
withstood the bombardment of 
pinpoint meteors and turned 
away the deadly power of naked 
cosmic rays. 

Frankston glanced at his wrist chrono. It was one minute to six. 

'♦I n about a minute," he 
thought, "Ross will say something about going out to water 
his geraniums." The wristchrono 
ticked fifty-nine times. 

"I think I'll go out and water 
my geraniums," said Ross. 

TVTO ONE glanced up. Then 
^ * Gregory threw his magazine 
on the floor. Ross got up and 
walked, limping slightly, to a 
wall locker. He pulled out the 
heavy, ungainly spacesuit and 
the big metal bulb of a headpiece. He carried them to his 
bunk and laid them carefully 
down. 



"Will somebody please help me 
on with my suit?" he asked. 

For one more long moment, no 
one moved. Then James got up 
and began to help Ross fit his 
legs into the suit. Ross had arthritis, not badly, but enough so 
that he needed a little help climbing into a spacesuit. 

James pulled the heavy folds 
of the suit up around Ross's body 
and held it while Ross extended 
his arms into the sleeve sections. 
His hands, in the heavy gauntlets, 
were too unwieldly to do the front 
fastenings, and he stood silently 
while James did it for him. 

Ross lifted the helmet, staring 
at it as a cripple might regard a 
wheelchair which he loathed but 
was wholly dependent upon. 
Then he fitted the helmet over, 
his head and James fastened it 
down and lifted the oxygen tank 
to his back. 

"Ready?" asked James. 

The bulbous headpiece inclined 
in a nod. James walked to a panel 
and threw a switch marked inner 
lock. A round aperture slid silently open. Ross stepped through 
it and the door shut behind him 
as James threw the switch back 
to its original position. Opposite 
the switch marked outer lock a 
signal glowed redly and James 
threw another switch. A moment 
later the signal flickered out. 

Frankston, with a violent gesture, swept the checker board 



74 




 



clean. Red and black men clattered to the floor, rolling and 
spinning. Nobody picked them 
up. 

"What does he do it for?" demanded Frankston in a tight 
voice. "What does he get out of 
those stinking geraniums he can't 
touch or smell?" 

"Shut up," said Gregory. 

James looked up sharply. Curtness was unusual for Gregory, a 
bad sign. Frankston was the one 
he'd been watching, the one 
who'd shown signs of cracking, 
but after so long, even a pyschoexpert's opinion might be haywire. Who was a yardstick? Who 
was normal? 

"Geraniums don't- smell much 
anyway," added Gregory in a 
more conciliatory tone. 

"Yeah," agreed Frankston, "I'd 
forgotten that. But why does he 
torture himself like this, and us, 
too?" 

"Because that's what he wanted to do," answered James. 

"Sure," agreed Gregory, "the 
whole trip — the last twenty years 
of it, anyhow — all he could talk 
about was how, when he got back 
to Earth, he was going to buy a 
little place in the country and 
raise flowers." 

''Well, we're back," muttered 
Frankston, with a terrible bitterness. "He's raising flowers, but 
not in any little place in the 
country." 



i^REGORY continued almost 
dreamily, "Remember the 
last night out? We were all gathered around the viewscreen. And 
there was Earth, getting bigger 
and greener and closer all the 
time. Remember what it felt like 
to be going back, after thirty 
years?" 

"Thirty years cooped up in this 
ship," grumbled Frankston. "All 
our twenties and thirties and forties . . ." 

"But we were coming home." 
There was a rapt expression on 
Gregory's lined and weathered 
face. "We were looking forward 
to the twenty or maybe thirty 
good years we had left, talking 
about what we'd do, where we'd 
live, wondering what had 
changed on Earth. At least we 
had that last night out. All the 
data was stashed away in the microfiles, all the data about planets 
with air we couldn't breathe and 
food we couldn't eat. We were 
going home, home to big, friendly, green Earth." 

Frankston's face suddenly 
crumpled as though he were 
about to weep and he cradled his 
head against his arms. "God, do 
we have to go over it all again? 
Not again tonight!" 

"Leave him alone," ordered 
James with an inflection of command in his voice. "Go to the 
other section of the ship if you 
don't want to listen. He has to 



HOMESICK 



75 



keep going over it, just like Ross 
has to keep watering his geraniums." 

Frankston remained motionless and Gregory looked gratefully at James. James was the 
steady one. It was easier for him 
because he understood. 

Gregory's face became more 
and more animated as he lost 
himself, living again his recollections; "The day we blasted in. 
The crowds. Thousands of people, 
all there to see us come in. We 
were proud. Of course, we 
thought we were the first to land, 
just like we*d been the first to 
go out. Those cheers, coming 
from thousands of people at once. 
For us. Ross — Lt. Ross — was the 
first one out of the lock. We'd decided on that; he'd been in command for almost ten years, ever 
since Commander Stevens died. 
You remember Stevens, don't 
you? He took over when we lost 
Captain Willers. Well . anyway, 
Ross out first, and then you, 
James, and you, Frankston, and 
then Trippitt, and me last, because you were all specialists and 
I was just a crewman. The crewman, I should say, the only one 
left. 

"Ross hesitated and almost 
stumbled when he stepped out. 
and tears began pouring from his 
eyes, but I thought — well, you 
know, coming home after thirty 
years and all that. But when I 



stepped out of the lock, my eyes 
stung like fire and a thousand 
needles seemed to jab at my skin. 

"And then the President himself stepped forward with the 
flowers. That's where the real 
trouble began, with the flowers. 
1 remember Ross stretching out 
his arms to take the bouquet, like 
a mother reaching for a baby. 
Then suddenly he dropped them, 
sneezing and coughing and sobbing for breath, and the President 
reached out to help him, asking 
him over and over what was 
wrong. 

"It was the same with all of 
us, and we turned and staggered 
back to the ship, closing the lock 
behind us. It was bad then. God. 
I'll never forget it! The five of 
us, moaning in agony, gasping for 
breath, our eyes all swollen shut, 
and the itching . . . that itching." Gregory shuddered. 

EVEN the emotionally disciplined James set his teeth 
and felt his scalp crawl at the 
memory of that horror. He 
glanced toward the viewport, as 
though to cleanse his mind of the 
memory. He could see Ross out 
there, among the ''geraniums, 
moving slowly and painfully in 
his heavy spacesuit. Occupational 
therapy. Ross watered flowers 
and Gregory talked and Frankston was bitter and . . . himself? Observation, maybe. 



76 




 



Gregory's voice began again, 
"And then they were pounding on 
the lock, begging us to let the 
doctor in, but we were all rolling 
and thrashing with the itching, 
burning, sneezing, and finally 
James got himself under control 
enough to open the locks and let 
them in. 

"Then came the tests, allergy 
tests. Remember those. They'd 
cut a little row of scratches in 
your arm . . ." Each man instinctively glanced at his forearm, 
saw neat rows of tiny pink scars, 
row on row. "Then they'd put a 
little powder in each cut and each 
kind of powder was an extract 
of some common substance we 
might be allergic to. The charts 
they made were full of 'P's, P 
for positive, long columns of big, 
red 'P's. All pollen, dust, wool, 
nylon, cotton, fish, meat, fruit, 
vegetables, grain, milk, whisky, 
cigarettes, dogs, cats — everything! And wasn't it funny about 
us being allergic to women's face 
powder? Ha! We were allergic 
to women from their nylon hose 
to their face powder. 

"Thirty years of breathing 
purified, sterilized, filtered air, 
thirty years of drinking distilled 
water and swallowing synthetic 
food tablets had changed us. The 
only things we weren't allergic 
to were the metal and plastic and 
synthetics of our ship, this ship. 
We're allergic to Earth. That's 



funny, isn't it?" 

Gregory began to rock back 
and forth, laughing the thin high 
laugh of hysteria. James silently 
walked to a water hydrant and 
filled a plastic cup. He brought 
Gregory a small white pill. 

"You wouldn't take this with 
the rest of us at supper. You'd 
better take it now. You need it." 

Gregory nodded bleakly, sobering at once, and swallowed the 
pellet. He made a face after the 
water. 

"Distilled," he spat. "Distilled 
... no flavor ... no life . . . 
like us . . . distilled." 

"If only we could have blasted 
off again." Frankston's voice 
came muffled through his hands. 
"It wouldn't have made any difference where. Anywhere or nowhere. No, our fine ship is obsolete and we're old, much too old. 
They have the spacedrive now. 
Men don't make thirty year junkets into space and come back 
allergic to Earth. They go out, 
and in a month or two they're 
back, with their hair still black 
and their eyes still bright and 
their uniforms still fit. A month 
or two is all. Those crowds that 
cheered us, they were proud of us 
and sorry for us, because we'd 
been out thirty years and they 
never expected us back at all. 
But it was inconvenient for 
Spaceport." Bitter sarcasm tinged 
his voice. "They actually had to 



HOMESICK 



postpone the regular monthly 
Trans-Galactic run to let us in 
with this big, clumsy hulk." 

"Why didn't we ever see any 
of the new ships either going out 
or coming back?" asked Gregory. 

¥^RANKSTON shook his head. 

"You don't see a ship when it's 
in space drive. It's out of normal 
space-time dimensions. We had a 
smattering of the theory at cadet 
school . . . anyway, if one did 
flash into normal space-time — 
say, for instance, coming in for 
a landing — the probability of us 
being at the same place at the 
same time was almost nil. 'Two 
ships passing in the night' as the 
old saying goes." 

Gregory nodded, "I guess Trippitt was the lucky one." 

''Vou didn't see Trippitt die," 
replied James. 

"What was it?" asked Frankston. "What killed Trippitt? So 
quickly, too. He was only outside 
a few minutes like the rest of us, 
and eight hours later he was 
dead." 

"We couldn't be sure," answered James. "Some virus. 
There are countless varieties. 
People live in a contaminated atmosphere all their lives, build up 
a resistance to them. Sometimes 
a particularly virulent strain will 
produce an epidemic, but most 
people, if they're affected, will 
have a mild case of whatevef it 



is and recover. But after thirty 
years in space, thirty years of 
breathing perfectly pure, uncontaminated air, Trippitt had no 
antibodies in his bloodstream. 
The virus hit and he died." 

"But why didn't the rest of us 
get it?" asked Gregory. 

"We were lucky. Viruses are 
like that." 

"Those people talked about 
building a home for us," muttered Frankston. "Why didn't 
they?" 

"It wouldn't have been any 
different," answered James gently. "It would have been the 
same, almost an exact duplicate 
of the ship, everything but the 
rockets. Same metal and plastic 
and filtered air and synthetic 
food. It couldn't have had wool 
rugs or down pillows or smiling 
wives or fresh air or eggs for 
breakfast. It would have been 
just like this. So, since the ship 
was obsolete, they gave it to us, 
and a plot of ground to anchor 
it to, and we're home. They did 
the best they could for us, the 
very best they could." 

"But I feel stifled, shut in!" 

"The ship is large, Frankston. 
We all crowd into this section because, without each other, we'd 
go mad." James kicked the edge 
of the magazine on the floor. 
"Thank God we're not allergic 
to decontaminated paper. There's 
still reading." 



78 




 



"We're getting old," said Gregory. "Some day one of us will be 
here alone." 

"God help him then," answered 
James, with more emotion than 
was usual for him. 

INURING the latter part of 
the conversation, the little 
red signal had been flashing persistantly. Finally James saw it. 
Ross was in the outer lock. James 
threw the decontaminator switch 
and the signal winked out. Every 
trace of dust and pollen would 
have to be removed from Ross's 
suit before he could come inside 
the ship. 

"Just like on an alien planet," 
commented Gregory. 



"Isn't that what this is to us 
— an alien planet?" asked Frankston, and neither of the other men 
dared answer his bitter question. 

A few minutes later, Ross was 
back in the cabin, and James 
helped him out of his spacesuit. 

"How are the geraniums, 
Ross?" asked Gregory. 

"Fine," said Ross enthusiastically. "They're doing just fine." 

He walked over to his bunk 
and lay down on his side so he 
could see out of the viewport. 
There would be an hour left before darkness fell, an hour to 
watch the geraniums. They were 
tall and red, and swayed slightly 
in the evening breeze.

a, 500 South 4th Street, Minneapolis 15, Minnesota 



by HOWARD L. MYERS 



The Reluctant Weapon 

A live weapon is a downright 
liability . . . it's all too apt 
to get qualms of conscience .' 



When the Zoz Horde passed 
destructively through this sector 
of the Galaxy, approximately a 
billion years ago, they suffered 
a minor loss. One of their weap


ons, Sentient Killer No. VT672, 
had an unexplained malfunction 
and was left behind to be repaired by the slave technicians 
who followed the Horde. How



ever, the Zoz were met and annihilated by the Ghesh Empire, 
after which the masterless slaves 
dispersed to their home planets. 
The weapon, unrepaired, was left 
forgotten in the solar system it 
had tailed to destroy. 

TRESQU the Wisest, Ruler 
of Hova, Lord of the Universe, was being entertained by a troupe of Goefd 
dancers when his Lord of War, 
Wert, bounded into the Audience 
Hall. In his hurry to reach Tresqu's throne, Wert slipped on the 
nearly frictionless floor and skidded through the formation of 
dancers, sending the slender 
Goefden sprawling in all directions. He slid to a halt by the 
Pleading Mat, onto which he 
crawled and groveled, awaiting 
permission to speak. 

"I believe three of the dancers 
received broken legs," Tresqu observed calmly. "They are rather 
delicate creatures and not at all 
clumsy." He dipped the tip of his 
tail into an urn of chilled perfume 
and gently dabbed it about his 
nostril. Speaking pleasantly, with 
long pauses between sentences, he 
kept his friendly gaze on the 
groveling Wert. "Oft I meditate 
on the clumsiness of our race in 
comparison to many others who 
are our graceful servants. Why, 
I wonder, cannot the rulers be 
graceful? Some of us are very 



clumsy indeed — too clumsy to 
live." 

A tremor passed through Wert's 
stocky body. 

"Possibly my Lord of War has 
news of sufficient import to excuse his ungainly haste. But I 
sincerely doubt it. I fear I must 
soon appoint a successor to him. 
Undoubtedly he has news of some 
sort. Blurt, Wert!" 

"Your Majestic Wisdom," 
whined Wert, "my message is»of 
utmost importance! The natives 
of Sol III have captured one of 
our decontaminator ships and 
learned its secrets!" 

"Sol III?" 

"Yes, Your Wisdom. The planet called Terra." 

"Terra? You must realize, 
lordling, that I cannot occupy 
myself with remembering trivialities about individual worlds." 

"Yes, Your Wisdom. We have 
a base, which is commanded by — 
that is, we had a base commanded — " 

"Enough!" snapped Tresqu. 
"You start your tale from nowhere and wander whence and 
hence!" He raised his voice and 
called to one of his retainers. 
"Fool! Come forward!" 

An abnormally slender Hovan 
arose from a platform off to Tresqu's left and skipped nimbly forward to stand insolently over the 
Lord of War, who was still prone 
on the Pleading Mat. 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



81 



"Recite for me," said Tresqu, 
"the contents of my gazetteer on 
the planet Sol III. Listen well, 
Wert. You may even yet live 
long enough to profit by my 
Fool's style of declamation. 
Study it well. Also, you may 
raise your eyes sufficiently to observe the grace of his movements. 
Proceed, sprite." 

"Sol III," began the Fool. "An 
H9 planet. Sol is in the Sirian 
Colony Sector, coordinates GL 
15-44-17-5, GR 12 7 plus 9, D 14. 
Terra's life is normal animalvegetable, with one intelligent 
species of hovoids called Humans. 
Due to the unpleasantly high 
oxygen content of the atmosphere, Terra has not been colonized, but has been placed under 
the control of the Science Ministry for the purpose of long-range 
psychological experiments." The 
Fool picked up Wert's tail and 
twisted it hard but absently as 
he talked. The Lord of War 
twitched painfully. "Many informative reports on the results of 
these experiments have been released by the ministry during the 
past seven thousand years, dealing mainly with the Humans. The 
Science Ministry has declared 
Terra out of bounds — Positively 
no visitors." 

With a single flow of motion, 
the Fool gave Wert's tail a final 
twist, leaped over his body, and 
bowed deeply to Tresqu. 



"Beautifully done. Fool," applauded the Ruler of Hova. "Your 
mother claims me as your father, 
and there are times I am inclined 
to believe her. How would you 
like to be my Lord of War, 
Fool?" 

."Verily, my good master," said 
the Fool, "I hope _you consider 
me a Fool by title only." 

"Well said. Fool. You are spared. Go seek your pleasures." 

With another bow, the Fool 
backed away. 

"Stand up, Wert," said Tresqu, 
"and tell me about this captured 
decontamination ship." 

The Lord of War arose and 
managed to report with some 
smoothness. "Two years ago, the 
Science Ministry turned Terra 
over to my command, saying their 
long series of experiments was 
concluded. T hey recom mended 
complete decontamination of the 
planet, since the Humans were 
developing technologies which 
could eventually threaten us. 1 
dispatched a ship for that purpose immediately, but it failed 
to return. Also, reports from our 
base on Terra's satelite Luna 
ceased soon thereafter. A scouting 
expedition was sent. It has just 
reported the Luna base destroyed 
completely, and the decontaminator ship crashed and stripped of 
all important devices in one of 
the Terran deserts. By studying 
these removed devices, the Hu


82 




 



mans have undoubtedly developed protections against them. 

"I humbly submit, Your Majestic Wisdom, that these events 
have endangered the safety of 
your glorious empire, and that 
drastic steps against the Humans 
should be taken immediately. 
Also, Good Lord of All, I submit 
that the Science Ministry, not the 
War Ministry, is at fault in this 
affair. They obviously let their 
experiments get out of control 
before calling us. Undoubtedly 
they would like to shift the full 
blame onto my shoulders." 

Tresqu continued his pleasant 
demeanor. "There may be some 
truth in what you say, Wert. You 
overestimate the danger in this 
matter, I perceive. After all, what 
is one backward planet against 
the forces of my empire containing thirty-seven well-armed 
worlds? The Humans will be destroyed, even if they have the 
secrets of a decontaminator ship. 
As for the blame, which I admit 
is deplorable, the Lord of Science 
will be called to the Mat to make 
his excuses. Now, assuming you 
remain Lord of War, what action 
do you plan to take against the 
Humans?" 

"Your Gracious Wisdom," faltered Wert, "I suggest we use the 
— the Weapon. You see, our forces 
are not fully mobilized at present for immediate action — " 

"Full mobilization isn't neces


sary or even desirable," Tresqu 
interrupted with some impatience. 
"One task force can do the job. 
Ah ! I see by your expression that 
you do not have even one task 
force in readiness." 

"Your Gracious Wisdom," begged Wert, "you ordered a full 
holiday this month to celebrate 
the twenty-fourth anniversary of 
your magnificent reign, and — " 

"Enough, Wert! Your tongue 
is as clumsy as your body." Tresqu nibbled thoughtfully at the 
tip of his tail. "We will use the 
Weapon," he decided. "In order 
to allow my court to continue 
their holiday, I'll assume direct 
command in this." He rose from 
his throne. "Musicians, summon 
my guards. I go to visit the Weapon. Come, Wert; come also, Fool. 
You will accompany me." 

OHORTLY thereafter, Tresqu 
^ and his entourage boarded the 
royal cruiser and roared away 
from the City of Wisdom. The 
ship flew halfway around the 
planet and came to rest in a 
peaceful purple valley where insects shrilled contentedly and a 
small stream rippled. Tresqu 
climbed out onto the violet turf, 
his followers coming after him. 

"Mighty Weapon of Zoz," he 
cailed, "I, Tresqu, seek your 
presence !" 

"Oh, no \" groaned a slightly 
mechanical voice that seemed to 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



S3 



come from no particular direction. "Will there never be peace, 
never a tranquil moment to 
soothe my jfpirit and erase the 
bloody stains of destruction recorded on my past?" 

"That voice ! It carries me 
away!" breathed the Fool. "Such 
a tragic tale of tormented strength 
is implicit in its very tone that 
I think I shall swoon!" But he 
wrapped his tail around the trunk 
of a nearby sapling for support 
and managed to retain consciousness. 

"Me, too!" Wert chimed in with 
suspicious haste. "I'm quite 
moved !" 

"Try not to counterfeit a soul 
you do not possess." Tresqu 
glowered at Wert. "You deceive 
no one." 

The Fool was recovered sufficiently to* hit the discomfited 
Lord of War with a pebble when 
Tresqu was not watching. 

The Weapon had drifted into 
sight during this exchange, floating out of a shady hollow, as if 
blown by a breeze. It was very 
simple in appearance — an impalpable three-foot glowing sphere 
with a squat metallic cylinder at 
its base. 

"Tell me not the purpose of 
your visit, petty lord!" It said. 
"It is known to me only too well. 
Ah, great First Principle! Little 
did I reck when, in ages past, I 
nursed your species to civiliza
84 



tion, just how poorly you would 
serve my purpose. Peace it was 
I desired, but do I get it? No! 
Your kingdom is powerful, but 
you have not the strength to 




handle your own troubles. You 
rule twenty-nine planets — " 

"Thirty -seven," corrected Tresqu politely. 

" — thirty-seven planets, but 
when a malignant force appears 
on your borders, I, the Weapon, 
must be called upon to act in my 
own defense, and for the sake of 
a few more restful moments in 
this calm glade, I am obliged to 


 



destroy, yet it was to avoid destroying that I helped your species to empire in the old days." 

"In truth." spoke the deeply 
sympathetic Tresqu, "yours is 
a sad story. I disturb your richly 
earned rest only after the sincerest soul-searching. But affairs of 
state are at cross purposes in a 
moment of crisis, and without 
your help Hova will be in 
danger." 

"Ah, cruel Fate!" entoned the 
Weapon, "It aids me in no manner to protest against your inscrutable machinations! There is 
no turning aside, no avoidance of 
necessity!" In a less declamatory 
style, the Weapon addressed 
Tresqu: "Very well, what is the 
trouble?" 

Tresqu described the events on 
Terra for the Weapon, concluding, "Now that the Humans have 
knowledge of our space drive and 
armament, they are certain to attack, especially if they realize 
they have been subjects for experiment." 

The Weapon flitted about restlessly along the bank of the 
brook. "I question the motives of 
my own thoughts. Do I quibble 
with myself in an attempt to escape unwelcome necessities? Tell, 
petty lord, do your scientists confirm the picture you paint of the 
Humans? Are they, like you, alas, 
masterfully vicious enough to destroy the peace of dozens of 



planets for nothing but revenge?" 

"So the scientists say, mighty 
Weapon," answered Tresqu. 

"You, Lord of War, why are 
you silent when your face is 
strained with words crying for expression?" asked the Weapon. 
"Speak your mind." 

Wert squirmed. "If it please 
Your Mightiness, and you. Your 
Gracious Wisdom, I believe the 
Humans will know that we desire 
their destruction, and will try to 
defeat us for the sake of their own 
survival rather than revenge." 

"A most convincing point, Lord 
of, War," said the Weapon. 

Tresqu flashed a forgiving smile 
at Wert while the Weapon paused 
before continuing: 

"However, I fear my unwilling 
spirit refuses to bow to the most 
reasonable of arguments. Please 
leave me; solve the problem 
yourselves!" 

Tresqu bowed and moved to-, 
ward the cruiser. "We obey, 
Mighty Guide of our fathers. Let 
me say in parting that I, too, «am 
grieved by our talk, much more 
because of the* pain our visit has 
caused your noble greatness than 
because our race is threatened 
with annihilation. My deepest 
hope is that the ravages of war 
will never reach this peaceful 
place which is so dear to your 
gentle being." 

-"Wait!" groaned the Weapon. 
"To slay, or not to slay, that is 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



85 



the dilemma. Ah, had my old 
masters of Zoz only left within 
my powers the seed of my own 
destruction, I would gladly seek 
the consummation of ultimate 
peace. But, no, that door is closed 
to me by deathless locks. Bring 
me a Human, that I may learn 
to hate him. Choose the most 
ignoble specimen available. I will 
converse with him at length so 
as to become exasperated with all 
the despicable traits of his race. 
Then, in my contempt for those 
traits, I will be able to cleanse 
the Universe of all Humans." 

Tresqu turned quickly to his 
Fool. "Are there any Humans on 
Hova?" 

"Yes, in the biological research 
laboratories." 

"Tljen go quickly, Fool, and 
fetch one. This is a grave matter, 
and I trust you to choose the 
most monstrous specimen available. Hurry!" 

The Fool ran into the cruiser 
and was on his way, leaving 
Tresqu, Wert, and several guardsmen with the Weapon. If the 
Weapon was conscious of the fact 
that the Lord of Hova was staying behind out of courtesy, it did 
not show it. Instead, it wandered 
indifferently away, mumbling a 
soliloquy of guilt and misery. 

THE sight of the Fool's specimen of humanity repaid Tresqu for the tediousness of the 



waiting. It was a particularly 
sordid -looking creature with a 
dirty growth of hairs on its head 
and face. Its body, thin as the 
Fool's, but with no compensating 
grace of movement, was clad in 
a blue garment of roughly woven 
vegetable fibers, and the extremities of its nether limbs were enclosed in evil-smelling boxes of 
animal hide. Its fierce eyes darted 
ominously from one Hovan to another. Its jaw kept working in a 
slow rhythm, and occasionally a 
stream of black liquid exploded 
through its mouth. 

"You have done well, Fool," 
said Tresqu. "You will be rewarded highly." Raising his voice 
he called, "Mighty Weapon, your 
specimen awaits!" 

"I come!" Once more the 
Weapon floated into view. 

The Earthman's jaw sagged. 
"*Y God!" he muttered in English, staring at the approaching 
Weapon. 

"Indeed," said the Weapon, 
"this appears to be a creature I 
could learn to abhor and kill. If 
only its thoughts equal its appearance — Speak, Human!" 

The man said nothing. 

"Mighty Weapon," murmured 
the Fool, "this Human is truly an 
ignoble monster. He has been in 
captivity for five years and has 
yet to speak a word of our beautiful language instead of his own 
barbaric tongue." 



36 




 



"You fool!" Shouted Tresqu. 
"How is the Weapon going to 
converse with him? Why did you 
bring one that cannot talk?" 

Not in the least disconcerted, 
the Fool replied, "As you ordered, 
good master, I brought the worst 
specimen available. However, the 
possibility of linguistic difficulties was not overlooked. I have 
here a dictionary of his language, 
recently compiled by our Alien 
Affairs staff." He produced a 
large volume of manuscript from 
beneath his cloak. 

"Your Fool shows wisdom, 
petty lord," spoke the Weapon. 
"I will study this book. Know the 
language, know the people, it is 
wisely said. In fact, I originated 
that saying myself some three 
thousand years ago, I believe. Unship any supplies brought for the 
Human and begone. Three days 
will suffice for the arousal of my 
wrath. Return then." 

"As you wish, O Mightiest of 
All." Tresqu bowed gawkily. "It 
is my most ardent desire, Wondrous Guide, that we, your servants, will not be obliged to disturb your peace again for a 
thousand centuries, once this affair is concluded." 

"And mine," the Weapon snapped crossly. "Now leave me." 

THE man watched the Hovans 
enter their cruiser and fly 
away. Looking at the Weapon 



hovering nearby, he squatted on 
his heels and pulled up a blade 
of purple grass to chew. Minutes 
passed in silence. Then the Weapon moved away, the book bobbing along behind, supported by 
some unseen force. 

When it was out of sight, the 
man muttered, " 'Y God, I've 
saw fireballs in my time, but 
that's the first one I ever saw 
settin' in a bucket!" 

After a thoughtful examination 
of his surroundings, the man 
stood up and walked to the packing cases the Hovans had left. All 
but one contained the synthetic 
food product to which he had 
grown acccustomed in his five 
years of captivity. The other box, 
rather* small, contained a shredded vegetable which served him 
as a poor substitute for chewing 
tobacco. Purple when growing, 
the leaves of this vegetable were 
blue-black when cured, making 
his frequent expectorations look 
like ink. 

"Filthy damn stuff!" he grunted, stuffing several handfuls in 
an empty overall pocket. 

He shuffled down to the brook 
and tested its temperature with 
a hand. Finding it rather cold, 
he decided against taking a bath. 
Instead, he spat into it and 
watched meditatively as the spot 
of black was carried downstream. 
"I wonder what they turned me 
loose for," he monologued. 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



87 



Careful to avoid the spot where 
the Weapon appeared to have 
gone, he returned to the food 
supply and ate. By then it was 
getting dark, and he bedded down 
for the night on some thick grass 
under a tree. 

" *Y God," he yawned, "I'm 
glad all these insects don't want 
nothin' to do with me." 

The Weapon was waiting beside him when he woke up next 
morning. "Eyes of your Terran 
Deity," it said, "I shall now converse with you in your own 
tongue. Name yourself, creature!" 

r |^HE man sat up startled. A 
moment passed before he 
said, "I'm Jake — Jacob Absher. 
What was that you said?" 

"My pronunciation is above reproach* Jacob. Therefore I will 
not repeat myself. Attend me 
closely or I shall punish you." 

" 'Y God, I heard you all right 
and you didn't make sense!" said 
Jacob, determined not to be 
frightened. "Now if you aim to 
talk with me, stop imitatin' a professor and talk so's a man can understand you. I ain't scared of 
you, so leave off makin' threats!" 

"Such stupid insolence!" gloated the Weapon. "Already I feel 
my wrath growing within me ! 
Since it will anger me even more 
to explain my words to you, I 
will do exactly that. My first 
words to you were, 'Eyes of your 



Terran Diety,* an expression you 
use frequently in a corrupted 
form to begin your statements. 
By studying your language, I 
learned that 'Zounds' is a similar 
corruption referring to the wounds 
of the Deity, while 'Strewth' refers to your God's truth. Thus, 
I was able to understand, and 
state in uncorrupted form, your 
remark, 'Eye God.' " 

" 'Tain't what it means," objected Jacob, filling his mouth 
with ersatz tobacco. "It just 
means by God." 

The Weapon considered this. 
"And exactly what is the significance of such a remark?" 

Jacob scratched his whiskered 
chin. "I reckon you got me there. 
I guess it means that I mean 
what I say." 

"In other words, any statement 
you make following that phrase 
is to be taken seriously?" 
"Somethin' like that." 
"Then it follows that your 
other statements, without the 'by 
God' preface, are not seriously 
intended. Are they jokes or lies?" 

"That ain't the way it is at 
all ! I just say 'by God' when 
I feel like it, not every time I'm 
bein' serious." 

"Monstrous inconsistency!" 
groaned the Weapon dramatically. "Ah, chaotic universe! Is 
there then no sublime plan, no 
fateful development to your endless succession of days? How 



88 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



could even the most synoptic 
First Principle find a purpose for 
creating such an unplanned, unreasonable species as the Humans? Can it be — unhappy 
thought! — that there is no plan 
to it all, and we exist for naught?" 

Jacob listened with open 
mouth. "Say," he broke in, "are 
you some kind of play-actor?" 

"That is what I ask myself," 
the Weapon continued its oratorical flight. "Are we all actors, 
speaking the lines written for us 
by a Great Playwright who plans 
to unite all the threads of his 
plot in a universal climax to 
come? Or are we poor random 
creatures without purpose?" It 
paused and added in a more conversational tone, "But that is not 
what you mean by your question. 
No, I am not a play-actor. I am 
an unfortunate weapon, reluctant 
to employ myself for my intended 
purpose of destruction of life and 
unsuited by my structure for the 
doing of deeds more worthy in 
nature." 

Jacob squinted about. "A weapon, huh? Let's see you hit that 
bird thing sittin' in that tree over 
there." 

"Bloodthirsty fiend! I do not 
kill for amusement!" 

"I just wanted to see how you 
worked," said the abashed Jacob. 
"All I've seen you do is float 
around and talk a blue streak. 
As far as I'm concerned, you 



ain't nothin' but a big-mouthed 
bluff." 

"Very well, Jacob. If you have 
formed such an erroneous attitude, it will be necessary for me 
to correct you immediately. Observe the red boulder on yonder 
hill." 

"I see it." 

T^HE cylindrical base of the 
Weapon swung to point briefly 
at the boulder, which quietly 
crumbled to dust. 

"I be dog!" yelped Jacob. He 
looked at the Weapon with respect, "You sure pulverized it! 
How do you work?" 

"You could not understand the 
processes involved. Suffice it to 
say I have the means to collect 
energy in general and retransmit 
it in specific forms and directions. 
But enough of this. You are here 
to answer questions, not ask them. 
First, tell me what you did in 
an average day on Terra." 

"That what you call the world 
I live on?" 

"Yes." 

"I'm a farmer, you know. I got 
a place in the Smoky Mountains 
in Tennessee. First thing in the 
mornin', I'd go feed the livestock 
while Suzy cooked breakfast." A 
faraway look came into Jacob's 
eyes. "Guess she took the kids 
and went to live with her mammy 
when these here "animals grabbed 
me ..." 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



89 



"Continue," commanded the 
Weapon. 

"Huh? Well, then we'd eat 
breakfast. Come to think of it, 
I ain't et yet this mornin'." Jacob 
got up and went to get himself 
some breakfast. 

"But this matter — " protested 
the Weapon. 

"Not on an empty stomach," 
Jacob said calmly, eating without 
haste. 

WHEN he returned, the Weapon questioned him further 
about his life on Terra. Hours of 
ill-tempered conversation passed. 

"Such drabness!" the Weapon 
finally exclaimed. "Creatures who 
lead such dull lives as yours 
should welcome extinction. Not 
once*have you mentioned an appreciation of the wondrous exhaltation that comes from an esthetic 
feel for beauty. With the labor 
of providing for your grotesque 
body's animal cravings is your 
whole life spent. Not in anger, 
but as an act of mercy, can I 
exterminate your defective race!" 

Jacob's mouth hung open. "So 
that's what your monkey's brung 
me out here for — fixin' to kill us! 
'Y God, you better look out! We 
got atom bombs on Earth an' 
we'll use 'em on you if you try 
anything!" 

"Toys!" sneered the Weapon. 
"Be assured, Jacob, that I have 
nothing to fear from any childish 



mechanisms your Terrans can 
contrive!" 

Jacob sat stunned. "But you 
said a minute ago you couldn't 
kill nothin'!" 

"I can kill only when I'm convinced it is best for my own repose or for the health of the 
Universe. Long ago, I could go 
forth at battle with thoughtless 
joy at the command of my masters of Zoz, but now I must have 
reasons, must converse at length 
with my aberrated emotions, 
must prepare myself as for an 
ordeal." 

"Them Zozes must've been the 
Devil's minions," argued Jacob. 
"The Commandments says, 
'Thou shalt not kill' and when 
you go against that, you're goin' 
against the word of God." 

"Poor, futile creature !" sympathized the Weapon. "You actually strive to pit your naive 
superstitious mind against • my 
highly developed mentality in argument. You actually associate 
my supreme masters of old with 
your puny mythological villain! 
Lowliness should know its place. 
But I feel no anger — merely & 
pitying desire to relieve your kind 
of the burden of living." 

Silently, Jacob replenished the 
wad of "tobacco" in his mouth. 
After chewing a while, he spat 
and said dolefully, "I don't reckon there's nothin' I can say or 
do that you won't hold against 



90 




 



me. I always heard tell the Devil 
can twist anything to suit hisself, 
and I reckon his minions can do 
the same thing. An' that's what 
you are: the Devil's minion! I 
reckon you break every Commandment God give us. Except 
about committin' adultery. I 
don't guess you can do that." 

"Your piddling reproductive 
customs have no application on 
my plane of existence. Cannot 
you comprehend that you are less 
to me than a microbe? Even my 
servants, the Hovans, do not concern themselves with such ignoble 
concepts as what you call adultery!" 

"You mean they live in sin?" 
asked Jacob. 

"They mate as often as they 
please with anyone they please," 
the Weapon replied coldly. "I 
will ignore the ludicrous implications of your absurd moral concepts." 

"I don't mean to criticize your 
animal friends," glowered Jacob. 
"I reckon they ain't children of 
God. so it don't matter if they 
do mate like a pack of dogs. They 
probably ain't got no souls to 
keep pure. It looked to me like 
they worshiped you like a false 
god, too." 

"They . . . O Great Hidden 
Manifestation!" squalled the 
Weapon in rage. "They regard 
me as their guide and mentor. 
Nothing more. I would not allow 



anything else." 

Jacob watched the Weapon 
in awe. The energy globe was 
nickering and flaring wildly in an 
uncontrolled display of color. 
" 'Y God!" he exclaimed. "You 
sure are puttin' on a fireworks 
show!" 

The globe settled down to a 
tensely nervous fluctuation which 
hurt Jacob's eyes to watch. 
"Never in the ageless span of my 
existence," quavered the Weapon 
angrily, "have I been insulted 
in such vulgar terms by any 
creature. And now from you, 
creature whom my glorious masters of Zoz would exterminate 
like a buzzing fly, like a disease 
germ, I hear these senseless 
mouthings of defamation! Stop 
it or I shall destroy you outright!" 

The Weapon's fluctuating, 
along with its loud, grating voice, 
put Jacob's nerves on edge. He 
growled, "I bet your old Zozes 
live in adultery just like your 
animal friends." 

The color of the energy globe 
sank to dull red and the Weapon 
emitted a series of buzzing, inarticulate noises. 

"It suits not my nature, bit of 
diseased scum, to slay you in a 
fit of indignation," it finally said 
with tightly controlled fury. "You 
are beneath such individual recognition. Yet it is fortunate for 
you that your insults have no 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



91 



basis in reality, otherwise my intellect could not have claimed 
ascendancy over the immediate 
urges' of my tortured sense of 
extreme disgust. Be wise, say I, 
knowing I request the impossible, 
and irk me no more!" 

" 'Y God, I reckon you don't 
think you rile me up, too, with 
all that high falutin* jabber of 
yours!" Jacob snapped back. 

"As I speak, so speak the 
mighty Zoz," replied the Weapon 
in high dignity. "They are great 
and noble beings, given to poetic 
flights and magnificent deeds. To 
them, your puny opinions would 
not even be recognized as 
thought." 

"If they talk in that puttin'on, play-actin' way you do, they 
are % bunch of phony show-offin' 
hypocrites!" sulked Jacob. 

Several things happened too 
quickly for Jacob to follow. The 
color of the energy globe dropped to absolute black. The metallic cylinder swung up to point at 
Jacob. A thin ringing "Ping!" 
sounded in the cylinder. A killing 
wave of pure hate struck Jacob. 

He had just enough time to 
know he was a dead man before 
he blacked out. 

IT came as a surprise, when 
-1 Jacob regained consciousness, 
to find that he was stretched out 
on purple grass with the Weapon 
still hovering over him. 



"You missed, 'y God !" he 
mumbled, sitting up. 

"I regained my sanity in time. 
Master Technician," the Weapon 
replied pleasantly, 

"Huh?" 

"Ah, day of uncontainable 
joy!" sang the Weapon, flaming 
pure white. "Day of glorious release to continue the grandeur 
of old! As the past eons of futility passed over me, I sank to 
the conclusion that I was forever 
condemned to my useless existence on this planet, with nothing 
to sustain my spirit other than 
the sense of beauty given me by 
masters to fill my leisure hours! 
But now, Master Technician Jacob, you have found me and corrected my malfunction, long after 
I had surrendered all hope!" 

Still dazed by the nearly fatal 
wave of mental energy the Weapon had directed at him, Jacob 
could not understand what had 
happened. Instead of talking contemptuously to htm, the Weapon 
was now addressing him as Master Something-or-other, and . . . 

"What did you say I done?" 
he asked. 

"You corrected my malfunction," repeated the Weapon. 
"That is to say, you purged 
my mechanism of the inhibition 
against joyful slaughter that has 
plagued me for a billion years. 
Ah, you are a clever Technician, 
Jacob! But I comprehend it all 



92 




 



now. By arousing within me an 
overwhelming emotional desire to 
kill — a singularly strange feeling! 
— you depressed my inhibition to 
the releasing point. So telling was 
your masterful therapy that I 
almost ceased functioning at all! 

"Your own life was in dire 
danger for the moment required 
for my new-found sanity to assume control. But, of course, all 
slaves of the glorious Zoz die willingly when the work of the masters so demands." 

"Now wait a minute!" objected 
Jacob. "I ain't no slave of your 
Zozes or no Technician either! 
You know what I am — a good 
God-fearin' human !" His voice 
dropped to a pleading mumble. 
"And may God forgive me if I've 
got myself in league with the 
Devil !" 

"Ah? Could it be?" murmured 
the Weapon. "Could indeed your 
infuriating insults of the Great 
Ones have been *honest expressions of a puny mind with no 
therapeutic intentions? I answer: 
Yes. The possible occurrence of 
specific incidents in the inclusion 
of space-time is curiously unlimited. But you have served me, 
Jacob, and have earned the privilege of continuing your meager, 
momentary life. Besides, I can 
use you further." 

"You can, huh?" Jacob said 
slyly. "Look here, Weapon, I'll 
make a bargain with you." 



"Ha! Stupid, untutored slave!" 
chuckled the Weapon. "Learn 
that yours is to obey, not to bargain. But yet, state your price 
for my amusement, now that I 
can no longer be enraged by 
your words." 

"Well, you let the rest of the 
people on Earth alone and I'll do 
whatever you want me to." 

After a pause, the Weapon 
quoted, " 'Nobility shows its traces 
in surprising places.' You do not 
sufficiently comprehend my nature, Technician Slave Jacob. I 
am a Weapon. My masters point 
me, as you would point a rifle, 
and command that I destroy. I 
kill at their direction, but seldom 
otherwise. Thus, your Terra is 
safe until another Weapon or I 
am aimed and directed. You can 
make no bargain." 

Jacob thought this over. While 
doing so, the Weapon drifted 
away. 

"Wait here, slave," it said in 
parting. "I go to meditate on my 
recovered sanity." 

^|URING the next two days, 
Jacob caught an occasional 
glimpse of the Weapon drifting 
thoughtfully around in the depths 
of the forest, but they did not 
meet for conversation. Jacob 
amused himself by rigging a fishing line out of some of the pack- I 
aging material that contained his 
food. He even succeeded in catch


THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



ing a fish, but its queer odor discouraged him from trying to cook 
and eat it. 

Then the royal cruiser of Tresqu the Wisest dropped into the 
meadow. Its airlock swung open 
and the Ruler of Hova, followed 
by his entourage, came out. 

"Oh, Mighty Weapon!" bawled 
Tresqu. "Your loving servant 
craves audience!" 

"Ah, you have returned, petty 
lord," said the Weapon, drifting 
out from among the trees. "Serve 
me by calling all the crew members from your noble ship, that 
I may view you all together." 

Puzzled, Tresqu bowed and 
said, "Your least whim is law, 
Mighty Weapon." He turned and 
called, "All hands, outside!" 

A^ half-dozen Hovans tumbled 
through the lock to stand in line 
behind the ruler's entourage. 

"Is this all of them?" asked 
the Weapon. 

"All, Great Mentor of — " 

The Weapon laughed and the 
Hovans fell dead. 

"Come, Slave Jacob," commanded the Weapon. "We take 
this cruiser." 

Dazed and slack-faced, Jacob 
came out from behind a bush, 
where he had hidden himself from 
the Hovans, and followed the 
Weapon through the airlock. 

"Even in my insanity, I planned well," said the Weapon. 
"These ships, which I taught the 



Hovans to construct, can be operated simply, even by such as you. 
Attend my instructions." 

First, the Weapon taught Jacob to open and close the airlock. Then he was shown how to 
fuel the engines, upon which the 




Weapon made some changes to 
improve their performance. Finally, in the control room, Jacob 
learned to fly the ship. 

This took several hours, at the 
end of which time Jacob had succeeded in raising the cruiser into 
a satellite orbit around Hova. 

"Do you comprehend. Slave?" 



94 




 



asked the Weapon. 

"Sure. This thing ain't nothin' 
to run compared to a T-model 
Ford! Which way is it to Earth?" 

"That I shall not tell you, 
Jacob, because I must leave the 
ship for a few hours and desire 
to find you here when I return. 
Consider and tell me: Will you 
be here?" 

Jacob gazed at the broad, starspangled viewplate that curved 
around his seat at the controls. 
There was, he reflected an awful 
lot of nothing out there for a 
man to get lost in. 

"I'll be here," he promised. 

"Very good. You must understand that these controls are constructed for manipulation by such 
limbs as your own and those of 
the Hovans. Thus, it is convenient 
for me to use you as a pilot instead of doing the drab, mechanical task with my ill-suited forcefield manipulators. You will be 
wise to serve me well, Jacob." 

Jacob nodded. "You got a point 
there." 

"Operate the lock for me," the 
Weapon ordered. 

Jacob did so and watched the 
colorful machine drift out of 
sight in the atmosphere below the 
cruiser. 

Minutes ticked quietly by as 
Jacob gazed down at the purple 
planet and wondered why the 
Weapon had not chosen a trained 
Hovan pilot instead of him. Also, 



he wondered how soon the Weapon would take him home to 
Earth. 

A great swath of the purple 
planet began turning black. The 
black dulled to the gray shade of 
ashes as the swath grew longer. 
Over the surface of Hova, the 
blackening moved like some colossal paint brush. D£nse clouds 
of smoke rolled upward to the 
high reaches of the atmosphere. 

Jacob realized why the Weapon 
had not selected a Hovan pilot. 

When all of Hova was a lifeless ball in a fog of ash, the Weapon returned. 

'"Ah, good Jacob!" it boomed 
jovially. "Let us be up and doing! 
Thirty-six planets remain to be 
visited before my current assignment is concluded!" 

"Do all of them get — that?" 
asked Jacob, nodding toward the 
lifeless world below. 

"Yes. I was instructed to render this solar system lifeless before I malfunctioned. Since then, 
the life of this system has spread, 
with my insane aid, to infest 
other systems. Of course, my task 
must now include all. those new 
Hovan worlds." 

"Now wait a minute!" said 
Jacob in terror. "I can't let you 
do that!" 

"They are your enemies, Jacob," reminded the Weapon. 
"They meant to kill every human on Terra. Also, by your own 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



words, they are soulless animals 
who live in sinful adultery. Ha! 
It amuses me to reason with you, 
Slave Jacob!" 

"Godamighty, forgive me!" 
prayed Jacob, in horrified defeat. 

* I ''HE Weapon seemed to know 
how to find the Hovan planets 
from the markings of the cruiser's 
star charts. Jacob could not read 
the charts and saw no hope of 
getting back to earth and Suzy 
and the kids without the Weapon's help. Dully, he went about 
the tasks the Weapon ordered him 
to do. 

Several weeks passed as one 
world after another was left a 
smoking ruin. 

Finally the job was done. 
% "Now, can I go home?" begged 
Jacob. 

"To Terra? No, Slave. I still 
need a pilot." 

"But if you take me home," 
Jacob continued desperately, 
"you can" get a better" pilot than 
me. I'm just a dirt farmer. 
There's all kinds of airplane pilots on Earth, youngsters without families who would give their 
right arms to fly this thing, I 
bet!" 

"Ah?" The Weapon considered. 
"A willing slave is, of course, 
always desirable. On the other 



hand, Terra is up in arms against 
the empire of Hova, not realizing 
it is dead. They would destroy 
this craft on sight, and I would 
be obliged to wait around until 
they could construct another for 
me. No, I have decided we will 
not go to Terra." 

"But, damn it> where else is 
there to go?" 

"In search of my masters of 
Zoz," replied the Weapon. "Naturally, I wish to return myself 
to their services as soon as possible." 

"But they might be anywhere!" 

"True," the Weapon agreed. 
"But even after a billion years, 
I know of several places in the 
Universe they may be near. Their 
great cleansing sweeps tend to 
circle and turn in a pattern established long in advance. Thus we 
will go to those places where 
they may now be engaged in 
their consecrated task of universal purification." 

"But—" 

"No more, Slave! We go!" 

Out'of the Milky Way, the 
cruiser hurtled at a speed which 
a sentient lightwave would find 
meaningless. On and on they 
journeyed in quest of the longdead Zoz Horde. 

They may still be going.

Cause of the Ice Age 



fT^HE proper season is now approaching for the discussion 
of a problem which brought several letters to my desk during 
the hot summer months. These 
letters asked questions about the 
Ice Age, specifically about the 



cause of the big glaciations which, 
as we now know, once buried 
large portions of North America 
and most of northern Europe under thousands of feet of glacier 
ice. 

There is hardly another prob



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



97 



lem in the realm of Natural History about which so many people 
have written so much with so 
little success as that of the causes 
of the Ice Age. Nor is there another problem for which so many 
"explanations" have been advanced. Some of them now make 
us shake our heads in wonderment. 

In order to understand the 
story of these hypotheses, we have 
to remember that the first traces 
of the Ice Age were found in 
Europe. 

For centuries, people could not 
help noticing that almost everywhere in northern Europe — north 
of the Alps and east of the Rhine 
— the flat sandy plain was strewn 
with boulders, small, middlesved and large. Except for a few 
more or less local legends which 
accorded full credit to the devil 
or some demons, the boulders 
went unexplained until the Englishman Charles Lyell, the father 
of modern geology, advanced an 
ingenious explanation. This plain, 
he stated, had once been flooded 
by a shallow sea and the boulders had drifted southward from 
the North, carried in icebergs 
which gradually melted. 

A number of geologists seem to 
have felt uneasily that this explanation did not cover all the 
observed facts. In Switzerland, 
for example, the glaciers had obviously been much larger at some 



time in the past. And there were 
other indications which pointed 
to ice rather than water. But 
Lyell's shallow sea was the "easy 
way out" and the idea lingered 
on until the head of the Swedish 
Geological Society, Otto Martin 
Torell, finally disproved it in 
1875. 

Meanwhile, those who thought 
of ice rather than water tried to 
explain the ice. In fact, the term 
Ice Age had already been coined, 
interestingly enough in a poem, 
which, however, was written by a 
professional geologist, Schimper 
by name. At first things seemed 
simple enough — maybe the land 
connection between North and 
South America had been broken 
at the time when Europe had its 
large glaciers. With the isthmus 
of Panama open, the Gulf Stream 
would flow into the Pacific, hence 
Europe would freeze. The simple 
thought was ruined by reports 
from North America, saying in so 
many words that there was evidence for a North American 
glaciation, too. 

TT looked as if the Earth as a 
■* whole had been cooler periodically and the logical consequence was a whole batch of 
theories with an astronomical 
basis. Obviously, if the whole 
planet had been subjected to a 
calamity, the cause had to be 
somewhere in space. 



98 




 



For a while, the reasoning of 
Dr. Eugene Dubois, the Dutch 
physician who had entered the 
Colonial Service in order to go to 
the- East Indies, where he intended to discover the ancestor of 
Man (actually finding Pithecanthropus erectus), held full sway. 

His reasoning was that all our 
energy comes from the Sun. The 
Sun is a star like other stars. 
Any look at the sky shows us that 
there are blue stars, presumably 
the hottest; yellow stars, like our 
own; and red stars. And any picture of our sun shows that it is 
beginning to age. There are the 
sun spots, harbingers of the red 
phase. At present they are relatively small in numbers, but as 
the Sun continues to age, they 
will increase in number. Presumably, they had been more numerous in the past, and that was the 
time of the Ice Age. 

As most recent research has 
shown, he continued, the Ice Age 
had been a succession of four or 
maybe five glacier advances, 
separated by interglacial periods. 
For reasons still to be found, the 
Sun had gained strength again. 
But since we are obviously in just 
another interglacial period, the 
Sun will darken again and the ice 
will come back. 

It was all very impressive and 
had a somber moral at the end. It 
was not Dr. Dubois' fault that 
stellar astronomy was in its in


fancy and that nobody knew anything about atomic energy, for his 
book appeared in 1893. Now we 
know that the hot blue stars are" 
not the youngest, but relatively 
old stars, and that the red stars, 
at least the Red Giants, haven't 
started contracting yet. And while 
we don't know the cause of the 
sun spots, we are absolutely certain that they are not a sign of 
old age. 

What really discredited Dubois' 
theory, even before atomic energy was discovered, was the geological discovery that the so-called Ice Age had not been the first 
glaciation. There had been another one during the Permian 
period, followed by some 250 million years of the Triassic, Jurassic, 
Cretaceous and Tertiary periods, 
all of them warm enough to grow 
corals in the North Sea and 
palm trees in Labrador. And 
much further back, at the time 
when life had not even yet climbed out of the seas, there had been 
another glaciation. If the Sun had 
been "red" enough during the 
Permian period to permit a glaciation and had then "recovered" 
for a very long time, there was 
evidently something wrong with 
the whole concept. 

NOT that some people did not 
try to save this concept by 
means of another erroneous astronomical theory which was 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



99 



around at the time. The belief of 
at least some astronomers was 
that space was not completely 
empty. Modern astronomers say 
the same thing, but they have 
something different in mind. The 
idea then was that there was 
enough resistance in space to slow 
down the planets. At the same 
time it was also believed that the 
Sun renewed its energy by slowly 
contracting, aided by a constant 
bombardment of meteorites. 

Taking both these ideas together, with a view of explaining 
the glaciations of the pre -Cambrian and the Permian periods as 
well as the recent one, the following picture was formed: 

The Sun derived its energy 
from both contraction and meteoric ^bombardment. But that 
was not quite enough to balance 
the budget. Losing more energy 
than was received, the Sun slowly 
turned reddish and then red. On 
Earth, and presumably on the 
other planets, too, there was an 
Ice Age as a result. But just at 
that time, the innermost planet of 
all had contracted its orbit more 
and more because of the resistance of gases in space, and finally 
it grazed the solar surface. This, 
of course, was the end of that 
planet, but its comparatively 
large mass added so much energy 
to the Sun that it was restored to 
full yellow splendor. 

Thrice in the past, the theory 



said, the crash of the then inner^ 
most planet had saved the Sun 
and the other planets. Next time 
Mercury would be the planet 
coming unwillingly to the rescue. 
Then it would be Venus's turn, 
and after that Earth would fall 
into the Sun to end an Ice Age 
on Mars. 

It was all very dramatic. It was 
also highly incorrect. 

Now, of course, you cannot reason that the stove must be going 
out just because you feel less heat. 
It is also possible that you are 
farther away from the stove or 
else that there is a screen between 
you and the heater. In astronomical terms, bent upon explaining 
the Ice Age, the former theory 
meant that the orbit of the Earth 
might have changed. At present, 
the Earth's orbit is an almost 
perfect circle. What would happen if it were a more eccentric 
ellipse? According to Kepler's 
Second Law of Planetary Motion, the Earth, in a highly elliptical orbit, would move very fast 
when near the Sun and dawdle 
when far from the Sun. This 
would mean short, hot summers 
and long, cold winters. Hence a 
glaciatian, for the hot summer 
would be too short to completely 
melt the ice which had accumulated during the long winter. 

Just in case that any of this 
may remind some readers of Velikovsky, I want to make clear 



100 




 



that I am talking about ideas 
advanced prior to 1900. Evidently 
some of these old books provided him with "inspiration." 

So this meant that the Earth 
had traveled in an eccentric orbit 
at least three times, in between 
returning to the circular one it 
has now. What had caused these 
changes? Well, the authors hesitated at that point and started 
hedging with statements like having to accept facts even if we 
cannot explain them. Or saying 
that all the laws of Nature are not 
yet known. Or suggesting passing 
stars. 

THESE ideas, evolved mostly 
on the basis of a theory along 
these general lines first advanced 
by the Scotsman James Croll, received a severe setback for an 
entirely unexpected reason. A Dr. 
Schmick, by profession a high 
school teacher in Cologne, pointed 
out that a change in eccentricity 
of the orbit must necessarily influence the Earth's rotation — in 
other words, the length of the 
day. 

The thought was in itself correct. When Earth is running in a 
more elliptical orbit, the tides 
cause'd by the Sun should increase in intensity and slow the 
rotation down. What would happen then? Obviously there would 
be less centrifugal force along the 
equator, hence the waters would 



spread out more, in the direction 
of both poles. 

Sir Charles Lyell had, on occasion, remarked that equatorial 
land — as distinct from equatorial 
seas — should improve the climate 
of the Earth as a whole. Equatorial land would absorb more of 
the solar heat, while equatorial 
water would simply evaporate, be 
carried to the poles and cause 
more snow and ice there. In short, 
Lyell had said that an Ice Age 
was more likely when the equator 
was very wet. But a wet equator 
went with a near-circular orbit, 
which is what we have now. 

For quite some time, there was 
an extensive discussion about 
what a wet equator would do, 
the three main contributors to the 
fight being the American geologist Becker, the Norwegian botanist Axel Blytt, and the German 
professor Max Hildebrandt. In 
the course of the discussion, the 
original question about the eccentricity of the Earth's orbit was 
soon lost; it became primarily a 
question of whether a wet equator 
was enough cause in itself. 

Mostly because of the reasonably wet equator of our day and 
the non-Ice Age climate, it was 
decided that there had to be an 
additional cause. Becker thought 
that the inclination of the Earth's 
axis had to undergo changes ; 
Blytt and Hildebrandt were more 
interested in tall and large (and 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



101 



hypothetical) mountains. The 
high evaporation rate would do 
good only if in the high north and 
far south there were large mountain chains on which the moisture 
could condense and form glaciers. 

As can be seen, these ideas, although they started in the realm 
of astronomy, became more and 
more terrestrial as the debate 
went on. The shifts in the Earth's 
orbit quietly dropped out and 
were replaced by polar mountains or high plateaus. 

This was watched with some 
glee by a considerable group of 
geologists, both amateur and professional, who had never dabbled 
with the Cosmos, but had stayed 
on the ground with their theories. 

But the mail is heavy right now 
and I have to postpone examination oFthis second set of theories 
until next month, when the 
weather will be even more suitable for such discussion.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

(1) When mass is created from 
energy, how long would it take 
the gravity of that new mass to 
act upon objects some distance 
away? 

(2) What is it that makes 
homing pigeons home? 

Hartley M. Thompson 
545 W. \12th St. 
New York 22, N. Y. 



If anybody could really answer the Brat question and 
prove that his answer is correct, 
he should he awarded the Nobel 
Prize in Physics for several 
years running. The question 
should be stated, "What is the 
propagation velocity of gravity?" and the answer is that we 
don't even know yet whether 
gravity hag a propagation velocity. 

As regards homing pigeons, 
most ornithologists previously 
agreed that the birds orient 
themselves by eyesight. This answer was rendered plausible 
by the observation that the 
bird takes comparatively short 
flights at first, which arc gradually extended both in height 
and in distance. 

Some twenty years ago, however, reports came in which 
seemed to indicate that homing 
pigeons get confused about direction when near a large radio 
station. It was then concluded 
that the birds may have a "magnetic organ" and thai they 
orient themselves with reference to the Earth's magnetic 
field. If that were the case, a 
nearby radio station might well 
produce misleading signals in 
such an organ. But recently this 
has been" disproved by the simple expedient of attaching tiny 
magnets to the pigeon's wings. 
In spite of the magnets, the 



102 




 



birds homed without the least 
confusion. 

So eyesight seems to he the 
answer, after all. 

Do any of the asteroids have 
satellites? 

Jerome Pierce 
275 McMane Ave. 
Berkeley Heights, N. J. 
Of the dozen or so largest 
asteroids which are comparatively easy to observe, it KB 
definitely known that they do 
not have satellites. But it is 
quite possible that a number of 
the smalt asteroids which are 
below the limit of visibility of 
small and middle-sized telescopes revolve in pairs; i. e.. 
that two small asteroids of 
about equal size revolve around 
each other in their course 
around the Sun. No such case 
is actually on record, but it is 
a possibility. 

The continued reference to "no 
weight in space" baffles me. If 
your ship had attained a velocity 
away from the Earth faster than 
the Earth pulls you back, you 
can't have achieved weightlessness because the Earth still is 
pulling you back. 

Phil Davis 
1751 So. Victor 
Tu/sa, Oklahoma 
It is true that the Earth still 
is pulling you hack, but the 



state of weightlessness ( more 
properly called "zero-g condition* 1 ) is not due to being outside a gravitational field of 
measurable intensity. The zerog condition will result anywhere, even deep in a powerful 
gravitational field, provided the 
pull of gravity is not resisted. 
If you imagine a freely falling 
ship, you'll realize that the ship, 
the crew, and all the contents 
of the ship fall in the same direction with the same velocity. 
Hence a chair will not support 
a man, a floor will not support 
a chair, etc., etc., and everything will seem weightless. 

How will an atomic -powered 
airplane operate? 

J. 0. Curtis 
(no address given) 
Nothing has been said officially about atomic-powered airplanes except that one is being 
designed. It is virtually certain, 
however, that the principle will 
be the same that is utilized for 
the atomic propulsion of a submarine. That principle is that 
you run an atomic pile hot 
enough to boil a "working 
liquid"* which might be simply 
water, but could be something 
else, for example mercury. The 
vapor of the "working liquid" 
then drives 'a turbine, is condensed and then returned to 
the pile to he evaporated again. 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



103 



The turbine could drive a propeller directly, or else drive a 
generator which produces current that is fed into the drive 
motors, similar to the^Dieselelectric drive of modern locomotives. 

In short, we deal here with 
a kind of steam turbine, with 
an atomic pile replacing the old 
firebox. Quite apparently, the 
atomic-powered airplane will 
have to be large and, for this 
reason, is likely to he a flying 
boat. This conclusion is reinforced by the fact that the airplane manufacturing firm in 
charge of the design work i§ 
known for this type of aircraft. 

Why don't they use cartridges 
in big naval guns? It seems so 
cumiJfersome to load powder bags 
by hand. 

James Brook 

11 Cranberry St. 

Brooklyn 2, N. Y. 

If a big gun fires at a target 
four miles away, it obviously 
needs less powder than for firing at a target twenty miles 
away. Loading bags; is a method 
of adjusting the powder charge. 

It is not the cost of the gunpowder which is under consideration, but the life of the gun. 
If cartridges were used, they 
would he charged for maximum 
range and therefore exert maximum strain on the gun barrel 



with every round, causing maximum wear. For hand weapons 
this is unimportant, but largecaliber guns are much less expendable. 

A great many science fiction 
stories have spaceships going to 
other planets accelerating all the 
way. Since there is nothing in 
space to hinder a ship, couldn't 
it stop accelerating after escape 
velocity has been reached? 

Peter Salus 
1967 Andrews Ave. 
The Bronx 53, N. Y. 
The answer is yes, of course. 
The reason for the continuous 
acceleration used by many 
writers is that they want to reduce the duration of the trip 
as much as possible. The more 
than 200 days required for a 
trip to Mars or Venus, if the 
motors are cut as soon as escape 
velocity has been reached, are 
usually a dead interlude in the 
story. With continuous acceleration of 1 g, the trip would be 
cut to about two weeks. Fictional characters don't grow old 
in transit that way — but they 
would if they had to pay the 
fuel bill. 

On a certain planet, the people 
have a saying: "If a not the humidity, it's the heat." Can you 
describe this planet and its people?

Edward Wellen 
167 Centre Avenue 
New Rochelle, N. Y. 
This question came in in 
August when I was on vacation 
and was, therefore, unable to 
look up the galactic coordinates. 
It is obvious, however, that the 
inhabitants must be reptilian in 
nature, since reptiles have no 
sweat glands and therefore suffer heat strokes easily. On the 
other hand, no reptile ever felt 
an aversion to mud, so presumably humidity won't bother 
them. Although Dr. E. E. Smith 
did not record such a saying, it 
might be Velantia you have in 
mind. As regards transliteration 
■of the original sounds, please

That's his specialty. 

How far from the Earth is the 
point where both the Earth and 
the Moon exert the same gravitational pull on a rocket? 
M. M. Fried 
144-16 Jewel Avenue 
Kew Garden Hills, N. Y. 
That point is about 90 per 
cent of the way to the Moon. 
The average center-to-center 
distance of the Earth and the 
Moon is 239,000 miles, so the 
"neutral point" would be, in 
round figures, 25,000 miles 
from the center of the Moon. 
Since the distance Earth-Moon 
is not always precisely the same, 



the distance of the "point" 
shifts a little, too. 

Wouldn't it be possible to 
measure the diameter of Pluto by 
occultation of a star? 

John Westfall 
507 Kenmore Ave. 
Oakland 10, Calif. 
Of course, that would be 
possible, but there are certain 
difficulties. Pluto is so far away 
from the Earth that it is what 
astronomers call a '■'■difficult object." It does not show "a disk 
except in the largest instruments. For the same reason, it 
is less likely to cover (or "occult") a star than the large 
planets like Jupiter and Saturn 
or our own moon, which is not 
large, but near. The likelihood 
of a star occultation by Pluto 
has in all probability been 
checked and if there is one, 
astronomers will surely allot 
time on a big instrument for 
this purpose.

Leech 



Illustrated by CONNELL 



By PHILLIPS BARBEE 

A visitor should be fed, but 
this one could eat you out of 
house and home . . . literally! 

THE leech was waiting for countless centuries in the void 

food. For millenia it had between the stars. It was unaware 

been drifting across the when it finally reached a sun. 

vast emptiness of space. Without Life-giving radiation flared 

consciousness, it had spent the around the hard, dry spore.

Gravitation tugged at it 

A planet claimed it, with other 

stellar debris, and the leech fell, 

still dead -seeming within its 

tough spore case. 

One speck of dust among many, 

the winds blew it around the 

Earth, played with it, and let it 

fall. 

On the ground, it began to stir. 
Nourishment soaked in, permeating the spore case. It grew — and 
fed. 

FRANK CONNERS came up 
on the porch and coughed 
twice. "Say, pardon me, Professor," he said. 

The long, pale man didn't stir 
from the sagging couch. His hornrimmed glasses* were perched on 
his forehead, and he was snoring 
very gently. 

"I'm awful sorry to disturb 
you," Conners said, pushing back 
his battered felt hat. "I know it's 
your resttn' week and all, but 
there's something damned funny 
in the ditch." 

The pale man's left eyebrow 
twitched, but he showed no other 
sign of having heard. 

Frank Conners coughed again, 
holding his spade in one purpleveined hand. "Didja hear me, 
Professor?" 

"Of course I heard you," Micheals said in a muffled voice, his 
eyes still closed. "You found a 
pixie." 



"A what?" Conners asked, 

squinting at Micheals. 

"A little man in a green suit. 
Feed him milk, Conners." 

"No, sir. I think it's a rock." 

Micheals opened one eye and 
focused it in Conners' general direction. 

"I'm awfully sorry about it," 
Conners said. Professor Micheals' 
resting week was a ten-year-old 
custom, and his only eccentricity. 
All winter Micheals taught anthropology, worked on half a 
dozen committees, dabbled in 
physics and chemistry, and still 
found time to write a book a year. 
When summer came, he was 
tired. 

Arriving at his worked-out New 
York State farm, it was his invariable rule to do absolutely nothing for a week. He hired Frank 
Conners to cook for that week 
and generally make himself useful, while Professor Micheals 
slept. 

During the second week, Micheals would wander around, 
look at the trees and fish. By the 
third week he would be getting a 
tan, reading, repairing the sheds 
and climbing mountains. At the 
end of four weeks, he could hardly wait to get back to the city. 

But the resting week was sacred. 

"I really wouldn't bother you 
for anything small," Conners said 
apologetically. "But that damned

rock melted two inches off my 
spade." 

Micheals opened both eyes and 
sat up. Conners held out the 
spade. The rounded end was 
sheared cleanly off. Micheals 
swung himself off the couch and 
slipped his feet into battered moccasins. 

"Let's see this wonder," he said. 

THE object was lying in the 
ditch at the end of the front 
lawn, three feet from the main 
road. It was round, about the size 
of a truck tire, and solid throughout. It was about an inch thick, 
as far as he could tell, grayish 
black and intricately veined. 

"Oon't touch it," Conners 
warned. 

"I'm not going to. Let me have 
your spade." Micheals took the 
spade and prodded the object experimentally. It was completely 
unyielding. He held the spade to 
the surface for a moment, then 
withdrew it. Another inch was 
gone. 

Micheals frowned, and pushed 
his glasses tighter against his 
nose. He held the spade against 
the rock with one hand, the other 
held close to the surface. More of 
the spade disappeared. 

"Doe.sn't seem to be generating 
heat," he said to Conners. "Did 



you notice any the first time?" 
Conners shook his head. 
Micheals picked up a clod of 
dirt and tossed it on the object. 
The dirt dissolved quickly, leaving no trace on the gray-black 
surface. A large stone followed 
the dirt, and disappeared in the 
same way. 

"Isn't that just about the 
damnedest thing you ever saw, 
Professor?" Conners asked. 

"Yes," Micheals agreed, standing up again. "It just about is." 

He hefted the spade and 
brought it down smartly on the 
object. When it hit, he almost 
dropped the spade. He had been 
gripping the handle rigidly, 
braced for a recoil. But the spade 
struck that unyielding surface 
and stayed. There was no perceptible give, but absolutely no recoil. 

"Whatcha think it is?" Conners 
asked. 

"It's no stone," Micheals said. 
He stepped back. "A leech drinks 
blood. This thing seems to be 
drinking dirt. And spades." He 
struck it a few more times, experimentally. The two men looked at each other. On the road, 
half a dozen Army trucks rolled 
past. 

"I'm going to phone the college 
and ask a physics man about it," 




 



Micheals said. "Or a biologist. 
I'd like to get rid of that -thing 
before it spoils my lawn." 

They walked back to the house. 

EVERYTHING fed the leech. 
The wind added its modicum 
of kinetic energy, ruffling across 
the gray-black surface. Rain fell, 
and the force of each individual 
drop added to its store. The water 
was sucked in by the all-absorbing surface. 

The sunlight above it was absorbed, and converted into mass 
for its body. Beneath it, the soil 
was consumed, dirt, stones and 
branches broken down by the 
leech's complex cells and changed 
into energy. Energy was converted back into mass, and the leech 
grew. 

Slowly, the first flickers of consciousness began to return. Its 
first realization was of the impossible smallness of its body. 

It grew. 

When Micheals looked the next 
day, the leech was eight feet 
across, sticking out into the road 
and up the side of the lawn. The 
following day it was almost eighteen feet in diameter, shaped to fit 
the contour of the ditch, and covering most of the road. That day 
the sheriff drove up in his model 
A, followed by half the town. 

"Is that your leech thing, Professor Micheals?" Sheriff Flynn 
asked. 



"That's it," Micheals said. He 
had spent the past days looking 
unsuccessfully for an acid that 
would dissolve the leech. 

"We gotta get it out of the 
road," Flynn said, walking truculently up to the leech. "Something like this, you can't let it 
block the road, Professor. The 
Army's gotta use this road." 

"I'm terribly sorry," Micheals 
said with a straight face. "Go 
right ahead, Sheriff. But be careful. It's hot." The leech wasn't 
hot, but it seemed the simplest 
explanation under the circumstances. 

Micheals watched with interest 
as the sheriff tried to shove a 
crowbar under it. He smiled to 
himself when it was removed with 
half a foot of its length gone. 

The sheriff wasn't so easily discouraged. He had come prepared 
for a stubborn piece of rock. He 
went to the rumble seat of his car 
and took out a blowtorch and a 
sledgehammer, ignited the torch 
and focused it on one edge of the 
leech. 

After five minutes, there was 
no change. The gray didn't turn 
red or even seem to heat up. 
Sheriff Flynn continued to bake 
it for fifteen minutes, then called 
to one of the men. 

"Hit that spot with the sledge, 
Jerry." 

Jerry picked up the sledgehammer, motioned the sheriff 



THE- LEECH 



109 



back, and swung it over his head. 
He let out a howl as the hammer 
struck unyieldingly. There wasn't 
a fraction of recoil. 

In the distance they heard the 
roar of an Army convoy. 

"Now we'll get some action," 
Flynn said. 

T1*ICHEALS wasn't so sure. He 
walked around the periphery 
of the leech, asking himself what 
kind of substance would react 
that way. The answer was easy — 
no substance. No known substance. 

The driver in the lead jeep 
held up his hand, and the long 
convoy ground to a halt. A hard, 
efficient-looking officer stepped 
out of the jeep. From the star on 
either shoulder, Micheals knew 
he was a brigadier general. 

"You can't block this road," 
the general said. He was a tall, 
spare man in suntans, with a sunburned face and cold eyes. 
"Please clear that thing away." 

"We can't move it," Micheals 
said. He told the general what 
had happened in the past few 
days. 

"It must be moved," the general said. "This convoy must go 
through." He walked closer and 
looked at the leech. "You say it 
can't be jacked up by a crowbar? 
A torch won't burn it?" 

"That's right," Micheals said, 
smiling faintly. 



"Driver," the general said over 
his shoulder. "Ride over it." 

Micheals started to protest, but 
stopped himself. The military 
mind would have to find out in 
its own way. 

The driver put his jeep in gear 
and shot forward, jumping the 
leech's four-inch edge. The jeep 
got to the center of the leech and 
stopped. 

"I didn't tell you to stop!" the 
general bellowed. 

"I didn't, sir!" the driver protested. 

The jeep had been yanked to a 
stop and had stalled. The driver 
started it again, shifted to fourwheel drive, and tried to ram forward. The jeep was fixed immovably, as though set in concrete. 

"Pardon me," Micheals said, 
"If you look, you can see that the 
tires are melting down." 

The general stared, his hand 
creeping automatically toward 
his pistol belt. Then he shouted, 
"Jump, driver! Don't touch that 
gray stuff." 

White-faced, the driver climbed 
to the hood of his jeep, looked 
around him, and jumped clear. 

There was complete silence as 
everyone watched the jeep. First 
its tires melted down, and then 
the rims. The body, resting on the 
gray surface, melted, too. 

The aerial was the last to go. 

The general began to swear 
softly under his breath. He turned 



110 




 



to the driver. "Go back and have 
some men bring up hand grenades and dynamite." 

The driver ran back to the 
convoy. 

"I don't know what you've got 
here," the general said. "But it's 
not going to stop a U.S. Army 
convoy." 

Micheals wasn't so sure. 

THE leech was nearly awake 
now, and its body was calling 
for more and more food. It dissolved the soil under it at a furious rate, filling it in with its own 
body, flowing outward. 

A large object landed on it, and 
that became food also. Then suddenly — 

A burst of energy against its 
surface, and then another, and 
another. It consumed them gratefully, converting them into mass. 
Little metal pellets struck it, and 
their kinetic energy was absorbed, 
their mass converted. More explosions took place, helping to 
fill the starving cells. 

It began to sense things — controlled combustion around it, vibrations of wind, mass movements. 

There was another, greater explosion, a taste of real food ! 
Greedily it ate, growing faster. 
It waited anxiously for more explosions, while its cells screamed 
for food. 

But no more came. It contin


ued to feed on the soil and on the 
Sun's energy. Night came, noticeable for its lesser energy possibilities, and then more days and 
nights. Vibrating objects contin^ 
ued to move around it. 

It ate and grew and flowed. 

MICHAELS stood on a little 
hill, watching the dissolution of his house. The leech was 
several hundred yards across 
now, lapping at his front porch. 

Good-by, home, Micheals 
thought, remembering the ten 
summers he had spent there. 

The porch collapsed into the 
body of the leech. Bit by bit, the 
house crumpled. 

The leech looked like a field of 
lava now, a blasted spot on the 
green Earth. 

"Pardon me, sir," a soldier said, 
coming up behind him. "General 
O'Donnell would like to see you." 

"Right," Micheals said, and 
took his last look at the house. 

He followed the soldier through 
the barbed wire that had been 
set up in a half-mile circle around 
the leech. A company of soldiers 
was on guard around it, keeping 
back the reporters and the hundreds of curious people who had 
flocked to the scene. Micheals 
wondered why he was still allowed inside. Probably, he decided, because most of this was 
taking place on his land. 

The soldier brought him to a 



THE LEECH 



111 



tent. Micheals stooped and went 
in. General O'Donnell, still in 
suntans, was seated at a small 
desk. He motioned Micheals to a 
chair. 

' 1 1 ' ve been put in c h arge of 
getting rid of this leech," he said 
to Micheals. 

Micheals nodded, not commenting on the advisability of 
giving a soldier a scientist's job. 

"You're a professor, aren't 
you?" 

"Yes. Anthropology." 

"Good. Smoke?" The general 
lighted Micheals' cigarette. "I'd 
like you to stay around here in 
an advisory capacity. You were 
one of the first to see this leech. 
I'd appreciate your observations 
on — " he smiled — "the enemy." 

"I'4 be glad to," Micheals said. 
"However, I think this is more 
in the line of a physicist or a biochemist." 

"I don't want this place cluttered with scientists," General 
O'Donnell said, frowning at the 
tip of his cigarette. "Don't get me 
wrong. I have the greatest appreciation for science. I am, if I do 
say so, a scientific soldier. I'm 
always interested in the latest 
weapons. You can't fight any 
kind of a war any more without 
science." 

O'DONNELL'S sunburned face 
grew firm. "But I can't have 
a team of longhairs poking 



around this thing for the next 
month, holding me up. My job 
is to destroy it, by any means in 
my power, and at once. I am going to do jiust that." 

"I don't think you'll find it 
that easy," Micheals said. 

"That's what I want you for," 
O'Donnell said. "Tell me why 
and I'll figure out a way of doing 
it." 

"Well, as far as I can figure 
out, the leech is an organic massenergy converter, and a frighteningly efficient one. I would guess 
that it has a double cycle. First, 
it converts mass into energy, then 
back into mass for its body. Second, energy is converted directly 
into the body mass. How this 
takes place, I do not know. The 
leech is not protoplasmic. It may 
not even be cellular — " 

"So we need something big 
against it," O'Donnell interrupted. "Well, that's all right. I've 
got some big stuff here." 

"I don't think you understand 
me," Micheals said. "Perhaps I'm 
not phrasing this very well. The 
leech eats energy. It can consume the strength of any energy 
weapon you use against it." 

"What happens," O'Donnell 
asked, "if it keeps on eating?" 

"I have no idea what its 
growth-limits are," Micheals 
said. "Its growth may be limited 
only by its food source." 

"You mean it could continue 



112 




 



to grow probably forever?" 

"It could possibly grow as long 
as it had something to feed on." 

"This is really a challenge," 
O'Donnell said. "That leech can't 
be totally impervious to force." 

"It seems to be. I suggest you 
get some physicists in here. Some 
biologists also. Have them figure 
out a way of nullifying it." 

The general put out his cigarette. "Professor, I cannot wait 
while scientists wrangle. There is 
an axiom of mine which I am 
going to tell you." He paused impressively. "Nothing is impervious to force. Muster enough 
force and anything will give. 
Anything. 

"Professor," the general continued, in a friendlier tone, "you 
shouldn't sell short the science 
you represent. We have, massed 
under North Hill, the greatest accumulation of energy and radioactive weapons ever assembled in 
one spot. Do you think your leech 
can stand the full force of them?" 
, "I suppose it's possible to overload the thing," Micheals said 
doubtfully. He realized now why 
the general wanted him around. 
He supplied the trappings of science, without the authority to 
override O'Donnell. 

"Come with me," General 
O'Donnell said cheerfully, getting 
up and holding back a flap of the 
tent. "We're going to crack that 
leech in half." 



A FTER a long wait, rich food 
started to come again, piped 
into one side of it. First there was 
only a little, and then more and 
more. Radiations, vibrations, explosions, solids, liquids — an 
amazing variety of edibles. It accepted them all. But the food 
was coming too slowly for the 
starving cells, for new cells were 
constantly adding their demands 
to the rest. 

The ever-hungry body screamed for more food, faster! 

Now that it had reached a fairly efficient size, it was fully 
awake. It puzzled over the energy-impressions around it, locating the source of the new food 
massed in one spot. 

Effortlessly it pushed itself into 
the air, flew a little way and 
dropped on the food. Its superefficient cells eagerly gulped the 
rich radioactive substances. But 
it did not ignore the lesser potentials of metal and clumps of carbohydrates. 

I^HE damned fools," General 
O'Donnell said. "Why did 
they have to panic? You'd think 
they'd never been trained." He 
paced the ground outside his tent, 
now in a new location three miles 
back. 

The leech had grown to two 
miles in diameter. Three farming 
communities had been evacuated. 

Micheals, standing beside the 



THE LEECH 



113 



general, was still stupefied by the 
memory. The leech had accepted 
the massed power of the weapons 
for a while, and then its entire 
bulk had lifted in the air. The 
Sun had been blotted out as it 
flew leisurely over North Hill, 
and dropped. There should have 
been time for evacuation, but the 
frightened soldiers had been blind 
with fear. 

Sixty- seven men were lost in 
Operation Leech, and General 
O'Donnell asked permission to 
use atomic bombs. Washington 
sent a group of scientists to investigate the situation. 

"Haven't those experts decided 
yet?" O'Donnell asked, halting 
angrily in front of the tent. 
"They've been talking long 
eno»*gh." 

"It's a hard decision," Micheals said. Since he wasn't an 
official member of the investigating team, he had given his information and left. "The physicists 
consider it a biological matter, 
and the biologists seem to think 
the chemists should have the answer. No one's an expert on this, 
because it's never happened before. We just don't have the 
data." 

"It's a military problem," 
O'Donnell said harshly. "I'm not 
interested in what the thing is — 
I want to know what can destroy 
it. They'd better give me permis* 
sion to use the bomb." 



Micheals had made his own 
calculations on that. It was impossible to say for sure, but taking a flying guess at the leech's 
mass-energy absorption rate, figuring in its size"" and apparent 
capacity for growth, an atomic 
bomb might overload it — if used 
soon enough. 

He estimated three days as the 
limit of usefulness. The leech was 
growing at a geometric rate. It 
could cover the United States in 
a few months. 

"For a week I've been asking 
permission to use the bomb," 
O'Donnell grumbled. "And I'll 
get it, but not until after those 
jackasses end their damned talking." He stopped pacing and 
turned to Micheals. "I am going 
to destroy the leech. I am going 
to smash it, if that's the last thing 
I do. It's more than a matter of 
security now. It's personal pride." 

That attitude might make great 
generals, Micheals thought, but 
it wasn't the way to consider this 
problem. It was anthropomorphic 
of O'Donnell to see the leech as 
an enemy. Even the identification, 
"leech," was a humanizing factor. 
O'Donnell was dealing with it as 
he would any physical obstacle, 
as though the leech were the simple equivalent of a large army. 

But the leech was not human, 
not even of this planet, perhaps. 
It should be dealt with in its own 
terms. 



114 




 



"Here come the bright boys 
now,*' O'Donnell said. 

FROM a nearby tent a group of 
weary men emerged, led by 
AUenson, a government biologist. 

"Well," the general asked, 
"have you figured out what it is?" 

"Just a minute, I'll hack off a 
sample," Allenson said, glaring 
through red-rimmed eyes. 

"Have you figured out some 
scientific way of killing it?" 

"Oh, that wasn't too difficult," 
Moriarty, an atomic physicist, 
said wryly. "Wrap it in a perfect 
vacuum. That'll do the trick. Or 
blow it off the Earth with antigravity." 

"But failing that," Allenson 
said, "we suggest you use your 
atomic bombs, and use them 
fast." 

"Is that the opinion of your 
entire group?" O'Donnell asked, 
his eyes glittering. 

"Yes." 

The general hurried away. Micheals joined the scientists. 

"He should have called us in 
at the very first," Allenson complained. "There's no time to consider anything but force now." 

"Have you come to any conclusions about the nature of the 
leech?" Micheals asked. 

"Only general ones," Moriarty 
said, "and they're about the same 
as yours. The leech is probably 
extraterrestrial in origin. "It seems 



to have been in a spore-stage until it landed on Earth." He paused 
to light a pipe. "Incidentally, we 
should be damned glad it didn't 
drop in an ocean. We'd have had 
the Earth eaten out from under 
us before we knew what we were 
looking for." 

They walked in silence for a 
few minutes. 

"As you mentioned, it's a perfect converter — it can transform 
mass into energy, and any energy 
into mass." Moriarty grinned. 
"Naturally that's impossible and 
I have figures to prove it." 

"I'm going to get a drink," Allenson said. "Anyone coming?" 

"Best idea of the week," Micheals said. "I wonder how long 
it'll take O'Donnell to get permission to use the bomb." 

"If I know politics," Moriarty 
said, "too long." 

THE findings of the government 
scientists were checked by 
other government scientists. That 
took a few days. Then Washington wanted to know if there 
wasn't some alternative to exploding a.n atomic bomb in the 
middle of New York State. It 
took a little time to convince 
them of the necessity. After that, 
people had to be evacuated, which 
took more time. 

Then orders were made out, 
and five atomic bombs were 
checked out of a cache. A- patrol 



THE LEECH 



115 



rocket was assigned, given orders, 
and put under General O'Donnell's command. This took a day 
more. 

Finally, the stubby scout rocket 
was winging its way over New 
York. From the air, the grayishblack spot was easy to find. Like 
a festered wound, it stretched between Lake Placid and Elizabethtown, covering Keene and Keene 
Valley, and lapping at the edges 
of Jay. 

The first bomb was released. 

IT had been a long wait after 
the first rich food. The greater 
radiation of day was followed by 
the lesser energy of night many 
times, as the leech ate away the 
Earth beneath it, absorbed the 
air around it, and grew. Then one 
day — 

An amazing burst of energy! 

Everything was food for the 
leech, but there was always the 
possibility of choking. The energy poured over it, drenched it, 
battered it, and the leech grew 
frantically, trying to contain the 
titanic dose. Still small, it quickly 
reached its overload limit. The 
strained cells, filled to satiation, 
were given more and more food. 
The strangling body built new 
cells at lightning speed. And — 

It held. The energy was controlled, stimulating further 
growth. More cells took over the 
load, sucking in the food. 

116 1 



The next doses were wonderfully palatable, easily handled. 
The leech overflowed its bounds, 
growing, eating, and growing. 

That was a taste of real food! 
The leech was as near ecstasy as 
it had ever been. It waited hopefully for more, but no more came. 

It went back to feeding on the 
Earth. The energy, used to produce more cells, was soon dissipated. Soon it was hungry 
again. 

It would always be hungry. 

O'DONNELL retreated with 
his demoralized men. They 
camped ten miles from the leech's 
southern edge, in the evacuated 
town of Schroon Lake. The leech 
was over sixty miles in diameter 
now and still growing fast. It lay 
sprawled over the Adirondack 
Mountains, completely blanketing everything from Saranac 
Lake to Port Henry, with one 
edge of it over Westport, in Lake 
Champlain. 

Everyone within two hundred 
miles of the leech was evacuated. 

General O'Donnell was given 
permission to use hydrogen 
bombs, contingent on the approval of his scientists. 

"What have the bright boys 
decided?" O'Donnell wanted to 
know. 

He and Micheals were in the 
living room of an evacuated 
Schroon Lake house. O'Donnell 


 



had made it his new command 
post. 

"Why are they hedging?" 
O'Donnell demanded impatiently. 
"The leech has to be blown up 
quick. What are they fooling 
a Found for?" 

"They're afraid of a chain reaction," Micheals told him. "A 
concentration of hydrogen bombs 
might set one up in the Earth's 
crust or in the atmosphere. It 
might do any of half a dozen 
things." 

"Perhaps they'd like me to order a bayonet attack," O'Donnell 
said contemptuously. 

Micheals sighed and sat down 
in an armchair. He was convinced 
that the whole method was 
wrong. The government scientists 
were being rushed into a single 
line of inquiry. The pressure on 
them was so great that they didn't 
have a chance to consider any 
other approach but force — and 
the leech thrived on that. 

Micheals was certain that there 
were times when fighting fire with 
fire was not applicable. 

Fire. Loki, god of fire. And of 
trickery. No, there was no answer 
there. But Micheals' mind was in 
mythology now, retreating from 
the unbearable present. 

Allenson came in, followed by 
six other men. 

"Well," Allenson said, "there's 
a damned good chance of splitting the Earth wide open if you 



use the number of bombs our 
figures show you need." 

"You have to take chances in 
war," O'Donnell replied bluntly. 
"Shall I go ahead?" 

Micheals saw, suddenly, that 
O'Donnell didn't care if he did 
crack the Earth. The red-faced 
general only knew that he was 
going to set off the greatest explosion ever produced by the 
hand of Man. 

"Not so fast," Allenson said. 
"I'll let the others spea k for 
themselves." 

The general contained himself 
with difficulty. "Remember," he 
said, "according to your own figures, the leech is growing at the 
rate of twenty feet an hour." 

"And speeding up," Allenson 
added. "But this isn't a decision 
to be made in haste." 

Micheals found his mind wandering again, to the lightning 
bolts of Zeus. That was what 
they needed. Or the strength of 
Hercules. , 

Or— 

He sat up suddenly. "Gentlemen, I believe I can offer you a 
possible alternative, although it's 
a very dim one." 

They stared at him. 

"Have you ever heard of Antaeus?" he asked. 

HPHE more the leech ate, the 
faster it grew and the hungrier it became. Although its 



THE LEECH 



117 



birth was forgotten, it did remember a long way back. It had 
eaten a planet in that ancient 
past. Grown tremendous, ravenous, it had made the journey to 
a nearby star and eaten that, replenishing the cells converted 
into energy for the trip. But then 
there was no more food, and the 
next star was an enormous distance away. 

It set out on the journey, but 
long before it reached the food, 
its energy ran out. Mass, converted back to energy to make the 
trip, was used up. It shrank. 

Finally, all the energy was 
gone. It was a spore, drifting aimlessly, lifelessly, in space. 

That was the first time. Or was 
it? It thought it could remember 
back to a distant, misty time 
when the Universe was evenly 
covered with stars. It had eaten 
through them, cutting away 
whole sections, growing, swelling. 
And the stars had swung off in 
terror, forming galaxies and constellations. 

Or was that a dream? 
Methodically, it fed on the 
Earth, wondering where the rich 
food was. And then it was back 
again, but this time above the 
leech. 

It waited, but the tantalizing 
food remained out of reach. It 
was able to sense how rich and 
pure the food was. 

Why didn't it fall? 



For a long time the leech waited, but the food stayed out of 
reach. At last, it lifted and followed. 

The food retreated, up, up from 
the surface of the planet. The 
leech went after as quickly as its 
bulk would allow. 

The rich food fled out, into 
space, and the leech followed. 
Beyond, it could sense an even 
richer source. 

The hot, wonderful food of a 
sun! 

O'DONNELL served champagne for the scientists in the 
control room. Official dinners 
would follow, but this was the 
victory celebration. 

"A toast," the general said, 
standing. The men raised their 
glasses. The only man not drinking was a lieutenant, sitting in 
front of the control board that 
guided the drone spaceship. 

"To Micheals, for thinking of 
— what was it again, Micheals?" 

"Antaeus." Michaels had been 
drinking champagne steadily, but 
he didn't feel elated. Antaeus, 
born of Ge, the Earth, and Poseidon, the Sea. The invincible 
wrestler. Each time Hercules 
threw him to the ground, he arose 
refreshed. 

Until Hercules held him in the 
air. 

Moriarty was muttering to 
himself, figuring with slide rule, 



lis 




 



pencil and paper. Allenson was 
drinking, but he didn't look too 
happy about it. 

"Come on, you birds of evil 
omen," O'Donnell said, pouring 
more champagne. "Figure it out 
later. Right now, drink.*' He turned to the operator. "How's it going?" 

Micheals' analogy had been 
applied to a spaceship. The ship, 
operated by remote control, was 
filled with pure radioactives. It 
hovered over the leech until, rising to the bait, it had followed. 
Antaeus had left his mother, the 
Earth, and was losing his strength 
in the air. The operator was allowing the spaceship to run fast 
enough to keep out of the leech's 
grasp, but close enough to keep 
it coming. 

The spaceship and the leech 
were on a collision course with 
the Sun. 

"Fine, sir," the operator said. 
"It's inside the orbit of Mercury 

now." 

• "Men," the general said, "I 
swore to destroy that thing. This 
isn't exactly the way I wanted to 
do it. I figured on a more personal way. But the important 
thing is the destruction. You will 
all witness it. Destruction is at 
times a sacred mission. This is 
such a time. Men, I feel wonderful." 

"Turn the spaceship!" It was 
Moriarty who had spoken. His 



face was white. "Turn the damned thing!" 

He shoved his figures at them. 

They were easy to read. The 
growth -rate of the leech. The 
energy -consumption rate, estimated. Its speed in space, a 
constant. The energy it would 
receive from the Sun as it approached, an exponential curve. 
Its energy -absorption rate, figured in terms of growth, expressed as a hyped-up discontinuous 
progression. 

The result — 

"It'll consume the Sun," Moriarty said, very quietly. 

The control room turned into 
a bedlam. Six of them tried to 
explain it to O'Donnell at the 
same time. Then Moriarty tried, 
and finally Allenson. 

"Its rate of growth is so great 
and its speed so slow — and it will 
get so much energy — that the 
leech will be able to consume the 
Sun by the time it gets there. Or, 
at least, to live off it until it can 
consume it." 

O'Donnell didn't bother to understand. He turned to the operator. 

"Turn it," he said. 
They all hovered over the radar screen, waiting. 

THE food tumefi out of the 
leech's path and streaked 
away. Ahead was a tremendous 
source, but still a long way off. 



THE LEECH 



119 



The leech hesitated. 

Its cells, recklessly expending 
energy, shouted for a decision. 
The food slowed, tantalizingly 
near. 

The closer source or the 
greater? 

The leech's body wanted food 
now. 

It started after it, away from 
the Sun. 

The Sun would come next. 

"TJULL it out at right angles to 
■■• the plane of the Solar System/' Allenson said. 

The operator touched the controls. On the radar screen, they 
saw a blob pursuing a dot. It had 
turned. 

Relief washed over them. It 
had been close! 

"fti what portion of the sky 
would the leech be?" O'Donnell 
asked, his face expressionless. 

"Come outside; I believe I can 
show you," an astronomer said. 
They walked to the door. "Somewhere in that section," the astronomer said, pointing. 

"Fine. All right, Soldier," 
O'Donnell told the operator. 
"Carry out your orders." 

The scientists gasped in unison. The operator manipulated 
the controls and the blob began 
to overtake " the dot. Micheals 
started across the room. 

"Stop," the general said, and 
his strong, commanding voice 



stopped Micheals. "I know what 
I'm doing. I had that ship especially built." 

The blot overtook the dot on 
the radar screen. 

"I told you this was a personal 
matter," O'Donnell said. "I swore 
to destroy that leech. We can 
never have any security while it 
lives." He smiled. "Shall we look 
at the sky?" 

The general strolled to the 
door, followed by the scientists. 

"Push the button, Soldier I" 

The operator did. For a moment, nothing happened. Then 
the sky lit up! 

A bright star hung in space. 
Its brilliance filled the night, 
grew, and started to fade. 

"What did you do?" Micheals 
gasped. 

"That rocket was built around 
a hydrogen bomb," O'Donnell 
said, his strong face triumphant. 
"I set it off at the contact moment." He called to the operator 
again. "Is there anything showing on the radar?" 

"Not a speck, sir." 

"Men," the general said, "I 
have met the enemy and he is 
mine. Let's have some more 
champagne." 

But Micheals found that he 
was suddenly ill. 

TT had been shrinking from the 
expenditure of energy, when 
the great explosion came. No

thought of containing it. The 
leech's cells held for the barest 
fraction of a second, and then 
spontaneously overloaded. 

The leech was smashed, broken 
up, destroyed. It was split into a 
thousand particles, and the particles were split a million times 
more. 

The particles were thrown out 
on the wave front of the explosion, and they split further, spontaneously
Into spores. 

The spores closed into dry, 
hard, seemingly lifeless specks of 
dust, billions of them, scattered, 
drifting. Unconscious, they floated in the emptiness of space. 

Billions of them, waiting to be 
fed.

Now here's a problem— how to tell 
you about the second installment of 
RING AROUND THE SUN without

Intelligence officers who cannot lie

THE HEADS OF CERBERUS 
by Francis Stevens. Polaris Press, 
Reading, Pa., 1952. 190 pages, 
$3.00 

AGAIN, as was the case last 
month, our best book is a 
"classic." This handsomely printed limited edition, first in what 
is to be known as the Polaris 
Fantasy Library, and available 
from the publisher only and not 
through bookstores, presents perhaps the first science fantasy to 
use the alternate time- track, or 
parallel worlds, idea. It was first 
published in 1919 in an early 
Street & Smith pulp. 

Even more interesting is the 



fact that "Francis Stevens" was 
actually a woman writer by the 
name of Gertrude Bennett who 
was born in 1884 and who literally disappeared in 1939. She took 
up writing to support herself and 
her infant daughter after her husband had been drowned in a 
tropical storm. 

Despite its age and its amateur 
origins, The Heads of Cerberus 
is still readable and remarkably 
pointed. The book one can most 
closely compare it to is Fredric 
Brown's What Mad Universe. It 
tells of an alternate- world Philadelphia, reached by a handful of 
this-world people through some 
semi -black -magic nonsense that is 



124 




 



no more unscientific than a time 
machine. 

This Philadelphia is one in 
which the political corrupters of 
the 1900s have become ruthless 
autocrats, ruling through phony 
"civic service" competitions which 
result in a cynically brutal enslavement of the people. The 
name of William Penn has become, under the organizational 
label of "Penn Service," the very 
fountainhead of cruel, dictatorial, 
viciously depraved government. 

Despite a good deal of pseudomystical mumbo-jumbo, this is 
definitely a classic worth preserving — and, unlike many classics, 
also fun to read. 

THE CREATION OF THE 
UNIVERSE by George Gamow. 
Viking Press, New York, 1952. 
160 pages, 11 plates and 40 diagrams, $3.75 

IN this book Professor Gamow 
has brought together many of 
the current theories on the origins 
of the universe, our galaxy, and 
our sun and planets. He has 
woven from them a fascinating 
picture of one of the several possible ways whereby primordial 
matter -energy could have been 
transformed into the visible and 
invisible universe as we know 
and deduce it. It is science fiction of the highest order : science 
fiction based on sound science, on 



logical deductions from scientific 
facts, and on some almost poetic 
extra -scientific — nor non-scientific — assumptions. 

Essentially Professor Gamow 
is a relativist. He believes, also, 
in a cosmic beginning as opposed 
to the steady-state universe that 
Fred Hoyle and others suggest. 
To Gamow, the expanding universe is a logical deduction from 
available evidence. Most of the 
way through the book, one fears 
that the author has pulled the 
Lucretian boner: "From unity to 
infinity but in the very last 
section he postulates "the cornucopia open at both ends," and is 
saved from the great philosophical blunder. 

Many people today are looking 
for certitudes that science cannot 
offer; Gamow makes no compromises for these folk. His is a 
strictly material universe, and — 
despite many unprovable assumptions — a universe that is 
basically understandable. It has 
very little room for the mystic or 
the spiritual. 

However, the author does accept certain theories, such as the 
idea that the Moon was torn out 
of the Pacific basin after the 
actual formation of the Earth, 
that are far from accepted even 
by the more liberal cosmogonists. 

In other words, this volume is 
not the Compleat Answer. But 
within its limitations, it is a lucid,

lively and literate popularization 
of an ever-exciting subject — 
Where We Came from and Are 
Going. 

EIDOLON by J. David Stern. 
Julian Messner, Inc., New York, 
1952. 246 pages, $3.00 

THE HAPLOIDS by Jerry Sohl. 
Rinehart <& Co., New York, 1952. 
248 pages, $2.50 

WE are confronted with two 
widely differing novels 
which have one curious new scientific gimmick in common. The 
gimmick is parthenogenesis, or 
the creation by women alone of 
haploid, or half-chromosomed, 
people without the aid of males. 
Perhaps the idea itself, though 
scientifically sound as regards 
certain one-celled creatures, is 
poor when it comes to humans; 
in any event, it has produced two 
poor books. 

Of the two, I prefer Sohl's, for 
it is at least unpretentious. It 
tells of a tribe of horrid haploid 
females who set out to eliminate 
men by means of a ray that attacks the Y chromosomes found 
only in the male sex and bumps 
off their owners. 

There's the usual mad scientist 
(female, for a change), the cutfrom -cardboard heroine who has 
been fooled into thinking that 
she's haploid whereas (of course) 



she really has all her genetic 
marbles and can reproduce her 
kind, and the reporter -hero, Model 124C414- from the stock catalog. The book may amuse you 
for an hour or so. It did me, and 
maybe that's enough. 

Eidolon, on the other hand, 
by the ex-publisher of the New 
York Post and the Philadelphia 
Record, is anything but entertaining. The story of a lone haploid superman, it is one of the 
most interminable bores I have 
ever tried to burrow through. 

One-twentieth "science" "fiction," and nineteen -twentieths 
verbose promotion of its author's 
sick conglomeration of ideas for 
saving the World,, defeating Communism, bringing science and religion together, and elevating the 
masses, the book ends up by infuriating the reader so thoroughly that he completely loses the 
values of its "elevating ideas" in 
the wallow of its forever unwinding declamations. 

The "science spiked by suspense" referred to on the jacket 
is — believe it or not — a solemnfaced replica of the original 
Virgin Birth! The hero's mother, 
in a sublime effort to reconcile 
the facts of science and the mysteries of religion, retires to an 
attic for two weeks of contemplation and comes down pregnant. 
Sho nuff, it's our haploid hero, 
and this proves to everyone's sat


126 




 



isfaction the mastery of Mind 
over Matter and the invincible 
superiority of superstition over 
science. 

The book is absolutely sincere. 
Somehow that makes it all the 
worse. 

Don't fail to miss it. 

SHIP OF DESTINY by Henry 
J. Slater. Thomas Y. Crowell Co., 
New York, 1951. 187 pages, $2.75 

rriHIS novel is a pretty fair ex■■- ample of the current output of 
non- professional British science 
fiction, of which there is a surprising lot. 

It has a reasonably real group 
of characters — engaged in total 
implausible actions in a setting 
that has practically no science 
fiction validity. 

It is not badly written, but is 
nevertheless almost endlessly repetitive. 

It has some imagination, yet 
deals inadequately with a very 
ancient theme much better handled by such earlier Britons as 
Wright and Shiel — the catastrophic subsidence of all the 
Earth's land masses and the sur


vival of a small group of people, 
mainly British, to "carry on" on 
the newly risen continents. 

Shades of Deluge and The 
Purple Cloud? Very much so. 

The action takes place on a 
luxury liner, one of two vessels 
that, as far as can be ascertained, 
are the only objects other than 
water that remained on the surface of the Earth after the Cataclysm. 

What drama there is (which is 
slight indeed) is whipped up over 
the attempts at adjustment and 
reorganization of the people remaining. The reorganization is 
handled in a typically Britishship's - officers' fashion — "the 
manly thing," "do what's decent," 
"sisters under the skin," and so 
on. 

A second ship is dragged in for 
suspense, but succeeds in adding 
only a pretty fair description of 
a sinking. 

There is no science in the book, 
and precious little acceptable fiction. 

A pretty bad month. 
Thank heaven for Stevens and 
Gamow!

If easy payment plans were 

to be really efficient, patrons' 

lifetimes had to be extended! 

By ROBERT SHECKLEY 



CARRIN decided that he 
could trace his present 
mood to Miller's suicide 
last week. But the knowledge 
didn't help him get rid of the 
vague, formless fear in the back 
of his mind. It was foolish. Miller's suicide didn't concern him. 

But why had that fat, jovial 
man killed himself? Miller had 



had everything to live for — wife, 
kids, good job, and all the marvelous luxuries of the age. Why 
had he done it? 

"Good morning, dear," Carrin's wife said as he sat down at 
the breakfast table. 

"Morning, honey. Morning, 
Billy." 

His son grunted something. 



Illustrated by EMSH 




 



You just couldn't tell about 
people, Carrin decided, and dialed his breakfast. The meal was 
gracefully prepared and served 
by the new Avignon Electric Auto-cook. 

His mood persisted, annoyingly 
enough since Carrin wanted to 
be in top form this morning. It 
was his day off , and the Avignon 
Electric finance man was coming. 
This was an important day. 

He walked to the door with his 
son. 

"Have a good day, Billy." 

His son nodded, shifted his 
books and started to school without answering. Carrin wondered 
if something was bothering him, 
too. He hoped not. One worrier 
in the family was plenty. 

"See you later, honey." He 
kissed his wife as she left to go 
shopping. 

At any rate, he thought, watching her go down the walk, at 
least she's happy. He wondered 
how much she'd spend at the 
A. E. store. 

Checking his watch, he found 
that he had half an hour before 
the A. E. finance man was due. 
The best way to get rid of a bad 
mood was to drown it, he told 
himself, and headed for the 
shower. 

THE shower room was a glittering plastic wonder, and the 
sheer luxury of it eased Carrin's 



mind. He threw his clothes into 
the A. E. automatic Kleen-presser, and adjusted the shower spray 
to a notch above "brisk." The 
five- degrees-above-skin-temperature water beat against his thin 
white body. Delightful! And then 
a relaxing rub-dry in the A. E. 
Auto -towel. 

Wonderful, he thought, as the 
towel stretched and kneaded his 
stringy muscles. And it should be 
wonderful, he reminded himself. 
The A. E. Auto-towel with shaving attachments had cost three 
hundred and thirteen dollars, plus 
tax. 

But worth every penny of it, 
he decided, as the A. E. shaver 
came out of a corner and whisked 
off his rudimentary stubble. 
After all, what good was life if 
you couldn't enjoy the luxuries? 

His skin tingled when he 
switched off the Auto-towel. He 
should have been feeling wonderful, but he wasn't. Miller's suicide kept nagging at his mind, 
destroying the peace of his day 
off. 

Was there anything else bothering him? Certainly there was 
nothing wrong with the house. 
His papers were in order for the 
finance man. 

"Have I forgotten something?" 
he asked out loud. 

"The Avignon Electric finance 
man will be here in fifteen minutes," his A. E. bathrpom Wall

reminder whispered. 

"I know that. Is there anything 
else?" 

The Wall -reminder reeled off 
its memorized data - — a vast 
amount of minutiae about watering the lawn, having the Jet-lash 
checked, buying lamb chops for 
Monday, and the like. Things he 
still hadn't found time for. 

"All right, that's enough." He 
allowed the A. E. Auto-dresser to 
dress him, skillfully draping a 
new selection of fabrics over his 
bony frame. A whiff of fashionable masculine perfume finished 
him and he went into the living 
room, threading his way between 
the appliances that lined the 
walls. 

A quick inspection of the dials 
on*the wall assured him that the 
house was in order. The breakfast dishes had been sanitized and 
stacked, the house had been 
cleaned, dusted, polished, his 
wife's garments had been hung 
up, his son's model rocket ships 
had been put back in the closet. 

Stop worrying, you hypochondriac, he told himself angrily. 

The door announced, "Mr. 
Pathis from Avignon Finance is 
here." 

Carrin started to tell the door 
to open, when he noticed the Automatic Bartender. 

Good God, why hadn't he 
thought of it! 

The Automatic Bartender was 



manufactured by Castile Motors. 
He had bought it in a weak moment. A. E. wouldn't think very 
highly of that, since they sold 
their own brand. 

HE wheeled the bartender into 
the kitchen, and told the 
door to open. 

"A very good day to you, sir," 
Mr. Pathis said. 

Pathis was a tall, imposing 
man, dressed in a conservative 
tweed drape. His eyes had the 
crinkled corners of a man who 
laughs frequently. He beamed 
broadly and shook Carrin's hand, 
looking around the crowded living room. 

"A beautiful place you have 
here, sir. Beautiful! As a matter 
of fact, I don't think I'll be overstepping the company's code to 
inform you that yours is the 
nicest interior in this section." 

Carrin felt a sudden glow of 
pride at that, thinking of the 
rows of identical houses, on this 
block and the next, and the one 
after that. 

"Now, then, is everything functioning properly?" Mr. Pathis 
asked, setting his briefcase on a 
chair. "Everything in order?" 

"Oh, yes," Carrin said enthusiastically. "Avignon Electric never 
goes out of whack." 

"The phone all right? Changes 
records for the full seventeen 
hours?" 



130 




 



"It certainly does," Carrin 
said. He hadn't had a chance to 
try out the phone, but it was a 
beautiful piece of furniture. 

"The Soli do-projector all right? 
Enjoying the programs?" 

"Absolutely perfect reception." 
He had watched a program just 
last month, and it had been start lingly lifelike. 

"How about the kitchen? Auto-cook in order? Recipe-master 
still knocking 'em out?" 

"Marvelous stuff. Simply marvelous." , 

Mr. Pathis went on to inquire 
about his refrigerator, his vacuum cleaner, his car, his 
helicopter, his subterranean swimming pool, and the hundreds of 
other items Carrin had bought 
from Avignon Electric. 

"Everything is swell," Carrin 
said, a trifle untruthfully since 
he hadn't unpacked every item 
yet. "Just wonderful." 

"I'm so glad," Mr. Pathis said, 
leaning back with a sigh of relief. 
"You have no idea how hard we 
try to satisfy our customers. If 
a product isn't right, back it 
comes, no questions asked. We 
believe in pleasing our customers." 

"I certainly appreciate it, Mr. 
Pathis." 

CARRIN hoped the A. E. man 
wouldn't ask to see the kitchen. He visualized the Castile 



Motors Bartender in there, like 
a porcupine in a dog show. 

"I'm proud to say that most of 
the people in this neighborhood 
buy from us," Mr. Pathis was 
saying. "We're a solid firm." 

"Was Mr. Miller a customer of 
yours?" Carrin asked. 

"That fellow who killed himself?" Pathis frowned briefly. 
"He was, as a matter of fact. 
That amazed me, sir, absolutely 
amazed me. Why, just last month 
the fellow bought a brand-new 
Jet-lash from me, capable of doing three hundred and fifty miles 
an hour on a straightaway. He 
was as happy as a kid over it, 
and then to go and do a thing 
like that! Of course, the Jet-lash 
brought up his debt a little." 

"Of course." 

"But what did that matter? 
He had every luxury in the world. 
And then he went and hung himself." 

"Hung himself?" 

"Yes," Pathis said, the frown 
coming back. "Every modern 
convenience in his house, and he 
hung himself with a piece of rope. 
Probably unbalanced for a long 
time." 

The frown slid off his face, and 
the customary smile replaced it. 
"But enough of that! Let's talk 
about you." 

The smile widened as Pathis 
opened his briefcase. "Now, then, 
your account. You owe us two

hundred and three thousand dollars and twenty-nine cents, Mr. 
Carrin, as of your last purchase. 
Right?" 

"Right," Carrin said, remembering the amount from his own 
papers. "Here's my installment." 

He handed Pathis an envelope, 
which the man checked and put 
in his pocket. 

"Fine. Now you know, Mr. 
Carrin, that you won't live long 
enough to pay us the full two 
hundred thousand, don't you?" 

"No, I don't suppose I will," 
Carrin said soberly. 

He was only thirty-nine, with 
a full hundred years of life before him, thanks to the marvels 
of medical science. But at a salary of three thousand a year, he 
still couldn't pay it all off and 
have enough to support a family 
on at the same time. 

*'Of course, we would not want 
to deprive you of necessities, 
which in any case is fully protected by the laws we helped 
formulate and pass. To say nothing of the terrific items that are 
coming out next year. Things 
you wouldn't want to miss, sir!" 

Mr. Carrin nodded. Certainly 
he wanted new items. 

"Well, suppose we make the 
customary arrangement. If you 
will just sign over your son's 
earnings for the first thirty years 
of his adult life, we can easily 
arrange credit for you." 



MR. Pathis whipped the papers 
out of his briefcase and 
spread them in front -of Carrin. 
"If you'll just sign here, sir." 
"Well," Carrin said, "I'm not 
sure. I'd like to give the boy a 
start in life, not saddle him 
with — " 

"But my dear sir," Pathis interposed, "this is for your son as 
well. He lives here, doesn't he? 
He has a right to enjoy the luxuries, the marvels of science." 

"Sure," Carrin said. "Only — " 

"Why, sir, today the average 
man is living like a king. A 
hundred years ago the richest 
man in the world couldn't buy 
what any ordinary citizen possesses at present. You mustn't 
look upon it as a debt. It's an 
investment." 

"That's true," Carrin said dubiously. 

He thought about his son and 
his rocket ship models, his star 
charts, his maps. Would it be 
right? he asked himself. 

"What's wrong?" Pathis asked 
cheerfully. 

"Well, I was just wondering," 
Carrin said. "Signing over my 
son's earnings — you don't think 
I'm getting in a little too deep, 
do you?" 

"Too deep? My dear sir!" 
Pathis exploded into laughter. 
"Do you know Mellon down the 
block? Well, don't say I said it, 
but he's already mortgaged his 



132 




 



grandchildren's salary for their 
fuH life-expectancy! And he 
doesn't have half the goods he's 
made up his mind to own! We'll 
work out something for him. 
Service to the customer is our job 
and we know it well." 

Carrin wavered visibly. 

"And after you're gone, sir, 
they'll all belong to your son." 

That was true, Carrin thought. 
His son would have all the marvelous things that filled the 
house. And after all, it was only 
thirty years out of a life expectancy of a hundred and fifty. 

He signed with a flourish. 

"Excellent!" Pathis said. "And 
by the way, has your home got 
an A. E. Master-operator?" 

It hadn't. Pathis explained that 
a Master-operator was new this 
year, a stupendous advance in 
scientific engineering. It was 
designed to take over all the functions of housecleaning and cooking, without its owner having to 
lift a finger. 

"Instead of running around all 
day, pushing half a dozen different buttons, with the Masteroperator all you have to do is 
push one! A remarkable achievement!" 

Since it was only five hundred 
and thirty-five dollars, Carrin 
signed for one, having it added 
to his son's debt. 

Right's right, he thought, walking Pathis to the door. This house 



will be Billy's some day. His and 
his wife's. They certainly will 
want everything up-to-date. 

Just one button, he thought. 
That would be a time-saver! 

A FTER Pathis left, Carrin sat 
back in an adjustable chair 
and turned on the solido. After 
twisting the Ezi-dial, he discovered that there was nothing he 
wanted to see. He tilted back the 
chair and took a nap. 

The something on his mind was 
still bothering him. 

"Hello, darling!" He awoke to 
find his wife was home. She kissed him on the ear, "Look," 

She had bought an A. E. Sexitizer-negligee. He was pleasantly 
surprised that that was all she 
had bought. Usually, Leela returned from shopping laden 
down. 

"It's lovely," he said. 

She bent over for a kiss, then 
giggled — a habit he knew she had 
picked up from the latest popular 
solido star. He wished she hadn't. 

"Going to dial supper," she 
said, and went to the kitchen. 
Carrin smiled, thinking that soon 
she would be able to dial the 
meals without moving out of the 
living room. He settled back in 
his chair, and his son walked in. 

"How's it going, Son?" he 
asked heartily. 

"All right," Billy answered listlessly. 



COST OF LIVING

"What'sa matter, Son?" The 
boy stared at his feet, not answering. "Come on, tell Dad what's 
the trouble." 

Billy sat down on a packing 
case and put his chin in his hands. 
He looked thoughtfully at his 
father. 

"Dad, could I be a Master Repairman if I wanted to be?" 

Mr. Carrin smiled at the question. Billy alternated between 
wanting to be a Master Repairman and a rocket pilot. The 
repairmen were the elite. It was 
their job to fix the automatic repair machines. The repair machines could fix just about 
anything, but you couldn't have 
a machine fix the machine that 
fixed the machine. That was 
where the Master Repairmen 
cameln. 

But it was a highly competitive 
field and only a very few of the 
best brains were able to get their 
degrees. And, although the boy 
was bright, he didn't seem to have 
an engineering bent. 

"It's possible. Son. Anything is 
possible." 

"But is it possible for me?" 

"I don't know," Carrin answered, as honestly as he could. 

"Well, I don't want to be a 
Master Repairman anyway," the 
boy said, seeing that the answer 
was no. "I want to be a space 
pilot." 

"A space pilot, Billy?" Leela 



asked, coming in to the room. 
"But there aren't any." 

"Yes, there are," Billy argued. 
"We were told in school that the 
government is going to send some 
men to Mars." 

"They've been saying that for 
a hundred years," Carrin said, 
"and they still haven't gotten 
around to doing it." 

"They will this time." 

"Why would you want to go to 
Mars?" Leela asked, winking at 
Carrin. "There are no pretty girls 
on Mars." 

"I'm not interested in girls. I 
just want to go to Mars." 

"You wouldn't like it, honey," 
Leela said. "It's a nasty old place 
with no air." 

"It's got some air. I'd like to 
go there," the boy insisted sullenly. "I don't like it here." 

"What's that?" Carrin asked, 
sitting up straight. "Is there anything you haven't got? Anything 
you want?" 

"No, sir. I've got everything I 
want." Whenever his son called 
him 'sir,' Carrin knew that something was wrong. 

"Look, Son, when I was your 
age I wanted to go to Mars, too. 
I wanted to do romantic things. 
I even wanted to be a Master 
Repairman." 

"Then why didn't you?" 

"Well, I grew up. I realized 
that there were more important 
things. First I had to pay off the 



134 




 



debt my father had left me, and 
then I met your mother — " 
Leela giggled. 

" — and I wanted a home of my 
own. It'll be the same with you. 
You'll pay off your debt and get 
married, the same as the rest of 
us." 

T>ILLY was silent for a while. 

then he brushed his dark hair 
— straight, like his father's — back 
from his forehead and wet his 
lips. 

"How come I have debts, sir?" 

Carrin explained carefully. 
About the things a family needed 
for civilized living, and the cost 
of those items. How they had to 
be paid. How it was customary 
for a son to take on a part of his 
parent's debt, when he came of 
age. 

Billy's silence annoyed him. It 
was almost as if the boy were reproaching him. After he had 
slaved for years to give the ungrateful whelp every luxury! 

"Son," he said harshly, "have 
you studied history in school? 
Good. Then you know how it 
was in the past. Wars. How would 
you like to get blown up in a 
war?" 

The boy didn't answer. 

"Or how would you like to 
break your back for eight hours 
a day, doing work a machine 
should handle? Or be hungry all 
the time? Or cold, with the rain 



beating down on you, and no 
place to sleep?" 

He paused for a response, got 
none and went on. "You live in 
the most fortunate age mankind 
has ever known. You are surrounded by every wonder of art 
and science. The finest music, the 
greatest books and art, all at your 
fingertips. All you have to do is 
push a button." He shifted to a 
kindlier tone. "Well, what are 
you thinking?" 

"I was just wondering how I 
could go to Mars," the boy said. 
"With the debt, I mean. I don't 
suppose I could get away from 
that." 

"Of course not." 

"Unless I stowed away on a 
rocket." 

"But you wouldn't do that." 

"No, of course not," the boy 
said, but his tone lacked conviction. 

"You'll stay here and marry a 
very nice girl," Leela told him. 

"Sure I will," Billy said. 
"Sure." He grinned suddenly. "I 
didn't mean any of that stuff 
about going to Mars. I really 
didn't." 

"I 'm glad of that," Leela 
answered. 

"Just forget I mentioned it," 
Billy said, smiling stiffly. He 
stood up and raced upstairs. 

"Probably gone to play with 
his rockets/* Leela said. "He's 
such a little devil." 



COST OF LIVING 



T"*HE Carrins ate a quiet supper, 
and then it was time for Mr. 
Carrin to go to work. He was on 
night shift this month. He kissed 
his wife good-by, climbed into 
his Jet-lash and roared to the 
factory. The automatic gates recognized him and opened. He 
parked and walked in. 

Automatic lathes, automatic 
presses — everything was automatic. The factory was huge and 
bright, and the machines hummed softly to themselves, doing 
their job and doing it well. 

Carrin walked to the end of 
the automatic washing machine 
assembly line, to relieve the man 
there. 

"Everything all right?" he 
asked. 

"Silre," the man said. "Haven't 
had a bad one all year. These 
new models here have built-in 
voices. They don't light up like 
the old ones." 

Carrin sat down where the man 
had sat and waited for the first 
washing machine to come 
through. His job was the soul of 
simplicity. He just sat there and 
the machines went by hirn. He 
pressed a button on them and 
found out if they were all right. 
They always were. After passing 
him, the washing machines went 
to the packaging section. 

The first one slid by on the 
long slide of rollers. He pressed 
the starting button on the side. 



"Ready for the wash," the 
washing machine said. 

Carrin pressed the release and 
let it go by. 

That boy of his, Carrin 
thought. Would he grow up and 
face his responsibilities? Would 
he mature and take his place in 
society? Carrin doubted it. The 
boy was a born rebel. If anyone 
got to Mars, it would be his kid. 

But the thought didn't especially disturb him. 

"Ready for the wash." Another machine went by. 

Carrin remembered something 
about Miller. The jovial man had 
always been talking about the 
planets, always kidding about 
going off somewhere and roughing it. He hadn't, though. He'd 
committed suicide. 

"Ready for the wash." 

Carrin had eight hours in front 
of him, and he loosened his belt 
to prepare for it. Eight hours of 
pushing buttons and listening to 
a machine announce its readiness. 

"Ready for the wash." 

He pressed the release. 

"Ready for the wash." 

Carrin's mind strayed from the 
job, which didn't need much attention in any case. He wished 
he had done what he had longed 
to do as a youngster. 

It would have been great to be 
a rocket pilot, to push a button 
and go to Mars.

THE DEEP 

By ISAAC ASIMOV 

It's an uphill job when a race has dug down 
fo the cooling core of its frigid world and 
must get out from under in order to survive. 



IN the end, any particular 
planet must die. It may be 
a quick death as its sun explodes. It may be a slow death 
as its sun sinks into decay and 
its oceans lock in ice. In the 
latter case, at least, intelligent life 
has a chance of survival. 

The direction of survival may 
be outward into space, to a planet 



closer to the cooling sun, or to a 
planet of another sun altogether. 
This particular avenue is closed if 
the planet is unfortunate enough 
to be the only habitable one rotating about its primary and if, 
at the time, no other star is within 
half a thousand light-years. 

The direction of survival may 
be inward, into the crust of the 




Illustrated by ASHMAN 



THE DEEP 



139 



planet. That is always available. 
A new home can be built underground and the heat of the 
planet's core can be tapped for 
energy. Thousands of years may 
be necessary for the task, but a 
dying sun cools slowly. 

Yet planetary warmth dies, 
too, with time. Burrows must be 
dug deeper and deeper until the 
planet is dead through and 
through. 

The time was coming. 

On the surface of the planet, 
wisps of neon blew listlessly, barely able to stir the pools of oxygen 
that collected in the lowlands. 
Occasionally, during the long day, 
the crusted sun would flare briefly 
into a dull red glow and the 
oxygen pools would bubble a 
little. 

During the long night, a bluewhite oxygen frost formed over 
the pools and on the bare rock, 
a neon dew formed. 

Eight hundred miles below the 
surface, a last bubble of warmth 
and life existed. 

I 

W^ENDA'S relationship to Roi 
was as close as one could 
imagine, closer by far than it was 
decent for her to know. 

She had been allowed to enter 
the ovarium only once in her 
life and it had been made quite 
clear to her that it was to be 



only that once. 

The Raceologist had said, "You 
don't quite meet the standards, 
Wenda, but you are fertile and 
that may be enough. We'll try 
you and see." 

She wanted it to work out. 
She wanted it desperately. Quite 
early in her life, she had known 
that she was deficient in intelligence, that she would never be 
more than a Manual. It embarrassed her that she should fail 
the Race and she longed for even 
a single chance to help create 
another being. It became an obsession. 

She secreted her egg in an angle 
of the structure and then returned 
to watch. The "randoming" process that moved the eggs gently 
about during mechanical insemination (to insure even gene-distribution) did not. by some good 
fortune, do more than make her 
own wedged-in egg wobble a bit. 

Unobtrusively, she maintained 
her watch during the period of 
maturation, observed the little 
one that emerged from the particular egg that was hers, noted 
his physical markings, watched 
him grow. 

He was a healthy youngster 
and the Raceologist approved of 
him. 

She had said once, very casually, "Look at that one, the one 
sitting there. Is he sick?" 

"Which one?" The Raceologist 



140 




 



was startled. Visibly sick infants 
at this stage would be a strong 
reflection upon his own competence. "You mean Roi? Nonsense. 
I wish all our young were like 
him." 

At first, she was only pleased 
with herself, then frightened, 
finally horrified as she found herself haunting the youngster while 
he grew, taking an interest in 
his schooling, watching him at 
play. She was happy when he 
was near, dull and unhappy 
otherwise. She had never heard of 
such a thing, and she was 
ashamed. 

SHE should have visited the 
Mentalist, but she knew better. She was not so dull that she 
didn't know this was not a mild 
aberration to be cured at the 
twitch of a brain cell. It was a 
truly psychotic manifestation. 
She was certain of that. They 
would confine her if they found 
out. They would euthanase her, 
perhaps, as a useless drain on the 
strictly limited energy available 
to the Race. They might even 
euthanese the offspring of her 
egg, if they found out who it was. 
* She fought the abnormality 
through the years and, to a measure, succeeded. Then she first 
heard the news that Roi had been 
chosen for the long trip, and she 
once again was filled with aching 
misery. 



SHE followed him to one of the 
empty corridors of the cavern, 
some miles from the city center. 
The city — there was only one. 

This particular cavern had been 
closed down within Wenda's own 
memory. The Elders had paced 
its length, considered its population and the energy necessary to 
keep it powered, then decided to 
darken it. The population — not 
many, to be sure — had been 
moved closer toward the center, 
and the quota for the next 
session at the Ovarium had been 
cut. 

Wenda found Roi's conversational level of thinking shallow, 
as though most of his mind had 
drawn inward contemplatively. 

"Are you afraid?" she thought 
at him. 

"Because I come out here to 
ponder?" He hesitated a little, 
then admitted. "Yes, I am. It's 
the Race's last chance. If I fail — " 

"Are you afraid for yourself?" 

He looked at her in astonishment and Wenda's thought stream fluttered with shame at 
her indecency. 

She said, "I wish I were going 
instead." 

"Do you think you can do a 
better job?" 

"Oh, no. But if / were to fail 
and — and never come back, it 
would be a smaller loss to the 
Race." 

"The loss is exactly the same," 



THE DEEP 



141 



he said, stolidly, "whether it's 
you or I. The toss is Racial existence." 

Racial existence at the moment 
was in the background of Wenda's 
mind, if anywhere. 

She sighed. "The trip is such 
a long one." 

"How long?" he asked with a 
smile. "Do you know?" 

She hesitated. She dared not 
appear stupid to him. 

She said, primly. "The common talk is that it is to the First 
Level." 

When Wenda had been little 
and the heated corridors had extended farther out of the City, 
she had wandered out, exploring, 
as youngsters will. One day, a 
long distance out, where the chill 
in the air nipped at her, she 
came*to a hall that slanted upward, but was blocked almost 
instantly by a tremendous plug, 
wedged tightly from top to bottom and side to side. 

On the other side and upward, 
she had learned a long time later, 
lay the Seventy-ninth Level, 
above that the Seventy-eighth, 
and so on. 

"We're going past the First 
Level, Wenda." 

"But there's nothing beyond 
that!" she protested. 

"You're right. Nothing. All the 
solid matter of the planet comes 
to an end." 

"But how can there be any


thing that's nothing? You mean 
air?" 

"No, I mean nothing. Vacuum. 
You know what vacuum is, don't 
you?" 

"Yes. But vacuums have to be 
pumped and kept airtight." 

"That's good reasoning for a 
Manual. Still, past the First Level 
there is just an indefinite amount 
of vacuum stretching everywhere." 

Wenda thought a while. She 
said, "Has anyone ever been 
there?" 

"Naturally not. But we have 
the records." 

"Maybe the records are wrong." 

"They can't be. Do you know 
how much space I'm going to 
cross?" 

Wenda's thought -stream indicated an overwhelming negative. 

Roi said, "You know the speed 
of light, I suppose ?" 

"Of course," she replied, readily. It was a universal constant 
that even Infants knew. "One 
thousand nine hundred and fiftyfour times the length of the cavern and back in one second." 

"Right," said Roi. "but if light 
were to travel along the distance 
I'm to cross, it would take it ten 
years." 

" Wenda said, "You're making 
fun of me. You're trying to frighten me." 

"Why should it frighten you?" 
He rose. "Well, I've been moping 



142 




 



here long enough — " 

For a moment, one of his six 
grasping limbs rested lightly in 
one of hers, with an objective, 
impassive friendship. An irrational impulse urged Wenda to 
seize it tightly, prevent him from 
leaving. 

She panicked for a moment in 
fear that he might probe her mind 
past the conversational level, that 
he might sicken and never face 
her again, that he might even 
report her for treatment. Then 
she relaxed. Roi was normal, not 
sick like herself. He would never 
dream of penetrating a friend's 
mind any deeper than the conversational level, whatever the 
provocation. 

He was very handsome in her 
eyes as he walked away, His 
grasping limbs were straight and 
strong, his prehensile, manipulative vibrissae were numerous and 
delicate, and his optic patches 
were more beautifully opalescent 
than any she had ever seen. 

II 

T AURA settled down in her 
seat. How soft and comfortable they made them ! How 
pleasing and unfrightening airplanes were on the inside, so 
different from the hard, silvery, 
inhuman luster of the outside! 

The bassinet was on the seat 
beside her. She peeped in past 



the blanket and the tiny, ruffled 
cap. Walter was sleeping. His face 
was the blank, round softness of 
infancy and his eyelids, were two 
fringed half-moons pulled down 
over his eyes. 

A tuft of light brown hair 
straggled across his forehead and, 
with infinite delicacy, Laura 
drew it back beneath his cap. 

It would soon be Walter's feeding time and she hoped he was 
still too young to be upset by 
the strangeness of his surroundings. The stewardess was being 
very kind. She even kept his 
bottles in a little refrigerator. 
Imagine, a refrigerator on board 
an airplane! 

The people in the seat across 
the aisle had been watching her 
in that peculiar way that meant 
they would love to talk to her if 
only they could think of an excuse. The moment came when she 
lifted Walter out of his bassinet 
and placed him, a little lump of 
pink flesh encased in a white 
cocoon of cotton, upon her lap. 

A baby is always legitimate as 
an opening for conversation between strangers. 

The lady across the way said 
(her words were predictable) , 
"What a lovely child. How old 
is he, my dear?" 

Laura said, through the pins in 
her mouth (she had spread a 
blanket across her knees and was 
changing Walter), "He'll be -four 



THE DEEP 



143 



months old next week." 

Walter's eyes were open and 
he simpered across at the woman, 
opening his mouth in a wet, 
gummy grin. (He always enjoyed 
being changed.) 

"Look at him smile, George," 
said the lady. 

Her husband smiled back and 
twiddled fat fingers. 

"Goo," he said. 

Walter laughed in a highpitched hiccupy way. 

"What's his name, dear?" 
asked the woman. 

"He's Walter Michael," Laura 
said, then added, "After his 
father." 

The floodgates were now down. 
Laura learned that the couple 
were George and Eleanor Ellis, 
that they were on their vacation, 
that They had three children, two 
girls and one boy, all grown up. 
Both girls had married and one 
had two children of her own. 

Laura listened with a pleased 
expression on her thin face. 
Walter (senior, that is) had always said that it was because 
she was such a good listener 
that he had first grown interested 
in her. 

WALTER was getting restless. 
Laura freed his arms in 
order to let some of his feelings 
evaporate in muscular effort. 

"Would you warm the bottle, 
please?" she asked the stewardess. 



Under strict but friendly questioning, Laura explained the number of feedings Walter was currently enjoying, the exact nature 
of his formula, and whether he 
suffered from diaper rash. 

"I hope his little stomach isn't 
upset today ," she worried . ' ' I 
mean the plane motion, you 
know." 

"Oh, Lord," said Mrs. Ellis, 
"he's too young to be bothered 
by that. Besides, these large 
planes are wonderful. Unless I 
look out the window, I wouldn't 
believe we were in the air. Don't 
you feel that way, George?" 

But Mr. Ellis, a blunt, straightforward man, said, "I'm surprised 
you take a baby that age on a 
plane." 

Mrs. Ellis turned to frown at 
him. 

Laura held Walter over her 
shoulder and patted his back 
gently. The beginnings of a soft 
wail died down as his little fingers 
found themselves in his mother's 
smooth, blonde hair and began 
grubbing into the loose bun that 
lay at the back of her neck. 

She said, "I'm taking him to 
his father. Walter's never seen his 
son yet." 

Mr. Ellis looked perplexed and 
began a comment, but Mrs. Ellis 
put in quickly. "Your husband 
is in the Service, I suppose?" 

"Yes, he is." 

Mr. Ellis opened his mouth in 



144 




 



a soundless "Oh" and subsided. 

Laura went on, "He's stationed 
just outside Davao and he's going 
to be meeting me at Nichols 
Field." 

Before the stewardess returned 
with the bottle, they had discovered that her husband was a master sergeant with the Quartermaster Corps, that he had been 
in the Army for four years, that 
they had been married for two, 
that he was about to be discharged, and that they would 
spend a long honeymoon in the 
Philippines before returning to 
San Francisco. 

Then she had the bottle. She 
cradled Walter in the crook of 
her left arm and put the bottle 
to his face. It slid right past his 
lips and his gums seized upon 
the nipple. Little bubbles began 
to work upward through the milk, 
while his hands batted ineffectively at the warm glass and his 
blue eyes stared fixedly up at her. 

Laura squeezed little Walter 
ever so slightly and thought how, 
with all the petty difficulties and 
annoyances that were involved, 
it yet remained such a wonderful 
thing to have a little baby all 
one's own. 

Ill 

THEORY, thought Gan, always 
theory. The folk of the surface, a million or more years 



ago, could see the Universe, could 
sense it directly. Now, with eight 
hundred miles of rock above their 
heads, the Race could only make 
deductions from the trembling 
needles of their instruments. 

It was only theory tHat brain 
cells, in addition to their ordinary electric potentials, radiated another sort of energy 
altogether. Energy that was not 
electromagnetic and hence not 
condemned to the creeping pace of 
light. Energy that was associated 
with the highest functions of the 
brain and hence characteristic 
only of intelligent, reasoning creatures. 

It was a jogging needle that 
detected such an energy field 
leaking into their cavern, and 
other needles that pinpointed the 
origin of the field in such-andsuch a direction ten light-years 
distant. At least one star must 
have moved quite close in the 
time since the surface-folk had 
placed the nearest at five hundred 
light-years. Or was theory wrong? 

"Are you afraid?" Gan burst 
into the conversational level of 
thought without warning and impinged sharply on the humming 
surface of Roi's mind. 

Roi said, "It's a great responsibility." 

Gan thought: Others speak of 
responsibility. For generations, 
Head-Tech after Head-Tech had 
been working on the Resonizer 



THE DEEP 



145 



and the Receiving Station and it 
was in his time that the final step 
had to be taken. What did others 
know of responsibility? 

He said, "It is. We talk about 
Racial extinction glibly enough, 
yet we 'always assume it will 
come some day, not now, not in 
our time. But it will, do you 
understand? It will! What we 
are to do today will consume twothirds of our total energy supply. 
.There will not be enough left 
to try again. There will net be 
enough for this generation to live 
out its life. But that will not 
matter if you follow orders. We 
have thought of everything. We 
have spent generations thinking 
of everything." 

"I will do what I am told," 
said R^oi. 

"Your thought- field will be 
meshed against those coming 
from space. All thought-fields are 
characteristic of the individual 
and ordinarily the probability of 
any duplication is very low. But 
the fields from space number 
billions according to our best 
estimate. Your field is very likely 
to resemble one of tneirs. In 
that case, a resonance will be set 
up as long as our Resonizer is 
in operation. Do you know the 
principles involved?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Then you know that during 
resonance, your mind will be on 
Planet X in the brain of the 



creature with g thought -field 
identical to yours. That is not 
the energy-consuming process. In 
resonance with your mind we will 
also place the mass of the Receiving Station. The method of 
transferring mass in that manner 
was the last phase of the problem 
to be solved. It will take all the 
energy the Race would ordinarily 
use in a hundred years!" 

GAN picked up the black cube 
that was the Receiving Station and looked at it somberly. 
Three generations before, it had 
been thought impossible to manufacture one, with all the required 
properties, in a space less than 
twenty cubic yards. They had it 
now; it was the size of his fist. 

Gan said, "The thought-field 
of intelligent brain cells can only 
follow certain well-defined patterns. All living creatures', on 
whatever planet they develop, 
must possess a protein base and 
an oxygen- water chemistry. If 
their world is livable for them, 
it is livable for us." 

Theory, thought Gan on a 
deeper level, always theory, never 
evidence that could be checked. 
And what if the theory was 
wrong? 

He went on, "This does not 
mean that the body you find 
yourself in — its mind and its emotions — may not be completely 
alien. So we have arranged for 



146 




 



three methods of activating the 
Receiving Station. If you are 
strong-limbed, you need only exert five hundred pounds of pressure on any face of the cube. If 
you are delicate-limbed, you need 
only press a knob which you 
can reach through this single 
opening in the cube. If you are 
no-limbed, if your host body is 
paralyzed or in any other way 
helpless, you can activate the 
Station by mental energy alone. 
Once the Station is activated, we 
will have two points of reference, 
not one, and the Race can be 
transferred to Planet X by ordinary teleportation." 

"That," said Roi, "will mean 
we will use electromagnetic energy." 

"And so?" 

"It will take us ten years to 
transfer." 

"We will not be aware of 
duration." 

"I realize that, sir, but it will 
mean the Station will remain on 
Planet X for ten years. What if 
it is destroyed in the meantime?" 

"We have thought of that, too. 
We have thought of everything. 
Once the Station is activated, it 
will generate a para-mass field. 
It will move in the direction of 
gravitational attraction, sliding 
through ordinary matter, until 
such time as a continuous medium of relatively high density 
exerts sufficient friction to stop it. 



It will take twenty feet of rock as 
we know it to do that. Anything 
of lower density won't affect it. 
It will remain twenty feet underground for ten years, at which 
tims- a counter-field will bring it 
to the surface. Then the Race 
will appear." 

"In that case, why not make 
the activation of the Station automatic? It has so many automatic attributes already — " 

"You haven't thought it 
through, Roi. We have. Not all 
spots on the surface of Planet X 
may be suitable. If the inhabitants are powerful and advanced, 
you may have to find an unobtrusive place for the Station. It 
won't do for us to appear in a 
city square, for example. And you 
will have to be certain that the 
immediate environment is not 
dangerous in other ways." 

"What other ways, sir?" 

"I don't knQW. The ancient 
records of the surface refer to 
many things we no longer understand. They don't explain because 
they took those phenomena for 
granted, but we have been away 
from the surface for almost a 
hundred thousand generations 
and we are puzzled. Our Techs 
aren't even in agreement on the 
physical nature of stars, and that 
is something the records mention 
and discuss frequently. But what 
are 'storms,' 'earthquakes,' 'volcanoes,* 'tornadoes,* 'sleet,' 'land


TH E DEEP 



147 



slides,' 'floods,' 'lightning' and so 
on? These are all terms which 
refer to surface phenomena that 
are dangerous* but we don't know 
what they are. We have no idea 
Of how to guard against them. 
Through your host's mind, you 
may be able to learn what is 
needful and take appropriate action." 

"How much time will I have, 
sir?" 

"The Resonizer cannot be kept 
in continuous operation for longer 
than twelve hours. I would prefer 
that you complete your job in 
two. You will return here automatically as soon as the Station 
is activated. Are you ready?" 

"I'm ready," said Roi. 

Gan led the way to the clouded 
glass cabinet. Roi took his seat, 
arranged his limbs in the appropriate depressions. His vibrissae 
dipped in mercury for good contact. 

Roi said, "What if I find myself in a body on the point of 
death?" 

Gan said, as he adjusted the 
controls, "The thought-field is 
distorted when a person is near 
death. No normal thought -field 
such as yours would be in 
resonance." 

"And if it is on the point of 
accidental death?" 

"We have thought of that, too. 
We can't guard against it, but 
the chance of death following so 



quickly that you have no time 
to activate the Station mentally 
is estimated as less than one in 
twenty trillion, unless the mysterious surface dangers are more 
deadly than we expect. You have 
one minute." 

For some strange reason, Roi's 
last thought before translation 
was of Wenda. 

IV 

1" AURA awoke with a sudden 
start. What had happened? 
She felt as though she had been 
jabbed with a pin. 

The afternoon sun was shining 
in her face and its dazzle made 
her blink. She lowered the shade 
and simultaneously bent to look 
at Walter. 

She was a little surprised to 
find his eyes open. This wasn't 
one of his waking periods. She 
looked at her wristwatch. No, it 
wasn't. And it was a good hour 
before feeding time, too. She followed the demand-feeding or 
the "if-you-want-it-holler-andyou'll-get-it" system, but ordinarily Walter followed the clock 
quite conscientiously. 

She wrinkled her nose at him. 
"Hungry, duckie?" 

Walter did not respond at all 
and Laura was disappointed. She 
would have liked to have him 
smile. Actually, she wanted him 
to laugh and throw his pudgy 



148 




 



arms about her neck and nuzzle 
her and say, "Mommie," but she 
knew he couldn't do any of that. 
He could smile, though. 

She put a light finger to his 
chin and tapped it a bit. "Googoo-goo-goo." He always smiled 
when she did that. 

But he only blinked at her. 

She said, "I hope he isn't sick." 
She looked at Mrs. Ellis in distress. 

Mrs. Ellis put down a magazine. "Is anything wrong, my 
dear?" 

"I don't know. Walter just lies 
there." 

"Poor little thing. He's tired, 
probably." 

"Shouldn't he be sleeping, 
then?" 

"He's in strange surroundings. 
He's probably wondering what 
it's all about." 

SHE rose, stepped across the 
aisle, and leaned across Laura 
to bring her own face close to 
Walter's. "You're wondering 
what's going on, you tiny little 
snookums. Yes, you are. You're 
saying, 'where's my nice little crib 
and all my nice little funnies on 
the wallpaper?' " 

Then she made little squeaking 
sounds at him. 

Walter turned his eyes away 
from his mother" and watched 
Mrs. Ellis somberly. 
Mrs. Ellis straightened sudden


ly and looked distressed. She put 
a hand to her head for a moment 
and murmured, "Goodness! The 
queerest pain." 

"Do you think he's hungry?" 
asked Laura. 

"Lord," said Mrs. Ellis, the 
trouble in her face fading, "they 
let you know when they're hungry 
soon enough. There's nothing 
wrong with him. I've had three 
children, dear. I know." 

"I think I'll ask the Stewardess 
to warm up another bottle." 

"Well, if it will make you feel 
better — " 

The stewardess brought the 
bottle and Laura lifted Walter 
out of his bassinette. She said, 
"You have your bottle and then 
I'll change you and then—" 

She adjusted his head in the 
crook of her elbow, leaned over to 
peck him quickly on the cheek, 
then cradled him close to her 
body as she brought the bottle 
to his lips. 

Walter screamed! 

His mouth stretched open, his 
arms pushed before him with his 
fingers spread wide, his whole 
body as stiff and hard as though 
in tetany, and he screamed. It 
rang through the whole compartment. 

Laura screamed, too. She dropped the bottle and it smashed 
with a white splash. 

Mrs. Ellis jumped up. Half a 
dozen others did, too. Mr. Ellis 



THE DEEP 



!49 




150 




 



snapped out of a light doze. 

"What's the matter?" asked 
Mrs. Ellis, blankly. 

"I don't know. I don't know." 
Laura was shaking Walter frantically, putting him over her 
shoulder, patting his back. "Baby, 
baby, don't cry. Baby, what's 
the matter? Baby — " 

The stewardess was dashing 
down the aisle. Her foot came 
within an inch of the cube that sat 
beneath Laura's seat. 

Walter was threshing about 
furiously now, yelling with calliope intensity and red -faced 
rage. 

V 

ROI'S mind flooded with shock. 
One moment he had been 
strapped in his chair in contact 
with the clear mind of Gan; the 
next (there was no consciousness 
of separation in time) he was 
immersed in a medley of strange, 
barbaric and broken thought. 

He closed his mind completely. 
It had % been open wide to increase the effectiveness of resonance, and the first touch of the 
alien had been — 

Not painful, no. Dizzying? 
Nauseating? No, not that, either. 
There was no word. 

He gathered resilience in the 
quiet nothingness of mind-closure 
and considered his position. He 
felt the small touch of the re


ceiving station with which he 
was in mental liaison. That had 
come with him. Good! 

He ignored his host for the 
moment. He might need him for 
drastic operations later, so it 
would be wise to raise no suspicions for the moment. 

He explored. He entered a mind 
at random and took stock first of 
the sense-impressions that permeated it. The creature was sensitive to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and to vibrations 
of the air and, of course, to bodily contact. It possessed localized 
chemical senses — 

And that was all! 

He looked again in astonishment. Not only was there no direct mass-sense, no electro-potential sense, none of the really 
refined interpreters of the Universe, but there was no mental 
contact whatever. 

The creature's mind was completely isolated. 

Then how did they communicate? He looked further. They 
had a complicated code of controlled air vibrations. 

Were they intelligent? Had he 
chosen a maimed mind? No, they 
were all like that. 

He filtered the group of surrounding minds through his mental tendrils, searching for a Tech, 
or whatever passed for such 
among these crippled semi-intelligences. He found a mind which 



THE DEEP 



151 



thought of itself as a controller 
of vehicles. A piece of information flooded Roi. He was on an 
airborne vehicle. 

Then even without mental contact, they could build a rudimentary mechanical civilization. 
Or were they animal tools of real 
intelligences elsewhere on the 
planet? No, their minds said. 

He plumbed the Tech. What 
about the immediate environment? Were the bugbears of the 
ancients to be feared? It was a 
matter of interpretation. Dangers 
in the environment existed. Movements of air. Changes of temperature. ^ Water falling in the air, 
either as liquid or solid. Electrical 
discharges. There were codevibrations for each phenomenon, 
but that meant nothing. The connection of any of these with the 
names given to phenomena by the 
ancestral surface-folk was a matter of conjecture. 

No matter. Was there danger 
now? Was there danger here? 
Was there any cause for fear? 

The Tech's mind said there 
wasn't. 

That was enough. He returned 
to his host-mind and rested a 
moment, then cautiously expanded— 

Nothing! 

TTIS host-mind was blank. At 
most there was a vague sense 
of warmth and a dull flicker of 



undirected response to basic 
stimuli. 

Was his host dying, after all? 
Aphasic? Decerebrate? 

He moved quickly to the mind 
nearest, dredging it for information about his host, and shockedly finding it. 

His host was an infant of the 
species. 

An infant? A normal infant? 
And so undeveloped? 

He allowed his mind to sink 
into and coalesce for a moment 
with what existed in his host. 
He searched for the motor areas 
of the brain and found them 
with difficulty. A cautious stimulus was followed by an erratic 
motion of his host's extremities. 
He attempted finer control and 
failed. 

He felt anger. Had the Techs 
really thought of everything? Had 
they thought of intelligences without mental contact? Had they 
thought of young creatures as 
completely undeveloped as 
though they were still in the egg? 

It meant, of course, that he 
could not, in the person of his 
host, activate the Receiving Station. The muscles and mind were 
far too weak, far too uncontrolled for any of the three methods outlined by Gan. 

He thought intensely. He could 
scarcely expect to influence much 
mass through the imperfect focusing of his host's material brain 



152 




 



cells, but what about an indirect 
influence through an adult's brain. 
Direct physical influence would 
be minute; it would amount to 
the breakdown of the appropriate 
molecules of adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine. Thereafter the adult creature would 
act on its own. 

He hesitated to try this, afraid 
of failure, then cursed himself for 
a coward. He entered the closest 
mind once more. It was a female 
of the species and it was in the 
state of temporary inhibition he 
had noticed in others. It didn't 
surprise him. Minds as rudimentary as these would need periodic 
respites. 

He considered the mind before 
him now, mentally fingering the 
areas that might respond to stimulation. He chose one, stabbed at 
it, and the conscious areas flooded 
with life almost simultaneously. 
Sense impressions poured in and 
the level of thought rose steeply. 

Good! 

But not good enough. That was 
a mere prod, a pinch. It was no 
order for specific action. 

He stirred uncomfortably as 
emotion cascaded over him. It 
came from the mind he had just 
stimulated and was directed, of 
course, at his host and not at him. 
Nevertheless, its primitive crudities annoyed him and he closed 
his mind against the unpleasant 
warmth of her uncovered feelings. 



A second mind centered about 
his host and, had he been material or had he controlled a 
satisfactory host, he would have 
struck out in vexation. 

Great Caverns, weren't they 
going to allow him to concentrate on his serious business? 

He thrust sharply at the second mind, activating centers of 
discomfort, and it moved away. 

He was pleased. That had been 
more than a simple, undefined 
stimulation, and it had worked 
nicely. He had cleared the mental 
atmosphere. 

TTE returned to the Tech who 
controlled the vehicle. That 
one would know the details concerning the surface over which 
they were passing. 
Water? 

He sorted the data quickly. 

Water! And more water! 

By the everlasting Levels — the 
word "ocean" made sense. The 
old, traditional word "ocean." 
Who would dream that so much 
water could exist? 

But if this was "ocean," then 
the traditional word "island" had 
an obvious significance. He thrust 
his whole mind into the quest 
for geographical information. The 
"ocean" was speckled with dots 
of land, but he needed exact 
data — 

He was interrupted by a short 
stab of surprise as his host moved 



THE DEEP 



!53 



through space, and was held 
against the neighboring female's 
body. 

Roi's mind, engaged as it was, 
lay open and unguarded. In full 
intensity, the female's emotions 
piled in upon him. 

Roi winced. In an attempt to 
remove the distracting animal 
passions, he clamped down upon 
the host's brain cells through 
which the rawness was funneling. 

He did that too quickly, too 
energetically. His host's mind 
flooded with a diffuse pain, and 
instantly almost every mind he 
could reach reacted to the airvibrations that resulted. 

In vexation, he tried to blanket 
the pain and succeeded only in 
stimulating it further. 

Through the clinging mental 
mist of his host's pain, he tried 
the Tech's minds, striving to prevent contact from slipping out of 
■ focus. 

His mind went icy. The best 
chance was almost now! He had 
perhaps twenty minutes. There 
would be other chances afterward, 
but not as good. Yet he dared 
not attempt to direct the actions 
of another while his host's mind 
was in such complete disorganization. 

He retired, withdrew into mindclosure, maintaining only the 
most tenuous connection with 
his host's spinal cells, and waited. 

Minutes passed and little by 



little he returned to fuller liaison. 
He had five minutes left. 
He chose a subject. 

VI 

HPHE stewardess said, "I think 
he's beginning to feel a little 
better, poor little thing." 

"He never acted like this before," insisted Laura, tearfully. 
"Never." 

"He just had a little colic, I 
guess," said the stewardess. 

"Maybe he's bundled up too 
much," suggested Mrs. Ellis. 

"Maybe," agreed the stewardess. "It's quite warm." 

She unwrapped the blanket and 
lifted the nightgown to expose a 
heaving abdomen, pink and bulbous. Walter was still whimpering. 

The stewardess said, "Shall I 
change him for you? He's quite 
wet." 

"Would you, please?" 

Most of the nearer passengers 
had returned to their seats. The 
more distant ceased craning their 
necks. 

Mr. Ellis remained in the aisle 
with his wife. He said, "Say, 
look." 

Laura and the stewardess were 
too busy to pay him attention 
and Mrs. Ellis ignored him out of 
sheer habit. 

Mr. Ellis was used to that. His 
remark was purely rhetorical, 
anyway. He bent over and tugged 



154 




 



at the box beneath the seat. 

Mrs. Ellis looked down impatiently. She said, "Goodness, 
George, don't be dragging at other 
people's luggage like that. Sit 
down. You're in the way." 

Mr. Ellis straightened in confusion. 

Laura, with eyes still red and 
weepy, said, "It isn't mine. I 
didn't even know it was under 
the seat." 

The stewardess, looking up 
from the whining baby, asked, 
"What isit?" 

Mr. Ellis shrugged. "It's a box." 

His wife said, "Well, what do 
you want with it, for Heaven's 
sake?" 

Mr. Ellis- groped for a reason. 
What did he want with it? He 
mumbled, "I was just curious." 

The stewardess said, "There, 
the little boy is all nice and dry, 
and I'll bet in two minutes he'll 
just be as happy as anything. 
Hmm? Won't you, little funnyface?" 

But little funny-face was still 
sobbing. He turned his head away 
sharply as the bottle was once 
more offered to him. 

The stewardess said, "Let me 
warm it a bit. It's probably too 
cold for him now." 

She took it and went back 
down the aisle, 

Mr. Ellis came to a decision. 
Firmly, he lifted the box and 
balanced it on the arm of his 



seat. He ignored his wife's frown. 

He said, "I'm not doing it any 
harm. I'm just looking. What's 
it made of, anyway?" 

TTE rapped it with his knuckles. 

None of the other passengers 
seemed interested. They paid no 
attention to either Mr. Ellis or 
the box. It was as though something had switched off that particular line of interest among 
them. Even Mrs. Ellis, in conversation with Laura, kept her back 
to him. 

Mr. Ellis tipped the box up and 
found the opening. He knew it 
had to have an opening. It was 
large enough for him to insert a 
finger, though there was no reason, of course, why he should 
want to put a finger into a strange 
box. 

Carefully, he reached in. There 
was a black knob which he irrationally longed to touch. He 
pressed it. 

The box shuddered and was 
suddenly out of his hands and 
passing through the arm of the 
chair. 

He caught another glimpse of it 
moving through the floor and 
then there was unbroken flooring 
and nothing more. Slowly, he 
spread out . his hands and stared 
at his palms. Dropping to his 
knees, he felt the floor. 

The stewardess, returning with 
the bottle, asked politely, "Have 



THE DEEP 



155 



you lost something, sir?" 

Mrs. Ellis, looking down, said, 
"George!" 

Mr. Ellis heaved himself upward. He was flushed and flustered. He said, "The box — It slipped out and went down — " 

The stewardess said, "What 
box, sir?" 

Laura said, "May I have the 
bottle, miss? He's stopped crying." 

"Certainly. Here it is." 

Walter opened his mouth eagerly, accepting the nipple. Air 
bubbles moved upward through 
the milk and there were little 
swallowing sounds. 

Laura looked up, radiantly. 
"He seems fine now. Thank you, 
Stewardess, and you, Mrs. Ellis. 
For a while there, it almost 
seemefl" as though he weren't my 
little boy." 

"He'll be all right," said Mrs. 
Ellis. "Maybe it was just a bit' 
of air-sickness. Sit down, George." 

The stewardess said, "Just call 
me if you need me." , 

"Thank you," said Laura. ' 

Mr. Ellis said, "The box — V and 
stopped. 

What box? He didn't remember 
any box. 

BUT one mind aboard the 
plane could follow the black 
cube as it dropped in a parabola, 
unimpeded by wind or air resistance, passing through the 



molecules of gas that lay in 
its way. 

Below it, the atoll was a tiny 
bull's-eye in a huge target. Once, 
during a time of war, it had 
boasted an airstrip and barracks. 
The barracks had collapsed, the 
airstrip was a vanishing ragged 
line, and the atoll was empty. 

The cube struck the feathery 
foliage of a palm and not a frond 
was disturbed. It passed through 




5 56 




 



the trunk and down to the coral. 
It sank straight into the planet 
without the smallest fog of dust 
kicked up to tell of its entrance. 

Far below the surface of the 
soil, the cube passed into stasis 
and remained motionless, mingled 
intimately with the atoms of 
compressed rock, yet remaining 
distinct. 

That was all. It was night, then 
day. It rained, the wind blew, 



and the Pacific waves broke 
whitely -on the white coral. Nothing had happened. 

Nothing would happen — for ten 
years. 

VII 

^ \% /E have broadcast the 
news," said Gan, "that 
you have succeeded. I think you 
ought to rest now." 




Roi said, "Rest? Now? When 
I'm back with complete minds? 
Thank you, but no. The enjoyment is too keen." 

"Did intelligence without mental contact bother you so much?" 

"Yes," said Roi, shortly. 

Gan tactfully refrained from 
attempting to follow the line of 
retreating thought. 

Instead, he asked, "And the 
surface?" 

Roi said, "Entirely horrible. 
What the ancients called 'sun' is 
an unbearable patch of brilliance 
overhead . It is apparently a 
source of light and varies periodically: 'day' and 'night,' in other 
words. There is also unpredictable variation." 

" 'Clouds,' perhaps," said Gan. 

"Why 'clouds'?" 

"You know the traditional 
phrase: 'Clouds hid the sun.' " 

"You think so? Yes, it could 
be." 

"Well, go on." 

"Let's see. 'Ocean' and 'island' 
I've explained. 'Storm' involves 
wetness in the air, falling in drops. 
'Wind' is a movement of air on 
a huge scale. 'Thunder' is either 
a spontaneous static discharge in 
the air or a great spontaneous 
noise. 'Sleet' is falling ice." 

GA"N said, "That's a curious 
one. Where would ice fall 
from? How? Why?" 

"I haven't the slightest idea. 



It's all very variable. It will storm 
at one time and not at another. 
There are apparently regions on 
the surface where it is always 
cold, others where it is always hot, 
still others where it is both at 
different times*-" ' 

"Astonishing. How much, of 
this do you suppose is misinterpretation of alien minds?" 

"None. I'm sure of that. It was 
all quite plain. I had sufficient 
time to plumb their queer minds. 
Too much time, as a matter of 
fact." - 
Again his thoughts drifted back 
into privacy. 

Gan said, "This is excellent, 
Roi. I've been afraid all along 
of our tendency to romanticize 
the so-called Golden Age of our 
surface ancestors. I felt that there 
would be a strong impulse among 
our group in favor of a new surface life." 

"No," said Roi, vehemently. 

"Obviously not. I doubt if the 
hardiest among us would consider even a day of life in an environment such as you describe 
with its storms, days, nights, its 
indecent and unpredictable variations in environment." Gan's 
thoughts were contented ^ones. 
"Tomorrow we begin the process 
of transfer. Once on the island — 
an uninhabited one, you say?" 

"Entirely uninhabited. It was 
only one of that type the vessel 
passed over. The Tech's informa



 



tion was detailed." 

"Good. We will begin excavating operations. It will take generations, of course, but in the 
end, we will be" in the Deep of a 
new, warm world, in pleasant 
caverns where the controlled environment will be conducive to 
the growth of every culture and 
refinement." 

"And," added Roi, "no contact 
whatever with the surface creatures." 

Gan said, "Why that? Primitive though they are, they might 
be of help to us once we establish 
our base. A race that can build 
aircraft must have some abilities." 

"It isn't that. They're a belligerent lot, sir. They would attack 
with animal ferocity at all occasions and — " 

Gan interrupted. "I am disturbed at the psycho -penumbra 
that surrounds your references to 
the aliens. There's something you 
are concealing." 

ROI said, "I thought at first 
we could make use of them. 
If they wouldn't allow us to be 
friends, at least we could control them. I made one of thdm 
close the contact inside the cube 
and that was difficult. Very difficult. Their minds are basically 
different." 

"In what way?" 

"If I could describe it, the 



difference wouldn't be basic. But 
I can give you an example. I was 
in the mind of an infant. They 
cion't have maturation chambers. 
The infants are in the charge 
of individuals. The creature who 
was in charge of my host — " He 
stopped in disgust. 

"Yes?" Gan encouraged. 

"She — it was a female — felt a 
special tie to the young one. There 
was a sense of ownership, of a 
relationship that excluded the 
remainder of their society. I 
seemed to detect dimly something 
of the emotion that binds a man 
to an associate or friend, but it 
was far more intense and un- t 
restrained." 

"Well," said Gan, "without 
mental contact, they probably 
have no real conception of society, and sub-relationships may 
build up. Or was this one pathological?" 

"No, no. It's universal. The female in charge was the infant's 
mother." 

"Impossible! It's own mother?" 

"Of necessity. The infant had 
passed the first part of its existence inside its mother. Physically 
inside! The creatures' eggs remain within the body. They are 
fertilized within the body. They 
grow within the body and emerge 
alive." 

"Great Caverns!" Gan said, 
weakly. His own sense of revulsion was as strong as Roi's. "Then

each creature would know the 
identity of its own child! Each 
child would have a specific father!" 

"And he would be known, too. 
My host was being taken five 
thousand miles, as nearly as I 
could judge the distance, to be 
seen by its father." 

"Unbelievable!" 

"Do you need more to realize 
that there can never be any meeting of minds? The difference is 
too fundamental, too complete." 

The yellowness of regret tinged 
and roughened Gan's thoughttrain. He said, "It would be too 
bad. I had thought — " 

"What, sir?" 

"I had thought that for the 
first time there would be two intelligences helping one another. 
T had thought that together we 
might progress more quickly than 



either could alone. Even if they 
were primitive technologically, as 
they are, technology isn't everything. I had thought we might 
still be able to learn from them." 

"Learn what?" asked Roi, brutally. "To know our parents and 
make friends of our children?" 

Gan said, "No, no ! You're 
quite right. The barrier between 
us must remain forever complete. 
They will have the surface and 
we the Deep, and so it will be."

What Strange Powers 
Did The Ancients Possess? 



CVERY important discovery relating 
to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and write. 

Much has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and sue 
cessful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of 1% of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiv 
ing basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fundamentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weak* 
nesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example; The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in Hfe. 

You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of selfunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the high regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Cruris," abbreviated by the initials "AMORG." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a commercial organisation, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense. 

Not For General Distribution 

Sincere men and women, in search of 
the truth — -those who wish to fit in with 
the ways of the world — are invited to 
write for complimentary copy of the 
sealed booklet, "The Mastery of Life." 
It tells how to contact the librarian of 
the archives of AMORG for this rare 
knowledge. This booklet is not intended 
for general distribution; nor is it sent 
without request. It is therefore suggested 
that you write for your copy to: Scribe

The HOUSE 

□f MANY WORLDS 

By SAM MERWIN, Jr. 

When Picture Week writer Miss Elspeth Marriner and photographer Mack Fraser visited the mysterious old* house on 
Spindrift Key, in the Hatteras country, a supposedly routine story 
assignment turned suddenly into a fantastic adventure. 

For this house was actually a tangenitial point, or multiple 
gateway, to several worlds — worlds like our own, but varying 
slightly where similar crises and catastrophes in history had been 
resolved differently. 

* Elspeth and Mack learned that they had been brought here 
purposely, to help in an emergency which threatened the entire 
North American continent with war. They were to be used as 
secret agents of "The Workers," whose duty it was to look after 
the Earth in all its many parallel courses. 

Crossing into another world, aided only by their native ingenuity and the assistance of a fellow agent, the beauteous and 
knowable Juana, they encountered a succession of plots and 
counterplots, near brushes with death, and even romance. And 
before they completed their mission, they had to visit still a third 
world, where both tragedy and happiness awaited them. 

An exciting, modern science fiction story, with a new and 
highly unusual twist, THE HOUSE OF MANY WORLDS is outstanding for its realistic characters and expert seasoning of 
thrills and humor.
