RING AROUND THE SUNBy CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

VICKERS got up at an hour 
outrageous for its easiness because Ann had 
phoned the night before to tell 
him about a man in New York 
that she wanted him to meet. 

"I know it breaks into your 
schedule," she had said, "but I 



don't think this is something you 
can pass up." 

"I must, Ann," he'd told her. 
"I've got the writing going now 
and I can't let loose." 

"But this is the biggest thing 
that has ever broken. They picked you to talk to first, ahead of 



4 




 




all the other writers. They think 
you're the man to do it." 
"Publicity." 

"This is not publicity." 

"Forget it — I won't meet the 
guy, whoever he is," he had said 
and hung up before she could 
argue about it. 



He was frying eggs ana oacon 
and making toast and trying to 
keep one eye on the coffee maker, 
which was temperamental, when 
the doorbell rang. 

He wrapped his robe around 
him and headed for the door. 

It might be the newsboy. He 
had been out on the regular collection day and the boy probably 
had seen the light in the kitchen. 

Or it might be his neighbor, 
Horton Flanders, who had moved 
in a year or so ago and who dropped over to spend an idle hour at 
the most unexpected and inconvenient times. He was an affable 
old man and distinguished-looking, although slightly moth-eaten 
and shabby at the edges, pleasant 
to talk with and a good companion, but Vickers might have wished that he were more orthodox in 
his visiting. 

It might be the newsboy or it 
might be Flanders. It could 
scarcely be anyone else at this 
early hour. 

HE opened the door and a moppet stood there, wrapped in 
a cherry -colored bathrobe and 
with bunny rabbit slippers on her 
feet. Her hair was tousled from 
a night of sleep, but her blue eyes 
sparkled at him and she gave 
him a pretty smile. 

"Good morning, Mr. Vickers," 
she said. "I woke up and couldn't 
go back to sleep and I saw the 
light on in your kitchen and I 
thought maybe you was sick." 

"I'm all right, Jane," Vickers 
told her. "I'm just getting breakfast. Maybe you would like to eat 
with me." 

"Oh, yes," said Jane. "I was 
hoping maybe if you was having 



breakfast, you'd ask me to." 

"Your mother doesn't know 
you're here, does she?" 

"Mommy and Daddy are 
asleep. This is the day that 
Daddy doesn't work and they was 
out awful late last night. I heard 
then* when they came in and 
Mommy was telling Daddy that 
he drank too much and she said 
she wouldn't go out with him, 
never again, if he drank that 
much, and Daddy . . ." 

"Jane," said Vickers, firmly, "I 
don't think your mommy and 
daddy would like you t6 be telling this." 

"Oh, they don't care. Mommy 
talks about it all the time. I 
heard her telling Mrs. Traynor 
she had half a mind to divorce 
my daddy. Mr. Vickers, what is 
divorce?" 

"I can't recall ever hearing the 
word before. Maybe we oughtn't 
to talk about what your mommy 
says. And look, you got your 
slippers all wet crossing the 
grass." 

"It's kind of wet outside. The 
dew is awful heavy." 

"You come in," said Vickers, 
"and I'll dry your feet ( and then 
we'll have some breakfast and 
call your mommy so she'll know 
where you are." 

She came in and he closed the 
door. 

"You sit on that chair," he said, 
"and I'll get a towel. I'm afraid 




 



you might catch cold." 

"Mr. Vickers, you aren't married, are you?" 

"Why, no. It happens that I'm 
not." 

"Most everyone is married," 
said Jane. "Most everyone I 
know. Why aren't you married, 
Mr. Vickers?" 

"I don't rightly know. Never 
found a girl, I guess." 

"There are lots of girls." 

"There was a girl," said Vickers. "A long time ago, there was 
a girl." 

It had been years, he realized 
moodily, since he had remembered. He had forced the years 
to obscure the memory, to hide 
it away so that he did not think 
of it, and if he did think of it, 
to make it so far away and hazy 
that he could quit thinking of it. 

But here it was again. 

There had been a girl and an 
enchanted valley they had walked 
in, a springtime valley, he remembered, with the pink of wild 
crab apple blossoms flaming on 
the hills and the song of bluebird and of lark soaring in the 
sky, and there had been a wild 
spring breeze that ruffled the 
water and blew along the grass 
so that the meadow seemed to 
flow and become a lake with 
whitecaps rolling on it. 

They had walked in the valley 
and there was no doubt that it 
was enchanted, for when he had 



gone back again, the valley wasn't 
there — or at least not the same 
valley. It had been a very different valley. 

He had walked there twenty 
years ago and through all of 
twenty years he had hidden it 
away, back in the attic of his 
mind, yet now it had returned, as 
fresh and shining as if it had 
been only yesterday. 

"Mr. Vickers," said Jane, "I 
think your toast is burning." 

- II 

AFTER Jane had gone and he 
had washed the dishes, he remembered that he had intended 
for a week or more to call Joe 
about the mice. 

"You got what?" Joe asked 
when he phoned. 

"Mice," said Vickers. "Little 
animals. They run around the 
place. You never heard of a house 
with mice?" 

"Now that's funny," said Joe. 
"A well-built place like yours, it 
shouldn't have no mice. You want 
me to come over and get rid of 
them?" 

"I guess you'll have to. I tried 
traps, but these mice don't go for 
them. Got a cat a while back and 
the cat left. Only stayed a day or 
two." 

"That's a funny thing. Cats like 
places where they can catch a 
mouse." 



RING AROUND THE SUN

"This cat was crazy," said 
Vickers. "Acted like it was spooked. Walked around on tiptoe." 

"Cats is funny animals," Joe 
confided. 

"I'm going down to the city 
today. Figure you could do it 
while I'm gone?" 

"Sure thing. The exterminating 
business is kind of slack right 
now, I'll come over ten o'clock or 
so." 

"I'll leave the front door unlocked," said Vickers. 

He hung up the phone and got 
the paper off the stoop. At his 
desk, he laid down the paper and 
picked up the sheaf of manuscript, holding it in his hand, feeling the thickness and the weight 
of it, as if by its thickness and 
its weight he might reassure himself thaT what it held was good, 
that it was not labor wasted, that 
it said the many things he wished 
to say and said them well enough 
so that other men and women 
might read the words and know 
the naked thought that lay behind the coldness of the print. 

He should not waste the day, 
he told himself. He should stay 
here and work instead of traipsing 
off to meet this man his agent 
wanted him to meet. But Ann 
had been insistent and had said 
that it was important, and even 
when he had told her about the 
car being in the garage for repairs, she still had insisted that 



he come. That story about the 
car had been a fib, of course, for 
he knew even as he told her that 
Eb would have it ready for him 
to make the tripHe looked at his watch and saw 
he had no more than half an hour 
until Eb's garage would open and 
half an hour was not worth his 
while to spend in writing. 

HE picked up the paper and 
went out on the porch to 
read the morning's news. 

He thought about little Jane 
and what a sweet kid she was 
and how she'd praised his cooking and chattered on and on. 

"You aren't married," Jane had 
said. "Why aren't you married, 
Mr. Vickers?" 

And he had said, "Once there 
was a girl. I remember now. Once 
there was a girl." 

Her name had been Kathleen 
Preston and she had lived in a 
big brick house that sat up on a 
hill, a many-columned house with 
a wide porch and fanlights above 
the doors — an old house that had 
been built in the first flush of 
pioneer optimism, when the country had been new. The house had 
still stood when the land had failed and washed away in ditches 
and left the hillsides scarred with 
gullied yellow clay. 

He had been young then, so 
young that it hurt him now to 
think of it; so young he could not 



8 




 



understand that a girl who lived 
in an ancestral home with fanlights above the doors and a pillared portico could not seriously 
consider a boy whose father farmed a wornout farm where the 
corn grew slight and sickly. Or 
rather, perhaps, it had been her 
family that could not consider it, 
for she also must have been too 
young to fully understand. Perhaps she had quarreled with her 
family; perhaps there had been 
angry words and tears. That was 
something he had never known. 
For between that walk down the 
enchanted valley and the next 
time he had called, they had bundled her off to a school somewhere in the East and that was 
the last he had seen or heard 
of her. 

For remembrance sake, he had 
walked the valley again, alert to 
catch something that would spell 
out for him the enchantment of 
that day he had been with her. 
But the crab apples had dropped 
their blossoms and the lark did 
not sing so well and the enchantment had fled into some nevernever land. She had taken the 
magic with her. 

The paper fell out of his lap 
and he bent to pick it up. Opening it, he saw that the news was 
following the same drab pattern 
of all other days. 

The latest peace rumor still was 
going strong and the cold war 



still was boiling like dry ice on a 
hot fire. 

The cold war had been going 
on for years, of course, with crisis 
after crisis, rumor after rumor, 
near war always threatening and 
big war never breaking out, until 
a cold-war-weary world yawned 
in the face of the new peace rumors and the crises that were a 
dime a dozen. 

Someone at an obscure college 
down in Georgia had set a new 
record at raw egg-gulping and a 
glamorous movie star was on the 
verge of changing husbands once 
again and the steelworkers were 
threatening to strike. 

rFiHERE was a lengthy feature 
article about missing persons 
and he read about half of it, all 
that he wanted to. It seemed that 
people were constantly dropping 
out of sight, whole families at a 
time, and the police throughout 
the land were getting rather frantic. 

There always had been people 
who had disappeared, the article 
said, but they had been individuals. Now two or three families 
would disappear from the same 
community and two or three from 
another community and there was 
no trace of them at all. Usually 
they were from the poorer brackets. Where individuals had dropped from sight, there had been 
some reason for it, but in these 



SING AROUND THE SUN 



cases of mass disappearances 
there seemed to be no reason beyond poverty and why one would 
or could disappear because of 
poverty was something the article 
writer and the people he had interviewed could not figure out. 

There was a headline that read : 
More Worlds Than One, Says 
Savant. 

He read part of the story: 

BOSTON, MASS. <AP) — There 
may be another Earth just a second 
ahead of us and another world a 
second behind us and another world 
a second behind that one and another world a second behind ■ . . 
wet I, you get the idea. 

A tort of continuous chain of 
worlds, one behind the other. 

That is the theory of Dr. Vincent 
Aldridge. ... 

Vickers let the paper drop to 
the *floor and sat looking out 
across the garden. There was 
peace here, in this garden corner 
of the world, if there were nowhere else. A peace compounded 
of many things, of golden sunshine and the talk of summer 
leaves quivering in the wind, of 
bird and flower and sun dial, of 
picket fence that needed painting and an old pine tree dying 
quietly and tranquilly, taking its 
time to die, being friends with 
the grass and flowers and other 
trees all the while it died. 

Here there was no rumor and 
no threat; here was calm acceptance of the fact that time ran on, 
that winter came and summer, 



that Sun would follow Moon and 
that the life one held was a gift 
to be cherished rather than a 
right that one must wrest from 
other living things. 

Vickers glanced at his watch 
and saw that it was time to go. 

Ill 

EB, the garage man, hitched up 
his greasy britches and 
squinted his eyes against the 
smoke from the cigarette that 
hung from one corner of his 
grease-smeared mouth. 

"You see, it's this way, Jay," 
he explained. "I didn't fix your 
car." 

"I was going to the city," said 
Vickers, "but if my car's not 
fixed . . ." 

"You won't be needing that 
car any more. Guess that's really 
why I didn't fix it. Told myself 
it would be just a waste of 
money." 

"It's not that bad." protested 
Vickers. 

"Sure, it's got lots of miles in it. 
But you're going to be buying 
this new Forever car." 

"Forever car? That's a queer 
name for a car." 

"No, it isn't," Eb told him, 
stubbornly. "It'll really last forever. That's why they call it the 
Forever car, because it lasts forever. Fellow was in here yesterday 
and told me about it and asked 



10 




 



if I wanted to take it on and I 
said sure I would and this fellow, 
he said I was smart to take it on, 
because, he said, there isn't going 
to be any other car selling except 
this Forever car.'* 

"Now wait a minute," said 
Vickers. "They may call it a Forever car, but that doesn't mean 
it'll last forever. -No car would. 
Twenty years, maybe, or a lifetime, but not forever." 

"That's what this fellow told 
me. 'Buy one of them,' he says, 
'and use it all your life. When you 
die, will it to your son and when 
he dies, he can will it to his son, 
and so on down the line.' It's 
guaranteed to last forever. Anything goes wrong with it, they'll 
fix it up or give you a new one. 
All except the tires. They wear 
out, just like on any other car. 
And paint, too. But the paint is 
guaranteed ten years. If it goes 
bad sooner than ten years, you 
get a new job free." 

"I don't doubt a car could be 
made to last longer than the ones 
do now. But if they were built too 
well there'd be no replacement. 
It stands to reason a manufacturer in his right mind wouldn't 
build a car that would last forever. He'd put himself out of 
business. In the first place, it 
would cost too much . . ." 

"That's where you're wrong," 
Eb told him. "You get it complete for fifteen hundred." 



"Not much to look at, I suppose." 

"It's the classiest job you ever 
laid your eyes on. Fellow that was 
here was driving one of them and 
I looked it over good. Any color 
you want. Lots of chrome and 
stainless steel. All the latest gadgets. And drive? Man, that thing 
drives like a million dollars. But 
it might take some getting used 
to it. I want to open the hood 
to take a look at the motor and, 
you know, that hood doesn't 
open. 'What you doing there?' 
this fellow asked and I told him 
I wanted to look at the motor. 
'There isn't any need to,' this fellow says. 'Nothing ever goes 
wrong with it. You never need 
to get at it.' 'But,' I asked him, 
'where do you put in the oil?' 
And you know what he said? 
Well, sir, he said you don't put in 
no oil. 'All you put in is gasoline,' he tells me. 

"I'll have a dozen or so of them 
in within a day or so. Jay," said 
Eb. "You better let me save you 
one." 




"I'm short on money." 



"That's another thing about it. 
This company gives you good 
trade-in value. I figure I could 
give you a thousand for that 
wreck of yours." 

"It's not worth a thousand, 
Eb." 



RING AROUND THE SUN

"I know it's not. Fellow says, 
'Give them more than they're 
worth. Don't worry about what 
you give them. We'll make it 
right with you.' It doesn't exactly 
seem the smart way to do business, but if that's the way they 
want to operate, I won't say a 
word against it." 

"I'd have to think about it." 

"That would leave five hundred for you to pay. I can make 
it easy on you. Fellow said I 
should make it easy. Says they 
aren't so much interested in the 
money right now as getting a few 
of them Forever cars out, running 
on the road." 

"I don't like the sound of it," 
objected Vickers. "Here this company springs up overnight with no 
announcement at all with a 
brand-new car. You'd think there 
would have been something in 
the papers about it. If I were 
putting out a new car, I'd plaster 
the country with advertising . . . 
big ads in the newspapers, announcements on television, billboards every mile or so." 

■"Well, you know," said Eb, "I 
thought of that one, too. T said, 
'Look, you fellows want me to sell 
this car and how am I going to 
sell it when you aren't advertising it? How am I going to sell it 
when no one knows about it?' 
And he said that they figured the 
car was so good everyone would 
up and tell everybody else. Said 



there isn't any advertising that 
can beat word of mouth. Said 
they'd rather save the money for 
advertising to cut down the cost 
of the car." 

"I can't understand it." 

"It does sort of hit you that 
way," Eb admitted. "This gang 
that's putting out the Forever car 
isn't losing any money on it, you 
can bet your boots on that. Be 
crazy if they did. And if they 
aren't losing any money at it, 
can you imagine what the rest of 
them companies have been making all these years — two or three 
thousand for a pile of junk that 
falls apart second time you take 
it out?" 

"When you get the cars in," 
said VickerS, "I'll be down to 
take a look at them. We might 
make a deal." 

"Sure. You say you was going 
to the city?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"Be a bus along any minute 
now," said Eb. "Catch it down at 
the drugstore corner. Get you 
there in a couple of hours. Those 
fellows really wheel it." 

"I guess I could take a bus. I 
never thought of it." 

"I'm sorry about the car." said 
Eb. "If I'd known you was going 
to use it, I'd have fixed her up. 
Not much wrong with it. But I 
wanted to see what you thought 
about this other deal before I 
run you up a bill."

THE drugstore corner looked 
somehow unfamiliar and Vickers puzzled about it as he walked 
down the street toward it. Then, 
when he got closer, he saw what 
it was that was unfamiliar. 

Several weeks ago old Hans, 
the shoe repairman, had taken to 
his bed and died and the shoe repair shop, which had stood next 
to the drugstore for almost uncounted years, finally had been 
closed. 

Now it was open again — or, at 
least, the display window had 
been washed, something which 
old Hans in all his years had 
never bothered to do, and there 
was a display of some sort. 

And there was a sign. Vickers 
had been so intent in figuring out 
what was wrong with the finally 
washed window that he did not 
see the sign until he was almost 
even with the store. The sign was 
new and neatly lettered and it 
said GADGET SHOP. 

Vickers stopped before the window and looked at what was inside. A strip of black velvet had 
been laid along the display strip 
and displayed upon it were three 
items — a cigarette lighter, a razor 
blade and a single light bulb. 
Nothing else. 

Just those three items. There 
were no signs, no advertising, no 
prices. There was no need of any. 
Anyone who saw that window, 
Vickers knew, would recognize 



the items, although the store 
would not sell only those. There 
would be a couple of dozen others, each of them in its own way 
as distinguished and efficient as 
the three lying on the strip of 
velvet. 

There was a tapping sound 
along the walk and Vickers turned when it came close to him. It 
was his neighbor, Horton Flanders, out for his morning walk, 
with his slightly shabby, carefully 
brushed clothes and his smart 
malacca cane. No one else, Vickers told himself, would have the 
temerity to carry a . cane along 
the streets of Cliffwood. 

Mr. Flanders saluted him with 
the cane and moved in to stand 
beside him and stare at the window. 

"So they're branching out," he 
said. 

"Apparently," Vickers agreed. 

"Peculiar outfit," said Mr. 
Flanders. "You may know, although I presume you don't, that 
I have been most interested in 
this company. Just a matter of 
curiosity, you understand. I am 
curious, I might add, about many 
different things." 

"I hadn't noticed." 

"Oh, my, yes. About many 
things. About the carbohydrates, 
for instance. Most intriguing setup, don't you think so, Mr. Vickers?" 

"I hadn't given it much 



RING AROUND THE SUN

thought. I have been so busy that 
I'm afraid — '* 

"There's something going on," 
said Mr. Flanders. "The question 
is what and why." 

The bus came down the street, 
passed them and braked to a stop 
at the drugstore corner. 

"I'm afraid I'll have to leave 
you," Vickers said- "I'm going to 
the city. If I'm back tonight, why 
don't you drop over?" 

"Oh, I will," Mr. Flanders told 
him. "I nearly always do." 

IV 

IT had been the blade at first, 
the razor blade that would not 
wear out. And after that the 
lighter that never failed to light, 
that required no flints and never 
needed filling. -Then the light bulb 
that would burn forever if it met 
no accident. Now it was the Forever car and the synthetic carbohydrates. 

"There is something going on," 
Mr. Flanders had said to him, 
standing there in front of old 
Hans' shop. "The question is 
what and why." 

Vickers sat in his seat next to 
the window, well back in the bus. 

There was a tie-up somewhere, 
a common denominator to explain why it should be these five 
items and not five other things, 
say roller curtains and pogo sticks 
and yoyos and airplanes and 



toothpaste. Razor blades shaved 
a man and light bulbs lit his way 
and a cigarette lighter would light 
a cigarette and the synthetic carbohydrates had ironed out at 
least one international crisis and 
saved some millions of people 
from starvation or, war. 

"There is something going on," 
Flanders had said, standing there 
in neat, shabby clothes and with 
that ridiculous stick clutched in 
his fist, although, come to think 
of it, it was not ridiculous when 
Mr. Flanders held it. 

The Forever car used no oil 
and when you died you willed it 
to your son, and when he died 
he willed it to his son, and if your 
great-great-grandfather bought 
one of the cars and you were the 
eldest son of the eldest son of the 
eldest son, you would have it, too. 
For the car would last forever. 

But it would do more than that. 
It would close every automotive 
plant in the matter of a year or 
so. It would shut down most 
of the garages and repair shops. 
It would be a blow to the steel 
industry and the glass industry 
and the fabric makers and many 
other industries. 

The razor blade hadn't seemed 
important, nor the light bulb, 
nor the lighter, but now they suddenly were. Thousands of men 
would lose their jobs and they 
would come home and face the 
family and say: "Well ."this is it. 



14 




 



After all these years I haven't 
got a job." 

The family would go about 
their everyday affairs in tight and 
terrible silence, with a queer air 
of dread hanging over them, and 
the man would buy newspapers, 
all the newspapers that there 
were, and would study the want 
ad columns, then go out and walk 
the streets and men in little cages 
or at desks in outer offices would 
shake their heads at him. 

TjMNALLY the man would go to 
one of those little places that 
had the sign "Carbohydrates, 
Inc." over its door and he would 
shuffle in embarrassment, the 
humiliation of a good workman 
who cannot find a job, and he 
would say, "I'm a little down on 
my luck and the cash is running 
low. I wonder — " 

The man behind the desk 
would say, "Why, sure, how many 
in your family?" The man would 
tell him and the one who was at 
the desk would write on a slip 
of paper and hand it to him. 
"That window over there," he'd 
say. "I figure that's enough to last 
you for a week, but if it isn't, be 
sure to come back any time you 
want to." 

The man would take the slip 
of paper and try to say his thanks, 
but the carbohydrates man would 
brush them easily aside and say, 
"That's what we're here for — 



helping guys like you." 

The man would go to the window and the man behind the 
window would look at the slip of 
paper and hand him packages 
and one package would be synthetic stuff that tasted like potatoes and another one would 
taste like bread and there would 
be others that would make you 
think you were eating corn or 
peas. 

It wasn't like relief — anyhow, 
you could say it wasn't. These 
carbohydrates people didn't insult 
you when you came to ask for 
help. They treated you like a paying customer and they always 
said that you should come back 
and sometimes when you didn't 
they came around to see what 
had happened — if maybe you had 
got a job or were bashful about 
coming in again. If it turned out 
that you were bashful, they'd sit 
down and talk and before they 
left they had you thinking you 
were doing them a favor by taking the carbohydrates off their 
hands. 

Because of the carbohydrates, 
millions who would have died 
were still alive in India and in 
China. Because of carbohydrates, 
almost every relief office throughout the entire world had been 
forced to close its doors. People 
wouldn't go to a relief office to 
be bullied and humiliated when 
they could go across the street 



RING AROUND THE SUN

and get food from folks who 
seemed downright glad to t see 
them. 

Now the thousands who would 
lose their jobs would travel the 
same trail to the door with the 
carbohydrates sign. 

The automotive industry would 
have to shut down. Why buy arty 
other car when you could walk 
down the street and get one that 
would last forever? Just as the 
razor blade industry had closed 
its doors when it was possible 
to buy an everlasting blade at the 
gadget shops. The same thing 
had happened with light bulbs 
and with cigarette lighters and 
the chances were, Vickers told 
himself, that the Forever car 
wasn't the last that would be 
heard from these manufacturers, 
whoever they might be. 

Those who made the razor 
blades also must have made the 
lighters and the light bulbs,, and 
those who made the gadget items 
must have designed the Forever 
car. Not the same companies, perhaps, although he couldn't know, 
for it had never occurred to him 
before to try to find out. 

T^HE bus was filling up, but 
Vickers still sat by himself, 
staring out the window and sorting out his thoughts. 

A couple of women behind him 
were talking and, without consciously trying to eavesdrop, he 



heard what they were saying. 

One of them giggled and said, 
"We have the most interesting 
group. So many interesting people in it." 

And the other woman said, "I 
been thinking about joining one 
of those groups, but Charlie says ' 
it's all baloney. Says we're living 
in America in the year 1977 and 
there's no reason in the world 
why we should pretend we aren't. 
Says this is the best country and 
the best time the world has ever 
known. Says we got all the modern conveniences and everything. 
Says we're happier than people 
ever been before. Says this pretending business is just a lot of 
communist propaganda and he'd 
like to get hold of the ones that 
got it started. Says . . ." 

"Oh, I don't know," interrupted the first woman. "It is kind of 
fun. It takes a lot of work, of 
course, reading about them old 
times and all of that, but one 
fellow was saying at a meeting 
the other night you get out of it 
what you put into it and I guess 
he's right. But I don't seem to 
be able to put much into it. I 
must be the flighty type. I'm not 
too good a reader and I don't 
understand too well and I got to 
have a lot explained to me, but 
there are them who get a lot out 
of it, seems like. There's a man 
in our group that is living back 
in London, back in the times of 



16 




 



a man named Peeps. I don't know 
who this Peeps was, but I guess 
he was an important man or 
something. You don't know who 
Peeps was, do you, Gladys?" 

"Not me," said Gladys, 

"Well, anyhow, this fellow talks 
all the time about this Peeps. 
He wrote a book, this Peeps, and 
it must be an awful long book 
because he tells about so many 
things. This man I was telling 
you about writes the most wonderful diary. We always like to 
have him read it to us. You know, 
it sounds almost as if he was 
really living there." 

The bus stopped for a railroad 
crossing and Vickers glanced at 
his watch.* They'd be in the city 
in another half an hour. 

It was a waste of time, he told 
himself. No matter what sort of 
scheme Ann had up her sleeve, it 
would be a waste of time, for he 
was not going to allow anything 
to interrupt his writing. He 
shouldn't have allowed himself 
to be talked into wasting even 
this one day. 

Back of him, Gladys was saying, "Did you hear about these 
new houses they are putting out? 
I was talking to Charlie about 
them the other night and I was 
saying maybe we ought to look 
into them. Our place is getting 
kind of shabby, you know, and we 
will have to paint it and sort of fix 
it up, but Charlie said no one 



would put out them kind of 
houses on the sort of deal they 
offer without there was a catch 
somewhere. Mabel, have you seen 
any of them houses or read anything about them?" 

"I was telling you," Mabel said, 
"about this group I belong to. 
One of the fellows is pretending 
that he's living in the future. 
Now, I ask you, ain't that a 
laugh? Imagine anyone pretending he's living in the future . . ," 

V 

OUTSIDE the door, Ann Carter stopped and said, "Please 
remember Jay, his name is Crawford. You're not to call him Cranford or Crawham or any other 
name but Crawford." 

Vickers said humbly, "I'll do 
my very best." 

She came close to him and 
tightened his tie and straightened 
it and nicked some imaginary 
dust off his lapel. 

"We're going out as soon as 
this is over and buy you a suit," 
she said. 

"I have a suit." 

"Why don't you wear it, then?" 

"Why, I am," said Vickers. 

The letters on the door said 
"North American Research." 

"What I can't understand," 
protested Vickers, "is why North 
American Research and I should 
have anything in common."

"Money," said Ann. "They 
have it and you need it." 

She opened the door and he 
followed her in obediently, thinking what a pretty woman she was 
and how efficient. Too efficient. 
She knew books and publishers 
and what the public wanted and 
she was onto all the angles. She 
drove herself and everyone 
around her. She was never so 
happy as when three telephones 
were ringing and there were five 
dozen letters to be answered and 
a dozen calls to make. She had 
bullied him into coming here and 
it was not beyond reason, he told 
himself, that she had bullied 
Crawford and North American 
Research into wanting him to 
come. 

"Miss Carter," said the girl at 
the de^k, "you can go right in. 
Mr. Crawford is waiting for you." 

She's even got the Indian sign 
on the receptionist, Vickers 
thought. 

VI 

p EORGE CRAWFORD was a 

big man who overflowed the 
chair in which he sat. He held 
his hands folded over his paunch 
and talked with no change of 
tone, with no inflection whatsoever, and was the stillest man 
Vickers had ever seen. He sat 
huge and stolid and his lips 
scarcely moved and his voice was 



not much louder than a whisper. 

"I have read some of your 
work, Mr. Vickers," he said. "I 
am impressed by it." 

"I am glad to hear you say so," 
Vickers said. 

"Three years ago, I never 
would have thought that I would 
ever read a piece of fiction or be 
talking to its author. Now, however, I find that we need a man 
like you. I have talked it over 
with my directors and we are 
all agreed that you are the man 
who could do the job for -us." 

He paused and stared at Vickers with bright blue eyes that 
peered out like bullet points from 
the folds of flesh. 

"Miss Carter," he %aid, "tells 
me that, at the moment, you are 
very busy." 

"That is right," said Vickers. 

"Some important piece of work, 
I presume." 

"I hope it is." 

"This thing I have in mind 
would be much more important." 

"That," Vickers told him crisply, "is a matter of opinion." 

"Before we go any further, I 
would like it understood that 
what I have to say is of a confidential nature." 

"Mr. Crawford, I have little 
stomach for cloak and dagger 
business." 

"This is not cloak and dagger 
business," said Crawford and for 
the first time there was emotion 




 



in his low, quiet voice. "It is the 
business of a world with its back 
against the wall. You have heard 
of the Forever car?" 

VICKERS nodded. "The garage 
owner in my home town tried 
to sell me one this morning." 

"And the everlasting razor 
blades and the lighter and the 
light bulbs?" 

"I have one of the blades." said 
Vickers, "a*d it is the best I 
ever owned. I doubt that it is 
everlasting, but it is a good blade 
and I've never had to sharpen it. 
When it wears out, I intend to 
buy another one." 

"Unless you lose it, you will 
never have to. Because, Mr. 
Vickers, it is an everlasting blade. 
And the car is an everlasting car. 
Maybe you've heard about the 
houses, too." 

"Not enough to matter." 
"The houses are prefabricated 
units," said Crawford, "and they 
sell at the flat rate of five hundred 
dollars a room — set up. You can 
trade in your old home on them 
at a fantastic trade-in value and 
the credit terms are liberal — 
much more liberal, I might add, 
than any sane financing institution would ever allow. They are 
heated and air-conditioned by a 
solar plant that tops anything — 
you hear me, anything — that we 
have today. There are many other features, but that gives you 



something of a rough idea." 

"They sound good. We've been 
talking about low-cost housing 
for a long time now. Maybe 
this is it." 

"They are a good idea," admitted Crawford. "I would be 
the last to deny they are. Except 
that they will ruin the power 
people. The solar plant supplies 
it all — heat, light, power. They 
will put thousands of carpenters 
and masons and painters out of 
work and on the carbohydrates 
lines. They eventually will wreck 
the lumber industry." 

"I can understand about the 
power angle, but that business 
about the carpenters and the lumber industry doesn't quite make 
sense. Surely these houses use 
lumber and it must take carpenters to build them." 

"They use lumber, all right, 
and someone builds them, but we 
don't know who it is." 

"You could check," suggested 
Vickers. "There must be a corporate setup. There must be mills 
and factories somewhere." 

? fTHHERE'S a company," said ■ 

Crawford. "A sales company. We started with that and 
we found the warehouse from 
which the houses are shipped 
after they are sold. But that's the 
end of it. There is, so far as we 
can find, no factory that builds 
them. They are consigned from a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



certain company and we have its 
name and address. But no one has 
ever sold a stick of timber to 
that company. They have never 
bought a hinge. They hire no 
men. They list factory sites and 
the sites are there, but there aren't 
any factories. And, to the best of 
our knowledge, no single person 
has gone into or come out of the 
home office address since we've 
been watching it." 

"That's fantastic," Vickers objected. 

"Of course it is," agreed Crawford. "Lumber and other materials go into those houses and 
somewhere there must be men 
who build them." 

"Mr. Crawford, why are you 
interested?" 

"Well, now, I wasn't quite 
readj^to tell you that." 

"I know you weren't," said 
Vickers, "but you'll tell me anyway." 

"I had hoped to sketch in a bit 
more of the background so you 
would understand what I am 
driving at. Our interest — I might 
say our organization — sounds just 
a little silly until you know the 
background." 

"Someone has you scared. You 
wouldn't admit it, of course, but 
you're scared livid." 

"Queerly enough, I will admit 
it. But it's not me, Mr. Vickers — 
if s industry, the industry of the 
entire world." 



"You think the people who are 
making and selling these houses," 
asked Vickers, "are the same ones 
who are making the Forever car 
and the lighters and the bulbs?" 

Crawford nodded. "And the 
carbohydrates, too." 

"Of course." 

"It's terrifying," Crawford said, 
"when you think about it. Here 
we have someone who wrecks industries and throws millions out 
of work, then turns around and 
offers those same millions the 
food to live on." 

"A political plot?" 

"We are convinced that it is a 
planned attack on world economy 
— a deliberate .effort to undermine the social and economic system of our way of life, and after 
that, of course, the political system. Our way of life is based on 
capital, be it private capital or 
state control of resources and on 
the wage that the worker earns 
at his daily job. Take away those 
two things, capital and jobs, and 
you have undercut the whole 
basis of an orderly society." 

"We?" asked Vickers. "Who 
are we?" 

"North American Research." 

"And North American Research?" 

"You're getting interested," 
said Crawford. 

"I want to know who I'm talking to and what you want of me 
and what it's all about."

/CRAWFORD sat for a long 
^time without speaking, and 
then he finally said, "That is what 
I meant when I told you what 
I had to say was highly confidential." 

"I will swear no oath." said 
Vickers, "if that is what you 
mean." 

"Let's go back and review some 
history. Who we are and what we 
are will become apparent then. 

"You remember the razor 
blade. It was the first to come out. 
An everlasting razor blade. The 
news spread quickly and everyone went out and bought one. 
Now the ordinary man will get 
anywhere from one to half a 
dozen shaves out of a blade. 
Then he throws it away and puts 
in another. That means he is a 
continuous buyer of razor blades. 
As a result, the razor blade industry employed thousands of 
workers, it represented a certain 
profit for thousands of dealers, 
it was a buyer of steel. In other 
words, it was an economic factor 
which, linked with thousands of 
others, make up the picture of 
world industry. So what happens?" 

"I can tell you that," said Vickers, "although I'm no economist. 
No one bought any more razor 
blades. The razor blade industry 
was out the window." 

"Then there was the lighter. A 
small thing in itself, of course, 



but fairly large when you look 
at it from the world point of 
view. The same thing happened 
there. And the everlasting light 
bulbs. Three industries gone. Mr. 
Vickers. Three industries wiped 
out. You said a while ago that I 
was scared and I told you that I 
was. It was after the bulbs that 
we got scared. Because if someone could wipe out three industries, why not half a dozen, a 
dozen, a hundred — why not all 
of them? 

"We organized, and by we I 
mean the industry of the world — 
not American industry alone, but 
the industry of America and the 
British commonwealth and the 
continent of Europe and Russia 
and all of the rest of them. There 
were a few, of course, who were 
skeptical. There still are a few 
who never have come in, but by 
and large I can tell you that our 
organization represents and is 
backed by every major industry 
of the entire world. I would prefer you not to mention this." 

"At the moment," Vickers told 
him, "I have no intention of saying anything about it." 

"We organized," said Crawford, 
"and we swung a lot of power, as 
you can well imagine. We made 
certain representations and we 
brought certain pressures and we 
got a few things done. For one 
thing, no newspaper, no periodical, no radio station now will ac

cept advertising for any of the 
gadgets or give them any mention 
in the news. For another, no 
reputable drugstore or any other 
place of business will sell a razor 
blade or a bulb or lighter." 

"That was when they set up the 
gadget shops?" 

"Exactly," said Crawford. 

"They're branching out," said 
Vickers. "One opened in Cliff wood just the other day." 

WT*HEY set up the gadget 

-■- shops," said Crawford, "and 
they developed a new form of advertising. They hired thousands 
of men and women who went 
around from place to place and 
said to people they would meet, 
'Did you hear about those wonderfu^new gadgets they are getting out? You haven't? Well, just 
let me tell you . . .' That is the 
best kind of advertising there is. 
But it's more expensive than you 
can possibly imagine. 

"So we knew that we were up 
against not merely inventive and 
productive genius, but almost unlimited money as well. 

"And we investigated. We tried 
to find out who they were and 
how they operated and what they 
meant to do. As I've told you, 
we ran into stone walls." 

"There might be legal angles," 
said Vickers. 

"We have run down the legal 
angles. These people, whoever 



they may be, are covered from 
hell to breakfast. Taxes? So there 
won't be any investigation, they 
actually pay more taxes than they 
need to pay. Rules of corporation? They are more than meticulous in meeting all the rules. Social security? They pay it on 
huge payrolls that we are convinced are utterly fictitious, but 
you can't go to the social security 
people and say, 'Look, there 
aren't any such people as these 
they're paying for.' There are 
other points, but those serve as 
illustrations. We've run down so 
many legal blind alleys that our 
legal force is dizzy." 

"Mr. Crawford," said Vickers, 
"you make out a most interesting 
case, but I can't see the point of 
what you said earlier. You said 
this was a conspiracy to break 
world industry. If you study your 
economic history, you will find 
example on example of cutthroat 
competition. That's all this is." 

"You forget," Crawford replied, 
"about the carbohydrates." 

A ND that was true, thought 
Vickers. The carbohydrates 
had no place in mere cutthroat 
competition. 

"We checked into them," Crawford said. "So far as we're concerned, the carbohydrates aren't 
being manufactured — they simply 
exist. They are shipped to the distribution offices from several 




 



warehouses and none of the warehouses are big enough to carry 
more than a day or two's supply. 
We can find no factories and we 
can't trace transportation — oh, 
sure, from the warehouses to thedistribution points, but not from 
anywhere to the warehouses. It's 
like the old story that Hawthorne told about the pitcher of 
milk that never ran dry." 

"What happens when the men 
who are out of work need more 
than just a gift of food?" asked 
Vickers. "What happens when 
their families are in tatters and 
they need clothes and they're 
thrown out into the street?" 

"I think I can answer that. 
Some other philanthropic society 
will spring up overnight and will 
furnish clothes and shelter. 
They're selling houses now for 
five hundred a room, which is no 
more than token payment. Why 
not give them away? Why not 
clothing that will cost no more 
than a tenth or a twentieth of 
what you pay today. A suit for 
five dollars, say, or a dress for 
fifty cents." 

"You have no idea of what is 
coming next?" 

"We've tried to dope it out," 
said Crawford. "We figured the 
car would come quickly, and it 
did. We figured houses, too, and 
they have put them out. Clothing 
should be one of the next items 
to go on the market." 



"Food, shelter, transportation, 
clothing," said Vickers. "Those 
are four basics." 

"They also have fuel and power," Crawford added. 

"But who is it? You've told me 
you don't know, but you must 
have some idea, some educated 
guess." 

"Not an inkling. We have tables 
of organization for their corporation setups. We can't find the 
men themselves; they are names 
we've never heard of." 

"Russia?" 

Crawford shook his head. "Russia is cooperating. That should 
prove how scared they are." 

For the first time, Crawford 
moved. He unfolded his hands 
from across his paunch, grasped 
the arms of his massive chair and 
pulled himself straight, sitting 
upright now. 

"I suppose," he said, "that you 
are wondering where you fit in 
on this." 

"Naturally." 

"We can't say, 'here we are, a 
combine of the world's industrial 
might, fighting to protect your 
way of life.' We can't explain 
to the people what the situation 
is. They'd laugh at us. After all, 
you can't tell them that a car 
that will last forever or a house 
that costs only five hundred a 
room is a bad thing for them. We 
can't tell them anything and yet 
this needs telling. We want you

to write a book about it." 

"I don't see . . ." said Vickers, 
but Crawford stopped him in 
mid -sentence. 

"You would write it as if you 
had doped it out yourself. You 
would hint at informed sources 
that were too high to name. We'd 
furnish all the data, but the material would appear as yours." 

Vickers came slowly to his 
feet. He reached out a hand and 
picked up his hat. 

"Thanks for the chance," he 
said. "I'm not having any." 

VII 

INN CARTER said to Vickers: "Someday I'm going to 
get sore enough at you to take 
you apart. And when I do maybe 
I'll have a chance to find what 
makes you tick." 

"I have a book to write," said 
Vickers. "I'm writing it. What

SCIENCE FICTION 



more do you want?" 

"That book could keep. You 
could write it anytime." 

"Go ahead, tell me I threw 
away a million bucks. That's 
what you're thinking." 

"You could have charged them 
a fancy fee for writing and gotten 
a contract with the publisher like 
there never was before . . ." 



"And pushed aside the greatest piece of work I've ever done," 
said Vickers, "and come back to 
it cold and find I'd lost the feel." 

"Every book you write is your 
greatest one. You're nothing but 
a literary ham. Sure, you do good 
work and your darn books sell, 
although sometimes I wonder 
why, but if there were no money 




RING AROUND THE SUN 



25 



in it, you'd never write another 
word. Tell me, honest, why do 
you write?" 

"You've answered it for me. 
You say it is for money. All 
right, so it is for money." 

"All right, so I have a sordid 
soul." 

"My God, we're fighting as if 
we're married!" 

"That's another thing. You've 
never married, Jay. It's an index 
of your selfishness. I bet you 
never even thought of it." 

"Once I did," said Vickers. 
"Once long ago." 

"Here, put your head down 
here and have a good long cry. 
I bet it was pitiful. I bet that's 
how you get some of those excruciating love scenes you put into y«ur books." 

"Ann, you're getting maudlin 
drunk." 

"If I'm getting drunk, you're 
the man who drove me to it. 
Thanks for the chance, but I'm 
not having any." 

"I had a hunch there was something phony there," insisted Vickers. 

"That was you," Ann retorted. 

She finished off her drink. 

"Don't use a hunch," she said, 
"to duck the responsibility of 
turning down the best thing you 
ever had. Anytime someone dangles money like that in front of 
me, I'm not letting any hunch 
stand in my way." 



"I'm sure you wouldn't," Vickers agreed. 

"That was a nasty thing to 
say," Ann told him. "Pay for the 
drinks and let's get out of here. 
I'm putting you on that bus and 
don't you come back here again." 

VIII 

THE huge sign was draped diagonally across the front of 
the huge show window. It read: 

HOUSES 
TAILORED TO ORDER 
$500 a room 
LIBERAL TRADE-IN 
ON YOUR OLD HOME 

In the window was a five or 
six room house, set in the middle 
of a small, beautifully planned 
lawn and garden. There was a 
sun dial in the garden and a cupola with a flying duck weather 
vane on the attached garage. Two 
white lawn chairs and a white 
round table stood on the clipped 
grass and there was a new and 
shiny car standing in the driveway. 

Ann squeezed Vickers' arm. 
"Let's go in." 

"This must be what Crawford 
was talking about," said Vickers. 

"You got lots of time to catch 
the bus and we could have a 
look." 

"We might as well. If you get 




 



interested in looking at a house, 
you won't be chewing me." 

"If I thought it were possible. 
I'd trap and marry you." 

"And make my life a hell." 

"Why, certainly." Ann told him 
sweetly. "Why else would I do 
it?" 

The door swung to behind them 
and the noise of the street was 
shut away and they walked on 
the deep green carpeting that 
doubled as a lawn. 

A salesman saw them and came 
over. 

"We were just passing by," said 
Ann, "and we thought we would 
drop in. It looks like a fine house 
and . . ." 

"It is a fine house," the salesman assured them, "and it has 
many special features." 

"Is that true what the sign 
said?" asked Viekers. "Five hundred dollars a room?" 

"Everyone asks me that. They 
read the sign, but they don't believe it, so the first thing they 
ask me when they come in is 
whether it is really true that we 
sell these houses for five hundred 
a room." 

"Well, is it?" persisted Viekers. 

"Absolutely," said the salesman. "A five room house is 
twenty-five hundred dollars and a 
ten room house would be five 
thousand dollars. Most people, 
of course, aren't interested in a 
ten room house at first." 



"What do you mean, at first?" 

"Well, this is what you might 
call a house that grows. You buy 
a five room house, say, and in a 
little while you figure that you 
want another room, so we come 
out and redesign the house and 
make it a six room house." 

"Isn't that expensive?" Ann 
asked. 

"Oh, not at all," the salesman 
said. "It only costs you five hundred dollars for the extra room. 
That is a flat and standard 
charge." 

"This is a prefabricated house, 
isn't it?" asked Ann. 

"I suppose you could call it 
that, although it does the house 
injustice. When you say 'prefabricated' you are thinking of a 
house that is pre-cut and sort of 
stuck together. Takes a week or 
ten days to put it togethei and 
then you just have a shell — no 
heating plant, no fireplace, nothing." 

"I'm interested in this extra 
room angle," said Viekers. "You 
say that when they want an extra room, they just call you up 
and you come out and stick one 
on." 

HPHE salesman stiffened slightly. 

"We stick nothing on. At all 
times, your house is well planned 
and practical, designed in accordance with the highest scientific 
and esthetic concepts of what a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



77 



home should be. In some cases, 
adding another room means that 
we have to change the whole 
house around, rearrange the 
rooms and such. If you wanted to 
change the place completely, the 
best thing might be to trade the 
house in on a new one. For doing 
that, we make a service charge 
of one per cent per year of the 
original cost, plus, of course, the 
charge for the extra rooms." 

He looked at the two of them 
hopefully. "You have a house, 
perhaps?" 

"A little cottage up the valley," 
said Vickers. "It's not much of 
a place." 

"Worth how much, would you 
say?" 

"Fifteen or twenty thousand, 
but 1^ doubt if I could get that 
much." 

"We'd give you twenty thousand," said the salesman, "subject to appraisal. Our appraisals 
are most liberal." 

"Look," Vickers objected, "I'd 
only want a five or six room 
house. That would come to 
twenty five hundred or three 
thousand." 

"We'd pay the difference in 
cash." 

"It doesn't make sense!" 

"We're willing to pay the going 
market value on existing homes 
in order to introduce our own. In 
your case, we'd pay you the difference, then take your old place 



and move it away and set up the 
new one. It's as simple as that." 

Ann said to Vickers, "Go ahead 
and tell the man that you aren't 
having any. This sounds like a 
good sound business proposition 
to me, so you'll naturally turn it 
down." 

"Madam," said the salesman, 
"I don't quite understand." 

"It's just a private joke," Vickers interpreted. 

"Oh . . . Well, I was telling you 
that this house has some special 
features." 

"Go ahead, please," said Ann. 
"Tell us about them." 

"Very happy to. For instance, 
there is the solar plant. You do 
know what a solar plant is?" 

Vickers nodded. "A power plant 
operated by the Sun." 

"Exactly," said the salesman. 
"This plant, however, is somewhat more efficient than the usual 
solar plant. It not only heats the 
house in winter, but supplies electrical power for the year round. 
It eliminates the necessity of relying upon a public utility for your 
power. I might add there is much 
more than you will ever need." 

"A nice feature," said Ann. 

"Then," continued the salesman, "it comes fully equipped. 
You get a refrigerator and a deep 
freeze, an automatic washer and 
drier, a dish washer, a garbage 
disposal unit, a toaster, a waffle 
iron, radio, television, and other

odds and ends." 

"An extra charge for them, of 
course," said Vickers. 

"Positively not. All you pay is 
five hundred a room." 

"And beds?" asked Ann. 
"Chairs and stuff like that?" 

"I'm sorry," said the salesman. 
"You have to furnish those yourself." 

"There is an extra charge," 
Vickers pushed on, "for carting 
away the old house and putting 
up the new one." 

|~\RAWING himself erect, the 
salesman spoke with quiet 
dignity. "There are no hidden 
costs. You buy the house and pay 
—or arrange to pay — at the rate 
of five hundred a room. We have 
trained crews of workmen who 
move away your old house and 
erect the new one. All of that is 
included in the original cost. 
Some buyers want to change location. In that case we are usually 
able to work out an acceptable 
exchange plan between their old 
real estate and the new location 
they select. You, I presume, 
would want to stay where you 
are. You said you were up the 
valley. A most attractive place." 

"Well, I don't know," said 
Vickers. 

"I forgot to mention one thing," 
the salesman went on. "You never 
have to paint this house. It is 
built of material that is of the 



same color all the way through 
and never wears off or fades. We 
have a wide range of very attractive color combinations." 

"We don't want to take up too 
much of your time," said Vickers. 
"You see, we're not really customers. We just dropped in." 

"But you have a house?" 

"Yes, I have a house." 

"And we stand ready to replace 
it with a new one and pay you a 
comfortable sum besides." 

"I know all that," said Vickers, 
"but . . 

"It seems to me," the salesman 
said, "that you should be trying 
to sell me instead of me trying 
to sell you." 

"I have a house and I like it. 
How would I know I'd like one 
of these new houses?" 

"Why, sir, I've just been telling 
you — " 

"I'm used to my house. I'm acquainted with it and it's got used 
to me. I've become attached to 
it—" 

"Jay Vickers," said Ann, "y° u 
can't become attached to a house 
in only three years. To hear you 
talk about it, one would think 
you'd lived all your life in an old 
ancestral home." 

"I have the feel of it," Vickers 
stated obstinately. "I know the 
place. There is a creaky board 
in the dining room and I step on 
it on purpose at times just to 
hear it creak. And there's a pair 



RING AROUND THE 5UN 



29 



of robins that have a nest in the 
vine on the porch and there's a 
cricket in the basement. I've 
hunted for that cricket, but I 
never could find him; he was too 
smart for me. And now I wouldn't 
touch him if I could, because he 
is a part of the house and — " 

"You'd never be bothered with 
crickets in one of our houses. 
They have bug repellant built 
right into them. You never are 
bothered with mosquitoes or ants 
or crickets or anything of the 
sort." 

BUT I'm not bothered with 
this cricket," said Vickers. 
"That is what I was trying to 
tell you. I like it. I'm not sure I'd 
like a house where .a cricket 
couldn't live. Now, mice, that's 
a littl* different." 

"I dare say," declared the salesman, "that you would riot have 
mice in one of our houses." 

"I won't have any in mine, 
either. I called the exterminator 
and they'll be gone by the time 
I get home." 

"Well, now," the salesman said, 
"there is something else to consider in connection with our 
house. We put them up in one 
day's time. You give us an order 
tonight and by tomorrow night 
you can move in. And if, for some 
reason or other, you move to another city or another part of the 
country, we will undertake to 



move your house for you. With 
our houses there is no need to go 
through the ordeal of selling the 
old house, moving to your new 
location and then spending weeks, 
if not months, hunting for the 
kind of house you want to buy. 
You move your house right along 
with you, like your briefcase or 
your golf clubs. 

"Let's say you aren't moving 
to another city. Maybe you just 
get dissatisfied with the location 
that you have. You want to move 
out to the country or to another 
section of the city. Pick out the 
place you want to go and let us 
know. Give us twenty-four hours 
and we'll move the house for 
you." 

"I suppose," said Ann, "it costs 
a lot to have the house moved." 

"Not at all," the salesman answered. "One per cent of the purchase price, that's all. In the case 
of a five room house, that would 
be twenty -five dollars." 

"But suppose it was clear 
across the country . . ." 

"It makes no difference," said 
the salesman. "We make money 
on some, lose on others. In the 
end, we even out." 

"One thing is bothering me," 
said Ann. "You remember all 
that equipment you mentioned, 
the washer and refrigerator and 
television and . . . ?" 

"Yes, certainly." 

"But you didn't even once 



30 




 



happen to mention a stove." 

"Didn't I ?" asked the salesman. "Now how could I have let 
it slip my mind? Of course you 
get a stove." 

IX 

WHEN the bus reached Cliffwood, darkness was beginning to fall. Vickers bought a 
paper at the corner drugstore and 
made his way across the street to 
the town's one clean cafe. 

He had ordered the meal and 
was just starting on the paper 
when a piping voice hailed him. 
"Hi there, Mr. Vickers." 
Vickers put down the paper 
and looked up. It was Jane, the 
moppet who had come for breakfast. 

"Why, hello, Jane," he said. 
"What are you doing here?'* 

"Me and Mommy came down 
to buy some ice cream for supper," Jane explained. She perched 
herself on the edge of the chair 
across the table from him. 
"Where you been today, Mr. 
Vickers? I came across to see you, 
but there was a man there and 
he wouldn't let me in. He said he 
was killing mice. What Was he 
killing mice for, Mr. Vickers?" 

"Jane," a voice said. 

Vickers looked up and a woman stood there, sleek and maturely beautiful, and she smiled at 
him. 



"You must not mind her. Mr. 
Vickers," she said. 

"I don't. I think she's wonderful." 

"I'm Mrs. Leslie," said the 
woman. "Jane's mother. We've 
been neighbors for a long time 
now, but we've never met." 

She sat down at the table. 

"I've read some of your books," 
she said, "and they are splendid. 
I haven't read them all. One has 
so little time." 

"Thank you, Mrs. Leslie," said 
Vickers, and wondered if she 
would think that he was thanking 
her for not reading all his books. 

"I had meant to come over and 
see you. Some of us are organizing a Pretentionist club and I 
have you on my list." 

Vickers shook his head. "I am 
always pressed for time. I make 
it a rule to belong to no organization." 

"But this," said Mrs. Leslie, 
"would be — well, you might say 
this would be down your alley." 

"I am glad you thought of me." 

She laughed at him. "You 
think us foolish, Mr. Vickers." 

"No," he said, "not foolish." 

"Infantile, then." 

"Since you supplied the word," 
said Vickers, "I must admit it 
doeg seem somewhat infantile." 

NOW, he thought, I've done it. 
She will twist it around so 
that it will appear it was I, not 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



she. who said it. She'll tell all the 
neighbors how I told her to her 
face the club was infantile. 

But she didn't seem insulted. 
"It must seem that way to someone like you who has every minute filled. But I think it might be 
a wonderful way to work up an 
interest — an outside interest, that 
is." 

"I have no doubt of it," said 
Vickers. 

"It's a lot of work, I understand. You decide on the period 
you'd like to pretend you are living in. Then you must read up 
on the period and write your 
diary and it must be a full account of each day's activities and 
not just a sentence or two. You 
must make it interesting and, if 
you can, exciting." 

^There are many periods of 
history that could be made exciting." 

"I'm glad to hear you say 
that," Mrs. Leslie replied eagerly. 
"Would you tell me one? If you 
were going to choose a period for 
excitement, which would you 
choose?" 

"I'm sorry," Vickers said. "I'd 
have to think about it." 

"But I just heard you say there 
were many . . ." 

"I know. And yet, when I think 
of it, the present day might prove 
as exciting as any of the others." 

"But there's nothing going on!" 

"There's too much going on," 



said Vickers. 

The whole idea was pitiful, of 
course — grown people pretending 
they lived in some other age, 
publicly confessing that they 
could not live at peace with their 
own age, but must go burrowing 
back through time to find the 
musty thrill of vicarious existence. It marked some rankling 
failure in the lives of these people, some terrible emptiness that 
would not let them be, some 
screaming vacuum that somehow 
had to be filled. 

TTE remembered the two women who had talked in the 
bus seat behind him and he wondered momentarily what illusory 
satisfaction the Pretentionist living back in Pepys' time might get 
out of it. There was, of course, 
Pepys' well filled life, the scurrying about, the meetings with 
many people, the little taverns 
where there were cheese and wine, 
the theatres, the good companionship and the midnight talks, the 
many interests that had kept 
Pepys as naturally full of life as 
these Pretentionists were empty. 

The movement itself was escapism, obviously, but escapism 
from what? From insecurity, perhaps. From a daily, ever-present 
tension that never quite bubbled 
into fear, yet never quieted into 
peace. The state, perhaps, of 
never being sure — a state of mind 



32 




 



for which all the advantages of a 
highly advanced technology could 
not compensate. 

"They must have our ice cream 
packed by now," said Mrs. Leslie, 
gathering up her gloves and purse. 
"You must come over, Mr. Vickers, and spend an evening with 
us." 

Vickers rose with her. "Some 
evening very soon," he promised. 

He knew he wouldn't and he 
knew she didn't want him to, but 
they both paid lip service to the 
old fable of hospitality. 

"Come along, Jane," said Mrs. 
Leslie. "It was nice to meet you, 
Mr. Vickers, after all these 
years. " 

Without waiting for his answer, 
she moved away. 

"Everything is fine at our house 
now," said Jane. "Mommy and 
Daddy have made up again." 

''I'm glad of that," said Vickers. 

"Daddy says he won't run 
around with women no more." 

"I'm glad to hear that, too." 

Her mother called to her across 
the store. 

"I got to go now," said Jane. 
She slipped off the chair and ran 
to her mother's side. She turned 
and waved at him as they went 
out the door. 

Poor kid, he thought, what a 
life she has ahead of her. If I had 
a little girl like that — he shut the 
thought away. There was no little 



girl for him. There was a shelf of 
books and the manuscript that 
lay waiting for him; not much to 
build a life on. 

That was the trouble with not 
himself alone, but with everyone 
— no one seemed now to have too 
much on which to build a life. 
For years the world had lived 
with war or the threat of war. 
First it had been a frantic feeling, 
a running to escape, and then it 
was just a moral and mental 
numbness that one didn't even 
notice, a condition that one accepted as the normal way of life. 

No wonder there were Pretentionists. With his books and manuscripts, he was one himself. 

HE looked under the flower pot 
in the corner of the stoop to 
find the key, but there was none, 
and then he remembered that he 
had left the house unlocked so 
that Joe could come in and get 
rid of the mice. 

He turned the knob and went 
in and made his way across the 
room to turn on the desk lamp. 
A white square of paper with 
awkward pencil scrawls upon it 
lay underneath the lamp. 

Jay: I did the job, then came back 
and opened up the windows to clean 
out the smell. I'll give you' a hundred 
bucks a throw ior every mouse you 
find. Joe. 

A noise brought him, around 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



33 



from the desk and he saw that 
there was someone on the porch, 
sitting in his favorite chair, rocking back and forth, a cigarette 
making a little wavy line dancing 
in the dark. 

"It's I," said Horton Flanders. 
"Have you had anything to eat?" 

"I grabbed a meal in the village." 

"That's a pity. I brought over 
a tray of sandwiches and some 
beer. I thought you might be 
hungry and I know how you hate 
to cook . . 

"Thanks," said Vickers. "I'm 
not hungry now. We can have 
them later." 

He threw his hat on a chair 
and went out to the porch. 

"I have your chair," said Mr. 
Flanders. 

'^eep it," Vickers said. "This 
one is just as comfortable." 

"Did you notice if there was 
any news today? I have a most 
deplorable habit, at times, of not 
looking at the papers." 

"The same old thing. Another 
peace rumor that no one quite 
believes." 

"Has it ever occurred to you, 
Mr. Vickers, that there have been 
a dozen times at least when there 
should have been real war, but 
somehow or other it has never 
come to be?" 

"I hadn't thought of it." 

"But it's the truth," said Mr. 
Flanders. "First there was the 



Berlin airlift trouble and the 
fighting in Greece. Either one of 
them could have set off a full 
scale war, but each of them was 
settled. Then there was Korea 
and that was settled, too. Iran 
later threatened to blow up the 
world, but we got safely past it. 
Then there were the Manila incidents and the flareup in Alaska 
and the Indian crisis and half a 
dozen 6thers. But all of them 
were settled, one way or another." 

"No one really wants to fight," 
said Vickers. 

"Perhaps not, but it takes more 
than just the desire for peace to 
prevent a war. Time and again 
major nations have climbed so 
far out on a limb that they had 
to fight or back up. They always 
have backed up. That isn't human nature, Mr. Vickers, or at 
least it wasn't human nature until 
thirty years ago. Does it seem to 
you that something might have 
happened, some unknown factor, 
some new equation, that may account for it?" 

"I don't see how there could 
be any new factor. The human 
race is still the human race. It's 
always fought before. Thirty 
years ago it had just finished the 
greatest war that ever had been 
fought." 

"Since then, there has been 
provocation after provocation and 
there have been regional wars, 
but the world has not gone to 



34 




 



war. Can you tell me why?" 
"No, I can't." 

"¥ HAVE thought about it," 
said Mr. Flanders, "in an 
idle way, of course. And it seems 
to me that there must be some 
new factor." 

"Fear, perhaps," suggested 
Vickers. "Fear of our frightful 
weapons." 

"That might be it, but fear is 
a funny thing. It is just as apt to 
start a war as it is to hold one 
off, make a people go out and 
fight to be rid of fear — willing to 
go against the fear itself to be 
rid of it. I don't think, Mr. Vickers, that fear alone can account 
for peace." 

"Then what factor do you 
think it might be?" 

"Intervention," Mr. Flanders 
said. 

"Intervention! Who would intervene?" 

"I really couldn't say. But the 
thought is not a new one to me 
and not in this respect alone. 
Starting about 80 years or so ago, 
something happened to the world. 
Up until that time, Man had 
stumbled along pretty much in 
the same old ruts. There had been 
some progress here and there, 
some changes, but not very many 
of them. Not many changes in 
thinking especially, and that is 
what really counts. 

"Then mankind, which had 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



been shambling along, broke into 
a gallop. The automobile was 
invented and the telephone and 
motion pictures and flying machine. There was the radio and 
all the other gadgetry that characterized the first quarter of the 
century. 

"But that was largely mechan ics, 
putting two and two together and 
having four come out. In the second quarter of the century, classical physics was largely displaced 
by a new kind of thinking, which 
admitted that it didn't know 
when it came face to face with the 
atoms and electrons. And out of 
that came theories and the physics of the atom and all the probabilities that today still are 
probabilities. 

"And that, I think, was the 
greatest stride of all — that the 
physicists who had fashioned neat 
cubicles of knowledge and had 
classified and assigned all the 
classical knowledge to fit into 
them snugly should have had the 
courage to say they didn't know 
what made electrons behave the 
way they do." 

"You're trying to say," Vickers 
put in, "that something happened 
to whip Man out of his rut. But 
it wasn't the first time a thing 
like that had happened. Before it 
there had been the Renaissance 
and the Industrial Revolution." 

"I did not say it was the only 
time it had ever happened." Mr. 

35 



Flanders told him, "I merely said 
it happened. The fact that it had 
happened before, in a slightly different manner, should prove that 
it is not an accident, but some 
sort of cycle, some sort of influence which is operative within 
the human race. What is it that 
kicks a plodding culture out of a 
shuffle into a full-fledged gallop 
and, in this case at least, keeps it 
galloping for almost a hundred 
years without a sign of slackening?" 

"You said intervention. You're 
off on some wild fantasy. Men 
from Mars, maybe?" 

Mr. Flanders shook his head. 
"Let's be a little more general." 
He waved his cigarette at the sky 
above the hedge and trees, with 
its many stars twinkling in the 
night. "Out there must be great 
reservoirs of knowledge. At many 
points in all that space beyond 
our Earth there must be thinking 
beings and they would create 
knowledge that we had never 
dreamed of. Some of it might be 
applicable to humans and to 
Earth and much of it would not." 

"You're suggesting that someone in another solar system — " 

"No," said Mr. Flanders. "I'm 
suggesting that the knowledge is 
there and waiting, waiting for us 
to go out and get it." 

"We haven't even reached the 
Moon yet." 

"We may not need to wait for 



rockets. We might reach out with 
our minds . . ." 
"Telepathy?" 

"Maybe that is the word for 
it. A mind probing out and 
searching — a mind reaching out 
for a mind. If there is such a 
thing as telepathy, distance 
should be no barrier. A half a mile 
or half across the Universe, what 
would be the difference? For the 
mind is not a physical property; 
it is not bound, or should not be 
bound, by the laws that say that 
nothing can exceed the speed of 
light." 

Vickers laughed uneasily, feeling the slow crawl of invisible, 
many-footed creatures moving on 
his neck. 

"You can't be serious," he said. 

"Perhaps I'm not," admitted 
Mr. Flanders. "Perhaps 'I'm an 
old eccentric who has found a 
man who will listen to him and 
will not laugh too much." 

"But this knowledge that you 
talk of. There is no evidence that 
it exists or that it ever could be 
applied. It would be alien. It 
woud involve alien logic and apply to alien problems and it 
would be based on alien concepts 
that we could not understand." 

"Much of it would. There 
would be much chaff, but you 
would find some kernels. You 
might find, for instance, a way in 
which friction could be eliminated 
and if you found that you would 



36 




 



have machines that would last 
forever and you would have — " 

"Wait a minute," snapped 
Vickers, tensely. "What are you 
getting at? What about this business of machines that would run 
forever? We have that already. 
I was talking to Eb just this 
morning and he was telling me — " 

"About a car. That, Mr. Vickers, is one of the things I was 
talking about." 

XI 

¥70R a long time after Mr. 
-1 Flanders left, Vickers sat on 
the porch, smoked his cigarettes 
and stared at the patch of sky he 
could see between the top of the 
hedge and the porch's roof . . . 
at the sky and its crystal wash of 
stars, thinking that one could not 
sense the distance and the time 
that lay between the stars. 

Flanders was an old man with 
a shabby coat and a polished 
stick and a queer, stilted way of 
talking that made you think of 
another era and another culture. 
What could he possibly know of 
knowledge in the stars? 

He had thought of it, he'd said, 
in an idle way. And that, Vickers 
realized, was the way it was — an 
eccentric with nothing on his 
mind except the idle speculations 
that took his mind off an old and 
faded life that he wanted to 
forget. 



And there, thought Vickers, I 
am speculating, too, for there's no 
way that I can know the kind of 
life the old man may have led. 

He got up and went into the 
living room. He pulled the chair 
out from his desk and sat down 
and stared at the typewriter sitting there, accusing him of an 
entire wasted day, pointing silently at the pile of manuscript 
that should have been a little 
thicker if he had stayed at home. 

He picked up a few pages of 
the manuscript and tried to read, 
but he had no interest and he was 
gripped by the terrifying thought 
that he had gone cold. 

He had said no, he wasn't interested in writing Crawford's 
book, and he had said it because 
he wasn't interested. And yet that 
had not been the only factor; 
there had been something else. 
Hunch, he had told Ann, and she 
had scoffed at him. But there had 
been a hunch — that and a feeling 
of danger and of fear, as if a 
second self had been standing at 
his side, warning him away. 

It was illogical, of course, for 
there was no reason why he 
should have had a sense of fear. 
He could have used the money. 
Ann could have used the fee. And 
yet, without an instant's hesitation, he had refused the offer. 

He put the sheets of manuscript back on top of the pile, rose 
from the chair and pushed it flush

which the sound had come without anything knowing he had 
turned. 

There were no mice. Joe had 
come up, while he was in the city, 
and had killed the mice. There 
should be no scurrying from one 
corner to the next. Joe had left a 
note which even now still lay 
beneath the desk lamp saying 
that he would pay one hundred 
bucks a throw for every mouse 
that Vickers could produce. 

The silence hung, not so much 
a silence as a quietness, as if 
everything was waiting without 
breathing. 

Moving only his eyeballs, for 
it seemed that if he turned his 
head his neck would creak and 
betray him to whatever danger 
there might be, Vickers examined 
the room, the darkened areas in 
the corners and underneath the 
furniture and in the shadowed 
places that were farthest from the 
light. Cautiously he put his hands 
behind him, to grasp the desk 
edge, to get hold of something 
J:hat was solid so that he did hot 
stand so agonizingly alone, transfixed in the room. 

The fingers of his right hand 
touched something that was me 
tallic and he knew it was the 
metal paperweight that he had 
lifted off the pile of manuscrip' 
when he? 4iad>s«t^aow.n at the 
desk!" His fingew reached out and 
grasped lrXfind dragged it for


ward into the hollow of his hand 
and he closed his fingers on it 
and he had a weapon. 

There was something in the 
corner by the yellow chair and 
although it seemed to have no 
eyes, he knew it was watching 
him. It didn't know that he had 
spotted it, or it didn't seem to 
know. 

"Now!" said Vickers. 

His right arm swung up and 
over and followed through and 
the paperweight, turning end for 
end, crashed into the corner. 

There was a crunching sound 
and the noise of metallic parts 
rolling on the floor. 

XII 

THERE were many little tubes, 
smashed, and .*n„ intricate 




RING AROUND THE SUN 



39 



mass of wiring that was bent and 
broken, and crystal disks that 
were chipped and splintered, and 
the metallic outer shell that had 
held the tubes and wiring and the 
disks and the many other pieces 
of mechanical mystery that he 
did not recognize. 

Vickers pulled the desk lamp 
closer to him, so that the light 
might shine down upon the handful of parts he had gathered from 
the floor and he put out a finger 
and stirred it among them, gingerly, listening to the tinkling 
sounds they made as they clinked 
together. 

No mouse, but something else 
— something that scuttled in the 
night, knowing that he would 
think it was a mouse; a thing that 
had scaled the cat which knew 
it was no mouse, and a thing that 
would not be attracted to traps. 

An electronic spy, he speculated, a scuttling, scurrying, listening device that watched his 
every moment, that stored what 
it heard and saw for future reference or transmitted directly the 
knowledge that it gained. But 
direct to whom? And why? If it 
were a spying device, it would be 
made so well, so cleverly that it 
would be able not only to observe him, but to keep out of sight 
itself. To have any value, it must 
keep its presence undetected. 
There would have been no careless moment. It would not have 



been seen unless it wanted itself 
to be seen. 

Untess it wanted itseli to be 
seen! 

He had been sitting at the desk 
and had gotten up and pushed 
the chair flush with the desk and 
it had been then that he had 
heard the scampering. If it had 
not run, he never would have 
seen it. And it need not have run, 
for the room was in shadow, with 
only the desk lamp burning, and 
his back had been toward the 
room. 

The cold certainty came to 
him that it had wanted to be seen, 
that it had wanted to be trapped 
in a corner and crushed with a 
paperweight — that it had run deliberately to call his attention to 
it and that once he'd seen it, it 
had not tried to get away.' 

He sat at the desk and perspiration chilled his forehead. 

It had wanted to be, seen. It 
had wanted him to know. 

Not it, of course, but whoever 
or whatever it was that had 
caused the contraption to be 
placed inside his house. For 
months it had scampered and 
scurried like a mouse, had listened and watched, and now the 
scampering and the watching had 
come to an end and it was time 
for something else; time to serve 
notice on him that he was being 
watched. 

But why and who? 



40 




 



¥TE fought down the cold, 
screaming panic that rose inside of him, forced himself to 
stay sitting in the chair. 

There was a clue somewhere in 
this very day, he thought, if he 
could recognize it. Something 
happened today that made the 
someone behind the watcher decide it was time to let him know. 

He ticked off the day's events, 
marshaling them in his mind as 
they might be written in a notebook: 

The moppet who had come to 
breakfast. 

The remembrance of a walk 
that he had taken twenty years 
before. 

The story in the paper about 
more worlds than one. 

The Forever car. 

The women who had talked in 
the seat behind him on the bus, 
and Mrs. Leslie and the club she 
was organizing. 

Crawford and his story of a 
world with its back against the 
waif. 

The houses at five hundred a 
room. 

Mr. Flanders sitting on the 
porch and saying that there was 
a new-found factor which kept 
the world from war. 

The mouse that was not a 
mouse. 

But that wasn't all, of course; 
somewhere there was something 
else that he had forgotten. With


out knowing how he knew it, he 
was aware that he had forgotten 
some other fact that should be 
inserted in the list of things that 
had happened in the day. 

There was Flanders saying that 
he was interested in the setup of 
the gadget shops and that he was 
intrigued by the riddle of the 
carbohydrates and that he was 
convinced there was something 
going on. 

And later in the day he had sat 
on the porch and talked of reservoirs of knowledge in the stars 
and of a factor which kept the 
world from war and of another 
factor which had whipped Man 
out of his rut almost a hundred 
years ago and had kept him at 
the gallop ever since. 

He had speculated about these 
matters in an idle way, he had 
said. 

But was his speculation idle? 

Or did Flanders know more 
than he was telling? 

And if he knew, what then? 

Vickers shoved back the chair 
and got to his feet. 

He looked at the time. It was 
almost two o'clock. 

No matter, he thought. It's 
time that I find out, even if I 
have to break into his house and 
jerk him out of bed, screaming in 
his nightshirt. 

He was sure that Flanders 
would wear a nightshirt instead 
of pajamas.

¥ ONG before he reached Flanders' house, Vickers saw that 
there was something wrong. The 
place was lighted up from basement to garret. Men with lanterns 
were walking about the yards and 
there were other knots of men 
who stood around and talked , 
while all along the street women 
and children stood ofTthe porches 
in hastily snatched-up robes. As 
if, Vickers thought, they were 
waiting for a strange three A.M. 
parade that might at any momerit come winding down the 
street. 

A group of men were standing 
by the gate and as he turned in, 
he saw there were some he knew. 
There was Kb. the garage man, 
and Joe, the exterminator man, 
and Vic, who ran the drugstore. 

"Hello, Jay," said Eb, "we're 
glad you are here." 

"Hello, Jay," said Joe. 

"What's going on?" asked 
Vickers. 

"Old Man Flanders," said Vic, 
"has disappeared." 

"His housekeeper got up in the 
night to give him some medicine," said Eb, "and found he 
wasn't there. She looked around 
for him for a while and then she 
went to get some help." 

"You've searched for him?" 
asked Vickers. 

"Around the place," said Eb. 



"But we're going to start branching out now. We'll have to organize and get some system in 
it." 

The drugstore owner said, "We 
thought at first maybe he'd been 
up during the night wandering 
around the house or out into the 
yard and might have had a seizure 
of one kind or another. So we 
looked near at hand at first." 

"We've gone over the house," 
said Joe, "from top to bottom 
and we've combed the yard and 
there ain't hide nor hair of him." 

"Maybe he went for a walk," 
Vickers offered. 

"No man in his right mind," 
declared Joe, "goes walking after 
midnight." 

"He wasn't in his right mind, 
if you ask me," said Eb. "Not 
that I didn't like him. I did. 
Never saw a more mannerly old 
codger in all my born days, but 
he had funny ways about him." 

Someone with a lantern came 
down the brick-paved walk. 

"You men ready to get organized?" asked the man with the 
lantern. 

"Sure, Sheriff." said Eb. "Any 
time you are. We just been waiting for you to get it figured out." 

"Well," said the sheriff, "there 
ain't much that we can do until 
it gets light, but I thought we 
might take some quick scouts out 
around. Some of the other boys 
are going to cover the town, go 



42 




 



up and down all the streets and 
alleys, and I figured maybe some 
of you might like to have a look 
along the river." 

"That's all right with us," said 
Eb. "You just tell us what you 
want us to do." 

THHE sheriff lifted his lantern 
to shoulder height and looked 
at them. "Jay Vickers, ain't it? 
Glad you joined us, Jay. We need 
all the men there are." 

Vickers lied, without knowing 
why he lied: "I heard some commotion going on." 

"Guess you knew the old gent 
pretty well," said the sheriff. 
"Better than the most of us." 

"He used to come over and talk 
to me almost every day." 

"I know. We remarked about 
it. He never talked much to no 
one else." 

"We had some common interests." Vickers said, "and I think 
that he was lonely." 

"The housekeeper said he went 
over to see you last night." 

"Yes, he did," said Vickers. 
"He left shortly after midnight." 

"Notice anything unusual about 
him? Any difference in the way 
he talked?" 

"Now, look here. Sheriff," said 
Eb. "You think Jay had anything 
to do with this?" 

"No, I guess I don't." He lowered the lantern and said, "If you 
fellows would go down to the 

RING AROUND THE SUN 



river — split up when you get 
there — some of you go upstream 
and some of you go down. I don't 
expect you to find anything, but 
we might as well look. Be back at 
daylight and we'll really start 
combing for him." 

The sheriff turned away, walking back up the brick pavement 
with his lantern swinging. 

"I guess," said Eb, "we might 
as well get started. I'll take one 
bunch down the river and Joe 
will take the others up. That all 
right with the rest of you?" 

There was no objection. 

They walked out the gate and 
down the street until they hit the 
intersection, then went down to 
the bridge. 

"We split up here," said Eb. 
"Who wants to go with Joe?" 

Several men said they would. 

"All right," said Eb. "The rest 
of you come with me." 

They separated and plunged 
down from the street to the river 
bank. Cold river mist lay close 
along the bank and in the darkness they could hear the swift, 
smooth rush of the river. A night 
bird cried across the water. Looking out to the other bank, one 
could see the splintered starlight 
that shattered itself against the 
running current. 

Eb asked, "You think we'll 
find him, Jay?" 

Vickers spoke slowly. "No, I 
don't. I can't tell you why, but 

43 



somehow I am pretty sure we 
won't." 

XIV 

TT was early evening before 
Vickers returned home. The 
phone was ringing when he 
stepped inside the door. 

It was Ann Carter. "I've been 
trying to get you all day. I'm 
terribly upset. Where have you 
been?" 

"Out looking for a man," said 
Vickers. 

"Please don't be funny, Jay." 

"I'm not being funny. An old 
man, a neighbor of mine, disappeared. I've been out helping look 
for him." 

"Did you find him?" 

"l>to, we didn't." 

"That's too bad," she said. 
"Was he a nice old man?" 

"The best." 

"Maybe you'll find him later." 

"Maybe we will," said Vickers. 
"Why are you upset?" 

"You remember what Crawford said?" 

"He said a lot of things." 

"But what he told us would 
come next. You remember that?" 

"I can't say that I do." 

"He said clothing would be 
next. A dress for fifty cents." 

"Now that you mention it," 
said Vickers, "he did." 

"Well, it happened." 

"What happened?" 



"A dress. Only it wasn't fifty 
cents. It was fifteen!" 

"You bought one?" 

"No, I didn't, Jay. I was too 
scared. I was walking down Fifth 
Avenue and there was a sign in 
the window, a little discreet sign 
that said the dress on the model 
could be had for fifteen cents. 
Can you imagine that. Jay — a 
dress for fifteen cents on Fifth 
Avenue!" 

"No, I can't," Vickers confessed. 

"It was such a pretty dress," 
said Ann. "It shone. Not with 
stones or tinsel. The material 
shone. Like it was alive. And the 
color . . . Jay, it was the prettiest 
dress I have ever seen. And I 
could have bought it for fifteen 
cents, but I didn't have the nerve. 
I remembered what Crawford 
had told us and I stood there 
looking at the dress and I got 
cold all over." 

"Buck up. and go back in the 
morning. Maybe they'll still have 
it." 

"rpHAT isn't the point at all. 
_ -■- Don't you see? It proves what 
Crawford told us! It proves that 
he knew what he was talking 
about, that there really is a conspiracy, that the world does have 
its back against the wall." 

"And what do you want me to 
do about it?" 

"Why, I — I don't know, Jay. 



44 



GALAXY S C 1 E N C E FICTION 



I thought you would be interested." 

"I am," said Vickers. "Very 
interested." 

"Jay. there's something going 
on." 

"Keep your shirt on, Ann," 
said Vickers. "Sure, there's something going on." 

"What is it? I know it's more 
than Crawford said. I don't know 
how — " 

"I don't know, either. But it's 
bigger than you and I can handle. 
I have to think it out." 

"Jay." she said, and the sharp 
tenseness was gone from her 
voice. "Jay, I feel better now. It 
was nice to talk to you." 

"You go out in the morning," 
Jay told her," and buy up an armful of those fifteen-cent dresses. 
Get there ahead of the crowd." 

"The crowd? I don't understand." 

"Look, Ann," said Vickers. 
"Let us use our head. Fifth Avenue is going to have a crush of 
bargain hunters." 

"I guess you're right at that," 
she said. "Phone me tomorrow?" 

"I'll phone." 

They said good night and he 
hung up, stood for a moment, 
trying to remember the next 
thing that he should do. There 
was supper to get and the papers 
to bring in and he'd better see if 
there was any mail. 

He went out the door and 



walked down the path to the 
mailbox on the gatepost. He took 
out a slim handful of letters and 
leafed through them swiftly, but 
there was so little light he could 
not make out what they were. 
Advertising mostly, he suspected. 
And a few bills, although it was 
a bit early in the month for 
them. 

Back in the house he turned on 
the desk lamp and laid the pile 
of letters on the desk. Beneath 
the lamp lay the litter of tubes 
and disks that he had picked up 
from the floor the night before. 
He stood there staring at them, 
trying to bring them into correct 
perspective. It had only been the 
night before, but now it seemed 
as if it were many weeks ago that 
he had thrown the paperweight 
and there had been a crunching 
sound that had erupted with a 
shower of tiny parts rolling on 
the floor. 

He had stood there then, as 
he stood now. and knew there 
was an answer, a clue, if he only 
knew where to find it. 

A GAIN the phone rang and he 
went to answer it. 
It was Eb, asking, "What do 
you think of it?" 

"I don't know what to think," 
said Vickers. 

"He's in the river," Eb maintained. "That is where he is. 
That's what I told the sheriff. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



45 



They'll start dragging tomorrow 
morning as soon as the sun is up." 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"Maybe you're right, but I don't 
think he's dead." 

"Why don't you think so. Jay?" 

"No reason in the world," said 
Vickers. "No actual , solid rea son. Just a hunch." 

"The reason I called," Eb told 
him, "is that I got some of those 
Forever cars. Came in this afternoon. Thought maybe you might 
want one of them." 

"I hadn't thought much about 
it, Eb. Too many other things 
on my mind, I suppose." 

"I'll bring one up in the morning. Give you . a chance to try 
it out. See what you think of it." 

"That'll be fine," said Vickers, 
and said good-by. 

He went back to the desk and 
picked up the letters. There were 
no bills. Of the seven letters, six 
were advertising, the seventh in 
a plain white envelope addressed 
in a craggy hand. 

He tore it open. There was one 
sheet of white note paper, neatly 
folded. He unfolded it and read: 

My dear friend Vickers: 

I hope that you are not unduly 
worn out by the strenuous efforts 
which you undoubtedly will have 
thrown into the search for me today. 

I feel very keenly that my actions 
will impose upon the kind people of 
this excellent village a most unseemly 
amount of running around to the 
neglect of their business, though J do 



not doubt that they wilt enjoy it most 
thoroughly. 

I feel that I can trust your understanding not to reveal the fact of this 
fetter nor to engage any further than 
is necessary to convince our neighbors 
of your kindly intentions in what must 
necessarily be a futile hunt for me. I 
can assure you that I am most happy 
and that only the necessity of the 
moment made me do what I have done. 

I am writing this note for two reasons: First, to quiet any fear you may 
feel lor me. Secondly, to presume upon 
our friendship to the point of giving 
some unsolicited advice. 

It has seemed to me for some time 
now that you have been confining 
yourself too closely to your work and 
that a holiday might be an excellent 
idea, ft might be that a visit to your 
childhood scene, to walk again the 
paths you walked when you were a 
boy, could clear away the dust and 
make you see with clearer eyes. 
Your friend, 

H or ton Flanders 

XV 

T WILL not go, thought Vickers. 

I cannot go. The place means 
nothing to me and I do not want 
it to mean anything now that it is 
forgotten after all these years of 
trying to forget it. 

He could have shut his eyes 
and seen it — the yellow clay of 
the rain-washed cornfields, the 
roads all white with dust winding 
through the valleys and along the 
ridgetops, the lonely mailboxes 
sitting on forlornly leaning fence 
posts, the sagging gates, the 




 



weatherbeaten houses, the scraggy 
cattle coming down the lane, following the rutted path that their 
hoofs had made, the mangy dogs 
that ran out and barked at you 
when you drove past their farms. 

If I go back they'll ask me 
why I came and how I'm getting 
on. "Too bad about your Pa, he 
was a damn good man." They'd 
sit on the upturned boxes in front 
of the general store and chew 
slowly on their cuds of tobacco 
and spit out on the sidewalk and 
look at hin> out of slanted eyes 
and say, "So you write books. 
By God, some day I'll have to 
read one of your books; I never 
heard of them." 

He'd go to the cemetery and 
stand before a stone with his hat 
held in his hand and listen to the 
wind moan in the mighty pines, 
and he'd think, if only I could 
have amounted to something in 
time for you to have known, so 
that the two of you could have 
been proud of me and bragged 
about me a little when the neighbors dropped in for a visit — but, 
of course, I never did. 

And he would — finally, he admitted it — drive past the great 
brick house with the portico and 
the fanlights above the door. He 
would drive very slowly and he 
would look at it and see how the 
shutters had come loose and were 
sagging and how the paint was 
flaking and how the roses that 



had bloomed beside the gate had 
died. 

I won't go, he said. 

And yet, perhaps, he should. 

It might clear away the dust, 
Flanders had written, might make 
you see with clearer eyes. 

Might make him see what with 
clearer eyes? 

Was there something back 
there in his boyhood lanes that 
could explain this situation, some 
hidden fact, some abstract symbol, which he had missed before? 

Or was he imagining things, 
reading significance into words 
that had no significance? How 
could he be sure that Horton 
Flanders with his shabby suit and 
ridiculous cane had anything to 
do with the story that Crawford 
had spelled out about humanity 
standing with its back against the 
wall? 

There was no evidence at all. 

Yet Flanders had disappeared 
and had written him a letter. 

Clear away the dust, Flanders 
had written, so that you may see 
better. And all that he might 
have meant' was that he should 
clear away the dust so that he 
could write better. 

VICKERS put a hand on the 
manuscript and ruffled its 
pages with his thumb, an absent, 
almost loving gesture. So little 
done, he thought, so much still 
ed out the top drawer on the left 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



he'd done nothing on it. Two full, 
days wasted. 

To do the writing that should 
be done, he must be able to sit 
down calmly and concentrate , 
shut out the world and then let 
the world come in to him, a little 
at a time, a highly selected world 
that could be analyzed and set 
up with a clarity and sharpness 
that could not be mistaken. 

Calmly, he thought. How can a 
man be calm when he has a thousand questions and a thousand 
doubts boiling in his mind? 

FIRST was the moppet who 
had come to breakfast and 
after that the paper he had read. 
Then he'd gone down to get his 
car and Eb had told him about 
the Forever car. Because his car 
had not been ready, he'd gone to 
the drugstore corner to catch a 
bus. Mr. Flanders had come and 
joined him as he stared at the 
display in the gadget shop and 
Mr. Flanders had said — 

Wait a second. He had gone 
to the drugstore corner to get a 
bus. He had gotten on the bus 
and sat down in a seat next to the 
window. He'd looked out the window and no one else had come 
and sat down with him. He'd ridden to the city in a seat all to 
himself. 

That is it, he thought, and 
even as he thought it he felt a 
wild elation and then a sense of 



horror at an incident forgotten 
and he stood for a moment unmoving, trying desperately to blot 
out what had happened so many 
years ago. It would not blot out 
and he knew at once what he 
must do. 

He turned to the desk and pullto do. Now, for two whole days, 
side and slowly, methodically, 
took out the contents, one by 
one. He did this with all the 
drawers and did not find what 
he was looking for. 

The attic, perhaps. One of the 
boxes up there. 

He climbed the stairs and, 
reaching the top, blinked at the 
glow of the unshielded light bulb 
hanging from the ceiling. There 
was a chill in the air and in the 
starkness of the rafters, coming 
down on either side of him, like 
a mighty jaw about to close. 

Vickers went from the stairs 
to the storage boxes pushed 
against the eaves. In which one 
of the three would it be most 
likely to be found? He had no 
idea whatever. 

So he started with the first 
and he found it halfway down, 
under the old pair of bird shooters that he had hunted for last 
fall and had finally given up 
for lost. 

He opened the notebook and 
thumbed through it until he came 
finally to the pages that he was 
seeking. 



48 




 



XVI 

IT must have been going on for 
years before he noticed it. The 
record said that it was worse 
than he had first imagined, that 
it concerned not only one phase 
of his existence, but many different phases. As the evidence accumulated, he stood aghast that 
he had not realized it before, because it was something which 
should have been obvious from 
the very first. 

The whole thing started with 
the reluctance of his fellow passengers to ride with him on the 
bus. He lived at the time in an 
old ramshackle boarding house at 
the edge of town near the end of 
the line. He'd get on in the morning and, being one of the few who 
boarded at that point, would take 
his favorite seat. 

The bus would fill up gradually 
as the stops were made, but it 
would be almost the end of the 
run before he'd have a seat companion. It didn't bother him, of 
course; in fact, he rather liked it 
that way, for then he could slump 
down in the seat and think and 
probably even doze a little without ever considering the need of 
civility. Not that he would have 
been especially civil in any case, 
he now admitted. The hour that 
he went to work was altogether 
too early for that. 

People would get on the bus 



and they'd sit with other people, 
not necessarily people whom they 
knew, for sometimes, Vickers noticed, they didn't exchange a single word for the entire ride with 
their seat mate. They'd sit with 
other people, but they'd never sit 
with him until all the other seats 
were filled and they had to sit 
with him or stand. 

Perhaps, he had told himself, 
it was body odor ; perhaps it 
was bad breath. He had made a 
ritual of bathing after that, using 
a new soap that was guaranteed 
to make him smell fresh. He 
brushed his teeth more attentively, used mouth wash until he 
gagged at the sight of it. 

It did no good. He still rode 
alone. 

He looked at himself in the 
mirror and he knew it was not his 
clothes, for in those days he was a 
smart dresser. 

So, he figured, it must be his 
attitude. Instead of slumping 
down in the seat, he'd sit up 
and be bright and cheerful and 
he'd smile at everyone. He'd smile 
if it cracked his face to do it. 

For an entire week he had sat 
there looking pleasant, smiling 
at people when they glanced at 
him, for all the world as if he 
were. a rising young business man 
who had read Dale Carnegie and 
belonged to the Junior Chamber. 

No one rode with him — not until there was no other seat. He 



RING AROUND THE 5UN 



49 



got some comfort in knowing 
they'd rather sit with him than 
stand. 

THHEN he had noticed other 
things. At the office, the fellows were always visiting around, 
gathering in little groups of three 
or four at one of the desks, talking about their golf scores or 
telling the latest dirty story or 
wondering why the hell a guy 
stayed on at a place like this 
when there were other jobs he 
could just walk out and take. 

No one ever came to his desk, 
so he tried joining one of the 
groups. Within a short time, the 
fellows would all drift back to 
their desks. He tried dropping 
by to pass the time of the day 
with individual workers. They 
were stlways affable enough, but 
always terribly busy. Vickers 
never stayed. 

He checked up on his conversational budget. It seemed fairly 
satisfactory. He didn't play golf, 
but he knew a few good stories 
and he read most of the latest 
books and saw the best of the 
recent movies. He could damn 
the office with the best of them, 
even though he liked working 
there. He read the newspapers 
and went through a couple of 
news weeklies and knew what was 
going on and could argue politics 
and had armchair opinions on 
military matters. With those 



qualifications, he felt, he should 
be able to carry on a fair conversation. But still no one seemed 
to want to talk to him. 

It was the same at lunch. It 
was the same, now that he had 
come to notice it, everywhere he 
went. 

He had written it down for a 
full six months, with dates and 
an account of each day, and now, 
fifteen years later, he sat on a 
box in a raw and empty attic and 
read the words he'd written. 
Staring straight ahead of him, he 
remembered how it had been, how 
he'd felt and what he'd said and 
done including the fact that no 
one would ride with him until 
all the seats were taken. And that 
was what had happened when 
he'd gone to New York just the 
other day. 

Why? 

He'd asked himself the question 
all those years ago and now, at 
last, he thought he knew the 
answer. 

It was because he was diff erent 
in some way, in some subtle way 
you couldn't put a finger on, but 
one that you could sense. 

A group of dogs would not 
tolerate a strange dog. They 
would smell him over and insult 
him and gang up on him and 
drive him away. 

Strange dog, he thought, that 
is what I am. A strange dog 
among the normal, barnyard dogs 



50 




 



of the human race. And these 
normal dogs do not accept me. 
They smell me over and walk 
stiff -legged and keep a wary eye 
upon me and at times, perhaps, 
they may even fear or hate me. 
My God, what am I? 

XVII 

SOMEONE was hammering on 
the door downstairs and shouting, but it was a moment or two 
before he realized it was his name 
that was being called. 

He rose from the box and the 
notebook fell from his fingers and 
fell rumpled on the floor, face 
downward, with its open pages 
caught and crumpled.^ 

"Jay!" the voice shouted. "Jay, 
are you here?" 

He stumbled down the stairs 
and into the living room. Eb stood 
just inside the door. 

"What's the matter, Eb?" 
"Listen, Jay," Eb told him, 
"you got to get out of here." 
"What for?" 

"They think you did away with 
Flanders." 

Vickers reached out a hand and 
caught the back of a chair and 
hung onto it. 

"I won't even ask you if you 
did," said Eb. "I'm pretty sure 
you didn't. That's why I'm giving 
you a chance." 

"A chance?" asked Vickers. 
"What are you talking about?" 



"They're down at the tavern 
now, talking themselves into a 
lynching party." 

"They?" 

"All your friends," Eb said, bitterly. "Someone got them all 
stirred up. I don't know who it 
was. I didn't wait to find out 
who. I came straight up here." 

"But I liked Flanders. I was 
the only friend he had." 

"You haven't any time," Eb 
said. "You've got to get away." 

"I can't go anywhere. I haven't 
got my car." 

"I brought up one of the Forever cars," said Eb. "No one 
knows I brought it. No one will 
know you have it." 

"I can't run away. They've got 
to listen to me." 

"You damn fool, this isn't the 
sheriff with a warrant. It's a mob 
and they won't listen to you." 
He strode across the room and 
grabbed Vickers roughly by the 
arm. "I risked my neck to come 
up here and warn you. After I've 
done that, you can't throw the 
chance away." 

Vickers shook the hand off. 
"All right, I'll go." 

"Money?" asked Eb. 

"I have some." 

"Here's some more." Eb reached into his pocket and held out a 
thin sheaf of bills. 

Vickers took it and stuck it in 
his pocket. 

"The car is full of gas," -said

Eb. "The shift is automatic. It 
drives like any other car. I left 
the motor running." 

"I hate to do this, Eb." 

"I know just how you hate to, 
but if you want to save this town 
a killing, there's nothing else to 
do. Come on, get going." 

VICKERS trotted down the 
path and heard Eb pounding 
along behind him. The car stood 
at the gate. Eb had left the 
door wide open. 

"In you go," said Eb. "Cut 
straight over to the main highway." 

"Thanks, Eb." 
"Get out of here." 
Vickers pulled the shift to the 
drive position and stepped on 
the gK. The car floated away and 
swiftly gathered speed. He reached the main highway and swung 
in toward the west. 

He drove for miles, fleeing 
down the cone of brightness 
thrown by the headlights. He 
drove with a numb bewilderment 
that he should be doing this — 
that he, Jay Vickers, should be 
fleeing from a lynching party 
made up of his home town 
friends. 

They were not his friends, he 
reminded himself. They were the 
barnyard dogs and he was the 
strange dog -that had wandered 
in. He thought of them one by 
one, and as he thought of them 



their lips pulled back to reveal 
their fangs and there a savage 
growl rumbling in their throats. 

Someone, Eb had said, had got 
them all stirred up. Someone, 
perhaps, who hated ' him? But 
there was no one who hated him. 
No one he could think of. 

But even as he thought it, he 
knew who it was. He felt again 
the threat and the fear that he 
had felt when he had sat face 
to face with Crawford — the thenunrealized reaction that had made 
him refuse the offer to write 
Crawford's book. 

There's something going on, 
Horton Flanders had said, standing with him in front of the 
gadget shop. 

And there was something going on. 

There were everlasting gadgets 
being made by nonexistent firms. 
There was an organization of 
world businessmen, backed into a 
corner by a foe at whom they 
could not strike back. There was 
Horton Flanders talking of some 
new, strange factors which kept 
the world from war. There were 
Pretentionists, hiding from the 
actuality of today, playing dollhouse with the past. 

And, finally, here was Jay 
Vickers fleeing to the west. 

By midnight, he knew where 
he was going — where Horton 
Flanders had said that he should 
go, doing what he had said he 



52 




 



would certainly never do. 

He was going back to his own 
childhood. 

XVIII 

T^XACTLY the way he had expected, they sat out in front 
of the general store, on the bench 
and the upturned boxes, and 
turned sly eyes up toward him 
and they said: "Too bad about 
your Pa, Jay. He was a damn 
good man." 

They said : "So you write 
books, do you? Have to read one 
of your books someday. Never 
heard of them." 

They said : "You going out to 
the old place?" 

"This afternoon," said Vickers. 

"It's changed a whole lot. 
There ain't no one living there." 

"No one?" 

"Farming's gone to hell. Can't 
make no money at it. This carbohydrates business. Lots of folks 
can't keep their places. Farms 
around here being bought up for 
grazing — just fix the fences and 
turn some cattle in. Don't even 
try to farm. Buy feeder stuff 
out in the west and turn it loose 
the summer, then fatten it for 
fall." 

"That's what happened to the 
old place?" 

"That's what happened. Feller 
that bought it after your Pa, 
he couldn't make the riffle. Your 



Pa's place ain't the only one. 
There's been lots of others, too. 
You remember the old Preston 
place, don't you?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"Well, it happened there, too. 
And that was a good place. One 
of the best there was." 

"No one living there?" 

"No one. Somebody boarded 
up the doors and windows. Now 
why do you figure anyone would 
go to all the work of boarding 
up the place?" 

"I wouldn't know," said Vickers. 

The storekeeper came out and 
sat down on the steps. 

"Where you hanging out now, 
Jay?" he asked. 

"In the East." 

"Doing right well, I expect." 

"I'm eating every day." 

"Well," the storekeeper said, 
"anyone that can eat regular is 
doing downright well." 

"What kind of car is that you 
got?" another of them asked. 

"It's a new kind of car," said 
Vickers. "Just got it the other 
day. Called the Forever car." 

They said : "Now ain't that a 
hell of a name to call a car?" 

They said: "I imagine it cost 
you a pile." 

They said: "How many miles 
to a gallon do you get on it?" 

"I havtf to go now," Vickers 
replied, a little frantically. "See 
you on my way back."

He climbed into the car and 
sped away through the dowdy 
little village, anxious to go where 
there would be answers instead 
of questions, for he saw now that 
his own questions were even more 
urgent than he had suspected. 

XIX 

iHE gate to the farm was 
-■- chained and locked, so he 
parked the car beside the highway and walked the quarter mile 
down to the buildings. 

The farm road was overgrown 
with grass in places and kneehigh with weeds in others and 
only here and there could you 
find the sign of wheel-ruts. Some 
windows in the house were broken, probably by kids, and the 
door to the back porch had become unlocked and was swinging in the wind. 

• He waded through the sea of 
grass, walking around the house, 
astonished at how tenaciously the 
marks of living still clung about 
the place. There, on the chimney, 
running up the outside wall, were 
the prints of his ten -year old 
hands, impressed into wet mortar. At the corner of the house 
he found the old washtub where 
his mother each spring had planted the nasturtians, but the tub 
itself was almost goner its metal 
turned to rust and all that remained was a mound of earth. 



He did not try the door, for 
the outside was all he wished to 
see. There would be too much to 
see inside — the nail holes on the 
wall where the pictures had been 
hung and the marks on the floor 
where the stove had stood and 
the stairway with the treads 
worn smooth by beloved footsteps. If he went in, the house 
would cry out to him from the 
silences of its closets and the 
emptiness of its rooms. 

He walked down to the other 
buildings and they, for all their 
own silence and emptiness, were 
not so memory -haunted as the 
house. The henhouse was falling 
in and the hoghouse was a place 
for the winter winds to whistle 
through and he found an old, 
worn-out binder stored in the 
back of the cavernous machine 
shed. 

The barn was cool and shadowed. The stalls were empty, but 
the hay still hung in cobwebby 
wisps from the cracks in the floor 
of the mow and the place still had 
the half-misty, half-acid smell of 
living, friendly beasts. 

He climbed the incline to the 
granary and, sliding back the 
wooden latch, went in. Mice ran 
squeaking across the floor and up 
the walls and beams. A pile of 
grain sacks was draped across 
the partition that held the grain 
back from the alley way and a 
broken harness hung from a peg 



54 




 



upon the wall and there, at the 
end of alley, lay something that 
stopped him. 

TT was a child's top, battered 
now and with all its color 
gone, but once it had been bright 
and colorful and when it was 
pumped on the floor, it had spun 
and whistled. He had received it 
for Christmas and it had been a 
favorite toy of his. 

He picked it up and held its 
battered metal with a sudden 
tenderness and wondered how it 
had gotten there. It was a part of 
his past catching up with him — 
a dead and useless thing to everyone in all the world except the 
boy to whom it had once belonged. 

It had been a striped top and 
the colors had run in spiraling 
streaks when you spun it and 
there had been a point, he remembered, where each streak ran and 
disappeared. You could sit for 
hours watching the streaks come 
up and disappear, trying to make 
out where they went. For they 
must go somewhere, a boyish 
mind would figure. They couldn't 
be there one second and be gone 
the next. There must be somewhere for them to go. 

And there had been somewhere 
for them to go! 

You could go where the streaks 
went, into the land they fled to, 
if you were very young and could 



wonder hard enough. 

It was a sort of fairyland, al 
though it seemed more real than 
a fairyland should be. There was 
a walk that looked as if it were 
made of glass and there were 
birds and flowers and trees and 
some butterflies and he picked 
one of the flowers and carried it 
in his hand as he walked along 
the path. He had seen a little 
house hidden in a grove and 
when he saw it, he became a little 
frightened and walked back along 
the path and suddenly he was 
home, with the top dead on the 
floor in front of him and the flower clutched in his hand. 

He had told his mother and 
she had snatched away the flower, 
as if she'd been afraid of it. And 
well she might have been, for 
it was winter. 

That evening Pa had questioned him and found out about 
the top and the next day, when 
he*d looked for the top, he 
couldn't find it anywhere. He had 
cried off and on for days, secretly of course. 

And here it was again, an old 
and battered top, with no hint of 
the original color, but the same 
one, he was sure. 

He left the granary, carrying 
the battered top along with him. 
Through all the years, he had not 
remembered it, had not even suspected that there was an incident 
such as this hidden in his mind. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



55 



But now the top was with him 
once again and the day was with 
him, too — the day he'd followed 
the swirling streaks and walked 
into fairyland. 

XX 

HE told himself he would not 
stop at the Preston house. 
He would drive by and have a 
look at it, but he would not stop. 
For he was fleeing now. He had 
found an artifact of childhood 
that now brought only pain and 
frustration. 

He wouldn't stop at the Preston 
house. He'd just slow down and 
look, then speed up the car and 
put the miles behind him. 
He wouldn't stop, he said. 
Bufc of course, he did. 
He sat in the car and gazed 
at the house and remembered 
that it once had been proud and 
had sheltered a family that had 
been proud as well — too proud 
to let a member of its family 
marry a country lad from a farm 
of sickly corn and yellow clay. 

But the house was proud no 
longer. The shutters were closed 
and someone had nailed long 
planks across them. The paint 
was scaling and peeling from the 
stately columns that ran across 
its front. 

He got out of the car and 
walked through the drooping 
front gate up to the porch. Climb


ing the stairs, lie saw how the 
floor boards had rotted. 

He stood where the two of 
them first had known their love 
would last forever and he tried 
to catch that moment of the past 
and it was not there. He tried 
to remember how the meadows 
and the fields and yard had 
looked from the porch, with the 
white moonlight upon them. He 
knew, but he could not feel or 
see them. 

On the slope behind the house 
were the barns. Beyond them, the 
ground sloped down and there 
stretched out before him the valley they had walked that last 
time he had seen her. 

It had been an enchanted valley, he remembered, with apple 
blossoms and the song of lark. 

It had been enchanted once. It 
had not been the second time. But 
what about the third? 

He told himself that he was 
chasing rainbow ends, but while 
he told himself, he was walking 
down the slope, down past the 
barns and on into the valley. 

At the head of it, he stopped 
and looked and it was not enchanted, but he remembered it, 
as he had remembered the moonlight on the columns. He saw the 
crab apple thickets, with the blossoms fallen now, and once a lark 
soared out of the grass and flew 
into the sky. 

But the third visit here had 



56 




 



been the same as the second. 
It had been she who had turned 
this prosaic valley into an enchanted place. It had been, after 
all, an enchantment of the spirit. 

Twice he had walked in enchanted places. 

Twice. Once because of a girl 
and the love between them. Once 
again because of a spinning top. 

No, the top had been the first. 

Yes, the top — 

Now wait a minute! Not so 
fast! 

You're wrong, Vickers. It 
wouldn't be that way. 

You crazy fool, what are you 
running for? 

XXI 

THE manager of the dime store, 
when Vickers sought him out, 
seemed to understand. 

"You know," he said, "I understand just how you feel. I had 
a top like that myself when I 
was a kid. There's nothing like 
a top to play with.'' 

"Especially those big ones," 
said Vickers. "The ones with the 
handle on them and you pumped 
them on the floor and they 
whistled." 

"Sat and played with it for 
hours when I was a kid." 

"Watching where the stripes 
went?" 

"I don't recall I worried much 
about where the stripes might go. 



I just sat and watched it spin 
and listened to it whistle." 

"I used to worry about where 
they went. You know how it is. 
They travel up and then they disappear, somewhere near the top." 

"Tell me," said the manager, 
"where do they go?" 

"I don't know," Vickers admitted. 

"There's another dime store 
down the street a block or two. 
Carries a lot of junky stuff, but 
they might have a top like that 
left over." 

"Thanks," said Vickers. 

"You could also try the hardware store across the street. They 
carry quite a stock of toys, but 
I suppose they got them put 
away down in the basement. They 
only get them out at Christmas 
time." 

The man at the hardware store 
knew what Vickers wanted, but 
he didn't have one. The other 
dime store didn't either. No, said 
the girl, chewing gum and thrusting a pencil back and forth into 
the wad of hair above her ear, she 
didn't know where he might get 
one. There were a lot of other 
things here if he wanted to get 
something for a little boy. Like 
those toy rockets or these — 

He went out on the sidewalk, 
watching the late afternoon crowd 
of shoppers in the little Midwestern town. There were women in 
print dresses and other women 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



57 



in sleek business suits and there 
were high school kids just out of 
class and businessmen out for a 
cup of coffee. He saw a crowd 
of loafers gathered around his 
Forever car, parked in front of 
the first dime store. It was time, 
he thought, to feed that parking 
meter. 

He reached into his pocket. The 
coins made him wonder about 
the money in his billfold, so he 
took it out and flipped it open 
and saw that all he had .left 
were two dollar bills. 

Since he couldn't go back to 
Cliffwood, he had no place to 
call his home. He'd need money 
for lodging for the night and for 
meals and for gasoline — but more 
than that, more than anything, he 
was Ifi need of a singing top that 
had colored stripes painted on its 
belly. 

"IflCKERS stood in the middle 
* of the sidewalk, thinking 
about the top. It had worked 
once before, when he was a child, 
before Pa had taken the top away 
from him. 

What would have happened to 
him if it had not been hidden 
away? He wondered if he would 
have gone again and again, once 
he had found the way, back into 
that fairyland and what might 
have happened there, whom and 
what he might have met and what 
he would have found in the house 



hidden in the grove. For he eventually would have gone to the 
house. Having watched it long 
enough to grow accustomed to 
it, he would have followed the 
path across the grove and gone 
up to the door and knocked. 

He wondered if anyone else had 
ever watched a spinning top and 
walked into fairyland. And he 
wondered, if they had, what had 
happened to them. 

The dime store manager had 
not done it. He had never wondered where the stripes might 
go. He had just sat and watched 
and listened to the whistle. 

Vickers wondered what he was. 
that he should have found the 
way. And he wondered if the enchanted valley might not have 
been a part of fairyland as well 
and if somehow the girl and he 
might not have walked through 
another unseen gate. For surely 
the valley that he remembered 
was not the valley he had walked 
that morning. 

A top, he thought. Somewhere, 
someplace, somehow, I must find 
a top. 

But, of course, he had a top. 
The handle of it would have to 
be straightened and it might need 
a bit of oil to clear away the 
rust and it would have to be 
painted. 

More than likely it would be 
better than any other he could 
get, for it would be the original 



58 




 



top — and it pleased him to think 
that it might have certain special 
qualities, a certain mystic function no other top might have. 

He was glad that he had 
thought of it, lying there, forgotten for the second time, in 
the glove compartment where he 
had tossed it after finding it 
again. 

He walked up the street to the 
hardware store. 

"I want some paint," said Vickers. "The brightest, glossiest paint 
you have. Red and green and 
yellow. And some little brushes 
to put it on with." 

XXII 

HE called Ann from his hotel 
room, collect, since, after 
eating dinner, he had only ninety 
cents. 

She sounded harried. "Where 
in the name of heaven did you 
go?" 

He told her where he was. 

"But why are you there?" she 
asked him. "What is the matter 
with you?" 

"There's nothing wrong with 
me," said Vickers. "That is, nothing yet. I am just a fugitive." 

"You are what?" 

"I got run out of Cliff wood. 
They were fixing up a necktie 
party. Somehow or other they 
got it into their heads that I had 
killed a man." 



"Now I know you're crazy. 
You wouldn't kill a fly." 

"But I couldn't explain that to 
them. I didn't have a chance." 

"Why," said Ann, "I talked to 
Eb . . ." 

"You talked to who?" 

"You know, the man in the 
garage. For two whole days I beat 
the bushes for you. I called your 
home and there was no one there, 
so I remembered you talking 
about Eb, the garageman, and I 
asked the operator to let me talk 
to him." 

"What did Eb say?" 

"He said he hadn't noticed you 
around, but he didn't know where 
you were. He told me not to 
worry." 

"Eb was the one who tipped 
me off," said Vickers. "He gave 
me a car and some money and 
saw me out of town." 

"Of all the silly things. Who 
was it they thought you killed?" 

"Horton Flanders. He's the old 
man that got lost." 

"But you wouldn't kill him. 
You said he was a nice old man. 
You told me so yourself." 

"Look, Ann," said Vickers, "I 
didn't kill anyone. Someone just 
got the boys stirred up." 

"But you can't go back to 
Cliff wood." 

"No, I can't." 

"What will you do, Jay?" 

"I don't know. Just stay hid 
out, I guess." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



59 



C?TF7"HY didn't you call me 
right away?" demanded 
Ann. "What are you way out 
West for? You should have come 
straight to New York. New York 
is the swellest place there, is for 
someone to hide out. You might 
at least have called me." 

"Now wait a minute," Vickers 
said. "I called you, didn't I?" 

"Sure. You called me because 
you're broke and want me to wire 
some money and you — " 

"I haven't asked for any money 
yet." 

"You will." 

"Yes," he said, "I'm afraid I 
will." 

"Aren't you interested in why 
I was trying to get hold of you?" 

"Mildly," said Vickers. "Because ^ou don't want me to get 
out from under your thumb. No 
agent wants their best author to 
get from under — " 

"Some day I'm going to crucify 
you and hang you up along the 
roadside as a warning." 

"I would make a most pathetic 
Christ. You couldn't choose a 
better man. All right, why did 
you want me?" 

"Because Crawford's practically frantic. He won't quibble. I 
mentioned a fantastic figure and 
he didn't even shiver." 

"I thought we disposed of Mr. 
Crawford," Vickers said. 

"You don't dispose of Crawford." Her voice was quiet but 



strained. "Crawford is a badly 
frightened man. He came to me. 
Imagine that! He came into my 
office, puffing and panting, and 
I was afraid I didn't have a 
chair in the place strong enough. 
But you remember that old oak 
one over in the corner? It was 
one of the first sticks of furniture 
I ever bought for my office and 
I kept it as a sentimental piece. 
Well, it did the trick." 
"What trick?" 

"It held him," said Ann, triumphantly. "He'd have simply 
crushed anything else in the 
place. You remember what a big 
man he is." 

"Gross," Said Vickers. "That's 
the word you want." 

"He said, 'Where's Vickers?' 
And I said, 'Why ask me? I don't 
keep a leash on Vickers.' And 
he says, 'You're his agent, aren't 
you?' And I said, 'Yes, the last 
time I heard, but Vickers is a 
very changeable sort of man. 
There's no telling about him.' 
He says he's got to have Vickers. 
And so I said, 'Well, go get him. 
You'll find him around somewhere.' He said, 'The sky's the 
limit. Name any price, make any 
terms you want.* " 

"The man's a crackpot," Vickers said. 

"There's nothing crackpot about 
the kind of money he's offering." 

"How do you know he's got 
the money?" 



60 




 



"Well, I don't know. Not for 
sure, that is. But he must have." 

"Speaking of money," Vickers 
said, "have you got a loose hundred lying around? Or fifty, 
even?" 

"I can get it." 

"Wire it here. I'll pay you 
back." 

"All right," she said. "It isn't 
the first time I've bailed you out 
and I don't imagine it will be 
the last. But will you tell me 
one thing?" 

"What's that?" 

"What are you going to do?" 

"As soon as I get through talking to you," said Vickers, "I'm 
going to do some painting." 

"A house?" 

"No, a top." 

"The top of what?" 

"Not the top of anything. A 
top. A toy kids play with. You 
spin it on the floor." 

"Now listen to me," she said. 
"You cut out this playing around 
and come home to Ann." 

"After the experiment," said 
Vickers. 

"Tell me about it, Jay." 

"I'm going to try to get into 
fairyland." 

"Quit talking foolish." 

"I did it once before. No, 
twice." 

"Listen, Jay. This business is 
serious. Crawford is scared and 
so am I. And there's this lynching threat, too. There's no time 



for kidding or playing games," 
"Send me the money," Vickers 

said. 

"Right away." 

"I'll see you in a day or two." 

"Call me tomorrow. Take care 
of yourself. I don't know what 
you're up to, but take care of 
yourself." 

"I'll do both," Vickers promised. "Take care of myself and 
call you tomorrow." 

"I'll kill you if you don't." * 

"Ann," he said unhappily, "you 
could choose your colloquialisms 
a little more tactfully." 

XXIII 

TIE straightened the handle 
which spun the top and he 
polished the metal before marking off the spirals with a pencil 
and he borrowed a can of sewing 
machine oil and oiled up the 
spinning spiral on the handle so 
that it worked smoothly. Then 
he went about the painting. 

He got paint on his hands and 
on his clothes and on the chair 
he laid the top on and he spilled 
the can of red paint on the floor, 
but he picked it up so quickly 
that scarcely any of it ran out 
onto the carpeting. 

Finally the job was finished 
and it looked fairly good. 

He worried whether it would 
be dry by morning, but he read 
the labels on the cans and the la


RING AROUND THE SUN

bels said the paint was quick drying, so he was somewhat relieved. 

He was ready now, ready to see 
what he would find when he spun 
the top. It might be fairyland 
and it might be nothing. Most 
likely it would be nothing, for 
more would go into it than the 
spinning of the top- — The mind 
and the faith and the pure simplicity of a child. And he didn't 
have that any longer. 

He went out and closed and 
locked the door behind hjm, then 
went down the stairs. The town 
and the hotel were too small to 
have elevators. Although not so 
small a town as the little village 
that had been "town" to him in 
fiis childhood days, that little village where they still sat out on 
the bench in front of the store 
and Tooked up at you with sidewise glances and asked you impudent, prying questions out of 
which to weave the fabric of long 
gossiping. 

He chuckled, thinking of what 
they'd say when the word got 
back of how he had fled from 
Cliffwood on the threat of being 
lynched. 

"He always was a sly one and 
not up to any good," they would 
say. "His Ma and Pa were real 
good people, though. Beats hell 
how a son sometimes turns out 
no matter if his Ma and Pa were 
honest people." 

He went through the lobby and 



out the door and stood out on the 
street. 

Maybe, he thought, he should 
have told Ann that it had been 
Crawford who had stirred up the 
boys in Cliffwood. Not Crawford 
himself, perhaps, but some of 
Crawford's henchmen. 

But maybe it was just as well 
that he hadn't told Ann. There 
was no use worrying her, and if 
he'd told her, she'd have wanted 
to know how he knew it had 
been Crawford and why had 
Crawford done it. And, of course, 
he couldn't tell her that. 

AT a diner, Vickers ordered a 
cup of coffee and the waitress said to him, "Nice night, isn't 
it?" 

"Yes, it is," he said. 

"You want anything to go 
with that coffee, mister?" 

"No," said Vickers. "Just the 
coffee." 

She moved on up the counter 
and wiped off imaginary spots 
with a cloth she carried in her 
hand. 

A top, he thought. Where did it 
tie in? He'd take the top to 
the house and spin it and would 
know once and for all if there 
were a fairyland — well, no, the 
flower in winter had been proof of 
that. He'd know if he could get 
back into fairyland. 

And the house. Where did the 
house tie in? 



62 




 



Or did either the house or the 
top tie in? 

And if they didn't tie in, why 
had Horton Fl anders written : 
"Go back and travel the paths 
you walked in childhood. Maybe 
there you will find a thing you'll 
need — or something that is missing." He wished he could remember the exact words Flanders 
had used, but he could not. 

So he had come back and he 
had found a top and, more than 
that, he had remembered fairyland. And why, he asked himself, 
in all the years since he had 
been eight, had he never recalled 
that enchanted visit? 

It had made a deep impression 
on him at the time, of that there 
was no doubt, for once he remembered it, it had been as clear and 
sharp as if it had just happened. 

But something had made him 
forget it, some mental block, perhaps. And something had made 
him know that the metal mouse 
had wanted to be trapped. And 
something had made him instinctively refuse Crawford's proposition. 

Strange dog, he said. You're a 
strange dog, Vickers. 

The waitress came back down 
the counter and leaned on her 
elbow. 

"You like pictures, mister?" 
asked the girl. 

"1 don't know," said Vickers. 
"I seldom go to them." 



Her face said she sympathized 
with anyone who didn't. "I just 
live for them," she said. 

He looked up at her and saw 
she wore the face of Everyone. It 
was the face of the two women 
who talked in the seat behind him 
on the bus; it was the face of 
Mrs. Leslie, saying to him, "Some 
of us are going to organize a 
Pretentionist club . . ." And, yes, 
it was the face of Mrs. Leslie's 
husband, crowding drink and 
women into a barren life. It was 
the face of grinding anxiety that 
had become commonplace, that 
sent people fleeing for psychological shelters against the bombs of 
uncertainty. 

Cynicism had run out and 
flippancy had never been more 
than a temporary shield. So now 
the people fled to the drug of pretense, identifying themselves with 
another life and another time and 
place — at the movie theater or 
on the television screen or in the 
Pretentionist movement. For so 
long as you were someone else, 
you need not be yourself, vulnerable and afraid. 

He finished his coffee and went 
out. 

Overhead, a jet plane flashed 
past, streaking low, the snarl of 
its tubes bouncing back against 
the walls. He watched its lights 
draw twin lines of fire over the 
night horizon, and then went for 
a walk.

"W/HEN Vickers opened the 
door of his room, he saw 
thaj the top was gone. He had 
left it on the chair, gaudy in its 
new paint, and it wasn't on the 
chair or on the floor. He got 
down on his belly and looked 
underneath the bed and it wasn't 
there. Nor was it in the closet and 
or in the hall outside. 

He came back into the room 
again and sat down on the edge 
of the bed. 

After all his worry and planning, the top had disappeared. 
Who would have stolen it? What 
would anyone want with a battered top? 

What had he himself wanted 
with it? 

It seemed faintly ridiculous 



64 



G 



now, sitting on the edge of the 
bed in a strange hotel room, to 
ask himself these questions. 

He had thought the top would 
buy his way into fairyland and 
now, in the white glare of the 
ceiling light, he wondered at himself for the madness of his antics. 

Behind him, the door came 
open and he heard it and turned 
around sharply. 

In the door stood Crawford, 
even more massive than Vickers 
had remembered him. He filled 
the doorway and he stood motionless, without a single flicker 
except for the eyelids. 

Crawford said, "Good evening, 
Mr. Vickers. Won't you ask me 
to come in?" 

"Certainly," said Vickers. "I 
was waiting for a call from you. 
I never thought you would take 



the trouble to travel here in 
person." 

And that was a lie, of course, 
because he'd not been waiting 
for a call. 

Crawford moved ponderously 
across the room. "This chair looks 
strong enough to hold me. You 
don't mind, I hope." 

"It's not my chair. Go ahead 
and bust it." 

It creaked and groaned, but it 
held. 

Crawford relaxed and sighed. 
"I always feel so much better 
when I get a good strong chair 
beneath me." 

"You tapped Ann's phone," 
said Vickers. 

"Why, certainly. How else 
would I have found you? I knew 
that, sooner or later, you would 
call her." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



65 



"I saw the plane come in. If 
I had known it was you, I'd have 
driven out to meet you." 

Crawford chuckled. "I'll bet." 

"Damned right I would. I have 
a bone to pick with you." 

"I don't doubt it," Crawford 
said. "Which in particular?" 

"Why did you almost get me 
lynched?" 

"I wouldn't have you lynched," 
said Crawford. "I'm too much in 
need of you." 

"What for?" 

"I don't know. I thought maybe you would know." 

"Crawford, what is this all 
about? You didn't tell me the 
truth that day I came in to see 
you." 

"I told you the truth, or at 
least part of it. I couldn't tell 
you everything we knew." 

"Why not?" 

"I didn't know who you were." 
"But you seem to know now." 

WV"ES. I do," said Crawford. 
"You are one of them." 

"One of whom?" 

"One of the gadgeteers." 

"What in hell makes you think 
so?" 

"Analyzers. That's what the 
psycli boys call them. We had 
analyzers in your house. The 
damn things are uncanny. I don't 
pretend to understand them." 

"And the analyzers said I was 
a strange dog." 



"Translate, please," said Crawford, puzzled. 

"You know how a strange dog 
is. The other dogs all come out 
to meet it and they sniff it over 
and circle around and growl a 
bit and take an experimental nip 
or two. And all the time the 
strange dog stands there, stiff and 
still, not moving at all, waiting 
for the other dogs to pass inspection on it." 

"I see. Yes, I guess we sniffed 
you some." 

"I warn you, Crawford. I won't 
stand still. I won't let you take 
any nips." 

"I'm not nipping at you." 

"Not yet," said Vickers. "If I 
am one of them, you are fighting 
me. A world with its back against 
the wall. Remember." 

"Don't say 'if.' You are one of 
them, but quit acting as if I were 
an enemy." 

"If I am what you say I am, 
you are an enemy." 

"You don't understand," said 
Crawford. "Let's try analogy. 
Let's go back to the day when 
the Cro-Magnon drifted into 
Neanderthaler territory . . ." 

"Don't give me analogy," Vickers told him. "Tell me what is on 
your mind." 

"I just plain don't like the 
situation." 

"You forget that I don't know 
what the situation is." 

"That's what I was trying to 



66 




 



tell you with my analogy. You 
are the Cro-Magnon. You have 
the bow and arrow and the spear. 
I am the Neanderthaler. I only 
have a club. You have clothing 
fashioned out of hides and furs 
and I have nothing but the hair 
I stand in." 

"I wouldn't know," said Vickers. 

"I'm not so sure myself," Crawford admitted. "I'm not up on 
that sort of stuff. Maybe I gave 
the Cro-Magnon a bit too much 
and the Neanderthaler a bit too 
little. But that's not the point 
at all." 

"I get the point. Where do we 
go from there?" 

"T"You're trying to make me see 
how deep the cleavage goes." 

''That is what I'm doing," 
Crawford told him. "You can't 
realize the depth of hate, the 
margin of intelligence and ability. 
Nor can you realize how desperate we really are. 

"Who are these desperate men? 
I'll tell you. They're the successful ones, the industrialists, the 
bankers, the businessmen, the 
professional men, those who have 
security and hold positions of 
importance, who move in social 
circles which mark the high tide 
of our culture. 

"They'd no longer hold their 
positions if your kind of men took 
over. They'd be Neanderthaler to 
your Cro-Magnon. They'd survive physically, but they'd be 
aboriginees. Their values would 
be swept away and those values, 
built up painfully, are all they 
have to live by." 

Vickers shook his head. "I 
suppose I should pretend I know 
as much as you think I do — act 
smart and make you believe I 
know all there is to know. Fence 
with you. Get you to tip your 
hand. I'd rather be honest and 
say it's all Greek to me." 

"I know it is. That's why I 
wanted to reach you as soon as 
possible. You haven't yet shed the 
chrysalis of an ordinary man. 
The tendency is to shift toward 
mutation — more today than yes


terday, more tomorrow than today. But tonight, in this room, 
you and I still can talk man to 
man." 

"We could always talk." 

"No, we couldn't," Crawford 
dissented. "If you were entirely 
mutant, I'd feel the difference in 
us. Without equality I'd doubt 
the soundness of my logic. As it 
is, you're doubting yours, which 
gives me an advantage. I won't 
have that advantage when you 
finish mutating."* 

"Just before you came in," said 
Vickers, "I'd almost convinced 
myself it was all imagination . . ." 

"It's not imagination, Vickers. 
You had a top, remember?" 

"The top is gone." 

"Not gone," said Crawford. 

"You have it?" 

"No, I haven't. I don't know 
where it is, but it still is somewhere in this room. You see, I got 
here before you did and I picked 
the lock. Incidentally, a very 
inefficient lock." 

"Incidentally," said Vickers, "a 
very sneaky trick." 

"Granted. And before this is 
over, I'll commit other sneaky 
tricks. But to go back. I picked 
the lock and walked into the 
room and I saw the top and wondered and I — well, I — " 

"Go on." 

"Look, Vickers, I had a top 
like that when I was a kid. Long, 
long ago. So I picked it up and 
spun it. For no reason. Well, yes, 
there may have been a reason. 
Maybe an attempt to regain a 
lost moment of my childhood. 
And the top . . 

He stopped speaking and stared 
hard at Vickers, as if he might 
be trying to detect some sign of 
laughter. When he spoke again, 
his voice was almost casual. 

"The top disappeared." 

VICKERS said nothing. 
"What was it?" Crawford 
asked. "What kind of top was 
that?" 

"I don't know. Were you 
watching it when it disappeared?" 

"No. I thought I heard someone in the hall. I took a fast 



glance. It was gone when I looked 
baclf." 

"It shouldn't have disappeared," said Vickers. "Not without you watching it." 

"There was some reason for 
the top. You had painted it. You 
wouldn't go to all that trouble 
without some purpose. What was 
the top for, Vickers?" 

"To go into fairyland." 

"You're talking riddles," snapped Crawford irritably. 

"I went — physically — when I 
was a kid." 

"Ten days ago, I would have 
said both of us were crazy, you 
for saying it and I for believing 
it. I can't say it now." 

"We still may be crazy, or, at 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



69 



best, just a pair of fools." 

"We're neither fools nor crazy," 
Crawford said. "We are men, the 
two of us, not quite the same 
and more different by the hour, 
but we still are men and not 
crazy or fools." 

"Why did you come here, 
Crawford? Don't tell me just to 
talk. You're too anxious. You 
had a tap on Ann's phone to find 
out where I'd gone. You sneaked 
into my room and you spun the 
top. All right, why?" 

"I came here to warn you that 
the men I represent are desperate, 
that they will stop at nothing. 
They won't be taken over." 

"And if they have no choice?" 

"They have a choice. They can 
fight with what they have." 

"The Neanderthalers fought 
with clubs." 

"So will Homo sapiens. Clubs 
against your arrows. That's why 
I want to talk to you. There must 
be some area for agreement." 

"Ten days ago," said Vickers, 
"I sat in your office and talked 
*with you. You described the situation and you said you were 
mystified and stumped. To hear 
you tell it then, you didn't have 
the ghost of an idea what was 
going on. Why did you He to 
me?" 

CRAWFORD sat stolidly, unmoving, no change of expression on his fare. "We had the 



machine on you, remember? The 
analyzers. We wanted to find out 
how much you knew." 

"How much did I know?" 

"Not a thing. All we found 
out was that you were a latent 
mutant." 

"Then why pick me out?" demanded Vickers. "Except for 
what you tell me, I have no reason to believe that I am a mutant. 
I know no mutants. I can't speak 
for mutants. If you want to make 
a deal, go catch yourself a real, 
honest-to-God mutant." 

"We picked you out," said 
Crawford, "for a simple reason. 
You are the only mutant we 
could lay a finger on. You and 
one other — and the other is even 
less aware than you." 

"But you think there are more." 

"We know there are. But we 
can't catch them. You can pin 
them down only when they want 
to see you. Otherwise they are always out." 

"Out?" 

"They disappear," explained 
Crawford harshly. "We track 
them down and wait. We send in 
word and wait. We ring doorbells 
and wait. We never find them in. 
They go in a door, but they aren't 
in the room. We wait for hours to 
see them and then find out they 
weren't in the place where we'd 
seen them go at all, but somewhere else, maybe miles away." 

"But me — me you can track 



70 




 



down. I don't disappear." 
"Not yet." 

"Maybe I'm a moronic mutant." 

"An undeveloped one." 

"You picked me out," said 
Vickers. "In the first place, I 
mean. You had some reason to 
suspect before I knew." 

Crawford chuckled. ' 'Your 
writing. Our psych department 
spotted it. We found some others 
that way. A couple of artists, an 
architect, a sculptor, one or two 
scientists. Don't look so startled, 
Vickers. When you organize 
world industry, you have, in 
terms of cash and manpower, a 
crack outfit that can perform tremendous jobs of research — or 
anything else that you put it to. 
You'd be surprised how much 
work we've done, the areas we 
have covered. But it's not enough. 
I don't mind telling you that 
we've been licked at every turn." 

"So now you want to bargain." 

"I do. Not the others. They're 
fighting for the world they've 
built through many bloody 
years." 

AND that was it, thought 
Vickers. Through many 
bloody years. 

Horton Flanders had sat on the 
porch and talked of war and why 
World War III somehow hadn't 
happened and he had said that 
maybe someone or something had 



stepped in, time and again, to 
prevent it from happening. Intervention, he had said, rocking back 
and forth. 

"This world they built," Vickers pointed out, "hasn't been too 
good a world. It was built with 
much blood and misery; it mixed 
too many bones into the mortar. 
During all its history, there's 
hardly been a year when there 
wasn't violence somewhere on 
Earth." 

"I know what you mean," said 
Crawford. "You think there 
should be a reorganization." 

"Something like that." 

"Let's do some figuring then," 
Crawford invited. "Let's try to 
thrash it out." 

"I can't. I have no knowledge 
and I have no authority. I haven't 
even contacted or been contacted 
by these mutants of yours — if 
they are really mutants." 

"The analyzer says they are 
mutants. It said you are." 

"How can you be sure?" asked 
Vickers. 

"You don't trust me. You think 
I'm a renegade, that I see sure 
defeat ahead and have come running, waving the white flag, anxious to make my individual peace 
and to hell with all the rest of 
them, that maybe the mutants 
will keep me as a mascot or a 
pet." 

"If what you say is true, you 
and the rest of them are licked, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



71 



no matter what you do." 

"Not entirely licked," said 
Crawford. "We can hit back. We 
can raise a lot of hell." 

"With what? You only have a 
club." 

"We have desperation." 
"Aclub and desperation? That's 
all?" 

"We have a secret weapon." 
"And the others want to use 
it." 

Crawford nodded. "But it isn't 
good enough, which is why I'm 
here." 

"I'll get in touch with you," 
said Vickers. "That's the best 
that I can do. When and if I find 
you're right, I'll get in touch with 
you." 

CRAWFORD heaved himself 
out*of the chair. "Make it 
quick as possible. I can't hold 
them off long." 

"You're scared," said Vickers. 
"You were frightened the first 
day I saw you and you still are." 

"I've been scared ever since it 
started. It gets worse every day." 
"Two frightened men." 



"You, too?" 

"Of course. Can't you see me 
shaking?" 

"No, I can't. In some ways, 
Vickers, you're the most coldblooded man I have ever met." 

"One thing," said Vickers. 
"You said there was another mutant you could catch." 

"Yes, I told you that." 

"Any chance of knowing who?" 

"Not a chance," said Crawford. 

"I didn't think there was." 

The rug seemed to blur a little, 
then the top was there, spinning 
slowly, its hum choked off, its 
colors blotched with its erratic 
wobbling. 

They stood and watched it until it stopped and lay upon the 
floor. 

"It went away," said Crawford. 

"And now it's back," Vickers 
whispered. 

Crawford shut the door behind 
him. Vickers stood in the cold, 
bright room with the motionless 
top on the floor, listening to 
Crawford's footsteps going down 
the hall. 
HE Neanderthaler fought back," said Crawford, "and 
what happened to him?" 

"He became extinct." 

"They may have died for 
many reasons besides the spear 
and arrow. Perhaps they were 
squeezed out of their hunting 
grounds. Perhaps they died of 
shame — the knowledge that they 
were outdated, that they were, by 
comparison, little more than 
beasts." 

"I doubt," said Vickers, "that 
a Neanderthaler could work up a 
very powerful inferiority complex." 

"The suggestion may not apply 
to the Neanderthaler. It does 
apply to us."
