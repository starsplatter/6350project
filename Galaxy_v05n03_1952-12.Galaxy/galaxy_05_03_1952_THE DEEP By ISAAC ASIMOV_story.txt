THE DEEP By ISAAC ASIMOV 

IN the end, any particular 
planet must die. It may be 
a quick death as its sun explodes. It may be a slow death 
as its sun sinks into decay and 
its oceans lock in ice. In the 
latter case, at least, intelligent life 
has a chance of survival. 

The direction of survival may 
be outward into space, to a planet 



closer to the cooling sun, or to a 
planet of another sun altogether. 
This particular avenue is closed if 
the planet is unfortunate enough 
to be the only habitable one rotating about its primary and if, 
at the time, no other star is within 
half a thousand light-years. 

The direction of survival may 
be inward, into the crust of the 
planet. That is always available. 
A new home can be built underground and the heat of the 
planet's core can be tapped for 
energy. Thousands of years may 
be necessary for the task, but a 
dying sun cools slowly. 

Yet planetary warmth dies, 
too, with time. Burrows must be 
dug deeper and deeper until the 
planet is dead through and 
through. 

The time was coming. 

On the surface of the planet, 
wisps of neon blew listlessly, barely able to stir the pools of oxygen 
that collected in the lowlands. 
Occasionally, during the long day, 
the crusted sun would flare briefly 
into a dull red glow and the 
oxygen pools would bubble a 
little. 

During the long night, a bluewhite oxygen frost formed over 
the pools and on the bare rock, 
a neon dew formed. 

Eight hundred miles below the 
surface, a last bubble of warmth 
and life existed.

W^ENDA'S relationship to Roi 
was as close as one could 
imagine, closer by far than it was 
decent for her to know. 

She had been allowed to enter 
the ovarium only once in her 
life and it had been made quite 
clear to her that it was to be 



only that once. 

The Raceologist had said, "You 
don't quite meet the standards, 
Wenda, but you are fertile and 
that may be enough. We'll try 
you and see." 

She wanted it to work out. 
She wanted it desperately. Quite 
early in her life, she had known 
that she was deficient in intelligence, that she would never be 
more than a Manual. It embarrassed her that she should fail 
the Race and she longed for even 
a single chance to help create 
another being. It became an obsession. 

She secreted her egg in an angle 
of the structure and then returned 
to watch. The "randoming" process that moved the eggs gently 
about during mechanical insemination (to insure even gene-distribution) did not. by some good 
fortune, do more than make her 
own wedged-in egg wobble a bit. 

Unobtrusively, she maintained 
her watch during the period of 
maturation, observed the little 
one that emerged from the particular egg that was hers, noted 
his physical markings, watched 
him grow. 

He was a healthy youngster 
and the Raceologist approved of 
him. 

She had said once, very casually, "Look at that one, the one 
sitting there. Is he sick?" 

"Which one?" The Raceologist 



140 




 



was startled. Visibly sick infants 
at this stage would be a strong 
reflection upon his own competence. "You mean Roi? Nonsense. 
I wish all our young were like 
him." 

At first, she was only pleased 
with herself, then frightened, 
finally horrified as she found herself haunting the youngster while 
he grew, taking an interest in 
his schooling, watching him at 
play. She was happy when he 
was near, dull and unhappy 
otherwise. She had never heard of 
such a thing, and she was 
ashamed. 

SHE should have visited the 
Mentalist, but she knew better. She was not so dull that she 
didn't know this was not a mild 
aberration to be cured at the 
twitch of a brain cell. It was a 
truly psychotic manifestation. 
She was certain of that. They 
would confine her if they found 
out. They would euthanase her, 
perhaps, as a useless drain on the 
strictly limited energy available 
to the Race. They might even 
euthanese the offspring of her 
egg, if they found out who it was. 
* She fought the abnormality 
through the years and, to a measure, succeeded. Then she first 
heard the news that Roi had been 
chosen for the long trip, and she 
once again was filled with aching 
misery. 



SHE followed him to one of the 
empty corridors of the cavern, 
some miles from the city center. 
The city — there was only one. 

This particular cavern had been 
closed down within Wenda's own 
memory. The Elders had paced 
its length, considered its population and the energy necessary to 
keep it powered, then decided to 
darken it. The population — not 
many, to be sure — had been 
moved closer toward the center, 
and the quota for the next 
session at the Ovarium had been 
cut. 

Wenda found Roi's conversational level of thinking shallow, 
as though most of his mind had 
drawn inward contemplatively. 

"Are you afraid?" she thought 
at him. 

"Because I come out here to 
ponder?" He hesitated a little, 
then admitted. "Yes, I am. It's 
the Race's last chance. If I fail — " 

"Are you afraid for yourself?" 

He looked at her in astonishment and Wenda's thought stream fluttered with shame at 
her indecency. 

She said, "I wish I were going 
instead." 

"Do you think you can do a 
better job?" 

"Oh, no. But if / were to fail 
and — and never come back, it 
would be a smaller loss to the 
Race." 

"The loss is exactly the same," 



THE DEEP 



141 



he said, stolidly, "whether it's 
you or I. The toss is Racial existence." 

Racial existence at the moment 
was in the background of Wenda's 
mind, if anywhere. 

She sighed. "The trip is such 
a long one." 

"How long?" he asked with a 
smile. "Do you know?" 

She hesitated. She dared not 
appear stupid to him. 

She said, primly. "The common talk is that it is to the First 
Level." 

When Wenda had been little 
and the heated corridors had extended farther out of the City, 
she had wandered out, exploring, 
as youngsters will. One day, a 
long distance out, where the chill 
in the air nipped at her, she 
came*to a hall that slanted upward, but was blocked almost 
instantly by a tremendous plug, 
wedged tightly from top to bottom and side to side. 

On the other side and upward, 
she had learned a long time later, 
lay the Seventy-ninth Level, 
above that the Seventy-eighth, 
and so on. 

"We're going past the First 
Level, Wenda." 

"But there's nothing beyond 
that!" she protested. 

"You're right. Nothing. All the 
solid matter of the planet comes 
to an end." 

"But how can there be any


thing that's nothing? You mean 
air?" 

"No, I mean nothing. Vacuum. 
You know what vacuum is, don't 
you?" 

"Yes. But vacuums have to be 
pumped and kept airtight." 

"That's good reasoning for a 
Manual. Still, past the First Level 
there is just an indefinite amount 
of vacuum stretching everywhere." 

Wenda thought a while. She 
said, "Has anyone ever been 
there?" 

"Naturally not. But we have 
the records." 

"Maybe the records are wrong." 

"They can't be. Do you know 
how much space I'm going to 
cross?" 

Wenda's thought -stream indicated an overwhelming negative. 

Roi said, "You know the speed 
of light, I suppose ?" 

"Of course," she replied, readily. It was a universal constant 
that even Infants knew. "One 
thousand nine hundred and fiftyfour times the length of the cavern and back in one second." 

"Right," said Roi. "but if light 
were to travel along the distance 
I'm to cross, it would take it ten 
years." 

" Wenda said, "You're making 
fun of me. You're trying to frighten me." 

"Why should it frighten you?" 
He rose. "Well, I've been moping 



142 




 



here long enough — " 

For a moment, one of his six 
grasping limbs rested lightly in 
one of hers, with an objective, 
impassive friendship. An irrational impulse urged Wenda to 
seize it tightly, prevent him from 
leaving. 

She panicked for a moment in 
fear that he might probe her mind 
past the conversational level, that 
he might sicken and never face 
her again, that he might even 
report her for treatment. Then 
she relaxed. Roi was normal, not 
sick like herself. He would never 
dream of penetrating a friend's 
mind any deeper than the conversational level, whatever the 
provocation. 

He was very handsome in her 
eyes as he walked away, His 
grasping limbs were straight and 
strong, his prehensile, manipulative vibrissae were numerous and 
delicate, and his optic patches 
were more beautifully opalescent 
than any she had ever seen. 

II 

T AURA settled down in her 
seat. How soft and comfortable they made them ! How 
pleasing and unfrightening airplanes were on the inside, so 
different from the hard, silvery, 
inhuman luster of the outside! 

The bassinet was on the seat 
beside her. She peeped in past 



the blanket and the tiny, ruffled 
cap. Walter was sleeping. His face 
was the blank, round softness of 
infancy and his eyelids, were two 
fringed half-moons pulled down 
over his eyes. 

A tuft of light brown hair 
straggled across his forehead and, 
with infinite delicacy, Laura 
drew it back beneath his cap. 

It would soon be Walter's feeding time and she hoped he was 
still too young to be upset by 
the strangeness of his surroundings. The stewardess was being 
very kind. She even kept his 
bottles in a little refrigerator. 
Imagine, a refrigerator on board 
an airplane! 

The people in the seat across 
the aisle had been watching her 
in that peculiar way that meant 
they would love to talk to her if 
only they could think of an excuse. The moment came when she 
lifted Walter out of his bassinet 
and placed him, a little lump of 
pink flesh encased in a white 
cocoon of cotton, upon her lap. 

A baby is always legitimate as 
an opening for conversation between strangers. 

The lady across the way said 
(her words were predictable) , 
"What a lovely child. How old 
is he, my dear?" 

Laura said, through the pins in 
her mouth (she had spread a 
blanket across her knees and was 
changing Walter), "He'll be -four 



THE DEEP 



143 



months old next week." 

Walter's eyes were open and 
he simpered across at the woman, 
opening his mouth in a wet, 
gummy grin. (He always enjoyed 
being changed.) 

"Look at him smile, George," 
said the lady. 

Her husband smiled back and 
twiddled fat fingers. 

"Goo," he said. 

Walter laughed in a highpitched hiccupy way. 

"What's his name, dear?" 
asked the woman. 

"He's Walter Michael," Laura 
said, then added, "After his 
father." 

The floodgates were now down. 
Laura learned that the couple 
were George and Eleanor Ellis, 
that they were on their vacation, 
that They had three children, two 
girls and one boy, all grown up. 
Both girls had married and one 
had two children of her own. 

Laura listened with a pleased 
expression on her thin face. 
Walter (senior, that is) had always said that it was because 
she was such a good listener 
that he had first grown interested 
in her. 

WALTER was getting restless. 
Laura freed his arms in 
order to let some of his feelings 
evaporate in muscular effort. 

"Would you warm the bottle, 
please?" she asked the stewardess. 



Under strict but friendly questioning, Laura explained the number of feedings Walter was currently enjoying, the exact nature 
of his formula, and whether he 
suffered from diaper rash. 

"I hope his little stomach isn't 
upset today ," she worried . ' ' I 
mean the plane motion, you 
know." 

"Oh, Lord," said Mrs. Ellis, 
"he's too young to be bothered 
by that. Besides, these large 
planes are wonderful. Unless I 
look out the window, I wouldn't 
believe we were in the air. Don't 
you feel that way, George?" 

But Mr. Ellis, a blunt, straightforward man, said, "I'm surprised 
you take a baby that age on a 
plane." 

Mrs. Ellis turned to frown at 
him. 

Laura held Walter over her 
shoulder and patted his back 
gently. The beginnings of a soft 
wail died down as his little fingers 
found themselves in his mother's 
smooth, blonde hair and began 
grubbing into the loose bun that 
lay at the back of her neck. 

She said, "I'm taking him to 
his father. Walter's never seen his 
son yet." 

Mr. Ellis looked perplexed and 
began a comment, but Mrs. Ellis 
put in quickly. "Your husband 
is in the Service, I suppose?" 

"Yes, he is." 

Mr. Ellis opened his mouth in 



144 




 



a soundless "Oh" and subsided. 

Laura went on, "He's stationed 
just outside Davao and he's going 
to be meeting me at Nichols 
Field." 

Before the stewardess returned 
with the bottle, they had discovered that her husband was a master sergeant with the Quartermaster Corps, that he had been 
in the Army for four years, that 
they had been married for two, 
that he was about to be discharged, and that they would 
spend a long honeymoon in the 
Philippines before returning to 
San Francisco. 

Then she had the bottle. She 
cradled Walter in the crook of 
her left arm and put the bottle 
to his face. It slid right past his 
lips and his gums seized upon 
the nipple. Little bubbles began 
to work upward through the milk, 
while his hands batted ineffectively at the warm glass and his 
blue eyes stared fixedly up at her. 

Laura squeezed little Walter 
ever so slightly and thought how, 
with all the petty difficulties and 
annoyances that were involved, 
it yet remained such a wonderful 
thing to have a little baby all 
one's own. 

Ill 

THEORY, thought Gan, always 
theory. The folk of the surface, a million or more years 



ago, could see the Universe, could 
sense it directly. Now, with eight 
hundred miles of rock above their 
heads, the Race could only make 
deductions from the trembling 
needles of their instruments. 

It was only theory tHat brain 
cells, in addition to their ordinary electric potentials, radiated another sort of energy 
altogether. Energy that was not 
electromagnetic and hence not 
condemned to the creeping pace of 
light. Energy that was associated 
with the highest functions of the 
brain and hence characteristic 
only of intelligent, reasoning creatures. 

It was a jogging needle that 
detected such an energy field 
leaking into their cavern, and 
other needles that pinpointed the 
origin of the field in such-andsuch a direction ten light-years 
distant. At least one star must 
have moved quite close in the 
time since the surface-folk had 
placed the nearest at five hundred 
light-years. Or was theory wrong? 

"Are you afraid?" Gan burst 
into the conversational level of 
thought without warning and impinged sharply on the humming 
surface of Roi's mind. 

Roi said, "It's a great responsibility." 

Gan thought: Others speak of 
responsibility. For generations, 
Head-Tech after Head-Tech had 
been working on the Resonizer 



THE DEEP 



145 



and the Receiving Station and it 
was in his time that the final step 
had to be taken. What did others 
know of responsibility? 

He said, "It is. We talk about 
Racial extinction glibly enough, 
yet we 'always assume it will 
come some day, not now, not in 
our time. But it will, do you 
understand? It will! What we 
are to do today will consume twothirds of our total energy supply. 
.There will not be enough left 
to try again. There will net be 
enough for this generation to live 
out its life. But that will not 
matter if you follow orders. We 
have thought of everything. We 
have spent generations thinking 
of everything." 

"I will do what I am told," 
said R^oi. 

"Your thought- field will be 
meshed against those coming 
from space. All thought-fields are 
characteristic of the individual 
and ordinarily the probability of 
any duplication is very low. But 
the fields from space number 
billions according to our best 
estimate. Your field is very likely 
to resemble one of tneirs. In 
that case, a resonance will be set 
up as long as our Resonizer is 
in operation. Do you know the 
principles involved?" 

"Yes, sir." 

"Then you know that during 
resonance, your mind will be on 
Planet X in the brain of the 



creature with g thought -field 
identical to yours. That is not 
the energy-consuming process. In 
resonance with your mind we will 
also place the mass of the Receiving Station. The method of 
transferring mass in that manner 
was the last phase of the problem 
to be solved. It will take all the 
energy the Race would ordinarily 
use in a hundred years!" 

GAN picked up the black cube 
that was the Receiving Station and looked at it somberly. 
Three generations before, it had 
been thought impossible to manufacture one, with all the required 
properties, in a space less than 
twenty cubic yards. They had it 
now; it was the size of his fist. 

Gan said, "The thought-field 
of intelligent brain cells can only 
follow certain well-defined patterns. All living creatures', on 
whatever planet they develop, 
must possess a protein base and 
an oxygen- water chemistry. If 
their world is livable for them, 
it is livable for us." 

Theory, thought Gan on a 
deeper level, always theory, never 
evidence that could be checked. 
And what if the theory was 
wrong? 

He went on, "This does not 
mean that the body you find 
yourself in — its mind and its emotions — may not be completely 
alien. So we have arranged for 



146 




 



three methods of activating the 
Receiving Station. If you are 
strong-limbed, you need only exert five hundred pounds of pressure on any face of the cube. If 
you are delicate-limbed, you need 
only press a knob which you 
can reach through this single 
opening in the cube. If you are 
no-limbed, if your host body is 
paralyzed or in any other way 
helpless, you can activate the 
Station by mental energy alone. 
Once the Station is activated, we 
will have two points of reference, 
not one, and the Race can be 
transferred to Planet X by ordinary teleportation." 

"That," said Roi, "will mean 
we will use electromagnetic energy." 

"And so?" 

"It will take us ten years to 
transfer." 

"We will not be aware of 
duration." 

"I realize that, sir, but it will 
mean the Station will remain on 
Planet X for ten years. What if 
it is destroyed in the meantime?" 

"We have thought of that, too. 
We have thought of everything. 
Once the Station is activated, it 
will generate a para-mass field. 
It will move in the direction of 
gravitational attraction, sliding 
through ordinary matter, until 
such time as a continuous medium of relatively high density 
exerts sufficient friction to stop it. 



It will take twenty feet of rock as 
we know it to do that. Anything 
of lower density won't affect it. 
It will remain twenty feet underground for ten years, at which 
tims- a counter-field will bring it 
to the surface. Then the Race 
will appear." 

"In that case, why not make 
the activation of the Station automatic? It has so many automatic attributes already — " 

"You haven't thought it 
through, Roi. We have. Not all 
spots on the surface of Planet X 
may be suitable. If the inhabitants are powerful and advanced, 
you may have to find an unobtrusive place for the Station. It 
won't do for us to appear in a 
city square, for example. And you 
will have to be certain that the 
immediate environment is not 
dangerous in other ways." 

"What other ways, sir?" 

"I don't knQW. The ancient 
records of the surface refer to 
many things we no longer understand. They don't explain because 
they took those phenomena for 
granted, but we have been away 
from the surface for almost a 
hundred thousand generations 
and we are puzzled. Our Techs 
aren't even in agreement on the 
physical nature of stars, and that 
is something the records mention 
and discuss frequently. But what 
are 'storms,' 'earthquakes,' 'volcanoes,* 'tornadoes,* 'sleet,' 'land


TH E DEEP 



147 



slides,' 'floods,' 'lightning' and so 
on? These are all terms which 
refer to surface phenomena that 
are dangerous* but we don't know 
what they are. We have no idea 
Of how to guard against them. 
Through your host's mind, you 
may be able to learn what is 
needful and take appropriate action." 

"How much time will I have, 
sir?" 

"The Resonizer cannot be kept 
in continuous operation for longer 
than twelve hours. I would prefer 
that you complete your job in 
two. You will return here automatically as soon as the Station 
is activated. Are you ready?" 

"I'm ready," said Roi. 

Gan led the way to the clouded 
glass cabinet. Roi took his seat, 
arranged his limbs in the appropriate depressions. His vibrissae 
dipped in mercury for good contact. 

Roi said, "What if I find myself in a body on the point of 
death?" 

Gan said, as he adjusted the 
controls, "The thought-field is 
distorted when a person is near 
death. No normal thought -field 
such as yours would be in 
resonance." 

"And if it is on the point of 
accidental death?" 

"We have thought of that, too. 
We can't guard against it, but 
the chance of death following so 



quickly that you have no time 
to activate the Station mentally 
is estimated as less than one in 
twenty trillion, unless the mysterious surface dangers are more 
deadly than we expect. You have 
one minute." 

For some strange reason, Roi's 
last thought before translation 
was of Wenda. 

IV 

1" AURA awoke with a sudden 
start. What had happened? 
She felt as though she had been 
jabbed with a pin. 

The afternoon sun was shining 
in her face and its dazzle made 
her blink. She lowered the shade 
and simultaneously bent to look 
at Walter. 

She was a little surprised to 
find his eyes open. This wasn't 
one of his waking periods. She 
looked at her wristwatch. No, it 
wasn't. And it was a good hour 
before feeding time, too. She followed the demand-feeding or 
the "if-you-want-it-holler-andyou'll-get-it" system, but ordinarily Walter followed the clock 
quite conscientiously. 

She wrinkled her nose at him. 
"Hungry, duckie?" 

Walter did not respond at all 
and Laura was disappointed. She 
would have liked to have him 
smile. Actually, she wanted him 
to laugh and throw his pudgy 



148 




 



arms about her neck and nuzzle 
her and say, "Mommie," but she 
knew he couldn't do any of that. 
He could smile, though. 

She put a light finger to his 
chin and tapped it a bit. "Googoo-goo-goo." He always smiled 
when she did that. 

But he only blinked at her. 

She said, "I hope he isn't sick." 
She looked at Mrs. Ellis in distress. 

Mrs. Ellis put down a magazine. "Is anything wrong, my 
dear?" 

"I don't know. Walter just lies 
there." 

"Poor little thing. He's tired, 
probably." 

"Shouldn't he be sleeping, 
then?" 

"He's in strange surroundings. 
He's probably wondering what 
it's all about." 

SHE rose, stepped across the 
aisle, and leaned across Laura 
to bring her own face close to 
Walter's. "You're wondering 
what's going on, you tiny little 
snookums. Yes, you are. You're 
saying, 'where's my nice little crib 
and all my nice little funnies on 
the wallpaper?' " 

Then she made little squeaking 
sounds at him. 

Walter turned his eyes away 
from his mother" and watched 
Mrs. Ellis somberly. 
Mrs. Ellis straightened sudden


ly and looked distressed. She put 
a hand to her head for a moment 
and murmured, "Goodness! The 
queerest pain." 

"Do you think he's hungry?" 
asked Laura. 

"Lord," said Mrs. Ellis, the 
trouble in her face fading, "they 
let you know when they're hungry 
soon enough. There's nothing 
wrong with him. I've had three 
children, dear. I know." 

"I think I'll ask the Stewardess 
to warm up another bottle." 

"Well, if it will make you feel 
better — " 

The stewardess brought the 
bottle and Laura lifted Walter 
out of his bassinette. She said, 
"You have your bottle and then 
I'll change you and then—" 

She adjusted his head in the 
crook of her elbow, leaned over to 
peck him quickly on the cheek, 
then cradled him close to her 
body as she brought the bottle 
to his lips. 

Walter screamed! 

His mouth stretched open, his 
arms pushed before him with his 
fingers spread wide, his whole 
body as stiff and hard as though 
in tetany, and he screamed. It 
rang through the whole compartment. 

Laura screamed, too. She dropped the bottle and it smashed 
with a white splash. 

Mrs. Ellis jumped up. Half a 
dozen others did, too. Mr. Ellis 



THE DEEP 



!49 




150 




 



snapped out of a light doze. 

"What's the matter?" asked 
Mrs. Ellis, blankly. 

"I don't know. I don't know." 
Laura was shaking Walter frantically, putting him over her 
shoulder, patting his back. "Baby, 
baby, don't cry. Baby, what's 
the matter? Baby — " 

The stewardess was dashing 
down the aisle. Her foot came 
within an inch of the cube that sat 
beneath Laura's seat. 

Walter was threshing about 
furiously now, yelling with calliope intensity and red -faced 
rage. 

V 

ROI'S mind flooded with shock. 
One moment he had been 
strapped in his chair in contact 
with the clear mind of Gan; the 
next (there was no consciousness 
of separation in time) he was 
immersed in a medley of strange, 
barbaric and broken thought. 

He closed his mind completely. 
It had % been open wide to increase the effectiveness of resonance, and the first touch of the 
alien had been — 

Not painful, no. Dizzying? 
Nauseating? No, not that, either. 
There was no word. 

He gathered resilience in the 
quiet nothingness of mind-closure 
and considered his position. He 
felt the small touch of the re


ceiving station with which he 
was in mental liaison. That had 
come with him. Good! 

He ignored his host for the 
moment. He might need him for 
drastic operations later, so it 
would be wise to raise no suspicions for the moment. 

He explored. He entered a mind 
at random and took stock first of 
the sense-impressions that permeated it. The creature was sensitive to parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and to vibrations 
of the air and, of course, to bodily contact. It possessed localized 
chemical senses — 

And that was all! 

He looked again in astonishment. Not only was there no direct mass-sense, no electro-potential sense, none of the really 
refined interpreters of the Universe, but there was no mental 
contact whatever. 

The creature's mind was completely isolated. 

Then how did they communicate? He looked further. They 
had a complicated code of controlled air vibrations. 

Were they intelligent? Had he 
chosen a maimed mind? No, they 
were all like that. 

He filtered the group of surrounding minds through his mental tendrils, searching for a Tech, 
or whatever passed for such 
among these crippled semi-intelligences. He found a mind which 



THE DEEP 



151 



thought of itself as a controller 
of vehicles. A piece of information flooded Roi. He was on an 
airborne vehicle. 

Then even without mental contact, they could build a rudimentary mechanical civilization. 
Or were they animal tools of real 
intelligences elsewhere on the 
planet? No, their minds said. 

He plumbed the Tech. What 
about the immediate environment? Were the bugbears of the 
ancients to be feared? It was a 
matter of interpretation. Dangers 
in the environment existed. Movements of air. Changes of temperature. ^ Water falling in the air, 
either as liquid or solid. Electrical 
discharges. There were codevibrations for each phenomenon, 
but that meant nothing. The connection of any of these with the 
names given to phenomena by the 
ancestral surface-folk was a matter of conjecture. 

No matter. Was there danger 
now? Was there danger here? 
Was there any cause for fear? 

The Tech's mind said there 
wasn't. 

That was enough. He returned 
to his host-mind and rested a 
moment, then cautiously expanded— 

Nothing! 

TTIS host-mind was blank. At 
most there was a vague sense 
of warmth and a dull flicker of 



undirected response to basic 
stimuli. 

Was his host dying, after all? 
Aphasic? Decerebrate? 

He moved quickly to the mind 
nearest, dredging it for information about his host, and shockedly finding it. 

His host was an infant of the 
species. 

An infant? A normal infant? 
And so undeveloped? 

He allowed his mind to sink 
into and coalesce for a moment 
with what existed in his host. 
He searched for the motor areas 
of the brain and found them 
with difficulty. A cautious stimulus was followed by an erratic 
motion of his host's extremities. 
He attempted finer control and 
failed. 

He felt anger. Had the Techs 
really thought of everything? Had 
they thought of intelligences without mental contact? Had they 
thought of young creatures as 
completely undeveloped as 
though they were still in the egg? 

It meant, of course, that he 
could not, in the person of his 
host, activate the Receiving Station. The muscles and mind were 
far too weak, far too uncontrolled for any of the three methods outlined by Gan. 

He thought intensely. He could 
scarcely expect to influence much 
mass through the imperfect focusing of his host's material brain 



152 




 



cells, but what about an indirect 
influence through an adult's brain. 
Direct physical influence would 
be minute; it would amount to 
the breakdown of the appropriate 
molecules of adenosine triphosphate and acetylcholine. Thereafter the adult creature would 
act on its own. 

He hesitated to try this, afraid 
of failure, then cursed himself for 
a coward. He entered the closest 
mind once more. It was a female 
of the species and it was in the 
state of temporary inhibition he 
had noticed in others. It didn't 
surprise him. Minds as rudimentary as these would need periodic 
respites. 

He considered the mind before 
him now, mentally fingering the 
areas that might respond to stimulation. He chose one, stabbed at 
it, and the conscious areas flooded 
with life almost simultaneously. 
Sense impressions poured in and 
the level of thought rose steeply. 

Good! 

But not good enough. That was 
a mere prod, a pinch. It was no 
order for specific action. 

He stirred uncomfortably as 
emotion cascaded over him. It 
came from the mind he had just 
stimulated and was directed, of 
course, at his host and not at him. 
Nevertheless, its primitive crudities annoyed him and he closed 
his mind against the unpleasant 
warmth of her uncovered feelings. 



A second mind centered about 
his host and, had he been material or had he controlled a 
satisfactory host, he would have 
struck out in vexation. 

Great Caverns, weren't they 
going to allow him to concentrate on his serious business? 

He thrust sharply at the second mind, activating centers of 
discomfort, and it moved away. 

He was pleased. That had been 
more than a simple, undefined 
stimulation, and it had worked 
nicely. He had cleared the mental 
atmosphere. 

TTE returned to the Tech who 
controlled the vehicle. That 
one would know the details concerning the surface over which 
they were passing. 
Water? 

He sorted the data quickly. 

Water! And more water! 

By the everlasting Levels — the 
word "ocean" made sense. The 
old, traditional word "ocean." 
Who would dream that so much 
water could exist? 

But if this was "ocean," then 
the traditional word "island" had 
an obvious significance. He thrust 
his whole mind into the quest 
for geographical information. The 
"ocean" was speckled with dots 
of land, but he needed exact 
data — 

He was interrupted by a short 
stab of surprise as his host moved 



THE DEEP 



!53 



through space, and was held 
against the neighboring female's 
body. 

Roi's mind, engaged as it was, 
lay open and unguarded. In full 
intensity, the female's emotions 
piled in upon him. 

Roi winced. In an attempt to 
remove the distracting animal 
passions, he clamped down upon 
the host's brain cells through 
which the rawness was funneling. 

He did that too quickly, too 
energetically. His host's mind 
flooded with a diffuse pain, and 
instantly almost every mind he 
could reach reacted to the airvibrations that resulted. 

In vexation, he tried to blanket 
the pain and succeeded only in 
stimulating it further. 

Through the clinging mental 
mist of his host's pain, he tried 
the Tech's minds, striving to prevent contact from slipping out of 
■ focus. 

His mind went icy. The best 
chance was almost now! He had 
perhaps twenty minutes. There 
would be other chances afterward, 
but not as good. Yet he dared 
not attempt to direct the actions 
of another while his host's mind 
was in such complete disorganization. 

He retired, withdrew into mindclosure, maintaining only the 
most tenuous connection with 
his host's spinal cells, and waited. 

Minutes passed and little by 



little he returned to fuller liaison. 
He had five minutes left. 
He chose a subject. 

VI 

HPHE stewardess said, "I think 
he's beginning to feel a little 
better, poor little thing." 

"He never acted like this before," insisted Laura, tearfully. 
"Never." 

"He just had a little colic, I 
guess," said the stewardess. 

"Maybe he's bundled up too 
much," suggested Mrs. Ellis. 

"Maybe," agreed the stewardess. "It's quite warm." 

She unwrapped the blanket and 
lifted the nightgown to expose a 
heaving abdomen, pink and bulbous. Walter was still whimpering. 

The stewardess said, "Shall I 
change him for you? He's quite 
wet." 

"Would you, please?" 

Most of the nearer passengers 
had returned to their seats. The 
more distant ceased craning their 
necks. 

Mr. Ellis remained in the aisle 
with his wife. He said, "Say, 
look." 

Laura and the stewardess were 
too busy to pay him attention 
and Mrs. Ellis ignored him out of 
sheer habit. 

Mr. Ellis was used to that. His 
remark was purely rhetorical, 
anyway. He bent over and tugged 



154 




 



at the box beneath the seat. 

Mrs. Ellis looked down impatiently. She said, "Goodness, 
George, don't be dragging at other 
people's luggage like that. Sit 
down. You're in the way." 

Mr. Ellis straightened in confusion. 

Laura, with eyes still red and 
weepy, said, "It isn't mine. I 
didn't even know it was under 
the seat." 

The stewardess, looking up 
from the whining baby, asked, 
"What isit?" 

Mr. Ellis shrugged. "It's a box." 

His wife said, "Well, what do 
you want with it, for Heaven's 
sake?" 

Mr. Ellis- groped for a reason. 
What did he want with it? He 
mumbled, "I was just curious." 

The stewardess said, "There, 
the little boy is all nice and dry, 
and I'll bet in two minutes he'll 
just be as happy as anything. 
Hmm? Won't you, little funnyface?" 

But little funny-face was still 
sobbing. He turned his head away 
sharply as the bottle was once 
more offered to him. 

The stewardess said, "Let me 
warm it a bit. It's probably too 
cold for him now." 

She took it and went back 
down the aisle, 

Mr. Ellis came to a decision. 
Firmly, he lifted the box and 
balanced it on the arm of his 



seat. He ignored his wife's frown. 

He said, "I'm not doing it any 
harm. I'm just looking. What's 
it made of, anyway?" 

TTE rapped it with his knuckles. 

None of the other passengers 
seemed interested. They paid no 
attention to either Mr. Ellis or 
the box. It was as though something had switched off that particular line of interest among 
them. Even Mrs. Ellis, in conversation with Laura, kept her back 
to him. 

Mr. Ellis tipped the box up and 
found the opening. He knew it 
had to have an opening. It was 
large enough for him to insert a 
finger, though there was no reason, of course, why he should 
want to put a finger into a strange 
box. 

Carefully, he reached in. There 
was a black knob which he irrationally longed to touch. He 
pressed it. 

The box shuddered and was 
suddenly out of his hands and 
passing through the arm of the 
chair. 

He caught another glimpse of it 
moving through the floor and 
then there was unbroken flooring 
and nothing more. Slowly, he 
spread out . his hands and stared 
at his palms. Dropping to his 
knees, he felt the floor. 

The stewardess, returning with 
the bottle, asked politely, "Have 



THE DEEP 



155 



you lost something, sir?" 

Mrs. Ellis, looking down, said, 
"George!" 

Mr. Ellis heaved himself upward. He was flushed and flustered. He said, "The box — It slipped out and went down — " 

The stewardess said, "What 
box, sir?" 

Laura said, "May I have the 
bottle, miss? He's stopped crying." 

"Certainly. Here it is." 

Walter opened his mouth eagerly, accepting the nipple. Air 
bubbles moved upward through 
the milk and there were little 
swallowing sounds. 

Laura looked up, radiantly. 
"He seems fine now. Thank you, 
Stewardess, and you, Mrs. Ellis. 
For a while there, it almost 
seemefl" as though he weren't my 
little boy." 

"He'll be all right," said Mrs. 
Ellis. "Maybe it was just a bit' 
of air-sickness. Sit down, George." 

The stewardess said, "Just call 
me if you need me." , 

"Thank you," said Laura. ' 

Mr. Ellis said, "The box — V and 
stopped. 

What box? He didn't remember 
any box. 

BUT one mind aboard the 
plane could follow the black 
cube as it dropped in a parabola, 
unimpeded by wind or air resistance, passing through the 



molecules of gas that lay in 
its way. 

Below it, the atoll was a tiny 
bull's-eye in a huge target. Once, 
during a time of war, it had 
boasted an airstrip and barracks. 
The barracks had collapsed, the 
airstrip was a vanishing ragged 
line, and the atoll was empty. 

The cube struck the feathery 
foliage of a palm and not a frond 
was disturbed. It passed through 




5 56 




 



the trunk and down to the coral. 
It sank straight into the planet 
without the smallest fog of dust 
kicked up to tell of its entrance. 

Far below the surface of the 
soil, the cube passed into stasis 
and remained motionless, mingled 
intimately with the atoms of 
compressed rock, yet remaining 
distinct. 

That was all. It was night, then 
day. It rained, the wind blew, 



and the Pacific waves broke 
whitely -on the white coral. Nothing had happened. 

Nothing would happen — for ten 
years. 

VII 

^ \% /E have broadcast the 
news," said Gan, "that 
you have succeeded. I think you 
ought to rest now." 




Roi said, "Rest? Now? When 
I'm back with complete minds? 
Thank you, but no. The enjoyment is too keen." 

"Did intelligence without mental contact bother you so much?" 

"Yes," said Roi, shortly. 

Gan tactfully refrained from 
attempting to follow the line of 
retreating thought. 

Instead, he asked, "And the 
surface?" 

Roi said, "Entirely horrible. 
What the ancients called 'sun' is 
an unbearable patch of brilliance 
overhead . It is apparently a 
source of light and varies periodically: 'day' and 'night,' in other 
words. There is also unpredictable variation." 

" 'Clouds,' perhaps," said Gan. 

"Why 'clouds'?" 

"You know the traditional 
phrase: 'Clouds hid the sun.' " 

"You think so? Yes, it could 
be." 

"Well, go on." 

"Let's see. 'Ocean' and 'island' 
I've explained. 'Storm' involves 
wetness in the air, falling in drops. 
'Wind' is a movement of air on 
a huge scale. 'Thunder' is either 
a spontaneous static discharge in 
the air or a great spontaneous 
noise. 'Sleet' is falling ice." 

GA"N said, "That's a curious 
one. Where would ice fall 
from? How? Why?" 

"I haven't the slightest idea. 



It's all very variable. It will storm 
at one time and not at another. 
There are apparently regions on 
the surface where it is always 
cold, others where it is always hot, 
still others where it is both at 
different times*-" ' 

"Astonishing. How much, of 
this do you suppose is misinterpretation of alien minds?" 

"None. I'm sure of that. It was 
all quite plain. I had sufficient 
time to plumb their queer minds. 
Too much time, as a matter of 
fact." - 
Again his thoughts drifted back 
into privacy. 

Gan said, "This is excellent, 
Roi. I've been afraid all along 
of our tendency to romanticize 
the so-called Golden Age of our 
surface ancestors. I felt that there 
would be a strong impulse among 
our group in favor of a new surface life." 

"No," said Roi, vehemently. 

"Obviously not. I doubt if the 
hardiest among us would consider even a day of life in an environment such as you describe 
with its storms, days, nights, its 
indecent and unpredictable variations in environment." Gan's 
thoughts were contented ^ones. 
"Tomorrow we begin the process 
of transfer. Once on the island — 
an uninhabited one, you say?" 

"Entirely uninhabited. It was 
only one of that type the vessel 
passed over. The Tech's informa



 



tion was detailed." 

"Good. We will begin excavating operations. It will take generations, of course, but in the 
end, we will be" in the Deep of a 
new, warm world, in pleasant 
caverns where the controlled environment will be conducive to 
the growth of every culture and 
refinement." 

"And," added Roi, "no contact 
whatever with the surface creatures." 

Gan said, "Why that? Primitive though they are, they might 
be of help to us once we establish 
our base. A race that can build 
aircraft must have some abilities." 

"It isn't that. They're a belligerent lot, sir. They would attack 
with animal ferocity at all occasions and — " 

Gan interrupted. "I am disturbed at the psycho -penumbra 
that surrounds your references to 
the aliens. There's something you 
are concealing." 

ROI said, "I thought at first 
we could make use of them. 
If they wouldn't allow us to be 
friends, at least we could control them. I made one of thdm 
close the contact inside the cube 
and that was difficult. Very difficult. Their minds are basically 
different." 

"In what way?" 

"If I could describe it, the 



difference wouldn't be basic. But 
I can give you an example. I was 
in the mind of an infant. They 
cion't have maturation chambers. 
The infants are in the charge 
of individuals. The creature who 
was in charge of my host — " He 
stopped in disgust. 

"Yes?" Gan encouraged. 

"She — it was a female — felt a 
special tie to the young one. There 
was a sense of ownership, of a 
relationship that excluded the 
remainder of their society. I 
seemed to detect dimly something 
of the emotion that binds a man 
to an associate or friend, but it 
was far more intense and un- t 
restrained." 

"Well," said Gan, "without 
mental contact, they probably 
have no real conception of society, and sub-relationships may 
build up. Or was this one pathological?" 

"No, no. It's universal. The female in charge was the infant's 
mother." 

"Impossible! It's own mother?" 

"Of necessity. The infant had 
passed the first part of its existence inside its mother. Physically 
inside! The creatures' eggs remain within the body. They are 
fertilized within the body. They 
grow within the body and emerge 
alive." 

"Great Caverns!" Gan said, 
weakly. His own sense of revulsion was as strong as Roi's. "Then 



THE DEEP 



159 



each creature would know the 
identity of its own child! Each 
child would have a specific father!" 

"And he would be known, too. 
My host was being taken five 
thousand miles, as nearly as I 
could judge the distance, to be 
seen by its father." 

"Unbelievable!" 

"Do you need more to realize 
that there can never be any meeting of minds? The difference is 
too fundamental, too complete." 

The yellowness of regret tinged 
and roughened Gan's thoughttrain. He said, "It would be too 
bad. I had thought — " 

"What, sir?" 

"I had thought that for the 
first time there would be two intelligences helping one another. 
T had thought that together we 
might progress more quickly than 



either could alone. Even if they 
were primitive technologically, as 
they are, technology isn't everything. I had thought we might 
still be able to learn from them." 

"Learn what?" asked Roi, brutally. "To know our parents and 
make friends of our children?" 

Gan said, "No, no ! You're 
quite right. The barrier between 
us must remain forever complete. 
They will have the surface and 
we the Deep, and so it will be." 




( UTSIDE the laboratories, Roi 
met Wend a. 



Her thoughts were concentrated pleasure. "I'm glad you're 
back." 

Roi's thoughts were pleasurable, too. It was very restful to 
make clean mental contact with 
a friend.
