The Reluctant Weapon by HOWARD L. MYERS 

When the Zoz Horde passed 
destructively through this sector 
of the Galaxy, approximately a 
billion years ago, they suffered 
a minor loss. One of their weap


ons, Sentient Killer No. VT672, 
had an unexplained malfunction 
and was left behind to be repaired by the slave technicians 
who followed the Horde. How



ever, the Zoz were met and annihilated by the Ghesh Empire, 
after which the masterless slaves 
dispersed to their home planets. 
The weapon, unrepaired, was left 
forgotten in the solar system it 
had tailed to destroy. 

TRESQU the Wisest, Ruler 
of Hova, Lord of the Universe, was being entertained by a troupe of Goefd 
dancers when his Lord of War, 
Wert, bounded into the Audience 
Hall. In his hurry to reach Tresqu's throne, Wert slipped on the 
nearly frictionless floor and skidded through the formation of 
dancers, sending the slender 
Goefden sprawling in all directions. He slid to a halt by the 
Pleading Mat, onto which he 
crawled and groveled, awaiting 
permission to speak. 

"I believe three of the dancers 
received broken legs," Tresqu observed calmly. "They are rather 
delicate creatures and not at all 
clumsy." He dipped the tip of his 
tail into an urn of chilled perfume 
and gently dabbed it about his 
nostril. Speaking pleasantly, with 
long pauses between sentences, he 
kept his friendly gaze on the 
groveling Wert. "Oft I meditate 
on the clumsiness of our race in 
comparison to many others who 
are our graceful servants. Why, 
I wonder, cannot the rulers be 
graceful? Some of us are very 



clumsy indeed — too clumsy to 
live." 

A tremor passed through Wert's 
stocky body. 

"Possibly my Lord of War has 
news of sufficient import to excuse his ungainly haste. But I 
sincerely doubt it. I fear I must 
soon appoint a successor to him. 
Undoubtedly he has news of some 
sort. Blurt, Wert!" 

"Your Majestic Wisdom," 
whined Wert, "my message is»of 
utmost importance! The natives 
of Sol III have captured one of 
our decontaminator ships and 
learned its secrets!" 

"Sol III?" 

"Yes, Your Wisdom. The planet called Terra." 

"Terra? You must realize, 
lordling, that I cannot occupy 
myself with remembering trivialities about individual worlds." 

"Yes, Your Wisdom. We have 
a base, which is commanded by — 
that is, we had a base commanded — " 

"Enough!" snapped Tresqu. 
"You start your tale from nowhere and wander whence and 
hence!" He raised his voice and 
called to one of his retainers. 
"Fool! Come forward!" 

An abnormally slender Hovan 
arose from a platform off to Tresqu's left and skipped nimbly forward to stand insolently over the 
Lord of War, who was still prone 
on the Pleading Mat.

"Recite for me," said Tresqu, 
"the contents of my gazetteer on 
the planet Sol III. Listen well, 
Wert. You may even yet live 
long enough to profit by my 
Fool's style of declamation. 
Study it well. Also, you may 
raise your eyes sufficiently to observe the grace of his movements. 
Proceed, sprite." 

"Sol III," began the Fool. "An 
H9 planet. Sol is in the Sirian 
Colony Sector, coordinates GL 
15-44-17-5, GR 12 7 plus 9, D 14. 
Terra's life is normal animalvegetable, with one intelligent 
species of hovoids called Humans. 
Due to the unpleasantly high 
oxygen content of the atmosphere, Terra has not been colonized, but has been placed under 
the control of the Science Ministry for the purpose of long-range 
psychological experiments." The 
Fool picked up Wert's tail and 
twisted it hard but absently as 
he talked. The Lord of War 
twitched painfully. "Many informative reports on the results of 
these experiments have been released by the ministry during the 
past seven thousand years, dealing mainly with the Humans. The 
Science Ministry has declared 
Terra out of bounds — Positively 
no visitors." 

With a single flow of motion, 
the Fool gave Wert's tail a final 
twist, leaped over his body, and 
bowed deeply to Tresqu. 



"Beautifully done. Fool," applauded the Ruler of Hova. "Your 
mother claims me as your father, 
and there are times I am inclined 
to believe her. How would you 
like to be my Lord of War, 
Fool?" 

."Verily, my good master," said 
the Fool, "I hope _you consider 
me a Fool by title only." 

"Well said. Fool. You are spared. Go seek your pleasures." 

With another bow, the Fool 
backed away. 

"Stand up, Wert," said Tresqu, 
"and tell me about this captured 
decontamination ship." 

The Lord of War arose and 
managed to report with some 
smoothness. "Two years ago, the 
Science Ministry turned Terra 
over to my command, saying their 
long series of experiments was 
concluded. T hey recom mended 
complete decontamination of the 
planet, since the Humans were 
developing technologies which 
could eventually threaten us. 1 
dispatched a ship for that purpose immediately, but it failed 
to return. Also, reports from our 
base on Terra's satelite Luna 
ceased soon thereafter. A scouting 
expedition was sent. It has just 
reported the Luna base destroyed 
completely, and the decontaminator ship crashed and stripped of 
all important devices in one of 
the Terran deserts. By studying 
these removed devices, the Hu


82 




 



mans have undoubtedly developed protections against them. 

"I humbly submit, Your Majestic Wisdom, that these events 
have endangered the safety of 
your glorious empire, and that 
drastic steps against the Humans 
should be taken immediately. 
Also, Good Lord of All, I submit 
that the Science Ministry, not the 
War Ministry, is at fault in this 
affair. They obviously let their 
experiments get out of control 
before calling us. Undoubtedly 
they would like to shift the full 
blame onto my shoulders." 

Tresqu continued his pleasant 
demeanor. "There may be some 
truth in what you say, Wert. You 
overestimate the danger in this 
matter, I perceive. After all, what 
is one backward planet against 
the forces of my empire containing thirty-seven well-armed 
worlds? The Humans will be destroyed, even if they have the 
secrets of a decontaminator ship. 
As for the blame, which I admit 
is deplorable, the Lord of Science 
will be called to the Mat to make 
his excuses. Now, assuming you 
remain Lord of War, what action 
do you plan to take against the 
Humans?" 

"Your Gracious Wisdom," faltered Wert, "I suggest we use the 
— the Weapon. You see, our forces 
are not fully mobilized at present for immediate action — " 

"Full mobilization isn't neces


sary or even desirable," Tresqu 
interrupted with some impatience. 
"One task force can do the job. 
Ah ! I see by your expression that 
you do not have even one task 
force in readiness." 

"Your Gracious Wisdom," begged Wert, "you ordered a full 
holiday this month to celebrate 
the twenty-fourth anniversary of 
your magnificent reign, and — " 

"Enough, Wert! Your tongue 
is as clumsy as your body." Tresqu nibbled thoughtfully at the 
tip of his tail. "We will use the 
Weapon," he decided. "In order 
to allow my court to continue 
their holiday, I'll assume direct 
command in this." He rose from 
his throne. "Musicians, summon 
my guards. I go to visit the Weapon. Come, Wert; come also, Fool. 
You will accompany me." 

OHORTLY thereafter, Tresqu 
^ and his entourage boarded the 
royal cruiser and roared away 
from the City of Wisdom. The 
ship flew halfway around the 
planet and came to rest in a 
peaceful purple valley where insects shrilled contentedly and a 
small stream rippled. Tresqu 
climbed out onto the violet turf, 
his followers coming after him. 

"Mighty Weapon of Zoz," he 
cailed, "I, Tresqu, seek your 
presence !" 

"Oh, no \" groaned a slightly 
mechanical voice that seemed to 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



S3 



come from no particular direction. "Will there never be peace, 
never a tranquil moment to 
soothe my jfpirit and erase the 
bloody stains of destruction recorded on my past?" 

"That voice ! It carries me 
away!" breathed the Fool. "Such 
a tragic tale of tormented strength 
is implicit in its very tone that 
I think I shall swoon!" But he 
wrapped his tail around the trunk 
of a nearby sapling for support 
and managed to retain consciousness. 

"Me, too!" Wert chimed in with 
suspicious haste. "I'm quite 
moved !" 

"Try not to counterfeit a soul 
you do not possess." Tresqu 
glowered at Wert. "You deceive 
no one." 

The Fool was recovered sufficiently to* hit the discomfited 
Lord of War with a pebble when 
Tresqu was not watching. 

The Weapon had drifted into 
sight during this exchange, floating out of a shady hollow, as if 
blown by a breeze. It was very 
simple in appearance — an impalpable three-foot glowing sphere 
with a squat metallic cylinder at 
its base. 

"Tell me not the purpose of 
your visit, petty lord!" It said. 
"It is known to me only too well. 
Ah, great First Principle! Little 
did I reck when, in ages past, I 
nursed your species to civiliza
84 



tion, just how poorly you would 
serve my purpose. Peace it was 
I desired, but do I get it? No! 
Your kingdom is powerful, but 
you have not the strength to 




handle your own troubles. You 
rule twenty-nine planets — " 

"Thirty -seven," corrected Tresqu politely. 

" — thirty-seven planets, but 
when a malignant force appears 
on your borders, I, the Weapon, 
must be called upon to act in my 
own defense, and for the sake of 
a few more restful moments in 
this calm glade, I am obliged to 


 



destroy, yet it was to avoid destroying that I helped your species to empire in the old days." 

"In truth." spoke the deeply 
sympathetic Tresqu, "yours is 
a sad story. I disturb your richly 
earned rest only after the sincerest soul-searching. But affairs of 
state are at cross purposes in a 
moment of crisis, and without 
your help Hova will be in 
danger." 

"Ah, cruel Fate!" entoned the 
Weapon, "It aids me in no manner to protest against your inscrutable machinations! There is 
no turning aside, no avoidance of 
necessity!" In a less declamatory 
style, the Weapon addressed 
Tresqu: "Very well, what is the 
trouble?" 

Tresqu described the events on 
Terra for the Weapon, concluding, "Now that the Humans have 
knowledge of our space drive and 
armament, they are certain to attack, especially if they realize 
they have been subjects for experiment." 

The Weapon flitted about restlessly along the bank of the 
brook. "I question the motives of 
my own thoughts. Do I quibble 
with myself in an attempt to escape unwelcome necessities? Tell, 
petty lord, do your scientists confirm the picture you paint of the 
Humans? Are they, like you, alas, 
masterfully vicious enough to destroy the peace of dozens of 



planets for nothing but revenge?" 

"So the scientists say, mighty 
Weapon," answered Tresqu. 

"You, Lord of War, why are 
you silent when your face is 
strained with words crying for expression?" asked the Weapon. 
"Speak your mind." 

Wert squirmed. "If it please 
Your Mightiness, and you. Your 
Gracious Wisdom, I believe the 
Humans will know that we desire 
their destruction, and will try to 
defeat us for the sake of their own 
survival rather than revenge." 

"A most convincing point, Lord 
of, War," said the Weapon. 

Tresqu flashed a forgiving smile 
at Wert while the Weapon paused 
before continuing: 

"However, I fear my unwilling 
spirit refuses to bow to the most 
reasonable of arguments. Please 
leave me; solve the problem 
yourselves!" 

Tresqu bowed and moved to-, 
ward the cruiser. "We obey, 
Mighty Guide of our fathers. Let 
me say in parting that I, too, «am 
grieved by our talk, much more 
because of the* pain our visit has 
caused your noble greatness than 
because our race is threatened 
with annihilation. My deepest 
hope is that the ravages of war 
will never reach this peaceful 
place which is so dear to your 
gentle being." 

-"Wait!" groaned the Weapon. 
"To slay, or not to slay, that is 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



85 



the dilemma. Ah, had my old 
masters of Zoz only left within 
my powers the seed of my own 
destruction, I would gladly seek 
the consummation of ultimate 
peace. But, no, that door is closed 
to me by deathless locks. Bring 
me a Human, that I may learn 
to hate him. Choose the most 
ignoble specimen available. I will 
converse with him at length so 
as to become exasperated with all 
the despicable traits of his race. 
Then, in my contempt for those 
traits, I will be able to cleanse 
the Universe of all Humans." 

Tresqu turned quickly to his 
Fool. "Are there any Humans on 
Hova?" 

"Yes, in the biological research 
laboratories." 

"Tljen go quickly, Fool, and 
fetch one. This is a grave matter, 
and I trust you to choose the 
most monstrous specimen available. Hurry!" 

The Fool ran into the cruiser 
and was on his way, leaving 
Tresqu, Wert, and several guardsmen with the Weapon. If the 
Weapon was conscious of the fact 
that the Lord of Hova was staying behind out of courtesy, it did 
not show it. Instead, it wandered 
indifferently away, mumbling a 
soliloquy of guilt and misery. 

THE sight of the Fool's specimen of humanity repaid Tresqu for the tediousness of the 



waiting. It was a particularly 
sordid -looking creature with a 
dirty growth of hairs on its head 
and face. Its body, thin as the 
Fool's, but with no compensating 
grace of movement, was clad in 
a blue garment of roughly woven 
vegetable fibers, and the extremities of its nether limbs were enclosed in evil-smelling boxes of 
animal hide. Its fierce eyes darted 
ominously from one Hovan to another. Its jaw kept working in a 
slow rhythm, and occasionally a 
stream of black liquid exploded 
through its mouth. 

"You have done well, Fool," 
said Tresqu. "You will be rewarded highly." Raising his voice 
he called, "Mighty Weapon, your 
specimen awaits!" 

"I come!" Once more the 
Weapon floated into view. 

The Earthman's jaw sagged. 
"*Y God!" he muttered in English, staring at the approaching 
Weapon. 

"Indeed," said the Weapon, 
"this appears to be a creature I 
could learn to abhor and kill. If 
only its thoughts equal its appearance — Speak, Human!" 

The man said nothing. 

"Mighty Weapon," murmured 
the Fool, "this Human is truly an 
ignoble monster. He has been in 
captivity for five years and has 
yet to speak a word of our beautiful language instead of his own 
barbaric tongue." 



36 




 



"You fool!" Shouted Tresqu. 
"How is the Weapon going to 
converse with him? Why did you 
bring one that cannot talk?" 

Not in the least disconcerted, 
the Fool replied, "As you ordered, 
good master, I brought the worst 
specimen available. However, the 
possibility of linguistic difficulties was not overlooked. I have 
here a dictionary of his language, 
recently compiled by our Alien 
Affairs staff." He produced a 
large volume of manuscript from 
beneath his cloak. 

"Your Fool shows wisdom, 
petty lord," spoke the Weapon. 
"I will study this book. Know the 
language, know the people, it is 
wisely said. In fact, I originated 
that saying myself some three 
thousand years ago, I believe. Unship any supplies brought for the 
Human and begone. Three days 
will suffice for the arousal of my 
wrath. Return then." 

"As you wish, O Mightiest of 
All." Tresqu bowed gawkily. "It 
is my most ardent desire, Wondrous Guide, that we, your servants, will not be obliged to disturb your peace again for a 
thousand centuries, once this affair is concluded." 

"And mine," the Weapon snapped crossly. "Now leave me." 

THE man watched the Hovans 
enter their cruiser and fly 
away. Looking at the Weapon 



hovering nearby, he squatted on 
his heels and pulled up a blade 
of purple grass to chew. Minutes 
passed in silence. Then the Weapon moved away, the book bobbing along behind, supported by 
some unseen force. 

When it was out of sight, the 
man muttered, " 'Y God, I've 
saw fireballs in my time, but 
that's the first one I ever saw 
settin' in a bucket!" 

After a thoughtful examination 
of his surroundings, the man 
stood up and walked to the packing cases the Hovans had left. All 
but one contained the synthetic 
food product to which he had 
grown acccustomed in his five 
years of captivity. The other box, 
rather* small, contained a shredded vegetable which served him 
as a poor substitute for chewing 
tobacco. Purple when growing, 
the leaves of this vegetable were 
blue-black when cured, making 
his frequent expectorations look 
like ink. 

"Filthy damn stuff!" he grunted, stuffing several handfuls in 
an empty overall pocket. 

He shuffled down to the brook 
and tested its temperature with 
a hand. Finding it rather cold, 
he decided against taking a bath. 
Instead, he spat into it and 
watched meditatively as the spot 
of black was carried downstream. 
"I wonder what they turned me 
loose for," he monologued. 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



87 



Careful to avoid the spot where 
the Weapon appeared to have 
gone, he returned to the food 
supply and ate. By then it was 
getting dark, and he bedded down 
for the night on some thick grass 
under a tree. 

" *Y God," he yawned, "I'm 
glad all these insects don't want 
nothin' to do with me." 

The Weapon was waiting beside him when he woke up next 
morning. "Eyes of your Terran 
Deity," it said, "I shall now converse with you in your own 
tongue. Name yourself, creature!" 

r |^HE man sat up startled. A 
moment passed before he 
said, "I'm Jake — Jacob Absher. 
What was that you said?" 

"My pronunciation is above reproach* Jacob. Therefore I will 
not repeat myself. Attend me 
closely or I shall punish you." 

" 'Y God, I heard you all right 
and you didn't make sense!" said 
Jacob, determined not to be 
frightened. "Now if you aim to 
talk with me, stop imitatin' a professor and talk so's a man can understand you. I ain't scared of 
you, so leave off makin' threats!" 

"Such stupid insolence!" gloated the Weapon. "Already I feel 
my wrath growing within me ! 
Since it will anger me even more 
to explain my words to you, I 
will do exactly that. My first 
words to you were, 'Eyes of your 



Terran Diety,* an expression you 
use frequently in a corrupted 
form to begin your statements. 
By studying your language, I 
learned that 'Zounds' is a similar 
corruption referring to the wounds 
of the Deity, while 'Strewth' refers to your God's truth. Thus, 
I was able to understand, and 
state in uncorrupted form, your 
remark, 'Eye God.' " 

" 'Tain't what it means," objected Jacob, filling his mouth 
with ersatz tobacco. "It just 
means by God." 

The Weapon considered this. 
"And exactly what is the significance of such a remark?" 

Jacob scratched his whiskered 
chin. "I reckon you got me there. 
I guess it means that I mean 
what I say." 

"In other words, any statement 
you make following that phrase 
is to be taken seriously?" 
"Somethin' like that." 
"Then it follows that your 
other statements, without the 'by 
God' preface, are not seriously 
intended. Are they jokes or lies?" 

"That ain't the way it is at 
all ! I just say 'by God' when 
I feel like it, not every time I'm 
bein' serious." 

"Monstrous inconsistency!" 
groaned the Weapon dramatically. "Ah, chaotic universe! Is 
there then no sublime plan, no 
fateful development to your endless succession of days? How 



88 



GALAXY 5CIENCE FICTION 



could even the most synoptic 
First Principle find a purpose for 
creating such an unplanned, unreasonable species as the Humans? Can it be — unhappy 
thought! — that there is no plan 
to it all, and we exist for naught?" 

Jacob listened with open 
mouth. "Say," he broke in, "are 
you some kind of play-actor?" 

"That is what I ask myself," 
the Weapon continued its oratorical flight. "Are we all actors, 
speaking the lines written for us 
by a Great Playwright who plans 
to unite all the threads of his 
plot in a universal climax to 
come? Or are we poor random 
creatures without purpose?" It 
paused and added in a more conversational tone, "But that is not 
what you mean by your question. 
No, I am not a play-actor. I am 
an unfortunate weapon, reluctant 
to employ myself for my intended 
purpose of destruction of life and 
unsuited by my structure for the 
doing of deeds more worthy in 
nature." 

Jacob squinted about. "A weapon, huh? Let's see you hit that 
bird thing sittin' in that tree over 
there." 

"Bloodthirsty fiend! I do not 
kill for amusement!" 

"I just wanted to see how you 
worked," said the abashed Jacob. 
"All I've seen you do is float 
around and talk a blue streak. 
As far as I'm concerned, you 



ain't nothin' but a big-mouthed 
bluff." 

"Very well, Jacob. If you have 
formed such an erroneous attitude, it will be necessary for me 
to correct you immediately. Observe the red boulder on yonder 
hill." 

"I see it." 

T^HE cylindrical base of the 
Weapon swung to point briefly 
at the boulder, which quietly 
crumbled to dust. 

"I be dog!" yelped Jacob. He 
looked at the Weapon with respect, "You sure pulverized it! 
How do you work?" 

"You could not understand the 
processes involved. Suffice it to 
say I have the means to collect 
energy in general and retransmit 
it in specific forms and directions. 
But enough of this. You are here 
to answer questions, not ask them. 
First, tell me what you did in 
an average day on Terra." 

"That what you call the world 
I live on?" 

"Yes." 

"I'm a farmer, you know. I got 
a place in the Smoky Mountains 
in Tennessee. First thing in the 
mornin', I'd go feed the livestock 
while Suzy cooked breakfast." A 
faraway look came into Jacob's 
eyes. "Guess she took the kids 
and went to live with her mammy 
when these here "animals grabbed 
me ..." 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



89 



"Continue," commanded the 
Weapon. 

"Huh? Well, then we'd eat 
breakfast. Come to think of it, 
I ain't et yet this mornin'." Jacob 
got up and went to get himself 
some breakfast. 

"But this matter — " protested 
the Weapon. 

"Not on an empty stomach," 
Jacob said calmly, eating without 
haste. 

WHEN he returned, the Weapon questioned him further 
about his life on Terra. Hours of 
ill-tempered conversation passed. 

"Such drabness!" the Weapon 
finally exclaimed. "Creatures who 
lead such dull lives as yours 
should welcome extinction. Not 
once*have you mentioned an appreciation of the wondrous exhaltation that comes from an esthetic 
feel for beauty. With the labor 
of providing for your grotesque 
body's animal cravings is your 
whole life spent. Not in anger, 
but as an act of mercy, can I 
exterminate your defective race!" 

Jacob's mouth hung open. "So 
that's what your monkey's brung 
me out here for — fixin' to kill us! 
'Y God, you better look out! We 
got atom bombs on Earth an' 
we'll use 'em on you if you try 
anything!" 

"Toys!" sneered the Weapon. 
"Be assured, Jacob, that I have 
nothing to fear from any childish 



mechanisms your Terrans can 
contrive!" 

Jacob sat stunned. "But you 
said a minute ago you couldn't 
kill nothin'!" 

"I can kill only when I'm convinced it is best for my own repose or for the health of the 
Universe. Long ago, I could go 
forth at battle with thoughtless 
joy at the command of my masters of Zoz, but now I must have 
reasons, must converse at length 
with my aberrated emotions, 
must prepare myself as for an 
ordeal." 

"Them Zozes must've been the 
Devil's minions," argued Jacob. 
"The Commandments says, 
'Thou shalt not kill' and when 
you go against that, you're goin' 
against the word of God." 

"Poor, futile creature !" sympathized the Weapon. "You actually strive to pit your naive 
superstitious mind against • my 
highly developed mentality in argument. You actually associate 
my supreme masters of old with 
your puny mythological villain! 
Lowliness should know its place. 
But I feel no anger — merely & 
pitying desire to relieve your kind 
of the burden of living." 

Silently, Jacob replenished the 
wad of "tobacco" in his mouth. 
After chewing a while, he spat 
and said dolefully, "I don't reckon there's nothin' I can say or 
do that you won't hold against 



90 




 



me. I always heard tell the Devil 
can twist anything to suit hisself, 
and I reckon his minions can do 
the same thing. An' that's what 
you are: the Devil's minion! I 
reckon you break every Commandment God give us. Except 
about committin' adultery. I 
don't guess you can do that." 

"Your piddling reproductive 
customs have no application on 
my plane of existence. Cannot 
you comprehend that you are less 
to me than a microbe? Even my 
servants, the Hovans, do not concern themselves with such ignoble 
concepts as what you call adultery!" 

"You mean they live in sin?" 
asked Jacob. 

"They mate as often as they 
please with anyone they please," 
the Weapon replied coldly. "I 
will ignore the ludicrous implications of your absurd moral concepts." 

"I don't mean to criticize your 
animal friends," glowered Jacob. 
"I reckon they ain't children of 
God. so it don't matter if they 
do mate like a pack of dogs. They 
probably ain't got no souls to 
keep pure. It looked to me like 
they worshiped you like a false 
god, too." 

"They . . . O Great Hidden 
Manifestation!" squalled the 
Weapon in rage. "They regard 
me as their guide and mentor. 
Nothing more. I would not allow 



anything else." 

Jacob watched the Weapon 
in awe. The energy globe was 
nickering and flaring wildly in an 
uncontrolled display of color. 
" 'Y God!" he exclaimed. "You 
sure are puttin' on a fireworks 
show!" 

The globe settled down to a 
tensely nervous fluctuation which 
hurt Jacob's eyes to watch. 
"Never in the ageless span of my 
existence," quavered the Weapon 
angrily, "have I been insulted 
in such vulgar terms by any 
creature. And now from you, 
creature whom my glorious masters of Zoz would exterminate 
like a buzzing fly, like a disease 
germ, I hear these senseless 
mouthings of defamation! Stop 
it or I shall destroy you outright!" 

The Weapon's fluctuating, 
along with its loud, grating voice, 
put Jacob's nerves on edge. He 
growled, "I bet your old Zozes 
live in adultery just like your 
animal friends." 

The color of the energy globe 
sank to dull red and the Weapon 
emitted a series of buzzing, inarticulate noises. 

"It suits not my nature, bit of 
diseased scum, to slay you in a 
fit of indignation," it finally said 
with tightly controlled fury. "You 
are beneath such individual recognition. Yet it is fortunate for 
you that your insults have no

basis in reality, otherwise my intellect could not have claimed 
ascendancy over the immediate 
urges' of my tortured sense of 
extreme disgust. Be wise, say I, 
knowing I request the impossible, 
and irk me no more!" 

" 'Y God, I reckon you don't 
think you rile me up, too, with 
all that high falutin* jabber of 
yours!" Jacob snapped back. 

"As I speak, so speak the 
mighty Zoz," replied the Weapon 
in high dignity. "They are great 
and noble beings, given to poetic 
flights and magnificent deeds. To 
them, your puny opinions would 
not even be recognized as 
thought." 

"If they talk in that puttin'on, play-actin' way you do, they 
are % bunch of phony show-offin' 
hypocrites!" sulked Jacob. 

Several things happened too 
quickly for Jacob to follow. The 
color of the energy globe dropped to absolute black. The metallic cylinder swung up to point at 
Jacob. A thin ringing "Ping!" 
sounded in the cylinder. A killing 
wave of pure hate struck Jacob. 

He had just enough time to 
know he was a dead man before 
he blacked out. 

IT came as a surprise, when 
-1 Jacob regained consciousness, 
to find that he was stretched out 
on purple grass with the Weapon 
still hovering over him. 



"You missed, 'y God !" he 
mumbled, sitting up. 

"I regained my sanity in time. 
Master Technician," the Weapon 
replied pleasantly, 

"Huh?" 

"Ah, day of uncontainable 
joy!" sang the Weapon, flaming 
pure white. "Day of glorious release to continue the grandeur 
of old! As the past eons of futility passed over me, I sank to 
the conclusion that I was forever 
condemned to my useless existence on this planet, with nothing 
to sustain my spirit other than 
the sense of beauty given me by 
masters to fill my leisure hours! 
But now, Master Technician Jacob, you have found me and corrected my malfunction, long after 
I had surrendered all hope!" 

Still dazed by the nearly fatal 
wave of mental energy the Weapon had directed at him, Jacob 
could not understand what had 
happened. Instead of talking contemptuously to htm, the Weapon 
was now addressing him as Master Something-or-other, and . . . 

"What did you say I done?" 
he asked. 

"You corrected my malfunction," repeated the Weapon. 
"That is to say, you purged 
my mechanism of the inhibition 
against joyful slaughter that has 
plagued me for a billion years. 
Ah, you are a clever Technician, 
Jacob! But I comprehend it all

now. By arousing within me an 
overwhelming emotional desire to 
kill — a singularly strange feeling! 
— you depressed my inhibition to 
the releasing point. So telling was 
your masterful therapy that I 
almost ceased functioning at all! 

"Your own life was in dire 
danger for the moment required 
for my new-found sanity to assume control. But, of course, all 
slaves of the glorious Zoz die willingly when the work of the masters so demands." 

"Now wait a minute!" objected 
Jacob. "I ain't no slave of your 
Zozes or no Technician either! 
You know what I am — a good 
God-fearin' human !" His voice 
dropped to a pleading mumble. 
"And may God forgive me if I've 
got myself in league with the 
Devil !" 

"Ah? Could it be?" murmured 
the Weapon. "Could indeed your 
infuriating insults of the Great 
Ones have been *honest expressions of a puny mind with no 
therapeutic intentions? I answer: 
Yes. The possible occurrence of 
specific incidents in the inclusion 
of space-time is curiously unlimited. But you have served me, 
Jacob, and have earned the privilege of continuing your meager, 
momentary life. Besides, I can 
use you further." 

"You can, huh?" Jacob said 
slyly. "Look here, Weapon, I'll 
make a bargain with you." 



"Ha! Stupid, untutored slave!" 
chuckled the Weapon. "Learn 
that yours is to obey, not to bargain. But yet, state your price 
for my amusement, now that I 
can no longer be enraged by 
your words." 

"Well, you let the rest of the 
people on Earth alone and I'll do 
whatever you want me to." 

After a pause, the Weapon 
quoted, " 'Nobility shows its traces 
in surprising places.' You do not 
sufficiently comprehend my nature, Technician Slave Jacob. I 
am a Weapon. My masters point 
me, as you would point a rifle, 
and command that I destroy. I 
kill at their direction, but seldom 
otherwise. Thus, your Terra is 
safe until another Weapon or I 
am aimed and directed. You can 
make no bargain." 

Jacob thought this over. While 
doing so, the Weapon drifted 
away. 

"Wait here, slave," it said in 
parting. "I go to meditate on my 
recovered sanity." 

^|URING the next two days, 
Jacob caught an occasional 
glimpse of the Weapon drifting 
thoughtfully around in the depths 
of the forest, but they did not 
meet for conversation. Jacob 
amused himself by rigging a fishing line out of some of the pack- I 
aging material that contained his 
food. He even succeeded in catch


THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



ing a fish, but its queer odor discouraged him from trying to cook 
and eat it. 

Then the royal cruiser of Tresqu the Wisest dropped into the 
meadow. Its airlock swung open 
and the Ruler of Hova, followed 
by his entourage, came out. 

"Oh, Mighty Weapon!" bawled 
Tresqu. "Your loving servant 
craves audience!" 

"Ah, you have returned, petty 
lord," said the Weapon, drifting 
out from among the trees. "Serve 
me by calling all the crew members from your noble ship, that 
I may view you all together." 

Puzzled, Tresqu bowed and 
said, "Your least whim is law, 
Mighty Weapon." He turned and 
called, "All hands, outside!" 

A^ half-dozen Hovans tumbled 
through the lock to stand in line 
behind the ruler's entourage. 

"Is this all of them?" asked 
the Weapon. 

"All, Great Mentor of — " 

The Weapon laughed and the 
Hovans fell dead. 

"Come, Slave Jacob," commanded the Weapon. "We take 
this cruiser." 

Dazed and slack-faced, Jacob 
came out from behind a bush, 
where he had hidden himself from 
the Hovans, and followed the 
Weapon through the airlock. 

"Even in my insanity, I planned well," said the Weapon. 
"These ships, which I taught the 



Hovans to construct, can be operated simply, even by such as you. 
Attend my instructions." 

First, the Weapon taught Jacob to open and close the airlock. Then he was shown how to 
fuel the engines, upon which the 




Weapon made some changes to 
improve their performance. Finally, in the control room, Jacob 
learned to fly the ship. 

This took several hours, at the 
end of which time Jacob had succeeded in raising the cruiser into 
a satellite orbit around Hova. 

"Do you comprehend. Slave?"

asked the Weapon. 

"Sure. This thing ain't nothin' 
to run compared to a T-model 
Ford! Which way is it to Earth?" 

"That I shall not tell you, 
Jacob, because I must leave the 
ship for a few hours and desire 
to find you here when I return. 
Consider and tell me: Will you 
be here?" 

Jacob gazed at the broad, starspangled viewplate that curved 
around his seat at the controls. 
There was, he reflected an awful 
lot of nothing out there for a 
man to get lost in. 

"I'll be here," he promised. 

"Very good. You must understand that these controls are constructed for manipulation by such 
limbs as your own and those of 
the Hovans. Thus, it is convenient 
for me to use you as a pilot instead of doing the drab, mechanical task with my ill-suited forcefield manipulators. You will be 
wise to serve me well, Jacob." 

Jacob nodded. "You got a point 
there." 

"Operate the lock for me," the 
Weapon ordered. 

Jacob did so and watched the 
colorful machine drift out of 
sight in the atmosphere below the 
cruiser. 

Minutes ticked quietly by as 
Jacob gazed down at the purple 
planet and wondered why the 
Weapon had not chosen a trained 
Hovan pilot instead of him. Also, 



he wondered how soon the Weapon would take him home to 
Earth. 

A great swath of the purple 
planet began turning black. The 
black dulled to the gray shade of 
ashes as the swath grew longer. 
Over the surface of Hova, the 
blackening moved like some colossal paint brush. D£nse clouds 
of smoke rolled upward to the 
high reaches of the atmosphere. 

Jacob realized why the Weapon 
had not selected a Hovan pilot. 

When all of Hova was a lifeless ball in a fog of ash, the Weapon returned. 

'"Ah, good Jacob!" it boomed 
jovially. "Let us be up and doing! 
Thirty-six planets remain to be 
visited before my current assignment is concluded!" 

"Do all of them get — that?" 
asked Jacob, nodding toward the 
lifeless world below. 

"Yes. I was instructed to render this solar system lifeless before I malfunctioned. Since then, 
the life of this system has spread, 
with my insane aid, to infest 
other systems. Of course, my task 
must now include all. those new 
Hovan worlds." 

"Now wait a minute!" said 
Jacob in terror. "I can't let you 
do that!" 

"They are your enemies, Jacob," reminded the Weapon. 
"They meant to kill every human on Terra. Also, by your own 



THE RELUCTANT WEAPON 



words, they are soulless animals 
who live in sinful adultery. Ha! 
It amuses me to reason with you, 
Slave Jacob!" 

"Godamighty, forgive me!" 
prayed Jacob, in horrified defeat. 

* I ''HE Weapon seemed to know 
how to find the Hovan planets 
from the markings of the cruiser's 
star charts. Jacob could not read 
the charts and saw no hope of 
getting back to earth and Suzy 
and the kids without the Weapon's help. Dully, he went about 
the tasks the Weapon ordered him 
to do. 

Several weeks passed as one 
world after another was left a 
smoking ruin. 

Finally the job was done. 
% "Now, can I go home?" begged 
Jacob. 

"To Terra? No, Slave. I still 
need a pilot." 

"But if you take me home," 
Jacob continued desperately, 
"you can" get a better" pilot than 
me. I'm just a dirt farmer. 
There's all kinds of airplane pilots on Earth, youngsters without families who would give their 
right arms to fly this thing, I 
bet!" 

"Ah?" The Weapon considered. 
"A willing slave is, of course, 
always desirable. On the other 



hand, Terra is up in arms against 
the empire of Hova, not realizing 
it is dead. They would destroy 
this craft on sight, and I would 
be obliged to wait around until 
they could construct another for 
me. No, I have decided we will 
not go to Terra." 

"But, damn it> where else is 
there to go?" 

"In search of my masters of 
Zoz," replied the Weapon. "Naturally, I wish to return myself 
to their services as soon as possible." 

"But they might be anywhere!" 

"True," the Weapon agreed. 
"But even after a billion years, 
I know of several places in the 
Universe they may be near. Their 
great cleansing sweeps tend to 
circle and turn in a pattern established long in advance. Thus we 
will go to those places where 
they may now be engaged in 
their consecrated task of universal purification." 

"But—" 

"No more, Slave! We go!" 

Out'of the Milky Way, the 
cruiser hurtled at a speed which 
a sentient lightwave would find 
meaningless. On and on they 
journeyed in quest of the longdead Zoz Horde. 

They may still be going.
