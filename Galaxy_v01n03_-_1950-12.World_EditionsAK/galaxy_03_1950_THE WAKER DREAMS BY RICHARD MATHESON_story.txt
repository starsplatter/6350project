THE WAKER DREAMS BY RICHARD MATHESON 

IF ONE flew over the city at 
this time of this day, which was 
like any other day in the year 
3850, one would think all life had 
disappeared. 

Sweeping over the rustless spires, 
one would search in vain for the 
sight of human activity. One's gaze 
would scan the great ribboned 
highways that swept over and under each other like the weave of 
some tremendous loom. But there 
would be no autocars to see; nothing but the empty lanes and the 
colored traffic lights clicking out 
their mindless progressions. 



Dipping low and weaving in and 
out among the glittering towers, 
one might see the moving walks, 
the studied revolution of the giant 
street ventilators, hot in the winter 
and cool in summer, the tiny doors 
opening and closing, the park 
fountains shooting their methodical 
columns of water into the air. 

Farther along, one would flit 
across the great open field on which 
the glossy spaceships stood lined 
before their hangars. Farther yet, 
one would catch sight of the river, 
the metal ships resting along shore, 
delicate froth streaming from their

sterns caused by the never-ending 
operation of their vents. 

Again, one would glide over the 
city proper, seeking some sign of 
life in the broad avenues, the network of streets, the painstaking 
pattern of dwellings in the living 
area, the metal fastness of the commercial section. 

The search would be fruitless. 

All movement below would be 
seen to be mechanical. And, knowing what city this was, one's eyes 
would stop the search for citizens 
and seek out those squat metal 
structures which stood a half mile 
apart. These circular buildings 
housed the never-resting machines, 
the humming geared servants of 
the city's people. 

These were the machines that 
did all; cleared the air of impurities, moved the walks and opened 
the doors, sent their synchronized 
impulses into the traffic lights, 
operated the fountains and the 
spaceships, the river vessels and 
the ventilatoss. 

These were the machines in 
whose flawless efficacy the people 
> of the city placed their casual faith. 

At the moment, these people 
were resting on their pneumatic 
couches in rooms. And the music 
that seeped from their wall speakers, the cool breezes that flowed 
from their wall ventilators, the very 
air they breathed — all these were 
of and from the machines, the unfailing, the trusted, the infallible 
machines. 



Now there was a buzzing in ears. 
Now the city came alive. 

THERE was a buzzing, buzzing. 
From the black swirl of slumber, you heard it. You wrinkled up 
your classic nose and twitched the 
twenty neural rods that led to the 
highways of your extremities. 

The sound bore deeper, cut 
through swaths of snooze and 
poked an impatient finger in the 
throbbing matter of your brain. 
You twisted your head on the pillow and grimaced. 

There was no cessation. With 
stupored hand, you reached out and 
picked up the receiver. One eye 
propped open by dint of will, you 
breathed a weary mutter into the 
mouthpiece. 

"Captain Rackley!" The knifing 
voice put your teeth on edge. 
"Yes," you said. 
"You will report to your company headquarters immediately!" 

That swept away sleep and annoyance as a petulant old man 
brushes chessmen from his board. 
Stomach muscles drew into play 
and you were sitting. Inside your 
noble chest, that throbbing meat 
ball, source of blood velocity, saw 
fit to swell and depress with 
marked emphasis. Your sweat 
glands engaged in proper activity, 
ready for action, danger, heroism. 
"Is it . . .?" you started. 
"Report immediately!" the voice 
crackled, and there was a severe 
click in your ear. 



94 




 



You, Justin Rackley, dropped the 
receiver — plunko — in its cradle and 
leaped from bed in a shower of 
fluttering bedclothes. 

You raced to your wardrobe door 
and flung it open. Plunging into 
the depths, you soon emerged with 
your skintight pants, the tunic for 
your forty-two chest. You donned 
said trousers and tunic, flopped 
upon a nearby seat and plunged 
your arches into black military 
boots. 

AND your face reflected oh-sogrim thoughts. Combing out 
your thick blond hair, you were 
sure you knew what the emergency 
was. 

The Rustons! They were at it 
again ! 

Awake now, you wrinkled your 
nose with conscious aplomb. The 
Rustons made revolting food for 
thought with their twelve legs, 
sign of alien progenitors, and their 
exudation of foul reptilian slime. 

As you scurried 'from your room, 
leaped across the balustrade and 
down the stairs, you wondered once 
again where these awful Rustons 
had originated, what odious interbreeding produced their monster 
race. You wondered where they 
lived, where proliferated their grisly stock, held their meetings of 
war, began the upward slither to 
those great Earth fissures from 
which they massed in attack. 

With nothing approaching answers to these endless questions, 



you ran out of the dwelling and 
flew down the steps to your faithful autocar. Sliding in, pushing 
buttons, levers, pedals, what have 
you, you soon had it darting 
through the streets toward the 
broad highway that led to headquarters. 

At this time of day, naturally, 
there were very few people about. 
In point of fact you saw none. It 
was only a few minutes later, when 
you turned sharply and zoomed up 
the ramp to the highway, that you 
saw the other autocars whizzing toward the tower five miles distant. 
You guessed, and were correct in 
guessing, that they were fellow 
officers, all similarly ripped from 
slumber by mobilization. 

Buildings flew past as you 
pushed pedals deeper into their 
cavities, your face always grim, 
alive to danger, grand warrior ! 
True, you were not averse to the 
chance for activity after a month 
of idleness. But the circumstances 
were slightly distasteful. To think 
of the Rustons made a fellow 
shudder, eh? 

What made them pour from 
their unknown pits? Why did they 
seek to destroy the machines, let 
the acid canker of their ooze eat 
through metal, make the teeth fall 
off the gears like petals off a dying 
flower? What was their purpose? 
Did they mean to ruin the city? 
Govern its inhabitants ? Or slaughter them? Ugly questions, questions without answers. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



Well, you thought as you drove 
into headquarters parking area, 
thank heaven the Rustons had only 
managed to get at a few of the 
outer machines, yours blessedly not 
included. 

They, at least, had no more idea 
than you where the Great Machine 
was, that fabulous fountainhead of 
energy, driver of all machines. 

You slid the seat of your military 
trousers across the seat of the autocar and jumped out into the wide 
lot. Your black boots clacked as 
you ran toward the entrance. Other 
officers were getting out of autocars, too, running across the area. 
None of them said anything; they 
all looked grim. Some of them 
nodded curtly at you as you all 
stood together in the rising elevator. Bad business, you thought. 

With a tug at the groin, the 
door gave a hydraulic gasp and 
opened. You stepped out and 
padded silently down the hall to 
the high-ceilinged briefing room. 

Already the room was almost 
filled. The young men, invariably 
handsome and muscular, stood in 
gregarious formations, discussing ' 
the Rustons in low voices. The gray 
soundproof walls sucked in their 
comments and returned dead air. 

THE men gave you a look and a 
nod when you entered, then returned to their talking. Justin Rackley, captain, that"s you, sat down 
in a front seat. 

Then you looked up. The door 



to Upper Echelons was. jerked 
open. The General came striding 
through, a sheaf of papers in his 
square fist. His face was grim too. 

He stepped up on the rostrum 
and slapped the papers on the thick 
table which stood there. Then he 
plumped down on the edge of it 
and kicked his boot against one of 
its legs until all your fellow officers 
had broken up their groups and 
hurriedly taken seats. With silence 
creeping over all heads, he pursed 
his lips and banged a palm on the 
table surface. 

"Gentlemen," he said with that 
voice which seemed to issue from 
an ancient tomb, "once more the 
city lies in grave danger." 

He then paused and looked 
capable of handling all emergencies. You hoped that someday you 
might be General and look capable of handling all emergencies. No 
reason why not, you thought. 

"I will not take up precious 
time," the General went on, taking 
up precious time. "You all know 
your positions, you all know your 
responsibilities. When this briefing 
is concluded, you will report to the 
arsenal and draw out your ray guns. 
Always remember that the Rustons 
must not be allowed to enter the 
machinery and live. Shoot to kill. 
The rays are not harmful, repeat, 
not harmful to the machinery." 

He looked over you eager young 
men. 

"You also know," he said, "the 
dangers of Ruston poisoning. For 



96 




 



this reason, that the slightest touch 
of their stingers can lead to abysmal agonies of death, you will be 
assigned, as you also know, a nurse 
trained in the combating of syST 
temic poisons. Therefore, after 
leaving the arsenal, you will report 
to the Preventive Section." 

He winked, a thoroughly out-ofplace wink. 

"And remember," he said, with 
a broad roll of import in his voice, 
"this is war! And only war!" 

This, of course, brought on appreciative smiles, a smattering of 
leers and many unmilitary asides. 
Upon which the General snapped 
out of his brief role as chuckling 
confrere and returned to strict autocratic detachment. 

"Once assigned a nurse, those of 
you whose machines are more than 
fifteen miles from the city will report to the spaceport, there to be 
assigned a spacecar. All of you will 
then proceed with utmost dispatch. 
Questions?" 

No questions. 

"I need hardly remind you," 
completed the General, "of the importance of this defense. As you 
are well aware, should the Rustons 
penetrate our city, spread their ravaging to the core of our machine 
system, should they — heaven forfend ! — locate the Great Machine, 
wc may then expect nothing but 
the most merciless of butchery. The 
city would be undone, we would all 
be annihilated, Man would be overthrown." 



THE men looked at him with 
clenched fists, patriotism lurching through their brains like 
drunken satyrs, yours included, 
Justin Rackley. 

"That is all," said the General, 
waving his hand. "Good shooting." 

He jumped down from the platform and swept through the doorway, the door opening magically a 
split second before his imperious 
nose stood to shatter on its surface. 

You stood up, muscles tingling. 
Onward! Save our fair city! 

You stepped through the broken 
ranks. The elevator again, standing 
shoulder to shoulder with your 
comrades, a fluttering sense of 
hyper-awareness coursing your 
healthy young body. 

The arsenal room. Sound lost in 
the heavily padded interior. You, 
on line, grim-faced always, shuffling 
along, weapon bound. A counter; it 
was like an exchange market. You 
showed the man your identity card 
and he handed you a shiny ray gun 
and a shoulder case of extra ray 
pellets. 

Then you passed through the 
door and scuffed down the rubberized steps' to the Preventive Section. 
Corpuscles took a carnival ride 
through your veins. 

You were fourth in line and she 
was fourth in line; that's how she 
jsvas assigned to you. 

You perused her contours, notiitftg 1 - that her uniform, although 
similar to yours, somehow hung 
differently on her. This sidetracked 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



martial contemplations for the 
nonce. Zotvie hoopla — your libido 
clapped its calloused hands. 

"Captain Rackley," said the man, 
"this is Miss Lieutenant Forbes. 
She is your only guarantee against 
death should you be stung by a 
Ruston. See that she remains close 
by at all times." 

This seemed hardly an onerous 
commission and you saluted the 
man. You then exchanged a flicker 
of lids with the young lady and 
intoned a gruff command, relative 
to departure. This roused the two 
of you to walk to the elevator. 

Riding down in silence, you cast 
glances at her. Long forgotten 
threnodies twitched into life in 
your revitalized brain. You were 
much taken by the dark ringlets 
that hung over her forehead and 
massed on her shoulders like 
curled black fingers. Her eyes, you 
noted, were brown and soft as eyes 
in a dream. And why shouldn't 
they be? 

Yet something lacked. Some retardation kept bringing you down 
from ethereal cogitation. Could it, 
you wondered, be duty? And, remembering what you were out to 
do, you suddenly feared again. The 
pink clouds marched away in military formation. 

Miss Lieutenant Forbes remained silent until the spacecar 
which you were assigned was flitting across the sky beyond the outskirts of the city. Then, following 
your somewhat banal overtures re


garding the weather, she smiled 
her pretty little smile and showed 
her pretty little dimples. 

"I am but sixteen," she announced. 

"Then this is your first time." 

"Yes," she replied, gazing afar. 
"I am very frightened." 

You nodded, you patted her 
knee with what you meant to be a 
parental manner, but which, posthaste, brought the crimson of modesty flaming into her cheeks. 

"Just stay close to me," you said, 
trying hard for a double meaning. 
"I'll take care of you." 

Primitive, but good enough for 
sixteen. She blushed more deeply. 

The city towers flashed beneath. 
Far off, like a minute button on 
the fringes of spiderweb, you saw 
your machine. You eased the wheel 
forward; the tiny ship dipped down 
and began a long glide toward 
Earth. You kept your eyes on the 
control board with strict attention, 
wondering about this strange sense 
of excitement running pell mell 
through your body, not knowing 
whether it presaged combat fatigue 
of one sort or another. 

This was war. The city first. 
Hola! 

THE ship floated down to and 
hovered over the machine as 
you threw on the air brakes. Slowly, it sank to the roof like a butterfly settling on a flower. 

You threw off the switch, heart 
pounding, all forgotten but the 




 



present danger. Grabbing the ray 
gun, you jumped out and ran to the 
edge of the roof. 

Your machine was beyond the 
perimeter of the city. There were 
fields about. Your keen eyes flashed 
over the ground. 

There was no sign of the enemy. 

You hurried back to the ship. 
She was still sitting inside watching you. You turned the knob and 
the communicator system spilled 
out its endless drones of information. You stood impatiently until 
the announcer spoke your machine 
number and said the Rustons were 
within a mile of it. 

You heard her drawn-in breath 
and noted the upward cast of 
frightened eyes in your direction. 
You turned off the set. 

"Come, we'll , go inside," you 
said, holding the ray gun in a delightfully shaking hand. It was fun 
to be frightened. A fine sense of 
living dangerously. Wasn't that 
why you were here? 

You helped her out. Her hand 
was cold. You squeezed it and gave 
her a half smile of confidence. 
Then, locking the door to the 
spacecar, to keep the foe out, you 
took her arm and the two of you 
went down the stairs. As you entered the main room, your head 
was at once filled with the smooth 
hum of machinery. 

Here, at this juncture of the adventure, you put down your ray 
gun and ammunition and explained 
the machinery to hsr. It is to be 



noted that you had no particular 
concern for the machinery as you 
spoke, being more aware of her 
proximity. Such charm, such youth, 
crying out for comfort. 

You soon held her hand again. 
Then you had your arm around her 
lithesome waist and she was close. 
Something other than military defense planned itself in your mind. 

Came the moment when she 
flicked up her drowsy lids and 
looked you smack-dab in the eye, 
as is the archaic literary passage. 
You found her violet eyes somewhat unbalancing. You drew her 
closer. The perfume of her rosy 
breath tied casual knots in your 
limbs. And yet there was still something holding you back. 

Swish! Slap! 

She stiffened and cried out. 
The Rustons were at the walls ! 

YOU raced for the table upon 
which your ray gun rested. On 
the couch next to the table was 
your ammunition. You slung the 
case over your shoulder. She ran 
up to you and, sternly, you handed 
her the preventive case. You felt 
like the self-assured General when 
he was in a grim mood. 

"Keep the needles loaded and 
handy," you said. "I may . . ." 

The sentence died as another 
great slobbering Ruston slapped 
against the wall. The sound of its 
huge suckers slurped on the outside. They were searching for the 
machinery in the basement. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



99 



You checked the gun. It was 
ready. 

"Stay here," you muttered. "I 
have to go down." 

You didn't hear what she said. 
You dashed down the stairs and 
came bouncing out into the basement just as the first horror gushed 
over the edge of a window onto its 
metal floor like a stream of gravitydefying lava. 

THE row of blinking yellow eyes 
turned on you; your flesh 
crawled. The great brown-gold 
monstrosity began to scuttle across 
toward the machines with an oily 
squish. You almost froze in fear. 

Then instinct came to the fore. 
You raised the gun quickly. A 
crackling brilliantinc blue ray 
leaped from the muzzle, touched 
the scaly body and enveloped it. 
Screeching and the smell of frying 
oil filled the air. When the ray had 
dissipated, the dead Ruston lay 
black and smoking on the floor, its 
slime running across the welded 
seams. 

You heard the sound of suckers 
behind. You whirled, blasted the 
second of the Rustons into greasy 
oblivion. Still another slid over the 
window edge and started toward 
you. Another burst from the gun 
and another scorched hulk lay 
twitching on the metal. 

You swallowed a great lump of 
excitement in your throat, your 
head snapping around, your body 
leaping from side to side. In a sec


ond, two more of them were moving toward you. Two bursts of ray, 
one missed. The second monster 
was almost upon you before you 
burst it into flaming chunks as it 
reared up to plunge its black stingers in your chest. 

You turned quickly, cried out in 
horror. 

One Ruston was just slipping 
down the stairs, another swishing 
toward you, the long stingers 
aimed at your heart. You pressed 
the button. A scream caught in 
your throat. 

You were out of pellets! 

You leaped to the side and the 
Ruston fell forward. You tore 
open the case and fumbled with 
the pellets. One fell and shattered 
uselessly on the metal. Your hands 
were ice, they shook terribly. The 
blood pounded through your veins, 
your hair stood on end. You felt 
scared and amused. 

The Ruston lunged again as you 
slid the pellet into the ray gun. 
You dodged again — not enough! 
The end of one stinger slashed 
through your tunic, laid open your 
arm. You felt the burning poison 
shoot into your system. 

You pressed the button and the 
monster disappeared in a cloud of 
unguent, smoke. The basement machinery was secure against attack — 
the Rustons had bypassed it. 

You leaped for the stairway. 
You had to save the machines, save 
her, save yourself! 

Your boots banged up the metal 



TOO 




 



chairs. You lunged into the great 
room of machines and swept a 
glance around. 

A gasp tore open your mouth. 
She was collapsed on a couch, 
sprawled, inert. A Ruston line of 
slime ran down the front of her 
swelling tunic. 

You whirled and, as you did, the 
Ruston vanished into the machinery, pushing its scaly body through 
the gear spaces. The slime dropped 
from its body and watery jaws. The 
machine stopped, started again, the 
racked wheels groaning. 

THE city! You leaped to the machine's edge and shot a blast 
from the ray gun into it. The brilliantine blue ray licked out, missed 
the Ruston. You fired again. The 
Ruston moved too fast, hid behind 
the wheels. You ran around the 
machine, kept on firing. 

You glanced at her. How long 
did the poison take? They never 
said. Already in your flesh, howe\er, the burning had begun. You 
felt as if you were going up in 
flames, as if great pieces of your 
body were about to fall off. 

You had to get an injection for 
yourself and her. 

Still the Ruston eluded you. You 
had to stop and put another pellet 
in the gun. The interior began to 
whirl around you; you were overpoweririgly dizzy. You pressed the 
button again and again. The ray 
darted into the machine. 

You reeled around with a sob 



and tore open your collar. You 
could hardly breathe. The smell of 
the singed suet, of the rays, filled 
your head. You stumbled around 
the machine, shot out another ray 
at the fast-moving Ruston. 

Then, finally, when you were 
about to keel over, you got a good 
target. You pressed the button, the 
Ruston was enveloped in flame, fell 
in " molten bits beneath the machine, was swallowed up by the 
waste exhaust. 

You dropped the ray gun and 
staggered over to her. 

The hypodermics were on the 
table. 

You tore open her tunic and 
jabbed a needle into her soft white 
shoulder, shudderingly injected the 
antidote into her veins. You stuck 
another into your own shoulder, 
felt the sudden coolness run 
through your flesh and your bloodstream. 

You sank down beside her, 
breathing heavily and closing your 
eyes. The violence of activity had 
exhausted you. You felt as though 
you would have to rest a month 
after this. And, of course, you 
would. 

She groaned. You opened your 
eyes and looked at her. Your heavy 
breathing began again, but this 
time you knew where the excitement was coming from. You kept 
looking at her. A warm heat 
lapped at your limbs, caressed your 
heart. Her eyes were on you. 

"I . . ." you said. 



THE WAKER DREAMS 



101 



Then all holding back was ended, all doubt undone. The city, the 
Rustons, the machines — the danger 
was over and forgotten. She ran a 
caressing hand over your cheek. 

(i \ ND when next you opened 

-ix your eyes," finished the doctor, "you were back in this room." 

Rackley laughed, his head quivering on the pillow, his hands 
twitching in glee. 

"But my dear doctor," he 
laughed, "how fantastically clever 
of you to know everything. However do you do it, naughty man?" 

The doctor looked down at the 
tall handsome man who lay on the 
bed, still shaking with breathless 
laughter. 

"You forget," he said, "I inject 
you. Quite natural that I should 
know what happens then." 

"Oh, quite! Quite!" cried Justin 
Rackley. "Oh, it was utterly, utterly fantastic. Imagine me!" He ran 
strong fingers over the swelling biceps of his arm. "Me, a hero!" 

He clapped his hands together 
and deep laughter rumbled in his 
chest, his white teeth flashed against 
the glowing tan of his face. The 
sheet slipped, revealing the broad 
suppleness of his chest, the tightly 
ridged stomach muscles. 

"Oh, dear me," he sighed. "Dear 
me, what would this dull existence 
be without your blessed injections' 
to ease our endless boredom?" ' 

The doctor looked coldly at him, 
his strong white fingers tightening 



into a bloodless fist. The thoughtplunged a cruel knife into his brain 
— this is the end of our race, the 
sorry peak of Man's evolution. This 
is the final corruption. 

Rackley yawned and stretched 
his arms. "I must rest." He peered 
up at the doctor. "It was such a 
fatiguing dream." 

He began to giggle, his great 
blond head lolling on the pillow. 
His hands striking at the sheet as 
though he would die of amusement. 

"Do tell me," he gasped, "what 
on earth have you in those utterly 
delightful injections? I've asked 
you so often." 

The doctor picked up his plastic 
bag. "Merely a combination of 
chemicals designed to exacerbate 
the adrenals on one hand and, on 
the other, to inhibit the higher 
brain centers. In short," he finished, "a potpourri of intensification and reduction." 

"Oh, you always say that," said 
Justin Rackley. "But it is delightful. Utterly, charmingly delightful. 
You will be back in a month for 
my next dream and my dream playback?" 

The doctor blew out a weary 
gust of breath. "Yes," he said, 
making no effort to veil his disgust. 
" "I'll be back next month." 

"Thank heavens," said Rackley, 
"I'm done with that awful Ruston 
dream for another five months. 
Ugh! It's so frightfully vile! I like 
the pleasanter dreams about mining 



102 




 



and transporting ores from Mars 
and the Moon, and the adventures 
in food centers. They're so much 
nicer. But . . ." His lips twitched. 
"Do have more of those pretty 
young girls in them." 

His strong, weary body twisted 
in delight. 

"Oh, do," he murmured, his eyes 
shutting. 

He sighed and turned slowly 
and exhaUstedly onto his broad, 
muscular side. 

THE doctor walked through the 
deserted streets, his face tight 
with the old frustration. Why? 
Why? His mind kept repeating the 
word. 

Why must we continue to sustain life in the cities? For what 
purpose? Why do we not let civilization in its last outpost die as it 
means to die? Why struggle to 
keep such men alive? 

Hundreds, thousands of Justin 
Rackleys — well kept animals, mechanically bred and fed and massaged into fair and handsome form. 
Mechanically restrained, too, from 
physically turning into the fat 
white slugs that, mentally, they already were and would bodily resemble if left untended. Or die. 

Why not let them? Why visit 
them every month, fill their veins 
with hypnotic drugs and sit back 
and watch them, one by one, go 
bursting into, their dream worlds 
to escape botedom? Must he endlessly send his suggestions into 



their loosened brainways, fly them 
to planets and moons, crowd all 
forms of love and grand adventure 
into their mock-heroic dreams? 

The doctor slumped tiredly and 
went into another dorm-building. 
More figures, strongly or beautifully made, passive on couches. 
More dream injections. 

He made them, watched the figures stand and stumble to the wardrobes. Explorers' outfits this time, 
pith helmets and attractive shorts, 
snake boots and bared limbs. He 
stood at the window, saw them 
clamber into their autocars and 
drive away. He sat back and waited 
for them to return, knowing every 
move they would make, because he 
made them in his mind. 

They would go out to the hydroponics tanks and fight off an invasion of Energy Eaters. Bigger 
than the Rustons and made of pure 
force, they threatened to suck the 
sustenance from the plants in the 
growing trays, the living, formless 
meat swelling immortally in the nutrient solutions. The Energy Eaters 
would be beaten off, of course. 
They always were. 

Naturally. They were only 
dreams. Creatures of fantastic illusion, conjured in eager dreaming 
minds by chemical magic and 
dreary scientific incantation. 

But what would all these Justin 
cRackleys say, these handsome and 
('hopeless ruins of torpid flesh, if 
they found out how they were being fooled? 



104 




 



Found out that the Rustons were 
only mental fictions for objectifying simple rust and wear and converting them into fanciful monsters. Monsters which alone could 
feebly arouse the dim instinct for 
self-preservation which just barely 
existed in this lost race. Energy 
Eaters — beetles and spores and exhausted growth solutions. Mine 
Borers — vaporous beasties that had 
to be blasted out of the Lunar and 
Martian metal deposits. And others, still others, all of them threats 
to that which runs and feeds and 
renews a city. 

And what would they say, these 
Justin Rackleys, upon the discovery 
that each of them, in their 
"dreams," had d'one genuine manual work ? That their ray guns were 
spray guns or grease guns or air 
hammers, their death rays no more 
than streams of lubrication for rusting machines or insecticides or 
liquid fertilizer? 

What would they say if they 
found out how they were tricked 
into breeding with aphrodisiacs in 
the guise of anti-poison shots? 
How they, with no healthy interest 
in procreation, were drugged into 
the furtherance of their spineless 
strain, a strain whose only function 
was to sustain the life-giving machines. 

IN A month he would return to 
Justin Rackley, Captain Justin 
Rackley. A month for rest, these 
people were so devoid of energy. 



It took a month to build up even 
enough strength to endure an injection of hypnotics, to oil a machine or tend a tray, and to bring 
forth one puny cell of life. 

All for the machines, the city, 
for man . . . 

The doctor spat on the immaculate floor of the room with the 
pneumatic couches. 

The people were the machines, 
more than the machines themselves. 
A slave race, a detestable residue, 
hopeless, without hope. 

Oh, how they would wail and 
swoon, he thought, getting grim 
pleasure in the notion, were they 
allowed to walk through that vast 
subterranean tunnel to the giant 
chamber where the Great Machine 
stood, that supposed source of all 
energy, and saw why they had to 
be tricked into working. The Great 
Machine had been designed to 
eliminate all human labor, tending 
the minor machines, the food 
plants, the mining. 

But some wise one on the Control Council, centuries before, had 
had the wit to smash the Great 
Machine's mechanical brain. And 
now the Justin Rackleys would have 
to see, with their own unbelieving 
eyes, the rust, the rot, the giant 
twisted death of it. . . . But they 
wouldn't. 

. Their job was to dream of adventurous work, and work while 
dreaming. 

For how long?
