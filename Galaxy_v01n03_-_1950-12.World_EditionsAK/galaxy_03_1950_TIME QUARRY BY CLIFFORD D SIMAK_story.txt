TIME QUARRY BY CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 

Tricked by a smooth character from 500 years ahead 
in time. 



Tricked by a letter from 6,000 
years out of the past. 

Tricked, groaned Sutton, by my 
own muddle-headedness. 



He sat up and held his head in 
his hands and felt the westering 
Sun against his back, heard the 
squalling of a catbird in the blackberry patch and the sound of the 
wind as it ran along the corn rows. 

Tricked and trapped, he said 
through his teeth. 

He took his hands frofn his head 
and there in the trampled grass lay 
the wrench with the blood on it. 
Sutton spread out his fingers and 
blood was on them, too . . , warm 
and sticky blood. Gingerly he 
touched his head with a cautious 
hand and his hair was wet and 
matted down. 

Pattern, he said viciously. It all 
runs in a pattern. 

Here I am and there is the 
wrench and just beyond the fence 
is the field of corn that is better 
than knee high on this splendid 
afternoon of July 4,- 1977. 

The ship from the 'future is gone 
and in another hour or so John H. 
Sutton will come waddling down 
the hill to ask the questions that he 
forgot to ask before. And ten years 
from now he will write a letter and 
in it he will record his suspicions 
about me and I will be in the farm 
yard at that very moment pumping 
a drink. 

Sutton staggered to his feet and 
stood in the empty afternoon, with 
the sweep of sky above the horizon 
of the ridge and the panorama of 
the winding river far down the 
slope below. 

He touched the wrench with his

toe and thought: I could break the 
pattern. I could take the wrench 
and then John H. would never find 
it, and, with one thing in the pattern changed, the end might not be 
the same. 

I read the letter wrong, he 
thought. I always figured it would 
be the other man, not me. It never 
once occurred to me that it was my 
blood upon the wrench and that I 
would be the one who would steal 
the clothes off the line. 

And yet he realized there were 
certain things that didn't track. He 
still had his clothes and there would 
be no need to steal. His ship still 
was resting on the river's bottom 
and there was no need to stay in 
the past. 

Yet it had happened once before, 
for if it had not happened, why had 
there been the letter? The letter 
had made him come here and the 
letter had been written because he 
had come, so he must have come 
before. And in that other time he'd 
stayed . . » and stayed only because 
he could not get away. This time he 
would go back; this time he need 
not stay. 

A second chance, he thought. 
I've been given another chance. 

Yet that wasn't right, for if there 
had been a second time, old John 
H. would have known about it. . 
And there couldn't be a second 
time, for this was the very day that 
John H. had talked to the man out i 
of the future. 

Sutton shook his head. 



There had been only one time 
that this had happened, and this, 
of course, was it. 

Something will stop me, he told 
himself. Something will not let me 
go back. Somehow I will be forced 
to steal the clothes and in the end 
I'll walk to that farmhouse up there 
and ask if they need a hand for the 
harvest. 

For the pattern was set. It had to 
be set. 

Sutton touched the wrench with 
his toe again, pondering. 

Then he turned and went down 
the hill. Glancing over his shoulder 
as he plunged into the woods, he 
saw old John H. coming down the 
hill. 

XXXVI 
FOR three days Sutton toiled 
to free the ship from the tons 
of sand that the treacherous, 
swift-running river currents had 
mounded over it. And he admitted, 
when three days were gone, that it 
was a hopeless task, for the current 
piled up the sand as fast as he 
could clear it. 

After that, he concentrated on 
clearing an opening to the entrance 
lock and when another day went by 
with many cave-ins, he accomplished his purpose. 

Wearily he braced himself 
i against the metal of the ship. 
I A gamble, he told himself. But I 
will have to gamble. 

For there was no possibility of 



110 




 



wrenching the ship free by using 
the engines. The tubes, he knew, 
were packed with sand and any attempt to use the rockets would simply mean that he and the ship and 
a good portion of the landscape 
would evaporate in a flashing puff 
of atomic fury. 

He had lifted a ship from a 
Cygnian planet and driven it across 
eleven years of space by the power 
of mind alone. He had rolled two 
sixes. 

Perhaps, he told himself. Perhaps . . . 

There were tons of sand and he 
was deathly tired, tired despite the 
smooth, efficient functioning of his 
non-human system of metabolism. 

I rolled two sixes, he said. Surely 
that was harder than the task I must 
do now. Although that called for 
deftness and this will call for power 
. . . and suppose, just suppose I 
haven't got the strength. 

For it would take strength to 
lift this buried mass of metal out of 
the mound of sand. Not the 
strength of muscles, but the 
strength of mind. 

Of course, he told himself, if he 
could not lift the ship, he still could 
use the time-mover, shift the ship, 
lying where it was, forward 6,000 
years. Although there were hazards 
he did not like to think about. For 
in shifting the ship through time, 
he would be exposing it to every 
threat and vagary of the river 
through the whole 6,000 years. 

He put his hand up to his throat, 



feeling for the key chain that hung 
around his neck. 

There was no chain! 

Mind dulled by sudden terror, 
he stood frozen for a moment. 

Pockets, he thought, but his 
hands fumbled with a dread certainty that there was no hope. For 
he never put the keys of the ship in 
his pockets . . . always on their 
chain around his neck where they 
would be safe. 

He searched, feverishly at first, 
then with a grim, cold thoroughness. 

His pockets held no keys. 

The chain broke, he thought in 
'frantic desperation. The chain 
broke and it fell inside my clothes. 
He patted himself, carefully, from 
head to foot, and it was not there. 
He took off his shirt, gently, cautiously, feeling for the missing 
keys. He tossed the shirt aside, and 
sitting down, pulled off his trousers, searching in their folds, turning them inside out. 

There were no keys. 

On hands and knees, he searched 
the sands of the river bed, fumbling in the dim light that filtered 
through the rushing water. 

An hour later he gave up. 

The shifting, water-driven sand 
already had closed the trench he 
had dug to the lock, and now there 
was no point of getting to the 
lock, for he could not open it 
when he got there. 

His shirt and trousers had vanished with the current. 



TIME QUARRY 



111 



Wearily, beaten, he turned toward the shore, forcing his way 
through the stubborn water. His 
head broke into open air and the 
first stars of evening were shining 
in the east. 

On shore he sat down with his 
back against a tree. He took one 
breath and then another, willed the 
first heartbeat, then the second and 
a third . . . nursed the human 
metabolism back into action once 
again. 

The river gurgled at him, deep 
laughter on its tongue. In the 
wooded valley a whippoorwill began its sadistic suggestion. Fireflies 
danced through the blackness of 
the bushes. 

A mosquito stung him and he 
slapped at it savagely. 

A place to sleep, he thought. A 
hay-loft in a barn, perhaps. And 
pilfered .food from a 'farmer's garden to fill his empty belly. Then 
clothes. 

At least he knew where he'd get 
the clothes. 

XXXVII 

SUNDAYS were lonely. 
During the rest of the 
week there was work — physical labor — for a man to do, the 
endless, trudging round of work 
that is necessary to extract a living 
from the soil. Land to plow, crops 
to be put in and tended and 
finally harvested, wood to cut, 
fences to be built and mended, 



machines to be repaired — things 
that must be done with bone and 
muscle, with calloused hand and 
aching back and the hot Sun on 
one's neck or the whiplash of 
windy cold ibiting at one's bones. 

For six days a farmer labored 
and the labor was a thing that 
dulled one to the aching emptiness of memory, and, at night, 
when work was done, sleep was 
swift and merciful. There were 
times when the work, not only for 
its sedative effect, but of its very 
self became a thing of interest and 
of satisfaction. The straight line 
of new-set fence posts became a 
minor triumph when one glanced 
back along their length. The harvest field with its dust upon one's 
shoes and its smell of Sun on 
golden straw and the clacking of 
the binder as it went its rounds 
became a full-breasted symbolism 
of plenty and contentment. And 
there were moments when the 
pink blush of apple blossoms shining through the silver rain of 
spring became, a wild and pagan 
paean of the resurrection of the 
Earth from the frosts of winter. 

For six days a man would labor 
and would not have time to think; 
on the seventh day he rested and 
braced himself for the' loneliness 
and the thoughts of desperation 
that idleness would bring. 

Not a loneliness for a people 
or a world or a way of life, for 
this world was kindlier and closer 
to Earth and life and safer — much 



112 




 



safer — than the world one had 
left behind. But a nagging loneliness, an accusing loneliness that 
talked of a job that "waited; a 
piece of work that now might 
wait forever, a task that must be 
done, but now never might be 
done. 

At first there had been hope. 

Surely, Sutton thought, they will 
look for me. Surely they will find 
a way to reach me. 

The thought was a comfort that 
he hugged close against himself, 
a pgace of mind that he could not 
bring himself to analyze too closely. For he realized, even as he 
coddled it, that it was unrealistic, 
that it might not survive too close 
a scrutiny, that it was fashioned of 
faith and of wishful thinking and 
that for all its wealth of comfort 
it might be a fragile bauble. 

THE past cannot be changed, he 
argued with himself, not in 
its entirety. It can be altered — 
subtly. It can be twisted and it 
can be dented and it can be 
whittled down, but by and large 
it stands. And that is - why I'm 
here and will have to stay until 
old John H. writes the letter to 
himself. For the past is in the 
letter — the letter brought me here 
and it will keep me here until it's 
finally written. Up to that point 
the pattern must necessarily hold, 
for up to that point in time the 
past, so far as I and my relation 
with it are concerned, is a known 



and a revealed past. But the moment the letter is written, it becomes an unknown past; it tends 
to the speculative and there is no 
known pattern. After the letter is 
written, so far as I'm concerned, 
anything can happen. 

Although he admitted, even as 
he thought it, that his premise was 
fallacious. Known or not, revealed 
or unrevealed, the past would 
form a pattern. For the past had 
happened. He was living in a time 
that already had been set and 
molded. 

Even in that thought there was 
a hope, however. Even in the unknownness of the past and the 
knowledge that what had happened 
was a thing that stood unchanged, 
there must be hope. For somewhere, somewhen he had written 
a book. The book existed and 
therefore had happened, although, 
of course, it had not happened 
yet. But he had seen two copies 
of the book and that meant that 
in some future age the book was 
a factor in the pattern of the past. 

Sometime, said Sutton, they 
will find me. Sometime -before it 
is too late. 

They will hunt for 'me and find 
me. They will have to find me. 

They? he asked himself, finally 
honest with himself. 

Herkimer, an android. 

Fva Armour, a woman. 

They . . . two people. 

But not those two alone. Surely not those two alone. Back of 



TIME QUARRY

them, like a shadowy army, all the 
other androids and all the robots 
that Man had ever fashioned. And 
here and there a human who saw 
the Tightness of the proposition 
that Man could not, by mere selfassertion, be a special being; understanding that it was to his 
greater glory to take his place 
among the other things of life, as 
a simple thing of life, as a form of 
life that could lead and teach and 
be a friend, rather than a powerhungry creature that conquered 
and ruled and stood as one apart. 

They would look for him, of 
course, but where? 

With all of time and all of 
space to search in, how would 
they know when and where to 
look? 

ri iHE robot at the information 
J. center, he remembered, could 
tell them that he had inquired 
about an ancient , town called 
Bridgeport, Wisconsin. And that 
would tell them where. But no one 
could tell them when. 

For no one knew about the 
letter . . . absolutely no one. He 
remembered how the dried and 
flaky mucilage had showered down 
across his hands in a white and 
aged powder when his thumb 
nail had cracked loose the flap of 
the envelope. No one, certainly, 
had seen the contents of that 
letter since the day it had been 
written until he, himself, had 
opened it. 



He realized now that he should 
have gotten word to someone . . . 
word of where and when he was 
going and what he meant to do. 
But he had been so confident and 
it had seemed such a simple thing, 
such a splendid plan. 

A splendid plan in the very 
directness of its action . . . to intercept the Revisionist, to knock 
him out and take his ship and go 
forward into time to take his place. 
It could have been arranged, of 
that he was certain. There would 
have been an android somewhere 
to help fashion his disguise. There 
would have been papers in the 
ship and androids from the future 
to brief him on the things that he 
would have had to know. 

A splendid plan . . . except it 
hadn't worked. 

I could have told the information robot, Sutton told himself. 
He certainly was one of us. He 
would have passed the word along. 

He sat with his back against the 
tree and stared out across the river 
valley, hazy with the blue of the 
Indian summer. In the field below 
him the corn stood in brown and 
golden shocks, like a village of 
wigwams that clustered tight and 
warm against the sure knowledge 
of the winter's coming. To the 
west the bluffs of the Mississippi 
were a purple cloud that crouched 
close against the land. To the north 
the golden land swept up in low 
hill rising on low hill until it 
reached a misty point where, 



114 




 



somewhere, land stopped and sky 
began, although one could not find 
the definite dividing point, no 
clear-cut pencil mark that held the 
two apart. 

A field mouse came out of a 
corn shock and looked at Sutton 
for a moment with its beady eyes, 
then squeaked in sudden fright 
and whisked into the shock again, 
its tail looped above its back in 
frantic alarm. 

Simple folk, thought Sutton. 
The little, simple, furry folk. They 
would be with me, too, if they 
could only know. The bluejay and 
the field mouse, the owl and hawk 
and squirrel. A brotherhood, he 
thought . . . the brotherhood of 
life. 

HE HEARD the mouse rustling 
in the shock and he tried to 
imagine what life as a mouse might 
mean. Fear first of all, of course, 
the ever-present, quivering, overriding fear of other life, of owl 
and hawk, of mink and fox and 
skunk. And the fear of Man, he 
added. All things fear Man. Man 
has caused all things to fear him. 

Then there would be hunger, or 
at least the dread and threat of 
hunger. And the urge to reproduce. There would be the urgency 
and the happiness of life, the 
thrill of swiftly moving feet and 
the 'sleek contentment of the wellfilled belly and the sweetness of 
sleep . . . and what else? What 
else might fill a mouse's life? 



He crouched in a place of safety 
and listened and knew that all -was 
well. All was safe and there were 
food and shelter against the coming cold. For he knew about the 
cold, not so much from the experience of other winters as from 
an instinct handed down* through 
many generations of shivering in 
the cold and dying of winter 
famine. 

To his ears came the soft 
rustlings in the corn shock as 
others of his kind moved softly 
on their business. He smelled the 
sweetness of the Sun-cured grass 
that had been brought in to fashion nests for warm and easy sleeping. And he smelled, as well, the 
grains of corn and the succulent 
weed seeds that would keep their 
bellies full. 

All is well, he thought. All is 
as it should be. But one must keep 
watch, one must never lower one's 
guard, for security is a thing that 
can be swept away in a single instant. And we are so soft ... we 
are so soft and frail, and we make 
good eating. A paw-step in the 
dark can spell swift and sure disaster. A whir of wings is the song 
of death. 

He closed his eyes and tucked 
his feet beneath him and wrapped 
his tail around him. . . . 

Sutton sat with his back against 
the tree and suddenly, without 
knowing how or when he had become so, he was rigid with the 
knowledge of what had happened. 



TIME QUARRY 



MS 



He had closed his eyes and 
tucked his feet beneath him and 
wrapped his tail about him and he 
had known the simple fears and 
the artless, ambitionless contentment of another life ... of a life 
that hid in a corn shock from the 
paw-steps and the wings, that slept 
in Sun-scented grass and felt a 
vague but vital happiness in the 
sure and fundamental knowledge 
of food and warmth and shelter. 

HE HAD not felt it merely, or 
known it alone ... he had 
been the little creature, he had 
been the mouse that the corn shock 
sheltered; and at the one and the 
same time he had been Asher Sutton, sitting with his back against 
a straight-trunked shellbark hickory tree, gazing out across the 
autumn-painted valley. 

There were two of us, said 
Sutton. I, myself, and I, the mouse. 
There were two of us at once, each 
with his separate identity. The 
mouse, the real mouse, did not 
know it, for if he had known or 
guessed, I would have known as 
well, for I was as much the mouse 
as I was myself. 

He sat quiet and still, not a 
muscle moving, wonder gnawing 
at him. Wonder and a fear, a fear 
of a dormant alienness that lay 
within his brain. 

He had brought a ship from 
Cygni, he had returned from death, 
he had rolled a six. 
Now this! 



A man is born and he has a 
body and a mind that have many 
functions, some of them complex, 
and it takes him years to learn 
those functions, more years to 
master them. Months before one 
takes a toddling step, months more 
before one shapes a word, years 
before thought and logic become 
polished tools . . . and sometimes, 
said Sutton, sometimes they never 
do. 

Even then there is a certain 
guidance, the guidance of experienced mentors . . . parents at 
first and teachers after that and 
the doctors and the churches and 
all the men of science and the 
people that one meets. All the people, all the contacts, all the forces 
that operate to shape one into a 
social being capable of using the 
talents that he holds for the good 
of himself and the society which 
guides him and holds him to its 
path. 

Heritage, too, thought Sutton 
. . . the inbred knowledge and the 
will to do and think certain things 
in a certain way. The tradition of 
what other men have done and 
the precepts that have been fashioned from the wisdom of the 
ages. 

The normal human has one 
body and one mind, and Lord 
knows, Sutton thought, that is 
enough for any man to get along 
with. But I, to all intent, have 
what amounts to a second body 
and perhaps even a second mind, 



116 




 



but for that second body I have 
no mentors and I have no heritage. 
I do not know how to use it yet; 
I'm just taking my first toddling 
step. I am finding out, slowly, one 
by one, the things that I may do. 
Later on, if I live long enough, 
I may even learn to do them well. 

But there are mistakes that one 
will make. A child will stumble 
when it walks at first, and its 
words, to begin with, are only the 
approximation of words, and it 
does not know enough not to burn 
its finger with matches it has 
lighted. 

"Johnny," he said. "Johnny, 
talk to me." 
"Yes, Ash?" 

"Is there more, Johnny?" 

"Wait and see," said Johnny. 
"I cannot tell you. You must wait 
and see."

THE android investigator 
said: "We checked Bridgeport back to the year 
2,000 and we are convinced nothing happened there. It was a small 
village and it lay off the main 
trunk of world happenings." 

"It wouldn't have to be a big 
thing," Eva Armour told him. "It 
could have been a little thing. Just 
some slight clue. A word out of 
the context of the future, perhaps. 
A word that Sutton might have 
dropped in some unguarded moment and someone else picked up 



and used. Within a few years a 
word like that would become a 
part of the dialect of that community." 

"We checked for the little 
things, miss," the investigator 
said. "We checked for any change, 
any hint that might point to Sutton having been in that community. We used approved methods 
and we covered the field. But we 
found nothing, absolutely nothing. The place is barren of any 
leads at all." 

"He must have gone there," 
said Eva. "The robot at the information center talked to him. He 
asked about Bridgeport. It indicates that he had some interest in 
the place." 

"But it didn't necessarily indicate that he was going there," 
Herkimer pointed out. 

"He went some place," said 
Eva. "Where did he go?" 

"We threw in as large a force 
of investigators as was possible 
without arousing suspicion, both 
locally and in the future," the investigator told them. "Our men 
practically fell over one another. 
We sent them out as book salesmen and scissor grinders and unemployed laborers looking for 
work. We canvassed every home 
for forty miles around, first at 
twenty-year intervals, then, when 
w&ilfound nothing, at ten, and 
finally at five. If there had been 
any word or any rumor, we would 
have run across it."

117 



"Back to the year 2,000, you 
say?" asked Herkimer. "Why not 
to 1999 or 1950 or even 1800?" 

"We had to set an arbitrary 
date somewhere," the investigator 
told him. 

"The Sutton family lived in 
that locality," said Eva. "I suppose 
you investigated them just a bit 
more closely."' 

"We had men working on the 
Sutton farm off and on," said the 
investigator. "As often as the 
family was in need of any help 
on the farm, one of our men 
showed up to get himself the job. 
When the family needed no help, 
we had men on other farms nearby. One of our men bought a tract 
of timber in that locality and spent 
ten years at woodcutting ... he 
could have stretched it out much 
longer, but we were afraid someone would get suspicious. 

"We did this from the year 
2,000 up to 3150, when the last 
of the family moved from the 
area." 

"TWA looked at Herkimer. "The 
-I— i family has been checked all 
the way?" she asked. 

Herkimer nodded. "Right to the 
day that Asher left for Cygni. 
There's nothing that would help 
us." 

Eva said, "It seems so hopeless. 
He is somewhere. Something happened to him. The future, perhaps." 

"That's what I was thinking," 



Herkimer told her. "The Revisionists may have intercepted him. 
They may be holding him." 

"They couldn't hold him . . . 
not Asher Sutton," Eva said. 
"They couldn't hold him if he 
knew all his powers." 

"But he doesn't know them," 
Herkimer reminded her. "And we 
couldn't tell him about them or 
draw them to his attention. He 
had to find them for himself. He 
had to be put under pressure and 
suddenly discover them by natural 
reaction. He couldn't be taught 
them; he had to evolve into 
them." 

"We did so well," said Eva. 
"We seemed to be doing so well. 
We forced Morgan into ill-considered action by conditioning 
Benton into challenging Sutton, 
the one quick way to get rid of 
Asher when Adams failed to fall 
in with the plan to kill him. And 
that Benton incident put Asher on 
his guard without our having to 
tell him that he should be careful. 
And now," she said. "And 
now. . . ." 

"The book was written," Herkimer told her. 

"But it doesn't have to be," said 
Eva. "You and I may be no more 
than puppets in some probability 
world that will pinch out tomorrow." 

"We'll cover all key points in 
the future," Hefkimer promised 
her. "We'll redouble our espionage of the Revisionists, check back 



118 




 



on every task force of the past. 
Maybe we'll learn something." 

"It's the random factors," Eva 
said. "You can't be sure, ever. All 
of time and space for them to 
happen in. How can we know 
where to look or turn? Do we 
have to fight our way through 
every possible happening to get 
the thing we want?" 

"You forget one factor," Herkimer said calmly. 

"One factor?" 

"Yes, Sutton himself. Sutton is 
somewhere and I have great faith 
in him. In him and his destiny. 
For, you see, he listens closely to 
his destiny and that will pay off 
in the end." 

Eva walked to the window. 

Ash, she thought. Ash, my love, 
you simply have to be all right. 
You must know what you're doing. You must come back to us 
and you must write the book 
and. . . . 

Not for me alone, she thought. 
Not for me alone, for I, least of 
all of them, have a claim on you. 
But the galaxy has a claim on you, 
and maybe someday the universe. 
The little striving lives are waiting for your words and the hope 
and dignity they spell. And most 
of all the dignity. Dignity ahead 
of hope. The dignity of equality 
. . . the dignity of the knowledge 
that all life is on an equal basis 
. . . that life is all that matters 
. . . that life is the badge of a 
greater brotherhood than anything 



the mind of Man has ever spelled 
out in all its theorizing. 

And I, she thought, have no 
right to think the way I do, to feel 
the way I do. 

But I can't help it, Ash. I can't 
help but love you. 

Someday, she thought, and knew 
it for a hopeless wish. 

She stood straight and lonely 
and the tears moved slowly down 
her cheeks, and she did not raise 
her hand to brush them off. 

Dreams, she thought. Broken 
dreams are bad enough. But the

C ( 1ST 7~OU are a strange man, 
Y William Jones," John 
I H. Sutton told him. 
"And a good one, too. I've never 
had a better hired hand in all the 
years I've farmed. None of the 
others would stay more than a 
year or two, always running off, 
always going somewhere." 

"I have no place to go," said 
Asher Sutton. "There's no place I 
want to go. This is as good as 
any." 

And it was better, he told himself,', than he had thought it 
would be, for here were peace and 
security and living close to nature 
that no man of his own age ever 
had experienced.

The two men leaned on the pasture bars and watched the twinkling of the house and auto lights 
from across the river. In the darkness on the slope below them, the 
cattle, turned out after milking, 
moved about with quiet, soft 
sounds, cropping a last few mouthfuls of grass before settling down 
to sleep. A breeze with a touch of 
coolness in it drifted up the slope 
and it was fine and soothing after 
a day of heat. 

"We always get a cool night 
breeze," said old John H. "No 
matter how hot the day may be, 
we have easy sleeping." 

He sighed. "I wonder sometimes," he said, "how well contented a man should let himself 
become. I wonder if it may not be 
a sign of — well, almost sinfulness. 
For Man is not by nature a contented animal. He is restless and 
unhappy and it's that same unhappiness that has driven him, like 
a lash across his back, to his great 
accomplishments." 

"Contentedness," said Asher 
Sutton, "is an indication of complete adjustment to one's particular environment. It is a thing that 
is not often found . . . that is too 
seldom found. Someday Man, and 
other creatures as well, will know 
how to achieve it and there will be 
peace and happiness in all the galaxy." 

John H. chuckled. "You take 
in a lot of territory, William." 
"I was taking the long-range 



view," said Sutton. "Someday Man 
will be going to the stars." 

John H. nodded. "Yes, I suppose he will. But he will go too 
soon. Before Man goes to the stars, 
he should learn how to live on 
Earth." 

He yawned and said: "I think 
I will turn in. Getting old, you 
know, and I need my rest." 

"I'm going to walk around a 
bit," said Sutton. 

''You do a lot of walking, William." 

"After dark," said Sutton, "the 
land is different than it is in daylight. It smells different. Sweet 
and fresh and clean, as if it were 
just washed. You hear things in 
the quietness you do not hear in 
daylight. You walk and you are 
alone with the land and the land 
belongs to you." 

JOHN H. wagged his head. "It's 
not the land that's different, 
William. It is you. Sometimes I 
think you see and hear things that 
the rest of us do not know. Almost, William. . . ." he hesitated, 
then added abruptly, "almost as if 
you did not quite belong." 
"Sometimes I think I don't." 
"Remember this," John H. told 
him. "You are one of us . . . one 
of the family, seems like. Let me 
see, how many years now?" 
"Ten," said Sutton. 
"That's right. I can usually recall the day you came, but sometimes I forget. Sometimes it seems 



120 




 



that you were always here. Sometimes I catch myself thinking 
you're a Sutton." 

He hacked and cleared his 
throat, spitting in the dust. "I 
borrowed your typewriter the 
other day, William. I had a letter 
I had to write. It was an important letter and I wanted it done 
properly." 

"It's all right," said Sutton. "I'm 
glad it was some use to you." 

"Getting any writing done these 
days, William?" 

"No," said Sutton, "I gave up. 
I couldn't do it. I lost my notes, 
you see. I had it all figured out. 
and I had it down on paper, and 
I thought maybe I could remember it, but I found I couldn't. It's 
no use trying." 

John H.'s voice was a soft, low 
sound in the darkness. "You in 
any kind of trouble, William?" 

"No," said Sutton. "Not exactly 
trouble." 

"Anything I can do to help?" 

"Not a thing," said Sutton. 

"Let roe know if there is," insisted the old man. "We'd do anything for you." 

"Someday I may go away," said 
Sutton. "Maybe suddenly. If I do, 
I wish you would forget me, forget I was ever here." 

"That's What you wish, lad?" 

"Yes, it is," said Sutton. 

"We can't forget you, William. 
We never could do that. But we 
won't talk about you. If someone 
comes and asks about you, we'll 



act as if you never had been here." 

He paused. "Is that the way you 
want it, William?" 

"Yes," said Sutton. "If you 
don't mind, that's the way I want 
it." 

They stood silent for a moment, 
facing one another in the dark. 
Then the old man turned around 
and clumped toward the lighted 
windows of the house and Sutton, 
turning, too, leaned his arms on 
the pasture bars and stared across 
the river where the faery lights 
were blinking in a land of nevernever. 

TEN years, thought Sutton, and 
the letter's written. Ten years 
and the conditions of the past are 
met. Now the past can get along 
without me, for I was only staying so that John H. could write 
the letter ... so that he could 
write it and I could find it in an 
old trunk 6,000 years from now 
and read it on a nameless asteroid 
I won by killing a man in a place 
of synthetic dreams that will be 
called the Zag House. 

The Zag House will be over 
there across the river, he thought, 
far up the plain above the ancient 
town of Prairie du Chien; and the 
University of North America, with 
its towers of beauty, will be set 
on the hills there to the north, 
and Adams' house will be near the 
confluence of the Wisconsin and 
Mississippi Rivers. Great ships will 
climb into the sky from the Iowa 



TIME QUARRY 



121 



prairies and head out for the stars 
that even now are twinkling overhead . . . and other stars that no 
man's eye can see unaided. 

Far across the river, he thought, 
that's where the Zag House will 
be. And that is where someday, 
6,000 years from now, I will meet 
a little girl in a checkered apron. 
Like in a story, he thought. Boy 
meets girl and the boy is towheaded with a cowlick and he's 
barefooted and the .girl twists her 
apron in her little hands and tells 
him what her name is. . . . 

He . straightened and gripped the 
top bar of the pasture gate. 

"Eva," he said hopelessly, 
"where are you?" 

Her hair was copper and her 
eyes . . what color were her eyes? 
I have studied you for twenty 
years, she had said, and he had 
wanted to kiss her for it, not believing the words she spoke, but 
ready to believe the unspoken 
word of her proud face and lovely 
body. 

Somewhere she still 'existed, 
somewhere in time and space. 
Somewhere she might be thinking 
of him as even now he thought of 
her. If he tried hard enough, he 
might contact her. Might drive his 
hunger for her through the folds 
of space and time and let her 
know that he still remembered, 
still wanted her, that somehow, 
sometime he would come back to 
her. 

But even as he thought of it, he 



knew that it was unreal, that he 
floundered in the grasp of forgotten time as a man may flounder in 
a running sea. It was not he who 
would reach out for her, for he 
could not, but she or Herkimer or 
someone else might reach out to 
him ... if anyone ever did. 

Ten years, he thought, and they 
seem to have forgotten me. Is it 
because they cannot find me, or, 
having found me, cannot reach 
me? Or is it for a purpose, and if 
that is it, what can the purpose be? 

There had been times when he 
had felt that he was being 
watched, that nasty touch of cold 
between the shoulder blades. And 
there had been the time when 
someone had run from him when 
he had been in the woods, late of 
a summer evening, hunting for the 
fence-jumping, cross-eyed heifer 
that was forever getting lost. 

He turned from the pasture bars 
and through the barnyard, making 
his way in the darkness as a man 
will walk in a well- remembered 
room. From the barn came the 
scent of freshly mown hay, and in 
the row of chicken coops one of 
the young birds was cheeping 
sleepily. 

EVEN as he walked, his mind 
flicked out and touched the 
disturbed chicken's mind. 

Fluttering dread of an unknown 
thing . . . there had been a sound 
coming on the edge of sleep. And 
a sound was danger ... a signal of 



122 




 



an unknown danger. Sound and 
nowhere to go. Darkness and 
sound. Apprehension. 

Sutton pulled back his mind 
and walked on. Not much stability 
in a chicken, he thought. A cow 
was contented and its thought and 
purpose as slow-moving as its feeding. A dog was alive and friendly, 
and a cat, no matter how well 
tamed it might be, still walked the 
jungle's edge. 

I know them all, he thought. I 
have been each one of them. And 
there are some that are not quite 
pleasant. A rat, for example, or a 
weasel or a bass lying in wait beneath the lily pads. But the skunk 
. . . the skunk was a pleasant fellow. One could enjoy living as-a« 
skunk. 

Curiosity or practice? Perhaps 
curiosity, he admitted, the human, 
penchant for prying into things 
that were hung with signs: No 
Trespassing. Keep Out. Private. 
Do Not Disturb. But practice as 
well, learning one of the tools of 
the second body. Learning how to 
move into another mind and share 
its every shade of intellectual and 
emotional reactions. 

But there was a line ... a line 
he had never crossed, either 
through innate decency or a fear 
of being found out. He could not 
decide quite which. 

The road was a dusty strip of 
white that ran along the ridge, 
twisting between the deep bowls 
of darkness where the land fell 



away into deep hollows. Sutton 
walked slowly, footfalls muffled by 
the dust. The land was black and 
the road was white and the stars 
were large and soft in the summer 
night. So different, Sutton thought, 
from the winter stars. In the winter the stars retreated high into the 
sky and glowed with a hard and 
steely light. 

Peace and quiet, he told himself. 
In this corner of the ancient Earth 
there is peace and quiet, unbroken 
by the turbulence of twentieth century living. 

From a land like this came the 
steady men, the men who in a few 
more generations would ride the 
ships out to the stars. Here, in the 
quiet corners of the world, were 
built the stamina and courage, the 
depth of character and the deep 
convictions that would take the engines that more brilliant, less stable 
men had dreamed, and drive them 
to the farthest rims of the galaxy, 
there to hold key. worlds for the 
glory and the profit of the race. 

The profit, Sutton said. The 
glory gets dimmed by profit somehow. 

Ten years, he thought, and the 
involuntary compact with time has 
been consummated . . . each condition filled. I am free to go. 

But there was no place to go and 
no way to get there. 

I would like to stay, said Sutton. 
It is pleasant here. 

"Johnny," he said. "Johnny, 
what are we going to do?" 



TIME QUARRY 



123 



HE FELT the stit in his mind, 
the old canine stir, the wagging tail, the comfort of blankets 
tucked about a child in his bed. 

"It's all right, Ash," said 
Johnny. "Everything's all right. 
You needed these ten years." 

"You've stayed with me, 
Johnny." 

"I am you," said Johnny. "I 
came when you were born, I'll stay 
until you die." 
"And then?" 

"You'll not need me, Ash. I'll 
go to something or someone else. 
None walks ' alone." 
• None walks alone, said Sutton, 
and he said it like a prayer. 

And he was not alone. 

Someone walked beside him, and 
where he'd come from, and how 
long he'd been there, Sutton did 
not know. 

"This, is a splendid walk," said 
the man, whose face was hidden in 
darkness. "Do you take it often?" 

"Almost every night," said Sutton's tongue, and his brain warned: 
Steady! Steady! 

"It's so quiet," said the man. 
"So quiet and alone. It is good for 
thinking. A man could do a lot of 
thinking, walking nights out here." 

Sutton did not answer. 

They plodded along, side by 
side, and even while he fought to 
keep relaxed, Sutton felt his body 
tensing. 

"You've been doing a lot of 
thinking, Sutton," said the man. 
"Ten whole years of thinking."' 



"You should know," said Sutton. "You've been watching me." 

"We've watched," admitted the 
man. "And our machines have 
watched. We got you down on 
tape and we know a lot about you. 
A whole lot more than we did ten 
years ago." 

"Ten years ago," said Sutton, 
"you sent two men to buy me off." 

"I know," replied the man. "We 
have often wondered what became 
of them." 

"That's an easy one," Sutton 
said. "I killed them." 

"They had a proposition." 

"If you can call it that. They 
offered me a planet." 

"I knew at the time it wouldn't 
work," the man declared. "I told 
Trevor that it wouldn't work." 

"I suppose you have another 
proposition?" Sutton asked. "A 
slightly higher price?" 

"Not exactly," said the man. 
"We thought this time we'd cut 
out the bargaining and just let you 
name your price." 

"I'll think about it," Sutton told 
him. "I'm not too sure I can think 
up a price." 

"As you wish, Sutton," said the 
man. "We'll be waiting . . . and 
watching. Just give us the sign 
when you've made up your mind." 

"A sign?" 

"Sure. Just write us a note. 
We'll be looking over your shoulder. Or just say . . . 'Well, I've 
made up my mind.' We'll be listening and we'll hear." 



124 




 



"Simple," Sutton replied. 
"Nothing to it." 

"We make it easy for you," said 
the man. "Good evening, Mr. Sutton." 

Sutton did not see him do it, but 
sensed that he had touched his hat 
. . . if he wore a hat. Then he was 
gone, turning off the road and 
going down across the pasture, 
walking in the dark, heading for 
the woods that sloped to the river 
bluffs. 

SUTTON stood in the dusty 
road and listened to him go — 
the soft swish of dew-laden grass 
brushing on his shoes, the muted 
pad of his feet in the pasture. 

Contact at last! After ten years, 
contact with the people from another time. But the wrong people. 
Not his people. 

The Revisionists had been watching him, even as he had sensed 
them watching. Watching and 
waiting, waiting for ten years. But, 
of course, not ten years of their 
time, just ten years of his. Machines and watchers would have 
been sprinkled through those ten 
years, so that the job could have 
been done in a year or a month, or 
even in a week, if they had wanted 
to throw enough men and materials into the effort. 

But why wait ten years? To 
soften him up, to make him ready 
to jump at anything they offered? 

To soften him up? He grinned 
wryly in the dark ( 



Then suddenly the picture came 
to him and he stood there stupidly, 
wondering why he hadn't thought 
of it much sooner. 

They hadn't waited to soften 
him up . . . they had waited for 
old John H. to write the letter. 
For they knew about the letter. 
They had studied old John H. and 
they knew he'd write a letter. They 
had him down on tape and they 
knew him inside out and they had 
figured to an eyelash the way his 
mind would work. 

The letter was the key to the 
whole thing. The letter was the 
lure that had been used to suck 
Asher Sutton back into this time. 
They had lured him, then sealed 
him off and kept him, kept him as 
surely as if they'd had him in a 
cage. They had studied him and 
they knew him and they had him 
figured out. They knew what he 
would do as surely as they had 
known what old John H. would 
do. 

His mind flicked out and probed 
cautiously at the brain of the man 
striding down the hill. 

Chickens and cats and dogs and 
meadow mice — and not one of 
them suspected, not one of them 
had known that another mind than 
theirs had occupied their brain. 

But the brain of a man might be 
a different matter. Highly trained 
and sensitive, it might detect: outside interference, might sensey if it 
did not actually know, the invasion 
of itself.

The girl won't wail. I've been 
aivay too long. Her affections are 
less than skin deep and she has no 
morals, absolutely none, and I'm 
the one to know. I've been on this 
damn patrol too long. She will be 
tired of wailing . . . she was tired 
of waiting when I was gone three 
hours. To hell with her . . . I can 
get another one. But not like her 
. . . not exactly like her. There 
isn't another one anywhere quite 
like her. 

Whoever said this Sutton guy 
would be an easy one to crack was 
crazy as a loon. God, after ten 
years in a dump like this, I'd fall 
on someone's neck and kiss 'em if 
they came back from my own time. 
Anyone at all . . . friend or foe, it 
would make no difference. Bill 
what d~oes Sutton do? Not a damn 
word. N.ot a single syllable of surprise in any word he spoke. W hen 
I first spoke to him, he didn't even 
break his stride, kept right on 
walking as if he knew I'd been 
there all the time. Cripes, I could 
use a drink. Nerve-wracking work. 

Wish I could forget that girl. 
Wish she would be waiting for 
me, but I know she won't. Wish . . . 

SUTTON snapped back his 
mind, stood quietly in the 
road. 

And inside himself he felt the 
shiver of triumph, the swift backwash of relief and triumph. They 
didn't know. In all their ten years 
of watching, they had seen no more 



than the superficial things.. They 
had him down on tape, but they 
didn't know all that went on within his mind. 

A human mind, perhaps. But 
not his mind. A human mind they 
might be able to strip as bare as a 
sickled field, might dissect it and 
analyze it and read the story in it. 
But his mind told them only what 
it wished to tell them, only enough 
so that there would.be no suspicion 
that he was holding back. Ten 
years ago Adams' gang had tried 
to tap his mind and had not even 
dented it. 

The Revisionists had watched 
ten years and they knew each motion that he made, many of the 
things that he had thought. 

But they did not know that he 
could go to live within the mind 
of a mouse or a catfish or a man. 

For if they had known, they 
would have set up certain safeguards, would have been on the 
alert against him. 

And they weren't. No more 
alert than the mouse had been. 

He glanced back the road to 
where the Sutton farmhouse stood 
upon the hill. For a moment he 
thought that he could see it, a 
darker mass against the darkness of 
the sky, but that, he knew, was no 
more than pure imagination. He 
knew it was there and he had 
formed a mental image. 

One by one, he checked the 
items in his room. The books, the 
few scribbled papers, the razor. 



126 




 



There was nothing there, he 
knew, that he could not leave behind. Not a thing that would 
arouse suspicion. Nothing that 
could be fastened on in some later 
day and turned into a weapon to 
be used against him. 

He had been prepared against 
this day, knowing that some day it 
would come — that some day Herkimer or the Revisionists or. an 
agent from the government would 
step from behind a tree and walk 
along beside him. 

Knowing? Well, not exactly. 
Hoping. And ready for the hope. 

Long years ago his futile attempt 
to write the book of destiny without his notes had gone up in 
smoke. All that remained was a 
heap of paper ash, mixed these 
many years with the soil. Bleached 
away by the rains, gone as chemical 
elements into a head of wheat or 
an ear of corn. 

He was ready. Packed and 
ready. His mind had been packed 
and ready, he knew now, for these 
many years. 

Softly he stepped off the road 
and went down across the pasture, 
following the man who walked toward the river bluffs. His mind 
flicked out and tracked him through 
the darkness, using his thoughts to 
track him as a hdund would use 
his nose to track a fox. 

HE OVERHAULED him scant 
minutes after he had entered 
the fringe of trees and after that 



kept a few paces behind him, walking carefully to guard against the 
suddenly snapping twig, the swish 
of swaying bushes that could have 
warned his quarry. 

The ship lay within a deep ravine and at a hail it lighted up and 
a port swung open. Another man 
stood in the port and stared into 
the night. 

"That you, Gus?". he called. 

The other swore at him. "Who 
else do you think would be floundering around in these woods at 
the dead of night?" 

"I got to worrying," said the 
man in the port. "You were gone 
longer than I thought you would 
be. Just getting ready to set out 
and hunt for you." 

"You're always worrying," Gus 
growled at him. "Between you and 
this outlandish ancient world, I'm 
fed up. Trevor can find someone 
else to do this kind of work from 
here on out." 

He scrambled up the steps into 
the ship. "Get going," he told the 
other man tersely. "We're getting 
out of here." 

He turned to shut the port, but 
Sutton already had it closed. 

Gus took two steps backward, 
brought up against an anchored 
chair and stood there, grinning. 

"Look at what we got," he said. 
"Hey,. Pinky, look at what followed me back home." 

Sutton smiled at them grimly. 
"If you gentlemen have no objection, I'll hitch a ride with you." 



TIME QUARRY 



127 



"And if we 'have objections?" 
Pinky asked. 

"I'm riding this ship," Sutton 
told him. "With you or without 
you. Take your choice." 

"This is Sutton," Gus told 
Pinky. "The Mr. Sutton. Trevor 
will be glad to see you, Sutton." 

Trevor . . . Trevor. That was 
three times he had heard the name, 
and somewhere else he had heard 
it once before. He stood with his 
back against the closed port and 
his mind returned to another ship 
and another two men. 

"Trevor," Case had said, or had 
it been Pringle who had said it? 
"Trevor? Why, Trevor is the head 
of the corporation." 

"I've been looking forward, all 
these years," Sutton told them, "to 
meeting Mr. Trevor. He and I will 
have a lot to talk about." 

"Get her going, Pinky," Gus 
said. "And send ahead a message. 
Trevor will want to break out the 
guard of honor for us. We're 
bringing Asher Sutton back." 

XL 

TREVOR picked up a paper 
clip and flipped it at an ink 
well on the desk. The clip 
landed in the ink. 

"Getting pretty good," said 
Trevor: "Hit it seven times out of 
every ten. Used to be I missed it 
seven times out of every ten." 

He looked at Sutton, studying 
him. 



"You look like an ordinary 
man," he said. "I should be able to 
talk with you and make you understand." 

"I haven't any horns," said Sutton, "if that is what you mean." 

"Nor," said Trevor, "any halo, 
either, so far as I'm concerned." 

He flipped another paper clip 
and it missed the ink well. 

"Seven out of ten," said Trevor. 

He flipped another one. 

"Sutton," said Trevor, "you 
know a great deal about destiny. 
Have you ever thought of it in 
terms of manifest destiny?" 

Sutton shrugged. "You're using 
an antiquated term. Pure and simple propaganda of the nineteenth 
century. There was a certain nation 
that wore that one threadbare." 

"Propaganda?" Trevor repeated. 
"Let's call it psychology. You say 
a thing so often and so well that 
after a time everyone believes it. 
Even, finally, yourself." 

"This manifest destiny," said 
Sutton. "For the human race, I 
presume?" 

"Naturally," said Trevor. "After 
all, we're the animals that would 
know how to use it to the best 
advantage." 

"You pass up a point," declared 
Sutton. "The humans don't need 
it. They already think they are 
great and right and holy. Certainly 
you don't need to propagandize 
them." 

"In the short view, you are 
right," agreed Trevor. "But in the 



128 




 



short view only." He stabbed a 
sudden finger at Sutton. "Once we 
have the galaxy in hand, what do 
we do then ?" 

"Why," said Sutton and stopped. 
"Why, I suppose . . ." 

"That's exactly it," said Trevor. 
"You don't know where you're 
going. Nor does the human race." 

"And manifest destiny?" asked 
Sutton. "If we had manifest destiny, it would be different?" 

Trevor's words were scarcely 
more than a whisper. "There are 
other galaxies, Sutton. Greater 
even than this one. Many other 
galaxies." 

Good Lord! thought Sutton. 

He started to speak and then 
closed his mouth and sat stiffly in 
his chair. 

Trevor's whisper speared at him 
from across the desk. 

"Staggers you, doesn't it?" he 
demanded. 

Sutton tried to speak aloud, but 
his voice came out a whisper, too. 

"You're mad, Trevor. Absolutely mad." 

"The long-range view," said 
Trevor. "That is what we need. 
The absolutely unshakable belief 
in human destiny, the positive and 
all-inclusive conviction that Man 
is meant not only to take over this 
galaxy alone, but all the galaxies, 
the entire universe." 

«yOU should live long 
-L enough," said Sutton, sudden mockery rising to his tongue. 



"I won't see it, of course," admitted Trevor. "And neither will 
you. Nor will our children's children or their children for many 
generations." 

"It will take a million years," 
Sutton told him. 

"More than a million years," 
Trevor answered calmly. "You 
have no idea, no conception of the 
scope of the universe. In a million 
years we'll just be getting a good 
start. . . ." 

"Then, why, for the love of 
heaven, do you and I sit here and 
quibble about it?" 

"Logic," said Trevor. 

"There is no real logic," Sutton 
declared, "in planning a million 
years ahead. A man can plan his 
own lifetime, if he wishes, and 
there is -some logic in that. Or the 
life of his children and there still 
•would be some logic in it . . . and 
maybe in the life of his grandchildren. But beyond that there can 
be no logic." 

"Sutton," asked Trevor, "did 
you ever hear of a corporation?" 

"Why, yes, of course, but..." 

"A corporation could plan for a 
million years," said Trevor. "It 
could plan very logically." 

"A corporation is not a man," 
said Sutton. "It is not an entity.'' 

"But it is," insisted Trevor. "An 
en f ity composed of men and created 
by men to carry out their wishes. It 
is a living, operative concept that 
is handed down from one generation to another to carry out a plan

12? 



too vast to be accomplished in the 
lifetime of one man alone." 

"Your corporation publishes 
books, too, doesn't it?" asked Sutton. 

Trevor stared at him. "Who told 
you that?" he snapped. 

"A couple of men by the name 
of Case and Pringle. They tried to 
buy my book for your, corporation." 

"Case and Pringle are out on a 
mission," Trevor said. "I had expected them back . . ." 

"They won't be coming back." 

"You killed them," Trevor said, 
flatly. 

"They tried to kill me first. I'm 
awfully hard to kill." 

"That would have been against 
my orders, Sutton. I do not want 
you killed." 

"They were on their own," said 
Sutton. "They were going to sell 
my carcass to Morgan." 

There was no way of telling, 
Sutton thought, how you hit this 
man. There was no difference of 
expression in his eyes, no faintest 
flicker of change across his face. 

"I appreciate your killing 
them," said Trevor. "It saves me 
the bother." 

He flicked a clip at the ink well 
and it was a hit. 

"It's logical," he continued, as 
though Sutton had not spoken, 
"that a corporation should plan a 
million years ahead. It provides a 
framework within which a certain 
project may be carried forward 



without interruption, although the 
personnel in charge should change 
from time to time." 

"Wait a minute," Sutton told 
him. "Is there a corporation or are 
you just posing fables?" 

"r 1 1HERE is a corporation," 
J- Trevor told him, "and I am 
the man who heads it. Varied interests pooling their resources . . . 
and there will be more and more 
of them as time goes on. As soon 
as we can show something tangible." 

"By tangible, you mean destiny 
for the human race, for the human 
race alone?" 

Trevor nodded. "Then we'll 
have something to talk about. A 
commodity to sell. Something to 
back up our sales talk." 

Sutton shook his head. "I can't 
see what you expect to gain." 

"Three things," Trevor told 
him. "Wealth and power and 
knowledge. The wealth and power 
and knowledge of the universe. 
For Man alone, you understand. 
For a single race. For people like 
you and me. And of the three 
items, knowledge perhaps would 
be the greatest prize of all, for 
knowledge, added to and compounded, correlated and coordinated, would lead to even greater 
wealth and power . . . and to 
greater knowledge." 

"It is madness," said Sutton. 
"You and I, Trevor, will be drifting dust, and not only ourselves, 



130

but the very era in which we live 
out this moment will be forgotten 
before the job is done." 

"Remember the corporation." 

"I'm remembering the corporation," Sutton said, "but I can't 
help but think in terms of people. 
You and I and the other people 
like us." 

"Let's think in terms of people, 
then," said Trevor, smoothly. 
"One day the life that runs in you 
will run in the brain and blood 
and muscle of a man who shall be 
part owner of the universe. There 
will be trillions upon trillions of 
life-forms to serve him, there will 
be wealth that he cannot count, 
there will be knowledge of which 
you and I cannot even dream." 

Sutton sat quietly, taut in his 
chair. 

"You're the only man," said 
Trevor, "who is standing in the 
way. You're the man who is blocking the project for a million years." 

"You need destiny," said Sutton, 
"and destiny is not mine to give 
away." 

"You are a human being, Sutton," Trevor told him, talking 
evenly. "You are a man. It is the 
people of your own race that I'm 
talking to you about." 

"Destiny," said Sutton, "belongs to everything that lives. Not 
to Man alone, but to every form of 
life." 

"It needn't," Trevor contradicted. "You are the only man 
who knows. You are the man who 



can tell the facts. You can make 
it a manifest destiny for the human 
race instead of a personal destiny 
for every crawling, cackling, sniveling thing that has the gift of 
life." 

Sutton didn't answer. 

"One word from you," said 
Trevor, "and the .thing is done." 

"It can't be done," said Sutton. 
"This scheme of yours — think of 
the sheer time, the thousands of 
years, even at the rate of speed of 
the star-ships of today, to cross intergalactic space. Only from this 
galaxy to the next . . . not from 
this to the outermost galaxy." 

TREVOR sighed. "You forget 
what I said about the compounding of knowledge. Two and 
two won't make four, my friend. It 
will make much more than four. In 
some instances thousands of times 
more than four." 

Sutton shook his head, wearily. 
But Trevor was right, he knew. 
Knowledge and technique would 
pyramid exactly as he said. Even, 
once Man had the time to do it, 
the knowledge in a single galaxy 
alone ... * 

"One word from you," said 
Trevor, "and the war is at an end. 
One word and the security of the 
human race is guaranteed forever. 
For all the race will need is the 
knowledge that you can give it." 
"It wouldn't be the truth." 
"That," replied Trevor, "doesn't 
have a thing to do with it." 



TIME QUARRY

"You don't need manifest destiny," said Sutton, "to carry out 
your project." 

"We have to have the human 
race behind us. We have to have 
something that is big enough to 
capture their imagination. Something important enough to make 
them pay attention. And manifest 
destiny — manifest destiny as it applies to the universe — is the thing 
to turn the trick." 

"Thirty years ago," said Sutton, 
"I might have thrown in with 
you." 

"And now?" asked Trevor. 

Sutton shook his head. "Not 
now. I know more than I did 
thirty years ago. Thirty years ago 
I was a human, Trevor. I'm not too 
sure I'm entirely human any 
longer." 

"I hadn't mentioned the matter 
of reward," said Trevor. "That 
goes without saying." 

"No, thanks," said Sutton. "I'd 
like to keep on living." 

Trevor flipped a clip at the ink 
well and it missed. 

"You're slipping," Sutton said. 
"Your percentage is way off." 

Trevor picked up another clip. 

"All right," he said. '.'Go ahead 
and have your fun. There's a war 
on and we'll win that war. It's a 
hellish way to fight, but we're 
doing it the best we can. No war 
anywhere, no surface indication of 
war, for you understand the galaxy 
is in utter and absolute peace under the rule of benevolent Earth


men. We can win without you, 
Sutton, but it would be easier with 
you." 

"You're going to turn me 
loose?" Sutton asked. 

"Why, sure," Trevor told him. 
"Go on out and beat your head 
against a stone wall a. little longer. 
In the end, you'll get tired of it. 
Eventually you'll give up out of 
sheer exhaustion. You'll come 
back then and give us the thing we 
want." 

Sutton rose to his feet. 

He stood for a moment, indecisive. 

"What are you waiting for?" 
asked Trevor. 

"One thing has me puzzled," 
Sutton answered. "The book, 
somehow, somewhere, already has 
been written. It has been a fact for 
almost five hundred years. How 
are you going to change that? If 
I write it now the way you want it 
written, it will change the human 
setup ..." 

Trevor laughed. "We got that 
one all figured out. Let us say that 
finally, after all of these years, the 
original of your manuscript is discovered. It can be readily and indisputably identified by certain 
characteristics which you will very 
carefully incorporate into it when 
you write it. It will be found and 
proclaimed, and what is more, 
proven . . . and the human race 
will have its destiny. 

"We'll explain the past unpleasantness by very convincing histori

cal evidence of earlier tampering 
with the manuscript. Even your 
friends, the androids, will have to 
believe what we say, once we get 
through with it." 

"Clever," Sutton admitted. 

"I think so, too," said Trevor. 

"Too bad you won't have a 
chance to try it," Sutton said. 

XLI 

AT THE building's entrance 
a man was waiting for him. 
He raised his hand in what 
might have been a brief salute. 
"Just a minute, (Mr. Sutton." 
"Yes, what is it?" 
"There'll be a few of us following you, sir. Orders, you know." 
"But. ..." 

"Nothing personal, sir. We 
won't interfere with anything you 
want to do. Just guarding you, 
sir." 

"Guarding me?" 
"Certainly, sir. Morgan's crowd, 
you know. Can't let them kill you 

off." 

"You can't know," Sutton told 
him, "how deeply I appreciate your 
interest." 

"It's nothing, sir," the man told 
him. "Just part of the day's work. 
. Glad to do it. Don't mention it at 
all." 

He stepped back again and Sutton wheeled and walked down the 
steps and followed the cinder walk 
that flanked the avenue. 

The Sun was near to setting. 



Looking back over his shoulder, 
he saw the tall, straight lines of 
the gigantic office building in 
which he had talked to Trevor outlined against the brightness of the 
western sky. But of anyone who 
might be following him he did not 
see a sign. 

He 'had no place to go. He had 
no idea where to go. But he realized that he couldn't stand around 
feeling lost. He'd walk, he told 
himself, and think, and wait for 
whatever was going to happen 
next to happen. 

He met other walkers and a few 
of them stared at him curiously and 
now, for the first time, Sutton realized that he still wore the clothing 
of a twentieth-century farm hand 
. . . blue denim overalls and cotton shirt, with heavy, serviceable 
farm shoes on his feet. 

But here, he knew, even such 
an outlandish costume would not 
arouse undue suspicion. For on 
Earth, with its visiting dignitaries 
from far solar systems, with its 
Babel of races employed in the 
different governmental departments, with its exchange students, 
its diplomats and legislators representing backwoods planets, how 
a man dressed would arouse but 
slight curiosity. 

By morning, he told himself, 
he'd have to find some hiding 
place, some retreat where he could 
relax and figure out some of the 
angles in this world of five hundred years ahead. 



TIME QUARRY

Either that or locate an android 
he could trust to put him in touch 
with the android organization . . . 
for although he had never been 
told so, he had no doubt there was 
an android organization. There 
would have to be to fight a war 
in time. 

HE TURNED off the path that 
flanked the roadway and took 
another one, a faint footpath that 
led out across marshy land toward 
a range of low hills. 

Suddenly now he realized that 
he was hungry and that he should 
have dropped into one of the 
shops in the office building for a 
bite of food. And then he remembered that he had no money with 
which to pay for food. A few 
twentieth-century dollars were in 
his pockets, but they would be 
worthless here as a medium of exchange, although quite possibly 
they might be collectors' items. 



Short hourt ago, he thought, 
he had walked a dusty 'hilltop road 
in the twentieth century, scuffing 
the white dust with his shoes . . . 
and some of the white dust, he 
saw, still clung to the leather. 
Even as the memory of that hilltop 
road still clung to his memory. 
Memory and dust, he thought, 
link us to the past. 

He reached the hills and began 
to climb them and the night was 
sweet with the smell of pine. 

He came to the top of a slight 
rise and stood there for a moment, 
looking out across the velvety softness of the night. Somewhere, near 
at hand, a cricket was tentatively 
tuning up his fiddle, and from the 
marsh came the muted sound of 
frogs. In the darkness just ahead 
of him, a stream was splashing 
along its rocky bed and it talked 
as it went along, talked to the 
trees and its grassy banks and the 
nodding flowers above them.

"I would like to stop," it said. 
"I would like to stop and talk with 
y-Qu. But I can't, you see. I must 
hurry on. I have some place I 
must go. I can't waste a minute. I 
must hurry on." 

Like Man, thought Sutton. For 
Man is driven like the stream. Man 
is driven by circumstance and 
necessity and the bright-eyed am


never reached its mark. A charging body slammed into his knees 
and drove them inward under him. 
Arms wrapped themselves around 
his legs and he staggered, falling 
on his face. 

He sat up and somewhere off 
to the right he heard the soft 
snickering of rapidly firing guns 
and caught, out of the tail of his 




bition of other restless men who 
will not let them be. 

He did not hear a sound, but 
he felt the great hand close upon 
his arm and yank him off the path. 
Twisting, he sought to free himself of the grasp, and saw the dark 
blur of the man who had grabbed 
him. He balled his fist and swung 
it and it was a sledge-hammer 
slamming at the dark head, but it 



eyes, their bright flicker in the 
night. 

Then a hand came out of nowhere and cupped itself around 
his mouth and nose. 

"Sleeping powder!" he thought. 
"Must hold my breath . . ." 

And even as he thought it, the 
dark figures in the woods, the 
cheeping frogs and the snarling of 
the guns fused into silence.

XLII 

SUTTON opened his eyes to 
strangeness and lay quietly 
on the bed. A breeze came 
through an open window and the 
room, decorated with fantastic 
life-murals, was splashed with 
brilliant sunlight. The breeze 
brought in the scent of blooming 
flowers and in a tree outside a 
bird was chirping contentedly. 

Slowly Sutton let his senses 
reach out and gather in the facts 
of the room, the facts of strangeness . . . the unfamiliar furniture, 
the contour of the room itself, the 
green and purple monkeys that 
chased one another along the wavy 
vine that ran around the border of 
the walls. 

Quietly his mind moved back 
along the track of time to his final 
conscious moment. There had been 
guns flickering in the night and 
there had been a hand that reached 
out and cupped his nose. 

Drugged, Sutton told himself. 
Drugged and dragged away. 

Before that there had been a 
cricket and the frogs singing in 
the marsh and the talking brook 
that babbled down the hill, hurrying to get wherever it was going. 

And before that a man had sat 
across a desk from him and told 
him about a corporation and a 
dream and a plan the corporation 
held. i . 

Fantastic, Sutton thought. And 
in the bright light of the room, 



the very idea was one of utter 
fantasy . . . that Man should go 
out, not only to the stars, but to 
the other galaxies, and plan a 
million years ahead. 

But there was greatness in it, a 
very human greatness. There had 
been a time when it had been fantasy to think that Man could ever 
lift himself from the bosom of 
the planet of his birth. And another time when it had been fantasy to think that Man would go 
beyond the solar system, out into 
the dread reaches of nothingness 
that stretched between the stars. 
And through time itself. . . fc 

But there had been strength in 
Trevor, and conviction as well as 
strength. A man who knew where 
he was going and why he was going and what it took to get there. 

Manifest destiny, Trevor had 
said. That is what it takes. That 
is what it needs. 

Man would be almost a god. 
The concepts of life and thought 
that had been born on the Earth 
would be the basic concepts of the 
entire universe, of the fragile 
bubble of space and time that 
bobbed along on a sea of mystery 
beyond which no mind could penetrate. And yet, by the time that 
Man got where he was headed for, 
he might well be able to penetrate 
that, too. 

A MIRROR stood in one corner 
of the room and in it he 
saw the reflection of the lower 



136 




 



half of his body, lying on the bed, 
naked except for a pair of shorts. 
He wiggled his toes and watched 
them in the glass. 

And you're the only one who is 
stopping us, Trevor had told him. 
You're the one man standing in 
the way of Man. You're the stumbling block. You are keeping men 
from being gods. 

But all men did not think as 
Trevor did. All men were not 
tangled in the blind chauvinism of 
the human race. 

Always there are men who know 
that humanity is a single race, men 
who refuse to exploit other forms 
of life. Teachers. Missionaries. 
Vegetarians. Ordinary feeling human beings. 

Even in his time, there had been 
men who treated androids sympathetically and Sutton had been one 
of them, though he knew now that 
it was the sympathy of the master 
for the underdog. The androids 
had not misunderstood; they knew 
it wasn't equality that was offered 
or would be granted, that sympathy could turn to savage reprisal if they acted as equals. Occasionally one would, swaggering 
and belligerent in the way of the 
frightened and insecure, and his 
ghastly fate served as example to 
others who might, as the saying 
went, get out of hand. 

For the human race, thought 
Sutton, cannot even for a moment 
forget that it is human, cannot 
achieve the greatness of humility 



that will unquestioningly accord 
equality. Even while the humane 
argue for the equality of androids, 
they cannot help but patronize the 
very ones that they would make 
equal. 

What was it Herkimer had 
said? Equality not by edict, not 
by human tolerance. But that was 
the only way the human race 
would ever accord equality . . . 
by edict, by dispensation, a gesture of tolerance where there was 
none, actually. 

AND yet, thought Sutton, there 
is Eva Armour. 
There may be others like her. 
Somewhere, working with the androids even now, there may be 
others like her. 

He swung his feet out of bed 
and sat on the bed's edge. A pair 
of slippers stood on the floor and 
he worked his feet into them, stood 
up and walked to the mirror. 

A strange face stared back at 
him, a face he'd never seen before, and for a moment muddy 
panic surged within his brain. 

Then, sudden suspicion blossoming, his hand went up to his 
forehead and rubbed at the smudge 
that was there, set obliquely 
across his brow. 

Bending low, with his face 
close to the mirror, he verified the 
thought. 

The smudge upon his brow was 
an android identification mark! An 
identification key and number! 



TIME 9UARRY 



137 



WITH his fingers he carefully 
explored his face, located 
the plastic coatings of flesh that 
had changed its contours until he 
was unrecognizable. 

He turned around, made his 
way 'back to the bed, sat down 
upon it cautiously and gripped the 
edge of the mattress with his 
.hands. 

Disguised, he told himself. 
Made into an android.. Kidnaped 
a human and an android when he 
woke. 

The door clicked and Herkimer 
said: "Good morning, sir. I trust 
that you are comfortable." 

Sutton jerked erect. "So it was 
you," he said. 

Herkimer nodded happily. "At 
your service, sir. Is there anything 
you wish?" 

"You didn't have to knock me 
out," said Sutton. "This is the 
second time. I'm getting tired of 
it." 

"We had to work fast, sir," said 
Herkimer. "We couldn't have you 
messing up things, stumbling 
around and asking questions and 
wanting to know what it was all 
about. We just drugged you and 
hauled you off. It was, believe me, 
sir, much simpler that way." 

"There was some shooting," 
Sutton said. "I heard the guns." 

"It seems," Herkimer told him, 
"that there were a few Revisionists 
lurking about, and it gets a little 
complicated, sir, when one tries to 
explain during a fight." 



"You tangle with those Revisionists?" 

"Well, to tell the truth," said 
Herkimer, "some of them were so 
rash as to draw their guns. It was 
most unwise of them, sir. They 
got the worst of it." 

"It won't do us a bit of good," 
said Sutton, "if the idea was to 
get me out of the clutches of Trevor's mob. Trevor will have a psych 
tracer on me. He knows where I 
am and this place will be watched 
three deep." 

Herkimer grinned. "It is, sir. 
His men are practically bumping 
into one another all around the 
place." 

"Then why this get-up?" Sutton demanded angrily. "Why 
disguise me?" 

"Well, sir," explained Herkimer, "it's like this. We figured no 
human in his right mind ever 
would want to be taken for an 
android. So we turned you into 
one. They'll be looking for a human. It would never occur to them 
to take a second look at an android 
when they were looking for a human." 

Sutton grunted. "Smart,"- he 
said. "I hope it doesn't. . . ." 

."Oh, they'll get onto it after a 
while, sir," Herkimer admitted, 
cheerfully. "But it will give us 
some time. Time to work out some 
plans." 

He moved swiftly around the 
room, opening chest drawers and 
taking out clothing. 



138 




 



"It's very nice, sir," he said, "to 
have you back again. We tried to 
■find you, but it was no dice. We 
figured the Revisionists had you 
cooped up somewhere, so we redoubled our security here and kept 
a close watch on everything that 
happened. For the past five weeks 
we've known every move that 
Trevor and his gang has made." 

"Five weeks!" gasped Sutton. 
"Did you say five weeks?" 

"Certainly, sir. Five weeks. You 
disappeared just seven weeks ago." 

"By my calendar," said Sutton, 
"it was ten years." 

Herkimer wagged his head sagely, unstartled. "Time is the 
funniest thing, sir. There's just no 
way to make subjective and objective time come out right." 

He laid clothing on the bed. "I£ 
you'll get into these, sir, we'll go 
down for breakfast. Eva is waiting 
— and will be glad to see you." 

XLIII 

TREVOR missed with three 
clips in a row. He flung 
the rest of them down on 
the desk. 

"You're sure of this?" he asked 
the man across the desk. 

The man nodded, tight-lipped. 
"It might be android propaganda, you know," said Trevor. 
"They're clever. That's a thing you 
never must forget. An android, for 
all his bowing and his scraping, is 
just as smart as we are." 



"Do you realize what it means?" 
the man demanded. "It means. . . ." 

"I can tell you what it means," 
said Trevor. "From now on we 
can't be sure which of us are human. There'll be no sure way of 
knowing who's a human and who's 
an android. You could be an android. I could be. . . ." 

"Exactly," said the man. 

"That's why Sutton was so smug 
yesterday afternoon," said Trevor. 
"He sat there, where you are sitting, and I had the impression that 
he was laughing at me all the 
time. . . ." 

"I don't think Sutton knows," 
said the man. "It's an android 
secret. Only a few of them know 
it. They certainly wouldn't take a 
chance on any human knowing it." 

"Not even Sutton?" 

"Not even Sutton," said the 
man. 

"Cradle," said Trevor. "Nice 
sense of fitness they have." 

"You're going to do something 
about it, certainly," said the man 
impatiently. 

Trevor put his elbows on the 
desk and matched fingertips. 

"Of course I am," he said. "Do 
you think I'd ever sit back and not 
do something?"

EVA ARMOUR rose from 
the table on the patio and 
held out both her hands in 
greeting. Sutton pulled her close to

him, planted a kiss on her upturned lips. 

"That," he said, "is for the million times I have thought of you." 

She laughed at him, suddenly 
gay and happy. 

"Now, Ash, a million times?" 

"Tangled time," said Herkimer. 
"He's been away ten years." 

"Oh," said Eva. "Oh, Ash, how 
horrible!" 

He grinned at her. "Not too 
horrible. I had ten years of rest. 
Ten years of peace and quiet. 
Working on a farm, you know. It 
was a little rough at first, but I was 
actually sorry when I had to leave. 
Except that it meant coming back 
to you." 

He held a chair for her, took 
one himself between her and 
Herkimer. 

They ate . . . ham and eggs, 
toast and marmalade, strong, black 
coffee. It was pleasant on the patio. 
In the trees above them birds 
quarreled amiably. In the clover at 
the edge of the bricks and stones 
that formed the paving, bees hummed among the blossoms. 

"How do you like my place, 
Ash?" asked Eva. 

"It's wonderful," he said, and 
then, as if the two ideas might be 
connected in some way, he added, 
"I saw Trevor yesterday. He took 
me to the mountain top and 
showed me the universe." 

Eva drew in her breath sharply, 
and Sutton looked up quickly from 
his plate. Herkimer was waiting 



with drawn face, with fork poised 
in mid-air, halfway to his mouth. 

"What's the matter with you 
two?" Sutton asked, offended. 
"Don't you trust me?" 

And even as he, asked the question, he answered it himself. Of 
course they wouldn't trust him. He 
was human and he could betray 
his own beliefs. He could twist 
destiny so that it was a thing for 
the human race alone. And there 
was no way in which they could 
be sure that he would not do this. 
Why should 'they trust a man who 
still felt uncomfortable and patronizing eating with an android? For 
he did, even now, though he was 
ashamed and blamed a lifetime of 
conditioning. 

"Ash," said Eva, "you refused 
to. ..." 

"I left Trevor with an idea that 
I would be back to talk it over. 
Nothing that I said or did. He just 
believes I will. Told me to go out 
and beat my head against the wall 
some more." 

"You have thought about it, 
sir?" asked Herkimer. 

Sutton shook his head. "No. 
Not too much. I haven't sat down 
and mulled it over, if that is what 
you mean. It would have its points 
if I were merely human. Sometimes I frankly wonder how much 
of the human there may be left in 
me." 

"How much of it do you know, 
Ash?" Eva asked, speaking softly. 
Her eyes questioned him.

SUTTON scrubbed a hand 
across his forehead. "Most - of 
it, I think. I know about the war in 
time and how and why it's being 
fought. I know about myself. I 
have two bodies and two minds, or 
at least substitute bodies and 
minds. I know some of the things 
that I can do. There may be other 
abilities I do not know about. One 
grows into them. Each new thing 
comes hard." 

"We couldn't tell you," Eva 
said. "It would have been so simple if we could have told you. To 
start with, you would not have believed the things we told you. 
And, when dealing with time, one 
interferes as little as possible. Just 
enough to turn an event in the 
right direction. 

"I tried to warn you. Remember, 
Ash? As near as I could come to 
warning." 

He nodded. "After I killed Benton in the Zag House. You told 
m.- you had studied me for twenty 
years." 

"And, remember, I was the little 
girl in the checkered apron." 

He looked at her in surprise. 
"You knew about that? It wasn't 
just part of the Zag dream?" 

"Identification planted by suggestion," said Herkimer. "So that 
you could identify Eva as a friend, 
as someone you had known before 
and who was close to you. So that 
you would accept her and whatever 
help she was allowed to offer." 

"But it was a dream." 



"A Zag dream," said Herkimer. 
"The Zag is one of us. His race 
would benefit if destiny can stand 
for everyone and not the human 
race alone." 




UTTON said: "Trevor is too 
' confident. Not just pretending 



to be confident, but really confident. I keep coming back to that 
remark he made. Go out, he said, 
and butt your head some more." 

"He's counting on you as a 
human being," Eva said. 

Sutton shook his head. "I can't 
think that's it. He must have some 
scheme up his sleeve, some 
maneuver that we won't be able to 
check." 

Herkimer spoke slowly. "I don't 
like that, sir. The war's not going 
too well as it is. If we had to win, 
we'd be lost right now." 

"If we had to win? I don't understand . . ." 

"We don't have to win, sir," 
said Herkimer. "All we have to 
do is fight a holding action, prevent the Revisionists from destroying the book as you will write it. 
From the very first we have not 
tried to change a single entry. 
We've tried to keep them from 
being changed." 

Sutton nodded. "On his part, 
Trevor has to win decisively. He 
must smash the original text, either 
prevent it from being written as I 
mean to write it or discredit it so 
thoroughly that not even an android 
will believe it."

"You're right, sir," Herkimer 
told him. "Unless he can do that, 
the humans cannot claim destiny 
for their own, cannot make other 
life believe that destiny is reserved 
for the human race alone." 

"And that is all he wants," said 
Eva. "Not the destiny itself, for no 
human can have the faith in destiny 
that say, for example, an android 
can. To Trevor it is merely a matter of propaganda ... to make the 
human race believe so completely 
that it is destined that it will not 
rest until it holds the universe." 

"So long," said Herkimer, "as 
we can keep him from doing that, 
we can state that we are winning. 
But the issue is so finely balanced 
that a new approach by either side 
would score heavily. A new weapon could be a factor that would 
mean victory or defeat." 

"I have a weapon," Sutton said. 
"A made-to-order weapon that 
would beat them . . . but there's 
no way that it can be used." 

Neither of them asked the question, but he saw it on their faces 
and 'he answered it. 

"There's only one such weapon. 
Only one gun. You can't fight a 
war with just one gun." 

Feet pounded around the corner 
of the house. When they turned, 
they saw an android running toward them across the patio. Dust 
stained his clothing and his face 
was red from running. He came to 
a stop and faced them, clutching at 
the table's edge. 



"They tried to kill me," he 
panted, the words coming out 
in gushes. "The place is surrounded . . ." 

"Andrew, you fool," snapped 
Herkimer. "What do you mean by 
running in like this? They will 
know ..." • 

"They've found out about the 
Cradle," Andrew gasped. "They 
know. . . ." 

Herkimer came erect in one swift 
motion. The chair on which he had 
been sitting tipped over with the 
violence of his rising and 'his face 
was suddenly so white that the 
identification tattoo on his forehead stood out with startling 
clearness. 

"They know where . . .?" 




NDREW shook his head. "Not 
• where. They just found out 



about it. Just now. We still have 
time . . ." 

"We'll call in all the ships," said 
Herkimer. "We'll have to pull all 
the guards off the crisis points . . ." 

"But you can't," cried Eva. 
"That's exactly what they would 
would want you to do. That is all 
that is stopping them . . ." 

"We have to," Herkimer said 
grimly. "There's no choice. If they 
destroy the Cradle ..." 

"Herkimer," said Eva, and there 
was a deadly calm in her unhurried 
words. "The mark!" 

Andrew swung around toward 
her, then took a backward step. 
Herkimer's hand flashed under


142 




 



neath his coat and Andrew turned 
to run, heading for the low wall 
that rimmed the patio. 

The knife in Herkimer's hand 
flashed in the Sun and was suddenly a spinning wheel that tracked 
the running android. It caught him 
before he reached the wall and he 
went down into a heap of huddled 
clothing. 

The knife, Sutton saw, was neatly 
buried in his neck. 

XLV 

t CTT TT AVE you noticed, sir," 
I — I said Herkimer, "how 
the little things, the 
inconsequential, trivial factors come 
to play so big a part in any happening?" 

He touched the huddled body 
with his foot. 

"Perfect," he said. "Absolutely 
perfect. Except that before reporting to us, he should have smeared 
some lacquer over his identification 
mark. Many androids do it in an 
attempt to hide the mark, but it's 
seldom much of a success. After 
only a short time, the mark shows 
through." 

"But lacquer?" asked Sutton. 

"A little code we have," said 
Herkimer. "A very simple thing. 
It's the recognition sign for an 
agent reporting. A password, as it 
were. It takes a moment only. Some 
lacquer on your finger and a smear 
across your forehead." 

"So simple a thing," said Eva, 



"that no one, absolutely no one, 
would ever notice it." 

Sutton nodded. "One of Trevor's 
men ?" 

Herkimer nodded. "Impersonating one of our men. Sent to smoke 
us out. Sent to start us running, 
panicked to save the Cradle." 

"This Cradle. . . ." 

"But it means," said Eva, "that 
Trevor knows about it. He doesn't 
know where it is, but he knows 
about it. And he'll hunt until he 
finds it and then. . . ." 

Herkimer's gesture stopped her. 

"What is wrong?" asked Sutton. 

For there was something wrong, 
something that was terribly wrong. 
The whole atmosphere of the place 
had grown harsh. The friendliness 
was gone . . . the trust and friendliness and the oneness of their purpose. Shattered by an android who 
had run across the patio and talked 
about a thing that he called a Cradle and died, seconds later, with a 
knife blade through his throat. 

Instinctively Sutton's mind 
reached out for Herkimer and then 
he drew it back. It was not an 
ability, he told himself, that one 
used upon a friend. It was an ability that one must keep in trust, not 
to be used curiously or idly, but 
only where the end result would 
justify its use. 

"What's gone sour?" he asked. 
"What is the matter?" 

"Sir," said Herkimer, "ybU are a 
human being and this is ah android 
matter." 



TIME QUARRY

For a moment Sutton stood stiff 
and straight, his mind absorbing 
the shock of the words that Herkimer had spoken, the black fury 
boiling ice cold inside his body. 

Then, deliberately, as if he had 
planned to do it, as if it was an 
action he had decided upon after 
long consideration, he made a tight 
fist and swung his arm. 

It was a vicious blow, with all 
his weight and all his strength and 
anger back of it, and Herkimer 
went down like an ox beneath a 
hammer. 

"Ash!" cried Eva. 

She clutched at his arm, but he 
shook her off. 



HERKIMER was sitting up, his 
hands covering his face, blood 
dripping down between his fingers. 

Sutton spoke to him. "I have not 
sold destiny, nor do I intend to 
sell it. Although, God knows, if I 
did, it would be no more than the 
lot of you deserve." 

"Ash," said Eva softly. "Ash, 
we must be sure." 

"How can I make you sure?" he 
asked. "I can only tell you." 

"They are your people, Ash," 
she said. "Your race. Their greatness is your greatness, too. You 
can't blame Herkimer for think


ing. 



"They're your people, too," said 




144 




 



Sutton. "The taint that applies to 
me applies to you as well." 

She shook her head. 

"I'm a special case," she said. "I 
was orphaned when I was only a 
few weeks old. The family androids 
took me over. They raised me. 
Herkimer was one of them. I'm 
much more an android, Ash, than 
I am a human being." 

Herkimer was still sitting on the 
grass, beside the sprawled, dead 
body of Trevor's agent. He did 
not take his hands from his face. 
He made no sign that he was going 
to. The blood still dripped down 
between his finger and trickled 
down his arms. 

Sutton said to Eva: "It was very 
nice to see you again. And thank 
you for the breakfast." 

He turned on his heel and 
walked away, across the patio and 
over the low wall and out into the 
path that led down to the road. 

He heard Eva cry out for him to 
stop, but he pretended not to hear 
her. 

I was raised by androids, she had 
said. And he had been raised by 
Buster, a robot, not even an android. By Buster, who had taught 
him how to fight when the kid 
down the road had given him a 
licking. Buster, who had whaled 
him good and proper for eating 
green apples. By Buster, who had 
gone out, five hundred years before, to homestead a planet. 

Sutton walked with the icy fury 
still running in his blood. They 




TIME QUARRY 



145 



didn't trust me, he said. They 
thought I might sell out. After all 
the years of waiting, after all the 
years of planning and of thinking. 

"Johnny," he said. 

"What is it, Ash?" 

"What's going on, Johnny? 
What about all this?" 

"You're a stinker, Ash." 

"To hell with you," said Sutton. 
"You and all the rest of them." 

Trevor's men, he knew, must be 
around the house, watching and 
waiting. He expected to be stopped. 
But he wasn't stopped. He didn't 
see a soul. 

XLVI 




UTTON stepped into the 
visor booth and closed the 
door behind him. From the 



rack along the wall, he took out 
the directory and hunted up the 
number. He dialed and snapped the 
toggle and there was a robot on 
the screen. 

"Information," said the robot, 
his eyes seeking out the forehead 
of the man who called. Since it was 
an android, he dropped the customary "sir." 

"Information. Records. What 
can I do for you ?" 

"Is there any possibility," asked 
Sutton, "that this call could be 
tapped?" 

"None," said the robot. "Absolutely none. You see . . ." 

"I want to see the homestead 
filings for the year 7990." 



"Earth filings?" 
Sutton nodded. 

"Just a moment," said the 
robot. 

Sutton waited, watching the 
robot select the proper spool and 
mount it on the viewer. 

"They are arranged alphabetically," said the robot. "What name 
did you wish?" 

"The name begins with 'S'," 
said Sutton. "Let me see the 'S's." 

The unwinding spool was a blur 
on the screen. It slowed momentarily at the "M"s, spun to the 
"P"s, then went more slowly. 

The "S" list dragged by. 

"Toward the end," said Sutton, 
and, finally, "Hold it." 

For there was the entry that hesought. 

Sutton, Buster . . . 

He read the planet description 
three times to make sure he had it 
firmly in his mind. 

"That's all," he said. "Thank 
you very much." 

The robot grumbled at him and 
shut off the screen. 

Outside again, Sutton ambled 
easily across the foyer of the office 
building he had selected to place 
his call. On the road outside, he 
walked up the road, branched off 
onto a path and found a bench 
with a pleasant view. 

He sat down on the bench and 
forced himself to relax. 

He was being watched, he knew. 
Kept under observation, 'for by 
this time, certainly, Trevor would 



146 




 



know that the android who had 
walked out of Eva Armour's house 
was actually Asher Sutton. The 
psych tracer long ago would have 
told the story, would have traced 
his movements and pin-pointed 
him for Trevor's men to watch. 

Take it easy, he told himself. 
Dawdle. Loaf. Act as if you didn't 
have a thing to do, as if you 
didn't have a thought in mind. 

You can't fool them, but you 
can at least catch them unguarded 
when you have to move. 

And there were many things to 
do, many things left to think 
about, although he was satisfied 
that the course of action he had 
planned was the course to take. 

He took them up, step by step, 
checking them over for any chance 
of slip-up. 

FIRST, back to Eva's house to 
get the manuscript notes he 
■had left on the hunting asteroid, 
notes that either Eva or Herkimer 
must have kept through all the 
years ... or was it only weeks? 

That would be a ticklish and embarrassing business at the best. But 
they were his notes, he told himself. They were his to claim. He 
had no commitments in this conflict. 

"I have come to get my notes. I 
suppose you still have them somewhere." 

Or — "Remember the attache case 
I had ? I wonder if you took care of 
it for me." 



Or — "I'm going on a trip. I'd 
appreciate my notes if you can lay 
jour hands on them." 

Or — 

But it was no use. However he 
might say it, whatever he might 
do, the first step would be to reclaim the notes. 

Dawdle up till then, he told 
himself. Work your way back toward the house until it's almost 
dark. Then get the notes and after 
that move fast — so fast that 
Trevor's gang can't catch up with 
you. 

Second was the ship, the ship 
that he must steal. 

He had spotted it earlier in the 
day while loafing at the area spaceport. Sleek and small, it would be 
a fast job, and the stiff, military 
bearing of the officer who had been 
directing the provisioning and refueling had been the final tip-off 
that it was the ship he wanted. 

Loafing outside the barrier fence, 
playing the part of an idly curious, 
no-good android, he had carefully 
entered the officer's mind. Ten minutes later, he was on his way, with 
the information that he needed. 

The ship did carry a time-warp 
unit. 

It was not taking off until the 
next morning. 

It would be guarded during the 
night. 

Without a doubt, Sutton told 
himself, one of Trevor's ships, one 
of the fighting warships of the Revisionists. 



TIME QUARRY 



147 



It would take nerve, he knew, to 
steal the ship. Nerve and fast footwork and a ' readiness and the 
ability to kill. 

Saunter out onto the field, as if 
he were waiting for an incoming 
ship, mingling with the crowd. 
Slip out of the crowd and walk 
across the field, acting as if he had 
a right to be there. Not run . . . 
walk. Run only if someone challenged him and made the challenge stick. Run then. Fight. Kill, 
if necessary. But get the ship. 

Get the ship and pile on the 
speed to the limit of endurance, 
heading in a direction away from 
his destination, driving the ship 
with everything that was in it. 

Two years out, or sooner if necessary, he would throw in the time 
unit, roll himself and the ship a 
couple of centuries into the past. 

Once in the past, he would have 
to ditch the motors, for undoubtedly they would have built-in recognition signals which could be 
traced. Unship them and let them 
travel in the direction he had been 
going. 

THEN take over the empty hull 
with his non-human body, 
swing around and head toward 
Buster's planet, still piling on the 
speed, building it up to that fantastic figure that was necessary to 
jump great interstellar spaces. 

" Vaguely he wondered how his 
body, how the drive of bis energyintake body, would compare with 



the actual motors in the long haul. 
Better, he decided. Better than the 
motors. Faster and stronger. 

But it would take years — many 
years of time, for Buster was far 
out. 

He listed the moves: 

Unshipping the engines would 
throw off pursuit. The pursuers 
would follow the recognition-signals in the motors, would spend 
long days in overhauling them before they discovered their mistake. 

Check. 

The time roll would unhook the 
contact of Trevor's psych tracers, 
for they could not operate through 
time. 

Check. 

By the time other tracers could 
be set in other times to find him, 
be would be so far out that the 
tracers would go insane trying to 
catch up on the time-lag of his 
whereabouts — if, in fact, they could 
ever find it in the vastness of the 
outer reaches of the galaxy ( 

Check. 

If it works, he thought. If it only 
works. If there isn't some sort of 
slip-up, some kind of unseen factor. 

A squirrel skipped across the 
grass, sat up on its haunches and 
took a long look at him. Then, deciding that he was not dangerous, 
it started a busy search in the grass 
for imaginary buried treasure. 

Cut loose, thought Sutton. Cut 
loose from everything that holds 
me. Cut loose and get the job 
done. Forget Trevor and his Re
visionists, forget Herkimer and the 
androids. Forget Eva. Get the book 
written. 

Trevor wants to buy me. Eva 
wants to use me; I'm nothing to 
her as a man. And the androids 
do not trust me. And Morgan, if 
he had the chance, would kill me. 

The androids do not trust me. 

That's foolish, he told himself. 

Childish. 

And yet they did not trust him. 
You are a human, Eva had told 
him. The humans are your people. 
I'm much more an android, Ash, 
than I am a human being. 

iHe shook his head, bewildered 
by the situation. 

There was one thing that stood 
out clearly. One thing he had to do. 
One obligation that was his and 
one that must be fulfilled or all 
else would be with utterly no 
meaning. 

There is a thing called destiny. 

The knowledge of that destiny 
has been granted me. Not as a human being, not as a member of" the 
human race, but as an instrument 
to transmit that knowledge to all 
other thinking life. 

I must write a book to do it. ■ 

I must make that book as clear 
and forceful and as honest as I 
can. 

Having done that, I shall have 
discharged my responsibility. 

Having done that, it does not 
matter what may happen to me. 

Having done that, there is no 
further claim upon me. 



A footstep sounded on the path 
back of the bench and Sutton 
turned around. 

"Mr. Sutton, isn't it?" said the 
man. 

Sutton nodded. 

"Sit down, Trevor," he said. 
"I've been expecting you." 

XLVII 

66~ytyOU didn't stay long 
^/ with your friends," said 
{, _ Trevor. 

Sutton shook his head. "We had 
a disagreement." 

"Something about this Cradle 
business?" 

"You might call it that," said 
Sutton. "It goes a good deal 
deeper. The fundamental prejudices 
rooted between androids and humans." 

"Herkimer killed an android 
who brought him a message about 
the Cradle," Trevor said. 

"He thought it was someone that 
you sent. Someone masquerading as 
an android. That is why he killed 
him." 

Trevor pursed his mouth sanctimoniously. "Too bad," he said. 
"Too bad. Mind telling me how 
he recognized the . . . might we 
call it the deception?" 

"That is something," Sutton said, 
"that you will have to figure out 
without my help." 

Trevor labored at -acting unconcerned. "The main point is," he 
said, "that it didn't work." 



TIME QUARRY 



151 



"You mean the androids didn't 
run helter-skelter for the Cradle 
and show you where itr was." 

Trevor nodded. "There was another angle to it, too. They might 
have pulled some of their guards 
off the crisis points. That would 
have helped us some." 

"Double-barreled," said Sutton. 
"Very shrewd." 

"Oh, most assuredly," agreed 
Trevor. "Nothing like getting the 
other fellow square behind the 
eight-ball." 

He squinted at Sutton's face. 

"Since when," he asked, "and 
why did you desert the human 
race?" 

Sutton put his hand up to his 
face, felt the resilience of the plastic that had remodeled his features 
into those of another person. 

"It was Herkimer's idea," he 
declared. "He thought it would 
make me hard to spot. You 
wouldn't be looking for an android, you know." 

Trevor nodded agreement. "It 
might have helped," he said. "It 
would have fooled us for a while, 
but when you walked away and the 
tracer followed you, we knew who 
you were." 

The squirrel came hopping across 
the grass and looked them over. 

"Sutton," Trevor asked, "how 
much do you know about this Cradle business?" 

"Nothing," Sutton replied. 
"They told me I was a human and 
it was an android matter." 



"You can see from that how 
important it must be." 

"I 'think I can," said Sutton. 

"You can guess, just from the 
name, what it might be." 

"That's not too hard to do." 

"Because we needed a greater 
force of humans," said Trevor, "we 
made the first androids a thousand 
years ago. We needed them to fill 
out the too-thin ranks of Mankind. 
We made them as close to humans 
as we could. They could do everything the humans could except one 
thing." 

"They can't reproduce," said 
Sutton. "I wonder, Trevor, assuming it had been possible, whether 
we would have given that power to 
them, too. If we had, they would 
have been true humans. There 
would have been no difference 
whatever between men whose ancestors were made in a laboratory 
and those whose ancestors stemmed 
back to the primal ocean. The androids would have been a self-continuing race, and they wouldn't 
have been androids. They would 
have been humans. We would have 
been adding to our population by 
biological as well as chemical 
means." 

'<T DON'T know," said Trevor. 

-L "Honestly, I don't. Of course, 
the wonder is that we could make 
them at all, that we could produce 
life in the laboratory. Think of the 
sheer intellectual ability and the 
technical skill that went into it. 



152 




 



For centuries men had tried to find 
out what life was, had run down 
one blind alley after another, getting nowhere near the secret at all. 
Failing in a scientific answer, many 
of them turned back to a divine 
source, to a mythical answer, to the 
belief that it was a matter of supernatural intervention. The idea is 
perfectly expressed by du Nouy, 
who wrote back in the twentieth 
century." 

"We gave the androids one thing 
we do not have ourselves," said 
Sutton, calmly. 

Trevor stared at him, suddenly 
hard, suddenly suspicious. 

"You. . . ." 

"We gave them inferiority," said 
Sutton. "We made them less than 
human and that gave them a reason 
to fight us. We denied them something they haye to fight to get . . . 
equality. We furnished them with a 
motive Man lost long ago, .though 
he still has a need to feel superior 
to other humans for some arbitrary 
and unimportant difference. Once 
it was religion, nationality, the 
color of the skin. Now it's the ability to reproduce." 

"They're equal now," said 
Trevor, bitterly. "The androids 
have been reproducing themselves 
. . . chemically, not biologically, 
for a long time now." 

"We should have expected it," 
said Sutton. 

"I suppose we should have," 
Trevor admitted. "We gave them 
the same brains we have ourselves. 



We gave them — or we tried to give 
them — a human perspective." 

"And we put a mark upon their 
foreheads." 

TREVOR made an angry motion 
with his hand. "That little matter is being taken care of now. 
When the androids make another 
android, they don't bother to put 
a mark upon his head." 

Sutton started as the thunder hit 
him . . . thunder that rolled and 
rumbled in his brain, a growing, 
painful, roaring thunder that shut 
out everything. 

He had said a weapon. He had 
said there was a weapon . . . 

"They could make themselves 
better than they were originally," 
continued Trevor. "They could improve upon the model. They could 
build a super-race, a mutant race, 
call it what you will . . ." 

Only one weapon, Sutton had 
said. And you can't fight with just 
one cannon. 

Sutton put a hand up to his forehead, rubbed hard against his brow. 

"Sure," said Trevor. "You can 
go nuts thinking about it. I have. 
You can conjure up all sorts of 
possibilities. They could push us 
out. The new pushing out the old." 

"The race would be human still," 
said Sutton. 

"We built slowly, Sutton. The 
old race. The biological race. We 
came up from the dawn of Man. 
We came up from chipped flints 
and fist axe, from the cave and the 



TIME QUARRY 



153 



treetop nest. We've built too slowly 
and painfully and bloodily to have 
our heritage taken from us by 
something to which that slowness 
and the pain and blood would 
mean not a thing at all." 

One gun, Sutton thought. But 
he had been wrong. There were a 
thousand guns, a million guns, 
to save destiny for all life that was 
or would be. Now or a millionbillion years from now. 

"I suppose," he said, shakily, 
"that you feel I should throw in 
with you." 

"I want you," said Trevor, "to 
find out for me where the Cradle 
is. You could get the androids to 
tell you." 

"So you can smash it." 

"So I can save humanity. The 
old humanity. The real humanity." 

"You feel that all humans 
should stick together now." 

"If you have a streak of human 
in you, you will be with us now." 

"There was a time," said Sutton, "back on Earth, before men 
went to the stars, when the human 
race was the most important thing 
the mind of Man could know. 
That isn't true any longer, Trevor. 
There are other races just as great. 
Either actually or potentially." 

"Each race," answered Trevor, 
"is loyal to its own. The human 
race must be loyal unto itself." 

"I am going to be traitor. I may 
be wrong, but I still think that 
destiny is greater than humanity." 
"You refuse to help us?" 



"Not only that," said Sutton. "I 
am going to fight you. If you want 
to kill me, Trevor, now's the time 
to do it. Because if you don't do 
it now, it will be too late." 

"J wouldn't kill you for all the 
worlds," Trevor assured him coldly. "I need the words you wrote. 
Despite you and the androids, Sutton, we'll read them the way we 
want them read. And so will all 
the other slimy, crawling things 
you admire so much. There's nothing in the whole universe that can 
stand before the human race, that 
can match the human race. . . ." 

Sutton saw loathing on his face. 

"I'm leaving you to yourself, 
Sutton," Trevor told him. "Your 
name will go down as the blackest 
blot in all of human history. The 
syllables of your name will be a 
sound that the last human will 
gag upon if he tries to speak it. 
Sutton will become a common 
noun with which one man will 
insult another. . . ." 

Trevor stood up and started to 
walk away and then turned back. 
His voice was not much more than 
a whisper, but it cut into Sutton's 
brain like a whetted knife. 

"Go and wash your face," he 
said. "Wash off the plastic and 
the mark. But you'll never be human again, Sutton. You'll never 
dare to call yourself a man again." 

He turned on his heel and 
walked away. Staring at his back, 
Sutton seemed to hear the sound 
of a slamming door.

XL VIII 

THERE was one lamp lighted in a corner of the room. 
The attache case lay on a 
table underneath the lamp and 
Eva Armour was standing beside 
a chair, as if she had been expecting him. 

"You came back," said Eva, "to 
get your notes. I have them ready 
for you." 

He stood just inside the door 
and shook his head. 

"Not yet," he said. "Later I 
will need the notes. Not right 
now." 

And there it was, he thought, 
the thing he had worried about 
that afternoon, the thing that he 
had tried to put in words. 

"I told you about a weapon at 
breakfast this morning," he went 
on. "You must remember what I 
said about it. I said there was only 
one weapon. I said you can't fight 
a war with just one gun." . 

Eva nodded, her lovely face 
drawn in the lamplight. "I remember, Ash." 

"There are a million of them," 
said Ash. "As many as you want. 
There's no limit to the number 
there can be." 

He moved slowly across the 
room until he stood face to face 
with her. 

"I am on your side," he told 
her, simply. "I saw Trevor this 
afternoon. He cursed me for all 
humanity." 



Slowly she put up a hand and 
he felt it slide across his face, the 
palm cool and smooth. Her fingers closed in his hair and she 
shook his head gently, tenderly. 

"Ash," she said, "you washed 
the plastic off your face. You are 
Ash again." 

He nodded. "I wanted to be 
human again." 

"Trevor told you about the 
Cradle, Ash?" 

"I'd guessed some of it," Sutton 
said. "He told me the rest. About 
the androids that wear no mark." 

"We use them as spies," she 
said, as if it were quite a natural 
thing to say. "We even have some 
of them in Trevor's headquarters. 
He thinks that they are human." 

"Herkimer?" he asked. 

"He isn't here, Ash. He wouldn't be here, after what happened 
out on the patio." 

"Of course," said Sutton. "Of 
course he wouldn't. Eva, we humans are such heels." 

"Sit down," she told him. "That 
chair over there. You talk so oddly 
that you scare me." 

He sat down. 

"Tell me what happened," she 
demanded. 

He didn't tell her. He said: "I 
thought of Herkimer this afternoon. When Trevor was talking 
with me. I hit Herkimer this morning and I would hit him tomorrow 
morning if he said the same thing 
to me. It's something in the human blood, Eva. We fought our 



TIME QUARRY

way up. With fist, axe and club 
and gun and atom bomb and. . . ." 

"Shut up," cried Eva. "Keep 
still, can't you?" 

He looked up at her in astonishment. 

"Human, you say," she said 
harshly. "And what is Herkimer 
if he isn't human? He is a human, 
made by humans. A robot can 
make another robot and they're 
still robots, aren't they? A human 
makes another human and both 
of them are humans." 

SUTTON mumbled, confused. 
"Trevor is afraid the androids 
will take over. That there will be 
no more humans. No more original, biological humans. . . ." 

"Ash," she said, "you are bothering yourself over something that 
there is no reason to fight. The 
Cradle will solve the secret of 
biological reproduction. Not for 
centuries, of course, but ultimately. 
What's the use of agonizing over 
a difference that eventually won't 
exist?" 

He shook his head. "I guess 
there is no use. It keeps stirring 
around in my head, though, accusing me of treason. Once it was so 
clear and simple. I would write a 
book and the galaxy would read 
it and accept it and everything 
would be just fine." 

"It still can be that way," she 
said. "After a while, after a long 
while. When Man stops believing 
that racial loyalty means the right 



to subjugate all other life. It will 
come, Ash, and humanity will be 
greater for it, allied to everything 
that lives, not an arrogant and 
fearful master." 

"Herkimer said one weapon 
would do it," Sutton said. "One 
weapon would be the balance that 
was needed. Eva, the androids have 
gone a long way in their research, 
haven't they? Chemical, I mean. 
The study of the human body. 
They would have to, to do what 
they have done." 

She nodded. "A long way, 
Ash." 

"They have a scanner ... a 
machine that could take a person 
apart, molecule by molecule, record it almost atom for atom. 
Make a blueprint for another 
body." 

"We've done that," said Eva. 
"We've duplicated men in Trevor's organization. Kidnaped them 
and blueprinted them and made a 
duplicate . . . sent him back the 
duplicate and placed the other under benevolent detention. It's only 
been through tricks like that that 
we've been able to hold our own 
at all." 

"You could duplicate me?" 
asked Sutton. 

"Certainly, Ash, but. . . ." 

"A different face, of course," 
said Sutton. "But a duplicate brain 
and . . . well, a few other things." 

Eva nodded. "Your special abilities." 

"I can get into another mind," 



15& 




 



said Sutton. "Not mere telepathy, 
but the actual power to be another 
person, to be that other mind, to 
see and know and feel the same 
things that the other mind may 
see or know or feel. I don't know 
how it's done, but it must be 
something inherent in the brain 
structure. If you duplicated my 
brain, the ability should go along 
with the duplication. Not all of 
the duplicates would have it, maybe, not all of them could use it, 
but some of them could." 

She gasped. "Ash, that would 
mean. . . ." 

( t~\7~OXJ would know every-L thing," said Sutton, "that 
Trevor thinks. Every word and 
thought that passes through his 
mind. Because one of you would 
be Trevor. And the same with 
every other person who has anything to do with the war in time. 
You would know as soon as they 
know what they're going to do. 
You could plan to meet any threat 
they might be considering. You 
could block them at everything 
they tried." 

"It would be stalemate," Eva 
said, "and that is exactly what we 
want. A strategy of stalemate, Ash. 
They wouldn't know how they 
were being blocked and many 
times they would not know who 
was blocking them. It would seem 
to them that luck was permanently against them . . . that destiny 
was against them." 



"Trevor himself gave me the 
idea," Sutton said. "He told me 
to go out and butt my head against 
a wall some more. He told me 
that finally I would get tired of 
doing it He said that after a 
while I would give up." 

"Ten years," said Eva. "Ten 
years should do the job. But if ten 
won't, why, then, a hundred. Or a 
thousand, if it must take that long. 
We have all the time there is." 

"Finally," said Sutton, "they 
would give up. Literally throw up 
their hands and quit. It would be 
such a futile thing. Never winning. Always fighting hard and 
never winning." 

They sat in the room with its 
one little oasis of light that stood 
guard against the darkness that 
pressed in upon them, and there 
was no triumph in them, for this 
was not a thing of triumph. Thi& 
was a matter of necessity, not one 
of conquest. This was Man fighting himself, and winning and losing at the same time. 

"You can arrange this scanning 
soon?" asked Sutton. 

"Tomorrow, Ash." She looked 
at him queerly. "What's your 
hurry?" 

"I am leaving," Sutton said. 
"Running away to a refuge that I 
thought of. That is, if you'll lend 
me a ship." 

"Any ship you want." 

"It would be more convenient 
that way," he told her. "Otherwise, I'd have to steal one."

She did not ask the question 
that he had expected and he went 
on: "I have to write the book." 

"There are plenty of places, 
Ash, where you could write the 
book. Safe places. Places that could 
be arranged to be foolproof safe." 

He shook his head. "There's an 
old robot. He's the only folks I 
have. When I was on Cygni, he 
went out to one of the star systems at the very edge and filed on 
a homestead. I am going there." 

"I understand," she said, speaking very softly. 

"There's just one thing," said 
Sutton. "I keep remembering a 
little girl who came and spoke to 
me when I was fishing. I know 
that she was a person conditioned 
in my mind. I know she was put 
there for a purpose, but it makes 
no difference. I keep thinking of 
her." 

He looked at Eva and saw how 
the lamplight turned her hair into 
a copper glory. 

"I don't know if I am still 
allowed to love," said Sutton. "I 
~ can't tell you for sure if I will 
always' be allowed to love you, 
Eva. But I wish you would go with 
me out to Buster's planet." 

"I can't," she cried. "Don't ask 
me to." 

"But I must. I've suffered 
enough alone. I deserve you, 
don't I?" 

Her eyes were misty in the 
lamplight. "Perhaps sometime, 
Ash, if you still want me. But 



there's this war that must not be 
lost. . . ." 

Sutton said, simply: "I'll always want you, Eva. The war can't 
be lost any more." 

She was against him, her lips 
to his, her words muffled and hungry. "I want to. Oh, I want to." 

XLIX 

SUTTON floated in a sea of 
light and from far away he 
heard the humming of the 
machines at work, little busy machines that were dissecting him 
with their tiny fingers of probing 
light and clicking shutters and the 
sensitive paper that ran like a 
streak of burnished silver through 
the holders. Dissecting and weighing, probing and measuring . . . 
missing nothing, adding nothing. 
A faithful record not of himself 
alone, but of every particle of him, 
of every cell and molecule, of 
every branching nerve and muscle 
fiber. 

And from somewhere else, also 
far away, from a place beyond the 
sea of light that held him, a voice 
said one word and kept repeating 
it: 

Traitor. 
Traitor. 
Traitor. 

One word without an exclamation point. A voice that had no 
emphasis. One flat word. 

First there had been one voice 
crying it and then another joined 



158 




 



and then there was a crowd and 
finally it was a roaring mob and 
the sound and word built up until 
it was a world of voices that were 
crying out the word. Crying out 
the word until there was no longer 
any meaning in it, until it had lost 
its meaning and become a sound 
being senselessly repeated. 

Sutton tried to answer and there 
was no answer nor any way to 
answer. He had no voice, for he 
had no lips or tongue or throat. 
He was an entity that floated in 
the sea of light and the word kept 
on, never changing . . . never 
stopping. 

But back of the word, a background to the word, there were 
other words unspoken. 

We are the ones who clicked 
the flints together and built the 
first fire of Man's own making. 
We are the ones who drove the 
beasts out of the caves and took 
them for ourselves, in which to 
shape the first pattern of a human 
civilization. We are the ones who 
painted the colorful bison on the 
hidden walls, working in the light 
of mud lamps with moss for wicks 
and animal fat for oil. We are the 
ones who tilled the soil and tamed 
the seed to grow beneath our hand. 
We are the ones who built great 
cities that our own kind might 
live together and accomplish the 
greatness that a handful could not 
even try. We are the ones who 
dreamed of stars — and broke the 
atom to the harness of our minds. 



It is our heritage you spend. It 
is our traditions that you give away 
to things that we have made, that 
we have fashioned with the deftness of our hands and the sharpness of our minds. 

The machines clicked on and 
the voice kept on with the one 
word it was saying. 

But there was another voice, 
deep within the undefinable being 
that was Asher Sutton, a faint 
voice. . . . 

It said no word, for there was 
no word that could frame the 
thought it formed. It made him 
kin to something far greater than 
a race of thinking, brawling, ambitious primates. It made him kin 
to all life . . . all life. 

Sutton answered it. "Thank you, 
Johnny. Thank you very much." 

And he was astonished that he 
could answer Johnny when he 
could not answer all the others. 

The machines went on with 
their clicking. 

L 

HERKIMER stood alone in 
the darkness underneath 
the trees and watched the 
two of them walk across the field 
toward the ship. 

She should have stayed, . he 
thought. He would have gone 
without her. He would not have 
guessed the real reason why she 
should have stayed. No more than 
he guesses even now that we sent 



TIME QUARRY

Buster out to the Tower stars 
many years ago to establish refuge 
for him — well knowing that the 
day might come when he would 
need that refuge. 

She had told him at first that 
she couldn't go with him. She 
should have stuck it out, thought 
Herkimer. But she is too human. 
That is the trouble with all of us. 
— we are too human. 

Out on the tiny field, fire flickered in the mouths of the tubes 
and the silvery ship lurched down 
the launching ramp. Gathering 
speed, it slammed along the upcurve and hurled itself into the 
sky, a breath of fire that blazed 
against the night. 



Herkimer stood with tilted head 
and watched it until it was a tiny 
pinpoint of light that was fleeing 
spaceward. 

He lifted a hand hesitantly, half 
doubting the fitness of a parting 
gesture. 

"Good-by, Ash," he said underneath his breath. "Good-by, 
Ash. God bless you, Eva." 

Standing there, he had a hopeful thought. 

Perhaps, he told himself, Sutton 
never will learn she is an android 
woman. But he knew then that 
Eva would tell the truth and that 
it would not change Sutton's love 
for her.
