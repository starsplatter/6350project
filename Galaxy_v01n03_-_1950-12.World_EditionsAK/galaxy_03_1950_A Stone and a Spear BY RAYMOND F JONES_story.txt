A Stone and a Spear BY RAYMOND F. JONES 



FROM Frederick to Baltimore, the rolling Maryland 
countryside lay under a 
fresh blanket of green. Wholly 
unaware of the summer glory, Dr. 
Curtis Johnson drove swiftly on 
the undulating highway, stirring 
clouds of dust and dried grasses. 

Beside him, his wife, Louise, 
held her blowing hair away from 
her face and laughed into the 
warm air. "Dr. Dell isn't going 
to run away. Besides, you said we 
could call this a weekend vacation 
as well as a business trip." 

Curt glanced at the speedometer 
and eased the pressure on the 
pedal. He grinned. "Wool-gathering again." 

"What about?" 

"I was just wondering who said 
it first — one of the fellows at Detrick, or that lieutenant at Bikini, 
"Said what? What are you talking about?" 

"That crack about the weapons 
after the next war. He — whoever 
it was — said there may be some 
doubt about what the weapons of 
the next war will be like, but 
there is absolutely no doubt about 
the weapons of World War IV. 
It will be fought with stones and 
spears. I guess any one of us 
could have said it." 

Louise's smile grew tight and 
thin. "Don't any of you ever think 
of anything but the next war — 
any of you?" 

"How can we? We're fighting 
it right now." 

"You make it sound so hopeless." 

"That's what Dell said in the 
days just before he quit. He said 
we didn't have to stay at Detrick 
producing the toxins and aerosols 
that will destroy millions of lives. 
But he never showed us how we 
could quit — and be sure of staying alive. His own walking out 
was no more than a futile gesture." 

"I just can't understand him, 
Curt. I think he's right in a way, 
but what brought him to that viewpoint?" 

"Hard to tell," Curt said, unconsciously speeding up again. 
"After the war, when the atomic 
scientists were publicly examining 
their consciences, Dell told them 
to examine their own guts first. 
That was typical of him then, but 



soon after, he swung just as 
strongly pacifist and walked out 
of Detrick." 

"It still seems strange that he 
abandoned his whole career. The 
world's foremost biochemist giving up the laboratory for a truck 
farm!" Louise glanced down at 
the lunch basket between them. 
In it were tomatoes that Dr. 
Hamon Dell had sent along with 
his invitation to visit him. 

FOR nearly a year Dr. Dell had 
been sending packages of 
choice fruit and vegetables to his 
former colleagues, not only at the 
biological warfare center at Camp 
Detrick but at the universities and 
other research centers throughout 
the country. 

"I wish we knew exactly why 
he asked us to come out," said 
Louise. 

"Nobody claims to have figured 
him out. They laugh a little at 
him now. They eat his gifts willingly enough, but consider him 
slightly off his rocker. He still has 
all his biological talents, though. 
I've never seen or tasted vegetables 
like the ones he grows." 

"And the brass at Detrick 
doesn't think he's gone soft in 
the head, either," she added much 
too innocently. "So they ordered 
you to take advantage of his invitation and try to persuade him to 
come back." 

Curt turned his head so sharply that Louise laughed.

"No, I didn't read any secret, 
hush-hush papers," she said. "But 
it's pretty obvious, isn't it, the way 
you rushed right over to General 
Hansen after you got the invitation?" 

"It is hush-hush, top-secret 
stuff," said Curt, his eyes once 
more on the road. "The Army 
doesn't want it to leak, but they 
need Dell, need him badly. Anyone knowing bio-war developments would understand. They 
wanted to send me before. Dell's 
invitation was the break we needed. I may be the one with sufficient 
influence to bring him back. I 
hope so. But • keep it under your 
permanent and forget your guessing games. There's more to it 
than you know." 

The car passed through a cool, 
wooded section and Louise leaned 
back and drank in the beauty of it. 

"Hush-hush, top secret stuff," 
she said. "Grown men playing 
children's games." 

"Pretty deadly games for children, darling." 

IN THE late afternoon they bypassed the central part of Baltimore and headed north beyond 
the suburb of Towson toward 
Dell's truck farm. 

His sign was visible for a half 
mile: 

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT 

Eat the Best 
EAT DELL'S VEGETABLES 



"Dr. Hamon Dell, world's 
foremost biochemist — and truck 
farmer," Curt muttered as he 
swung the car off the highway. 

Louise stepped out when the 
tires ceased crunching on the 
gravel lane. She scanned the fields 
and old woods beyond the ancient but preserved farmhouse. 
"It's so unearthly." 

Curt followed. The song of 
birds, which had been so noticeable before, seemed strangely 
muted. The land itself was an 
alien, faintly greenish hue, a color 
repulsive to more than just the 
eyes. 

"It must be something in this 
particular soil," said Curt, "something that gives it that color and 
produces such wonderful crops. 
I'll have to remember to ask Dell 
about it." 

"You want Dr. Dell?" 

They whirled at the sound of 
an unfamiliar voice. Louise ut 
tered a startled cry. 

The gaunt figure behind them 
coughed asthmatically and pointed with an arm that seemed composed only of bones and brownish 
skin, so thin as to be almost translucent. 

"Yes," said Curt shakenly. 
"We're friends of his." 

"Dell's in back. I'll tell him 
you're here." 

The figure shambled away and 
Louise shook herself as if to rid 
her mind of the vision. "If our 
grandchildren ever ask about zom


A STONE AND A SPEAR 



49 



bies, I can tell them. Who in the 
world do you suppose he is?" 

"Hired man, I suppose. Sounds 
as if he should be in a lung sanatorium. Funny that Dell would 
keep him around in that condition." 

From somewhere behind the 
house came the sound of a truck 
engine. Curt took Louise's arm and 
led her around the trim, graveled 
path. 

The old farmhouse had been 
very carefully renovated. Everywhere was evidence of exqusite 
care, yet the cumulative atmosphere 
remained uninviting, almost oppressive. Curt told himself it was 
the utter silence, made even more 
tense by the lonely chugging of 
the engine in back, and the incredible harsh color of the soil 
beneath their feet. 

ROUNDING the corner, they 
came in sight of a massive 
tank truck. From it a hose led to 
an underground storage tank and 
pulsed slowly under the force of 
the liquid gushing through it. No 
one was in sight. 

"What could that be for?" 
asked Louise. 

"You've got me. Could be gasoline, but Dell hasn't any reason 
for storing that much here." 

They advanced slowly and 
amazement crept over Curt as he 
comprehended the massiveness of 
the machine. The tank was of 
elliptical cross section, over ten 



feet on its major axis. Six double 
wheels supported the rear; even 
the front ones were double. In 
spite of such wide weight distribution, the tires were pressing 
down the utterly dry ground to 
a depth of an inch or more. 

"They must haul liquid lead in 
that thing," said Curt. 

"It's getting cool. I wish Dell 
would show up." Louise glanced 
out over the twenty-acre expanse 
of truck farm. Thick rows of robust plants covered the area. Tomatoes, carrots, beets, lettuce, and 
other vegetables — a hundred or so 
fruit trees were at the far end. 
Between them ran the road over 
which the massive truck had apparently entered the farm from the 
rear. 

A heavy step sounded abruptly 
and Dell's shaggy head appeared 
from around the end of the truck. 
His face lighted with pleasure. 

"Curt, my boy! And Louise! I 
thought you weren't going to show 
up at all." 

Curt's hand was almost lost in 
Dell's enormous grip, but it 
wasn't because of that that his 
grip was passive. It was his 
shocked reaction to Dell's haggard 
appearance. The fierce eyes looked 
merely old and tired now. The 
ageless, leathery hide of Dell's 
face seemed to have collapsed before some overpowering decay, its 
bronze smoothness shattered by 
deep lines that were like tool 
marks of pain.

Curt spoke in a subdued voice. 
"It's hard to get away from Detrick. Always one more experiment 
to try — " 

" — And the brass riding you 
as if they expected you to win another war for them tomorrow afternoon," said Dell. "I remember." 

"We wondered about this 
truck," Louise commented brightly, trying to change the subject. 
"We finally gave up on it." 

"Oh, that. It brings liquid fertilizer to pump into my irrigation 
water, that's all. No mystery. Let's 
go on to the house. After you're 
settled we can catch up on everything and I'll tell you about the 
things I'm doing here." 

"Who's the man we saw?" 
asked Curt. "He looks as if his 
health is pretty precarious." 

"That's Brown. He came with 
the place — farmed it for years for 
my uncle before I inherited it. He 
could grow a garden on a granite 
slab. In spite of appearances, he's 
well enough physically." 

"How has your own health 
been ? You have — changed — since 
you were at Detrick." 

Dell raised a lock of steel-gray 
hair in his fingers and dismissed 
the question with a wan smile. 
"We all wear out sometime," he 
said. "My turn had to come." 

INSIDE, some of the oppressiveness vanished as the evening passed. It was cool enough 
for lighting the fireplace, and they 



settled before it after dinner. 
While they watched the flickering 
light that whipped the beamed 
ceiling, Dell entertained them with 
stories of his neighbors, whose 
histories he knew clear back to 
Revolutionary times. 

Early, however, Louise excused 
herself. She knew they would 
want privacy to thresh out the purposes behind Dell's invitation — 
and Curt's acceptance. 

When she was gone, there was 
a moment's silence. The logs 
crackled with shocking pistol shots 
in the fireplace. The scientist 
moved to stir the coals and then 
turned abruptly to Curt. 

"When are you going to leave 
Detrick?" 

"When are you coming back?" 
Curt demanded instead of answering. 

' "So they still want me, even 
after the things I said when I 
left." 

"You're needed badly. When I 
told Hansen I was coming down, 
he said it would be worth five 
years of my own work to bring 
you back." 

"They want me to produce even 
deadlier toxins than those I gave 
them," Dell said viciously. "They 
want some that can kill ten million people in four minutes instead of only one million — " 

"Any man would go insane if 
he looked at it that way. It would 
be the same as gun-makers being 
tormented by the vision of torn 



A STONE AND A SPEAR 



77 



men destroyed by their bullets, the 
sorrowing families — " 

"And why shouldn't the gunmakers be tormented?" Dell's 
voice was low with controlled 
hate. "They are men like you and 
me who give the tiw-makers new 
tools for their trade." 

"Oh, Dell, it's not as simple as 
that." Curt raised a hand and let 
it fall wearily. They had been over 
this so many times before. 
"Weapon designers are no more 
responsible than any other agents 
of society. It's pure neurosis to 
absorb the whole guilt of wars yet 
unfought merely because you happened to have developed a potential weapon." 

Dell touched the massive dome 
of his skull. "Here within this 
brain of mine has been conceived 
a thing which will probably destroy a billion human lives in the 
coming years. D. triconus toxin in 
a suitable aerosol requires only a 
countable number of molecules in 
the lungs of a man to kill him. 
My brain and mine alone is responsible for that vicious, murderous discovery." 

"Egotism! Any scientist's work 
is built upon the pyramid of past 
knowledge." 

f <r I lHE weapon I have described 
X exists. If I had not created 
it, it would not exist. It is as 
simple as that. No one shares my 
guilt and my responsibility. And 
what more do they want of me 



now? What greater dream of mass 
slaughter and destruction have they 
dreamed?" 

"They want you," said Curt 
quietly, "because they believe we 
are not the only ones possessing' 
the toxin. They need you to come 
back and help find the antitoxin 
for D. triconus." 

Dell shook his head. "That's a 
blind hope. The action of D. triconus is like a match set to a 
powder train. The instant its 
molecules contact protoplasm, they 
start a chain reaction that rips 
apart the cell structure. It spreads 
like fire from one cell to the next, 
and nothing can stop it once it's 
started operating within a given 
organism." 

"But doesn't this sense of guilt 
— unwarranted as it is — make you 
want to find an antitoxin?" 

"Suppose I succeeded? I would 
have canceled the weapon of an 
enemy. The military would know 
he could nullify ours in time. 
Then they would command me to 
work out still another toxin. It's 
a vicious and insane circle, which 
must be broken somewhere. The 
purpose of the entire remainder 
of my life is to break it." 

"When you are fighting for 
your life and the enemy already 
has his hands about your throat," 
Curt argued, "you reach for the 
biggest rock you can get your 
hands on and beat his brains in. 
You don't try to persuade him 
that killing is unethical."

. 



For an instant it seemed to Curt 
that a flicker of humor touched 
the corners of Dell's mouth. Then 
the lines tightened down again. 

"Exactly," he said. "You reach 
for a rock and beat his brains in. 
You don't wipe human life off 
the face of the Earth in order to 
reach that enemy. I asked you to 
come down here to help me break 
this circle of which I spoke. There 
has to be someone here — after I'm 
gone — " 

Dell's eyes shifted to the depths 
of shadows beyond the firelight 
and remained fixed on unseen 
images. 

"Me? Help you?" Curt asked 
incredulously. "What could I do? 
Give up science and become a 
truck gardener, too?" 

"You might say that we would 
be in the rock business," replied 
Dell. "Fighting is no longer on 
the level of one man with his 
hands ^-about another's throat, but 
it should be. Those who want 
power and domination should 
have to fight for it personally. But 
it has been a long time since they 
had to. 

<<T7WEN in the old days, kings 
J— J and emperors, hired mercenaries to fight their wars. The 
militarists don't buy swords now. 
They buy brains. We're the mercenaries of the new day, Cart, you 
and I. Once there was honor in 
our profession. We searched for 
truth for its own sake, and be


cause it was our way of life. Once 
we were the hope of the world 
because science was a universal 
language. 

"What a horrible joke that 
turned out to be! Today we are 
the terror of the world. The warmakers built us fine laboratories, 
shining palaces, and granted every 
whim — for a price. They took us 
up to the hills and showed us the 
whole world and we sold our souls 
for it. 

"Look what happened after the 
last war. Invading armies carried 
off prize Nazi brains like so much 
loot, set the scientists up in big 
new laboratories, and these new 
mercenaries keep right on pouring out knowledge for other kings 
and emperors. 

"Their loyalty is only to their 
science. But they can't experiment 
for knowledge any more, only 
weapons and counter-weapons. 
You'll say I'm anti-war, even, perhaps, anti-American or pro-Russian. I am not against just wars, 
but I am against unjust slaughter. 
And I love America too much to 
let her destroy herself along with 
the enemy." 

"Then what are we to do?" Curt 
demanded fiercely. "What are we 
to do while enemy scientists prepare these same weapons to exterminate us? Sure, it's one hell 
of a mess. Science is already dead. 
The kind you talk about has been 
dead for twenty years. All our fine 
ideals are worthless until the poli

73 



ticians find a solution to their 
quarrels." 

"Politicians? Since when did 
men of science have to wait upon 
politicians for solutions of human 
problems?" Dell passed a hand 
over his brow, and suddenly his 
face contorted in pain. 

"What is it?" Curt exclaimed, 
rising. 

"Nothing — nothing, my boy. 
Some minor trouble I've had lately- It will pass in a moment." 

With effort, he went on. "I 
wanted to say that already you 
have come to think of science being divided into armed camps by 
the artificial boundaries of the 
politicians. Has it been so long 
ago that it was not even in your 
lifetime, when scientists regarded 
themselves as one international 
brotherhood?" 

"I can't quarrel with your 
ideals," said Curt softly. "But national boundary lines do, actually, 
divide the scientists of the world 
into armed camps." 

< <"\7'OUR premises are still inJL correct. They do not deliberately war on each other. It is 
only that they have blindly sold 
themselves as mercenaries. And 
they can be called upon to redeem 
themselves. They can break their 
unholy contracts." 

"There would have to be simultaneous agreement among the 
scientists of all nations. And they 
are men, influenced by national 



ideals. They are not merely 
ivory-tower dabblers and searchers 
after truth." 

"Do you remember me five 
years ago?" Dell's face became 
more haggard, as if the memory 
shamed him. "Do you remember 
when I told the atomic scientists 
to examine their guts instead of 
their consciences?" 

"Yes. You certainly have 
changed." 

"And so can other men. There 
is a way. I need your help desperately, Curt — " 

The face of the aging biochemist contorted again with unbearable pain. His forehead beaded 
with sweat as he clenched his 
skull between his vein-knotted 
hands. 

"Dell! What is it?" 

"It will pass," Dr. Dell breathed 
through clenched teeth. "I have 
some medicine— in my bedroom. 
I'm afraid I'll have to excuse myself tonight. There's so much more 
I have to say to you, but we'll 
continue our talk in the morning, 
Curt. I'm sorry — " 

He stumbled out, refusing 
Curt's offer of aid with a grim 
headshake. The fire crackled loudly within the otherwise silent 
room. Curt felt cold at the descending chill of the night, his 
mind bewildered at Dell's barrage, 
some of it so reasonable, some of 
it so utterly confused. And there 
was no clue to the identity of the 
powerful force that had made so 



74 




 



great a change in the once militant 
scientist. 

Slowly Curt mounted the staircase of the old house and went 
to the room Dell had assigned 
them. Louise was in bed reading 
a murder mystery. 

"Secret mission completed?" she 
asked. 

Curt sat down on the edge of 
the bed. "I'm afraid something 
terrible is wrong with Dell. Besides the neurotic guilt complex 
because of his war work, he 
showed signs of a terrific and apparently habitual pain in his head. 
If that should be brain tumor, it 
might explain his erratic notions, 
his abandonment of his career." 

"Oh, I hope it's not that!" 

IT SEEMED to Curt that he had 
slept only minutes before he 
was roused by sounds in the night. 
He rolled over and switched on 
the light. His watch said two 
o'clock. Louise raised up in sharp 
alarm. 

"What is it?" she whispered. 

"I thought I heard something. 
There it is again !" 

"It sounds like someone in 
pain. It must be Dell!" 

Curt leaped from the bed and 
wrestled into his bathrobe. As he 
hurried toward Dell's room, there 
was another deep groan that ended in a shuddering sob of unbearable agony. 

He burst into the scientist's 
room and switched on the light. 



Dell looked up, eyes glazed with 
pain. 

"Dr. Dell!" 

"Curt — I thought I had time 
left, but this is as far as I can go — 
Just remember all I said tonight. 
Don't forget a word of it." He sat 
up rigidly, hardly breathing in the 
effort of control. "The responsibility for the coming destruction 
of civilization lies at the doors of 
the scientist • mercenaries. Don't 
allow it, Curt. Get them to abandon the laboratories of the warriors. Get them to reclaim their 
honor — " 

He fell back upon the pillow, 
his face white with pain and shining with sweat. "Brown — see 
Brown. He can tell you the — the 
rest." 

"I'll go for a doctor," said Curt. 
"Who have you had? Louise will 
stay with you." 

"Don't bring a doctor. There's 
no escaping this. I've known it 
for months. Wait here with me, 
Curt. I'll be gone soon." 

Curt stared with pity at the great 
scientist whose mind had so disintegrated. "You need a doctor. 
I'll call a hospital, Johns Hopkins, 
if you want." 

"Wait, maybe you're right. I 
have no phone here. Get Dr. Wilson — the Judge Building, Towson 
— find his home address in a phone 
book." 

"Fine. I'll only be a little 
while." 

He stepped to the door. 



A STONE AND A SPEAR

"Curt! Take the lane down to 
the new road — behind the farm. 
Quicker — it cuts off a mile or so 
— go down through the orchard — " 

"All right. Take it easy now. 
I'll be right back." 

Curt frantically got dressed, ran 
down the stairs and out to the 
car. He wondered absently what 
had become of the cadaverous 
Brown, who seemed to have vanished from the premises. 

THE wheels spun gravel as he 
started the car and whipped 
it out of the driveway. Then he 
was on the stretch of lane leading 
through the grove. The moonless 
night was utterly dark, and the 
stream of light ahead of the car 
seemed the only living thing upon 
the whole landscape. He almost 
wished he had taken the more 
familiar road. To get lost now 
might mean death for Dell. 

No traffic flowed past him in 
either direction. There were no 
buildings showing lights. Overwhelming desolation seemed to 
possess the countryside and seep 
into his soul. It seemed impossible 
that this lay close to the other 
highway with which he was 
familiar. 

He strained his eyes into the 
darkness for signs of an all-night 
gas station or store from which 
he could phone. Finally, he resigned himself to going all the 
way to Towson. At that moment 



lie glimpsed a spark of light far 
ahead. 

Encouraged, Curt stepped on 
the gas. In less than ten minutes 
he was at the spot. He braked 
the car to a stop, and surveyed the 
building as he got out. It seemed 
more like a power substation than 
anything else. But there should 
be a telephone, at least. 

He knocked on the door. Almost instantly, footsteps sounded 
within. 

The door swung wide. 

"I wonder if I could use 
your — " Curt began. He gasped. 
"Brown ! Dell's dying — we've got 
to get a doctor for him — " 

As if unable to comprehend, 
the hired man stared dumbly for 
a long moment. His hollowcheeked face was almost skeletal 
in the light that flooded out from 
behind him. 

Then from somewhere within 
the building came a voice, sharp 
with tension. "Brown! What the 
devil are you doing? Shut that 
door!" 

That brought the figure to life. 
He whipped out a gun and motioned Curt inward. "Step inside. 
We'll have to decide what to do 
with you when Carlson finds 
you're here." 

"What's the matter with you?" 
Curt asked, stupefied. "Dell's dying. He needs help." 

"Get in here!" 

Curt moved slowly forward. 
Brown closed the door behind him 



76 




 



and motioned toward a closed 
door at the other end of a short 
hall. They opened it and stepped 
into a dimly lighted room. 

Curt's eyes slowly adjusted and 
he saw what seemed to be a laboratory. It was so packed with 
equipment that there was scarcely 
room for the group of twelve or 
fifteen men jammed closely about 
some object with their backs to 
Curt and Brown. 

Brown shambled forward like 
an agitated skeleton, breaking the 
circle. Then Curt saw that the object of the men's attention was a 
large cathode ray screen occupied 
by a single green line. There was 
a pip on it rising sharply near one 
side of the two-foot tube. The pip 
moved almost imperceptibly toward a vertical red marker over 
the face of the screen. The men 
stared as if hypnotized by it. 

THE newcomers' arrival, however, disturbed their attention. One man turned with an 
irritable growl. "Brown, for 
heaven's sake — " 

He was a bony creature, even 
more cadaverous than Brown. He 
caught sight of Curt's almost indecently robust face. He gasped 
and swore. 

"Who is this? What's he doing here?" 

The entire montage of skull 
faces turned upon Curt. He heard 
a sharp collective intake of breath, 
as if his presence were some un


foreseen calamity that had shaken 
the course of their incomprehensible lives. 

"This is Curtis Johnson," said 
Brown. "He got lost looking for 
a doctor for Dell." 

A mummylike figure rose from 
a seat before the instrument. 
"Your coming is tremendously unfortunate, but for the moment we 
can do nothing about it. Sit here 
beside me. My name is Tarron 
Sark." 

The man indicated a chair. 

"My friend, Dr. Dell, is dying," Curt snapped out, refusing 
to sit down. "I've got to get help. 
I saw your light and hoped you'd 
allow me to use your phone. I 
don't know who you are nor what 
Dell's hired man is doing here 
with you. But you've got to let 
me go for help!" 

"No." The man, Sark, shook 
his head. "Dell is reconciled. He 
has to go. We are awaiting precisely the event you would halt — 
his death." 

He had known it, Curt thought, 
from the moment he entered that 
room. Like vultures sitting on 
cliffs waiting for the death of their 
prey, these fantastic men let their 
glance slip back to the screen. The 
green line was a third of the way 
toward the red marker now, and 
moving more rapidly. 

It was nightmare — meaningless — 

'Tm not staying," Curt insisted. 
"You can't prevent me from help

77 



ing Dell without assuming responsibility for his death. J demand 
you let me call." 

"You're not going to call," said 
Sark wearily. "And we assumed 
responsibility for Dell's death long 
ago. Sit down!" 

Slowly Curt sank down upon 
the chair beside the stranger. 
There was nothing else to do. He 
was powerless against Brown's 
gun. But he'd bring them to justice somehow, he swore. 

He didn't understand the meaning of the slowly moving pattern 
on the 'scope face, yet, as his eyes 
followed that pip, he sensed tension in the watching men that 
seemed sinister, almost murderous. 
How? 

What did the inexorably advancing pip signify? 

NO ONE spoke. The room was 
stifling hot and the breathing 
of the circle of men was a dull, 
rattling sound in Curt's ears. 

Quickly then, gathering sudden 
momentum, the pip accelerated. 
The circle of men grew taut. 

The pip crossed the red line — 
and vanished. 

Only the smooth green trace remained, motionless and without 
meaning. 

With hesitant shuffling of feet, 
the circle expanded. The men 
glanced uncertainly at one another. 

One said, "Well, that's the end 
of Dell. We'll soon know now 



if we're on the right track, or if 
we've botched it. Carlson will call 
■when he's computed it." 

"The end of Dell?" Curt repeated slowly, as if trying to convince himself of what he knew 
had happened. "The pip on the 
screen — that showed his life leaving him?" 

"Yes," said Sark. "He knew he 
had to go. And there are perhaps 
hundreds more like him. But Dell 
couldn't have told you of that — " 

"What will we do with him?" 
Brown asked abruptly. 

"If Dell is dead, you murdered 
him!" Curt shouted. 

A rising personal fear grew 
within him. They could not release him now, even though his 
story would make no sense to anybody. But they had somehow killed 
Dell, or thought they had, and they 
wouldn't hesitate to kill Curt. He 
thought of Louise in the great 
house with the corpse of Haman 
Dell — if, of course, he was actually dead. But that was nonsense. . . . 

"Dell must have sent you to 
us!" Sark said, as if a great mystery had suddenly been lifted from 
his mind. "He did not have time 
to tell you everything. Did he tell 
you to take the road behind the 
farm?" 

Curt nodded bitterly. "He told 
me it was the quickest way to get 
to a doctor." 

"He did? Then he knew even 
better than we did how rapidly he 



78 




 



was slipping. Yes, this was the 
quickest way." 

"What are you talking about?" 
Curt demanded. 

"Did Dell say anything at all 
about what he wanted of you?" 

"It was all wild. Something 
about helping with some crazy 
plans to retreat from the scientific 
world. He was going to finish talking in the morning, but I guess it 
wouldn't have mattered. I realize 
now that he was sick and irrational." 

"Too sick to explain everything, 
but not irrational," S.irk said 
thoughtfully. "He left it to us to 
tell you, since you are to succeed 
him." 

"Succeed Dell? In what?" 

SARK suddenly flipped a switch 
on a panel at his right. A 
screen lighted with some fuzzy 
image. It cleared with a slight dial 
adjustment, and Curt seemed to 
be looking at some oddly familiar 
moonlit ruin. 

"An American city," said Sark, 
hurrying his words now. "Any 
city. They are all alike. Ruin. 
Death. This one died thirty years 
ago." 

"I don't understand," Curt complained, bewildered. "Thirty 
years — " 

"At another point in the Time 
Continuum," said Sark. "The future. Your future, you understand. 
Or, rather, our present, the one 
you created for us." 



Curt recoiled at the sudden 
venom in Sark's voice. "The future?" That was what they had 
in common with Dell — psychosis, 
systematic delusions. He had suspected danger before; now it was 
imminent and terrifying. 

"Perhaps you are one of those 
who regard your accomplishments 
with pride," Sark went on savagely, ignoring or unaware of Curt's 
fear and horror. "That the hydrogen bombs smashed the cities, and 
the aerosols destroyed the remnants of humanity seems insignificant to you beside the high 
technical achievement these things 
represent." 

Curt's throat was dry with panic. 
Irrelevantly, he recalled the painfired eyes of Dell and the dying 
scientist's words: "The responsibility for the coming destruction 
of civilization lies at the doors of 
the scientist mercenaries — " 

"Some of us did manage to survive," said Sark, glaring at the 
scene of gaunt rubble. Curt could 
see the veins pounding beneath 
the thin flesh of his forehead. "We 
lived for twenty years with the 
dream of rebuilding a world, the 
same dream that has followed all 
wars. But at last we knew that the 
dream was truly vain this time. 
We survivors lived in heremetically 
sealed caverns, trying to exist and 
recover our lost science and technology. 

"We could not emerge into the 
Earth's atmosphere. Its pollution 



A STONE AND A SPEAR 



79 



with virulent aerosols would persist for another hundred years. We 
could not bear a new race out of 
these famished and rickety bodies 
of ours. Unless Man was to vanish completely from the face of 
the Earth, we had only a single 
hope. That hope was to prevent 
the destruction from ever occurring!" 

Sark's eyes were burning now. 
"Do you understand what that 
means? We had to go back, not 
forward. We had to arm to fight 
a new war, a war to prevent the 
final war that destroyed Mankind." 

"Back? How could you go 
back?" Curt hesitated, grasping 
now the full insanity of the scene 
about him. "How have you come 
back?" He waited tautly for the 
answer. It would be gibberish, of 
course, like all the mad conversation before it. 

<<nnHE undisturbed flow of time 
X from the beginning to the 
end — neither of which we can experience — we call, the Prime Continuum," Sark replied. "Mathematically speaking, it is composed 
of billions of separate bands of 
probability running side by side. 
For analogy, you may liken it to a 
great river, whose many insignificant tributaries merge into a roaring, turbulent whole. That is 
the flow of time, the Prime Continuum. 

"You may change one of these 
tributaries, dam it up, turn it aside, 



let it reach the main stream at a 
different point. No matter how 
insignificant the tributary, the 
stream will not be the same after 
the change. That is what we are 
doing. We are controlling critical 
tributaries of the Prime Continuum, altering the hell that you 
scientists have so generously handed down to us. 

"Dell was a critical tributary. 
You, Dr. Curtis Johnson, are another. Changing or destroying such 
key individuals snips off branches 
of knowledge before they come 
into fruit." 

It was an ungraspable answer, 
but it had to be argued against 
because of its conclusion. "The 
scientists are not bringing about the 
war," Curt said, looking from one 
fleshless face to another. "Find the 
politicians responsible, those willing to turn loose any horror to 
gain power. They are the ones you 
want." 

"That would mean destroying 
half the human race. In your day, 
nearly every man is literally a politician." 

"Talk sense!" Curt said angrily. 

"A politician, as we have come 
to define him, is simply one willing to sacrifice the common good 
for his own ends. It is a highly 
infectious disease in a day when 
altruism is taken for cowardice or 
mere stupidity. No, we have not 
mistaken our goal, Dr. Johnson. 
We cannot hasten the maturity of 
the race. We can only hope to take 



SO 




 



the matches away so the children 
cannot burn the house down. 
Whatever you doubt, do not doubt 
that we are from the future or 
that we caused Dell's death. He is 
only one of many." 

Curt slumped. "I did doubt it. 
I still do, yet not with conviction. 
Why?" 

"Because your own sense of 
guilt tells you that you and Dell 
and others like you are literally 
the matches which we have to remove. Because your knowledge of 
science has overcome your desire 
not to believe. Because you know 
the shape of the future." 

"The war after the Third World 
War — " Curt murmured. "Someone said it would be fought with 
stones and spears, but your weapons are far from stones and 
spears." 

"Perhaps not so far at that," 
said Sark, his face twisting wryly. 
He reached to a nearby table and 
picked up a tomato and a carrot. 
"These are our weapons. As humble and primitive as the stones and 
spears of cavemen." 

"A7"OU'RE joking," Curt re
JL plied, almost ready to grin. 

"No. This is the ultimate 
development of biological warfare. Man is what he eats — " 

"That's what Dell's sign said." 

"We operate hundreds of gardens and farms such as Dell's. We 
work through the fertilizing compounds we supply to these farms. 



These compounds contain chem. 
icals that eventually lodge in the 
cells of those who eat the produce. They take up stations within 
the brain cells and change the man 
— or destroy him. 

"Certain cells of the brain are responsible for specific characteristics. 
Ways of altering these cells were 
found by introducing minute quantities of specific radioactive materials which could be incorporated into 
vegetable foods. During the Third 
War wholesale insanity was produced in entire populations by 
similar methods. Here, we are 
using it to accomplish humane 
purposes. 

"We are simply restraining the 
scientists responsible for the destroying weapons that produced 
our nightmare world. You saw 
the change that took place in Dell. 
There is a good example of what 
we do." 

"But he did change," Curt 
pointed out. "He was carrying out 
your work. Wasn't that enough 
for you? Why did you decide he 
had to die?" 

"Ordinarily, we don't want to 
kill if the change is produced. 
Sometimes the brain cells are refractory and the characteristics too 
ingrained. The cells develop tumorous activity as a result of the 
treatment. So it was with Dell. In 
his case, however, we would have 
been forced to kill him by other 
means if he had not died as he 
did. This, too, he understood very 



A STONE AND A SPEAR 



81 



well. That was why he really 
wanted no doctor to help him." 

"You must have driven him insane first!" 

"Look at this and see if you 
still think so." Sark led the way 
to a small instrument and pointed 
to the eyepiece of it. "Look in 
there." 

Curt bent over. Light sprang up 
at Sark's touch of a switch. Then 
a scene began to move before 
Curt's eyes. 

"Dell!" he exclaimed. 

The scene was of some vast and 
well-equipped biological laboratory, much like those of Camp Detrick. Silent, mask-faced technicians 
moved with precision about their 
tasks. Dr. Dell was directing operations. 

But there was something wrong. 
The figure was not the Dell that 
Curt knew. 

As if Sark sensed Curt's comprehension of this, the scene advanced and swelled until the 
whole area of vision was filled 
with Dell's face. Curt gasped. The 
face was blank and hideous. The 
eyes stared. When the scene retreated once more, Curt saw now 
that Dell moved as an automaton, 
almost without volition of his own. 

AS HE moved away from the 
bench like a sleepwalker, 
there came briefly into view the 
figure of an armed guard at ' the 
door. The figure of a corporal, 
grim in battle dress. 



Curt looked up, sick as if some 
inner sense had divined the meaning of that scene which he could 
not yet put into words. 

"Had enough?" asked Sark. 

"What does it mean?" 

"That is Dell as he would have 
been. That is what he was willing 
to die to avoid." 

"But what is it?" 

"A military research laboratory 
twelve years into your future. You 
are aware that in your own time 
a good deal of research has come 
to a standstill because many firststring scientists have revolted 
against military domination. Unfortunately, there are plenty of 
second-stringers available and they 
are enough for most tasks — the 
youngsters with new Ph. D.s who 
are awed by the glitter of golden 
laboratories. But, lacking experience 
or imagination, they can't . see 
through the glitter or have the insight for great work. Some will 
eventually, too late, however, and 
they will be replaced by eager new 
youngsters." 

"This scene of Dell — " 

"Just twelve years from what 
you call now. Deadlier weapons 
will be needed and so a bill will 
be passed to draft the reluctant 
first-line men — against their will, 
if necessary." 

"You can't force creative 
work," Curt objected. 

Sark shrugged. "There are 
drugs that do wonderful and 
terrible things to men's minds. 



82 




 



They can force creation or mindless destruction, confession or outrageous subterfuge. You saw your 
opponents make some use of them. 
A cardinal, for example, and an 
engineer, among others. Now you 
have seen your friend, Dell, as 
he would have been. Not the same 
drugs, of course, but the end result is the same." 

Curt's horror turned to stubborn disbelief. "America wouldn't use such methods," he said 
flatly. 

"Today? No," agreed Sark. 
"But when a country is committed 
to inhuman warfare — even though 
the goal may be honorable — 
where is the line to stop at? Each 
brutality prepares the way for the 
next. Even concentration camps 
and extermination centers become 
logical necessities. You have heard 
your opponents say that the end 
justifies the means. You have seen 
for yourself — the means become 
the end." 

"But Dell could have escaped," 
Curt protested. "You could have 
helped him to your own time or 
another. He was still valuable. He 
needn't have died!" 

"There is no such thing as actual travel in time," explained 
Sark. "Or at least in our day we 
have found none. There is possible 
only a bending back of a branch 
of the Prime Continuum so that 
we can witness, warn, instruct, 
gain aid in saving the future. And 
there can be meeting only in this 



narrow sector of unreality where 
the branch joins the main stream. 
Our farms adjoin such sectors, but 
farther than that we cannot go, nor 
can one of you become a citizen 
of the world you have created for 
us. 

"But I wish it were so!" Sark 
bit out venomously. "We'd kidnap you by the millions, force you 
to look upon the ruin and the 
horror, let you breathe the atmosphere that no man can inhale and 
live, the only atmosphere there is 
in that world. Yes, I wish you 
could become our guests there. 
Our problem would be easier. But 
it can't be done. This is the only 
way we can work. 

"Dell had to go. There was no 
escape for him, no safety for us 
if he lived. He would have been 
tracked down, captured like a 
beast and set to work against his 
will. It was there in the Prime 
Continuum. Nothing could cancel 
it except death, the death that 
saves a billion lives because he will 
not produce a toxin deadlier than 
D. triconus." 

THE vengeance in Sark's voice 
was almost tangible. Involuntarily Curt retreated a step before 
it. And — almost — he thought he 
understood these men out of time. 

"What is there — " he began 
hoarsely and had to stop. "What 
j^. there that I can do?" 

"We need you to take over 
Dell's farm. It is of key impor


A STONE AND A SPEAR

tance. The list of men he was 
treating was an extremely vital one. 
That work cannot be interrupted 
now." 

"How can you accomplish anything by operating only here?" 
Curt objected. "While you stifle 
our defenses, our enemies are 
arming to the teeth. When you've 
made us sufficiently helpless, 
they'll strike." 

"Did I say we were so restricted?" answered Sark, smiling for 
the first time. "You cannot imagine 
what a fresh vegetable means on 
a professor's table in Moscow. In 
Atomgrad a ripe tomato is worth 
a pound of uranium. How do I 
know? Because I walked the 
streets of Atomgrad with my 
grandfather." 

"Then you're a — " 

Sark's face grew hard and bitter 
in the half light of the room. 
"Was," he corrected. "Or might 
have been. There are no nationalities where there are no nations, 
no political parties where there are 
only hunger and death. The crime 
of the future is not any person's 
or country's. It is the whole of 
humanity's." 

An alarm sounded abruptly. 

"Carlson!" someone tensely exclaimed. 

Sark whirled to the panels and 
adjusted the controls. A small 
screen lighted, showing the image 
of a man with graying hair aM 
imperious face. His sharp eyes 
seemed to burn directly into Curt's. 



"How did it go?" exclaimed 
Sark. "Was the Prime Continuum 
shift as expected?" 

"No! It still doesn't compute 
out. Nothing's right. The war is 
still going on. The Continuum is 
absolute hell." 

"I should have lcnown," said 
Sark in dismay. "I should have 
called you." 

"What is it? Do you know 
what's wrong?" 

"Johnson. Dr. Curtis Johnson. 
He's here." 

RAGE spread upon Carlson's 
face. An oath exploded from 
his lips. "No wonder the situation 
doesn't compute with him out of 
the Prime Continuum. Why did 
he come there?" 

• "Dell sent him. Dell died too 
quickly. He didn't have time to 
instruct Johnson. I have told him 
what we want of him." 

"Do you understand?" Carlson 
demanded of Curt with abruptness 
that was almost anger. 

Curt looked slowly about the 
room and back to the face of his 
questioner. Understand? If they 
sent him back, allowed him to go 
back, could he ever be sure that 
he had not witnessed a thing of 
nightmare in this shadowy dream 
world ? 

Yes, he could be sure. He had 
seen the blasted city, just the way 
he knew it could be — would be 
unless someone prevented it. He 
had seen the pattern on the scope, 



84 




 



attuned to the tiny tributary of the 
Prime Continuum that was the life 
of Dr. Dell, had seen it run out, 
dying as Dell had died. 

He could believe, too, that there 
was a little farm near Atomgrad, 
where a tomato on a scientist's 
table was more potent than the 
bombs building in the arsenal. 

"I understand," he said. "Shall 
I go back now?" 

Sark put a paper into his hands. 
"Here is a list of new names. You 
will find Dell's procedures and 
records in his desk at the farm. Do 
not underestimate the importance 
of your work. You have seen the 
failure of the Prime Continuum 
to compute properly with you out 
of it. You will correct that. 

"Your only contact from now 
on will be through Brown, who 
will bring the tank truck once a 
year. You know what to do. You 
are on your own." 

It was like a surrealist painting 
as he left. The moon had risen, 
and in all the barrenness there 
was nothing but the gray cement 
cube of the building. The light 
spilling through the open doorway touched the half dozen gaunt 
men who had followed him out to 
the car. Ahead was the narrow 
band of roadway leading through 
some infinite nothingness that 
would end in Dell's truck farm. 

HE STARTED off. When he 
looked back a moment later, 
the building was no longer there. 



He glanced at the list of names 
Sark gave him, chilled by the importance of those men. For some 
there would be death as there had 
been for Dell. For himself — 

He had forgotten to ask. But 
perhaps they would not have told 
him. Not at this time, anyway. 
The chemically treated food produced tumors in refractory, unresponsive cells. He had eaten Dell's 
vegetables, would eat more. 

It was too late to ask and it 
didn't matter. He had important 
things to do. First would be the 
writing of his resignation to the 
officials of Camp Detrick. 

As of tomorrow, he would be 
Dr. Curtis Johnson, truck farmer, 
specialist in atomic-age produce, 
luscious table gifts for the innocent and not-so-innocent human 
matches that would, if he and his 
unknown colleagues succeeded, be 
prevented from cremating the 
hopes of Mankind. 

Louise would help him hang the 
new sign: 

YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT 
Eat the Best 
EAT JOHNSON'S 
VEGETABLES 

Only, of course, she wouldn't 
know why he had taken Dell's job, 
nor could he ever explain. 

It would probably be the death 
of Curt Johnson, but that was 
cheap enough if humanity survived.
