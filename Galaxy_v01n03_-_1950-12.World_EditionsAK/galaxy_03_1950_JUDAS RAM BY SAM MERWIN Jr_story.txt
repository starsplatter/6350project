JUDAS RAM BY SAM MERWIN. Jr. 

ROGER TENNANT, crossing the lawn, could see 
two of the three wings of 
the house, which radiated spokelike from its heptagonal central 
portion. The wing on the left was 
white, with slim square pillars, 
reminiscent of scores of movie sets 
of the Deep South. That on the 
right was sundeck solar-house 
living-machine modern, something 
like a montage of shoeboxes. The 
wing hidden by the rest of the 
house was, he knew, spired, gabled 
and multicolored, like an ancient 



building in pre-Hitler Cracow. 

Dana was lying under a tree 
near the door, stretched out on a 
sort of deck chair with her eyes 
. closed. She wore a golden gown, 
long and close-fitting and slit up 
the leg like the gown of a Chinese 
woman. Above it her comely face 
was sullen beneath its sleek cocoon 
of auburn hair. 

She opened her eyes at his approach and regarded him with 
nothing like favor. Involuntarily 
he glanced down at the tartan 
shorts that were his only garment 
to make sure that they were on 
properly. They were. He had 
thought them up in a moment of

utter boredom and they were extremely comfortable. However, the 
near-Buchanan tartan did not 
crease or even wrinkle when he 
moved. Their captors had no idea 
of how a woven design should behave. 

"Waiting for me?" Tennant 
asked the girl. 

•She said, "I'd rather be dead. 
Maybe I am! Maybe we're all dead 
and this is Hell." 

He stood over her and looked 
down until she turned away her 
reddening face. He said, "So it's 
,s;oing to be you again, Dana. 
You'll be the first to come back 
for a second run." 

"Don't flatter yourself," she replied angrily. She sat up, pushed 
back her hair, got to her feet a 
trifle awkwardly because of the 
tight-fitting tubular gown. "If I 
could do anything about it . . ." 

"But you can't," he told her. 
"They're too clever." 

"Is this crop rotation or did 
you send for me?" she asked cynically. "If you did, I wish you 
hadn't. You haven't asked about 
your son." 

"I don't even want to think 
about him," said Tennant. "Let's 
get on with it." He could sense the 
restless stirring of the woman 
within Dana, just as he could feel 
the stirring toward her within 
himself — desire that both of them 
loathed because it was implanted 
within them by their captors, i 

They walked toward the house. 



IT DIDN'T look like a prison — 
or a cage. Within the dome of 
the barrier, it looked more like a 
well-kept if bizarre little country 
estate. There was clipped lawn, a 
scattering of trees, even a clear 
little brook that chattered unending annoyance at the small stones 
which impeded its flow. 

But the lawn was not of grass — 
it was of a bright green substance 
that might have been cellophane 
but wasn't, and it sprouted from a 
fabric that might have been canvas 
but was something else. The trees 
looked like trees, only their trunks 
were bark all the way through — 
except that it was not bark. The 
brook was practically water, but 
the small stones over which it 
flowed were of no earthly mineral. 

They entered the house, which 
had no roof, continued to move 
beneath a sky that glowed with 
light which did not come from a 
sun or moon. It might have been 
a well-kept if bizarre little country 
estate, but it wasn't. It was a 
prison, a cage. 

The other two women were sitting in the heptagonal central hall. 
Eudalia, who had borne twin girls 
recently, was lying back, newly 
thin and dark of skin and hair, 
smoking a scentless cigaret. A tall 
woman, thirtyish, she wore a sort 
of shimmering green strapless evening gown. Tennant wondered 
how she maintained it in place, for 
despite her recent double motherhood, she was almost flat of 



34 




 



bosom. He asked her how she was 
feeling. 

"Okay, 1 guess," she said. "The 
way they manage it, there's nothing to it." She had a flat, potentially raucous voice. Eudalia had 
been a female foreman in a garment-cutting shop before being 
captured and brought through. 

"Good," he said. "Glad to hear 
it." He felt oddly embarrassed. He 
turned to Olga, broad, blonde and 
curiously vital, who sat perfectly 
still, regarding him over the pregnant swell of her dirndl-clad waist. 
Olga had been a waitress in a 
mining town hash-house near 
Scranton. 

Tennant wanted to put an encouraging hand on her shoulder, 
to say something that might cheer 
her up, for she was by far the 
youngest of the three female captives, barely nineteen. But with 
the eyes of the other two, especially Dana, upon him, he could 
not. 

"I guess I wasn't cut out to be 
a Turk," he said. "I don't feel at 
ease in a harem, even when it's 
supposedly my own." 

"You're not doing so badly," 
Dana replied acidly. 

"Lay off — he can't help it," said 
Eudalia unexpectedly. "He doesn't 
like it any better than we do." 
i "But he doesn't have to — have 
them," objected Olga. She had a 
trace of 'Polish accent that was not 
unpleasant. In fact, Tennant 
thought, only her laughter was 



unpleasant, a shrill, uncontrolled 
burst of staccato sound that jarred 
him to his heels. Olga had not 
laughed of late, however. She was 
too frightened. 

<<T ET'S get the meal ordered," 
-I— J said Dana and they were all 
silent, thinking of what they 
wanted to eat but would not enjoy 
when it came. Tennant finished 
with his order, then got busy with 
his surprise. 

It arrived before the meal, 
materializing against one of the 
seven walls of the roofless chamber. It was a large cabinet on 
slender straight legs that resembled dark polished wood. Tennant 
went to it, opened a hingeless door 
and pushed a knob on the inner 
surface. At once the air was hideous with the acerate harmony of a 
singing commercial. . . . 

... so go soak your head, 
be it gold, brown or red, 
in Any-tone Shampoo! 

A disc jockey's buoyant tones 
cut in quickly as the final ooooo 
faded. "This is Grady Martin, 
your old night-owl, coming to you 
with your requests over Station 
WZZX, Manhattan. Here's a wire 
from Theresa McManus and the 
girls in the family entrance of 
Conaghan's Bar and Grill on 
West : . ." 

Tennant watched the girls as a 
sweet-voiced crooner began to ply

an unfamiliar love lyric to a melody whose similarity to a thousand 
predecessors doomed it to instant 
success. 

Olga sat up straight, her- pale 
blue eyes round with utter disbelief. She looked at the radio, at 
Tennant, at' the other two women, 
then back at the machine. She 
murmured something in Polish 
that was inaudible, but her expression showed that it must have been 
wistful. 

Eudalia grinned at Tennant and, 
rising, did a sort of tap dance to 
the music, then whirled back into 
her chair, green dress ashimmer, 
and sank into it just to listen. 

Dana stood almost in the center 
of the room, carmine-tipped fingers clasped beneath the swell of 
her breasts. She might have been 
listening to Brahms or Debussy. 
Her eyes glowed with the salty 
brilliance of emotion and she was 
almost beautiful. 

"Rog!" she cried softly when 
the music stopped. "A radio and 
WZZX! Is it— are they— real?" 

"As real as you or I," he told 
her. "It took quite a bit of doing, 
getting them to put a set together. 
And I wasn't sure that radio would 
get through. TV doesn't seem 
to. Somehow it brings things 
closer. . . ." 

Olga got up quite suddenly, 
went to the machine and, after 
frowning at it for a moment, tuned 
in another station from which a 
Polish-speaking announcer was 



followed by polka music. She 
leaned against the wall, resting one 
smooth forearm on the top of the 
machine. Her eyes closed and she 
swayed a little in time to the polka 
beat. 

TENNANT caught Dana looking at him and there was near 
approval in her expression — approval that faded quickly as soon 
as she caught his gaze upon her. 
The food arrived then and they 
sat down at the round table to eat 
it. 

Tennant's meat looked like 
steak, it felt like steak, but, lacking the aroma of steak, it was almost tasteless. This was so with 
all of their foods, with their cigarets, with everything in their prison 
— or their cage. Their captors were 
utterly without a human conception of smell, living, apparently, 
in a world without odor at all. 

Dana said suddenly, "I named 
the boy Tom, after somebody I 
hate almost as much as I hate you." 

Eudalia laid down her fork with 
a clatter and regarded Dana disapprovingly. "Why take it out on 
Rog?" she asked bluntly. "He 
didn't ask to come here any more 
than we did. He's got a wife back 
home. Maybe you want him to fall 
in love with you? Maybe you're 
jealous because he doesn't? Well, 
maybe he can't! And maybe it 
wouldn't work, the way things are 
arranged here." 

"Thanks, Eudalia," said Ten

nant. "I think I can defend myself. But she's right, Dana. We're 
as helpless as — laboratory animals. They have the means to 
make us do whatever they want." 

"Rog," said Dana, looking suddenly scared, "I'm sorry I snapped 
at you. I know it's not your fault. 
I'm — changing." 

He shook his head. "No, Dana, 
you're not changing. You're adapting. We all are. We seem to be in 
a universe of different properties 
as well as different dimensions. 
We're adjusting. I can do a thing 
or two myself that seem absolutely impossible." 

"Are we really in the fourth dimension?" Dana asked. Of the 
three of them, she alone had more 
than a high-school education. 

"We may be in the eleventh for 
all I know," he told her. "But I'll 
settle for the fourth — a fourth dimension in space, if that makes 
scientific sense, because we don't 
seem to have moved in time. I 
wasn't sure of that, though, till we 
got the radio." 

"Why haven't they brought more 
of us through?" Eudalia asked, 
tamping out ashes in a tray that 
might have been silver. 

"I'm not sure," he said thoughtfully. "I think it's hard for them. 
They have a hell of a time bringing anyone through alive, and lately they haven't brought anyone 
through — not alive." 

"Why do they do it — the other 
way, I mean?" asked Dana.

Tennant shrugged. "I don't 
know. I've been thinking about it. 
I suppose it's because they're 
pretty human." 

"Human!" Dana was outraged. 
"Do you call it human to — " 

"Hold on," he said. "They pass 
through their gateway to Earth at 
considerable danger and, probably, 
expense of some kind. Some of 
them don't come back. They kill 
those of us who put up a fight. 
Those who don't — or can't — they 
bring back with them. Live or 
dead, we're just laboratory specimens." 

"Maybe," Eudalia conceded 
doubtfully. Then her eyes blazed. 
"But the things they dcj — stuffing 
people, mounting their heads, keeping them on display in their — 
their whatever they live in. You 
call that human, (Rog?" 

"Were you ever in a big-game 
hunter's trophy room?" Tennant 
asked quietly. "Or in a Museum of 
Natural History? A zoo? A naturalist's lab? Or even, maybe, 
photographed as a baby on a bearskin rug?" 

"I was," said Olga. "But that's 
not the same thing." 

"Of course not," he agreed. "In 
the one instance, we're the hunters, 
the breeders, the trophy collectors. 
In the other" — he shrugged — 
'"we're the trophies." 

' npHERE was a long silence. They 
J- finished eating and then Dana 
stood up and said, "I'm going out 

l

on the lawn for a while." She unzipped her golden gown, stepped 
out of it to reveal a pair of tartan 
shorts that matched his, and. a 
narrow halter. 

"You thought those up while we 
ate," he said. It annoyed him to be 
copied, though he did not know 
why. She laughed at him silently, 
tossed her auburn hair back from 
her face and went out of the roofless house, holding the gold dress 
casually over her bare arm. 

Eudalia took him to the nursery. 
He was irritated now in another, 
angrier way. The infants, protected by cellophane-like coverlets, 
were asleep. 

"They never cry," the thin woman told him. "But they grow — 
God, how they grow!" 

"Good," said Tennant, fighting 
down his anger. He kissed her, 
held her close, although neither of 
them felt desire at the moment. 
Their captors had seen to that; it 
wasn't Eudalia's turn. Tennant said, 
"I wish I could do something about 
this. I hate seeing Dana so bitter 
and Olga so scared. It isn't their 
fault." 

"And it's not yours," insisted 
Eudalia. "Don't let them make you 
think it is." 

"I'll try not to," he said and 
stopped, realizing the family party 
was over. He had felt the inner 
tug of command, said good-by to 
the women and returned to his 
smaller compound within its own 
barrier dome.

Then tame the invisible aura of 
strain in the air, the shimmering 
illusion of heat that was not heat, 
that was prelude to his teleportation ... if that were the word. It 
was neither pleasant nor unpleasant; it was, that was all. 

He called it the training hall, 
not because it looked like a training hall but because that was its 
function. It didn't actually look 
like anything save some half-nourished dream a surrealist might 
have discarded as too nightmarish 
for belief. 

As in all of this strange universe, excepting the dome-cages in 
which the captives were held, the 
training hall followed no rules of 
three-dimensional space. One wall 
looked normal for perhaps a third 
of its length, then it simply wasn't 
for a bit. It came back farther on 
at an impossible angle. Yet, walking along it, touching it, it felt 
perfectly smooth and continuously 
straight. • 

The opposite wall resembled a 
diagonal cross-section of an 
asymmetrical dumbbell — that was 
the closest Tennant could come to 
it in words. And it, too, felt 
straight. The floor looked like 
crystal smashed by some cosmic 
impact, yet it had reason. He 
knew this even though no reason 
was apparent to his three-dimensional vision. The ceiling, where 
he. could see it, was beyond description. 

The captor Tennant called 



JUDAS RAM 



39 



Opal came in through a far corner 
of the ceiling. He — if it was a he 
— was not large, although this, 
Tennant knew, meant nothing; 
Opal might extend thousands of 
yards in some unseen direction. He 
had no regular shape and much 
of him was iridescent and shot 
with constantly changing colors. 
Hence the name Opal. 

Communication was telepathic. 
Tennant could have yodeled or 
yelled or sung Mississippi Mud 
and Opal would have shown no 
reaction. Yet Tennant suspected 
that the captors could hear somewhere along the auditory scale, just 
as perhaps they could smell, although not in any human sense. 

You will approach without use 
of your appendages. 

The command was as clear as if 
it had been spoken aloud. Tennant 
took a deep breath. He thought 
of the space beside Opal. It took 
about three seconds and he was 
there, having spanned a distance 
of some ninety feet. He was getting good at it. 

Dog does trick, he thought. 

HE WENT through the entire 
routine at Opal's bidding. 
When at last he was allowed to 
relax, he wondered, not for the 
first time, if he weren't mastering 
some of the alleged Guru arts. At 
once he felt probing investigation. 
Opal, like the rest of the captors, 
was as curious as a cat — or a human being. 



Tennant sat against a wall, 
drenched with sweat. There would 
be endless repetition before his 
workout was done. On Earth, dogs 
were said to be intellectually twodimensional creatures. He wondered if they felt this helpless futility when their masters taught 
them to heel, to point, to retrieve. 

Some days later, the training 
routine was broken. He felt a 
sudden stir of near-sick excitement 
as he received the thought: 

Now you are ready. We are going through at last. 

Opal was nervous, so much so 
that he revealed more than he intended. Or perhaps that was his 
intent; Tennant could never be 
sure. They were going through to 
Tennant's own dimension. He 
wondered briefly just what his 
role was to be. 

He had little time to speculate 
before Opal seemed to envelop 
him. There was the blurring 
wrench of forced teleportation 
and they were in another room, a 
room which ended in a huge irregular passage that might have been 
the interior of a giant concertina — 
or an old-fashioned kodak. 

He stood before a kidney-shaped 
object over whose jagged surface 
colors played constantly. From 
Opal's thoughts it appeared to be 
some sort of ultradimensional television set, but to Tennant it was 
as incomprehensible as an oil 
painting to an animal. 

Opal was annoyed that Tennant 



40 




 



could make nothing of it. Then 
came the thought: 

What cover must your body 
have not to be conspicuous? 

Tennant wondered, cynically, 
what would happen if he were to 
demand a costume of mediaeval 
motley, complete with Pied Piper's 
flute. He received quick reproof 
that made his" head ring as from a 
blow. 

He asked Opal where and when 
they were going, was informed 
that he would soon emerge on 
Earth where he had left it. That 
told him everything but, the date 
and season. Opal, like the rest of 
the captors, seemed to have no 
understanding of time in a human 
sense. 

Waiting, Tennant tried not to 
think of his wife, of the fact that 
he hadn't seen her in — was it more 
than a year and a half on Earth? 
He could have controlled his heartbeat with one of his new powers, 
but that might have made Opal 
suspicious. He should be somewhat 
excited. He allowed himself to be, 
though he obscured the reasons. 
He was going to see his wife 
again . . . and maybe he could 
trick his way into not returning. 

* * * 

fTVHE maid who opened the door 
-L for him was new, although 
her eyes were old. But she recognized him and stood aside to let 
him enter. There must, he 



thought, still be pictures of him 
around. He wondered how Agatha 
could afford a servant. 

"Is Mrs. Tennant in?" he asked. 

She shook her head and fright 
made twin stoplights of the rouge 
on her cheeks as she shut the door 
behind him. He went into the living room, directly to the long silver cigaret box on the coffee table. 
'It was proof of homecoming to fill 
his lungs with smoke he could 
smell. He took another drag, saw 
the maid still in the doorway, staring. 

"There's no need for fright," he 
told her. "I believe I still own 
this house." Then, "When do you 
expect Mrs. Tennant?" 

"She just called. She's on her 
way home from the club." 

Still looking frightened, she departed for the rear of the house. 
Tennant stared after her puzzledly until the kitchen door swung 
shut behind her. The club? What 
club? 

He shrugged, returned to the 
feeling of comfort that came from 
being back here, about to see 
Agatha again, hold her close in no 
more than a few minutes. And 
stay, his mind began to add 
eagerly, but he pushed the thought 
down where Opal could not detect 
it. 

He took another deep, lungfilling drag on his cigaret, looked 
around the room that was so important a part of his life. The three 
women back there would be in a 



JUDAS RAM 



41 



ghastly spot. He felt like a heel 
for wanting to leave them there, 
then knew that he would try somehow to get them out. Not, of 
course, anything that would endanger his remaining with Agatha; 
the only way his captors would 
get him back would be as a taxidermist's specimen. 

He realized, shocked and scared, 
that his thoughts of escape had 
slipped past his mental censor, and 
he waited apprehensively for Opal 
to strike. Nothing happened and 
he warily relaxed. Opal wasn't 
tapping his thoughts. Because he 
felt sure of his captive ... or because he couldn't on Earth? 

It was like being let out of a 
cage. Tennant grinned at the bookcase; the ebony-and-ivory elephants 
that Agatha had never liked were 
gone, but he'd get them back or 
another pair. The credenza had 
been replaced by a huge and ugly 
television console. That, he resolved, would go down in the 
cellar rumpus room, where its 
bleached modernity wouldn't clash 
with the casual antiquity of the 
living room. 

Agatha would complain, naturally, but his being back would 
make up for any amount of furniture shifting. He imagined her 
standing close to him, her lovely 
face lifted to be kissed, and his 
heart lurched like an adolescent's. 
This hunger was real, not implanted. Everything would be real 
... his love for her, the food he 



ate, the things he touched, his 
house, his life. . . . 

Your wife and a man are approaching the house. 

The thought message from Opal 
crumbled his illusion of freedom. 
He sank down in a chair, trying to 
refuse to listen to the rest of the 
command: 

You are to bring the man 
through the gateway with you. We 
want another live male. 

TENNANT shook his head, stiff 
and defiant in his chair. The 
punishment, when it came, was 
more humiliating than a slap across 
a dog's snout. Opal had been too 
interested in the next lab specimen 
to bother about his thoughts — that 
was why he had been free to think 
of escape. 

Tennant closed his eyes, willed 
himself to the front window. Now 
that he had mastered teleportation, 
it was incredible how much easier 
it was in his own world. He had 
covered the two miles from the 
gateway to the house in a mere 
seven jumps, the distance to the 
window in an instant. But there 
was no pleasure in it, only a confirmation of his captor's power over 
him. 

He ■ was not free of them. He 
understood all too well what they 
wanted him to do; he was to play 
the Judas goat ... or rather the 
Judas ram, leading another victim 
to the fourth-dimensional pen. 

Grim, he watched the swoop of 



42 




 



headlights in the driveway and returned to the coffee table, lit a 
fresh cigarette. 

The front door was flung open 
and his diaphragm tightened at the 
remembered sound of Agatha's 
throaty laugh . . . and tightened 
further when it was followed by a 
deeper rumbling laugh. Sudden 
fear made the cigarette shake in his 
fingers. 

"... Don't be such a stuffedshirt, darling." Agatha's mocking 
sweetness rang alarm-gongs in Tennant's memory. "Charley wasn't 
making a grab for me. He'd had 
one too many and only wanted a 
little fun. Really, darling, you seem 
to think that a girl . . ." 

Her voice faded out as she saw 
Tennant standing there. She was 
wearing a white strapless gown, 
had a blue-red-and-gold Mandarin 
jacket slung hussar-fashion over her 
left shoulder. She looked even 
sleeker, better groomed, more assured than his memory of her. 

"I'm no stuffed-shirt and you 
know it." Cass' tone was peevish. 
"But your idea of fun, Agatha, is 
pretty damn . . ." 

It was his turn to freeze. Unbelieving, Tennant studied his successor. Cass Gordon — the man, the 
ex-halfback whose bulk was beginning to get out of hand, but 
whose inherent aggressive grace 
had not yet deserted him. The 
man, that was all — unless one 
threw in .the little black mustache 
and the smooth salesman's manner. 



"You know, Cass," Tennant said 
quietly, "I never for a moment 
dreamed it would be you." 

"Roger'." Agatha found her 
voice. "You're alive/" 

"Roger," repeated Tennant viciously. He felt sick with disgust. 
Maybe he should have expected a 
triangle, but somehow he hadn't. 
And here it was, with all of them 
going through their paces like a trioof tent-show actors. He said, "For 
God's sake, sit down." 

Agatha did so hesitantly. Her 
huge dark eyes, invariably clear and 
limpid no matter how much she 
had drunk, flickered toward him 
furtively. She said defensively, "I 
had detectives looking for you for 
six months. Where have you been, 
Rog? Smashing up the car like that 
and — disappearing! I've been out 
of my mind." 

"Sorry," said Tennant. "I've had 
my troubles, too." Agatha was 
scared stiff — of him. Probably with 
reason. He looked again at Cass 
Gordon and found that he suddenly didn't care. She couldn't say 
it was loneliness. Women have 
waited longer than eighteen 
months. He would have if his captors had let him. 

"Where in hell have you been, 
Rog?" Gordon's tone was almost 
parental. "I don't suppose it's news 
to you, but there was a lot of suspicion directed your way while that 
crazy killer was operating around 
here. Agatha and I managed to 
clear you."

"Decent of you," said Tennant. 
He got up, crossed to the cabinet 
that served as a bar. It was fully 
equipped — with more expensive 
liquor, he noticed, than he had 
ever been able to afford. He poured 
a drink of brandy, waited for the 
others to fill their glasses. 

AGATHA looked at him over 
the rim of hers. "Tell us, 
Rog. We have a right to know. T 
do, anyway." 

"One question first," he said. 
"What about those killings? Have 
there been any lately?" 

"Not for over a year," Cass told 
> him. "They never did get the devil 
who skinned those bodies and removed the heads." 

So, Tennant thought, they hadn't 
used the gateway. Not since they 
had brought the four of them 
through, not since they had begun 
to train him for his Judas ram 
duties. 

Agatha was asking him if he had 
been abroad. 

"In a way," he replied unemotionally. "Sorry if I've worried you, 
Agatha, but my life has been rather 
— indefinite, since I — left." 

He was standing no more than 
four inches from this woman he 
had desired desperately for six 
years, and he no longer wanted 
her. He was acutely conscious of 
her perfume. It wrapped them both 
like an exotic blanket, and it repelled him. He studied the firm 
clear flesh of her cheek and chin, 



the arch of nostril, the carmine 
fullness of lower lip, the swell of 
bosom above low-cut gown. And he 
no longer wanted any of it or of 
her. Cass Gordon — 

It didn't have to be anybody at 
all. For it to be Cass Gordon was 
revolting. 

"Rog," she said and her voice 
trembled, "what are we going to 
do? What do you want to do?" 

Take her back? He smiled ironically; she wouldn't know what that 
meant. It would serve her right, but 
maybe there was another way. 

"I don't know about you," he 
said, "but I suspect we're in the 
same boat. I also have other interests." 

"You louse!" said Cass Gordon, 
arching rib cage and nostrils. "If 
you try to make trouble for Agatha, 
I can promise . . ." 

"What can you promise?" demanded Tennant. When Gordon's 
onset subsided in mumbles, he 
added, "Actually, I don't think I'm 
capable of making more than a 
fraction of the trouble for either of 
you that you both are qualified to 
make for yourselves." 

He lit a cigarette, inhaled. "Relax. I'm not planning revenge. 
After this evening, I plan to vanish 
for good. Of course, Agatha, that 
offers you a minor nuisance. You 
will have to wait six years to marry 
Cass — seven years if the maid who 
let me in tonight talks. That's the 
law, isn't it, Cass? You probably 
had it all figured out."

"You bastard," said Cass. "You 
dirty bastard! You know what a 
wait like that could do to us." 

"Tristan and Isolde," said Tennant, grinning almost happily. 
"Well, I've had my little say. Now 
I'm off again. Cass, would you give 
me a lift? I have a conveyance of 
sorts a couple of miles down the 
road." 

HE NEEDED no telepathic 
powers to read the thoughts 
around him then. He heard Agatha's quick intake of breath, saw the 
split-second look she exchanged 
with Cass. He turned away, knowing that she was imploring her 
lover to do something, anything, as 
long as it was safe. 

Deliberately, Tennant poured 
himself a second drink. This might 
be easier and pleasanter than he 
had expected. They deserved some 
of the suffering he had had and 
there was a chance that they might 
get it. 

Tennant knew now why he was 
the only male_ human the captors 
had been able to take alive. Apparently, thanks to the rain-slick 
road, he had run the sedan into a 
tree at the foot of the hill beyond 
the river. He had been sitting there, 
unconscious, ripe fruit on their 
doorstep. They had simply picked 
him up. 

Otherwise, apparently, men were 
next to impossible for them to 
capture. All they could do was kill 
them and bring back their heads

and hides as trophies. With women 
it was different — perhaps the captors' weapons, whatever they were, 
worked more efficiently on females. 
A difference in body chemistry or 
psychology, perhaps. 

More than once, during his long 
training with Opal, Tennant had 
sent questing thoughts toward his 
captor, asking why they didn't simply set up the gateway in some 
town or city and take as many humans as they wanted. 

Surprisingly there had been a 
definite fear reaction. As nearly as 
he could understand, it had been 
like asking an African pygmy, 
armed with a blowgun, to set up 
shop in the midst of a herd of 
wild elephants. It simply wasn't 
feasible — and furthermore he derived an impression of the tenuosity 
as well as the immovability of the 
gateway itself. 

They could be hurt, even killed 
by humans in a three-dimensional 
world. How? Tennant did not 
know. Perhaps as a man can cut 
finger or even throat on the edge 
of a near-two-dimensional piece of 
paper. It took valor for them to 
hunt men in the world of men. In 
that fact lay a key to their character — if such utterly alien creatures 
could be said to have character. 

CASS GORDON was smiling at 
him, saying something about 
one for the road. Tennant accepted 
only because it was luxury to drink 
liquor that smelled and tasted as 

■ 45

liquor should. He raised his glass 
CD Agatha, said, "I may turn up 
again, but it's unlikely, so have 
yourself a time, honey." 

"Oh, Rog!" said Agatha and 
her eyes were fraudulently wet. 
Tennant felt pure contempt. She 
knew that Cass intended to try to 
kill him — and she couldn't play 
it straight. She had to ham it up 
with false emotion, even though 
she had silently pleaded with her 
lover to do something, anything. 
He put down his empty glass. The 
thought that he had spent eighteen 
months yearning for this sheSmithfield like a half-damp puppy 
made 'him almost physically ill. 

"You'll make out," he told her 
with savage sincerity. In her way, 
in accord with her desires, Agatha 
would. At bottom she was, he 
realized, as primitive, as realistic, 
as the three who waited beyond 
the gateway. An ex- waitress, an 
ex-forewoman, an ex-model of 
mediocre success — and Agatha. He 
tried to visualize his wife as a 
member of his involuntary harem 
and realized that she would adapt 
as readily as the other women. But 
he didn't want her. 

He turned away and said, 
"Ready, Cass?" 

"Right with you," the ex-halfback replied, hurrying toward the 
hall. Tennant considered, took another drink for his own road. The 
signals had been given, the game 
was being readied. He had no wish 
to upset the planning. He had 

46 



some plans also, and theirs gave 
his enough moral justification to 
satisfy his usually troublesome 
conscience. 

Agatha put her arms around his 
neck. She was warm and soft and 
moist of lip and playing her part 
with obvious enjoyment of its 
bathos. She murmured, "I'm so 
sorry, Rog, darling — " 

"Cut!" he said almost in a snarl 
and wrenched free. He brought 
out a handkerchief — he had remembered to have one created, 
praise Allah — and rubbed lipstick from his face. He tossed the 
handkerchief to Agatha. 

"You might have this analyzed," 
he told her lightly. "It could be 
interesting. The handkerchief, 
not the lipstick." 

"I'm glad you're going!" she 
blazed, although her voice was 
low. "I'm glad you're going. I 
hope you never come back." 

"That," he told her, "makes 
exactly two of us. Have fun." 

He went out into the hall, where 
Cass was waiting, wearing what 
was intended to be a smile. They 
went out to the car together — it 
was a big convertible — and Cass 
got behind the wheel. He .said, 
"Where to, old man?" 

"The Upham Road," said Tennant, feeling nothing at all. 

CASS got the car under way 
and Tennant sensed them 
coming through. They warned 
him that his chauffeur was carry

 



ing a weapon concealed in an inside pocket, 

As if I didn't knoiv! Tennant 
snapped back at them. 

Cass tried to drive him past the 
spot beyond the bridge where the 
gateway lay hidden in its armor of 
invisibility. He evidently planned 
to go miles from the house before 
doing whatever he had decided to 
do. 

Tennant thought he knew. It 
would involve riding the back 
roads like this one for fifteen or 
twenty miles, perhaps farther. He 
suspected that the quarry pond in 
South Upham was his intended 
destination. There would be 
plenty of loose rock handy with 
which to weigh down his body 
before dumping it into the water. 

If it were recovered, Cass and 
Agatha could alibi one another. 
In view of his earlier disappearance, this would be simple. Of 
course there was the maid, but 
Cass had enough money and 
smooth talk to manage that angle. 
They could undoubtedly get away 
with killing him. 

"Stop," said Tennant, just 
across the bridge. 

"What for?" Cass countered 
and Tennant knew it was time to 
act. He wrenched the key _from 
the ignition switch, tossed it out 
of the car. Cass braked, demanded, "What in hell did you do 
that for?" 

"I get out here," Tennant said. 
"You didn't stop." 



"Okay, if that's the way you 
want it." Cass' heavy right hand, 
the little black hairs on its back 
clearly visible in the dashboard 
light, moved toward his inside 
pocket. 

Tennant teleported to the side 
of the road, became a half-visible 
shade against the darkness of the 
trees. He felt Opal's excitement 
surge through his brain, knew that 
from then on his timing would 
have to be split-second perfect. 

It seemed to him as if all the 
inchoate thoughts, all the vague 
theories, all the half-formed plans 
of more than a year had crystalized. For the first time since his 
capture, he not only knew what he 
wanted to do — but saw the faint 
glimmer of a chance of doing it 
successfully. 

He was going to try to lead 
Cass to the gateway, maneuver him 
inside — and then escape. They 
wouldn't get Tennant; the power 
of teleportation they themselves 
had given him would keep him 
from being captured again. It 
would work. He was sure of it. 
They'd have their male specimen 
and he'd be free . . . not to go 
back to Agatha, because he 
wouldn't, but to help the three 
women to get back, too. 

CASS was plunging after him 
now, pistol in hand, shouting. Tennant could have him 
killed now, have him flayed and 
decapitated as other male victims

had been. Opal might even give 
him the hide as a reward after it 
was treated. Some Oriental potentate, Tennant reflected, might relish having his wife's lover as a 
rug on his living room floor. Tennant preferred the l,ess operatic 
revenge of leaving Cass and 
Agatha alive to suffer. 

iHe teleported farther into the 
trees, closer to the gateway, plotting carefully his next moves. Cass 
was crashing along, cursing in 
frustration. 

"Stand still, damn you! You 
shift around like a ghost!" 

Tennant realized with sudden 
terror that Cass might give up, 
unable to solve his prey's abrupt 
appearances and disappearances. 
He needed encouragement to keep 
him going. 

Jeeringly, Tennant paused, 
simultaneously thumbed his nose 



and stuck out his tongue at Cass. 
The scornful childishness of the 
gesture enraged Cass more than 
the worst verbal insult could have. 
He yelled his anger and fire'd at 
Tennant. There was no way to 
miss, but Tennant was five yards 
farther on before the explosion 
ended. 

"Calm down," he advised quietly. "Getting mad always spoils 
your aim." 

That, naturally, made Cass even 
angrier. He fired viciously twice 
more before Tennant reached the 
gateway, both times without a 
chance of hitting his elusive target. 

Opal, Tennant discovered, was 
almost as frantic as Cass. He was 
deep inside the passage, jittering 
visibly in his excitement, in his 
anticipation of the most important 
bag his species had yet made on 



48 




 



Earth. And there was something 
else in his thoughts. . . . 

Anxiety. Fear. The gateway was 
vulnerable to third-dimensional 
weapons. Where the concertinalike passage came into contact 
with Earth, there was a belt, perhaps a foot in width, which was 
spanned by some sort of forcewebbing. Opal was afraid that a 
bullet might strike the webbing 
and destroy the gateway. 

Cass was getting closer. It 
would be so easy . . . keep teleporting, bewilder him, let him 
make a grab . . . and then skip a 
hundred yards away just as the 
gateway shut. He would be outside, Cass inside. 

And the three women? Leave 
them with Cass? Leave the gateway open for more live or mounted specimens? 

Tennant cpncentrated on the 



zone of strain at the point of dimensional contact, was there 
directly in front of it. Cass, cursing, lunged clear of the underbrush outside, saw Tennant there. 
Tennant was crouching low, not 
moving, staring mockingly at him. 
He lifted the automatic and fired. 

TENNANT teleported by inches 
instead of yards, and so blood 
oozed from a graze on his left ear 
when he rejoined a shaken Opal 
in the world that knew no night. 
For a long time — how long,* of 
course, he could not know — they 
stood and watched the gateway 
burn to globular ash in a dark 
brown fire that radiated searing 
cold. 

Opal was in trouble. An aura 
of anger, of grief, of accusation, 
surrounded him. Others of them 
came and for a while Tennant

was forgotten. Then, abruptly, he 
was back in his own compound, 
walking toward the house. 

In place of his country Napoleonic roll-bed, which he had 
visualized for manufacture with 
special care, Dana had substituted 
an immense modern sleeping device that looked like a low hassock 
with a ten-foot diameter. She was 
on her knees, her back toward the 
door, fiddling with a radio. 

She heard him enter, said without turning, "It won't work. Just 
a little while ago it stopped." 

"I think we're cut off now, perhaps for good," he told her. He 
sat down on the edge of the absurd bed and began to take off the 
clothes they had given him for the 
hunt. He was too tired to protest 
against the massacre of his bedroom decor. He was not even sure 
he wanted to protest. For all its 
anachronism, the big round bed 
was comfortable. 

She watched him, her hands on 
her thighs, and there was worry 
written on her broad forehead. 
"You know something, Rog." 

"I don't know anything," he replied. "I only think and have 
theories." Unexpectedly he found 
himself telling her all about it, 
about himself, where he had been, 
what he had done. 

She listened quietly, saying 
nothing, letting him go on. His 
head was in her lap and he talked 
up to her while she ran gentle fingers through his hair. When he 



had finished, she smiled down at 
him thoughtfully, affectionately, 
then said, "You know, you're a 
funny kind of man, Roger." 
"Funny?" 

She cuffed him gently. "You 
know what I mean. So now we're 
really cut off in this place — you 
and me and little Tom and Olga 
and Eudalia and the twins. What 
are we going to do, Roger?" 

He shrugged. He was very 
tired. "Whatever they'll let us do," 
he said through a yawn. "Maybe 
we can make this a two-way study. 
They are almost human, you 
know. Almost." He pulled her 
down and kissed her and felt unexpected contentment decant 
through his veins. He knew now 
that things had worked out the 
right way, the only way. He added 
aloud, "I think we'll find ways to 
keep ourselves amused." 

"You really enjoy playing the 
heel, don't you, Rog?" Her lips 
moved against his as she spoke. 
"You had a chance to get out of 
here. You could have changed 
places with Cass. Maybe you could 
have destroyed the gateway and 
stayed on the other side and still 
saved other victims. But no, you 
had to come back to — us. I think 
I'm going to be in love with you 
for that." 

He sat up on one elbow and 
looked down at her half angrily. 
"Are you trying to make a goddam 
hero out of me?" he asked.
