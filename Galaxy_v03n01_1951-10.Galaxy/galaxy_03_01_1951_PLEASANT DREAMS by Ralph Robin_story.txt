PLEASANT DREAMS by Ralph Robin




"YOUR wife is beautiful 
and a charming hostess 
and very interesting " 
the visitor bubbled. 

"Isn't she?" Gniss said. "I married her only last year. I was 
especially taken with her dark 
hair. That's extremely rare, you 
know."
They walked into Gniss's most 



private office, and soft lights 
came on. The visitor gazed 
around, surprised. 

"I see you are looking for the 
desk or table. Men of my rank 
don't use any," Gniss said. 

There were not even chairs, 
only the couches affected in late 
years by fashionable, people,. 
Gniss dropped onto one, grunting and waved the visitor to another. 

"Do you know what this divan 
I'm lying on is covered with?" 
Gniss did not wait for an answer. 
"Cloth made from the cocoons 
of moth larvae by an incredibly 
ancient and expensive method." 

The visitor shook his head in 
wonderment. The couch'- he was 
on was upholstered more modest


ly in plastic — of the very best 
quality, of course. 

"It must be convenient to live 
right where you work," the visitor 
said. 

They had just dined in Gniss's 
apartment, the official residence 
of the Chief Watcher. The apartment was a grand affair; since 
the time that Gniss had risen to 



PLEASANT DREAMS 



Chief Watcher, it had spread 
through a whole floor of the immense building. 

"My wife says I might not 
work at night so much if I lived 
farther away," Gniss pointed out. 

*'Is there much to do at night?" 
the visitor asked. 

*'I don't have my title for nothing! Even while they sleep, we 
watch them." 

"You mean you put microphones under suspects' beds and 
listen to them talk in their sleep?" 
The visitor smiled to show that 
he was joking. 

Gniss bellowed and shook, surprising the visitor, who thought 
the response was more than his 
feeble little joke deserved. But 
the good-natured laughter was 
something to remember, he noted 
for his mental scrapbook. At 
school, Gniss had been rather a 
dour boy. 

"My dear fellow," Gniss said 
when he had control of his voice 
again, "they were doing that centuries before the first dispersal of 
man. Look at this!" 

He shifted on his couch and 
began to play with a little jeweled wheel projecting from the 
wall. A section of the floor — at 
least a quarter of the large room 
— rose on slender pillars to make 
a platform. Under the platform, 
the purple floor appeared unchanged. 

Gniss rolled his heavy body on 



one side and talked, it seemed to 
the visitor, to his pillow. 

"Give me Blor," he said. 

The visitor could see a faint 
haze eddy above the platform. 
Nothing else happened. 

"Oh, well," said Gniss. "He 
rarely sleeps in his own bed— 
that's what makes him useful. 
But he's only a double spy." 

The visitor's eyes were wide. 
Only a double spy! 

"Ill show you something really 
big," Gniss said. He spoke gently 
to the pillow: "Give me Stak." 

"Not — " the visitor blurted. 

"Correct," Gniss said. "The famous rebel." 

"But I thought—" 

"That we couldn't catch up 
with him? That's what we let out 
for the public, and.wiaturally, for 
him. But we ran him down, and 
now we are watching him in a 
hundred different ways. If we arrested him, he would undoubtedly kill himself. That's something 
that even my watchers can't stop 
a determined man from doing. 
But before he dies, we want to 
find out who the traitor was that 
kept him informed of the government's plans during the critical 
time last year." 

The visitor hadn't known, of 
course, that Stak had made use 
of an agent in official circles, but 
he was discreet enough to say 
nothing. It frightened him a little 
to hear such portentous matters, 



44 




 



yet it flattered him, too, that his 
old school friend would be so 
open with him. 

The haze above the platform 
deepened, and shone with internal 
light. The platform itself began 
to glow and to vibrate on its delicate pillars. Or perhaps it did not 
move* perhaps it was an illusion 
from the shimmering light. 

The visitor did not know what 
to expect, but he felt a warm ripple of excitement. He glanced at 
Gniss. His host was watching the 
platform with an indefinable expression, in which there was at 
least some official — or was it 
fashionable? — weariness. 

We has seen so much, the visitor thought, turning back to the 
platform. 

Vaporous waves of light were 
rolling straight up, to dissipate; 
the visitor did not know where. 
The waves split and were less like 
waves and then were not waves 
at all. They were vague forms, 
gray and colored: some suggested 
people; some suggested things. 
Continually, they changed in 
shape and in size and in color. 

"They are dreams!" the visitor 
exclaimed. 

"Stak's dreams," Gniss said. 
"Now we are getting some continuity. Look." 

"Where is Stak?" 

"Oh, you rarely see the dreamer. You see through bis eyes. 
That woman — the old woman 



with the young face; it's an odd 
angle, and the water and the 
steam and the bare arms — he 
must be dreaming he's a child 
and she's giving him a bath. It's 
unfortunate she didn't drown 
him." 

The woman melted, faded, and 
a green billow was a wood and 
was separating into trees, and 
there was a kind of park. A Iamb 
with a very intelligent face walked around a tree. Suddenly the 
lamb opened its mouth and cried 
like a human baby. 

The visitor was startled. It was 
the first sound from the dream 
projection. 

"You mean you can hear the 
dreams too?" he asked naively. 

"Of course, my friend. Our 
technical people are talented." 

'T should say! Tell me, how is 
it all done?" 

"Well, we were working 
along at a telepathic instrument, 
which isn't quite perfected yet. 
Thoughts, you know, are produced by electrical impulses in 
the brain and these induce weak 
electromagnetic fields. Our theory 
was to build up the patterns of 
visual and auditory thoughts 
from the electromagnetic fields. 
For some reason the instrument 
hasn't worked right as a general 
device, but we found out by accident that it worked perfectly 
for dreams. Dreams are a form 
of thought, but there is a subtle 



PLEASANT DREAMS 



45 



difference in the fields." 

"Marvelous t" exclaimed the 
visitor. He had not noticed the 
metamorphosis of the technical 
people into "we." 

Wait till I tell my children, the 
visitor thought. But maybe he 
had better not say anything at 
all about his call on Gniss. He 
smiled as he remembered how his 
children had tried to talk him out 
of visiting his old schoolmate. 

"Visit the museums," they had 
told him. "The art galleries. Go 
inside that big statue of Kumat. 
See the insect zoo — it's a wonderful place and very educational." The youngsters had been to 
the capital twice, their father 
never, and they were very knowing. "There's plenty to do without looking for trouble," his boy 
Trenr had insisted. 

"But Gniss and I were great 
friends at school, and Tin a respectable citizen. Why should 
Gniss cause me trouble?'* he had 
asked, puzzled. 

Images came into being on the 
stage, and vanished, in a bizarre 
panorama. Uniformed watchers, 
already taller than a dream roof, 
grew still taller until their heads 
were lost in the real ceiling. Their 
monstrous hands held hoopshaped mind-rippers. A terrified 
' voice cried, "No — no— no — " over 
and over. The word filled the 
room. 

The visitor felt a surge of pity 



for the trapped outlaw, lost now 
in the nightmare of fear. Yet he 
said scornfully, as much to himself as to Gniss, "He's a coward 
after all, isn't he?" 

"Everyone's a coward," Gniss 
replied. "But, awake, Stak is less 
a coward than most." 

The nightmare dissolved into 
confused patterns; the terrified 
voice dropped to a thin, wordless 
babble. The dream projection focused to a sort of cellar. Twenty 
or thirty men and women were 
sitting on the floor. Their faces 
were turned toward Gniss and 
the visitor. 

"He's dreaming about a meeting, and I think he's making a 
speech," Gniss said. "This is likely to be useful. Naturally it's 
being watched in the regular 
monitoring chambers. Our monitors will try to identify everybody 
at the meeting. There are difficulties. Sometimes several faces 
are blended into one in a dream. 

"Look at those expressions! 
The sentimental fool thinks all 
his followers are noble souls. See 
that skinny fellow to the left? He 
positively drips nobility of soul. 
And that woman over there? She 
belongs in heaven. And will get 
there soon, no doubt," Gniss 
added with a laugh. 

The visitor found himself saying, "But dreams are all pretty 
much 1 mixed up. Isn't it possible 
he might put a chance acquain

tance at one of those dream meetings? Or someone he saw on the 
street? Couldn't it happen to 
anybody?" 

"We try to be as fair as we 
can. But you know the old saying: 4 It is far better that ten innocent men be punished than that 
one guilty man go free.' " 

"That's very true," the visitor 
said earnestly, "and everyone 
must be assumed to be guilty 
until he can prove his innocence." 

Gniss motioned for him to be 
quiet. Stale's muttering voice was 
gaining strength. It sounded more 
like language, and soon the visitor could pick out words. 

"... choose . . . happy and 
free . . . man's will . . . life . , . 
sacrifice . . . era . . . Gniss . . 

The word was unmistakable. 

Gniss roared his laughter. "I'm 
even in their dreams. But I suppose this must be boring you. 
Shall I turn it off? I can always 
have it repeated by the recording 
system, if I need to see it later." 
His hand was at the little jeweled 
wheel. 

"I'm enjoying it," the visitor 
protested. 

"Would you rather take a walk 
through some of the installations? 
We work around the clock, you 
know. We could look in at the 
classification laboratory where 
we catalogue everybody by the 
positions of the atoms in their 
chromosomes. Give the techni


cian a piece of your fingernail or 
a bit of hair or a scraping of skin 
— anything that contains at least 
one whole cell — and in five minutes he'll tell you your name. Or 
we could visit the mind -ripper 
range where we train recruits." 

"I'd rather not see that," the 
visitor said. In the back of his 
mind was a rumor about the 
mind -ripper range that he had 
tried not to listen to. 

"The targets for today didn't 
prove their innocence," Gniss explained drily. His hand was still 
at the wheel. "Well?" 

"Let's watch it a little more,** 
the visitor said. "It's changii.g to 
something new." 

"H'mm, so it is. This looks interesting." 

It was the park where the lamb 
had walked around the tree and 
cried. But there was no lamb: 
there was a young woman, walking, alone. She was wearing a 
long cloak of a kind out of fashion for several years, but, the 
visitor thought, more becoming 
than the short cloaks the women 
were wearing now. Her yellow 
hair was loosely tied with a filmy 
scarf. Her face was more beautiful than any real face the visitor 
had ever seen. 

It was a face of delicate symmetry; of early love; of high intelligence. 

Gniss raised himself and leaned 
on his elbow. "We know that Stale 



PLEASANT DREAMS 



hasn't had a woman for some 
time, at least since we closed in. 
Watch, she'll be taking that cloak 
off pretty soon — and the rest of 
her clothes, too, no doubt. That's 
usual in dreams." 

The visitor was shocked, but 
he tried to keep from showing it. 
"Be as good as the nakeds I used 
to go to when I was a young fellow." he said bravely. 

As a matter of fact, he had always gone only to the halfn.akcds and had taken his wife 
Naid, both before they were married and afterwards. People had 
laughed at their being together 
so much, but they had had a fine 
life together. Then Naid had died 
while the children were still 
small. He wondered whether he 
ever dreamed of Naid. He never 
could remember his own dreams, 
probably because he ■ generally 
jumped out of bed so quickly and 
went about the day's business. 

On the dream stage, the image 
of a man was standing beside the 
girl. The man was young and 
was wearing the kind of clothes 
that students wore, and he was 
holding the girl's hand. 

"It's Stak," Gniss said. "This is 
the less common kind of dream, 
though usual enough, where the 
dreamer seems to be watching 
himself from the outside. We get 
a full view of him then and we 
see his actions. It's the kind of 
dream that's clearest and gives 



us the best information. I recognize the girl now — Lell. She used 
to be Stak's sweetheart." He said 
the word contemptuously. "She 
was executed when he was first 
joining the revolt." 

The dream couple embraced in 
pantomime. The scene was very 
real, and it was hard for the 
visitor to remember that these 
were only images from a dreaming brain. His knowledge that the 
girl was dead added a strange 
quality to the scene. 

While he was thinking that this 
bright girl had been given to the 
sacred death birds — if indeed her 
body had been treated with such 
respect — Stak cried out: "It's 
you, Lell! But you're dead!" 

Lell answered, "I've come back, 
darling. I've come back for your 
sake." 

Now she did unfasten her 
cloak. Gniss chuckled and the 
visitor tried to chuckle as Stak 
was helping her to take off her 
clothes with frantic hands. But 
in a moment she was dressed 
again and beyond his reach. 

"I'm dead, I'm dead, I'm 
dead," she was saying, and then 
she was not Lell at all, but another woman. The cloak she was 
wearing was short and her head 
was bare in the new style — and 
her hair was dark. 

Gniss made a noise that could 
have been a breath, but sounded 
more like a growl or a cry. 



OAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



It was a noise that made sweat 
extrude from the visitor's forehead, made his throat tighten as 
if he would never swallow again. 
He saw himself in the great statue 
of Kumat with other middle-aged 
tourists. He saw himself watching the fishes in the Luminous 
Pond. He saw himself at his desk 
in the criteria room, where he 
had worked for thirty years. 

He saw the sacred death birds 
circle and lower. 

The visitor made an effort to 
collect himself. He must decide 
whether it was better to speak or 
to be silent, to go on looking or 
to turn away. He did not know. 
The man on the couch of cocoon 
cloth was no longer his old 
schoolfellow; he was the Chief 
Watcher. 

On the stage, the dark dream 
woman moved closer to Stak. "I 
love you too, Stak. I am not Lell. 
Lell is dead. I am Orv. But I 
love you, too." 

Stak said, "To love me is todie. Even to know me is to die." 

"What difference does that 
make? We are all going to die 
some day. Why not die to bring 
a time when others can be, free? 
Happy and free — unhappy and 
free — free!" 

"My wife," Gniss said, in a 
terrible voice. "My wife Orv." 

Now it was in the open, and 
the visitor knew he had to speak. 
He turned to Gniss. "It's a trick, 



of course. He got hold of a picture somehow. He knows his 
dreams are being watched, and 
rebels must have found some way 
of controlling their dreams. It can 
be done, you know. You consciously pick a subject or a person — " 

"Be quiet." the Chief Watcher 
said, and the visitor regretted 
that he had spoken. 

Gniss never took his eyes from 
the dream projection, but the visitor would not look. Already, he 
had seen too much. 

He could not help hearing, 
though. Dream-Stak and dreamOrv spoke lovingly, eagerly. 
Their words grew more intense, 
were blurred, became rhythmic 
sobs. 

Then there was silence. The 
visitor looked again. The images 
were gone. The lifeless platform 
was sinking into the floor. 

Gniss said in a cold, faraway 
voice, "I will have to dispose of 
them. And of you, I am afraid. 
You may have heard the proverb 
of the North Tribes: 'Who sees 
what the gods want hidden had 
better been born blind.' I was at 
fault in bothering, childishly 
enough, to impress an old friend 
— but I have got where I am by 
making sure that other peopla 
expiate my faults." 

"Surely, Gniss, you don't believe it. You must realize it's a 
trick." The visitor's voice was 



PLEASANT DREAMS 



19 



shrill with fear. 

"It's not a trick. There were 
several reports, ambiguously 
phrased. 1 would not understand 
them; or, if I understood them, 
I would not believe them." 

The visitor thought again of 
his children's advice. If only he 
had listened to them! He pictured 
them in his mind: his son, nineteen-year-old Trenr: his daughter, sixteen-year-old Zhom. They 
were so wise, yet so foolish in 
many ways, and so young. Knowing he would have to return to 
them, he grew calm. 

He rose from the couch and. 
speaking slowly and steadily, said 
to the Chief Watcher: "You told 
me yourself that Stak's dreams 
were shown in the regular monitoring chambers, that they were 
recorded. And there are the reports you mention. How can this 
thing be kept secret? A hundred 
people must know about it besides me. A hundred and one 
can't make it any worse. 

"Do you really think that by 
killing me you can stop the story 
from reaching high men in the 
Government? I am only an ordinary citizen, but even I have 
heard of the rivalry among you 
I>owerful men. 

"Gniss, you are destroyed. Destroying me won't save you. 
Nothing can save you. You may 
as well let me go home." 

Gniss reacted in an astonishing 



way. He let loose his bellowing 
laugh. 

"You have led loo obscure a 
life," he said, choking. "You 
could have made a career for 
yourself here. You have just 
achieved something that calls Tor 
unusual talent — you've won a 
point simply by stating the obvious truth. I was only fooling 
myself, I see now. As you say, I 
am destroyed. I'll kill myself, of 
course." 

Gniss put his hand to tlx j< weled wheel. The red and blue and 
green gems twinkled between his 
fat fingers. 

"Go out that way." Gniss said, 
and the visitor turned and saw 
that the wall had opened to a 
small elevator. "It will take you 
to an unguarded door." 

"Good-by," said the visitor. 
"An old friend's good-by. I know 
I will never see you again." 

"Never," Gniss said gravely. 
"Good-by, old schoolfellow." 

There were tears in the visitor's eyes as he walked into the 
elevator. As soon as he had entered, the door automatically 
closed, and the elevator automatically carried him to a lower 
floor, where it automatically and 
completely disposed of him. 

Nothing was left for the sacred 
death birds. 

"Little people, little minds," 
Gniss said. "As if killing oneself 
were all a man could do."

Then he spoke to his pillow 
quietly, giving orders for a hundred deaths. His wife's, first; then 
Stak's; then . . . 

When he was through the list, 
he reconsidered and made it two 
hundred. 

The hour was late and Gniss 
was tired when his mistress 
greeted him in her house, in an 
old quarter of the city. 

They embraced. 

"Dear girl, dear Jenj," Gniss 
said. "I have had to work late. 
It's been a difficult day and I'm 
exhausted." 

"Poor darling," said Jenj. "Lie 
down right now and rest." 

Gniss stretched out on a couch, 
grunting comfortably. The plastic 
felt a bit chilly, and he thought, 
I'll have to find her some of that 
primitive larval stuff. 

A young man and a young 
woman walked in from another 
room. They were carrying small 
mind -rippers. 

"Get out of the way," the man 
said to Jenj. 

Jenj moved quickly. 

Gniss jumped to his feet. He 



started to say something, but the 
full force of two mind-rippers 
stopped him. His body fell back 
on the couch. 

Jenj began to cry. 

"What's the matter, Jenj?" the 
man said. "Think of Stale. Think 
of Orv. I have never taken part in 
an execution that I regret less." 

"You're not a woman," Jenj 
said, still crying. "After all, a 
woman can't simulate for so long 
without developing some emotional attachment, even for a 
monster like that." 

But she made an effort to be 
stern. 

"Who is going to take Stak's 
place?" she asked, as if nothing 
now remained to be said about 
Gniss. 

The man answered, "It's not 
definite yet. Maybe Trenr. He's 
young, but Stak thought highly 
of him. He's very capable." 

"And close - mouthed," the 
woman said. "Even his father, 
poor innocent, never knew Trenr 
was one of us. He was paying 
Gniss a social call. Imagine!"
