AMBITION By WILLIAM L BADE 

THERE was a thump. Maitland stirred, came half 
awake, and opened his 
eyes. The room was dark except 
where a broad shaft of moonlight 
from the open window fell on the 
foot of his bed, Outside, the residential section of the Reservation slept silently under the pale 
illumination of the full Moon. 
He guessed sleepily that it was 



about three o'clock. 

What had he heard? He had a 
definite impression that the sound 
had come from within the room. 
It had sounded like someone 
stumbling into a chair, or— 

Something moved in the darkness on the other side of the 
room. Maitland started to sit up 
and it was as though a thousand 
volts had shorted his brain . . . 




This time, he awoke more normally. He opened his eyes, looked 
through the window at a section 
of azure sky, listened to the singing of birds somewhere outside. 
A beautiful day. In the middle of 
the process of stretching his 
rested muscles, arms extended 
back, legs tensed, he froze, looking up — for the first time really 
seeing the ceiling. He turned his 
head, then rolled off the bed, wide 
awake. 

This wasn't his room! 

The lawn outside wasn't part 
of the Reservation! Where the 
labs and the shops should have 
been, there was deep prairie grass, 
then a green ocean pushed into 
waves by the breeze stretching to 
the horizon. This wasn't the California desert! Down the hill, 
where the liquid oxygen plant 
ought to have been, a river wound 
across the scene, almost hidden 
beneath its leafy roof of huge 
ancient trees. 

Shock contracted Maitland's 
diaphragm and spread through 
his body. His breathing quickened. Now he remembered what 
had happened during the night, 
.the sound in the darkness, the 
dimly seen figure, and then — 
What? Blackout . . . 

Where was he? Who had 
brought him here? For what purpose? 

He thought he knew the answer 
to the last of those questions. As a 



member of the original atomic 
reaction-motor team, he possessed information that other 
military powers would very much 
like to obtain. It was absolutely 
incredible that anyone had managed to abduct him from the 
heavily guarded confines of the 
Reservation, yet someone had 
done it. How? 

TTE pivoted to inspect the room. 

Even before his eyes could 
take in the details, he had the 
impression that there was something wrong about it. To begin 
with, the style was unfamiliar. 
There were no straight lines or 
sharp corners anywhere. The 
walls were paneled in featureless 
blue plastic and the doors were 
smooth surfaces of metal, half 
ellipses, without knobs. The flowing lines of the chair and table, 
built apparently from an aluminum alloy, somehow gave the 
impression of arrested motion. 
Even after allowances were made 
for the outlandish design, something about the room still was 
not right. 

His eyes returned to the doors, 
and he moved over to study the 
nearer one. As he had noticed, 
there was no knob, but at the 
right of this one, at about waist 
level, a push-button projected out 
of the wall. He pressed it; the 
door slid aside and disappeared. 
Maitland glanced in at the dis

closed bathroom, then went over 
to look at the other door. 

There was no button beside 
this one. nor any other visible 
means of causing it to open. 

^Baffled, he turned again and 
looked at the large open window 
— and realized what it was that 
had made the room seem so 
queer. 

It did not look like a jail cell. 
There were no bars . . . 

Striding across the room, he 
lunged forward to peer out and 
violently banged his forehead. He 
staggered back, grimacing with 
pain, then reached forward cautious fingers and discovered a 
hard sheet of stuff so transparent 
that he had not even suspected its 
presence. Not glass! Glass was 
never this clear or strong. A plastic, no doubt, but one he hadn't 
heard of. Security sometimes had 
disadvantages. 

He looked out at the peaceful 
vista of river and prairie. The 
character of the sunlight seemed 
to indicate that it was afternoon. 
He became aware that he was 
hungry. 

Where the devil could this 
place be? And — muscles tightened about his empty stomach — 
what was in store for him here? 

He stood trembling, acutely 
conscious that he was afraid and 
helpless, until a flicker of motion 
at the bottom of the hill near the 
river, drew his attention. Pressing 



his nose against the window, he 
strained his eyes to see what it 
was. 

A man and a woman were coming toward him up the hill. Evidently they had been swimming, 
for each had a towel; the man's 
was hung around his neck, and 
the woman was still drying her 
bobbed black hair. 

Maitland speculated on the 
possibility that this might be 
Sweden; he didn't know of any 
other country where public bathing at this time of year was customary. However, that prairie 
certainly didn't look Scandinavian . . . 

As they came closer, he saw 
that both of them had dark uniform suntans and showed striking 
muscular development, like persons who had trained for years 
with weights. They vanished below his field of view, presumably 
into the building. 

He sat down on the edge of the 
cot and glared helplessly at the 
floor. u 

A BOUT half an hour later, the 
door he couldn't open slid 
aside into the wall. The man 
Maitland had seen outside, now 
clad in gray trunks and sandals, 
stood across the threshold looking 
in at him. Maitland stood up and 
stared back, conscious suddenly 
that in his rumpled pajamas he 
■made an unimpressive figure. 



AMBITION 



The fellow looked about fortyfive. The first details Maitland 
noticed were the forehead, which 
was quite broad, and the calm, 
clear eyes. The dark hair, white 
,pt the temples, was combed back, 
still damp from swimming. Below, there was a wide mouth and 
a firm, rounded chin. 

This man was intelligent, Maitland decided, and extremely sure 
of himself. 

Somehow, the face didn't go 
with the rest of him. The man 
had the head of a thinker, the 
body v of a trained athlete — an unusual combination. 

Impassively, the man said, 
"My name is Swarts. You want 
to know where you are. I am not 
going to tell you." He had an accent, European, but otherwise unidentifiable. Possibly German. 
Maitland opened his mouth to 
protest, but Swarts went on, 
"However, you're free to do all 
the guessing you want." Still 
there was no suggestion of a 
smile. 

"Now, these are the rules. 
You'll be here for about a week. 
You'll have three meals a day, 
served in this room. You will not 
be allowed to leave it except when 
accompanied by myself. You will 
not be harmed in any way, provided you cooperate. And you can 
forget the silly idea that we want 
your childish secrets about rocket 
motors." Maitland's heart jump


ed. "My reason for bringing you 
here is altogether different. I want 
to give you some psychological 
tests ..." 

"Are you crazy?" Maitland 
asked quietly. "Do you realize 
that at this moment one of the 
greatest hunts in history must be 
going on? I'll admit I'm baffled 
as to where we are and how you 
got me here — but it seems to me 
that you could have found someone less conspicuous to give your 
tests to." 

Briefly, then, Swarts did smile. 
"They won't find you," he said. 
"Now, come with me." 

AFTER that outlandish cell, 
Swarts' laboratory looked 
rather commonplace. There was 
something like a surgical cot in 
the center, and a bench along one 
wall supported several electronics 
cabinets. A couple of them had 
cathode ray tube screens, and 
they all presented a normal complement of meters, pilot lights, 
and switches. Cables "from them 
ran across the ceiling and came 
to a focus above the high flat cot 
in the center of the room. 

"Lie down," Swarts said. When 
Maitland hesitated, Swarts added, "Understand one thing — the 
more you cooperate, the easier 
things will be for you. If necessary, I will use coercion, I can 
get all my results against your 
will, if I must. I would prefer 



ffft 




 



not to. Please don't make me." 

"What's the idea?" Maitland 
asked. "What is all this?" 

Swarts hesitated, though not, 
Maitland astonishedly felt, to 
evade an answer, but to find the 
proper words. "You can think of 
it as a lie detector. These instruments will record your reactions 
to the tests I give you. That is as 
much as you need to know. Now 
lie down." 

Maitland stood there for a moment, deliberately relaxing his 
tensed muscles. "Make me." 

If Swarts was irritated, he 
didn't show it. "That was the first 
test," he said. "Let me put it another way. I would appreciate it 
a lot if you'd He down on this cot. 
I would like to test my apparatus." 

Maitland shook his head stubbornly. 

"I see," Swarts said. "You want 
to find out what you're up 
against." 

He moved so fast that Maitland couldn't block the blow. It 
was to the solar plexus, just hard 
enough to double him up, fighting 
for breath. He felt an arm under 
his back, another behind his 
knees. Then he was on the cot. 
When he was able to breath 
again, there were straps across his 
chest, hips, knees, ankles, and 
arms, and Swarts was tightening 
a clamp that held his head immovable. 



Presently, a number of tiny 
electrodes were adhering to his 
temples and to other portions of 
his body, and a minute microphone was clinging to the skin 
over his heart. These devices terminated in cables that hung from 
the ceiling. A sphygmomanometer sleeve was wrapped tightly 
around his left upper arm, its 
rubber tube trailing to a small 
black box clamped to the frame 
of the cot. Another cable left the 
box and joined the others. 

So — Maitland thought — Swarts 
could record changes in his skin 
potential, heartbeat, and blood 
pressure: the involuntary responses of the body to stimuli. 

The question was, what were 
the stimuli to be? 

"Your name," said Swarts, "is 
Robert Lee Maitland. You are 
thirty-four years old. You are an 
engineer, specialty heat transfer, 
particularly as applied to rocket 
motors . . . No, Mr. Maitland, I'm 
not going to question you about 
your work; just forget about it. 
Your home town is Madison, 
Wisconsin , , 

"You seem to know everything 
about me," Maitland said defiantly, looking up into the hanging forest of cabling. "Why this 
recital?" 

"I do not know everything 
about you — yet. And I'm testing 
the equipment, calibrating it to 
your reactions." He went on, 



AMBITION

**Your favorite recreations are 
chess and reading what you term 
science fiction. Maitland, how 
would you like to go to the 
Moon?" 

Something eager leaped in 
Maitland's breast at the abrupt 
question, and he tried to turn his 
head. Then he forced himself to 
relax. "What do you mean?" 

S warts was chuckling. "I really 
hit a semantic push-button there, 
didn't I? Maitland„ I brought you 
here because you're a mao who 
wants to go to the Moon. I'm interested in finding out why." 

TN THE evening a girl brought 
*■ Maitland his meal. As the door 
slid aside, he automatically stood 
up, and they stared at each other 
for several seconds. 

She had the high cheekbones 
and almond eyes of an Oriental, 
skin that glowed like gold in the 
evening light, yet thick coiled 
braids of blonde hair that glittered like polished brass. Shorts 
and a sleeveless blouse of some 
thick, reddish, metallic -looking 
fabric clung to her body, and over 
that she was wearing a light, ankle-length cloak of what seemed 
to be white wool. 

She was looking at him with 
palpable curiosity and something 
like expectancy. Maitland sighed 
and said, "Hello," then glanced 
down self-consciously at his wrinkled green pajamas. 



She smiled, -put the tray of food 
on the table, and swept out, her 
cloak billowing behind her. Maitland remained standing, staring 
at the closed door for a minute 
after she was gone. 

Later, when he had finished the 
steak and corn on the cob and 
shredded carrots, and a feeling of 
warm well-being was diffusing 
from his stomach to his extremities; he sat down on the bed to 
watch the sunset and to think. 

There were three questions for 
which he required answers before 
he could formulate any plan or 
policy. 

Where was he? 
Who was S warts? 
What was the purpose of the 
"tests" he was being given? 

It was possible, of course, that 
tin's was alt an elaborate scheme 
for getting military secrets, despite Swarts' protestations to the 
contrary. Maitland frowned. This 
place certainly didn't have the 
appearance of a military establishment, and so far there had 
been nothing to suggest the kind 
of interrogation to be expected 
from foreign intelligence officers. 

It might be better to tackle the 
first question first. He looked at 
the Sun, a red spheroid already 
half below the horizon, and tried 
to think of a region that had this 
kind of terrain. That prairie out 
there was unique. Almost anywhere in the world, land like that 




 



would be cultivated, not allowed 
to go to grass. 

This might be somewhere in 
Africa . . . 
He shook his head, puzzled. 
The Sun disappeared and its 
blood-hued glow began to fade 
from the sky. Maitland sat there, 
trying to get hold of the problem 
from an angle where it wouldn't 
just slip away. After a while the 
western sky became a screen of 
clear luminous blue, a backdrop 
for a pure white brilliant star. As 
always at that sight, Maitland 
felt his worry drain away, leaving an almost mystical sense of 
peace and an undefinable longing. 

Venus, the most beautiful of the 
planets. 

Maitland kept track of them 
all in their majestic paths through 
the constellations, but Venus was 
his favorite. Time and time again 
he had watched its steady climb 
higher and higher in the western 
sky, its transient rule there as 
evening star, its progression toward the horizon, and loved it 
equally in its alter ego of morning star. Venus was an old friend. 
An old friend 

Something icy settled on the 
back of his neck, ran down his 
spine, and diffused into his body. 
He stared at the planet unbelievingly, fists clenched, forgetting to breathe. 

Last night Venus hadn't been 
there. 



Venus was a morning star just 
now . . . 
Just now! 

He realized the truth in that 
moment. 

T ATER, when that jewel of a 
planet had set and the stars 
were out, he lay on the bed, still 
warm with excitement and relief. 
He didn't have to worry any more 
about military secrets, or who 
Swarts was. Those questions were 
irrelevant now.. And now he could 
accept the psychological tests at 
their face value; most likely, they 
were what they purported to be. 

Only one question of importance remained: 

What year was this? 

He grimaced in the darkness, 
an involuntary muscular expression of jubilation and excitement. 
The future! Here was the opportunity for the greatest adventure 
imaginable to 20th Century man. 

Somewhere, out there under the 
stars, there must be grand glittering cities and busy spaceports, 
roaring gateways to the planets. 
Somewhere, out there in the 
night, there must be men who 
had walked beside the Martian 
canals and pierced the shining 
cloud mantle of Venus — somewhere, perhaps, men who had visited the distant luring stars and 
returned. Surely, a civilization 
that had developed time travel 
could reach the stars! 



AMBITION 



5* 



And he had a chance to become 
a part of all that! He could spend 
his life among the planets, a citizen of deep space, a voyager of 
the challenging spaceways between the solar worlds. 

"I'm adaptable," he told himself gleefully. "I can learn fast. . 
There'll be a job for me out 
there . . ." 

It— 

Suddenly sobered, he rolled 
over and put his feet on the floor, 
sat in the darkness thinking. Tomorrow. Tomorrow he would 
have to find a way of breaking 
down Swarts' reticence. He would 
have to make the man realize 
that secrecy wasn't necessary in 
this case. And if Swarts still 
wouldn't talk, he would have to 
find a way of forcing the issue. 
The fellow had said that he didn't 
need cooperation to get his results, but — 

After a while Maitland smiled 
to himself and went back to bed. 

TTE WOKE in the morning with 
someone gently shaking his 
shoulder. He rolled over and 
looked up at the girl who had 
brought him his meal the evening 
before. There was a tray on the 
table and he sniffed the smell of 
bacon. The girl smiled at him. 
She was dressed as before, except that she had discarded the 
white cloak. 

As he swung his legs to the 



floor, she started toward the door, 
carrying the tray with the dirty 
dishes from yesterday. He stopped her with the word, "Miss!" 

She turned, and he thought 
there was something eager in her 
face. 

"Miss, do you speak my language?" 

"Yes," hesitantly. She lingered 
too long on the hiss of the last 
consonant. 

"Miss," he asked, watching her 
face intently, "what year is this?" 

Startlingly, she laughed, a mellow peal of mirth that had nothing forced about it. She turned 
toward the door again and said 
over her shoulder, "You will have 
to ask Swarts about that. I cannot tell you." 

"Wait! You mean you don't 
know?" 

She shook her head. "I cannot tell you." 

"All right; we'll let it go at 
that." 

She grinned at him again as the 
door slid shut. 

SWARTS came half an hour 
later, and Maitland began his 
planned offensive. 

"What year is this?" 
Swarts' steely eyes locked with 
his. "You know what the date is," 
he stated. 

"No, I don't. Not since yesterday." 

"Come on," Swarts said pa



 



tiently, "let's get going. We have 
a lot to get through this morning." 

"I know this isn't 1950. It's 
probably not even the 20th Century. Venus was a morning star 
before you brought me here. Now 
it's an evening star.*' 

"Never mind that. Come." 

Wordlessly. Maitland climbed 
to his feet, preceded Swarts to the 
laboratory, lay down and allowed 
him to fasten the straps and attach the instruments, making no 
resistance at all. When Swarts 
started saying a .list of words — 
doubtlessly some sort of semantic 
reaction test — Maitland began the 
job of integrating "csc"x dx" in 
his head. It was a calculation 
which required great concentration and frequent tracing back of 
steps. After several minutes, he 
noticed that Swarts had stopped 
calling words. He opened his eyes 
to find the other man standing 
over him, looking somewhat exasperated and a little baffled. 

"What year is this?" Maitland 
asked in a conversational tone. 

"We'll try another series of 
tests." 

It took Swarts nearly twenty 
minutes to set up the new apparatus. He lowered a bulky affair 
with two cylindrical tubes like 
the twin stacks of a binocular 
microscope over Maitland's head, 
so that the knses at the ends of 
the tubes were about half an 



inch from the engineer's eyes. He 
attached tiny clamps to Maitland's eyelashes. 

"These will keep you from 
holding your eyes shut," he said. 
"You can blink, but the springs 
are too strong for you to hold 
your eyelids down against the 
tension." 

He inserted button earphones 
into Maitland's ears — 

And then the show began. 

He was looking at a door in a 
partly darkened room, and there 
were footsteps outside, a peremptory knocking. The door flew 
open,, and outlined against the 
light of the hall, he saw a man 
with a twelve-gauge shotgun. The 
man shouted, "Now I've got you, 
you wife-stealer !" He swung the 
shotgun around and pulled the 
trigger. There was a terrible blast 
of sound and the flash of smokeless powder — then blackness. 

With a deliberate effort, Maitland unclenched his fists and tried 
to slow his breathing. Some kind 
of emotional reaction test — what 
was the countermove? He closed 
bis eyes, but shortly the muscles 
around them declared excruciatingly that they couldn't keep 
that up. 

Now he was looking at a girl. 
She . . . 

Maitland gritted his teeth and 
fought to use his brain; then he 
had it. 

He thought of a fat slob of a 



AMBITION 



41 



bully who had beaten him up 
one day after school. He remembered a talk he had heard by a 
politician who had all the intelligent social responsibility of a 
rogue gorilla, but no more. He 
brooded over the damnable stupidi ty and short -si ghtedness of 
Swarts in standing by his silly 
rules and not telling him about 
this new world. 

Within a minute, he was in an 
ungovernable rage. His muscles 
tightened against the restraining 
straps. He panted, sweat came out 
on his forehead, and he began to 
curse. Swarts! How he hated . . . 

The scene was suddenly a flock 
of sheep spread over a green hillside. There was blood hammering 
in Maitland's temples. His face 
felt hot and swollen and he writhed against the restraint of the 
straps. 

The scene disappeared, the 
lenses of the projector retreated 
from his eyes and Swarts was 
standing over him, white-lipped. 
Maitland swore at him for a few 
seconds, then relaxed and smiled 
weakly. His head was starting to 
ache from the effort of blinking. 

"What year is this?" he asked. 

"All right," Swarts said. "A.D. 
2634." 

Maitland's smile became a grin. 

"T REALLY haven't the time to 
waste talking irrelevancies," 
Swarts said a while later. *'Hon

estly. Maitland, I'm working 
against a time limit. If you'll cooperate, I'll tell Ching to answer 
your questions." 
"Ching?" 

"Ingrid Ching is the girl who 




AMBITION 



has been bringing you your 
meals." 

Maitland considered a moment, 
then nodded. Swarts lowered the 
projector to his eyes again, and 
this time the engineer did not resist. 

That evening, he could hardly 
wait for her to come. Too excited 
to sit and watch the sunset, he 
paced interminably about the 
room, sometimes whistling nervously, snapping his fingers, sitting 
down and jittering one leg. After 
a while he noticed that he was 
whistling the same theme over 
and over: a minute's thought 
identified it as that exuberant 
mounting phrase which recurs in 
the finale of Beethoven's Ninth 
Symphony. 

He forgot about it and went on 
whistling. He was picturing himself aboard a ship dropping in 
toward Mars, making planetfall 
at Sy rtis Major ; he was seeing 
visions of Venus and the awesome 
beauty of Saturn. In his mind, he 
circled the Moon, and viewed the 
Earth as a huge bright globe 
against the constellations . . . 

Finally the door slid aside and 
she appeared, carrying the usual 
tray of food. She smiled at him, 
making dimples in her golden 
skin and revealing a perfect set 
of teeth, and put the tray on the 
table. 

"1 think you are wonderful," 
she laughed. "You get everything 

63 



you want, even from Swarts, and 
I have not been able to get even 
a little of what I want from him. 
I want to travel in time, go back 
to your 20th Century. And I 
wanted to talk with you, and he 
would not let me." She laughed 
again, hands on her rounded hips. 
"I have never seen him so irritated as he was this noon." 

Maitland urged her into the 
chair and sat down on the edge of 
the bed. Eagerly he asked, "Why 
the devil do you want to go to 
the 20th Century? Believe me, 
I've been there, and what I've 
seen of this world looks a lot 
better." 

She shrugged. "Swarts says 
that I want to go back to the 
Dark Age of Technology because 
I have not adapted well to modern culture. Myself, I think I have 
just a romantic nature. Far times 
and places look more exciting . . ." 

"How do you mean — " Maitland wrinkled his brow — "adapt 
to modern culture? Don't tell me 
you're from another time!" 

"Oh, no! But my home is Aresund, a little fishing village at the 
head of a fiord in what you would 
call Norway. So far north, we are 
much behind the times. We live 
in the old way, from the sea, 
speak the old tongue." 

TJTE looked at her golden features, such a felicitous blend 
of Oriental and European char


acteristics, and hesitantly asked, 
"Maybe I shouldn't . . . This is a 
little personal, but . . . you don't 
look altogether like the Norwegians' of my time." 

His iear that she would be 
offended proved to be completely 
unjustified. She merely laughed 
and said, "There has been much 
history since 1950. Five hundred 
years ago, Europe was overrun 
by Pan-Orientals. Today you 
could not find anywhere a 'pure' 
European or Asiatic." She giggled. "Swarts' ancestors from 
your time must be cursing in 
their graves. His family is Afrikander all the way back, but one 
of his great-grandfathers was 
pure-blooded Bantu. His full 
name is Lassisi Swarts." 

Maitland wrinkled his brow. 
"Afrikander?" 

"The South Africans." Something strange came into her eyes. 
It might have been awe, or even, 
hatred; he could not tell. "The 
Pan-Orientals eventually conquered all the world, except for 
North America — the last remnant 
of the American World Empire — 
and southern Africa. The Afrikanders had been partly isolated 
for several centuries then, and 
they had developed technology 
while the rest of the world lost it. 
They had a tradition of white 
supremacy, and in addition they 
were terrified of being encircled." 
She sighed. "They ruled the next 



*4 




 



world empire and it was founded 
on the slaughter of one and a 
half billion human beings. That 
went into the history books as the 
War of Annihilation." 

"So many? How?" 

"They were clever with machines, the Afrikanders. They 
made armies of them. Armies of 
invincible killing-machines, produced in robot factories from 
robot-mined ores . , . Very clever." 
She gave a little shudder. 

"And yet they founded modern 
civilization," she added. "The 
grandsons of the technicians who 
built the Machine Army set up 
our robot production system, and 
today no human being has to 
dirty his hands raising food or 
manufacturing things. It could 
never have been done, either, before the population was — reduced 
to three hundred million." 

"Then the Afrikanders are still 
on top? Still the masters?" 

SHE shook her head. "There are 
no more Afrikanders." 
"Rebellion?" 

"No. Intermarriage. Racial 
blending. There was a psychology 
of guilt behind it. So huge a crime 
eventually required a proportionate expiation. Afrikaans is 
still the world language, but there 
is only one race now. No more 
masters or slaves." 

They were both silent for a moment, and then she sighed. "Let 



us not talk about them any 
more." 

"Robot factories and farms," 
Maitland mused. "What else? 
What means of transportation? 
Do you have interstellar flight 
yet?" 

"Inter-what?" 

"Have men visited the stars?" 

She shook her head, bewildered. 

"I always thought that would 
be a tough problem to crack," he 
agreed. "But tell me about what 
men are doing in the Solar System. How is life on Mars and 
Venus, and how long does it take 
to get to those places?" 

He waited, expectantly silent, 
but she only looked puzzled. "I 
don't understand. Mars? What 
are Mars?" 

After several seconds, Maitland 
swallowed. Something seemed to 
be the matter with his throat, 
making it difficult for him to 
speak. "Surely you have space 
travel?" 

She frowned and shook her 
head. "What does that mean — 
space travel?" 

He was gripping the edge of the 
bed now, glaring at her. "A civilization that could discover time 
travel and build robot factories 
wouldn't find it hard to send a 
ship to Mars!" 

"A ship? Oh, you mean something like a vliegvlotter. Why, no, 
I don't suppose it would be hard. 
But why would anyone want to

do a thing like that?'* 

He was on his feet towering 
over her, fists clenched. She 
raised her arms as if to shield her 
face if he should hit her. "Let's 
get this perfectly clear," he said, 
more harshly than he realized. 
"So far as you know, no one has 
ever visited the planets, and no 
one wants to. Is that right?" 

She nodded apprehensively. "I 
have never heard of it being 
done." 

He sank down on the bed and 
put his face in his hands. After a 
while he looked up and said bitterly, "You're looking at a man 
who would give his life to get to 
Mars. 1 thought I would in my 
time. I was positive I would when 
I knew I was in your time. And 
now I know I never will."* 

THE cot creaked beside him 
and he felt a soft arm about 
his shoulders and fingers delicately stroking his brow. Presently he opened his eyes and 
looked at her. "I just don't understand," he said. "It seemed 
obvious to me that whenever men 
were able to reach the planets, 
they'd do it." 

Her pitying eyes were on his 
face. He hitched himself around 
so that he was facing her. "I've 
got to understand. I've got to 
know why. What happened? Why 
don't men want the planets any 
more?" 



"Honestly," she said, "I did not 
know they ever had.", She hesitated. "Maybe you are asking the 
wrong question." 

He furrowed his brow, bewildered now by her. 

"I mean," she explained, "maybe you should ask why people 
in the 20th Century did want to 
go to worlds men are not suited 
to inhabit." 

Maitland felt his face become 
hot. "Men can go anywhere, if 
they want to bad enough." 

"But why?" 

Despite his sudden irrational 
anger toward her, Maitland tried 
to stick to logic. "Living space, 
for one thing. The only permanent solution to the population 
problem . . ." 

"We have no population problem. A hundred years ago, we 
realized that the key to social stability is a limited population. Our 
economic system was built to take 
care of three hundred million 
people, and we have held the 
number at that." 

"Birth control," Maitland scoffed. "How do you make it work 
— secret police?" 

"No. Education. Each of us has 
the right to two children, and we 
cherish that right so much that 
we make every effort to see that 
those two are the best children 
we could possibly produce . . .** 

She broke off, looking a little 
self-conscious. "You understand, 




 



what I have been saying applies 
to most of the world. In some 
places like Aresund, things are 
different. Backward. I still do not 
feel that I belong here, although 
the people of the town have accepted me as one of them," 

"Even," he said, "granting that 
you have solved the population 
problem, there's still the adventure of the thing. Surely, somewhere, there must be men who 
still feel that . . . Ingrid, doesn't it 
fire something in your blood, the 
idea of going to Mars — just to 
go there and see what's there and 
walk under a new sky and a 
smaller Sun? Aren't you interested in finding out what the 
canals are? Or what's under the 
clouds of Venus? Wouldn't you 
like to see the rings of Saturn 
from a distance of only two hundred thousand miles?" His hands 
were trembling as he stopped. 

She shrugged her shapely 
shoulders. "Go into the past — 
yes! But go out there? I still cannot see why." 

"Has the spirit of adventure 
evaporated from the human race, 
or what?" 

She smiled. "In a room downstairs there is the head of a lion. 
Swarts killed the beast when he 
was a young man. He used a 
spear. And time traveling is the 
greatest adventure there is. At 
least, that is rhe way I feel. 
Listen, Bob." She laid a hand on 



his arm. "You grew up In the 
Age of Technology. Everybody 
was terribly excited about what 
could be done with machinesmachines to blow up a city all at 
once, or fly around the world, or 
take a man to Mars. We have had 
our fill of — what is the word?— 
gadgets. Our machines serve us, 
and so long as they function right, 
we are satisfied to forget about 
them. 

"Because this is the Age of 
Man. We are terribly interested in 
what can be done with people. 
Our scientists, like Swarts, are 
studying human rather than nuclear reactions. We are much more 
fascinated by the life and death of 
cultures than by the expansion 
or contraction of the Universe. 
With us, it is the people that are 
important, not gadgets." 

Maitland stared at her, his face 
blank. His mind had just manufactured a discouraging analogy. 
His present position was like that 
of an earnest 12th Century crusader, deposited by some freak of 
nature into the year 1950, trying 
to find a way of reanimating the 
ant i -Mohammedan mo vem ent. 
What chance would he have? The 
unfortunate knight would argue 
in vain that the atomic bomb offered a means of finally destroying the infidel . . . 

Maitland looked up at the girl, 
who was regarding him silently 
with troubled eyes. *'I think I'd 



AMBITION 



like to be alone for a while,** he 
said. 

IN the morning, Maitland was 
tired, though not particularly 
depressed. He hadn't slept much, 
but he had come to a decision. 
When Ingrid woke him, he gave 
her a cavalier smile and a cheery 
"Good morning" and sat down to 
the eggs and ham' she had 
brought. Then, before she could 
leave, he asked, "Last night when 
we were talking about spaceships, 
you mentioned some kind of vessel or vehicle. What was it?" 

She thought. "VHegvlotter? 
Was that it?" 

He nodded emphatically. "Tell 
me about them." 

"Well, they are ■ — cars, you 
might say, with wheels that go 
into the body when you take off. 
They can do, oh, 5,000 miles an 
hour in the ionosphere, 50 miles 
Up." 

"Fifty miles," Maitland mused. 
"Then they're sealed tight, so the 
sir doesn't leak out?" Ingrid nodded. "How do they work? Rocket 
drive?" 

"No." She plucked at her lower 
lip. "I do not understand it very 
well. You could picture something that hooks into a gravity 
field, and pulls. A long way from 
the Earth it. would not work very 
well, because the field is so thin 
there . . . I guess I just cannot 



explain it very well to you." 

"That's all I need." Maitland 
licked bis lips and frowned. "On 
that point, anyway. Another thing 
— Swarts told me I'd be here for 
about a week. Is there any set 
procedure involved in that? Have 
""other persons been brought to this 
period from the past?" 

She laughed. "Thousands. 
Swarts has published nearly a 
hundred case studies himself, and 
spent time adding up to years in 
the 19th and 20th centuries." 

Maitland interrupted incredulously. "How on Earth could he 
ever manage to keep that many 
disappearances quiet? Some of 
those people would be bound to 
talk." 

She shook her head definitely. 
"The technique was designed to 
avoid just that. There is a method 
of 'fading' the memories people 
have of their stay here. The episode is always accepted as a 
period of amnesia, in the absence 
of a better explanation." 

"Still, in thousands of cases..." 

"Spread out over centuries in 
a total population of billions." 

He laughed. "You're right. But 
will that be done to me?" 

"I suppose so. I can't imagine 
Swarts letting you take your 
memories back with you," 

Maitland looked out the window at the green horizon. "We'll 
see," he said.

MAITLAND removed his 
three-day beard with an effective depilatory cream he discovered in the bathroom, and settled down to wait. When Swarts 
arrived, the engineer said quietly, 
"Sit down, please. I have to talk 
with you." 

Swarts gave him the look of a 
man with a piece of equipment 
that just won't function right, and 
remained standing. "What is it 
now?" 

"Look," Maitland said, "Ingrid 
has told me that men never 
reached the planets. You ought to 
know how I feel about space 
flight. It's my whole life. Knowing 
that my work on rockets is going 
to pay off only in the delivery of 
bombs, I don't want to go back 
to the 20th Century. I want to 
stay here." 

Swarts said slowly, "That's impossible." 

"Now, look, if you want me to 
cooperate ..." 

The big man made an impatient gesture. "Not impossible because of me. Physically impossible. Impossible because of the 
way time travel works." 

Maitland stared at him suspiciously. 

"To displace a mass from its 
proper time takes energy," Swarts 
explained, "and it's one of the 
oldest general physical principles 
that higher energy states are unstable with respect to lower ones. 



Are you familiar with elementary 
quantum theory? As an analogy, 
you might regard yourself, displaced from your proper time, as 
an atom in an excited state. The 
system is bound to drop back to 
ground state. In the atomic case, 
the time which elapses before that 
transition occurs is a matter of 
probabilities. In the case of time 
travel, it just depends on the 
amount of mass and the number 
of years the mass is displaced. 

"In short, the laws of nature 
will insist on your returning to 
1950 in just a few days." 

Maitland looked at the floor for 
a while, and his shoulders sagged. 
"Your memories of this will be 
faded," Swarts said. "You'll forget about what Ingrid has told 
you — forget you were ever here, 
and take up your life where you 
left off. You were happy working 
on rockets, weren't you?" 

"But — " Maitland shook his 
head despairingly. Then he had 
an idea. "Will you let me do one 
thing, before I go back? I realize 
now that our time is limited, and 
you have a lot of tests to give me, 
but I'm willing to help speed 
things up. I want to see the stars, 
just once, from deep space. I 
know you'll make me forget it 
ever happened, but once in my 
life . . . You have vessels — vliegvlotter, Ingrid called them — that 
can go into space. If you'd give 
me just a couple days to go .out

there, maybe circle the Moon...?" 
There was a pleading note in his 
voice, but he didn't care. 

Swarts regarded him dispassionately for a mom ent, then 
nodded. "Sure," he said. "Now 
let's get to work." 

'TT^HE Earth doesn't change 
much," Maitland mused. 
Sitting on iftte cot, his arm around 
Ingrid's yielding waist, he was 
wearing the new blue trunks she 
had given him to replace his 
rumpled pajamas. The room was 
full of evening sunlight, and in 
that illumination she was more 
beautiful than any other woman 
he could remember. This had 
been the last day of tests; tomorrow, Swarts had promised, he 
would begin his heart -breakingly 
brief argosy to the Moon, with 
Ingrid as pilot. 

Over the past four days, he had 
been with the girl a lot. In the 
beginning, he realized, she had 
been drawn to him as a symbol of 
an era she longed, but was unable, 
to visit. Now she understood him 
better, knew more about him — 
and Maitland felt that now she 
liked him for himself. 

She had told him of her childhood in backward Aresund and 
of loneliness here at the school in 
Nebraska. "Here," she had said, 
"parents spend most of their time 
raising their children; at home, 
they just let us grow. Every time 



one of these people looks at me I 
feel inferior." 

She had confided her dream of 
visiting far times and places, then 
had finished, "I doubt that Swarts 
will ever let me go back. He 
thinks I am too irresponsible. 
Probably he is right. But it is terribly discouraging. Sometimes I 
think the best thing for me would 
be to go home to the fiord . . ." 

Now, sitting in the sunset glow, 
Maitland was in a philosophic 
mood. "The color of grass, the 
twilight, the seasons, the stars — 
those things haven't changed." He 
gestured out the window at the 
slumbering evening prairie. "That 
scene, save for unessentials, could 
just as well be 1950 — or 950. It's 
only human institutions that 
change rapidly . . 

"I'll be awfully sorry when you 
go back,*' she sighed. "You're the 
first person I've met here that I 
can talk to." 

"Talk to," he repeated, dissatisfied. "You're just about the 
finest girl I've ever met." 

He kissed her, playfully, but 
when they separated there was 
nothing playful left about it. Her 
face was flushed and he was 
breathing faster than he had been. 
Savagely, he bit the inside of his 
cheek. "Two days! A lifetime here 
wouldn't be long enough!" 

"Bob." She touched his arm and 
her lips were trembling. "Bob, do 
you have to go — out there? We 
could get a couple of horses tomorrow, and we would have two 
days." 

He leaned back and shook his 
liead. "Can't you see, Ingrid? This 
is my only chance. If I don't go 
tomorrow, I'll never get to the 
Moon. And then my whole life 
won't mean anything . . ." 

HE woke with Ingrid shaking 
him. "Bob! Bob!" Her voice 
was an urgent whisper. "You've 
got to wake up quick! Bob!" 

He sat up and brushed the hair 
out of his eyes. "What's the matter?" 

"I didn't really believe that 
Swarts would let you go into 
space. It wasn't like him. Bob, he 
fooled you. Today is when your 
time runs out!" 

Maitland swallowed hard, and 
his chest muscles tightened convulsively. "You mean it was all a 
trick?" 

She nodded. "He told me just 
now, while he was putting something in your milk to make you 
sleep." Her face was bitter and resentful. "He said, 'This is a lesson 
for you, Ching, if you ever do any 
work with individuals like this. 
You have to humor them, tell 
them anything they want to believe, in order to get your data.' " 

Maitland put his feet on the 
floor, stood up. His face was white 
and he was breathing fast. 

She grasped his arm. "What 

72 




 



are you going to do?" 

He shook her hand off. "I may 
not get to the Moon, but I'm going to teach one superman the 
advantage of honesty!" 

"Wait! That won't get you 
anywhere." 

"He may be bigger than I am," 
Maitland gritted, "but — " 

She squeezed his arm violently. 
"You don't understand. He would 
not fight you. He'd use a gun." 

"If I could catch him by surprise . . ." 

She took hold of his shoulders 
firmly. "Now, listen, Bob Maitland. I love you. And I think it's 
the most important thing in the 
world that you get to see the 
stars. Swarts will never let me 
time travel, anyway." 

"What are you thinking?" 

"I'll go down to the village and 
get a vlie/gvlotter. It won't take 
twenty minutes. I'll come back, 
see that Swarts is out of the way, 
let you out of here, and take 
you—" she hesitated, but her eyes 
were steady — "wherever you want 
to go." 

He was trembling. "Your career. I can't let you . . ." 

She made as if to spit, then 
grinned. "My career! It's time I 
went home to the fiord, anyway. 
Now you wait here!" 

rriHE vliegvlotter was about 50 
feet long, an ellipsoid of revolution. Maitland and Irigrid ran 



hand in hand across the lawn and 
she pushed him up through the 
door, then slammed it shut and 
screwed the pressure locks tight. 

They were strapping themselves into the seats, bathed in 
sunlight that flooded down 
through the thick plastic canopy, 
when she stopped, pale with consternation. 

"What the matter?" he demanded. 

"Oh, Bob, I forgot! We can't 
do this!" 

"We're going to," he said 
grimly. 

"Bob, sometime this morning 
you're going to snap back to 1950. 
If that happens while we're up 
there . . ." 

His jaw went slack as the implication soaked in. Then he 
reached over and finished fastening the buckle on her wide seat 
belt. 

"Bob, I can't. I would be killing 
you just as surely as . . ." 

"Never mind that. You can tell 
me how to run this thing and then 
get out, if you want to." 

She reached slowly forward and 
threw a switch, took hold of the 
wheel. Seconds later they were 
plummeting into the blue dome 
of the sky. 

The blue became darker, purplish, and stars appeared in daylight. Maitland gripped the edge 
of the seat; somewhere inside him 
it seemed that a chorus of angels 



AMBITION 



73* 



was singing the finale of Beethoven's Ninth. 

There was a ping and Ingrid 
automatically flicked a switch. A 
screen lit up and the image of 
Swarts was looking at them. His 
eyes betrayed some unfamiliar 
emotion, awe or fear. "Ching! 
Come back here at once. Don't 
you realize that — " 

"Sorry, Swarts." Maitland's 
voice resonated with triumph. 
"You'll just have to humor me 
once more." 

"Maitland! Don't you know 
that you're going to snap back 
to the 20th Century in half an 
hour? You'll be in space with no 
protection. You'll explode!" 

"I know," Maitland said. He 
looked up through the viewport. 
"Right now, I'm seeing the stars 
as I've never seen them before. 
Sorry to make you lose a case, 
Swarts, but this is better than dying of pneumonia or an atomic 
bomb." 

He reached forward and snapped the image off. 

TWENTY minutes later, Maitland had Ingrid cut the drive 
and turn the ship, so that he 
could see the Earth. It was there, 
a huge shining globe against the 
constellations, 10,000 miles distant, 100 times the size of familiar 
Luna. North America was directly below, part of Canada covered with a dazzling area of 



clouds. The polar ice-cap was 
visible in its entirety, along with 
the northern portions of the Eurasian land mass. The line of darkness cut off part of Alaska and 
bisected the Pacific Ocean, and 
the Sun's reflection in the Atlantic was blinding. 

And there was Venus, a brilliant white jewel against the 
starry blackness of interstellar 
space, and now he could see the 
Sun's corona . . . 

The ship was rotating slowly, 
and presently the Moon, at first 
quarter, came into view, not perceptibly larger than seen from' 
Earth. Maitland heaved a sigh 
of regret. If only this could have 
been but the beginning of a voyage . . . 

Ingrid touched his arm. "Bob." 
He turned to look at her golden 
beauty. 

"Bob, give me one more kiss." 

He loosened his seat strap and 
put his arms around her. For a 
moment he felt her soft hps on 
his . . . 

Then she was gone, and the 
srrtp had vanished. For perhaps 
as long as a second, alone in 
space, he was looking with naked, 
unprotected, ambition -sated eyes 
at the distant stars. 

The luring white blaze of 
Venus was the last image he took 
with him into the night without 
stars.
