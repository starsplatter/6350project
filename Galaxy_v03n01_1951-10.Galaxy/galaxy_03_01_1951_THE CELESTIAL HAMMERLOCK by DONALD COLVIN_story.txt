wish to leave the employment 
of the Interplanetary Amusement 
Corp. Under our employee policy, 
this is allowable, effective upon 
completion of your current assignmmt. Under precedent set as 
long ago as 2347 A. D. the company will even pay the cost of 
your message of resignation. 

However, the words "you balloon brain" do not seem a necessary part of that message and will 
be deducted from your salary. 

Furthermore, I have a few 
words of my own to say You 
march straight into my office, 
Michaels, just as soon as you get 
back from Eros. Eros? what in 

HELL ARE YOU DOING ON EROS?

Mr. H. E. Horrocks 
Dear Balloon Brain : 

If you paid a little more attention to your office and less to that 
golf course on Venus, you'd know 
what I am doing on Eros. I got 
here two days ago via Mars with 
a herd of six wrestlers, in accordance with your own written 
memorandum. We were to appear 
at an Auruchs club smoker. 

Upon arrival, I found that no 
preparations had been made (or 
us and nobody knows anything 
about an Auruchs club. 

The people here are nuts. They 



talk in six syllable words and 
their idea of a good time is to 
sniff flowers and do five dimensional calculus. They have less 
use for wrestlers than I have for 
you.

Michaels, you nitwit: 

That wasn't £ros, you idiot! 
You were supposed to go to Erie 
— Erie, Pa., right here on Earth! 

If you remembered even your 
sixth grade Solar System history, 
you would know that the planetoid Eros was settled in 2141 by 
a group of longhairs headed by 
Prof: M. R. Snock, a philosopher 
With a dozen university degrees. 

He wanted to show that war, 
crime and all forms of violence 
would disappear if people thought 
only beautiful thoughts. 

The planetoid is lousy rich with 
erydnium ore and the people keep 
in luxury selling it to space 
freighters. They spend their time 
being gentle and thinking beautiful. There hasn't even been a 
spitball thrown there in eight 
generations. 

A fine place for you to show up 
mahouting six wrestlers with no 
foreheads. You're lucky they 
haven't thrown you in jail.

Mr. H. E. Horrocks 
Dear Jellyhead: 

What do you mean lucky? We 
are in jail. 

Right after we got here, the 
boys decided they had been 
cramped in that local spaceship 
and needed a workout to limber 
up. As soon as they got started, 
they were surrounded by a bunch 
of scrawny males, all sniffing hollyhocks. 

Their spokesman, a bald bird 
with rosebuds in his whiskers, 
touched me with a gold-headed 
cane and said that apparently we 
were not yet attuned to the high 
mental plane of the planetoid, 
and would we mind going into 
protective custody while they 
worked over our egos and cured 
our kineticism. 

I said suppose we wouldn't. He 
looked shocked and waved his 
flower and said that then, although it had never happened 
before, he supposed he would 
have to call the space patrol and 
have us thrown into the hoosegow on, Ganymede. 

I translated that into basic 
wrestler for the boys and we 
agreed we'd better go along. We'd 
heard about the jail those tough 
space patrol babies operate on 
Ganymede. 

The flower lovers took us to an 
old erydnium pit and asked us to 



please go down. Now they're perfuming us every hour and feeding 
us flower bulbs to make us gentle. 

We could climb out of this rathole whenever we wanted, but 
that would be climbing straight 
into a striped spacesuit. 

I think about you all the time. 
And if you think they're beautiful 
thoughts, you're as crazy as I've 
always suspected. 

Michaels 
P.S. The boys asked that I enclose this note from them: 
Dear Mr. Horox : 

We do not like it here Mr.

Mr. H. E. Hbrrocks 

My dear employer and pal: 

Eros is a wonderful asteroid! 

Toward the end of the second 
day in the pit, the wrestlers limbered up. Zbich and the Gorilla 
Man worked out on headlocks. 
Gorgeous Gordon did calisthenics, 
and Barefoot Charley, Choker 
Jonas and the Faceless Wonder 
got themselves into a grunting 
free-for-all. 

After that got under way, I 
beard a squeal and a girl came 
bounding down the pit side. She 
was young and dark -haired and 



pretty. She might have been as 
intellectual as the president of 
Harvard above the shoulders, but 
what a framework she had to 
hold up that brain! 

She went over to Gorgeous 
Gordon and she said, "Ooh!" 
With all the flower lovers around 
here, it was probably the first 
man with muscles she had ever 
seen. 

The big ham swelled up. He 
flexed his arms and stuck out his 
chest. *'OOH!" said the girl, and 
went bounding back up the side 
of the pit. 

I stopped the exercise and the 
wrestlers sat and mused blankly 
at each other. 

In a few minutes, our little 
visitor was back again. With her 
were about a dozen pals, differing 
in details, but resembling her in 
the important points. 

The leader was a tall, brownhatred, gray- eyed girt, with a 
face where intellect fought a losing battle with a dimple. The 
others helped her down the pit 
side as if she were something 
fragile and precious, like maybe a 
new bottle of perfume. 

Then our pal went back to Gorgeous Gordon. "More ooh!" said 
the girl guide. 

You know how wrestlers are. 
They'll slap each other silly to get 
the cheers of four kids on a street 
corner, or commit mayhem for a 
purse big enough to buy a ham

hock. In five seconds, we had going one of the finest wrestling 
matches in the history of good, 
clean sportsmanship. And over 
the cracking of wrestler's bones 
rose the shrieks of the girls, showing that their throats were in the 
right place, even if their brains 
weren't. 

The gray-eyed girl sat with me 
on a flange of unmined ore. She 
was Aliana. a direct descendant of 
the leader of the Eros pioneers. 
As such, she was princess of the 
planetoid, although she left most 
of the governing to a council of 
elders, apparently as outstanding 
an array of mossbacks as ever 
smelted a gardenia or just plain 
smelled. 

"I sometimes think, Mr. Michaels," Aliana told me, "that we of 
Eros have laid too much stress 
upon the cerebral. I wonder if our 
lives would not be fuller if we 
also included some of the more 
vigorous activities, such as the 
one in which those men are now 
engaged." 

"If it's a vacation for your mind 
that you want, Princess." I 
agreed, "those boys are your 
meat." 

Just then the Gorilla Man got 
a leg split on Barefoot Charley 
and began to braid his toes. 

"How stimulating," breathed 
Aliana. "What is proper for the 
onlooker to remark in such a situation?" 



"A satisfactory outcry. Princess," I explained, "is, "Break it 
off!"* 

"Break it off!" encouraged Aliana. 

I had to wind it up, finally, before the wrestlers reduced themselves to blubber, thereby forcing 
the Interplanetary Amusement 
Corp. to go out and lasso itself 
another herd. 

The girls went giggling up the 
side of the pit. At the top, Aliana 
waved at me. The others blew 
kisses, not caring much where 
they landed, as long as the receiver had muscles. 

Next morning, a young man 
came into the pit. He announced 
that, upon Princes Aliana's orders, we were to have the freedom 
of Eros, so that contact with the 
planetoid culture could win us 
from our uncouth ways. 

He was too young to be wholly 
gentled by the flowers and the 
council of elders. So the Choker 
showed him a wristlock. And 
when the Choker tossed him on 
his ear in the erydnium ore, he 
said words that were not beautiful. Maybe there's something to 
the people of this asteroid. 

Anyway, everything is great 
now. We wander wherever we 
please, as long as we return to the 
pit to sleep. When nobody is looking, we sneak into the royal palace 
courtyard and put on a wrestling 
show for the girls.

ROCKET MAIL 

(Free, Royal Frank) 

Royal Palace, Eros 
To: H. E. Horrocks, Cosmopolis, 
Earth 

Dear melon brain: 

I gather from your last message 
that you wish to discharge me. I 
accept the offer, fat boy. In fact, 
under royal Eros precedent, which 
I made up three minutes ago, we 
will even pay for your message. 
However, the words "you blundering baboon" do not seem a 
necessary part of that message, 
and their cost will be taken out 
of the first bit of business that the 
royal house of Eros decides to 
honor your puny little corporation with. 

If any. 

Times are changed, Hankus. 
I'm a big shot now. 

A few hours after we got back 
in the pit, Aliana came back and 
sneaked down to see us. She said 
she thought it was about time to 
end this council of elders' nonsense and she asked our help. 

I told her plan to the wrestlers 
in words of one syllable or less. 
They all agreed except the Faceless Wonder. 

"I don't see why I should have 
nothing to do with no book," he 
said. It seems he had had a book 
once and chewed up the first three 




 



chapters before he found out it 
wasn't something to eat. 

I signaled to the boys. Zbich 
clamped a headlock on him. The 
Choker got a hammerlock. The 
Gorilla Man took him in a scissors. Gorgeous Gordon got a toehold and Barefoot Charley stood 
by to jump on his stomach. 

"Do you understand now?" I 
asked politely. 

"Sure, Jed, sure," said the Faceless Wonder. "Why didn't ya explain it to me in the first place?" 

So the next morning, we yelled 
for books. And for the following 
days, whenever anybody was 
around, we were busy sniffing 
flowers and reading. Between 
times, I tried to explain to the 
wrestlers why there weren't more 
pictures in the books. 

A week later, we sprang the 
trap. I told the stablehand who 
brought us our fodder that I had 
taken in so much culture that I 
was breathing beauty. Zbich, gagging a little, asked for a second 
helping of flower roots. Gorgeous 
Gordon requested a needle and 
thread; he said he had fallen behind in his needlepoint. 

A report of the conversation got 
to the council of elders and it 
brought them to the lip of the pit, 
looking like something the glue 
factory had refused to accept. 
Aliana was with them. 

I bowed from the waist and 
made a speech. I thanked the 



elders for showing me the error of 
my ways. I said that, after staying 
in the lovely erydnium pit, I was 
enraptured with flowers, crazy 
about culture and practically engaged in five dimension calculus. 
I asked that I and the boys could 
have the priceless boon of walking 
freely around Eros, swapping 
beautiful thoughts with the local 
yokels. 

The elders went into a deep 
state of flutter. Most of the m 
were for accepting our proposition out of hand — which was bad. 
Our old pal with the beard saved 
us. 

"But I saw these men romping," he shrilled. He lowered his 
voice to a high alto. "Positively 
romping!" 

"Perhaps these men could 
prove their sincerity," Aliana 
said, winking at me. "Perhaps 
one of them would consent, to 
illustrate what he has learned here 
by giving a public talk on some 
scientific subject." 

"I should be glad," I answered, 
"to hack off a lecture for the good 
folk of Eros. Suppose I give it on 
anatomy." 

And so it was decided. 

Exactly as we had planned. 

There was an amphitheater 
which the inhabitants of Eros had 
been using for ballets, string quartets and lectures by such of the 
longhairs as got stuffed so full of 
long words that they couldn't 



THE CELESTIAL HAMMERLOCK

keep them to themselves. I had 
ringposts and ropes set up on the 
platform, saying I needed them 
to illustrate my talk. I got into 
the ring with Gorgeous Gordon 
and Zbich, who were dressed in 
trunks and bathrobes. 

The wit and beauty of Eros 
was assembled there, the beauty 
being represented by the girls, 
and the wit — such as it was — by 
the council of elders. The rest of 
the seats were filled with other 
forms, some of them tolerably 
easy to look at. 

I had picked out the subject 
of anatomy in the belief that none 
of the inhabitants of Eros knew 
anything about it. 

The men didn't notice and the 
women had nothing at all to 
look at, anyway. 

I went into my act. 

"Kind hosts, friends and unfortunate incidents," I said. "My 
topic is the science of anatomy. 
Now, the science of anatomy is 
copacetic to the point of mopery. 
The cerebellum is distended and 
the duodenum goes into a state 
of e pluribus unum. Incalculably, 
thrombosis registers and the ectoplasm becomes elliptic. Or, in the 
vernacular, the eight ball in the 
side pocket." 

The crowd sat stunned. Here 
and there, a flower sniffer looked 
down at his own rack of bones to 
check my statement. 



"Let me illustrate," I said. 
I drew the bathrobes off the 
wrestlers. 

The boys' muscles rippled as 
thty strutted around the ring. 
From the women spectators came 
a long, deep sigh. From that moment, we had half the audience 
with us — the female half. 

"In anatomy," I said, shaking 
my finger to emphasize the point, 
"the wingback shifts outward for 
a lateral. In the words of the 
great philosopher Hypocritus. the 
coil should always be kept clean 
between the barrel and the tap 
and all excess collar should be 
removed with a spatula." 

Nobody was listening to me; 
they were looking at the wrestlers, 
which, of course, was what I'd 
figured on. Most of the men 
were comparing the grunters' 
muscles to their own, and here 
and there a few were dropping 
their flowers onto the floor. 

I signaled and in a second the 
boys were an omelet of flying legs. 
The crowd gasped, then leaned 
forward intently. The shrieking 
began when Gordon got a headlock on Zbich. It grew when 
Zbich flipped Gorgeous with a 
flying mare. By the time Gordon 
got in a billygoat butt, the amphitheater sounded like feeding time 
at the zoo. 

But there was another sound, 
too. Old Whiskers was tottering 
down the aisle, shrieking, "This 




 



is romping! Mere romping!" 

I signaled and the boys stopped. 

"We need a third man to illustrate the next point," I said. 
''Perhaps the gentleman in the 
aisle will volunteer." 

Two wrestlers grabbed Old 
Whiskers and tossed him into the 
ring. Making fast double talk, I 
took off his shirt and he stood 
there, stripped to the waist, blinking in the sun and looking like 
a dehydrated squab. 

The crowd noted the contrast 
between his scrawniness and the 
muscles of the wrestlers. A roar 
of laughter swept it. 

"Perhaps/' I said, "the gentleman would like to romp."' 

Zbich made a grab for him and 
he scuttled out of the ring, falling over the lower rope. A woman 
in the first row slugged him with 
a gardenia. 

"Sit down, you old fool!" She 
turned to the wrestlers. "Break 
it off!" she shouted. 

The match went on. 

In my career, including my 
medicine show days, I've had lots 
of easy marks, but nothing to 
compare to the crowd at Eros* 
first wrestling match. When Gorgeous took the first fait with a 
body scissors, they went mad; 
when Zbich evened it up, they 
went hysterical; when Zbich took 
the deciding fall, they were delirious. And at the end of the 



match between Choker Jonas and 
the Faceless Wonder, they were 
reduced to a jelly. We had to 
call off the third match for fear 
we would have to take them home 
in jars. 

At the end, we went in a body, 
led by the wrestlers, and threw 
the council of elders into the 
erydnium pit. We are keeping 
them now on a diet of raw meat. 

The amphitheater has been 
converted into a permanent wrestling arena. We've laid out a 
football and a baseball field in 
the lyceum grove, and next week 
we'll start turning the botanical 
garden into a golf course. 

To carry out the full program, 
we shall have to buy some equipment and hire some talent. 
Whether we toss some of the business to Interplanetary depends, 
Hankus boy, entirely on what attitude Interplanetary takes toward you know who. 

When you write your crawling 
letter, you worm, address me as 
"Your Mightiness." I am minister 
of athletics on Eros now and the 
second most important person on 
the planetoid. 

My work takes me close to the 
Princess Aliana. Very close. 

Come to think of it, I wish 
there was a moon on Eros. It's 
not essential, but it helps. 

So long, peasant.
