SPACEMEN DIE AT HOME By EDWARD W. LUDWIG 


FORTY days of heaven and stars? And yet, at the same time, 

forty nights of hell. That's to be filled with a terrible, gnaw
the way it's been, Laura, ing fear — a fear locked in my 

But how can I make you under- mind during the day and bursting 

stand? How can I tell you what out like an evil jack-in-the-box 

it's like to be young and a man at night. I must tell you, Laura, 

and to dream of reaching the Perhaps if I start at the beginning, the very beginning . . . 

It was the Big Day. Al! the 
examinations, the physicals and 
psychos, were over. The Academy, 
with its great halls and classrooms 
and laboratories, lay hollow and 
silent, an exhausted thing at sleep 
after spawning its first-born. 

For it was June in this year of 
1995, and we were the graduating 
class of the U. S. Academy of Interplanetary Flight. 

The Grst graduating class, 
Laura'. That's why it was so important, because we were the first. 

We sat on a little platform, 
twenty-five of us. Below us was 
a beach of faces, most of them 
strange, shining like pebbles in 
the warm New Mexican sunlight. 
They were the faces of mothers 
and fathers and grandparents and 
kid brothers and sisters — the people who a short time ago had been 
only scrawled names on letters 
from home or words spoken wistfully at Christmas. They were the 
memory -people who, to me, had 
never really existed. 

But today they had become 
real, and they were here and 
looking at us with pride in their 
eyes. 

A voice was speaking, deep, 
sure, resonant. ". . . these boys 
have worked hard for six years, 
and now they're going to do a 
lot of big things. They're going to 
bring us the metals and minerals 
that we desperately need. They're 



going to find new land for our 
colonists, good rich land that will 
bear food and be a home for our 
children. And perhaps most important of all, they'll make other 
men think of the stars and look 
up at them and feel humility — 
for mankind needs humility." 

The speaker was Robert 
Chandler, who'd brought the first 
rocket down on Mars just five 
years ago, who'd established the 
first colony there, and who had 
just returned from his second hop 
to Venus. 

Instead of listening to his 
words, I was staring at his broad 
shoulders and his dark, crew-cut 
hair and his white uniform which 
was silk-smooth and skin-tight. 
I was worshiping him and hating 
him at the same time, for I was 
thinking: 

He's already reached Mars and 
Venus. Let him leave Jupiter and 
the others alone! Let us be the 
first to land somewhere! Let us 
be the first! 

1V/|ICKEY Cameron, sitting next 
to me, dug an elbow into my 
ribs. "I don't see 'era, Ben." he 
whispered. "Where do you suppose they are?" 

I blinked. "Who?" 

"My folks." 

That was something I didn't 
have to worry about. My parents 
had died in a strato-jet crash 
when I was four, so I hadn't

needed many of those "You are 
cordially invited" cards. Just one, 
which I'd sent to Charlie Taggart. 

Stardust Charlie, we called 
him, although I never knew why. 
He was a veteran of Everson's 
first trip to the Moon nearly 
twenty-five years ago, and he was 
still at it. He was Chief Jetman 
now on the Lunar Lady, a commercial ore ship on a shuttle between Luna City and White 
Sands. 

I remembered how, as a kid, 
I'd pestered him in the Long Island Spaceport, tagging after him 
like a puppy, and how he'd grown 
to like me until he became father, 
mother, and buddy all in one to 
me. And I remembered, too, how 
his recommendation had finally 
made me a cadet. 

My gaze wandered over the 
faces, but I couldn't find 
Charlie's. It wasn't surprising. 
The Lunar Lady was in White 
Sands now, but liberties, as 
Charlie said, were as scarce as 
water on Mars. 

It doesn't matter, I told myself. 

Then Mickey stiffened. "I see 
'em, Ben! There in the fifth row!" 

Usually Mickey was the same 
whether in a furnace-hot engine 
room or a garden party, smiling, 
accepting whatever the world offend But now a tenseness and an 
excitement had gripped even him. 
I was grateful that he was beside 
me; we'd been a good team during 



those final months at the Academy and I knew we'd be a good 
team in space. The Universe was 
mighty big, but with two of us to 
face it together, it would be only 
half as big. 

And then it seemed that all the 
proud faces were looking at us as 
if we were gods. A shiver went 
through my body. Though it was 
daytime, I saw the stars in my 
mind's vision, the great shining 
balls of silver, each like a voice 
crying out and pleading to be explored, to be touched by the sons 
of Earth. 

They expect a Jot from us. 
They expect us to make a ne'w 
kind of civilization and a better 
place out of Earth. They expect 
all this and a hell of a lot more. 
They think there's nothing we 
can't do. 

I felt very small and very 
humble. I was scared. Damned 
scared. 

A T last it was over, and the 
proud faces descended upon 
us in a huge, babbling wave. 

Then I saw him. Good old 
Stardust Charlie. 

His wizened little body was 
shuffling down an aisle, his eyes 
shining like a child's. He'd been 
sandwiched, evidently, in one of 
the rear rows. 

But he wasn't the Charlie T'd 
seen a year ago. He'd become 
gaunt and old, and he walked

with an unnatural stiffness. He 
looked so old that it was hard 
to believe he'd once been young. 

He scratched his mop of steelgray hair and grinned. 

"You made it, boy," he chortled, "and by Jupiter, we'll celebrate tonight. Yes, siree, I got 
twenty-four hours, and we'll celebrate as good spacemen should!" 

Then Mickey strode up to us. 
He was his normal, boyish self 
again, walking lightly, his blond, 
curly -haired skull swaying as if 
in rhythm with some silent melody. 

And you, Laura, were with him. 

"Meet the Brat," he said. "My 
sister Laura." 

I stared almost rudely. You 
were like a doll lost in the immensity of your fluffy pink dress. 
Your hair was long and transformed into a golden froth where 
sunlight touched it. But your eyes 
were the eyes of a woman, glowing like dark stars and reflecting 
a softness, a gentleness that I'd 
never seen in eyes before. 

"I'm happy to meet you, Ben." 
you said. "I've heard of no one 
else for the past year." 

A tide of heat crept up from my 
collar. I stuttered through an introduction of Charlie. 

You ' and Mickey looked 
strangely at Charlie, and I realized that old Stardust was not a 
cadet's notion of the ideal spaceman. Charlie scorned the skin


tight uniforms of the government 
service and wore a shiny black 
suit that was a relic of Everson's 
early-day Moon Patrol. His tie 
was clumsily knotted, and a button on his coat was missing. c 

And the left side of his face 
was streaked with dark scar tissue, the result of an atomic 
blowup on one of the old Moon ' 
ships. I was so accustomed to the 
scars, I was seldom aware of 
them ; but others, I knew, would 
find them ugly. 

You were kind. You shook 
hands and said, softly: "It's a 
privilege to meet you, Charlie. 
Just think — one of Everson's men, 
one of the first to reach the 
Moon!" 

Charlie gulped helplessly, and 
Mickey said: "Still going to 
spend the weekend with us, aren't 
you, Ben?" 

I shook my head. "Charlie has 
only twenty-four hours liberty. 
We're planning to see the town 
tonight." 

"Why don't you both come 
with us?" you asked. "Our folks 
. have their own plane, so it would 
be no problem. And we've got a 
big guest room. Charlie, wouldn't 
you like a home-cooked meal before going back to the Moon?" 

Charlie's answer was obscured 
by a sudden burst of coughing. I 
knew that he'd infinitely prefer to 
spend his liberty sampling Martian fizzes and Plutonian zombies.

But this night seemed too sacred for Charlie's kind of celebration. 

"We'd really like to come," I 
said. 

d\N our way to the 'copter 
parking field. Dean Dawson 
passed us. He was a tall, willowy 
man. spectacled, looking the way 
an academy professor should 
look. 

"Ben," he called, "don't forget 
that offer. Remember you've got 
two months to decide." 

"No, thanks," I answered. "Better not count on me." 

A moment later Mickey said, 
frowning. "What was he talking 
about. Ben? Did he make you an 
offer?" 

I laughed. "He offered me a job 
here at the Academy teaching astrogation. What a life that would 
be! Imagine standing in a classroom for forty years when I've got 
the chance to—" 

I hesitated, and you supplied 
the right words: "When you've 
got the chance to be the first to 
reach a new planet. That's what 
most of you want, isn't it? That's 
what Mickey used to want." 

I looked at you as if you were 
Everson himself, because you 
seemed to understand the hunger 
that could lie in a man's heart. 

Then your last words came 
back and jabbed me : "That's 
what Mickey used to want." 



"U sed to want?" I asked. 
"What do you mean?" 

You bit your lip, not answering. 

"What did she mean, Mickey?" 

Mickey looked down at his feet. 
"I didn't want to tell you yet, 
Ben. We've been together a long 
time, planning to be on a rocket. 
But—" 

"Yes?" 

"Well, what does it add up to? 
You become a spaceman and wear 
a pretty uniform. You wade 
through the sands of Mars and 
the dust of Venus. If you're lucky, 
you're good for five, maybe ten 
years. Then one thing or another 
gets . you. They don't insure 
rocketmen, you know." 

My stomach was full of churning, biting ice. "What are you trying to say, Mickey?" 

"I've thought about it a long 
time. They want me for Cargo 
Supervisor of White Sands Port.'* 
He raised his hand to stop mg. '11 
know. It's not so exciting. I'll just 
live a lot longer. I'm sorry, Ben." 
- I couldn't answer. It was as if 
someone had whacked the back 
of my knees with the blast of a 
jet. 

"It doesn't change anything, 
Ben — right now, I mean. We can 
still have a good weekend." 

Charlie was muttering under 
his breath, smoldering like a 
bomb about to reach critical 
mass. I shook my head dazedly 
at him as we got to the 'copter.

"Sure," I said to Mickey, "we 
can still have a good weekend." 

1 LIKED your folks, Laura. 
There was no star-hunger in 
them, of course. They were simple and solid and settled, like 
green growing things, deep-rooted, belonging to Earth. They were 
content with a home that was 
cool on this warm summer night, 
with a 'copter and a tri-dimensional video, and a handsome 
automatic home that needed no 
servants or housework. 

Stardust Charlie was as comfortable as a Martian sandnionkey in a shower, but he tried 
courageously to be himself. 

At the dinner table he stared 
glassily at nothing and grated, 
"Only hit Mars once, but I'll 
never forget the kid who called 
himself a medic. Skipper started 
coughing, kept it up for three 
days. Whoopin* cough, the medic 
says, not knowin' the air had 
chemicals that turned to acid in 
your lungs. I'd never been to 
Mars before, but I knew better'n 
that. Hell, I says, that ain't 
whoopin' cough, that's lung-rot." 

That was when your father 
said he wasn't so hungry after all. 

Afterward, you and I walked 
onto the terrace, into the moonlit night, to watch for crimsontailed continental rockets that 
occasionally streaked up from 
White Sands. 



We gazed for a few seconds up 
into the dark sky, and then you 
said: "Charlie is funny, isn't he? 
He's nice and I'm glad he's here, 
but he's sort of funny." 

"He's an old-time spaceman. 
You didn't need much education 
in those days, just a lot of brawn 
and a quick mind. It took guts to 
be a spaceman then." 

"But he wasn't always a spaceman. Didn't he ever have a family?" 

I smiled and shook my head. 
"If he had, he never mentioned it. 
Charlie doesn't like to be sentimental, at least not on the outside. As far as I know, his life 
began when he took off for the 
Moon with Everson." 

You stared at me strangely, almost in a sacred kind of way. I 
knew suddenly that you liked me, 
and my heart began to beat faster. 

There was silence. 

You were lovely, your soft hair 
like strands of gold, and there 
were flecks of silver in your dark 
eyes. Somehow I was afraid. I had 
the feeling that I shouldn't have 
come here. 

You kept looking at me until 
I had to ask; "What are you 
thinking, Laura?" 

You laughed, but it was a sad, 
fearful laugh. "No, I shouldn't be 
thinking it. You'd hate me if I 
told you, and I wouldn't want 
that." 

"I could never hate you."

**It — It's about the stars," you 
said very softly. "I understand 
why you want to go to them. 
Mickey and I used to dream 
about them when we were kids. 
Of course I was a girl, so it was 
just a game to me. But once I 
dreamed of going to England. Oh, 
it was going to be so wonderful. 
I lived for months, just thinking 
about it. 

"One summer we went. I had 
fun. I saw the old buildings and 
castles, and the spaceports and 
the Channel Tube. But after it 
was over, I realized England 
wasn't so different from America. 
Places seem exciting before you 
get to them, and afterward they're 
not really." 

I frowned. "And you mean it 
might be the same with the stars? 
You think maybe I haven't 
grown up yet?" 

Anxiety darkened your features. 
"No, it'd be good to be a spaceman, to see the strange places and 
make history. But is it worth it? 
Is it worth the things you'd have 
to give up?" 

I didn't understand at first, 
and I wanted to ask, "Give up 
what?" 

Then I looked at you and the 
promise in your eyes, and I knew. 

All through the years I'd been 
walking down a single, narrow 
path. 

Government boarding school, 
the Academy, my eyes always 



upward and on the stars. 

Now I'd stumbled into a crossroads, beholding a strange new 
path that I'd never noticed before. 

You can go into space, I 
thought, and try to do as much 
living in ten years as normal men 
do in fifty. You can be like Everson, who died in a Moon crash at 
the age of 36, or like a thousand 
others who lie buried in Martian 
sand and Venusian dust. Or, if 
you're lucky, like Charlie — a kind 
of human meteor streaking 
through space, eternally alone, 
never finding a home. 

Or there's the other path. To 
stay on this little prison of an 
Earth in cool, comfortable houses. 
To be one of the solid, rooted 
people with a wife and kids. To 
be one of the people who live 
long enough to grow old, who 
awake to the song of birds instead 
of rocket grumblings, who Sit 
their lungs with the clean rich air 
of Earth instead of poisonous 
dust. 

'Tm sorry," you said. "I didn't 
mean to make you sad, Ben," 

"It's all right," I said, clenching my fists. "You made sense — a 
lot of sense." 

HPHE next morning Charlie said 
good-bye in our room. He 
rubbed his scarred face nervously 
as he cleared his throat with a 
series of thin, tight coughs. 



SPACEMEN DIE AT HOME

Then he pointed to a brown, 
faded tin box lying on the bed. 
"I'm leavin' that for you. It's full 
of old stuff, souvenirs mostly. 
Thought maybe you'd like to 
have 'em." 

I scowled, not understanding. 
"Why, Charlie? What fpr?" 

He shrugged as if afraid he 
might be accused of sentimentality. "Oh, it's just that I've been 
dodgin* meteors now for twentyfive years. That's a long time, 
boy. Ain't one spaceman in a 
thousand that lucky. Some of 
these days, I won't be so lucky." 

I tried to laugh. "You're good 
for another twenty -five years, 
Charlie." 

He shook his head stiffly, staring at nothing. "Maybe. Anyway, I'm gonna get off the Shuttle this time, make one more trip 
to Mars. Tell you what. There's 
a little stone cafe on Mars, the 
Space Rat, just off Chandler 
Field on the Grand Canal. When 
you get to Mars, take a look inside. I'll probably be there." 

He coughed again, a deep, rasping cough that filled his eyes with 
tears. 

"Not used to this Earth air," he 
muttered. "What I need's some 
Martian climate." 

Suddenly that cough frightened 
me. It didn't seem normal. I 
wondered, too, about . his stiff 
movements and glassy stare. It 
was as if he were drugged. 



I shook the thought away. If 
Charlie was sick, he wouldn't talk 
about going to Mars. The medics 
wouldn't let him go even as far as 
Luna. 

We watched him leave, you and 
Mickey and I. 

"When will you be back?" you 
asked. 

Charlie's hard face contorted 
itself into a gargoylish grin. 
"Maybe a couple of months, 
maybe a couple of years. You' 
know spacemen." 

Then he waved and strode 
away, a strange, gray, withered 
gnome of a man. 

I wanted him to say something, 
to tell me the secret that would 
kill the doubt worming through 
my brain. 

But he rounded a corner, still 
grinning and waving, and then 
he was gone. 

THAT afternoon Mickey showed me his room. It was more 
like a boy's room than a spaceman's. In it were all the little 
things that kids treasure — pennants, models of Eversons two 
ships, a tennis trophy, books, a 
home-made video. 

I began to rea 1 i 2 e h o w i mportant a room like this could be 
to a boy. I could imagine, too, the 
happiness that parents felt as they 
watched their children grow to 
adulthood. 

I'd missed something. My folks 




 



were shadow -people, my impressions of them drawn half from 
ancient photos, half from imagination. For me, it had been a 
cold, automatic kind of life, the 
life of dormitories and routines 
and rules. I'd been so blinded by 
the brilliancy of my dreams, I 
hadn't realized I was different. 

My folks were killed in a rocket 
crash. If it weren't for rockets, 
Vd have lived the kind of life a 
kid should live. 

Mickey noticed my frown. 

"What's the matter, Ben? Still 
sore? I feel like a heel, but I'm 
just not like you and Charlie, I 
guess. I — ** 

"No, I understand, Mickey. 
I'm not sore, really.'* 

"Listen, then. You haven't accepted any offer yet, have you?" 

"No. I got a couple of possibilities. Could get a berth on the 
Odyssey, the new ship being finished at Los Angeles. They want 
me, too, for the Moon Patrol, but 
that's old stuff, not much better 
than teaching. I want to be in 
deep space.** 

"Well, how about staying with 
us till you decide? Might as well 
enjoy Earth life while you can. 
Okay?" 

I felt like running from the 
house, to forget that it existed. I 
wanted someone to tell me one of 
the old stories about space, a tale 
of courage that would put fuel 
on dying dreams. 



But I wanted, also, to be with 
you, Laura, to see your smile and 
the flecks of silver in your eyes 
and the way your nose turned 
upward ever so slightly when you 
laughed. You see, I loved you already, almost as much as I loved 
the stars. 

And I said, slowly, my voice 
sounding unfamiliar and far 
away, "Sure, I'll stay, Mickey. 
Sure." 

FORTY days of joy, forty 
nights of fear and indecision. 
We did all the little things, like 
watching the rockets land at 
White Sands and frying down to 
the Gulf to swim in cool waters. 
You tried, unsuccessfully, to 
teach me to dance, and we talked 
about Everson and Charlie and 
the Moon and the stars. You felt 
you had to give the stars all the 
beauty and promise of a child's 
dream, because you knew that 
was what I wanted. 

One morning I thought, Why 
must I make a choice? Why can't 
I have both you and the. stars? 
Would that be asking too much? 

All day the thought lay in my 
mind like fire. 

That evening I asked you to 
marry me. I said it very simply: 
"Laura, I want you to be my 
wife." 

You looked up at Venus, and 
you were silent for a long while, 
your face flushed. 



SPACEMEN DIE AT HOME 



Then you murmured, "I — T 
want to marry you, Ben, but are 
you asking me to marry a spaceman or a teacher?" 

"Can't a spaceman marry, 
too?" 

"Yes, a spaceman can marry, 
but what would it be like? Don't 
'ou see, Ben? You'd be like 
Charlie. Gone for maybe two 
nonths, maybe two years. Then 
you'd have a twenty -four hour 
liberty — and I'd have what?" 

Somehow I'd expected words 
like these, but still they hurt. "I 
wouldn't have to be a spaceman 
forever. I could try it for a couple 
of years, then teach." 

"Would you, Ben? Would you 
be satisfied with just seeing Mars? 
Wouldn't you want to go on to 
Jupiter and Saturn and Uranus 
and on and on?" 

Your voice was choked, and 
even in the semi-darkness I saw 
tears glittering in your eyes. 

"Do you think I'd dare have 
children, Ben? Mickey told me 
what happened on the Cyclops. 
There was a leak in the atomic 
engines. The ship was flooded 
with radiation — just for a second. 
It didn't seem serious. The men 
had no burns. But a year later the 
captain had a child. And it 
was — " 

"I know, Laura. Don't say it." 
You had to finish. "It was a 
monster." 

That night I lay awake, the 



fears and doubts too frantic to let 
me sleep. 

You' ve got to decide now , I 
told myself, you can't stay here. 
You've got to make a choice. 

The teaching job was still open. 
The spot on the Odyssey was still 
open — and the big ship, it was 
rumored, was equipped to make it 
all the way to Pluto. 

You can take Dean Dawsons 
job and stay with Laura and 
have kids and a home and live to 
see what happens in this world 
sixty years from now. 

Or you can sre what's on the 
other side of the mountain. You 
can be a line in a history book. 

I cursed. I knew what Charlie 
would say. He'd say, "Get the 
hell out of there, boy. Don't let a 
fool woman make a sucker out of 
you. Get out there on the Odyssey 
where you belong. We goPa date 
on Mars, remember? At the Space 
Rat, just off Chandler Field on 
the Grand Canal." 

That's what he'd say. 

And yet I wanted you, Laura. 
I wanted to be with you, always. 

"Oh God," I moaned, "what 
shall I do?" 

NEXT morning the door chimes 
pealed, and you went to the 
door and brought back the audiogram. It was addressed to me; I 
wondered who could be sending 
me a message. 

I pressed the stud on the little 




 



gray cylinder, and a rasping, 
automatic voice droned : "Luna 
City, Luna, July 27, 1995. Regret 
to inform you of death of Charles 
Taggart, Chief Jetman . . 

Then there was a Latin name 
which was more polite than the 
word "lung-rot" and the metallic 
phrase, "This message brought to 
you by courtesy of United Nations Earth-Luna Communication 
Corps." 

I stood staring at the cylinder. 

Charles Taggart was dead. 

Charles Taggart was Charlie. 
Stardust Charlie, 

My heart thudded crazily 
against my chest. It couldn't be! 
Not Charlie! The audiogram, had 
lied! 

I pressed the stud again. " . , „ 
regret to inform you of death of 
Charles . . 

I hurled the cylinder at the 
wall. It thudded, fell, rolled. The 
broken voice droned on. 

You ran to it, shut it off. "I'm 
sorry, Ben, so terribly — " 

Without answering, I walked 
into my room. I knew it was true 
now. I remembered Charlie's 
coughing, his gaunt features, his 
drugged gaze. The metallic words 
had told the truth. 

I sat for a long time on my bed, 
crying inside, but staring dryeyed at Charlie's faded tin box. 

Then, finally, I fingered his 
meager possessions — a few wrinkled photos, some letters, a small 



black statue of a forgotten Martian god, a gold service medal 
from the Moon Patrol. 

This was what remained of 
Charlie after twenty-five years in 
space. It was a bitter bargain. A 
statue instead of a wife, yellowed 
letters instead of children, a 
medal instead of a home. 

It'd be a great future, I thought. 
You'd dream of sitting in a dingy 
stone dive on the Grand Canal 
with sand-wasps buzzing around 
smoky, stinking candles. A bottle 
of luchu juice and a couple of 
Martian girls with dirty feet for 
company. And a sudden cough 
that would be the first sign of 
lung-rot. 

To hell with it! 

I walked into your living room 
and called Dean Dawson on the 
visi phone. 

I accepted that job teaching. 

A ND now, Laura, it's nearly 
midnight. You're in your 
room, sleeping, and the house is 
silent. 

It's hard to tell you, to make 
you understand, and that is why 
I am writing this. 

I looked through Charlie's box 
again, more carefully this time, 
reading the old letters and studying the photographs. I believe 
now that Charlie sensed my indecision, that he left these things 
so that they could tell me what 
he could not express in words. 



SPACEMEN DIE AT HOME 



And among the things, Laura, 
I found a ring. 
A wedding ring. 
In that past he never talked 
about, there was a woman — his 
wife. Charlie was young once, his 
eyes full of dreams, and he faced 
the same decision that I am facing. Two paths were before him, 
but he tried to travel both. He 
later learned what we already 
know — that there can be no compromise. And you know, too, 
which path he finally chose. 

Do you know why he had to 
drug himself to watch me graduate? So he could look at me, 
knowing that I would see the 
worlds he could never live to see. 
Charlie didn't leave just a few 
trinkets behind him. He left himself, Laura, for he showed me that 
a boy's dream can also be a 
man's dream. 

He made his last trip to Luna 
when he knew he was going to 
die. Heaven knows how he escaped a checkup. Maybe the 
captain understood and was kind 
— but that doesn't matter now. 

Do you know why he wanted 
to reach Mars? Do you know why 
he didn't want to die in the clean, 
cool air of Earth? 

It was because he wanted to 
die nearer home. His home, 
Laura, was the Universe, where 
the ship was his house, the crew 
his father, mother, brothers, the 
planets his children. 



You say that the beauty of the 
other side of the mountain vanishes after you reach it. But how 
can one ever be sure until the 
journey is made? Could I or 
Charlie or the thousand before us 
bear to look upon a star and 
think, / might have gone there; 
1 could have been the first? 

We said, too, that the life of a 
spaceman is lonely. Yet how 
could one be lonely when men 
like Charlie roam the spaceways? 

Charlie wanted me to himself 
that night after graduation. He 
wanted us to celebrate as spacemen should, for he knew that this 
would be his last night on Earth. 
It might have seemed an ugly 
kind of celebration to you, but he 
wanted it with all his heart, and 
we robbed him of it. 

Because of these things. Laura, 
I will be gone in the morning. 
Explain the best you can to 
Mickey and to your parents and 
Dean Dawson. 

Right now I've got a date that 
I'm going to keep — at a dingy 
stone cafe on Mars, the Space 
Rat, just off Chandler Field on 
the Grand Canal. 

Stardust Charlie will be there; 
he'll go with me in memory to 
whatever part of the Galaxy I 
may live to reach. And so will 
you, Laura. 

I have two wedding rings with 
me — rhis wife's ring and yours.
