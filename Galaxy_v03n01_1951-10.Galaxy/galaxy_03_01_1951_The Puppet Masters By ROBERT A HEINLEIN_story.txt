The Puppet Masters By ROBERT A. HEINLEIN 


WHEN the doctor released me, I went looking for Mary. I still had 
only the Old Man's word, but I 
had more than a suspicion that I 
had made a big hairy sap of myself. 

You would think that a tall, 
handsome redhead would be as 
easy to find as flat ground in Kansas. Field agents come and go, 
though, and the resident staff are 
encouraged to mind their own 
business. The personnel office 
gave me the bland brushoff. They 
referred me to Operations, meaning the Old Man. It was Mary I 
wanted, not him. 

I met with even more suspicion 



102 




 



when I tried the door tally; I began to feel like a spy in my own 
section. 

I went to the bio lab, could not 
find its chief, and talked to an 
assistant. He did not know anything about a girl in connection 
with Project Interview; he went 
back to scratching himself and 
shuffling reports. I left and went 
to the Old Man's office. There 
seemed to be no choice. 

A new face was at Miss Haines' 
desk. I never saw Miss Haines 
again, nor did I ask what had become of her; I did not want to 
know. The new secretary passed 
in my I. D. code, and,, for a wonder, the Old Man was in and 
would see me. 

"What do you want?" he asked 
grumpily. 

I said, "Thought you might 
have some work for me," which 
was not at all what I had intended to say. 

"Matter of fact, I was just fixing to send for you. You've loafed 
long enough." He barked something at his desk phone, stood up 
and said, "Come!" 

I felt suddenly relaxed. "Cosmetics?" 

"Your own ugly face will do. 
We're headed for Washington." 
Nevertheless we did stop in Cosmetics, but only for street clothes, 
a gun, and to have my phone 
checked. 

The door guard made us bare 



our backs before he would let us 

approach and check out. We went 
on up, coming out in the lower 
levels of New Philadelphia. "I 
take it this burg is clean?" I said 
to the Old Man. 

"If you do, you are rusty in the 
head," he answered. "Keep your 
eyes peeled." 

The presence of so many fully 
clothed humans bothered me; I 
found myself drawing away and 
watching for round shoulders. 
Getting into a crowded elevator 
to go up to the launching platform seemed downright reckless. 
When we were in our car and the 
controls set, I said, "I could swear 
one cop we passed was wearing a 
hump." 

"Possibly. Even probably.** 

"I thought you had this job 
taped and were fighting back on 
all fronts." 

"What would you suggest?" 

"Why, it's obvious — even if it 
were freezing cold, we ought not 
to see a back covered up anywhere, not until we know the 
parasites are all dead." 

"That's right." 

"Well, then — Look, the President knows the score, doesn't he?** 
"He knows it." 

"What's he waiting for? He 
should declare martial law and 
get action." 

The Old Man stared down at 
the countryside. "It's time you 
learned the political facts of life.

Congresses have refused to act in 
the face of obvious dangers. This 
one isn't obvious. The evidence is 
slim and hard to believe," 

"But how about the Assistant 
Secretary of the Treasury? They 
can't ignore that." 

"Can't they? The honorable 
gent is in Walter Reed with a 
nervous breakdown and can't recall what happened. The Treasury Department gave out that an 
attempt to assassinate the President had been foiled — true, but 
not the way they meant it." 

"And the President held still 
for that?" 

"There are men in both Houses 
who want his head on a platter. 
Party politics is a rough game." 

"Good Lord, partisanship doesn't figure in a case like this!" 

The Old Man cocked an eyebrow. "You think not, eh?" 

I finally managed to ask him 
the question I had come into his 
office to ask: "Where is Mary?" 

"Odd question from you," he 
grunted. I let it ride; he went on, 
"Where she should be. Guarding 
the President." 

We went first to a closed session 
of a joint special committee. 
When we got there they were running stereos of my anthropoid 
friend, Napoleon — shots of him 
with the titan on his back, then 
closeups of the titan. One parasite 
looks like another, but I knew 
which one this was and I was 



deeply , glad it was dead. 

The ape gave way to me. I saw 
myself being clamped into the 
chair. I hate to admit how I looked; real funk is not pretty. I saw 
them lift the titan off the ape and 
onto my own bare back. Then I 
fainted in the picture — and almost fainted watching. 1 won't 
describe it; I can't. 

But I saw the thing die. That 
was worth sitting through the 
rest. 

The film ended and the chairman said, "Well, gentlemen?" 

"Mr. Chairman!" 

"The gentleman from Indiana 
is recognized." 

"Speaking without prejudice to 
the issue, I have seen better trick 
photography from Hollywood." 

The head of our bio lab testified, and then I found myself 
called to the stand. I gave my 
name, address, occupation, and 
perfunctorily was asked about my 
experiences under the titans. The 
questions were read from a sheet.* J& 
From the floor, one Senator said * 
to me, "Mr. Nivens — your name 
is Nivens?" I nodded. "You say 
that you are an investigator?" 

"Yes." 

"F. B. I., no doubt?" 

"No, my chief reports directly 
to the President." 

The Senator smiled. "Just as I 
thought. Now, Mr. Nivens, as a 
matter of fact you are an actor, 
are you not?" 



104 




 



I wanted to say that I had once 
acted one season of summer stock, 
but that I was, nevertheless, a 
real, live, sure-enough investigator. The next thing I knew the 
clerk was saying, "Stand down, 
Mr. Nivens." 

I sat tight. "Look here," I said. 
"It's evident that you think this 
is a put-up job. Well, for the love 
of heaven, bring in a lie detector! 
Or use the sleep test. This hearing 
is a joke." 

The chairman banged his gavel. 
"Stand down, Mr. Nivens." 

I stood. 

The Old Man had told me that 
the purpose of the meeting was to 
report out a joint resolution declaring total emergency and vesting war powers in the President. 
We were ejected before the vote. I 
said to the Old Man, "It looks 
bad." 

"Forget it,*' he said. "The President knew this gambit had failed 
when he heard the names of the 
committee." 

"Where does that leave us? Do 
we wait for the slugs to take over 
Congress, too?" 

"The President goes right ahead 
with a message to Congress requesting full powers." 

"Will he get them?" 

The Old Man simply scowled. 

HPHE joint session was secret, 
but we were present-^— direct 
orders of the President. The Old 



Man and I were on that little balcony business back of the Speaker's rostrum. They opened with 
full rigamarole and then went 
through the ceremony of notifying 
the President. He came in at once, 
escorted by the delegation. His 
guards were with him, but they 
were all our men, 

Mary was with him, too. Somebody set up a folding chair for 
her, right by the President. She 
fiddled with a notebook and 
handed papers to him, pretending 
to be a secretary. But the disguise 
ended there; she looked like Cleopatra on a warm night. 

I caught her eye and she gave 
me a long, sweet smile. I grinned 
like a collie pup until the Old 
Man dug me in the ribs. Then I 
settled back and tried to behave. 

The President made a reasoned 
explanation of the situation. It 
was as straightforward and rational as an engineering report, 
and about as moving. He put 
. aside his notes at the end. "This 
is such a strange and terrible 
emergency, so totally beyond any 
previous experience, that I must 
ask broad powers to cope with it. 
In some areas, martial law must 
be declared. Because any citizen, 
no matter how respected or loyal, 
may be the unwilling servant of 
these secret enemies, all citizens 
must face some loss of rights and 
personal dignities until this 
plague is killed. 



THE PUPP E T MASTERS 



"With utmost reluctance, I ask 
that you authorize these necessary 
steps." With that he sat down. 

You can feel a crowd. They 
were uneasy, but he did not carry 
them. The President of the Senate 
looked at the Senate majority 
leader; it had been programmed 
for him to propose the resolution. 

I don't know whether the floor 
leader shook his head or signaled, 
but he did not take the floor. 
Meanwhile the delay was awkward and there were cries of 
"Mister President!" and "Order!" 

The Senate President passed 
over several others and gave the 
floor to a member of his party — Senator Gottlieb, a wheelhorse 
who would vote for his own 
lynching if it were on his party's 
program. He started out by yielding to none in his respect for the 
Constitution, the Bill of Rights, 
and probably the Grand Canyon. 
He pointed modestly to his own 
long service and spoke well of 
America's place in history. I 
thought he was stalling while the 
boys worked out a new shift, 
when I suddenly realized that his 
words were adding up to meaning: he was proposing to suspend 
the order of business and get on 
with the impeachment and trial 
of the President of the United 
States! 

I tumbled to it as quickly as 
anyone; the Senator had his proposal so decked out In ritualistic 



verbiage that It was hard to tell 
what he was saying. I looked at 
the Old Man. 

The Old Man was looking at 
Mary. 

She was looking back at him 
with an expression of extreme 
urgency. 

The Old Man snatched a pad 
from his pocket, scrawled something, wadded it up, and threw it 
down to Mary. She caught it, read 
it, and passed it to the President. 

He was sitting, relaxed and 
easy, as if one of his oldest friends 
were not tearing his name to 
shreds and, with it, the safety of 
the Republic. He read the note, 
then glanced unhurriedly around 
at the Old Man. The Old Man 
nodded. 

The President nudged the Senate President, who banged his 
gavel. "If the Senator please!" 

Gottlieb looked startled and 
said, "I do not yield." 

"The Senator is not asked to 
yield. Because of the importance 
of what he is saying, the Senator 
is asked to come to the rostrum 
to speak." 

Gottlieb was puzzled, but he 
walked slowly toward the front 
of the House. Mary's chair 
blocked the steps up to the rostrum. Instead of getting out of 
the way, she fumbled around, 
turning and picking up the chair, 
so that she got even more in the 
way. Gottlieb stopped and she 



10* 




 



brushed against him. He caught 
her arm, as much to steady himself as her. She spoke to him and 
he to her, but no one else could 
hear the words. Finally he went 
on to the front of the rostrum. 

The Old Man was quivering 
like a dog in point. Mary looked 
up and nodded. The Old Man 
said,' "Take him!" 

I was over that rail in a flying 
leap and landed on Gottlieb's 
shoulders. I heard the Old Man 
shout, "Gloves, son! Gloves!" I 
did not stop for them. I split the 
Senator's jacket with my bare 
hands and I could see the slug 
pulsing under his shirt. I tore the 
shirt so anybody could see it. 

Six stereo cameras could not 
have recorded what happened in 
the next few seconds. I slugged 
Gottlieb to stop his thrashing. 
Mary was sitting on his legs. The 
President was standing over me 
and shouting, "There! Now you 
can all see." The Senate President 
was standing stupefied, waggling 
his gavel. Congress was a mob, 
men yelling and women screaming. Above me the Old Man was 
shouting orders to the Presidential guards. 

Between the guns of the guards 
and pounding of the gavel, some 
order was restored. The President 
started to talk. He told them that 
fortune had given them a chance 
to file past and see for themselves 
one of the titans from Saturn's 



largest moon. Without waiting for 
consent, he pointed to the front 
row and told them to come up. 

Mary stayed on the platform. 
About twenty had filed by when 
I saw Mary signal the Old Man. 
This time I was a hair ahead of 
his order. I might have had quite 
a fight if two of the boys had not 
been close by, because this one 
was young and tough, an exmarine. We laid him beside Gottlieb. 

Then it was "inspection and 
search" whether they liked it or 
not. I patted the women on the 
back as they came by and caught 
one. I thought I had caught another, but it was an embarrassing 
mistake; it was just blubber fat. 
Mary spotted two more, and then 
there was a long stretch, three 
hundred or more, with no jackpots. It was evident that some 
were hanging back. 

Eight men with guns were not 
enough — eleven, counting the Old 
Man, Mary and me. Most of the 
slugs would have gotten away if 
the Whip of the House had not 
organized help. With their assistance, we caught thirteen, ten 
alive. One of the hosts was badly 
wounded. 

XIII 

SO the President got the authority and the Old Man was 
his de facto chief of staff; at last 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



107 



we could move. The Old Man had 
a simple campaign in mind. It 
could not be the quarantine he 
had proposed when the infection 
was limited to the Des Moines 
area. Before we could fight, we 
had to locate the enemy. Government agents couldn't search two 
hundred million people; the people had to do it themselves. 



"Schedule Bareback" was to be 
the first phase of "Operation 
Parasite.' ' The idea was th at 
everybody was to peel to the 
waist and stay peeled, until all 
titans were spotted and killed.. 
Women could have halter strings; 
a parasite could not hide under 
one. . 

We whipped up a display to go 




IM 



CAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



with the stereocast speech the 
President would make to the nation. Fast work had saved seven 
of the parasites we had flushed in 
the sacred halls of Congress; they 
were alive on animal hosts. We 
could show them and the less 
grisly parts of the film taken of 
me. The President himself would 
appear in shorts, and models 



would demonstrate what the Well 
Undressed Citizen Would Wear 
This Season, including the metal 
head-and-spine armor which wai 
intended to protect a person even 
when asleep. 

We got it ready in one blackcoffee night. The smash finish wai 
to show Congress in session, discussing the emergency, and every 




man, woman, and pageboy showing a bare back. 

With twenty-eight minutes left 
until stereocast time, the President got a call from up the street. 
I was present; the Old Man had 
been with the President alt night 
and had kept me around for 
chores. We were all in shorts ; 
''Schedule Bareback" had already 
started in the White House. The 
President did not bother to cut 
us out of his end of the conversation. 

"Speaking," he said. Presently 
he added, "You feel certain? Very 
well, John, what do you advise? 
... I see. No, I don't think that 
would work ... I had better come 
up the street. Have them ready.'* 
He pushed back the phone and 
turned to an assistant. "Tell them 
to hold up the broadcast." He 
turned to the Old Man. "Come, 
we must go to the Capitol." 

He sent for his valet and retired into a dressing room adjoining his office. When he came out, 
he was formally dressed for a 
state occasion. He offered no explanation. The rest of us stayed in 
our gooseflesh specials and so we 
went to the Capitol. 

It was a joint session and I got 
that no -pants -in -church nightmare feeling, for the Congressmen and Senators were dressed as 
usual. Then I saw that the pageboys were in shorts without shirts 
and felt better. 



Apparently some people would 
rather be dead than lose dignity, 
with Congress high on the list. 
They had given the President the 
authority he asked for; "Schedule 
Bareback" itself had been discussed and approved, but they 
did not see that it applied to 
them. After all, they had been 
searched and cleaned out. Maybe 
some saw holes in the argument, 
but not one wanted to be first in 
a public striptease. They sat tight, 
fully dressed. 

When the President took the 
rostrum, he waited until he got 
dead silence. Then slowly, calmly, 
he started taking off clothes. He 
stopped when he was bare to the 
waist. He then turned around, 
lifting his arms. At last he spoke. 

"I did that," he said, "so that 
you might see that your Chief 
Executive is not a prisoner of the 
enemy." He paused, punched a 
finger at the junior Whip. "Mark 
Cummings, are you a loyal citizen or are you a zombie spy ? Get 
your shirt off!" 

"Mister President — " It was 
Charity Evans, from the State of 
Maine, looking like a pretty 
schoolteacher. She stood and I 
saw that, while she was fully 
dressed, she was in evening dress. 
Her gown reached to the floor, but 
was cut as deep as could be above. 
She turned like a mannequin; in 
back the dress ended at the base 
of her spine. "Is this satisfactory 



no 




 



attire, Mr. President?" 

"Quite satisfactory, Madam." 

Cummings was fumbling at his 
jacket; his face was scarlet. Someone stood up in the middle of the 
hall — Senator Gottlieb. He looked 
as if he should have been in bed. 
His cheeks were gray and sunken, 
his lips showed cyanosis, but he 
held himself erect and, with incredible dignity, followed the 
President's example. Then he, too, 
turned all the way around. On 
his back was the scarlet mark of 
the parasite. 

He spoke. "Last night I stood 
here and said things I would 
rather have been flayed alive than 
utter. Last night I was not my 
own master. Today I am." Suddenly he had a gun in his hand. 
'*Up on your feet! Two minutes 
to show a bare back or I shoot!" 

Men close to him tried to grab 
his arm, but he swung the gun 
around like a fly-swatter, smashing one of them in the face. I had 
my own out, ready to back his 
play, but it was not necessary. 
They could see that he was as 
dangerous as an old bull. They 
started shucking clothes like 
Doukhobors. 

One man bolted for a door; he 
was tripped. No, he was not wearing a parasite. But we did- catch 
three. After that the show went 
on the channels ten minutes late 
and Congress started the first of 
its "bareback" sessions. 



XIV 

"T OCK your doors!" 

-■^ "Close the dampers on your 
fireplaces!" 

"Never enter a dark place!" 

"Be wary of crowds!" 

"A man wearing a coat is an 
enemy — shoot him!" 

In addition to a steady barrage 
of propaganda, the country was 
being quartered and sectioned 
from the air, searching for Flying Saucers on the ground. Our 
radar screen was on full alert for 
unidentified blips. Military units, 
from airborne troops to guidedrocket stations, were ready to 
smear any that landed. 

In the uncontam mated areas 
people took off their shirts, willingly or, reluctantly, looked 
around them and found no parasites. They watched their newscasts and wondered and waited 
for the government to tell them 
that the danger was over. But 
nothing happened, and both laymen and local officials began to 
doubt the necessity of running 
around in sunbathing costumes. 

The contaminated areas? The 
reports from there were not materially different from the reports 
from other areas. 

Back in the days of radio it 
could not have happened; the 
Washington station where the 
'cast originated could have blanketed the country. But stereo-video 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



li H 



rides wave-lengths so short that 
horizon-to-horizon relay is necessary and locat channels must be 
squirted out of local stations. It's 
the price we pay for plenty of 
channels and high -resolution pictures. 

In the infected areas the slugs 
controlled the local stations; the 
people apparently never heard 
the warning. 

But in Washington, we had 
every reason to believe that they 
had heard the warning. Reports 
came back from — well, Iowa, for 
example, just like those from California. The governor of Iowa was 
one of the first to send a message 
to the President, promising full 
cooperation. There was even a 
relayed stereo of him addressing 
his constituents, bare to the waist. 
He faced the camera and I wanted to tell him to turn around. 
Then they cut to another camera 
and we had a close up of a bare 
back, while the governor's voice 
continued. We listened to it in a 
conference room off the President's office. The President had 
kept the Old Man with him, I 
tagged along, and Mary was still 
on watch. Secretary of Security 
Martinez was there as well as the 
Supreme Chief of Staff, Air Marshal Rex ton. 

The President watched the 
Vast and turned to the Old Man. 
"Well, Andrew? I thought Iowa 
was a place we would have to 



be sure to fence off." 

The Old Man grunted. "Can't 
you folks see that the titans have 
won another round?" 

"Eh?" 

"You only heard the governor; 
they let us look at his back — or 
somebody's back. Did you notice 
that he didn't turn around in front 
of the camera?" 

"But he did," someone said. "I 
saw him." 

"I certainly had the impression 
that I saw him turn," said the 
President slowly. "You are suggesting that Governor Packer is 
himself possessed?" 

"Correct. You saw what you 
were meant to see. There was a 
camera cut just before he was 
fully turned; people hardly ever 
notice them. Depend on it, Mister 
President; every message out of 
Iowa is faked." 

The President looked thoughtful. Secretary Martinez said, "Impossible! Granted that the governor's message could have been 
faked — a clever character actor 
could have faked it. But we've 
had our choice of dozens of 'casts 
from Iowa. How about that street 
scene in Des Moines? Don't tell 
me that you can fake hundreds 
of people dashing around stripped 
to their waists. Or do your parasites practice mass hypnotis?" 

"They can't that I know of," 
conceded the Old Man. "If they 
can, we might as well throw in the 



GALAXY SCIENCE FICTIOO 



towel. But what made you think 
that 'cast came from Iowa?" 

"Why. it came over the fowa 
channel." 

"It looked like any typical 
street in a downtown retail district. Never mind what city the 
announcer told you it was; what 
city was it?" 

I've got fairly close to the 
"camera eye" that detectives are 
supposed to have. I let that picture run through my mind — and 
I not only could not tell what city. 
I could not even place the part of 
the country. It could have been 
Memphis, Seattle, or Boston, or 
none of them. Most downtown 
districts in American cities are as 
standardized as barber shops. 

"You don't know." the Old 
Man went on. "I couldn't tell and 
I was looking for landmarks. The 
expla nation is simple. The Des 
Moines station picked up a 
'Schedule Bareback' street scene 
from some city not contaminated 
and rechanneled it under their 
own commentary. Gentlemen, the 
enemy knows us. This campaign 
has been planned in detail and 
they are ready to outwit us in almost any move we can make." 

"Aren't you being an alarmist, 
Andrew? 1 ' said the President. 
"There is another possibility, that 
the titans have moved somewhere 
else." 

"They are still in Iowa," the 
Old Man said flatly, "but you 



won't prove it with that thing." 
He gestured at the stereo tank. 

Secretary Martinez squirmed. 
"This is ridiculous! You are saying that we can't get a correct 
report out of Iowa, as if it were 
occupied territory." 

"That's what it is. Control the 
communications of a country and 
you control the country. You had 
better move fast, Mister Secretary, or you won't have any communications left." 

"But I was merely-—" 

The Old Man said rudely, "I've 
told you they are in Iowa and in 
New Orleans, and a dozen other 
spots. My job is finished." He 
stood up and said, "Mister President. I've had a long pull for a 
man my age; when I lose sleep. I 
lose my temper. Could I be excused?" 

"Certainly, Andrew." He had 
not lost his temper and I think 
the President knew it. He doesn't 
lose his temper; he makes other 
people lose theirs. 

Secretary Martinez interrupted. 
"Wait a moment! You've made 
some flat statements. Let's check 
up." He turned to the Chief of 
Staff. "Rexton!" 

"Yes, sir." 

"That new post near Des 
Moines, Fort something-or-other, 
named after what's-his-namc?" 

"Fort Patton." 

"That's it. Well, get them on 
the command circuit — " 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



1 11 



"With visual," put in the Old 
Man. 

"With visual, of course, and 
we'll show this — I mean we'll get 
the true situation in Iowa." 

The Air Marshal handed a byyour-leave-sir to the President, 
went to the stereo tank and 
patched in with Security General 
Headquarters. He asked for the 
officer of the watch at Fort Patton, Iowa. 

The tank showed the inside of 
a communications center. Filling 
the foreground was a young officer. His rank and corps showed 
on his cap, but his chest was bare. 
Martinez turned triumphantly to 
the Old Man. 

"You see?" 

*'I see." 

"Now to make certain. Lieutenant!" 

"Yes, sir!" The young fellow 
looked awestruck and kept glancing from one famous face to another. Reception and bi-angle 
were in sync; the eyes of the 
image looked where they seemed 
to look. 

"Stand up and turn around," 
Martinez continued. 

"Uh? Why, certainly, sir." He 
seemed puzzled, but did so, and 
it took him almost out of scan* 
We could see his bare back up to 
the short ribs — no higher. 

"Confound it!" shouted Martinez. "Sit down and turn around." 

"Yes, sir!" The youth seemed 



flustered. He added, "Just a moment while I widen the view 
angle, sir.'* 

The picture melted and rippling 
rainbows chased across the tank. 
The young officer's voice was still 
coming over the audio channel. 
"There, is that better, sir?" 

"Damn it, we can't see a thing!'* 
"You can't? Just a moment, 
sir." 

Suddenly the tank came to life 
and I thought for a moment that 
we were back at Fort Patton. But 
it was a major in the screen this 
time and the place looked larger. 
"Supreme Headquarters," the image announced. "Communications 
officer of the watch, Major Donovan." 

"Major," Martinez said in controlled tones, "I was hooked in 
with Fort Patton. What happened?" 

"Yes, sir; I was monitoring it. 
We've had a slight technical difficulty. We'll put your call through 
again in a moment." 

"Well, hurry!" 

The Old Man stood up. "Call 
me when you've cleared up that 
'slight technical difficulty.' I'm 
going to bed." 

XV 

IF I have given the impression 
that Secretary Martinez was 
stupid, I am sorry. Everyone had 
trouble at first believing what the 



114 




 



slugs could do, including me. 
There were no flies on Marshal 
Rexton, either. The two worked 
all night, after convincing themselves by more calls to known 
danger spots that "technical interruptions" do not occur so conveniently. They called the Old 
Man about four A.M. and he 
called me. 

They were in the same room, 
Martinez, Rexton, a couple of bis 
brass, and the Old Man. The 
President came in, wearing a 
bathrobe and followed by Mary, 
as I arrived. Martinez started to 
speak but the Old Man cut in. 
"Let's see your back, ToraV 

Mary signaled that everything 
was okay, but the Old Man chose 
not to see her. "I mean it," he 
persisted. 

The President said quietly, 
"Perfectly correct, Andrew," and 
slipped his robe off his shoulders. 
His back was clean. "If I don't 
set an example, how can I expect 
others to cooperate?" 

Martinez and Rexton had been 
shoving pins into a map, red for 
bad, green for good, and a few 
amber ones for doubtful. Iowa 
looked like measles; New Orleans 
and the Teche country were no 
better. So was Kansas City. The 
upper end of the Missouri-Mississippi system, from Minneapolis 
and St. Paul down to St. Louis, 
was clearly enemy territory. 
There were fewer red pins from 



there down to New Orleans — but 
no green ones. There was a hot 
spot around El Paso and two on 
the East Coast. 

The President looked it over. 
"We shall need the help of Canada and Mexico," he said. "Any 
reports?" 

"None that mean anything, 
sir," 

"Canada and Mexico," the Old 
Man said seriously, "will be just 
a start. You are going to need 
the whole world." 

The President drew a finger 
across the map. "Any trouble 
getting messages to the West 
Coast?" 

"Apparently not, sir," Rexton 
told him. "The parasites don't 
seem to interfere with straightthrough relay. But all military 
communications I have shifted to 
relay through the space stations." 
He glanced at his watch finger. 
"Station Gamma, at the moment." 

"Hmmm — " said the President, 
worried. "Andrew, could these 
things storm a space station?" 

"How would I know?" the Old 
Man answered testily. "I don't 
know whether their ships arc built 
for it or not. More probably 
they would, do it by infiltration, 
through the supply rockets." 

"Don't worry about it," Rexton. 
said. "The costume we are wearing is customary in a station. A 
man fully dressed would stand

.1 IS 



out like an overcoat on the beach. 
But we'll see." He gave orders to 
an assistant. 

The President resumed studying the map. "So far as we know," 
he said, pointing to Grinnell, 
Iowa, "all this derives from a 
single landing, here." 

The Old Man answered, "So far 
as we know." 

I said, "Oh, no!" They all 
looked at me. "There were at 
least three more landings — I 
know there were — before I was 
rescued." 

The Old Man looked dumbfounded. "Are you sure, son? We 
thought we had wrung you dry." 

"Of course I'm sure." 

"Why didn't you mention it?" 

I tried to explain how it feels 
to be possessed, how you know 
what is going on, but everything 
seems dreamy, equally important 
and unimportant. I grew quite 
upset. I am not the jittery type, 
but being ridden by a master does 
something to you. 

The Old Man said, "Steady 
down, son," and the President 
gave me a reassuring smile. 

Rexton said, "The point is: 
where did they land? We might 
still capture a ship." 

"I doubt it," the Old Man answered. "They did a cover-up on 
the first one in a matter of hours. 
If it was the first," he added 
thoughtfully. 

I went to the map and tried to 



think. Sweating, I pointed to New 
Orleans. "I'm pretty sure one was 
about here. I don't know where 
the others landed." 

"How about here?" Rexton 
asked, pointing to the East Coast. 

"I don't know." 

"Can't you remember anything ' 
else?" Martinez demanded, annoyed. "Think, man!" 

I thought until my skull ached, 
then pointed to Kansas City. "I 
sent several messages here, but I 
don't know whether they were 
shipment orders or not." 

Rexton looked at the map. 
"We'll assume a landing near 
Kansas City. The technical boys 
can do a problem on it. It may 
be subject to logistic analysis; 
we might derive the other landing." 

"Or landings," added the Old 
Man. 

XVI 

TTINDSIGHT is confoundedly 
futile. At the moment the 
first Saucer landed, the menace 
could have been stamped out by 
one bomb. At the time Mary, the 
Old Man and I reconnoitered 
around Grinnell, we three alone 
might have killed every slug, had 
we known where they all were. 
Had "Schedule Bareback" been 
ordered during the first week, it 
alone might have turned the trick. 
But it was quickly clear that 



116 




 



"Schedule Bareback" had failed 
as an offensive measure. As a defense it was useful. The uncontaminatcd areas could be kept so. 
Areas contaminated but not 
"scoured" were cleaned up — 
Washington itself, and New 
Philadelphia. New Brooklyn, too 
- — there I had been able to give 
specific advice. The entire East 
Coast turned from speckled to 
solid green. 

But as the middle of the country filled in on the map, it filled 
in red. The infected areas stood 
out in ruby light now, for the 
wall map studded with pins had 
been replaced by a huge electronic military map, ten miles to 
the inch, covering one wall of 
the conference room. It was a 
repeater map, the master being 
down in the New Pentagon. 

The country was split in two, 
as if a giant had washed red pigment down the central valley. 
Two amber paths bordered the 
band held by the slugs ; these 
were the only areas of real activity, places where line-of -sight 
reception was possible both from 
stations held by the enemy and 
from stations still in the hands of 
free men. One started near Minneapolis, swung west of Chicago 
and east of St. Louis, then meandered through Tennessee and 
Alabama to the Gulf. The other 
cut a path through the Great 
Plains and came out near Corpus 



Christi. El Paso was the center 
of a ruby area unconnected with 
the main body. 

I wondered what was going on 
in those border strips. I was 
alone; the Cabinet was meeting 
and the President had taken the 
Old Man with him. Rexton and 
his brass had left earlier. I stayed 
because I hesitated to wander 
around in the White House, so 
I fretted and watched amber 
lights blink red and, much less 
frequently, red lights blink amber 
or green. 

I wondered how a visitor with 
no status managed to get breakfast. I had been up since four 
and so far I had had one cup of 
coffee, served by the President's 
valet. Even more urgently, I 
wanted to find a washroom. At 
last I got desperate enough to 
try doors. The first two were 
locked ; the third was what I 
wanted. It was not marked "Sacred to the Chief" so I used it. 

When I came back, Mary was 
in the map room. 

I looked at her stupidly. "I 
thought you were with the President." 

She smiled. "I got chased out. 
The Old Man took over." 

"Mary, I've been wanting to 
talk with you and this is the first 
chance I've had. I guess — Well, 
anyway, I shouldn't have — I 
mean, according to the Old 
Man — " I stopped, my carefully 



THE PUPPET MASTERS

ehearsed speech in ruins. "I 
houldn't have said what I did," 
J concluded miserably. 

She put a hand on my arm. 
"What you said and what you 
did were fair enough on the basis 

what you knew. The important 
hing, to me, is what you did for 
te. The rest does not matter — xcept that I am happy again to 
now that you don't despise me." 

"Damn it, don't be so noble!" 

She gave me a merry smile, not 
at all like the gentle one with 
which she had greeted me. "Sam, 
[ think you like your women to 
be a bit bitchy. I warn you, I 
-can be." She went on, "You are 
still worried about that slap, too. 
All right, I'll pay it back." She 
reached up and patted me gently 
on the cheek. "There, it's paid 
and you can forget it." 

Her expression suddenly 
changed, she swung on me, and 
I thought my head had been 
taken off. "And that," she said, 
"pays back the one I got from 
your girl friend!" 

I raised a hand and she tensed 
— but I just wanted to touch my 
stinging cheek. "She's not my girl 
friend," I said lamely. 

We eyed each other and simultaneously burst out laughing. She 
put her hands on my shoulders 
and let her head collapse on my 
right one, still laughing. "Sam," 
she managed to say, "I'm so 
sorry. I shouldn't have done it. 



At least I shouldn't have slapped 
you so hard." 

" The devil you're sorry," I 
growled, "but you didn't have to 
have put english on it. You damn 
near took the hide off." 

"Poor Sam!" She touched it; 
it hurt. "She's really not your girl 
friend?" 

"No, but not because I didn't 
try." 

''I'm sure it wasn't. Who is 
your girl friend, Sam?" 

"You are, you vixen!" 

"Yes," she said comfortably, 
"I am — if you'll have me. I told 
you that before. Bought and paid 
for." 

She was waiting to be kissed; 
I pushed her away. "Go to hell. 
I don't want you bought and paid 
for." 

"I put it badly. Paid for, but 
not rjbught. I'm here because I 
want to be. Now will you kiss 
me, please?" 

I felt myself sinking into a 
warm golden haze and I did not 
ever want to come up. Finally I 
had to break and gasp, "I think 
I'll sit down for a minute." 

She said, "Thank you, Sam," 
and let me. 

■1%/|ARY ," I said presently, 
J-'-l "there is something I am 

hoping you possibly could do for 

me." 

"Yes?" she asked eagerly. 
"Tell me how in the name of

GAIAXY SCIENCE FICTION. 



Ned a person gets breakfast 
around here. I'm starved." 

She looked startled, but she answered, "Why, certainly!" 

I don't know how she did it ; 
she may have butted into the 
White House pantry and helped 
herself, but she returned in a few 
minutes with sandwiches and two 
bottles of beer. I was cleaning up 
my third corned beef on rye when 
I said, "Mary, how long do you 
figure that meeting will last?" 

"Oh, I'd give it a minimum of 
two hours. Why?" 

"In that case," I said, swallowing the last bite, "we have time 
to duck out, find a registry office, 
get married and return before the 
Old Man misses us." 

She did not answer. Instead she 
stared at the bubbles in her beer. 
"Well?" I insisted. 

She raised her eyes. "I'll do it 
if you say so." 

"You don't want to marry 
me?" 

"Don't be angry, darling. You 
don't know me yet. Get acquainted with me ; you might 
change your mind." 

"I'm not in the habit of changing my mind." 

She glanced up, then looked 
away sadly. I felt my face get 
hot. "That was a very special circumstance," I protested. "It could 
not happen to us again in a hundred years. That wasn't me talking; it was — " 



She stopped me. "I know, Sam. 
But you don't have to prove anything. I won't run out on you and 
I didn't mistrust you. Take me 
away on a weekend; better yet, 
move into my apartment. If I 
wear well, there's always time 
to make me what great-grandmother called an 'honest woman,* 
heaven knows why." 

I must have looked sullen. She 
put a hand on mine and said seriously, "Look at the map, Sam." 

I turned my head. Red as ever, 
or more so — the danger zone 
around El Paso had increased. 
She went on, "Let's get this 
cleaned up first, dear. Then, if 
you still want to, ask me again. 
In the meantime, you can have 
the privileges without the responsibilities." 

What could be fairer than that? 
The trouble was it was not the 
way I wanted it. Why will a man 
who has been avoiding marriage 
like the plague suddenly decide 
that nothing less will suit him? 

WHEN the meeting was over, 
the Old Man collared me 
and took me for a walk. Yes, a 
walk, though we went only as far 
as the Baruch Memorial Bench. 
There he sat down, fiddled with 
his pipe, and scowled. The day 
was as muggy as only Washington can get; the park was almost 
deserted. 

He said, " 'Schedule Counter 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



lit 



Blast' starts at midnight. We 
swoop down on every relay station, broadcast station, newspaper office, and Western Union 
office in 'Zone Red'." 

"Sounds good," I answered. 
"How many men?" 

He did not answer. "I don't 
like it." 

"Huh?" 

"The President went on channels and told everybody to peel 
off their shirts. We find that the 
message did not reach infected 
territory. What's the next development?" 

I shrugged. " 'Schedule Counter 
Blast,' I suppose." 

"That hasn't happened yet. 
Think — it has been more than 
twenty-four hours. What should 
have happened and hasn't?" 

"Should I know?" 

"You should, if you are ever 
going to amount to anything on 
your own. Here." He handed me 
a combo key. "Scoot out to Kansas City and take a look-see. Stay 
away from comm stations, cops, 
and — stay away from them. Look 
at everything else. And don't get 
caught. Be back here a half hour 
before midnight. Get going." 

"A lot of time you allow to case 
a whole city," I complained. "It 
will take three hours just to drive 
to Kansas City." 

"More than three hours/' he 
answered. "Don't attract attention by getting a ticket. Move." 



So I moved. The combo was 
to the car we had comedown in; 
I picked it up at Rock Creek Park 
platform. Traffic was light and I 
commented on it to the despatches "Freight and commercial 
carriers are grounded," he answered. "The emergency. You got 
a military clearance?" 

I could get one by phoning the 
Old Man, but bothering him 
about trivial things does not endear one to him. I said, "Check 
the combo." 

He shrugged and slipped it in 
his machine. My hunch had been 
right; his eyebrows shot up. "Boy, 
you rate!" he commented. "You 
must be the President's caddy!" 

Once launched, I set the controls for K ansas City at legal 
max and tried to think. The 
transponder beeped as radar 
beams hit it each time I slid from 
one control block into the next, 
but no faces appeared on the 
screen. Apparently the Old Man's 
combo was good for the route, 
emergency or not. I began to wonder what would happen when I 
slipped over into the red areas— 
and then realized what he had 
meant by "the next development." 

One tends to think of communications as meaning Hne-of-sight 
channels and nothing else. But 
"communications" means all traffic, even dear old Aunt Mamie, 
headed for California and stuffed 



120 




 



with gossip. The slugs had seized 
the channels, but news can't be 
stopped that easily; such measures merely slow it down. Ergo, 
if the slugs expected to retain 
control where they were, seizing 
the channels would be just their 
first step. 

What would they do next? 
They would do something and I, 
being a part of "communications" 
by definition, had better be prepared for evasive action if I 
wanted to save my pink skin. 
The Mississippi River and Zone 
Red were sliding closer by the 
minute. I wondered what would 
happen the first time my recognition signal was picked up by a 
station controlled by masters. 

I judged that I was probably 
safe in the air, but that T had 
better not let them spot me landing. Elementary. 

"Elementary" in the face of a 
traffic control net which was described as the No-Sparrow-ShallFall plan. The traffic men boasted 
that a butterfly could not make a 
forced landing anywhere in the 
United States without alerting the 
search & rescue system. Not quite 
true — but I was no butterfly. 

On foot I will make a stab at 
penetrating any security screen, 
mechanical, manned, electronic, 
or mixed. But how can you use 
misdirection in a car making 
westing a full degree every seven 
minutes? Or hang a stupid^ in


nocent look on the nose of a 
duo? If I went in on foot, the 
Old Man would get his report come next Michaelmas; he; 
wanted it before midnight. 

Once, in a rare mellow mood, 
the Old Man told me that he did 
not bother agents with detailed 
instructions. Give a man a mission; let him sink or swim. I said 
his method must use up a lot of 
agents. 

"Some," he had admitted, "but 
not as many as the other way. I 
believe in the individual and I 
try to pick those who are survivor 
type*." 

"And how in hell," I had asked, 
"do you pick a 'survivor type'?" 

He had grinned wickedly. "A 
survivor type is one who comes 
back." 

So I was about to find out 
which type I was — and damn his 
icy heart! 

"|l/¥Y course would take me to1TJ. warf j St. Louis, swing me 
around the city loop, and on to 
Kansas City. But St. Louis was 
in Zone Red. The map had shown 
Chicago as green; the amber line 
had zigzagged west somewhere 
above Hannibal, Missouri — and 
I wanted very badly to cross the 
Mississippi while still in Zone 
Green. A car crossing that milewide river would make a radar 
blip as sharp as a desert star. 
1 signaled block control for per


THE PUPPET MASTERS

mission to descend to local -traffic 
level, then did so without waiting, 
resuming manual control and cutting my speed. I headed north. 

Short of the Springfield loop I 
headed west, staying low. When 
I reached the river I crossed 
slowly, close to the water, with 
my transponder shut down. Sure, 
you can't shut off your radar recognition signal in the air — but 
I had hopes, if local traffics were 
being monitored while I crossed, 
that my blip would be mistaken 
for a boat on the river. 

I did not know certainly 
whether the next block control 
station across the river was Zone 
Red or Zone -Green. I was about 
to cut in the transponder again, 
on the assumption that it would 
be safer to get back into the traffic system, when I noticed the 
shoreline opening up ahead. The 
map did not show a tributary; I 
judged it to be an inlet, or a 
new channel not yet mapped. I 
dropped almost to water level and 
headed into it. The stream was 
narrow, meandering, almost overhung by trees, and I had no more 
business taking a sky car into it 
than a bee has of flying down 
a trombone. But it afforded perfect radar "shadow;" I could get 
lost in it. 

In a few minutes I was lost — ■ 
lost myself, right off the map. 
The channel switched and turned 
and cut back and I was so busy 



bucking the car by hand that I 
lost all track of navigation. I 
swore and wished that the car 
were a triphib so that I could 
land on water. The trees suddenly 
broke; I saw a stretch of level 
land, kicked her over and squatted her in with a deceleration that 
nearly cut me in two against my 
safety belt. But I was down and 
no longer trying to play catfish 
in a muddy stream. 

I wondered what to do. No 
doubt there was a highway close 
by. I had better find it and stay 
on the ground. That was silly — 
there was no time for ground 
travel; I musr get back into the 
air. But 1 did not dare until I 
knew positively whether traffic 
here was being controlled by free 
men or by slugs. 

I had not turned on the stereo 
since leaving Washington. Now I 
did so, hunting for a newscast, 
but not finding one. I got (a) a 
lecture by Myrtle Doolightly, 
Ph. D., on Why Husbands Grow 
Bored, sponsored by the Uth-agen Hormone Company; (b) a 
trio of girl hepsters singing // 
Kou Mean What I Think You 
Mean, What Are We Waiting 
For? (c) an episode in Lucretia 
Learns About Life. 

Dear Doctor Myrtle was fully 
dressed. The trio were dressed the 
way one would expect, but they 
did not turn their backs to the 
camera. Lucretia alternated hav

ing her clothes torn off with taking them off willingly, but the 
camera always cut or the lights 
went out just before I could see 
if her back was bare — of slugs, 
that is. 

And none of it meant anything. 
Those programs could have been 
taped months before the President announced "Schedule bareback." I was still switching channels, trying to find a newscast, 
when I found myself staring into 
the unctuous smile of an announcer. He was fully dressed. 

It was one of those giveaway 



shows. He was saying : " — and 
some very lucky little woman sitting by her screen right this minute is about to receive, absolutely 
free, a General Atomics Six-inOne Automatic Home Butler. 
Will it be you? You? Or lucky 
you?" He turned away from scan; 
I could see his shoulders. They 
were covered by a jacket and distinctly rounded, almost humped. 
I was inside Zone Red. 

SWITCHING off, I realized 
that I was being watched by 
a male about nine years old. He 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



123 



was wearing only shorts — at his 
age that's standard style. I threw 
back the wind screen. "Hey, bub, 
where's the highway?" 

He answered, "Road to Macon's up yonder. Say, mister, 
that's a Cadillac Zipper, ain't it?" 

"Sure thing. Where yonder?" 

"Give me a ride, huh, will 
you?" 

I shrugged. While he climbed 
in, I opened my kit, got out shirt, 
trousers, and jacket. I said, 
"Maybe I shouldn't put these on. 
Do people around here wear 
shirts?" 

He scowled. "Of course they 
do. Where do you think you are 
— in Arkansas ?" I asked again 
about the road. He said, "Can I 
punch the button when we take 
off, huh?" 

I explained that we were going 
to stay on the ground. He was 
annoyed but condescended to 
point a direction- I drove cautiously as the car was heavy for 
unpaved countryside. Presently 
he said to turn. 

Quite a bit later, I stopped and 
said, "Are you going to show me 
that road, or am I going to wallop you?" He opened the door 
and slid out. "Hey!" I yelled. 

He looked back. "Over that 
way," he jeered. I turned the car, 
not expecting to find a highway, 
but it was only fifty yards away. 
The brat had caused me to drive 
eround three sides of a square 



so he'd get a longer ride. 

If you could call it a highway 
—there was not an ounce of rubber in the paving. Still, it was a 
road; I followed it to the west. 
All in all, I had wasted an hour. 

Macon, Missouri, seemed too 
normal to be reassuring; "Schedule Bareback" obviously had not 
been heard of. I gave serious 
thought to checking this town, 
then beating back the way I had 
come, while I could. Pushing farther into country which I knew 
to be controlled by the masters 
made me jittery; I wanted to run. 

But the Old Man had said 
Kansas City. I drove the belt 
around Macon and pulled into a 
landing flat on the west. There 
f queued up for local traffic 
launching and headed for Kansas City in a mess of farmers' 
copters and local craft. I would 
have to hold local speeds across 
the state, but that was safer than 
getting into the hot pattern with 
my transponder identifying ray 
car to every block control. The 
field was automatically serviced; 
it seemed probable that I had 
managed to enter the Missouri 
traffic pattern without arousing 
suspicion. 

XVII 

KANSAS City was not hurt in 
the bombings, except on the 
east, where Independence used to 



1M 




 



be. Consequently it never had" to 
be rebuilt. From the southeast 
you can drive as far as Swope 
Park before having to choose between parking or paying toll to 
enter the city proper. Or you 
can fly in and make another 
choice: land in the landing flats 
north of the river and take the 
tunnels into the city, or land on 
the downtown platforms south of 
Memorial Hill. 

I decided not to fly in; I did 
not want to have to pick the car 
up through, a checking system. I 
do not like tunnels in a pinch, 
nor launching platform elevators. 
A man can easily be trapped in 
them. 

Frankly, I did not want to go 
into the city at all. 

I roaded the car on Route 40 
and drove into the Meyer Boulevard toll gate. The line waiting 
was quite long; I began to feel 
hemmed in as soon as another car 
filled in behind me. But the gatekeeper took my toll without 
glancing at me. I glanced at him, 
all right, but could not tell 
whether or not he was being 
ridden. 

I drove through the gate — only 
to be stopped just beyond. A barrier dropped in front of me and 
I barely managed to stop the car, 
whereupon a cop stuck his head 
in. 

"Safety check," he said. ".Climb 
out." I protested. "The city is 



having a safety drive/' he explained. "Here's your car check. 
Pick it up on the other side of 
the barrier. Get out and go in 
that door." 

He pointed to a building near 
the curb. 

"What for?" 

"Eyesight and reflexes. You're 
holding up the line." 

In my mind's eye I saw the 
map with Kansas City glowing 
red. That the city was "secured" 
I was sure; therefore this mildmannered policeman was almost 
surely hag-ridden. But short of 
shooting him and making an 
emergency takeoff, there was 
nothing to do but comply. I got 
out grumbling and walked slowly 
toward the building. It wrs a 
temporary job with an old-style 
unpowered door. I pushed it open 
with a toe and glanced both sides 
and up before I entered. There 
was an empty anteroom with 
door beyond. 

Someone inside called, "Come 
in." 

There were two men in white 
coats, one with a doctor's reflector strapped to his head. He 
said briskly, "This won't take a 
minute. Step over here." He 
closed the door 1 had entered; I 
heard the lock click. 

It was a sweeter setup than we 
had worked out for the Constitution Club. Spread out on a table 
were transit cells for masters, al


THE PUPPET MASTERS 



125 



ready opened and warmed. The 
second man had one ready — for 
me, I knew — and was holding it 
toward him, so that I could not 
see the slug. The transit cells 
would not arouse alarm in the 
victims; the medical men always 
have odd things at hand. 

As for the test, I was being invited to place my eyes against 
the goggles of an ordinary visual 
acuity tester. The "doctor" would 
keep me there, blindfolded without knowing it and reading test 
figures, while his "assistant" fitted me with a master. No violence, no slips, no protests. 

It was not necessary, as I had 
learned during my own "service," 
to bare the victim's back. Just 
touch the master ' to the neck, 
then let the recruit himself adjust his clothing to cover his 
master. 

"Over here," the "doctor" repeated. "Place your eyes against 
the eyepieces.** 

I went to the bench on which 
was mounted the acuity tester. 
Then I turned suddenly around. 

The assistant had moved in, 
the cell ready in his hands. As I 
turned he tilted it away from me. 

"Doctor," I said, "I wear contact lenses. Should I take them 
off first?" 

"No, no." he snapped. "Let's 
not waste time.'* 

"But, Doctor," I protested, "I 
want you to see how they fit. 



I've had a little trouble with the 
left one." I lifted both hands and 
pulled back the lids of my left 
eye. "See?" 

He -said angrily, "This is not a 
clinic. Now, if you please — " 
They were both in reach; moving 
quickly, I snapped my arms out 
and grabbed at the spot between 
each set of shoulderblades. With 
each hand I struck something soft 
under the coats and felt revulsion 
clutch me. 

Once I saw a cat struck by a 
ground car; the poor thing sprang 
straight up with its back arched 
the wrong way and all limbs flying. These two unlucky men did 
the same thing. They contorted 
every muscle in a grand spasm. I 
could not hold them; they jerked 
out of my arms and flopped to the 
floor. But there was no need to 
hang on. After that first convulsion they went limp. 

Someone was knocking. I called 
out, "Just a moment. The doctor 
is busy." It stopped. I made sure 
the door was locked, then bent 
over the "doctor" and pulled up 
his coat to see what I had done 
to his master. 

Thfv thing was a ruptured mess. 
So was the one on the other man, 
which pleased me heartily. I had 
determined to bum the slugs with 
my gun if they were not already 
dead, and I was not sure that I 
could do so without killing the 
hosts. I left the men to live or die 



124 




 



— -or be seized again by titans. I 
had no way to help them. 

The masters waiting in their 
cells were another matter. With a 
fan beam and max charge, I 
burned them all. There were two 
large crates against the wall; I 
beamed them also until the wood 
charred. 

The knocking resumed. I looked around hastily for somewhere 
to hide the two men, but there 
was nowhere, so I decided to run 
for it. As I was about to go out 
the exit, I felt that something was 
missing. I looked around again. 

There seemed to be nothing 
suited to my purpose. I could use 
clothing from the "doctor" or his 
helper, but I did not want to. 
Then I noticed the dust cover for 
the acuity tester. I loosened my 
jacket, snatched up the cover, 
wadded it and stuffed it under my 
shirt between my shoulders. With 
my jacket zipped, it made a bulge 
of about the proper size. 

Then I went out, feeling pretty 
cocky. 

Another cop took my car check. 
He glanced sharply at me, then 
motioned me to climb in. I did 
and he said, "Go to police headquarters, under the City Hall." 

"Police headquarters, City 
Hall," I repeated and gunned her 
Ahead. I started in that direction 
and turned onto Nichols Freeway. 
I came to a stretch where traffic 
thinned out, and punched the but


ton to shift license plates. It 
seemed possible that there was 
already a call out for the plates I 
had been showing at the gate. I 
wished that I had been able to 
change the car's colors as well. 

Before the Freeway reached 
Mcgee Traffic Way, I turned 
down a ramp and stuck thereafter to sidestreets. It was eighteen hundred, Zone Six time, and 
I was due in Washington in four 
and one-half hours. 

XVIII 

'■^HE city did not have the right 
flavor, as if it were a clumsily 
directed play. I tried to put my 
finger on the fault ; it slipped 
away. 

Kansas City has many neighborhoods made up of family units 
a century old or more. Kids roll 
on lawns and householders sit on 
their front porches, just as their 
great-grandparents did. If there 
are bomb shelters around, they do 
not show. The queer, old, bulky 
houses, put together by guildsmen long since dead, make those 
neighborhoods feel like enclaves 
of security. I cruised through 
along streets, dodging dogs, rubber balls and toddlers, and tried 
to get the feel of the place. It 
was the slack of the day, time for 
a drink, for watering lawns, for 
neighborly chatting. I saw a 
woman bending over a flower bed. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



\17 



She was wearing a sunsuit and 
her back was bare; clearly she 
was not wearing a master, nor 
were the two kids with her. What 
could be wrong? 

-It was a very hot day; I began 
to look for sunsuited women and 
men in shorts. Kansas City is in 
the Bible Belt, so I found neople 
dressed both ways — but the proportions were wrong. Sure, there 
were plenty of kids dressed for 
the weather, but in several miles 
of driving I saw the bare backs 
of only five women and two men. 

X should have seen more like 
five hundred. 

Cipher it out. While some jackets undoubtedly did nor cover 
masters, by simple proportion 
well over ninety per cent of the 
population must be possessed. 

The masters did not simply 
hold key points and key officials; 
the masters were the city. 

I felt a blind urge to blast off 
and streak out of Zone Red at 
emergency maximum. Knowing 
that I had escaped the gate trap, 
they would be looking for me. I 
might be the only free man driving a car in the entire city — and 
they were all around me! 

I fought it down. An agent who 
turns panicky is not likely to get 
out of a tight spot. But it was 
hard to be calm. 

I must be wrong; there could 
not possibly be enough masters 
to saturate a city with a million 



population. I remembered my 
own experiences, recalling how we 
picked our recruits and made each 
new host count. Of course that 
had been a secondary invasion 
depending on shipments, whereas 
Kansas City almost certainly had 
had a Saucer land nearby. Still it 
did not make sense; it would take 
a dozen or more to carry enough 
masters to saturate Kansas City. 
If there had been that many, 
surely the space stations would 
have radar-tracked their landing 
orbits. 

Could it be that they had no 
trajectories to track? We did not 
know what the masters were 
capable of in engineering and it 
was not safe to judge their limitations by our own. 

But the data I had led to a 
conclusion which contradicted 
common logic; therefore I must 
check before I reported. One thing 
seemed sure : even if the masters 
had almost saturated this city, 
they were still keeping up the 
masquerade, permitting the city 
to look like a city of free human 
beings. Perhaps I was not as conspicuous as I feared. 

I moseyed along another mile 
or so, going nowhere. Finding myself heading into the retail district 
around the Plaza, I swung away. 
Where there are crowds, there are 
cops, and the masters make a 
special point of possessing police 
forces. I passed a public swim

ming pool, noticed it, and was 
several blocks away before I 
realized it had carried a sign — 

CLOSED FOR THE SEASON. 

Item: a trap at the city*s toll 
gates ; item : too few sunsuits ; 
item: a swimming pool closed in 
the hottest part of the summer. 

Conclusion: the slugs were incredibly more numerous than 
anyone had dreamed. 

Corollary: "Schedule Counterblast" was based on a mistaken 
estimate; it would work as well as 
hunting rhinoceri with a slingshot. 

Counter argument: I could 
hear Secretary Martinez' polite 
sarcasm tearing my report to 
shreds. I needed proof strong 
enough to convince the President 
over the reasonable objections of 
his official advisors— and I had to 
have it now. Breaking all traffic 
laws, I could not clip much off 
two and a half hours running time 
back to Washington. 

What should I do? Go downtown, mingle with crowds, and 
then tell Martinez that I was sure 
that almost every man I passed 
was possessed? How could I prove 
it? For that matter, how could I 
myself be certain? As long as the 
titans kept up the farce of ""business as usual," the telltales would 
be subtle, a super- abundance of 
round shoulders, not enough bare 
ones. 

I had some notion of how the 



city had been saturated, granting 
a large enough supply of slugs. I 
felt sure that I would encountef 
another toll gate trap on the way 
out and that there would be others 
on launching platforms and at 
every entrance and exit to the city 
proper. Every person leaving 
would be a new agent; every person entering would be a new slave. 

I had noticed a vendo-printer 
for the Kansas City Srar on the 
last corner I had passed. Now I 
swung around the block, pulled 
up to it and got out. I shoved a 
dime in the slot and waited nervously for my paper to be printed. 

The Star's format had its usual 
dull respectability — no excitement, no mention of an emergency, no reference to "Schedule 
Bareback." The lead story was 
headed phone service disrupted 
by sunsfot storm, with a subhead City Semi-Isolated by Solar 
Static. There was a 3-col, semistereo, tru-kolor of the sun, its 
face disfigured by cosmic acne. 
It was a convincing and unexciting explanation of why Mamie 
Schultz, herself free of parasites, 
could not get her call through to 
Grandma in Pittsburgh. 

I tucked the paper under my 
arms to study later and turned 
back to my car . . . just as a police car glided silently up and 
cramped in across the nose of it. 
A moment before the corner was 
deserted. Suddenly there were 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



people all around and the cop was 
coming toward me. My hand 
crept toward my gun; I would 
have dropped him had I not been 
sure that most of those around 
me were equally dangerous. 

He stopped in front of me. "Let 
me see- your license," he said 
pleasantly. 

"Certainly, officer. It's clipped 
to the instrument board." I stepped past him, letting it be assumed that he would follow. I 
could fuel him hesitate, then take 
the bait. I led him around between my car and his. This let 
me see that he did not have a 
mate in his car, a most welcome 
variation from human practice. 
More important, it placed my car 
between me and the too-innocent 
bystanders. 

"There," I said, pointing inside, 
"it's fastened down." Again he 
hesitated, then looked — long 
enough for my left hand to slap 
his shoulders and clutch with all 
its strength. 

His body seemed to explode, so 
violent was the spasm. I was in 
the car and gunning it almost before he hit the pavement. 

The masquerade broke as 
abruptly as it had in Barnes' 
outer office; the crowd closed in. 
One woman clung by her nails to 
the outside of the car for fifty feet 
or more before she fell off. By 
then I was making speed, cutting 
in and out of traffic, ready to 



take to the air but lacking space, 
A street showed up on the left. 
I slammed into it. It was a mistake; trees arched over it and I 
could not take off. The next turn 
was even worse. Of necessity I 
slowed down. Now I was cruising 
at conservative city speed, still 
watching for some boulevard wide 
enough for an illegal takeoff. My 
thoughts began to catch up and 
I realized that there was no sign 
of pursuit. 

My knowledge of the masters 
came to my aid. Except for "direct conference" a titan lives in 
and through his host; he sees 
what the host sees, receives and 
passes on information through 
whatever organs and by whatever means are available to the 
host. It was unlikely that any of 
the slugs at that corner had been 
looking for that particular car 
other than the one inhabiting the 
body of a policeman — and I had 
settled with it! Now, of course, 
the other parasites present would 
be on the lookout for me, too, but 
they had only the abilities and 
facilities of their hosts. I decided that I need treat them with 
no more respect than I would 
give to any casual crowd of witnesses, i.e., ignore them; change 
neighborhoods and forget it. 

For I had barely thirty minutes 
left and I had decided on what I 
needed as proof — a prisoner, a 
man who had been possessed and 



130 




 



could tell what had happened to 
the city. I must act now. 

Even as I decided, I saw a man 
walking in the block ahead, stepping along like a man who sees 
home and supper. I pulled alongside him and said, "Hey!" 

He stopped. "Yes?" , 

"I've just come from City Hall. 
No time to explain — slide in and 
we'll have a direct conference." 

"City Hall? What are you talking about?" 

I said, "Change in plans. Don't 
waste time. Get in!" 

He backed away. I jumped out 
and grabbed at his hunched 
shoulders. My hand struck human flesh, and the man began to 
yell. 

I jumped into the car and got 
out of there fast. When I was 
blocks away I slowed and thought 
it over. Could it be that my nerves 
were so overwrought that I saw 
signs of titans where there were 
none? 

No! The toll gate, the sunsuits, 
the swimming pool, the cop at the 
vendo-printer — those facts I knew 
■ — and this last fact simply meant 
that I had picked the one man in 
ten, or whatever the odds were, 
who was not yet recruited. 

1 speeded up, looking for a new 
victim. 

He was a middle-aged man 
watering his lawn, so normal in 
appearance that I was half a 
mind to pass him by. But I had 



no time left — and he wore a 
sweater which bulged suspiciously. 

He looked up as I stopped. 
"I've just come from City Hall," 
I told him. "You and I need a 
direct conference right away." 

He said quietly, "Come in the 
house. That car is too public." 

I wanted to refuse, but he was 
already heading for the house. As 
I came up he whispered, "Careful. 
The woman is not of us." 

Had I seen her on the veranda, 
I would have passed him by, for 
she was dressed in bra and skirt 
and so could not have been possessed. 

"Your wife?" 

"Yes." 

We stopped on the porch and 
he said, "My dear, this is Mr. 
O'Keefe. We have business to discuss. We'll be in the study." 

She smiled and answered, "Certainly, my love. Good evening, 
Mr. O'Keefe. Sultry, isn't it?" 

I agreed and she went back to 
her knitting. We went inside, 
where the man ushered me into 
his study. Since we were keeping 
the masquerade I went in first, as 
befitted an escorted visitor. I did 
not like turning my back on him. 
For that reason I was half expecting it; he hit me near the base 
of the neck. I rolled with it and 
went down almost unhurt. I continued to roll and fetched up on 
my back. 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



In training school they used to 
slap us with sandbags for trying 
to get up, once down. So I stayed 
down and was threatening him 
with my heels as soon as I hit. He 
shuffled out of range. Apparently 
he did not have a gun and I could 
not get at mine. But there was a 
real fireplace in the room, complete with poker, shovel, and 
tongs ; he circled toward it. A 
smalt table was just out of my 
reach. I lunged, grabbed a leg 
and threw it. 

It caught him in the face as he 
grabbed the poker. Then I was on 
him. 

His master was dying in my 
fingers and he himself was convulsing under its last, terrible 
command when I became aware 
of his wife, screaming in the doorway. I bounced up and let her 
have one. She went down in midscream and I returned to her husband. 

A limp man is amazingly hard 
to lift and he was heavy. Fortunately I am a big husky; I 
managed a lumbering dog trot 
toward the car. I doubt if our 
fight disturbed anyone but his 
wife, hut her screams must have 
aroused half that end of town. 
There were people popping out of 
doors on both sides of the street. 
So far, none of them was near, but 
I was glad that I had left the car 
door open. 

Then I was sorry; a brat like 



the one who had given me trouble 
earlier was inside, fiddling with 
the controls. Cursing, I dumped 
my prisoner in the lounge circle 
and grabbed the kid. He struggled, but I tore him loose and 
threw him out — into the arms of 
the first of my pursuers. He was 
sttll untangling himself when I 
slammed into the seat and shot 
forward without bothering with 
door or safety belt. 

As I took the first corner, the 
door swung shut and I almost 
went out of my seat. I held a 
straight course long enough to 
fasten the belt, cut sharp another 
corner, nearly ran down a ground 
car, and went on. 

I found a wide boulevard — the 
Paseo, I think — and jabbed the 
takeoff key. Possibly I caused 
several wrecks; I had no time to 
look. Without waiting to reach 
altitude, I wrestled her to course 
east. I kept her on manual across 
Missouri and expended every 
launching unit in her racks to give 
more speed. That reckless, illegal 
trick may have saved my neck; 
somewhere over Columbia, just 
as I fired the last one, I felt the car 
shake to concussion. Someone had 
launched an interceptor and the 
pesky thing had fused where I 
had just been. 

There were no more shots, 
which was good; I would have 
been a duck on water from then 
on. My starboard impeller began 



132 




 



to run hot. either from the near 
miss or simply from abuse. I let 
it heat, praying that it would not 
fly apart for another ten minutes. 
Then, with the Mississippi behind 
me and the indicator 'way up into 
"danger," I cut it out and let the 
car limp along on the port unit. 
Three hundred was the best she 
would do— but I was out of Zone 
Red. 

HAD not had time to give my 
™ passenger more than a glance. 
He lay sprawled on the Floor pads, 
unconscious or dead. Now that I 
was back among men and no 
longer had power for illegal 
speeds, there was no reason not 
to go automatic. I flipped the 
transponder, signaled a request 
for a block assignment, and put 
the controls on automatic without waiting for permission. I then 
swung around into the lounge and 
looked my man over. 

He was still breathing. There 
was a welt on his face, but no 
bones seemed broken. I slapped 
his face and dug thumbnails into 
his earlobes, but I could not rouse 
him. The dead slug was beginning 
to stink and I had no way to dispose of it. I left him and went 
back to the control seat. 

The chronometer read twentyone thirty-seven, Washington time 
— and I still had better than six 
hundred miles to go. Allowing 
nothing for landing, for tearing 



over to the White House and 
finding the Old Man, I would 
reach Washington a few minutes 
after midnight. So I was already 
late and the Old Man was sure 
as the devil going to make me 
stay in after school for it. 

I tried to start the starboard 
impeller. No dice. It was probably frozen solid. Just as well. 
Anything that goes that fast can 
be explosively dangerous if it 
gets out of balance. So I desisted 
and tried to raise the Old Man by 
phone. 

The phone would not work. 
Perhaps 1 had jiggered it in one 
of the spots of exercise I had been 
forced to take. I put it back, 
feeling that this was one of those 
days when it had not been worthwhile to get out of bed. I turned 
to the car's communicator and 
punched the emergency tab. 

"Control," I called out. "Control!" 

The screen lighted up and I 
was looking at a young man. He 
was. I saw with relief, bare to the 
waist. "Control answering — Block 
Fox Eleven. What are you doing 
in the air? I've been trying to 
raise you ever since you entered 
my block." 

"Never mind! Patch me into 
the nearest military circuit. This 
is crash priority!" 

He looked uncertain, but the 
screen flickered and another picture built up, showing a military 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



133 



message center. That did my 
heart good; everyone in sight was 
stripped to the waist. In the foreground was a young watch officer. 
I could have kissed him. Instead 
I said, "Military emergency. 
Patch me through the Pentagon 
and there to the White House." 

"Who are you?" 

"I'm a civil agent and you 
wouldn't recognize my I.D. Hurry!" 

I might have talked him into it, 
but he was shouldered out of scan 
by a wing commander. "Land at 
once!" was all he said. 

"Look, skipper," I said, "this 
is a military emergency. You've 
got to put me through. I—" 

"This is a military emergency/' 
he interrupted. "Civil craft have 
been grounded the past three 
hours. Land at once." 

"But I've got to — " 

"Land or be shot down. We are 
tracking; I am about to launch 
an interceptor to burst a half mile 
ahead of you. Make any maneuver but landing, and the next will 
bursit on." 

"Will you listen, please? I'll 
land, but I've got to get — *' He 
switched off. 

■ The first burst seemed short of 
a half mile ahead. I landed and 
cracked up, but without hurting 
myself or my passenger. 

I did not have long to wait. 
They had me flare-lighted aiid 
Were Swooping down before I had 



satisfied myself that the boat 
wouldn't move. They took me in 
and I met the wing commander 
personally. He even put my message through after his psych 
squad got through giving me the 
antidote for the sleep test. By 
then it was one-thirteen, zone five 
— and "Schedule Counter Blast" 
had been under way one hour 
and thirteen minutes. 

The Old Man listened to a 
summary, grunted, then told me 
to see him in the morning.

SCHEDULE Counter Blast" 
was something tremendous. 
The parachute drops were made 
just at midnight, Zone Five, on 
over ninety-six hundred communication points — newspaper offices, block controls, relay stations, 
and so forth. The raiding squads 
were the cream of our skyborne 
forces, plus technicians to put 
each communication point back 
into service. 

Whereupon the President's 
speech was to go out from each 
local station. "Schedule Bareback" would take effect all 
through the infected territory. 
The war would soon be over. 

By twenty-five minutes after 
midnight, reports started coming 
in that such-and-such points were 
secured. A little later there were 
calls for help from other points.. 



GALAXY SCIENCE" FICTION 



By one In the morning most of 
the reserves had been committed, 
but the operation seemed to be 
going wtll — so well that unit commanders were landing and reporting from the ground. 

That was the last anybody ever 
heard of them. 

Zone Red swallowed up the 
task force as if it had never existed—over eleven thousand craft, 
more than a hundred and sixty 
thousand fighting men and technicians, seventy-one group commanders and — why go on? The 
United States had received its 
worst military setback since 
Black Sunday. I am not criticizing Martinez, Rexton, and the 
General Staff, nor those poor 
devils who made the drop. The 
program was based on what appeared to be a true picture, and 
the situation called for fast action 
with the best we had. 

It was nearly daylight, so I understand, before Martinez and 
Rexton got it through their Reads 
that the messages they had gotten 
back about successes were actually fakes sent by their own men 
— our own men — but hag-ridden, 
possessed, inducted by the enemy. 
After my report, more than an 
hour too late to stop the raids, the 
Old Man had tried to get them 
not to send in any more men, but 
they were flushed with success 
and anxious to make a .clean 
sweep. 



The Old Man asked the President to insist on visual checks, 
but the operation was being controlled by relay through Space 
Station Alpha and there just 
aren't enough channels to parallel audio with video through a 
space station. Rexton had said, 
"Quit worrying. As fast as we get 
local stations back in our hands, 
our boys will patch into the 
ground relay net and you will 
have all the visual evidence you 
want." 

The Old Man had pointed out 
that by then it would be too late. 
Rexton had burst out, "Confound 
it, man! Do you want a thousand 
men to be killed just to quiet 
your jitters?" 

The President backed up Rexton. 

By morning they had their visual evidence. Stations in the central valley were giving out with the 
same old Rise and Shine with 
Mary Sunshine, Breakfast with 
the Browns, and such junk. There 
was not a station with the President's stereocast, not one that 
conceded that anything had happened. The military despatches 
tapered off around four o'clock 
and Rexton's frantic calls were 
not answered. 

Task Force Redemption ceased 
to exist — spurlos versenkt.

iext morning. He let me report 
without comment, and without 
jawling me out, which was worse. 

He was about to dismiss me 
vhen I put in, "How about my 
jrisoner? Didn't lie confirm my 
onclusions?" 

*'Oh, him? Still unconscious. 
They don't expect him to live," 

"I'd like to see him." 

"You stick to things you underhand." 

"Well, have you got something 
.'or me to do?" 

"I think you had better— No, 
'rot down to the Zoo. You'll see 
:hings that put a different light 
m what you picked up in Kansas 
City." 

"Huh?" 

"Look up Doctor Morris, the 
assistant director. Tell him I sent 
you." 

Morris was a nice little guy 
who looked like one of his own 
baboons; he turned me over to a 
Doctor Vargas who was a specialist in exotic biologies — the 
same Vargas who was on the 
Second Venus Expedition. He 
showed me what had happened. 
If the Old Man and I had gone 
to the National Zoological Gardens instead of sitting around in 
the park, it would not have been 
necessary for me to go to Kansas 
City. The ten titans we had captured in Congress, plus two the 
next day, had been sent to the Zoo 
to be placed on anthropoids — 



chimps and orangutans, mostly. 
None were on gorillas. 

The Director had had the apes 
locked up in the Zoo's hospital. 
Two chimpanzees. Abelard and 
Heloise, were caged together; they 
had always been mates and there 
seemed no reason to separate 
them. That sums up our psychological difficulty in dealing with 
the titans. Even the men who 
transplanted the slugs still 
thought of the result as apes, 
rather than as titans. 

The next treatment cage held a 
family of tuberculous gibbons. 
They were not used as hosts, 
since they were sick, and there 
was no communication between 
cages. They were shut one from 
another by sliding panels and 
each cage had its own air-conditioning. The next morning the 
panel had been slid back and the 
gibbons and the chimps were together. Abelard or Heloise had 
found some way to pick the lock. 
The lock was supposed to be 
monkey proof, but it was not apecum-titan proof. 

Five gibbons, plus two chimps, 
plus two titans — but the next 
morning there were seven apes 
ridden by seven titans. 

This was discovered while I 
was leaving for Kansas City, not 
enough time for the Old Man to 
have been notified. Had there 
been, he would have known that 
Kansas City was saturated and

"Schedule Counter Blast" would 
not have taken place. 

"I saw the President's broadcast." Dr. Vargas said to me. 
"Weren't you the man who — I 
mean, weren't you the — " 

"Yes, I was the man who," I 
agreed shortly. 

"Then you can tell us a great 
deal about these phenomena." 

"Perhaps I should be able to," 
I admitted, "but I can't." 

"Do you mean that no cases of 
fission reproduction took place 
while you were — uh — their prisoner?" 

"That's right." I thought about 
it. "At least I think that's right." 

"I was given to understand that 
victims have full memory of their 
experiences." 

"Well, they do and they don't." 
I tried to explain the odd detached frame of mind of a servant of the masters. 

"I suppose it could happen 
while you sleep," he said, 

"Maybe. Besides sleep, there is 
another time, or rather times, 
which are difficult to remember. 
During conference." 

"Conference?" When I explained, his eyes lit up. "Oh. you 
mean conjugation." 

"No, I mean conference." 

"We mean the same thing. 
Don't you see? Conjugation and 
fission — they reproduce at will, 
whenever the supply of hosts permits. Probably one contact for 



each fission; then, when opportunity exists, fission. Two adult 
daughter parasites in a matter of 
hours. Less, possibly." 

If that were true — and, looking 
at the gibbons, I could not doubt 
it— then why had we depended 
on shipments at the Constitution 
Club? Or had we? I did not 
know; I did what my master 
wanted done and saw only what 
came under my eyes. But it was 
clear how Kansas City had been 
saturated. With plenty of "live 
stock" at hand and a spaceship 
loaded with transit cells to draw 
from, the titans had reproduced 
to match the human population. 

Assume a thousand slugs in 
that spaceship, the one we believed to have landed near Kansas City; suppose that they could 
reproduce every twenty - four 
hours, when given opportunity. 

First day, one thousand slugs. 

Second day. two thousand. 

Third day, four thousand. 

At the end of the first week-~ 
the eighth day, that is — a hundred and twenty-eight thousand 
slugs! 

After two weeks, more than sixteen million slugs! 

But we did not know that they 
were limited to spawning once a 
day. JNor did we know that a 
Flying Saucer could lift only a 
thousand transit cells. It might 
be ten thousand or more or less. 
Assume ten thousand as breed


THE rUPPET MASTERS 



ing stock with fission every twelve 
hours. In two weeks the answer 
comes out— 

MORE THAN TWO AND A HALF 
TRILLION ! 

The figure did not mean anything; it was cosmic, 

I felt worse than I had in 
Kansas City. 

DR. Vargas introduced me to 
a Dr. Mcllvaine of the 
Smithsonian Institution. Mcllvaine was a comparative psychologist, the author, so Vargas 
told me, of Mars, Venus, and 
Earth : A Study in Motivating 
Purposes. Vargas seemed to expect me to be impressed, but I 
had not read it. Anyhow, how 
can anyone study the motives of 
Martians when they were all dead 
before we climbed down out of 
trees? 

Mcllvaine asked me, "Mr. 
Nivens, how long does a conference last?" 

"Conjugation," Vargas corrected him. 

"Conference," Mcllvaine repeated. "It's the more important 
aspect." 

"But, Doctor," Vargas insisted, 
"conjugation is the means of gene 
exchange whereby mutation is 
spread through — " 

"Anthropocentricism, Doctor ! 
Vou do not know that this life 
form has genes." 

Vargas turned red. "You will 



allow me gene equivalents?" he 
said stiffly. 

"Why should I? You are reasoning by uncertain analogy. 
There is only one characteristic 
common to all life forms and that 
is the drive to survive." 

"And to reproduce," insisted 
Vargas. 

"Suppose the organism is immortal and has no need to reproduce?" 

Vargas shrugged. "We know 
that they reproduce." He gestured at the apes. 

"And I am suggesting," Mcllvaine came back, "that this is 
not reproduction, but a single 
organism availing itself of more 
space. No, Doctor, it is possible 
to get so immersed in the idea of 
the zygote-gamete cycle that one 
forgets there may be other patterns." 

"But throughout the Solar System — " 

Mcllvaine cut him short. "Anthropocentric, terrocentric, solocentric — it is a provincial approach. These creatures may be 
from outside the Solar System 
entirely." 

I said, "Oh, no!" I had a sudden flash picture of the planet 
Titan and with it a choking sensation. 

Neither one noticed. Mcllvaine 
continued, "Take the ameba — a 
more basic and much more successful life form than ours. The 




 



motivational psychology of the 
ameba — " 

I switched off my ears; free 
speech gives a man the right to 
talk about the "psychology" of 
an ameba, but I don't have to 
listen. 

They did some direct experimentation which restored my interest. Vargas had a baboon wearing a slug placed in the cage with 
the gibbons and chimps. As soon 
as the newcomer was dumped in, 
they gathered in a ring facing outward and went into direct conference, slug to slug. 

Mcllvaine jabbed his finger at 
them. "You see? Conference is not 
for reproduction, but for exchange 
of memory. The organism, temporarily divided, has now retdentified itself." 

I could have told him the same 
thing without the double talk. A 
master who has been out of touch 
always gets into direct conference 
as soon as possible. 

"Hypothecation!" Vargas snorted. "They have no opportunity to 
reproduce just now." He ordered 
the boss of the handling crew to 
bring in another ape. 

"Little Abe?" asked the crew 
boss. 

"No, I want one without a 
parasite. Let me see — make it 
Old Red." 

The crew boss said, "Cripes, 
Doc, don't pick on Old Red." 

"This won't hurt him." 



"How about Satan? He's a 
mean bastard anyway." 

"All right, but hurry it up." 

So they brought in Satan, a 
coal-black chimp. He may have 
been aggressive elsewhere; he was 
not so here. When they dumped 
.him inside, he shrank back 
against the door and began to 
whine. It was like watching an 
execution. I had had my nerves 
under control — a man can get 
used to anything — but the ape's 
hysteria was contagious. I wanted to run. 

At first the hag -ridden apes 
simply stared at him like a jury. 
This went on for a long while. 
Satan's whines changed to low 
moans and he covered his face. 
Presently Vargas said, "Doctor! 
Look!" 

"Where?" 

"Lucy, the old female. There.** 
He pointed. 

It was the matriarch of consumptive gibbons. Her back was 
toward us; the slug thereon had 
humped itself together. An iridescent line ran down the center 
of it. 

It began to split as an egg splits. 
In a few minutes only, the division was complete. One new slug 
centered itself over her spine; the 
other flowed down her back as 
she squatted almost to the floor. 
It slithered off, plopped gently on 
the concrete and crept slowly toward Satan. The ape screamed 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



I3> 



hoarsely and swarmed up into the 
top of the cage. 

So help me, the slugs sent a 
squad to arrezt h im — two gibbons, a chimp, and the baboon. 
They tore him loose and held him 
face- down on the floor. 

The slug slithered closer. 

It was a good two feet away 
when it grew a pseudopod — slowly, at first, a stalk that weaved 
around like a cobra. Then it 
lashed out and struck the ape on 
n foot. The others promptly let 
go, but Satan did not move. 

The titan seemed to pull itself 



in by the extension it had formed 
and attached itself to Satan's 
foot. From there it crawled up. 
When it reached the base of his 
spine, Satan sat erect. He shook 
himself and joined the others. 

Vargas and Mcllvaine started 
talking excitedly, apparently unmoved. I wanted to smash something — for me, for Satan. 

Mcllvaine maintained that we 
were seeing something new to our 
concepts, an intelligent creature 
so organized as to be immortal 
and continuous in its personal 
identity — or its group identity.

a secret session of the United Nations. I told the Old Man what I 
had seen and added my opinion 
of Vargas and Mcllvaine. "Boy 
Scouts," I complained, "comparing stamp collections. They don't 
realize it's serious." / 

The Old Man shook his head. 
"Don't sell them short, son," he 
advised me. "They are more likely 
to come up with the answer than 
are you and I." 

"They're more likely to let 
those slugs escape." 

"Did they tell you about the 
elephant?" 

"What elephant? They damn 
near didn't tell me anything; they 
got interested in each other and 
ignored me." 

"You don't understand scientific detachment. About the elephant : an ape with a rider got 
out, somehow. Its body was found 
trampled to death in the elephant 
house. And one of the elephants 
was gone." 

"You mean there is an elephant 
loose with a slug on him?" I had 
a horrid vision, something like a 
tank on the loose with a cybernetic brain. 

"Her," the Old Man corrected 
me. "They found her over in 
Maryland, quietly pulling up cabbages. No parasite." 

"Where did the slug get to?" 
Involuntarily I glanced around. 

"A duo was stolen in the adjoining village, I'd say the slug 



is somewhere west of the Mississippi by now." 

"Anybody missing?" 

He shrugged again. "How can 
you tell in a free country? At 
least, the titan can't hide on a 
human host anywhere short of 
Zone Red." 

His comment made me think 
of something I had seen at the zoo 
and had not reasoned out. Whatever it was, it eluded me. The Old 
Man went on, "It's taken drastic 
action to make the bare -shoulders 
order stick, though. The President 
has had protests on moral 
grounds, not to mention the National Association of Haberdashers." 

"Huh?" 

"You would think we were trying to sell their daughters down to 
Rio, There was a delegation in, 
called themselves the Mothers of 
the Republic, or some such nonsense." 

"The President's time is being 
wasted like that, at a time like 
this?" 

"McDonough handled them. 
But he roped me in on it." The 
Old Man looked pained. "We 
told them that they could not see 
the President unless they stripped. That stopped 'em." 

The thought that had been 
bothering me came to the surface. 
"Say, boss, you might have to." 

"Have to what?" 

"'Make people strip."

He chewed his lip. "What are 
you driving at?" 

"Do we know, as a certainty, 
that a slug can attach itself only 
near the base of the brain?" 

"You should know." 

"I thought I did, but now I'm 
not sure. That's the way we always did it, when I was, uh. with 
them." I recounted in more detail 
what I had seen when Vargas had 
had poor old Satan exposed to a 
slug. "That ape moved as soon as 
the thing reached the base of his 
spine. I'm sure they prefer to ride 
up near the brain. But maybe 
they could ride down inside pants 
or dresses and just put out an extension to the end of the spinal 
cord." 

"Hmm . . . you'll remember, 
son, the first time I had a crowd 
searched, I made everybody peel 
to the buff." 

"I think you were justified. 
They might be able to conceal 
themselves anywhere on the body. 
Take those droopy drawers you've got on. One could hide in them 
and it would just make you look 
a bit satchel-fannied." 

"Want me to take 'em off?" 

"I can do better than that; I'll 
give you the Kansas City 
Clutch." My words were joking 
but**I was not; I grabbed at the 
bunchiness of his pants. He submitted with good grace; then gave 
me the same treatment. 

"But we can't," he complained 



as he sat down, "go around 
clutching women by the rump." 

"You may have to," I pointed 
out, "or make everybody strip." 

"We'll run some experiments.** 

"How?" I asked. 

"You know that head-andspine armor? It's not worth much, 
except to give the wearer a feeling 
of security. I'll tell Doctor Morris 
to take an ape, fit such an armor 
so that a slug can't reach anything but his legs, say, and see 
what happens. We'll vary the 
areas, too." 

"Uh, yes. But don't use an ape." 

"Why not?" 

"Well, they're too human.** 
"Damn it, bub, you can't make 

an omelet — ** 

" — without breaking eggs. 

Okay, but I don't have to like it.**

I was billed as an "expert," but

was no help. The President wanted a "Schedule Bareback" on a 
global scale, but they hemmed 
and hawed and sent the matter 
to committee for investigation. 
The truth was they did not believe us; that was the enemy's 
great advantage — only the burned 
believed in the fire. 

Some nations were safe because 
of their own customs. A Finn who 
did not climb into a steam bath 
in company every day or so 
would have been conspicuous. 
The Japanese, too, were casual 
about mixed bathing. The South 
Seas were relatively safe, as were 
large parts of Africa. France had 
gone enthusiastically nudist, on 
weekends at least, right after 
World War III — a slug would 
have a tough time hiding. But in 
countries where the body -modesty taboo meant something, a 
slug could stay hidden until his 
host dropped dead. The United 
States itself, Canada, England — 
particularly England. 

They flew three slugs, with 
apes, to London. I understand 
the King wanted to set art example as the President had, but 
the Prime Minister, egged on by 
the Archbishop of Canterbury, 
would not let him. Nothing about 
this appeared in the news and the 
story may not be true, but English 
skin was not exposed to the cold 
stares of neighbors. 

The Russian propaganda sys


tem began to blast us as soon as 
they had worked out a new line. 
The whole thing was an "American imperialist fantasy." I wondered why the titans had not attacked Russia first ; the place 
seemed tailor-made for them. On 
second thought, I wondered if 
they had. On third thought, I 
wondered what difference it would 
make. 

I did not see the Old Man during this period; I got my assignments from Oldfield, his deputy. 
Consequently I did not know it 
when Mary was relieved from 
special duty with the President. I 
ran into her in the lounge of the 
Section offices. "Mary!" I yelped. 

She gave me that slow, sweet 
smile and moved over. "Hello, 
darling!" she whispered. She did 
not ask what I had been doing, 
nor scold me that I had not been 
in touch with her, nor even comment on how long it had been. 
Mary let water over the dam take 
care of itself. 

Not me — I babbled. "This is 
great! I thought you were still 
tucking the President into his 
beddy-bye. How long have you 
been here? When do you have to 
go back? Say, can I dial you a 
drink — no, you've got one." I 
started to dial one for myself; it 
popped out into my hand. "Huh? 
How'd this get here?" 

"I ordered it when you came 
in the door." 




 



"Mary, did I tell you that you 
are wonderful?" 
"No." 

"I will. You're wonderful." 
"Thank you." 

I went on, "Couldn't you get 
some leave? They can't expect 
you to be on duty twenty-four 
hours a day , week after week, 
with no time off. I'm going 
straight to the Old Man and tell 
him — " 

"I'm on leave, Sam." 

M — just what I .think of — You 
are? For how long?" 

"Subject to call. All leaves read 
that way now." 

"How long have you been on 
leave?" 

"Since yesterday. I've been sitting here, waiting for you." 

"Yesterday!" I had spent yesterday giving kindergarten lectures to brasshats who did not 
want them. I stood up. "Don't 
move. I'll be right back." 

I rushed over to the operations 
office. Oldfield looked up when I 
came in and said in a surly tone, 
"What do you want?" 

"Chief, that series of bedtime 
stories I'm scheduled to tell — better cancel them." 

"Why?" 

"I'm a sick man ; I've rated 
sick leave for a long time. Now 
I've got to take it." 

"You're sick in the head/' 
"Thafs right, I'm sick in the 
head. I hear voices. People have 



been following me around. I keep 
dreaming I'm back with the titans." That last point was true. 

"But since when has being 
crazy been any handicap in this 
section?" He waited for me to 
argue the point. 

"Look, do I get leave or don't 
I?" 

He fumbled through papers, 
found one and tore it up. "Okay. 
Keep your phone handy; you're 
subject to recall. Get out." 

I got. Mary looked up when I 
came in and gave me the soft 
warm treatment again. I said, 
"Grab your things. We're leaving." 

She did not ask where; she 
simply stood up. I snatched my 
drink, gulped some and spilled 
the rest. We were up on the 
pedestrian level of the city before 
we spoke. Then I asked, "Where 
do you want to get married?" 

"Sam, we discussed that before." 

"Sure we did and now we are 
going to do it. Where?" 

"Sam, my very dear, I will do 
what you say. But I am still opft 
posed to it." 

"Why?" 

"Let's go to my apartment. I'd 
like to cook dinner for you." 

"Okay, you can cook dinner— 
but nof there. And we get married 
first." 

"Please, Sam!" 

Somebody said, "Keep pitch

ing, kid. She's weakening.** I 
looked around and found that we 
were playing to a gallery. 

I swept an arm wide and shouted irritably, "Haven't you people 
got anything to do? Go get 
drunk !" 

Somebody else said, "I'd say 
he ought to take her offer." 

I grabbed Mary's arm and did 
not say another word until I had 
gotten her into a cab. "All right," 
1 said gruffly, "let's have your 
reasons." 

"I*m yours; you don't need a 
contract, so why get married, 
Sam?" 

"Why? Because I love you, 
damn it! M 

She did not answer for quite a 
while. I thought I had offended 
her. When she did, I could hardly 
hear her. "You hadn't mentioned 
that before, Sam." 

"Hadn't I? Oh, I must have." 

"No, I'm quite sure you haven't. Why didn't you?" 

"An oversight, I guess. I'm not 
sure I know what the word 'love' 
means." 

"Neither am I," she said softly, 
"but I love to hear you say it. Say 
■ it again, please." 

"Huh? Okay. I love you. I 
love you, Mary." 

"Oh, Sam!" 

She snuggled against me and 
began to tremble. I shook her a 
little. "How about you?" 

"Me? Oh, I do love you, Sam. 



I've loved you ever since — '* 

"Ever since what?" 

I expected her to say that she 
had loved me ever since I took 
her place in "Project Interview." 
What she said was, "I've loved 
you ever since you slapped me." 

Now, is that logic? 

The driver was cruising slowly 
along the Connecticut coast; I 
had to wake him before I could 
get him to land in Westport. We 
went to the city hall. I stepped up 
to a counter in the bureau of 
sanctions and licenses and said to 
a clerk, "Is this where we get 
married?" 

"That's up to you," he answered. "Hunting licenses on the 
left, dog licenses on the right, this 
is the happy medium." 

"Good," I said stiffly. "Will you 
oblige by issuing a license?" 

"Sure. Everybody ought to get 
married at least once; that's what 
I tell my old lady." He got out a 
form. "Let's have your serial 
numbers." We gave them to him. 
"Either of you married in any 
other state?" We said we weren't. 
"You're sure? If you don't tell 
me, so I can put on a rider showing other contracts, this contract 
ain*t valid." 

We told him again that we 
weren't married anywhere. He 
went on, "Term, renewable, or 
lifetime? If it's over ten years, the 
fee is the same as for lifetime. If 
it's under six months, you get the 



|4« 




 



short form from that vendo machine over there." 

Mary said in a small voice, 
"Lifetime." 

The clerk looked surprised. 
"The renewable contract, with the 
automatic option clause, is just 
as permanent, and you don't have 
to go through the courts if you 

chnngc your mind." 

I said, "You heard the lady!" 

"Okay, okay. Either party, mutual consent, or binding?" 

"Binding," I answered, and 
Mary nodded. 

"Binding it is," he agreed, 
bending over the typer. "Now the 
meat of the matter: who pays and 
how much? Salary or endowment?" 

I said. "Salary." I didn't own 
enough to set up a fund. 

"Neither," Mary stated. "This 
is not a financial contract." 

The clerk stopped completely. 
"Lady, don't be foolish," he said 
reasonably. "You heard the gentleman say he was willing to do 
the right thing." 

"No." 

"Hadn't you better talk with 
your lawyer before you go ahead? 
There's a public communicator 
in the hall." 

"No!" 

"Well, I'm darned if I see what 
you need a license for." 

"Neither do I," Mary told him. 

"You mean you don't want 
this?" 



"No! Put it down the way I 
told you to. No salary." 

The clerk looked helpless but 
bent over the typer. "I guess 
thafs all," he said finally. "You've kept it simple, I'll say that. 
'Do -you - both - solemnly - swear that-the-above-facts-are-true-tothe-best-of-your-knowledge-andbelief-that-you-are-entering-intothis- agreement -uninfluenced -bydrugs - or - other - illegal - induce ments - and - that - there - exists - no undisclosed - covenants - nor-otherlegal- impediments- to- the -execution - and - registration - of - the above-contract?" 

We both said that we did and 
we were and it was and there 
weren't. He pulled it out of the 
typer. "Let's have your thumb 
prints. Okay, that'll be ten dollars, including federal tax." I paid 
him and he shoved the form into 
the copier and threw the switch. 
"Copies will be mailed to you," 
he announced, "at your serialnumber addresses. Now, what 
type of ceremony are you looking for? Maybe I can help." 

"As quick, plain and cheap as 
it can be," Mary told him. 

"Then I've got just what you 
want. Old Doctor Chamleigh. 
Non-sectarian, best stereo accompaniment in town, all four walls 
and full orchestra. He gives you 
the works, fertility rites and 
everything, but dignified. And he

from- the- shoulder word of advice. 
Makes you feel married." 

"No." This time I said it. 

"Come on!" the clerk said to 
me. "Think of the little lady. If 
she sticks by what she just swore 
to, she'll never have another 
chance. Every girl is entitled to a 
formal wedding. Honest, I don't 
get much of a commission." 

I said, "You can marry us, 
can't you? Go ahead. Get it over 
with!" 

He blinked at me. "Didn't you 
know? In this state you marry 
yourself. You've been married, 
ever since you thumbprinted the 
license." 

I said, "Oh." Mary didn't say 
anything. We left. 

I hired a duo at the landing 
flat north of town; the heap was 
ten years old, but it had fullautomatic and that was all that 
mattered. I looped around the 
City, cut across Manhattan Crater, and set the controls. I was 
happy though nervous — and then 
Mary put her arms around me. 
After a long time I heard the 
beeeep! beep-beep beeeep! of the 
beacon at my shack, whereupon 
I unwound myself and landed. 
Mary said sleepily. "Where are 
we?" 

"At my cabin in the mountains," I told her. 

"I didn't know you had a cabin 
in the mountains. I thought you 
were headed for my apartment.** 



"What, and risk those bear 
traps? Anyhow, it's not mine; it's 
ours." 

She kissed me again, which 
made me kind of louse up the 
landing. She slid out ahead of me 
while I was securing the board; I 
found her staring at the shack. 
"Sweetheart, it's beautiful!" 

"You can't beat the Adirondacks," I agreed. There was a 
slight haze with the sun low in 
the west, giving that wonderful 
depth -upon-depth stereo look. 

She glanced at it and said, 
"Yes, but I didn't mean that. I 
meant your — our — cabin. Let's 
go inside right now." 

"Suits," I agreed, "but it's really just a simple shack." Which it 
was. Not even an indoor pool. 
When I came up here, I didn't 
want to feel that I had brought 
the city with me. The shell was 
conventional steel and fiberglass, 
but I had had it veneered in duroslabs which looked like real logs. 
The inside was just as simple — a 
big living room with a real fireplace, deep rugs and plenty of 
low chairs. The services were in 
a Kompacto special, buried under 
the foundation — air-conditioner, 
power pack, cleansing system, 
sound equipment, plumbing, radiation alarm, servos — everything 
but deep-freeze and the other kitchen equipment, out of sight and 
mind. Even the stereo screens 
would not be noticed unless in 




 



use. It was about as near as a man 
could get to a real log cabin and 
still have a little comfort. 

"I think it's lovely," Mary said 
seriously. "I wouldn't want an 
ostentatious place." 

"You and me both." I worked 
the combo and the door dilated; 
Mary was inside at once. "Hey ! 
Come back!" I yelled. 

She did, looking puzzled. 
"What's the matter, Sam? Did I 
do something wrong?" 

"You sure did." I swung her 
up in my arms and carried her 
across the threshold, kissing her 
as I put her down. "There. Now 
you are in your own house, properly." 

The lights, of course, came on 
automatically as we entered. She 
looked around, then turned and 
threw her arms around my neck. 
"Oh, darling, darling!" 

We took time out. Then she 
started wandering around, touching things. "Sam, if I had planned 
it myself, it would have been just 
this way." 

"It has only one bathroom," I 
apologized. "We'll have to rough 
I it." 

"I don't mind. I'm glad; now 
I know you didn't bring any of 
those women of yours up here." 
i "What women?" 

"You know darn well. If you 
had been planning this as a nest, 
you would have included a powder room." 



"You know too much."* 

She did not answer but wandered out into the kitchen. I 
heard her squeal. 

"What's the matter?" I asked. 

"I never expected to find a real 
kitchen in a bachelor's lodge." 
t "I'm not a bad cook. I wanted 
a kitchen, so I bought one." 

"I'm glad. Now I will cook you 
dinner." 

"It's your kitchen; suit yourself. But don't you want to wash 
up? You can have first crack at 
the shower. Tomorrow we'll get 
a catalog and you can pick out 
a bathroom of your own. We'll 
have it flown in." 

"You take first shower," she 
said. "I want to start dinner." 

"[%/■: ARY and I slipped into domesticity as if we had been 
married for years. Oh, not that 
our honeymoon was humdrum, or 
that there weren't a thousand 
things we still had to learn about 
each other — the point was that 
we already seemed to know the 
necessary things about each other 
that made us married. Especially 
Mary. 

I don't remember those days 
too clearly. I was happy; I had 
forgotten what it was like, had 
not known that I was not happy. 
Interested, I used to be — diverted, entertained, amused — but 
not happy. 

We did not turn on a stereo or 



THE PUPPET MASTERS 



read a book, we saw no one and 
spoke to no one, except that on 
the second day we walked down 
to the village; I wanted to show 
Mary off. On the way back we 
passed the shack of John the 
Goat, our local hermit. John did 
what little caretaking I required. 

Seeing him, I waved. He waved 
back. He was dressed as usual, 
stocking cap, an old army blouse, 
shorts, and sandals. I thought of 
warning him about the bareto-the-waist order, but decided 
against it. Instead I cupped my 
hands and shouted, "Send up the 
Pirate!" 

"Who's the Pirate, darling?" 

"You'll see." 

As soon as we got back, the 
Pirate came in, for I had his little 
door keyed to his own meeow— 
the Pirate being a large and rakish tomcat. He strutted in, told 
me what he thought of people 
who stayed away so long, then 
head-bumped my ankle in forgiveness. After I roughed him up, 
he inspected Mary. She dropped 
to her knees and made the sounds 
used by people who- understand 
cat protocol, but the Pirate 
looked her over suspiciously. Suddenly he jumped into her arms 
and commenced to buzz, while 
bumping her under the chin. 

"That's a relief," I announced. 
"For a moment I didn't think I 
was going to be allowed to keep 
you." 



Mary looked up and smiled. 
"You need not have worried. I'm 
two-thirds cat myself." 

"What's the other third?" 

"You'll find out." 

From then on the cat was with 
us — or with Mary — almost all the 
time, except when I shut him out 
of our bedroom. That I would 
not stand for, though both Mary 
and the Pirate thought it small 
of me. 

MARY never borrowed trouble. 
She did not like digging into 
the past. She would let me talk 
about mine, but not about her 
own. Once when I started quizzing her, she changed the subject 
saying, "Let's look at the sunset." 

"Sunset?" I repeated. "Can't 
be. We just finished breakfast." 
The mixup about the time of day 
jerked me back to reality. "Mary, 
how long have we been up here?" 
"Does it matter?" 
"You bet it matters. It's been 
more than a week, I'm sure. One 
of these days our phones will 
start screaming and then it's back 
to the treadmill." 

"In the meantime, what difference does it make?" 

I still wanted to know what day 
it was. I could have found out 
by switching on a stereo, but I 
would probably have bumped into a newscast and I did not want 
that. I was still pretending that 
Mary and I were away in a different world, where titans did 
not exist. 

"Mary," I said fretfully, "how 
many tempus pills have you?" 

"None." 

"Well, I've got enough for us 
both, I suppose. Suppose we have 
just twenty-four more hours; we 
could stretch it out to a month, 
subjective time." 

"No." 

"Why not? Let's carpe that old 
diem." 

She put a hand on my arm and 
looked up into my eyes. "No, 
darling, it's not for me. I must 
live each moment and not let it 
be spoiled by worrying about the 
moment ahead." I looked stubborn. She went on, "If you want 
to take them, T won't mind, but 
please don't ask me to." 

"Confound it, I'm not going on 
a joy ride alone.'* She did not 
answer, which is the damnedest 
way of winning an argument. 

Not that we argued. If I tried 
to start one, Mary would give 
in and somehow it would work 
out that I was mistaken. I did 
try several times to find out more 
about her; it seemed to me that I 
ought to know something about 
the woman I was married to. To 
one question she looked thoughtful and answered* "I sometimes 
wonder . whether I ever did have 
a childhood — or was it something 
I dreamed last night?" 

I asked her pointblank what 



her name was. "Mary," she said 
tranquilly. 

"Mary really is your name?" 
I had long since told her my right 
name, but we went on using Sam. 

"Certainly it's my name, dear. 
I've been Mary since you first 
called me that." 

"Oh. All right, you are my beloved Mary. But what was your 
name before?" 

Her eyes held an odd, hurt 
look, but she answered steadily, 
"I was once known Allucquere." 

"Allucquere," I repeated, savoring it. "What a strange and 
beautiful name. My darling Allucquere." 

"My name is Mary now." And 
that was that. 

Somewhere, somewhen, I was 
convinced, Mary had been hurt, 
badly hurt. But it seemed unlikely that I was ever going to 
know about it. Presently I ceased 
to worry about it. She was what 
she was, and I was content to 
bask in the warm light of her 
presence. 

1WENT on calling her Mary, 
but the name that she had 
once kept running through my 
mind. I wondered how it was 
Spelled. 

Then suddenly I knew. My 
pesky packrat memory was pawing away at the shelves in the 
back of my mind where I keep 
the useless junk that I am unable 



155 



GALAXY SCIENCE "FICTION 



to get rid of. There had been a 
community, a colony that used 
an artificial language, even to 
given names — 

The Whitmanites, that was it. 
The anarchist- pari fist cult that 
got kicked out of Canada, then 
failed to make a go of it in Little 
America. There was a book written by their prophet, The Entropy oi Joy; it was full of 
pseudo - mathematical formulas 
for achieving happiness. 

Everybody is for "happiness," 
just as they are against "sin," but 
the cult's practices got them in 
hot water. They had a curious 



and very ancient solution to their 
sexual problems, a solution which 
produced explosive results when 
the Whitmanite culture touched 
any other pattern of behavior. 
Even Little America had not been 
far enough away. I had heard 
somewhere that the remnants had 
emigrated to Venus — in which 
case they must all be dead by 
this time. 

I put it out of my mind. If 
Mary were a Whitmanite, or had 
been reared that way, that was 
her business. I certainly was not 
going to let the cult's philosophy 
cause us a crisis now or ever; 
marriage Is not ownership and 
wives are not property. 

XXII 

THE next time I mentioned 
tempus pills, she did not argue but suggested that we hold 
it down to a minimum dose. It 
was a fair compromise — we could 
always take more. 

I prepared it as injections so 
that it would take hold faster. 
Ordinarily I watch a clock after 
I've taken tempus; when the second hand slows to a stop, I know 
I'm loaded. But my shack has no 
clocks and neither of us was bothering with ringwatches. It was 
sunrise and we had been awake 
all night, cuddled up on a big 
low couch by the fireplace. 

We continued to lie there, feeling good and dreamy, and I was 
considering the idea that the drug 
had not worked. Then I realized 
that the sun had stopped rising. 
I watched a bird fluttering past 
the window. If I stared at him 
long enough, I could see his wings 
move. 

I looked back from it to my 
wife. The Pirate was curled up 
on her stomach, his paws tucked 
in as a muff. They seemed asleep. 
"How about breakfast?'* I said. 
*Tm starved." 

"You get it," she answered. "If 
I move, 1*11 disturb Pirate." 

"You promised to love, honor, 



and fix me breakfast," I replied 
and tickled her feet. She gasped 
and drew up her legs; the cat 
squawked and landed on the floor. 

"Oh, dear!" she said. "You 
made me move too fast." 

"Never mind the cat, woman; 
you're married to me." E«t I 
knew that I had made a mistake. 
In the presence of people not under the drug, one should move 
with great care. I simply hadn't 
thought about the cat; no doubt 
he thought we were behaving like 
drunken jumping jacks. I intentionally slowed down and tried 
to woo him. 

No use — he was streaking toward his door. I could have stopped him, for to me his movement 
was a molasses crawl, but had I 
done so I would have frightened 
him more. I let him go. 

Do you know, Mary was right? 
Tempus-fugit drug is no good for 
honeymoons. The ecstatic happiness I had felt before was masked 
by the euphoria of the drug. I 
had substituted a chemical fake 
for the true magic. Nevertheless 
it was a good day — or month. But 
I wished that I had stuck to the 
real thing. 

Late that evening we came out 
of it. I felt the slight irritability 
which marks the loosening hold 
of the drug, found my ringwatch 
and timed my reflexes. When they 
were back to normal I timed 
Mary's, whereupon she informed 



154 




 



me that she had been out of it 
for twenty minutes or so — pretty 
accurate matching of dosage. 

"Do you want to go under 
again?" she asked. 

I kissed her. "No. Frankly, I'm 
glad to be back." 

"I'm so glad." 
t I had the usual ravenous ap
petite that one has afterward; 
I mentioned it. "In a minute," she 
said. "I want to call Pirate." 

I had not missed him; the 
euphoria is like that. "Don't worry." I told her. "He often stays 
out all day." 

"He never has before." 

"He has with me," I answered. 



"I think I offended him. I know 
I did." 

"He's probably down at Old 
John's. That's his usual way of 
punishing me. He'll be all right.'* 

"But it's late at night — I 'm 
afraid a fox might get him. Do 
you mind, darling? I'll just step 
out and call him." She headed for 
the door. 

"Put something on," I suggested. "It will be nippy out." 

She went back to the bedroom 
and got a negligee I had bought 
for her the day we had gone to 
the village. She went out. I put 
wood on the fire and ambled into 
the kitchen. While I was trying 

to make up my mind about a had. and I had at! I could do

penguins!'* She did not answer 
and I did not hear the door relax, 
so I went back into the living 
room. She was just coming in 
and did not have the cat with 
her. I started to speak and then 
caught sight of her eyes. They 
were staring, filled with unspeakable horror. 

I said, "Mary!" and started toward her. She seemed to see me 
and turned back toward the door; 
her movements were jerky, spasmodic. Then I saw her shoulders. 
Under the negligee was a hump. 
I don't know how long I stood 
there. Probably a split second, 
but it is burned into me as endless. I jumped and grabbed her 
by the arms. She looked at me 
and her eyes were no longer wells 
of horror but merely dead. 
She gave me the knee. 
I squeezed and managed to 
avoid the worst of it. Look, you 
don't tackle a dangerous opponent by grabbing his arms, but 
this was my wife. I couldn't come 
at Mary with a feint-shift-andfciU, 

But the slug had no compunctions about me. Mary— or if— 
was me everything she

I let go with one hand and Mary on top. I shoved my head

did. T was lucky that I was not 
myself paralyzed. 

There was one thing left that 
I could do: clutch the slug. But 
I knew the shattering effect that 
had on the host. It might kilt 
her; it was sure to hurt her horribly. I wanted to make her unconscious, then remove the slug 
gently before I killed it . . . drive 
it off with heat or force it to 
turn loose with mild shocks. 
Drive it off with heat — 
I was given no time to develop 
the idea; she got her teeth in 
my ear. I shifted my right arm 
and grabbed at the slug. 

NOTHING happened. Instead 
of my fingers sinking into it, 
I found that this slug had a leathery covering. It was as if I had 
clutched a football! Mary jerked 
when I touched it and took away 
part of my ear, but there was no 
bone-crushing spasm; the slug 
was still alive and in control. 

I tried to get my fingers under 
it It clung like a suction cup. 
My fingers would not go under. 

In the meantime I was suffering damages in other places. I 
rolled over and got to my knees, 
still hugging her. I had to let her 
legs free and that was bad, but 
I bent her across a hip and strugr 
gled to my feet. , 
I dragged and , carried, her to 
the fireplace. ■ , 

She, almost got . away i from me ; 



it was like wrestling a mountain 
lion. But I got her there, grabbed 
her mop of hair and slowly forced 
her shoulders over the fire. 

I meant only to singe the slug, 
force it to drop off to escape that 
heat. But she struggled so hard 
that I slipped, banging my own 
head against the arch of the 
opening and dropping her shoulders against the coals. 

She screamed and bounded out 
of the fire, carrying me with her. 
I struggled to my feet, still dazed 
by the wallop, and saw her collapsed on the floor. Her beautiful 
hair and her negligee were burning! 

I slapped at them both with 
my hands. The slug was no longer 
on her. Still crushing the flames 
with my hands, I glanced around 
and saw it lying on the floor by 
the fireplace — and the Pirate was 
sniffing at it. 

"Get away from there !" I 
yelled. "Pirate! Stop that!" 

The cat looked up inquiringly. 
I went on making certain that the 
fire was out. When I was sure, I 
left her; there was not even time 
to see if she was still alive. What 
I wanted was the fireplace shovel; 
I did not dare risk touching the 
thing with my hands. I turned to 
get it. 

i But the slug was no longer on 
the floor; it had gotten Pirate. 
The cat was standing rigid, feet 
wide apart, and the slug was set^ 



G A L A X, V SCIENCE FICTION 



tling into place. I dived at Pirate 
and got him by his hind legs just 
as he made his first possessed 
movement. 

Handling a frenzied cat with 
bare hands is reckless at best; 
controlling one which is already 
controlled by a titan is impossible. Hands and arms being 
slashed by claws and teeth at 
every step, I hurried to the fireplace again. Despite Pirate's wails 
and struggles, I forced the slug 
against the coals and held it there, 
cat fur and my hands alike burning, until the slug dropped off 
directly into the flames. Then I 
took Pirate out and laid him on 
the floor. He was no longer struggling. I made sure that he was 
no longer burning anywhere, and 
went back to Mary. 

She was still unconscious. I 
squatted down beside her and 
sobbed. 

AN hour later I had done what 
I could for Mary. Her hair 
was gone from the left side of 
her head and there were burns 
on shoulders and neck. But her 
pulse was strong, her respiration 
steady, though fast and light, and 
I did not judge that she would 
lose much body fluid. I dressed 
her burns — I keep a full stock of 
medical stuff out there in the 
country — and gave her an injection to make her sleep. Then I 
had time for Pirate. 



He was still where I had left 
him and he did not look good. 
He had gotten it much worse 
than Mary and probably flame 
in his lungs as well. He was lying so still, I thought he was 
dead, but he lifted his head when 
I touched him. 

"I'm sorry, old fellow," I whispered. I think I heard him mew. 

I did for him what I had done 
for Mary, except that I was 
afraid to give him a soporific. 
After that I went into the bathroom and looked myself over 
carefully. 

The ear had stopped bleeding; 
I decided to ignore it. My hands 
were what bothered me. I stuck 
them under hot water and yelped, 
then dried them in the air blast 
and that hurt, too. I could not 
figure out how I could dress them, 
and, besides, I needed to use 
them. 

Finally I dumped about an 
ounce of the jelly for burns into 
each of a pair of plastic gloves 
and put them on. The stuff included a local anesthetic ; that 
would help me get by. Then I 
went to the stereophone and 
called the village medical man. 
I explained what had happened 
and what 1 had done about it and 
asked him to please come up at 
once. 

"At night?" he said. "You must 
be joking." 

I said that the hell I was.

He answered, "Don't ask the 
impossible, man. Yours makes 
the fourth alarm in this county; 
nobody goes out at night. I'll

Off. 

Pirate died a little after mid


night. I buried him at once so 
that Mary would not see him. 
Digging hurt my hands, but he 
did not need a very big hole. 
I said good-by to him and came 
back in. Mary was resting quietly; I brought a chair to the 
bed and watched over her. Probably I dozed from time to time; 
I can't be sure.
