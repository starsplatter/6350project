SAUCER OF LONELINESS By THEODORE STURGEON 

IF she's dead, I thought, I'll 
never find her in this white 
flood of moonlight on the 
white sea, with the surf seething 
in and over the pale, pale sand 
like a great shampoo. Almost 
always, suicides, who stab themselves or shoot themselves in the 
heart carefully bare their chests; 
the same strange impulse generally makes the sea-suicide go 
naked. 

A little earlier, I thought, or 
later, and there would be shadows for the dunes and the breathing toss of the foam. Now the 
only real shadow was mine, a 
tiny thing just under me, but 
black enough to feed the blackness of the shadow of a blimp. 

A Jittle earlier, I thought, and 
I might have seen her plodding 
up the silver shore, seeking a 
place lonely enough to die in. A 
little later and my legs would 
rebel against this shuffling trot 
through sand, the maddening 
sand that could not hold and 
would not help a hurrying man. 

My legs did give way then and 
I knelt suddenly, sobbing — not 
for her; not yet — just for air. 
There was such a rush about me: 
wind, and tangled spray, and 
colors upon colors and shades of 
colors that were not colors at all 
but shifts of white and silver. If 
light like that were sound, it 
would sound like the sea on sand, 
and if my ears were eyes, they 





would see such a light. 

I crouched there, gasping in 
the swirl of it, and a flood struck 
me, shallow and swift, turning 
up and outward like flower petals 
where it touched my knees, then 
soaking me to the waist in its 
bubble and crash. I pressed my 
knuckles to my eyes so they 
would open again. The sea was 
on my lips with the taste of tears 
and the whole white night shoutAnd there she was. 

HER white shoulders were a 
taller curve in the sloping 
foam. She must have sensed me 


— perhaps I yelled — for she turned and saw me kneeling there. 
She put her fists to her temples 
and her face twisted, and she 
uttered a piercing wail of despair 
and fury, and then plunged seaward and sank. 

I kicked off my shoes and ran 
into the breakers, shouting, hunting, grasping at flashes of white 
that turned to sea-salt and coldness in my fingers. I plunged 
right past her, and her body 
struck my side as a wave whipped my face and tumbled both 
of us. I gasped in solid water, 
opened my eyes beneath the surface and saw a greenish -white 
distorted moon hurtle as I spun. 
Then there was sucking sand under my feet again and my left 
hand was tangled in her hair. 

The receding wave towed her 
away and for a moment she 
streamed out from my hand like 
steam from a whistle. In that 
moment I was sure she was dead, 
but as she settled to the sand, 
she fought and scrambled to her 
feet. 

She hit my ear, wet, hard, and 
a huge pointed pain lanced into 
my head. She pulled, she lunged 
away from me, and all the while 
my hand was caught in her hair. 
I couldn't have freed her if I had 
wanted to. She spun to me with 
the next .wave, battered and 
clawed at me, and we went into 
deeper water. 



"Don't . . . don't ... I can't 
swim!" I shouted, so she clawed 
me again. 

"Leave me alone," she shrieked. "Oh, dear God, why can't 
you leave" (said her fingernails) 
"me . . ." (said her snapping 
teeth) "a/one/" (said her small 
hard fist). 

So by her hair I pulled her 
head down tight to her white 
shoulder; and with the edge of 
my free hand I hit her neck 
twice. She floated again, and I 
brought her ashore. 

I carried her to where a dune 
was between us and the sea's 
broad noisy tongue, and the wind 
was above us somewhere. But 
the light was as bright. I rubbed 
her wrists and- stroked her face 
and said, "It's all right," and, 
"There!" and some names I used 
to have for a dream I had long, 
long before I ever heard of her. 

She lay still on her back with 
the breath hissing between her 
teeth, with her lips in a smile 
which her twisted -tight, wrinklesealed eyes made not a smile but 
a torture. She was well and conscious for many moments and 
still her breath hissed and her 
closed eyes twisted. 

"Why couldn't you leave me 
alone?" she asked at last. She 
opened her eyes and looked at 
me. She had so much misery 
that there was no room for fear. 
She shut her eyes again and said.

"You know who I am." 
"I know," I said. 
She began to cry. 

T WAITED, and when she 
stopped crying, there were 
shadows among the dunes. A long 
time. 

She said, "You don't know 
who I am. Nobody knows who 
I am." 

I said, "It was in all the 
papers." 

"That!" She opened her eyes 
slowly and her gaze traveled over 
my face, my shoulders, stopped 
at my mouth, touched my eyes 
for the briefest second. She 
curled her lips and turned away 
her head. "Nobody knows who 
I am." 

I waited for her to move or 
speak, and finally I said "Tell 
me." 

"Who are you?" she asked, 
with her head still turned away. 
"Someone who . . ." 
"Well?" 

"Not now," I said* "Later, 
maybe." 

She sat up suddenly and tried 
to hide herself. "Where are my 
clothes?" 

"I didn't see them." 

"Oh," she said. "I remember. 
I put them down and kicked 
sand over them, just where a 
dune would come and smooth 
them over, hide them as if they 
never were ... I hate sand. I 



wanted to drown in the sand, but 
it wouldn't let me . . . You 
mustn't look at me!" she shouted. 
"I hate to have you looking at 
me!" She threw her head from 
side to side, seeking. "I can't 
stay here like this! What can I 
do? Where can I go?" 
"Here," I said. 

She let me help her up and 
then snatched her hand away, 
half-turned from me. "Don't 
touch me. Get away from me." 

"Here," I said again, and 
walked down the dune where it 
curved in the moonlight, tipped 
back into the wind and down 
and became not dune but beach. 
"Here." I pointed behind the 
dune. 

At last she followed me. She 
peered over the dune where it 
was chest-high, and again where 
it was knee-high. "Back there?" 

I nodded. 

"I didn't see them." 

"So dark . . ." She stepped 
over the low dune and into the 
aching black of those moonshadows. She moved away cautiously, feeling tenderly with her 
feet, back to where the dune was 
higher. She sank down into the 
blackness and disappeared there. 
I sat on the sand in the light. 
"Stay away from me," she spat. 

I rose and stepped back. Invisible in the shadows, she 
breathed, "Don't go away." I 
waited, then saw her hand press 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS 



out of the clean-cut shadows. 
"There," she said, "over there. 
In the dark. Just be a . . . Stay 
away from me now . . . Be a — 
voice." 

I did as she asked, and sat in 
the shadows perhaps six feet 
from her. 

She told me about it. Not the 
way it was in the papers. 

SHE was perhaps seventeen 
when it happened. She was 
in Central Park, in New York. It 
was too warm for such an early 
spring day, and the hammered 
brown slopes had a dusting 
of green of precisely the consistency of that morning's hoar 
frost on the rocks. But the frost 
was gone and the grass was brave 
and tempted some hundreds of 
pairs of feet from the asphalt and 
concrete to tread on it. 

Hers were among them. The 
sprouting soil was a surprise to 
her feet, as the air was to her 
lungs. Her feet ceased to be shoes 
as she walked, her body was 
consciously more than clothes. It 
was the only kind of day which 
in itself can make a city-bred 
person raise his eyes. She did. 

For a moment she felt separated from the life she lived, in 
which there was no fragrance,, no 
silence, in which nothing ever 
quite fit nor was quite filled. In 
that moment the ordered disapproval of the buildings around 



the pallid park could not reach 
her; for two, three clean breaths 
it no longer mattered that the 
whole wide world really belonged 
to images projected on a screen; 
to gently groomed goddesses in 
these steel and glass towers; that 
it belonged, in short, always, always to someone else. 

So she raised her eyes, and 
there above her was the saucer. 

It was beautiful. It was golden, with a dusty finish like that 
of an unripe concord grape. It 
made a faint sound, a chord composed of two tones and a blunted 
hiss like the wind in tall wheat. 
It was darting about like a swallow, soaring and dropping. It circled and dropped and hovered 
like a fish, shimmering. It was 
like all these living things, but 
with that beauty it had all the 
loveliness of things' turned and 
burnished, measured, machined, 
and metrical. 

At first she felt no astonishment, for this was so different 
from anything 'she had ever seen 
before that it had to be a trick 
of the eye, a false evaluation of 
size and speed and distance that 
in a moment would resolve itself 
into a sun-flash on an airplane 
or the lingering glare of a welding arc. 

She looked away from it and 
abruptly realized that many 
other people saw it — saw something — too. People all around her 



54 




 



had stopped moving and speaking and were craning upward. 
Around her was a globe of silent 
astonishment, and outside it she 
was aware of the life-noise of the 
city, the hard-breathing giant 
who never inhales. 

She looked up again, and at 
last began to realize how large 
and how far away the saucer 
was. No: rather, how small and 
how very near it was. It was just 
the size of the largest circle she 
might make with her two hands, 
and it floated not quite eighteen 
inches over her head. 

¥7*EAR came then. She drew 
back and raised a forearm, 
but the saucer simply hung there. 
She bent far sideways, twisted 
away, leaped forward, looked 
back and upward to see if she 
had escaped it. At first she couldn't see it; then as she looked up 
and up, there it was, close and 
gleaming, quivering and crooning, right over her head. 

She bit her tongue. 

From the corner of her eye, 
she saw a man cross himself. 
We did that because he saw me 
standing here with a halo over 
my head, she thought. And that 
was the greatest single thing that 
had ever happened to her. No 
one had ever looked at her and 
made a respectful gesture before, 
not once, not ever. Through terror, through panic and wonder


ment, the comfort of that thought 
nestled into her, to wait to be 
taken out and looked at again 
in lonely times. 

The terror was uppermost now, 
however. She backed away, staring upward, stepping a ludicrous 
Cakewalk. She should have collided with people. There were 
plenty of people there, gaping 
and craning, but she reached 
none. She spun around and discovered to her horror that she 
was the center of a pointing, 
pressing crowd. Its mosaic of 
eyes all bulged and its inner 
circle braced its many legs to 
press back and away from her. 

The saucer's gentle note deepened. It tilted, dropped an inch 
or so. Someone screamed, and 
the crowd broke away from her 
in all directions, milled about, 
and settled again in a new dynamic balance, a much larger 
ring, as more and more people 
raced to thicken it against the 
efforts of the inner circle to 
escape. 

The saucer hummed and tilted, 
tilted . . . 

She opened her mouth to 
scream, fell to her knees, and the 
saucer struck. 

It dropped against her forehead and clung there. It seemed 
almost to lift her. She came erect 
on her knees, made one effort to 
raise her hands against it. and 
then her arms stiffened down and

back, her hands not reaching the 
ground. For perhaps a second 
and a half the saucer held her 
rigid, and then it passed a single 
ecstatic quiver to her body and 
dropped it. She plumped to the 
ground, the backs of her thighs 
heavy and painful on her heels 
and ankles. 

The saucer dropped beside her, 
rolled once in a small circle, once 
just around its edge, and lay 
still. It lay still and dull and 
metallic, different and dead. 

HAZILY, she lay and gazed 
at the gray-shrouded blue of 
the good spring sky, and hazily 
she heard whistles. 

And some tardy screams. 
And a great stupid voice bellowing "Give her air!" which 
made everyone press closer. 

Then there wasn't so much sky 
because of the blue-clad bulk 
with its metal buttons and its 
leatherette notebook. '*Okay , 
okay, what's happened here stand 
back figods sake." 

And the widening ripples of 
observation, interpretation and 
comment: "It knocked her 
down." "Some guy knocked her 
down." "He knocked her down." 
Some guy knocked her down 
and — " "Right in broad daylight 
this guy . . ," "The park's gettin' 
to be . . ." onward and outward, 
the adulteration of fact until it 
was lost altogether because ex


citement is so much more important. 

Somebody with harder a shoulder than the rest bulling close, a 
notebook here, too, a witnessing 
eye over it, ready to change ". . . 
a beautiful brunet . . ." to "an 
attractive brunet" for the afternoon editions, because "attractive" is as dowdy as any woman 
is allowed to get if she is a victim 
in the news. 

The glittering shield and the 
florid face bending close: "You 
hurt bad, sister?" And the 
echoes, back and back through 
the crowd, "Hurt bad, hurt bad. 
badly injured, he beat the hell 
out of her, broad daylight . . ." 

And still another man, slim 
and purposeful, tan gabardine, 
cleft chin and beard-shadow : 
"Flyin' saucer, hm? Okay, Officer, I'll take over here." 

"And who the hell might you 
be. takin' over?" 

The flash of a brown leather 
wallet, a face so close behind that 
its chin was pressed into the 
gabardine shoulder. The face 
said, awed: "F.B.I." and that 
rippled outward, too. The policeman nodded— the entire policeman nodded in one single bobbing genuflection. 

"Get some help and clear this 
area," said the gabardine. 

"Yes, sir/" said the policeman. 

"F. B. I., F. B. I.," the crowd 
murmured and there was more 



56 




 



sky to look at above her. 

She sat up and there was a 
glory in her face. "The saucer 
talked to me," she sang. 

"You shut up," said the gabardine. "You'll^ have lots of 
chance to talk later." 

"Yeah, sister," said the policeman. "My God. this mob could 
be full of Communists." 

"You shut up, too," said the 
gabardine. 

Someone in the crowd told 
someone else a Communist beat 
up this girl, while someone else 
was saying she got beat up because she was a Communist. 

SHE started to rise, but solicitous hands forced her down 
again. There were thirty police 
there by that time. 

"I can walk," she said. 
"Now you just take it easy," 
they told her. 

They put a stretcher down beside her and lifted her onto it 
and covered her with a big 
blanket. 

"I can walk," she said as they 
carried her through the crowd. 

A woman went white and 
turned away moaning, "Oh, my 
God, how awful!" 

A small man with round eyes 
stared and stared at her and 
licked and licked his lips. 

The ambulance. They slid her 
in. The gabardine was already 
there. 



A white-coated man with very 
clean hands: "How did it happen, miss?" 

"No questions," said the gabardine. "Security." 

The hospital. 

She said, "I got to get back to 
work." 

"Take your clothes off," they 
told her. 

She had a bedroom to herself 
then for the first time in her life. 
Whenever the door opened, she 
could see a policeman outside. 
It opened very often to admit 
the kind of civilians who were 
very polite to military people, 
and the kind of military people 
who were even more polite to 
certain civilians. She did not 
know what they all did nor what 
they wanted. Every single day 
they asked her four million five 
hundred thousand questions. Apparently they never talked to 
each other because each of them 
asked her the same questions 
over and over. 

"What is your name?" 

"How old are you?" 

"What year were you born?" 

"What is your name?" 

Sometimes they would push 
her down strange paths with 
their questions. 

"Now your uncle. Married a 
woman from Middle Europe, did 
he? Where in Middle Europe?" 

"What clubs or fraternal organizations did you belong to?

Ah! Now about that Rinkeydinks 
gang on 63rd Street. Who was 
rePHy behind it?" 

But over and over again, 
"What did you mean when you 
said the saucer talked to you?" 

And she would say, "It talked 
to me." 

And they would say, "And it 
said — " 

And she would shake her head. 

There would be a lot of shouting ones, and then a lot of kind 
oiies. No one had ever been so 
kind to her before, but she soon 
learned that no one was being 
kind to her. They were just getting her to relax, to think of 
other things, so they could sudd*nly shoot that question at her: 
"What do you mean it talked to 
yOU?" 

PRETTY soon it was just like 
Mom's or school or any place, 
and she used to sit with her 
niouth closed and let them yell. 
Once they sat her on a hard chair 
for hours and hours with a light 
iii her eyes and let her get thirsty. 
Home, there was a transom over 
tlie bedroom door and Mom used 
to leave the kitchen light glaring 
through it all night, every night, 
so she wouldn't get the horrors, 
go the light didn't bother her at 

They took her out of the hospital and put her in jail. Some 
^ays it was good. The food. The 



bed was all right, too. Through 
the window she could see lots of 
women exercising in the yard. It 
was explained to her that they 
all had much harder beds. 

"You are a very important 
young lady, you know." 

That was nice at first, but as 
usual it turned out they didn't 
mean her at all. They kept working on her. Once they brought 
the saucer in to her. It was inside 
a big wooden crate with a padlock, and a steel box inside that 
with a Yale lock. It only weighed 
a couple of pounds, the saucer, 
but by the time they got it packed, it took two men to carry it 
and four men with guns to 
watch them. 

. They made her act out the 
whole thing just the way it happened, with some soldiers holding the saucer over her head. It 
wasn't the same. They'd cut a 
lot of chips and pieces out of the 
saucer and, besides, it was that 
dead gray color. They asked her 
if she knew anything about that 
and for once she told them. 

"It's empty now," she said. 

The only one she would ever 
talk to was a little man with a 
fat belly who said to her the first 
time he was alone with her, 
"Listen, I think the way they've 
been treating you stinks. Now 
get this: I have a job to do. My 
job is to find out why you won't 
tell what the saucer said. I don't 



J8 




 



want to know what it said and 
111 never ask you. I don't even 
want you to tell me. Let's just 
find out why you'ic' keeping it a 
secret." 

Finding out why turned out to 
be hours of just talking about 
having pneumonia and the flower 
pot she made in second grade 
that Mom threw down the fire 
escape and getting left back in 
school and the dream about holding a wine glass in both hands 
and peeping over it at some man. 

And one day she told him why 
she wouldn't say about the saucer, just the way it came to her: 
"Because it was talking to me, 
and it's just nobody else's business." 

She even told him about the 
man crossing himself that day. It 
was the only other thing she had 
of her own. 

He was nice. He was the one 
who warned her about the trial. 
"I have no business saying this, 
but they're going to give you the 
full dress treatment. Judge and 
jury and all. You just say what 
you want to say, no less and no 
more, hear? And don't let 'em 
get your goat. You have a right 
to own something." 

He got up and swore and left. 

¥TMRST a man came and talked 
*■ to her for a long time about 
how maybe this Earth would be 
attacked from outer space by 



beings much stronger and cleverer than we are, and maybe she 
had the key to a defense. So she 
owed it to the whole world. And 
then even if the Earth wasn't attacked, just think of what an advantage she might give this 
country over its enemies. Then 
he shook his finger in her face 
and said that what she was doing 
amounted to working for the 
enemies of her country. And he 
turned out to be the man that 
was defending her at the trial. 

The jury found her guilty of 
contempt of court and the judge 
recited a long list of penalties he 
could give her. He gave her one 
of them and suspended it. They 
put her back in >ail for a 'few 
more days, and one fine day they 
turned her loose. 

That was wonderful at first. 
She got a job in a restaurant and 
a furnished room. She had been 
in the papers so much that Mom 
didn't want her back home. Mom 
was drunk most of the time and 
sometimes used to tear up the 
whole neighborhood, but all the 
same she had very special ideas 
about being respectable, and being in the papers all the time for 
spying was not her idea of being 
decent. So she put her maiden 
name on the mailbox downstairs 
and told her daughter not to live 
there any more. 

At the restaurant she met a 
man who asked her for a date. 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS 



59 



The first time. She spent every 
cent she had on a red handbag 
to go with her red shoes. They 
weren't the same shade, but anyway they were both red. They 
went to the movies and afterward he didn't try to kiss her or 
anything, he just tried to find out 
what the flying saucer told her. 
She didn't say anything. She 
went home and cried all night. 

Then some men sat in a booth 
talking and they shut up and 
glared at her every time she 
came past. They spoke to the 
boss, and he came and told her 
that they were electronics engineers working for the government and they were afraid to 
talk shop while she was around 
— wasn't she some sort of spy or 
something? So she got fired. 

Once she saw her name on a 
juke box. She put in a nickel and 
punched that number, and the 
record was all about "the flyin' 
saucer came down one day, and 
taught her a brand new way to 
play, and what it was I will not 
say, but she took me out of this 
world." And while she was listening to it, someone in the jukejoint recognized her and called 
her by name. Four of them followed her home and she had to 
block the door shut. 

SOMETIMES she'd be all 
right for months on end. and 
then someone would ask for a 



date. Three times out of five, she 
and the date were followed. Once 
the man she was with arrested 
the man who was tailing them. 
Twice the man who was tailing 
them arrested the man she was 
with. Five times out of five, the 
date would try to find out about 
the saucer. Sometimes she would 
go out with someone and pretend 
that it was a real date, but she 
wasn't very good at it. 

So she moved to the shore and 
got a job cleaning at night in offices and stores. There weren't 
many to clean, but that just 
meant there weren't many people 
to remember her face from the 
papers. Like clockwork, every 
eighteen months, some feature 
writer would drag it all out again 
in a magazine or a Sunday supplement; and every time anyone 
saw a headlight on a mountain or 
a light on a weather balloon it 
had to be a flying saucer, and 
there had to be some tired quip 
about the saucer wanting to tell 
secrets. Then for two or three 
weeks she'd stay off the streets 
in the daytime. 

Once she thought she had it 
whipped. People didn't want her, 
so she began reading. The novels were all right for a while 
until she found out that most of 
them were like the movies — all 
about the pretty ones who really 
own the world. So she learned 
things — animals, trees. A lousy 



60 




 



little chipmunk caught in a wire 
fence bit her. The animals didn't 
want her. The trees didn't care. 

Then she hit on the idea of the 
bottles. She got all the bottles she 
could and wrote on papers which 
she corked into the bottles. She'd 
tramp miles up and down the 
beaches and throw the bottles out 
as far as she could. She knew 
that if the right person found 
one, it would give that person 
the only thing in the world that 
would help. Those bottles kept 
her going for three solid years. 
Everyone's got to have a secret 
little something he does. 

And at last the time came 
when it was no use any more. 
You can go on trying to help 
someone who maybe exists; but 
soon you can't pretend there is 
such a person any more. And 
that's it. The end. 

" A RE you cold?" I asked when 
she was through telling me. 

The surf was quieter and the 
shadows longer. 

"No," she answered from the 
shadows. Suddenly she said, "Did 
you think I was mad at you because you saw me without my 
clothes?" 

"Why shouldn't you be?" 

"You know, I don't care? I 
wouldn't have wanted . . . wanted 
you to see me even in a ball gown 
or overalls. You can't cover up 
my carcass. It shows; it's there 



whatever. I just didn't 'want you 
to see me. At all." 

"Me, or anyone?" 

She hesitated. "You." 

I got up and stretched and 
walked a little, thinking. "Didn't 
the F.B.I, try to stop you throwing those bottles?" 

"Oh, sure. They spent I don't 
know how much taxpayers' 
money gathering 'em up. They 
still make a spot check every 
once in a while. They're getting 
tired of it, though. All the writing 
in the bottles is the same." She 
laughed, I didn't know she could. 

"What's funny?" 

"All of 'em — judges, jailers, 
juke-boxes — people. Do you 
know it wouldn't have saved me 
a minute's trouble if I'd told 'em 
the whole thing at the very beginning?" 

"No?" 

"No. They wouldn't have believed me. What they wanted was 
a new weapon. Super-science 
from a super-race, to slap hell 
out of the super-race if they ever 
got a chance, or out of our own 
if they don't. All those brains," 
she breathed, with more wonder 
than scorn, "alt that brass. They 
think 'super-race' and it comes 
out 'super- science.' Don't they 
ever imagine a super-race has 
super- feelings, too — super-laughter, maybe, or super-hunger?" 
She paused. "Isn't it time you 
asked me what the saucer said?" 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS 



61 



"I'll tell you," I blurted. 

"There is in certain living souls 
A quality of loneliness unspeakable. 

So great it must be shared 
As company is shared oy fosse r 
beings. 

Such a loneliness is mine; so know 

by this 
That in immensity 
There is one lonelier than you." 

"Dear Jesus," she said devoutly, and began to weep. "And how 
is it addressed?" 

"To the loneliest one . . ." 

"How did you know?" she 
whispered. 

"It's what you put in the bottles, isn't it?" 

"Yes," she said. "Whenever it 
gets to be too much, that no one 
cares, that no one ever did . . . 
you throw a bottle into the sea, 
and out goes a part of your own 
loneliness. You sit and think of 
someone somewhere finding it 
. . . learning for the first time that 
the worst there is can be understood." 

The moon was setting and the 
surf was hushed. We looked up 
and out to the stars. She said, 
"We don't know what loneliness 
is like. People thought the saucer 
was a saucer, but it wasn't. It was 
a bottle with a message inside. It 
had a bigger ocean to cross — all 
of space — and not much chance 
of finding anybody. Loneliness? 
We don't know loneliness." 

When I could, I asked her why 



she had tried to kill herself. 

"I've had it good," she said, 
"with what the saucer told me. 
I wanted to . . . pay back. I was 
bad enough to be helped; I had 
to know I was good enough to 
help. Wo one wants me? Fine. 
But don't tell me no one, anywhere, wants my help. I can't 
stand that." 

I took a deep breath. "I found 
one of your bottles two years 
ago. I've been looking for you 
ever since. Tide charts, current 
tables, maps and . . . wandering. 
I heard some _talk about you and 
the bottles hereabouts. Someone 
told me you'd quit doing it, you'd 
taken to wandering the dunes at 
night. I knew why. I ran all the 
way." 

I needed another breath now. 
"I got a club foot. I think right, 
but the words don't come out of 
my mouth the way they're inside 
my head. I have this nose. I never 
had a woman. Nobody ever 
wanted to hire me to work where 
they'd have to look at me. You're 
beautiful," I said. "You're beautiful." 

She said nothing, but it was as 
if a light came from her, more 
light and far less shadow than 
ever the practiced moon could 
cast. Among the many things it 
meant was that even to loneliness there is an end, for those who 
are lonely enough, long enough.
