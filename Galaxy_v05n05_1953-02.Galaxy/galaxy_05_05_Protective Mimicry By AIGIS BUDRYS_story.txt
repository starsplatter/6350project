Protective Mimicry By AIGIS BUDRYS 

THE strip of indestructible 
fiber goes into a slot in 
one end of the machine. It 
passes between rollers, dips into 
chemical baths, is stamped, dyed, 
analyzed for flaws, and then run 
through a unit which is detached 
from the main body of the machine every night and locked in 
a guarded vault. Finally, the strip 
emerges, is chopped into convenient lengths, and delivered into a 
bin, from which it is carefully 
moved into armored cars and distributed. It is known as money. 

Besides being non-defaceable, 
fireproof, immune to wear, 
weather and water, it has also 
had an electronic pattern impressed into the fiber by that topsecret unit. When you spend it, 
it is passed over a simple plate 
that reads the pattern. If serial 
number and pattern match, nothing happens. But if what you're 
presenting as legal tender is 
homemade, so many bells go off 
you'd think you were in a penny 
arcade. The engraving, the chemical composition of the ink, and 
the fiber are difficult enough to 
duplicate, but the pattern snaps 
the clincher on it. Only the government's got the equipment to 
put that in. 

All of which may serve to explain why Saxegaard yelped 
when I spread the fourteen identical bills on his desk. 

T>ESIDES being the Chief Inspector, United Galactic Federations Department of the 
Treasury, Investigation Division, 
(Currency), Saxegaard is a short 
man with a big mouth. The kind 
of fellow who always waits ninety 
seconds between cigarettes so he 
won't be accused of chain smoking. 

"Baumholtzer, where'd you get 

these?" he asked after he climbed 
down off the drapes. 

They'd come into the New 
York Clearing House from a 
branch on Deneb XI. The manager there had blown his top and 
called us the minute he spotted 



them. I told Saxegaard that, and 
he chewed at his thumb for a 
few minutes. 

"Will he spread the word 
around?" he asked finally. 

"I threw the fear of UnGalac 
into him." 

"Good. At least we won't have 
any financial panics — for a while. 
Not'until that manager gets himself out from financially under, 
anyway. You checked these 
through the lab?" he hopefully 
asked, probably hoping for a 
loophole. 

"The ink and paper's government stock, all right, and they 
match government plates. Beeper 
plates don't even hum when 
they're passed over them. In fact, 
you could spend them anywhere, 
as long as you only passed one 
bill at a time." 

"Probably wouldn't even have 
to be that careful. How do you 
know all the bills in your wallet 
right now don't have the same 
serial number?" Saxegaard 
asked. 

I shook my head. "I checked." 

Saxegaard looked at the bills 
a while longer, then sank back 
into his chair. His mouth twisted 
into a sad little smile. 

"Baumholtzer," he said, "you 
know how much work this office 
has done up to now. It's a joke, 
a sinecure. Nobody, nobody can 
logically expect to counterfeit a 
bill and get away with it. It's 



38 




 



only because, throughout the Universe, there is a certain percentage of people who will try 
anything once, and a corresponding percentage of purblind idiots 
who will accept anything with 
engraving on it as currency of 
the realm, that this department 
exists at all. I have seen cigar 
coupons and crayon sketches 
come into this office. I have seen 
grocery store premium certificates and jet bus transfers, but 
only because those same microcephalic imbeciles have neglected 
to pass the stuff over a beeper 
plate. 

"Do you think I've been happy 
in my job, Baumholtzer? I get 
paid a good salary, and nothing 
ever happens to make me sweat 
to earn it. I shouldn't have any 
worries." He sighed. "But I do, 
Baumholtzer, I do. For fifteen 
years I have sat in this office and 
waited for somebody to invent a 
matter duplicator." 

I'd thought of that, too, but 
our part-time lab technician had 
mumbled something about the 
conservation of matter and energy. He had a hard time making 
it stick, though, with those fourteen bills, identical down to a 
whisky stain in one corner, staring him in the face. 

Still, one of the first things you 
learn in this racket is not to go off 
half-cocked. Saxegaard knew that, 
too, because he said, "All right, 



Baumholtzer, off to Deneb XI 
with you, and find out if anyone 
in that neighborhood has a matter duplicator, or if he hasn't, 
what he has got that looks so 
much like it." 

He looked at his watch and lit 
another cigarette. 

1LIT a cigarette and wished I. 
hadn't. The hot fog that passes for atmosphere on Deneb XI 
washed out my lungs and made 
the smoke taste like well-decayed leaf mold. I dragged a sleeve 
across my face, removing the 
sweat from my brow and replacing it with sweat from my arm. 

Deneb XI is a jungle world, 
with climate and insects to 
match. I leaned my tired and 
dripping body against a wall and 
slapped limply at a specimen of 
insect that could have given a 
Brazilian mosquito cards and 
spades. I cursed it with damp 
enthusiasm and enjoyed my view 
of the capital city of Deneb XI. 

This jewel in the diadem of the 
UnGalac was a motley collection 
of structures that looked as if 
they had been deposited there by 
the last high tide. This capital 
city — whose name, take it or 
leave it, was Glub — was also the 
only city on Deneb XI, which 
was the one reason it had endeared itself to me. 

I have my suspicions that the 
Denebians have yet to invent the 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



39 



wheel. At any rate, practically 
the only way to get around the 
planet is on foot. Not that checking every bank and electronicsupply shop in Glub was any 
Sunday promenade. My feet kept 
reminding me of that. 

The insect got in between me 
and the wall at this point, and 
stabbed me in the back. I consigned matter duplicators, blankfaced store owners, and prissy 
bank managers to the same gooey 
hell, smashed the insect against 
the wall, and headed for a bar. 

One nice thing about Deneb — 
the natives are too primitive to 
run things, so practically all the 
people who do anything important in Glub are Terrestrials, or 
at least members of the Terrestrial Federation, in whose territory 
Dencb XI lies. I not only found 
a bartender who spoke UnGalac, 
but one who knew what a Tom 
Collins was. It was a bright spot 
in an otherwise abysmal day. 

I carried my gloss over to a 
tabh and stretched out on the 
chair beside it. I would have been 
a more or less contented man if 
it hadn't been for the knowledge 
that I'd have to be up and back 
to my fruitless clod-hopping in 
a few minutes. I had yet to discover anyone who was buying 
more than a normal amount of 
electronic parts, or who had 
bought same at any time in the 
recent past. 



The banks were no better. Nobody had pushed large amounts 
of money across their plates recently, nobody had brought in 
any duplicate bills for investigation, nobody had deposited bills 
with identical serial numbers. If 
I asked a clerk how come fourteen duplicates had gotten 
through, the answer was that it 
must have been during Harry's 
shift, or Moe's, or Maxie's. Anybody's but theirs. I'd found seven 
defective beeper plates in five 
banks, but taking the wind out 
of the sails of caspetitious bank 
managers wasn't helping me find 
my man. 

I took one last drag on the 
Tom Collins and was about to 
leave when I looked up and saw 
an interesting individual standing 
over my table. 

TTE was a Terrestrial, but he'd 
been on Deneb a long time, 
because he was wearing the floursack type of garment the natives 
have. His hair, which was potatofield gray, was parted in the middle and curled around his 
temples and led back behind his 
ears. The ears had little pieces 
of bone in them. His eyes were 
corniced with the biggest damned 
eyebrows I ever saw, and his 
ping-pong-ball nose was thrust 
out of a clump of whiskers. He 
stood about six eight and must 
have weighed close to one hun


40 




 



dred pounds, saturated. 

I lay back and enjoyed the 
sight for a while. He stared right 
back, but I guess he got tired of 
playing look-me-in-the-eye, because the whiskers moved and 
the apparition spoke. 

"Mr. Baumholtzer?" it queried 
in a disappointingly normal 
voice. 

"True," I confessed. 

"The same Mr. Baumholtzer 
who has been going around asking all those questions about duplicate UnGalac notes?" 

"Probably. What's your trouble, Mr—?" I let it trail off in 
the time-honored fashion. 

"Munger," he answered. "Duodecimus Munger." 

"This bids fair to become fascinating," F said, wondering 
whether it would be Moe or Maxie that was going to get the blame 
for letting my name and assignment leak out. "Won't you pull 
up a chair, Mr. Munger?" 

"I'm afraid I won't have time," 
he answered in a flustered voice. 
"Are you really the Mr. Baumholtzer that's working on this 
case for the Treasury Department?" 

"Yeah, sure," I answered. 
"Why ? You're not the fellow 
that's turning out these duplicates, are you?" Which stands as 
the leading question of the year, 
because Munger rummaged 
around in the folds of his toga 



and came up with a Mistral coagulator, which he then pointed 
at my head. 

"I am," he said. 

The bartender hit the floor 
with a crash and I put my hands 
on the edge of the table. "Let's 
not make any rash decisions, 
now," I said, wondering if I 
could get to my own pacifier before he fused my brains solid. 

Munger shook his head. "I 
can't very well see how I could 
let you live." 

"Aw, come on, try," I answered, and tilted the table into the 
pit of his stomach at the same 
time I dived for the floor. 

The Mistral belched and mummified a potted plant behind me. 
The table smashed against the 
floor. 

Munger said "Oh, drat!" and 
landed with a sound like a pool 
cue bouncing on linoleum. I 
scrambled over the table and 
managed to raise an arm and 
swipe at his jaw. I missed, but I 
hit the Mistral, which flew across 
the room and broke open, immolating every bug in that vicinity, but rendering itself obsolete 
at the same moment. 

Munger made an annoyed 
sound and clubbed me on the 
jaw. I started to pass out, and he 
put his hands around my neck, 
but right about then the bartender let out a yelp that must have 
attracted some attention, because 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



feet came running toward the bar 
from out in the street. 

Munger repeated his expression 
of annoyance and smacked me 
another one. This time I went 
under. 

SOMETHING wet was dabbing 
my face I opened my eyes, 
and there was the bartender with 
a wet rag. 

"All right, where is he?" I 
asked. 

The bartender gave me a 
frightened look. "He's gone. He 
ran out when I yelled. I came 
right over and started to bring 
you to. You haven't been unconscious for more than a minute. 
That's because I came right over 
and started to bring you to. He 
ran out when I yelled, you know." 

"Which way did he go, Galahad?" 

"I — I don't know. I didn't have 
time to notice after I yelled and 
came over to — " 

"Stuff it!" I said, threw him 
off, and ran out the back door. 

Naturally, there wasn't a trace 
of Munger. I tried the front, but 
there was a small crowd out there, 
and he hadn't gone that way. 

I walked back to the bar, "All 
right, bright eyes," I said, "feed 
me another Collins. And don't 
put any little sprigs of mint in 
it." 

"Well, you don't have to get 
huffy about it!" he said. 



REALLY, Mr. Baumholtzer, 
there's no need to be excited 
about this unfortunate occurrence," the police inspector said. 
He leaned back in his chair and 
gazed at the end of his cigar. 
"This man was an obvious maniac. We'll pick him up on your 
complaint in a day or two, and 
he'll eventually wind up in a psycho ward." 

I sighed. I was getting worse 
than nowhere. I reached into my 
pocket and pulled out my buzzer. I flung it on his desk. 

"This badge says I'm a Treasury Agent, so don't go treating 
me like an ordinary taxpayer. 
I'm here investigating a counterfeiting case and this guy's in it 
up to his conspicuous ears. Now 
let's see some action!" 

I wasn't supposed to let anyone in on my job, but the news 
was already all over town, so the 
cops might as well be enlightened, 
too. 

The inspector's eyebrows went 
up. "Counterfeiting?" I could 
hear the wheels running around 
loose inside his head. "Alaric!" 
he yelled all of a sudden. "Alaric! Get me the Munger file!" He 
turned back to me with a pieeating grin on his face. "I'm sorry, Mr. Baumholtzer, I'm afraid 
I was telling you something of a 
white lie. 

"You see," he went on. "we get 
a number of complaints about 



42 




 



Munger, but he's apparently a 
very wealthy man. He's a trader 
or something at a native village 
in the interior, and once or twice 
a year he comes out and raises a 
little hell. He scares people sometimes and I thought this was one 
of those cases. But counterfeiting? Well!" 
"Yeah," I said. 

I had a hunch the inspector 
was kind of worried that some of 
Munger's money might have 
found its way to him. I wouldn't 
have any real trouble with the 
inspector, though. He could be 
bought, but he wouldn't stay 
bought. Not if any big trouble 
came up, anyway. % 

"You say he was a trader?" I 
asked, trying to pass time until 
the file came up. "How docs this 
tie in with a matter duplicator?" 

"Matter duplicator!" The inspector turned pale. "You mean 
those counterfeits of his are identical copies of the real thing?" 

"That's the idea." 

"You don't say!" 

He was fighting hard not to 
dig into his wallet and take a 
thorough, nervous look. 

FILL your bathtub full of mud. 
Build a fire under it, turn on 
the hot shower, and crawl in. 
Wallow. Do that and you've got 
a fair idea of the Denebian jungle. 

Never mind the trees. The in


spector and I had been plowing 
along for half a day and I hadn't 
seen a tree yet — the rain was too 
thick. I ran into them and I still 
couldn't see them, maybe because 
there was mud all over me every 
time I picked myself up. I'd 
stumble on until the rain washed 
me off. and then I'd hit another 
tree, and ploppo! 

The inspector led the way. 
stopping to consult a compass 
and a map once in a while. He 
was all eagerness. 

Finally, he put out a hand and 
stopped me. I looked up and realized there was no rain corning 
down on me at about the same 
time I saw the leaf-thatched roof. 

"Rain shelter." he explained. 
"The natives build them. This 
one's not too far from Munger's 
village. We'll rest a while and — " 
The inspector's mouth hung open. 

I turned around and there, in 
the hw corner of the shelter, stood 
Munger and a couple of -natives 
armed with spears. 

"Coincidence, what?" Munger 
asked, grinning nastily. He turned to the natives and said something that I swear sounded like 
"Itchy scratchy." but it must 
have meant "Take care of 'em 
for me. boys," or something likethat, because they moved in on 
us. 

One of the lads had the point 
of his spear right in my middle 
or I would have tried to break 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



43 



for it, but the inspector was luckier. 

"I'll get help!" he yelled, and 
took off into the mud like a bigbottomed turtle. 

The native that was supposed 
to handle him took off after him, 
but the inspector had the advantage of feet developed through 
years of pounding beats. The native realized almost immediately 
that he was up against superior 
talent, tried a perfunctory cast of 
his spear, and then came sloshing 
back to our little tableau. 

"Well, Mr. Baumholtzer, your 
companion's action has saved 
your life, for a while," Munger 
-said. "Now we'll have to hold 
you as a hostage in case help 
should arrive." 

"Thanks," I said. 

I was looking at my native's 
loincloth. It was composed of 
tastefully arranged thousandcredit notes. 

" Itchy scratchy pretty damn 
quickie," Munger said, and this 
time it obviously meant "Let's 
get this jerk to the village, fellows," because that's what they 
did. 

npHE jungle echoed to the thunder of a huge drum. In the 
flickering firelight, naked figures 
swayed and leaped, and bare feet 
thudded on a log platform in the 
center of the village. The rhythm 
vibrated through the platform 



until the air seemed to shudder, 
and the tremors shook my trussed-up body. 

"flrr-room ! Boom!" 
- A strident keening rose from 
the savage throats and distant 
huts sent back the echo of the 
primal wail. The firelight gleamed from the polished skin of Duodecimus Munger, who had 
doffed the formal toga and assumed the simple loincloth of the 
jungle. He stood impassively beside me, his arms folded, staring 
out with brooding eyes over the 
people he ruled. In the fire's 
gleam, he was as much a savage 
as they, and the majesty of his 
bearing spoke more loudly than 
words that he was their king. 

He inclined his head toward 
me and spoke. 

"It's amazing, the nonsense 
you have to take with these people." he said. "This clambake, for 
instance. They're propitiating the 
spirit of the tree. Why? I don't 
know. Damn tree's never failed 
yet." He indicated a majestic 
giant of the jungle with a nod. 
"But no. they've got to go into 
this marathon every night before 
I do my stuff. This'll keep up to 
dawn and I'll be dead on my feet 
tomorrow, but we got to have the 
stinkin' dance." He shook his 
head in disgust. "Jesus. I wish 
I had a fifth handy. I've been 
drinking this native bilge for too 
long." 



44 




 



Then he went back into his 
cigar store Indian act. 

He was right. We were up until 
the sun rose and that racket 
didn't knock off for an instant. I 
had all that time to sit there, trying to figure out where Munger 
was making those duplicate bills, 
and what was so important about 
that tree. Needless to say, I didn't 
reach any illuminating conclusions. That drum kept pounding 
away like crazy. If I could have 
gotten loose somehow, I would 
have grabbed my gun, which 
Munger now had strapped to his 
waist, and shot that berserk 
drummer before even thinking 
about making a break for it. 

Finally the sun came up and 
the Denebians quit howling. 
Neither Munger nor I were in a 
mood for small talk or pleasant 
conversation by that time. He 
picked me up and put me on my 
feet. 

"Let's go, Baumholtzer," he 
said. "Now you'll discover just 
how it's done." 

"Good of you to show me,*' I 
said. "I suppose this means I'll 
never live to tell about it." 

"That's very sensible of you. I 
like a man who can face facts." 

walked across the log 
** platform to the base of the 
tremendous tree in whose honor 
the recent brawl had been held. I 
still couldn't see the connection. 



but I was willing to wait. 

I didn't have to. Not very long, 
anyway. Munger reached into a 
pouch on his loincloth and pulled 
out a bill. I looked at it. It was 
either another of the duplicates 
I'd brought into Saxegaard's office, or else it was the parent bill. 

"I don't use the thousand-credit note unless the natives need 
new loincloths," Munger explained over his shoulder. "These fifties are a lot easier to dispose of." 

"The hell they are," I said. 
"How'd I find you?" 

"That was a mistake." he answered testily. "The minute I've 
got enough of these made, I sell 
them to certain — ah — contacts 
of mine for fifty per cent of face 
value. What you caught was a 
sample batch one of my former 
contacts spent through misguided 
avarice." 

"Less talk and more action," 
I said. I didn't even have to guess 
what had happened to his "contact" and I was impatient to see 
how he was going to get a tree 
to duplicate his money for him. 

"All right," he said, pulling my 
gun out of his belt. "I used to 
have the natives make a loud 
noise, but this will be infinitely 
more efficient." 

He'd folded the fifty-credit 
bill into a paper airplane while 
we'd been talking. Now he held 
it in his right hand, ready to 
launch at the tree, while he 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



45 



raised my gun in his left. Behind 
us, the murmurs among the natives cut down into silence. The 
tree's big leaves rustled loudly in 
the silence. 

Bam! The gun went off and the 
folded bill flew at the tree. It 
sailed into the foliage. 

There was a popping noise. 



Followed by another. And another. More. More, infinitely more, 
and still more, until all I could 
hear was pop! pop! pop! 

The bill came sailing back out 
of the foliage. Right behind it 
came another one, and behind 
these came flight groups, squadrons, wings, armadas of paper 



16 




 



airplanes that were fifty-credit 
noces! They scattered out in all 
directions from the strangely 
moving foliage, and sailed around 
over tne native village. 

"Well, what do you know?" I 
said blankly, my mouth open. An 
airplane flew into it. I pulled the 
plane out and carefully umolded 
it, staring at it with bulging eyes. 
It was as genuine as the day is 
long. All around me the natives 
were going crazy, running and 
jumping around, picking airplanes out of the air and off the 
ground, stuffing them into little 
bags they had ready. 

Munger turned around and 
looked at me. "Startling, isn't 
it?" he asked politely. 

"Protective mimicry!" I yelled, suddenly realizing. 

He nodded. "Precisely. I discovered this tree six years ago. I 
was lost while attempting to 
evade the clutches of the law on 
a confidence rap. I swung an ax 
at the damn thing to blaze a trail, 
and I almost got scalped. Fifty 
axes came bouncing back at me." 

"But how did anything ever 
develop mimicry to this extent? 
I've heard of animals and insects 
assuming the forms of dangerous 
life-forms as camouflage, but 
never to this degree." 

"Search me," Munger said. 
"The Eglins contacted this world 
centuries ago, before the Terrestrials took this federation away 



from them. They were great little 
experimenters, the Eglins." 

"Hram. It does look funny, just 
this one tree like this. Maybe it 
was some kind of experimental 
plant. It is just one tree, isn't it?" 
I asked hastily. 

"Definitely. After I became 
buddies with the natives and set 
up this village here, I had them 
scour the jungle for another like 
it, but no go." 

"Hell, one's good enoufh. What 
a setup! You scare the tree with 
a loud noise, and it obliges by 
duplicating what it thinks is the 
menace. Brother!" 

"That's what I said when those axes came at me," Munger said. 
He was facing me, with fifty credit bills settling down all 
around him, and now he raised 

my gun. "Well, Baumholtzer, it 
looks as though your pal didn't 
bring help, after all. I'll miss your 
company." 

He began tightening on the 
trigger, and I started to sweat. 

Suddenly there was an outbreak of yelling on the other side 
of the village. A gun went off and 
several spears slashed through 
the air. 

"The cops!" Munger stood 
staring at the inspector and his 
men as they broke into the open 
from the edge of the jungle. 
"They must have sneaked up 
after surprising my lookouts!" 

Munger raised my gun again. 
"I'll still get you, though!" 

I charged at him, hoping he'd 



miss the first shot. 

He didn't fire it before I plowed into him. We rolled onto the 
ground and I grabbed for him, 
but he scrambled away. I stumbled back against the tree just 
as he fired and missed me. 

WELL, that's about if. Here 
we sit in the spaceport on 
Deneb XI, waiting for the government to get around to sending out a ship to pick us all up. 

Once Munger missed his shot, 
the fight was over, for obvious 
reasons. He didn't stand a chance 
against us. 

Yeah, us. All one hundred and 
sixty-eight of me.
