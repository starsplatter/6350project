RING AROUND THE SUN By CLIFFORD D. SIMAK 


SO Vickers was supposed to 
stop Crawford. But first he 
had to figure out the angles. 

There was the might of industry, not one industry alone, but 
the might of all the industry in 
the entire world. There was the 
fact that Crawford and industry 
had declared open war upon the 
mutants. And there was the matter of the secret weapon. 

"Desperation and a secret weapon," Crawford had said, sitting 
in the hotel room. "But the secret weapon," he had added, 
"isn't good enough." 

First of all, Vickers had to 
know what the secret weapon 
was. Until he knew that, there 
would be no point in making any 
plans. 

He lay in bed and stared at 
the ceiling and sorted out the 
facts and had a look at them. 
Then he juggled them a bit, balancing the strength of normal 
human against the strength of

mutant. There were many places 
where they canceled one another 
and there were other instances 
where they did not. 

He got exactly nowhere. 

"And of course I won't,*' he 
said. "This is the old awkward 
normal human way of doing. This 
is reasoning." 

Hunch was the thing. 

And how to do the hunching? 

He swept the factors from his 
mind and lay upon the bed, staring at the darkness where the 
ceiling was, and did not try to 
think, ' 

He could feel the factors 
bumping in his brain, bouncing 
together, then fleeing from each 
other, but he ignored and shunned them. 

An idea came: War. 

He thought about it and it grew 
and gripped him. 

War, but a different kind of 
war than the world had ever 
known. What was that phrase 
from the old history of the beginning of World War II? A 
phony war. And yet not a phony 
war. 

It was a disturbing thing to 
think about something you 
couldn't place — to have a hunch 
— that was it, a hunch gnawing 
at you and not knowing what it 
was. 

He tried to think about it and 
it retreated from him and he 
stopped thinking. 



Another idea came: Poverty. 

And poverty was somehow tied 
up with war and he sensed the 
two ideas, circling like coyotes 
around the campfire that was 
himself, snarling and growling at 
one another in the darkness beyond the flame of his understanding. 

He tried to banish them into 
the darkness and they would not 
banish. 

A FTER a time, he grew accustomed to them and it seemed 
that the campfire flickered lower 
and the coyote-ideas did not run 
so fast nor snap so viciously. 

There was another factor, said 
his sleepy mind. The mutants 
were short on manpower. That's 
why they had the robots and the 
androids. 

There would be ways you could 
get around a manpower shortage. 
You could take one life and split 
it into many lives. You could 
take one mutant life and you 
could spread it thin, stretch it 
out and make it last longer and 
go further. In the economy of 
manpower, you could do many 
things if you just knew how. 

The coyotes were circling more 
slowly now and the fire was growing dimmer and I'll stop you, 
Crawford, I'll get the answer and 
I'll stop you cold and I love you, 
Ann, and — 

Then, not knowing he had

slept, he woke and sat upright 
in the bed. 
He knew! 

OHIVERING in the chill of 
summer dawn, he swung his 
legs from beneath the covers and 
felt the cold of the floor against 
his bare soles. 

Vickers ran to the door and 
yanked it open and came out into 
the landing. The stairway spiraled down into the hall below 
him. 

"Flanders !" he shouted. "Where 
are you, Flanders?". 

Hezekiah appeared from somewhere and began to climb the 
stairs, calling, "What is the matter, sir? Is there something you 
want?" 

"I want Horton Flanders!" 

Another door opened and 
Flanders stood there, bony ankles 
showing beneath his pajama bottom, sparse hair standing almost 
erect. 

"What's going on?" he asked, 
tongue still thick with sleep. 
"What's all this racket about?" 

Vickers strode across the hall 
and grabbed him by the shoulders 
and demanded, "How many of 
us are there, Flanders? How 
many ways was Jay Vickers' life 
divided?" 

"If you'll stop shaking me — " 

"I will when you tell me the 
truth!" 

"Oh, gladly," Flanders said. 



"There are three of us — you and 
I and . . 

"You?" 

"Certainly? Why not?" 

"But you're older than I." 

"You can do a great deal with 
synthetic flesh," said Flanders. 
"You should know that. I don't 
see why you're surprised." 

And he wasn't, Vickers suddenly realized. It was as if he had 
been aware of it all his life. 

"The third one?" he asked. 
"You said there are three of us." 

Flanders shook his head. "I'm 
afraid I can't tell you that yet." 

"Why not?" 

"It would — create complications for you. Impair your efficiency and thus your value." 

"By knowing who the other 
third of Jay Vickers is?" 

"Decidedly. Not only can I not 
tell you who it is, but I can't 
even explain why I can't, because 
it would give away what I must 
conceal from you." 

A frightful suspicion came into 
Vickers' mind. He stepped away 
from Flanders and his back 
touched the doorway to his own 
room and he leaned against it, 
shaking. 

"I know," he said. "I know who 
the other is." 

Flanders shrugged. "Perhaps. 
You won't get confirmation or 
denial from me." 

Vickers turned and faced him. 
"I have it now, everything you 



116 




 



hoped for. I know the secret weapon and the answer to it. You 
said I should stop Crawford. I 
can." 

"You're sure of that?" 

"Completely sure," said Vickers, "but what the hell's the use?" 

He went into his room and 
shut the door. 

XXXVIII 

rr*HERE had been a moment 
when he had seen his course 
straight and clear before him — 
the realization that Kathleen 
Preston might have been no more 
than a conditioned figment, that 
for years the implanted memory 
of the walk in the enchanted valley had blinded him to his love 
for Ann Carter and the love he 
now was sure she felt for him, 
disguised behind their silly bitter 
quarreling. 

Then had come the knowledge 
that his parents slept away the 
years in suspended animation, 
waiting for the coming of that 
world of peace to which they had 
given so much — waiting, too, 
for the immortality which alone 
could revitalize their aged bodies. 

And he had not been able to 
turn his back upon them. 

Perhaps, he told himself, it 
was just as well, for now there 
was this other factor — making 
more than one life out of a single 
individual. 



It was a sensible way to do 
things, possibly a valid method, 
for the mutants needed manpower. When you needed manpower, 
you did the best you could with 
what you had at hand. You 
placed in the hands of robots the 
work that could be left to robots, 
and you took men and women 
and out of each of those lives you 
made several, housing the living 
fractions in the bodies of your 
androids. 

Ann Carter was not another 
person, at all, but a part of him. 
For three androids had been 
given the spark of life from the 
person who had been Jay Vickers — he and Horton Flanders and 
Ann Carter. In time, the three of 
them would let their life flow 
back again into the body of the 
original Jay Vickers. And when 
that happened, he wondered, 
which one of them would continue as Jay Vickers? Or would 
none of them? Would it be a 
sentence of death for all three of 
them and a continuation of the 
consciousness that Jay Vickers 
himself had known? Or would 
the three of them be mingled, so 
that the resurrected Jay Vickers 
would be a Flanders-CarterVickers personality? 

TTE shook his head. There was 
no way of knowing. 
If it were the three of them, a 
commingling of the three of them, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



117 



God help the original Jay Vickers when he was resurrected. 

And the love he bore Ann Carter, the tenderness after the 
moonlight-and-roses years — what 
of that love now? 

There could be no such love, 
he knew. You could not love a 
facet of yourself or let a facet of 
yourself love you. 

Twice he had known love of a 
woman and twice it had been 
taken from him and now he was 
trapped with no other choice but 
to do the job that had been assigned him. 

He had told Crawford that 
when he knew what was going on, 
he'd come back and talk to him 
and between the two of them 
they'd see if there was a compromise. 

But there was no compromise 
now. 

Not if his hunch was right. 

And Flanders had said that 
hunch was a mutant way of reasoning, a more mature, more 
positive way of arriving at the 
answer to a problem. A method, 
Flanders had told him, that did 
away with the winding path of 
reason that the human race has 
used through all its formative 
years. 

For the secret weapon was the 
old, old weapon of deliberate 
war, waged with mathematical 
cynicism and calculated precision. 



How many wars, he wondered, 
could the human race survive? 
And the answer seemed to be: 
Just one more real war. 

The mutants were the survival 
factor in the race of Man and 
now there was nothing left to 
him — neither Kathleen nor Ann, 
nor even, perhaps, the hope of 
personal humanity. He must 
work as best he could to carry 
forward the lone hope of the 
human race. 

Someone tapped softly and politely at the door. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "Come on 
in." 

"Breakfast will be ready, sir," 
said Hezekiah, "by the time you 
get dressed." 

XXXIX 

INLANDERS was waiting for 
him in the dining room when 
Vickers came down the stairs. 

"The others left," said Flanders. "They had work to do. And 
you and I have plotting." 

Vickers did not answer. He 
pulled out a chair and sat down 
across from Flanders. The sunlight from the windows came 
down across Flanders' shoulders 
and his head stood out against 
the window glass in bold relief, 
with the whiteness of his hair like 
a fuzzy halo. His clothes still 
were slightly shabby and his 
necktie had seen better days, but 



118 




 



he still was neat and his face 
shone with the scrubbing he had 
given it. 

"I see that Hezekiah found 
some clothes for you," said Flanders. "I don't know what we'd 
do without Hezekiah." 

"A pack of money, too. It was 
lying on the dresser with the shirt 
and tie. I didn't take the time to 
count it, but there seem to be 
several thousand dollars." 

"Hezekiah thinks of everything." 

"But I don't want several 
thousand dollars." 

"Go ahead," said Flanders. 
"We've got bales of it." 

"Bales!" 

"Certainly. We keep making 
it." 

"You mean you counterfeit it?" 

"Oh, bless me, no," said Flanders, "although it's something we 
have often thought of. Another 
string to our bow, you might 
say." 

"You mean flood the normal 
world with counterfeit money?" 

"It wouldn't be counterfeit. We 
could duplicate the money exactly. Turn loose a hundred billion dollars of new money in the 
world and there'd be hell to pay." 

"I can see the point," said Vickers. "I'm amazed you didn't do 
it." 

Flanders looked sharply at 
him. "I have a feeling that you 
disapprove of us." 



"In some ways I do." 

TJEZEKIAH brought in a tray 
with tall glasses of cold 
orange juice, plates of scrambled 
eggs and bacon, buttered toast, 
a jar of jam and a pot of coffee. 

"Have you noticed," asked th*j 
robot, "how fine the morning is?"} 

"I have noticed that," said! 
Vickers. 

"The weather here is most un-j 
usually fine. Much finer, I am; 
told, than on the earth ahead." 

He served the food and left, 
out through the swinging door 
into the kitchen, where they could 
hear him moving about at his 
morning chores. 

"We have been humane," said ] 
Flanders, "as humane as possi- I 
ble. But we had a job to do and I 
once in a while someone got his j 
toes stepped on. It may be that j 
we will have to get a little rough- 1 
er now, because we are being ! 
pushed. If Crawford and his gang 
had just taken it a little easier, 
it would have worked out all 
right and we wouldn't have had 
to hurt them or anyone else. Now 
it has to amount almost to revolution. Had we been given twenty 
years more, it would have been 
evolution. Given time, we would 
have taken over not only world 
industry and world finance, but 
world government as well, only 
they didn't give us the time. The 
crisis came too soon." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



119 



"What we need now," said 
Vickers, "is a counter-crisis." 

"We set up dummy companies. 
We should have set up more, but 
we lacked the manpower. Given 
the manpower, we would have 
gone more extensively into the 
manufacture of certain basic 
gadgets. But we needed the little 
manpower we had at so many 
other places — at key points or 
to search for other mutants to 
enlist into our group." 

"There must be many mutants," Vickers said. 

"There are a number of them," 
agreed Flanders, "but a large 
percentage of them are so entangled in the world and the affairs of the normal world that 
you can't dislodge them. Take a 
mutant man married to a normal 
woman. You simply can't break 
up a happy marriage. Say some 
of their children are mutants — 
what can you do about them? 
Not a thing. You simply watch 
and wait. When they grow up 
and go out on their own, you 
can approach them, but not until 
then. 

"Take a banker or an industrialist upon whose shoulders 
rests an economic empire. Tell 
him he's a mutant and he'll laugh 
at you. He's made his place in 
life. He's satisfied. His loyalties 
are set to the pattern of the life 
he's made and there's nothing we 
can offer that will interest him." 



"You might try immortality," 
suggested Vickers. 

"We haven't got immortality." 

"You should have attacked on 
the governmental level." 

FLANDERS shook his head. 
"We did a little of it, but not 
much. With a thousand major 
posts in governments of the 
world, we would have won easily 
and quickly. But we didn't have 
the thousand mutant diplomats 
to train. By various methods, we 
headed off crisis after crisis. The 
carbohydrates relieved a situation which would have led to war. 
Helping the West get the hydrogen bomb years ahead of time 
held off the East just when they 
were set to strike. But we weren't 
strong enough and we didn't have 
the time to carry out any welldefined long-range program, so 
we had to improvise. We introduced gadgets as the only quick 
way we knew to weaken the socio-economic system of Earth 
and, of course, that meant that 
sooner or later we would force 
Earth industry to band against 
us." 

"What else would you expect?" 
asked Vickers. "You interfere . . ." 

"I suppose we do," said Flanders. "The human race is our 
patient. It has a malignant 
growth. We are surgeons. It will 
be painful for the patient and 
there will be a period of conval


120 




 



escence, but at least the patient 
will live and I have the gravest 
doubts that the human race could 
survive another war." 

"But the high-handed methods 
you use!" 

"Now wait a moment," Flanders objected. "You think there 
must be other methods and I will 
agree, but all of them would be 
equally objectionable to humanity and the old human methods 
themselves have been discredited 
long ago. Men have shouted 
peace and there has been no 
peace. You would have us hold 
conferences? I ask you, my 
friend, what is the history of the 
conference? 

"Or maybe we should go before the people, before the heads 
of government, and say to them 
we are the new mutations of the 
race and that our knowledge and 
our ability are greater than theirs 
and that they should turn all 
things over to us so we could 
bring the world to peace. What 
would happen then? I can tell 
you what would happen. They'd 
hate us and drive us out. So there 
is no choice for us. We must work 
underground. We must attack 
the key points. No other way will 
work." 

"TJP7HAT you say," said Vick" ers, "may be true so far as 
the people are concerned, but 
how about the individual? How 



about the little fellow who gets 
socked in the teeth?" > 

"Asa Andrews was here this 
morning," Flanders told him.^'He 
said you'd been at his place and 
had disappeared and he was worried about what might have happened to you. But that is beside 
the point. What I want to ask you 
is, would you say that Asa Andrews was a happy man?" 

"I've never seen anybody happier." 

"And yet," said Flanders, "we 
interfered with him. We took 
away his job — the job he needed 
to feed his family and clothe 
them and keep a roof above their 
heads. He searched for jobs and 
could find none. When he finally 
came for help, we knew that we 
were the ones who cost him his 
job that forced him finally to be 
evicted, to stand in the street and 
not know where his family would 
lay their heads that night. We did 
all this and yet, in the end, he is 
a happy man. There are thousands of others throughout this 
earth who have thus been interfered with and now are happy 
people. Happy, I must insist, 
because of our interference." 

"You can't claim," Vickers 
contended, "that there is no price 
for this happiness. I don't mean 
the loss of job, the bread of charity—but what comes afterward. 
You are settling them here on this 
earth in what you are pleased 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



to call a pastoral-feudal stage, 
but the fancy name you call it 
can't take away the fact that, in 
being settled here, they have lost 
many of the advantages of advanced civilization." 

"We have taken from them," 
Flanders said, "little more than 
the knife with which to cut their 
own or their neighbor's throat. 
Whatever else we've taken from 
them will in time be given back, 
in full measure and with fantastic 
interest. For it is our hope, Mr. 
Vickers, that in time to come they 
all will be like us, that eventually the entire race may have 
everything we have. 

"We are not freaks, you understand-, but human beings, the 
next step in evolution. We're just 
a step ahead of all the rest. To 
survive, Man had to change, had 
to mutate, had to become something more than what he was. We 
are only the first forerunners of 
that mutation of survival. And 
because we are the first, we must 
fight a delaying action. We must 
fight for the time that it will take 
for the rest of them to catch up 
with us. In us you see not one 
little group of privileged persons, 
but all of humanity." 

"Humanity," said Vickers 
sourly, "seems to be taking a dim 
view of your delaying fight to 
save them. Up on that world of 
ours, they're smashing gadget 
shops and hunting down the mu


tants and hanging them from 
lamp posts." 

"That's where you come in," 
Flanders pointed out. 

^TICKERS nodded. "You want 
* me to stop Crawford." 

"You told me you could." 

"I had a hunch." 

"Your hunches, my friend, are 
more likely to be right than the 
most precise reasoning." 

"I will need some help," said 
Vickers. 

"Anything you say." 

"I want some of your pioneers 
— men like Asa Andrews — sent 
back to do some missionary 
work." 

"But we can't do that," protested Flanders. 

"They're in this fight, too," 
said Vickers. "They can't expect 
to sit back and not lift a finger." 

"Missionary work? You want 
them to go back to tell about 
these other worlds?" 

"That is exactly what I want." 

"But no one would believe 
them. With the feeling running as 
it is on Earth, they would be 
mobbed and lynched." 

Vickers shook his head. "There 
is one group that would believe 
them — the Pretentionists. Don't 
you see, the Pretentionists are 
fleeing from reality. They pretend 
to go back and live iff the London 
of Pepys' day, and to many other 
eras of the past, but even there 



122 




 



they find certain restraining influences, certain encroachments 
upon their own free will and their 
security. But here there is complete freedom and security. Here 
they could go back to the simplicity, the uncomplicated living 
that they are yearning for. No 
matter how fantastic it might 
sound, the Pretentionists would 
embrace it." 

"You're certain of this?" asked 
Flanders. 

"Positive," said Vickers. 

"But that's not all?" 

"There is one thing more." said 
Vickers. "If there were a sudden 
demand on the carbohydrates, 
could you meet it?" 

"I think we could. We could 
reconvert our factories. The gadget business is shot now. To dispense carbohydrates, we'd have 
to set up a sort of black market 
system. If we went out in the 
open, Crawford and his crew 
would break it up." 

"At first, perhaps," agreed 
Vickers. "But not for very long. 
Not when tens of thousands of 
people would be ready to fight 
him to get their carbohydrates." 

"When the carbohydrates are 
needed," Flanders said, "they'll 
be there." 

"rpHE Pretentionists will believe," said Vickers. "They 
are ripe for belief, any kind of 
fantastic belief. To them it will 



be an ' imaginative crusade. 
Against a normal population, we 
might have no chance, but we 
have a great segment who have 
been driven to escape by the sickness of the world. All they need is 
a spark, a word — some sort of 
promise that there is a chance of 
real escape instead of the illusory 
escape they have been driven to. 
There will be many who will want 
to come to this second world. 
How fast can you bring them 
through?" 

"As fast as they come." 

"I can count on that?" 

"You can count on that." Flanders lifted his shoulders. "I don't 
know what you're planning. I 
hope your hunch is right." 

"You said it was," Vickers declared. 

"You know what you're going 
up against? You know what 
Crawford's planning?" 

"I think he's planning war. 
He said it was a secret weapon. 
I'm convinced it's war." 

"But war . . ." 

"Let's look at war," said Vickers, "just a little differently than 
it ever has been looked at, just 
a little differently than the historians see it. Let's see it as a 
business because war, in certain 
aspects, is just that. When a 
country goes to war, it means that 
labor and industry and resources 
are mobilized and controlled by 
governments. The businessman 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



123 



plays as important a part as does 
the military man. The banker 
and the industrialist are as much 
in the saddle as the general. 

"Now let's go one step further 
and imagine a war fought on 
strictly business lines — for the 
strictly business purpose of obtaining and retaining control in 
those very areas we are threatening. War would mean that the 
system of supply and demand 
would be suspended and that certain civilian items would cease to 
be manufactured and that the 
governments could crack down on 
anyone who would attempt to 
sell them . . .** 

"Like cars, perhaps," offered 
Flanders, "and lighters and even 
razor blades." 

"Exactly," Vickers told him. 
"That way they could gain the 
time, for they need time as badly 
as we do. Upon military pretext 
they'd seize complete control of 
the world economy." 

"What you're saying is that 
they plan to start war by agreement." 

"T'M convinced that's it," said 
Vickers. "They'd hold it to a 
minimum. Perhaps one bomb on 
New York in return for a bomb 
on Moscow and another on Chicago for one on Leningrad. You 
get the idea — a restricted war, a 
gentleman's agreement. Just 
enough fighting to convince ev


eryone that it was real. 

"But phony as it might be, a 
lot of people would die and 
there'd always be the danger that 
someone would get sore and instead of one bomb on Moscow it 
might be two, or the other way 
around, or an admiral might get 
just a bit too enthusiastic and a 
bit too accurate." 

"It's fantastic," Flanders said. 

"You forget that they are desperate men. They are fighting, 
every one of them. Russian and 
American, French and Pole and 
Czech, for the kind of life that 
Man has built upon the Earth. 
To them we must appear to be 
the most vicious enemy mankind's ever faced. They are 
frightened stiff." 

"And you?" asked Flanders. 

"I'd go back to old Earth, except that I lost the top. I don't 
know where I lost it, but . . ." 

"You don't need the top. That 
was just for novices. All you have 
to do is will yourself into the 
other world. Once you've done it, 
it's a cinch." 

"If I need to get in touch with 
you?" 

"Eb's your man," said Flanders. "Just get hold of him." 

"You'll send Asa and the 
others back?" 

"We will." 

Vickers rose and held out his 
hand. 

"But," said Flanders, ''you 



124 




 



don't need to leave just yet. Sit 
down and have another cup of 
coffee." 

Vickers shook his head. "I'm 
anxious to get going." 

"The robots could get you back 
to New York in no time at all," 
said Flanders. "You could return 
to old Earth from there." 

Vickers said, "I want time to 
think. I have to do some planning — hunching, you'd call it." 

"Buy a car," advised Flanders. 
"Hezekiah left you enough cash 
to get one and have some left 
over. Eb will have more, if you 
need it. It wouldn't be safe to 
travel any other way. They'll 
have traps set out for mutants. 
They'll be watching all the time." 

"I'll be careful," Vickers promised. 

- XL 

f|iHE room was dusty and festooned with spider webs and 
its emptiness made it seem much 
larger than it was. The paper was 
peeling from the walls and the 
plaster cracks ran like jagged 
chains of lightning from the ceiling molding to the baseboard at 
the floor. 

But one could see that at one 
time the peeling paper had been 
colorful, with garlands of little 
flowers and the larger figure of a 
Dresden shepherdess guarding 
woolly sheep and, beneath the 



film of dust, one knew the woodwork lay with some of the old 
wax still on it, ready to shine 
again when rescued from neglect. 

Vickers turned slowly in the 
center of the room and he saw 
that the doors were where they' 
had been and the windows, too, 
in that other room where he'd 
just risen from the chair after 
eating breakfast. But here the 
door to the kitchen stood open 
and the windows were dark with 
the shutters closed against them. 

He took a step or two and he 
saw that he left footprints in the 
dust and the footprints started at 
the center of the room. There 
were no footprints leading from 
anywhere to the center of the 
room. The tracks just started 
there. 

He stood and looked at the 
room and tried to reconstruct it, 
not as he had known it less than 
sixty seconds before, but as he 
first had seen it twenty years ago. 

Or was it fantasy — conditioned 
fantasy? Had he ever actually 
stood in this room before? Had 
there ever been a Kathleen Preston? And if there had been, had 
Jay Vickers ever loved her or had 
she ever loved Jay Vickers? 

He knew that a Vickers family, 
a poor farm family, had lived not 
more than -a mile from where he 
stood. He thought of them — the 
mother, courageous in her ragged dress and drab sweater; the 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



125 




father with the pitiful little shelf 
of books beside his bed and how 
he used to sit in faded overalls 
and too-big shirt, reading the 
books in the dim yellowness of 
the kerosene lamp; the son, a 
helter-skelter sort of kid who had 
too much imagination and once 
went to fairyland. 

Masquerade, he thought, a bitter masquerade, a listening post 
set out to spy out the talk of enemies. But it had been their job 
and they had done it well. They 
had watched their son grow into 
a youth and known by the manner 
of his growing that he was no 



throwback, but truly one of them. 

And now they waited, those 
two who had posed as lonely 
farmer folk for all the anxious 
years, fitting themselves into an 
ordinary niche wmch was never 
meant for such as they, against 
the day when they could take 
their rightful place in the society 
which they had given up to stand 
outpost duty for the big brick 
house standing proudly on its 
hill. 

He could not turn his back on 
them and now there was no need 
to turn his back on them, for 
there was nothing else. 




He walked across the dining 
room and along the hall that led 
to the closed front door and he 
left behind him a trail of footprints in the dust. 

Outside the door, he knew, was 
nothing — not Ann, nor Kathleen, 
nor any place for him — nothing 
but the cold knife-edge of duty 
to a life he had not chosen. 

XLI 

TIE had his moments of doubt 
while he drove across the 
country, savoring the goodness 
of the things he saw and heard 
and smelled — the little villages 
sleeping in the depth of summer 
with their bicycles and canted 
coaster wagons; the friendly 
bumbling of the great transport 
trucks on the highways; the way 
the girl behind the counter smiled 
at you when you stopped at a 
roadside eating place. 

There was nothing wrong, he 
told himself, nothing wrong with 
the little villages or the trucks or 
the girl who smiled at you when 
you asked for a cup of coffee. 
Man's world was pleasant and 
fruitful, a good place in which to 
live. 

The mutants and their plans 
seemed like a nightmare snatched 
from some lurid Sunday supplement and* he wondered, as he 
drove along, why he didn't simply pull off the road and let the 



car stay sitting there while he 
walked off into this good life he 
saw on every hand. Surely there 
was some place within it for a 
man like him; somewhere, here 
in the flat corn lands where the 
little villages clung to every 
crossroad, that a man could find 
peace and security. 

But he saw reluctantly it was 
not peace and security he sought 
for himself alone. Just a place 
to hide from the threat one could 
sense in the air. In wanting to 
leave his car beside the road and 
walk away, he was responding to 
the same bone-deep fear as the 
Pretentionists when they escaped 
emotionally to some other time 
and place. It was the urge to flee. 

The trouble was that even here, 
in the agricultural heart of the 
continent, one could feel secure 
only if one never read a paper or 
listened to a broadcast and did 
not talk with people. For the signposts of fear, of the eternal running from the threat of insecurity, 
could be found on every doorstep and in every home and at 
every corner. 

TTE read the papers and the 
news was bad. He listened to 
the radio and the commentators 
were talking about a new and 
deeper crisis than the world had 
ever faced. He listened to the 
people talking in the lobbies of 
the hotels where he spent the 



128 




 



nights or in the eating places 
where he stopped along the road. 
They would talk and shake their 
heads and one could See that they 
were worried. 

They said : "What I can't understand is how things could 
change so quick. Here, just a 
week or two ago, it looked like 
the East and West would band 
together against this mutant business. At last they had something 
they could fight together instead 
of fighting one another, but now 
they're back at it again and it is 
worse thatj ever." 

They said: "If you ask me, it's 
the Commies that stirred up this 
mutant business. You mark my 
word, they're at the bottom of 
it." 

They said: "It just don't seem 
possible. Here we sit tonight a 
million miles from- war with everything calm and peaceful. And 
tomorrow . . ." 

And tomorrow and tomorrow 
and tomorrow. 

They said: "If it was up to me, 
I'd get in touch with the mutants. 
They got stuff up their sleeve 
that would blow these Commies 
plumb to hell." 

They said: "We never should 
have demobilized at the end of 
World War II. We should have 
hit them then. We could've 
knocked them off in a month or 
two." 

They said: "The hell of it is 



that you never know. No one ever 
tells you anything and when they 
do, it's wrong." 

They said: "I wouldn't horse 
around with them a single damn 
minute. I'd load up some bombs 
and I'd let them have it." 

He listened to them and there 
was no talk of compromise or 
understanding. There was no 
hope in all the talk that war 
could be averted. "If not this 
time," they said, "it'll come in 
five years, or ten, so let's get it 
over with. You got to hit them 
first. In a war like this, there ain't 
any second chance. It's either 
them or us . . ." 

And it was then that he understood that even here, in the heartland of the nation, in the farms 
and little villages, in the roadside 
eating places, there was a boiling 
hate. That was the measure of 
the culture that had been built 
upon the Earth — a culture founded on a hatred and a terrible 
pride and a suspicion of everyone who did not talk the same 
language or eat the same food or 
dress the same as everyone else 
did. 

IT was a mechanical culture of 
clanking machines, a technological world that could provide 
creature comfort, but not human 
justice or security. It was a culture that had worked in metals, 
that had delved into the atom. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



129 



that had mastered chemicals and 
had built a complicated and 
dangerous gadgetry. It had concentrated upon the technological 
and had ignored the spiritual 
so that a man might punch a 
button and destroy a distant city 
without knowing, or even caring, 
about the lives and habits, the 
thoughts and hopes and beliefs 
of the people that he killed. 

Underneath the sleek technological surface, one could hear 
the warning rumble of machines. 
The gears and sprockets, the 
driving chain, the generator, 
without the brake of_human understanding, were racing on to 
disaster. 

He drove and ate and drove 
again. He ate and slept and drove. 
He watched the cornfields and 
the reddening apples in the orchards and heard the song of 
mower and smelled the scent of 
clover and he looked into the sky 
and felt the terrible fear that hung 
high there and he knew that 
Flanders had been right, that, to 
survive, Man must mutate and 
that the survival mutation must 
win before the storm of hate 
would break. 

But it was not only news of approaching war which rilled the 
columns of the daily press and 
spurred the news commentators 
into word-frothed quarter hours. 

There was still the mutant 
menace and the continuing ex


hortations to the people to keep 
a watch for mutants. There were 
riots and lynchings and gadget 
shops burned. 

And something else: 

A creeping whisper that spread 
across the land, that was talked 
over at the drugstore corners and 
at the dusty crossroads and in 
the shadowed night spots of the 
bigger cities— the whisper that 
there was another world, a brandnew world where one could start 
his life again, where one would 
escape from the thousands of 
years of accumulated mistakes. 

The press at first was wary of 
the rumor, then printed cautious 
stories with very restrained headlines and the commentators seemed at first to be just as wary, but 
finally took the plunge. In a day 
or two, the news of the other 
world and of the strange, starryeyed people who had talked to 
someone else (always someone 
else) and claimed they had come 
from there ranked with the news 
of approaching war and with 
hatred of the mutants. 

You could feel the world on 
edge, like the sudden, strident 
ringing of a telephone in the dead 
of night. 

XLII 

i^LIFFWOOD after dark had 
^^the smell and feel of home as 
Vickers drove along its streets 



130 




 



and felt the lump of loss come 
into his throat. It had been here 
that he had thought to settle 
down and spend his years in 
writing. 

His house was here and the 
furniture and the manuscript and 
the crudely carpentered shelf 
that held his books, but it was 
his home no longer, and now 
could never be again. And that 
wasn't all, he thought. The Earth, 
the original human earth — the 
earth with the capital "E" — was 
his home no more. 

He'd go and see Eb first and 
after he had seen Eb, he'd go to 
his own house and get the manuscript. 

He. could give the manuscript 
to Ann; she would keep it safely 
for him. 

On second thought, he'd have 
to find some other place, for he 
didn't want to see Ann — although 
that was not precisely the truth. 
He did want to see her, but knew 
he shouldn't, now that there lay 
between them the knowledge that 
he and she were part of a single 
life. 

He pulled the car to a stop in 
front of Eb's house and sat there 
for a moment looking at it, wondering at the neatness of the 
house and yard. Eb lived alone 
without wife or child, and it was 
not usual that a man alone would 
keep a place so tidy. 

He'd spend just a minute with 



Eb, would tell him what had happened, what was "going on, make 
arrangements to keep in touch 
with him, and learn from him 
whatever news might be worth 
knowing. 

He closed the car door and 
went across the walk, fumbling at 
the latch of the gate that opened 
to the yard. Moonlight came 
down through the trees and 
splotched the walk with light. 
He followed it to the porch, and 
now, for the first time, he noticed 
that there were no lights burning 
in the house. 

He rapped on the door, knowing from poker sessions and other 
infrequent visits that Eb had no 
doorbell. 

There was no answer. He waited and finally rapped again and 
then turned from the door and 
went down the walk. Maybe Eb 
was still down at the garage, putting in some overtime on an 
urgent repair job. or he might be 
down at the tavern, having a 
quick one with the boys. 

He'd sit out in the car and 
wait for Eb. It probably wouldn't 
be safe to go down into the village business section where he'd 
be recognized. 

A voice asked, "You looking 
for Eb?" 

"17ICKERS spun around to' ward the voice. It was the 
next door neighbor, he saw, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



131 



standing at the fence. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "I was 
looking for him." 

He was trying to remember 
who lived next to Eb. Someone 
he knew, someone who might 
recognize him? 

"I'm an old friend of his," 
Vickers added. "Just passing 
through. Thought I'd stop and 
say hello." 

The man had stepped through 
a break in the fence and was 
coming across the lawn. 

"How well did you know Eb?" 

"Not too well," said Vickers. 
"Haven't seen him in ten or fifteen years. We used to be kids 
together." 

"Eb is dead," the neighbor 
said. 

"Dead!" 

The neighbor spat. "He was 
one of those damned mutants." 

"No," protested Vickers. "No, 
he couldn't be!" 

"He was. We had another one. 
but he got away. We always had 
a suspicion Eb might have tipped him off." 

And in the bitterness and 
hatred of the neighbor's words, 
Vickers felt the sheer terror of 
the strange dog cornered by the 
local pack. 

The mob killed Eb and they 
would kill him if they knew he 
had returned to town. And in 
just a little while they'd know, 
for any minute now the neighbor 



would recognize him — now . he 
knew finally who ti the neighbor 
was, the beefy individual who 
worked at the meat counter in 
the town's one chain store. His 
name was — It didn't really matter. 

"Seems to me," the neighbor 
said, "I've seen you somewhere." 

"You must be mistaken. I've 
never been East before." 

"Your voice ..." 

Vickers struck with all the 
power he had, starting the first 
down low and bringing it up in 
a vicious arc, twisting his body 
to line it up behind the blow, to 
put the weight of his body behind it. 

He hit the man in the face and 
the impact of flesh on flesh, of 
bone on bone, made a whiplike 
sound and the man went down. 

JAY VICKERS did not wait. 
He went racing for the gate. 
He almost tore the car door from 
its hinges getting in. He thumbed 
the starter savagely and trod 
down on the gas and the car 
leaped down the street, spraying 
the bushes with gravel thrown 
by its frightened wheels. 

His arm was numb from the 
force of the blow he'd struck. 
When he held his hand down 
in front of the lighted dash panel, 
he saw that his knuckles were 
lacerated and slowly dripping 
blood. 



132 




 



He had a few minutes' start, 
for once the neighbor was on his 
feet, once he could reach a phone, 
they'd begin hunting him, screaming through the night on whining 
tires, with shotgun and rope and 
rifle. 

He had to get away. Now he 
was on his own. Eb was dead, 
shot down or strung up or kicked 
to death, and Eb had been his 
contact. 

Now there was no one but 
himself and Ann. 

And Ann, God willing, didn't 
even know that she was a mutant. 

He struck the main highway 
and swung down the valley. 

There was an old abandoned 
road some ten miles down the 
highway, he remembered. A man 
could duck a car in there and 
wait until it was safe to double 
back again, although doubling 
back probably wouldn't be too 
safe. 

Maybe it would be better to 
take to the hills and hide out 
until the hunt blew over. 

No, he told himself, there was 
nothing safe. 

And he had no time to waste. 

He had to get to Crawford, 
had to head Crawford off the 
best way that he could. And he 
had to do it alone. 

' I ^HE abandoned road was 
there, halfway up a long, 
steep hill. He wheeled the car 



into it and bumped along it for 
a hundred feet or so, then got 
out and walked back hastily to 
the road. 

Hidden behind a clump of 
trees, he watched cars go screaming past, but there was no way 
to know if any of them might be 
hunting him. 

Then a rickety old truck came 
slowly up the hill, engine howling with the climb. 

He watched it, an idea growing 
in his mind. 

When it came abreast, he saw 
that it was closed in the back 
with a high end gate. 

He went out into the traffic 
lane and raced after it, caught 
up with it and leaped. His fingers gripped the top of the end 
gate and he heaved himself clear 
of the road, scrambled up and 
clambered over the boxes stacked inside the truck. 

He huddled there, staring out 
at the road behind him. 

A hunted animal, he thought; 
hunted . by men who once had 
been his friends. 

After ten mites or so, someone stopped the truck. 

A voice asked: "You see anyone up the road? Walking, maybe?" 

' 'Hell, no," the truck driver 
said. "I ain't seen a soul." 

"We're looking for a mutant. 
Figure he must have ditched his 
car." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



133 



"I thought we had all of them 
cleaned out." 

"Not all. Maybe he took to the 
hills. If he did, we've got him — 
unless he \ disappears the way 
they always do when, they're 
warned." 

"Your truck'll be stopped 
again," another voice said. "We 
phoned ahead both ways. They 
got road blocks set up." 

"I'll keep my eyes peeled," the 
driver replied. 

"You got a gun?" 
-"No." 

"Well, keep watching, anyway." 

When the truck rolled on, 
Vickers saw the two men standing in the road. The moonlight 
glinted harshly on their rifles. 

He set to work cautiously, moving some of the boxes, making 
himself a hideout. 

He needn't have bothered. 

The truck was stopped at three 
other road blocks. At none of 
them did anyone do more than 
flash a light inside the truck. 
They seemed convinced that 
they wouldn't find a mutant as 
easily as finding him hidden 
among crates. 

Nor would they, for Vickers 
would have vanished to Earth 
No. 2 the instant they closed in. 
But he was glad he didn't have 
to. 

This was the quickest way to 
get to Ann Carter. 



TTE knew what he would find, 
but he went there just the 
same, because it was the only 
place he could think of where he 
might establish contact. But the 
huge show window was broken 
and the miniature house that had 
stood on display was smashed as 
utterly as if it had stood in a 
cyclone's path. 

The mob had done its work. 

He stood in front of the gaping window and stared at the 
wreckage of the model house and 
remembered the day that he and 
Ann had stopped there on their 
way to the bus station. The 
house, he recalled, had had a flying ducks weather vane and a 
sundial had stood in the yard and 
there had been a car standing in 
the driveway, but the car had 
disappeared completely. Dragged out into the street, probably, 
and smashed as his own car had 
been in that little Illinois town. 

He turned away from the window and walked slowly down the 
street. It had been foolish to go 
to the show room, he told himself, but there had been a slim 
chance — as he knew all his 
chances were. 

He turned a corner and there, 
in a dusty square across the 
street, a good -si zed crowd had 
gathered and was listening to 
someone who had climbed a park 
bench and was talking to them. 

Idly, Vickers walked across the 



134 




 



street, stopped opposite the 
crowd. 

The man on the park bench 
had taken off his coat and rolled 
up his sleeves and loosened his 
tie. He talked almost conversationally, yet his words carried 
clear across the park to where 
Vickers stood. . 

"When the bombs come," asked the man, "what will happen 
then? They say don't be afraid. 
They say stay on your jobs and 
don't be afraid. But what will 
they do when the bombs arrive? 
Will they help you then?" 

He paused and the crowd was 
tense, tense in a terrible silence. 
You could feel the knotted muscles that clamped the jaws tight 
shut and the hand that squeezed 
the heart until the body turned 
all cold. And you could sense, 
the fear — 

"'X1HEY will not help," the 
speaker told them, speaking 
slowly and deliberately. "They 
will not help you, for you will 
be past all help. You will be 
dead, my friends. Dead by the 
tens of thousands. Dead and 
restless atoms. My friends, why 
don't you heed? The other world 
awaits. The poor go first. The 
poor and desperate, the ones for 
which this world you stand on 
has no further use. The only 
way you can go is in utter poverty, by quitting your jobs and 



giving away all your possessions. 

"In that other world there are 
no bombs. There is a beginning 
over, a starting over again. An 
entire new world, almost exactly 
like this world, with trees and 
grass and fertile land and game 
upon the hills and fish teeming in 
the rivers. The kind of place you 
dream of. And there is peace." 

There were sirens screaming, 
getting closer. 

Vickers stepped off the sidewalk and dashed across the 
street. 

A squad car roared around a 
corner, skidding and whipping to 
get straightened out, its tires 
screaming on the pavement, its 
siren a-wail as if in agony. 

Almost at the curb, Vickers 
stumbled and went sprawling. 
Instinctively, he pulled himself 
to hands and knees and flicked a 
sidewise glance to see the squad 
car, bearing down upon him. He 
knew he could not make it, that 
before he could get his feet beneath him, the car would crush 
him. 

A hand came down out of nowhere and fastened on his arm 
and he felt himself catapulting 
off the street and across the sidewalk. 

Another squad car came around 
the corner, skidding and with 
flattened tires protesting, almost 
as if the first had returned to 
make a second entrance. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



The scattered crowd was running in terror. 

The hand tugged at his arm 
and hauled him erect and Vickers 
saw his benefactor for the first 
time, a man in a ragged sweater, 
with an old jagged knife-mark 
across his cheek. 

"Quick," said the man, the 
knife-mark writhing as he spoke, 
teeth flashing in the whiskershadowed face. 

He shoved Vickers into a 
narrow alleyway between two 
buildings and Vickers sprinted, 
shoulders hunched, between the 
walls of brick that rose on either 
side. 

He heard the man panting 
along behind him. 

"To your right," said the man. 
"A door." 

\fICKERS grasped the knob 
"and the door swung open into 
a darkened hall. 

The man stepped in beside him 
and closed the door and they 
stood together in the darkness, 
the sound of their gasping beating like an erratic heart in the 
confining darkness. 

"That was close," the man 
said. "Those cops are getting on 
the ball. You no more than start 
a meeting and . . ." 

He did not finish the sentence. 
Instead he reached out and 
touched Vickers on the arm. 

"Follow me," he said. "Be 



careful. There are stairs," 

Vickers followed, feeling his 
way down the creaky stairs, with 
the musty smell of cellar growing stronger with each step. 

At the bottom of the stairway, 
the man pushed aside a hanging 
blanket and they stepped into a 
dimly lighted room. There was 
an old, broken-down piano in one 
corner and a pile of boxes in 
another and a table in the center, 
around which four men and two 
women sat. 

One of the men said, "We 
heard the sirens." 

Scar-face nodded. "Charley 
was just going good. The crowd 
was getting ready to start shouting." 

"Who's your friend, George?" 
asked another. 

"He was running," said George. 
"Police car almost got him." 

They looked at Vickers with 
interest. 

"What's your name, friend?" 
asked George. 

Vickers told them. 

"Is he all right?" asked somebody. 

"He was there," said George. 
"He was running." 

"But is it safe . . ." 

"He's all right," George insisted, but Vickers noted that he 
said it too vehemently, too stubbornly, as if he now realized that 
he might have made a mistake in 
bringing a total stranger here. 



136 




 



"Have a drink," offered one of 
the men. He shoved a bottle 
across the table toward Vickers. 

Vickers sat down in a chair 
and took the bottle. 

One of the women, the betterlooking of the two, said to him, 
"My name is Sally." 

Vickers said, "I'm glad to know 
you, Sally." 

He looked around the table. 
None of the rest of them seemed 
ready to introduce themselves. 

He lifted the bottle and drank. 
It was cheap stuff. He choked a 
little on it. 

OALLY said, "You an activist?" 
^ "I beg your pardon?" 

"An activist or purist?" 

"He's an activist," said George. 
"He was right in there with the 
rest of them." 

Vickers could see that George 
was sweating a little, afraid he 
had made a mistake. 

"He sure as hell doesn't look 
like one," one of the men stated. 

"I'm an activist," said Vickers, 
because he could see that was 
what they wanted him to be. 

"He's like me," Sally declared. 
' He's an activist by principle, but 
a purist by preference. Isn't 
that right?" she asked Vickers. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "Yes, I 
guess that's it." 

He took another drink. 

"What's your period?" Sally 
asked. 



"My period?" repeated Vickers blankly. "Oh, yes, my period." 

And he remembered the white, 
intense face of Mrs. Leslie asking 
him what historic period he 
thought would be the most exciting. 

"Charles the Second," he said. 

"You were a little slow on that 
one," said one of the men suspiciously. 

"I fooled around some," Vickers evaded. "Dabbled, you know. 
Took me quite a while to find the 
period I liked." 

"And then you settled on 
Charles the Second," Sally said. 

"That's right." 

"Mine," Sally told him, "is 
Aztec." 

"But Aztec . . 

"It really isn't fair, is it? 
There's so little known about the 
Aztecs. But that way I can make 
it up as I go along. It's so much 
more fun that way." 

GEORGE said, "It's plain 
damn foolishness. Maybe it 
was all right to piddle around 
with diaries and pretend you were 
someone else when there was 
nothing else to do. But now there 
is something else to do." 

"George is right," nodded the 
other woman. 

"You activists are the ones 
who're wrong," Sally argued. 
"The basic thing in Pretentionism is the ability to lift yourself 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



137 



out of your present time and 
space, to project yourself into 
another era." 

"Now, listen here," said 
George. "I . . ." 

"Oh, I agree that we must 
work for this other world. It's 
the kind of opportunity we wanted all along. But that doesn't 
mean we have to give up . . ." 

"Cut it out," said one of the 
men, the big fellow at the table's 
end. "This ain't no place for gabbling." 

Sally said to Vickers, "We're 
having a meeting tonight. Would 
you like to come?" 

He hesitated. In the dim light, 
he could see that all of them were 
looking at him. 

"Sure," he said. "It would be 
a pleasure." 

He reached for the bottle and 
took another drink, then passed 
it on to George. 

"There won't be anybody stirring for a while," said George. 
"Not until the cops have a chance 
to get cooled off a bit." 

He took a drink and passed the 
bottle on. 

fT^HE meeting was just getting 
under way when Sally and 
Vickers arrived. 

"Will George be here?" asked 
Vickers. „, 

Sally laughed a little. "George 
here? George is a roughneck. A 
red-hot. A born organizer. How 



he escaped communism is more 
than I'll ever know." 
"And you?" 

"We are the propagandists," 
she said. "We go to meetings. We 
talk to people. We get them interested. We do the missionary 
work and get the converts who'll 
go out and preach. When we get 
them, we turn them over to people 
like George." 

"I see." 

The dowager sitting at the 
table rapped with the letter opener she was using as a gavel. 

"Please," she said. Her voice 
was aggrieved. "This meeting 
will come to order." 

Vickers held a chair for Sally, 
then took one for himself. The 
others in the room were quieting 
down. 

The room, Vickers saw, was 
really two — the living room and 
the dining room, with the French 
doors between them thrown open 
so that in effect they became one 
room. 

Upper middle class, he thought. 
Just swank enough not to be 
vulgar, but failing the grandeur 
of the really rich. Real paintings 
on the wall and a Provincial fireplace and furniture that was of 
some period or other, although he 
couldn't name it. 

He glanced at the faces around 
him and tried to place them. An 
executive type over there — a manufacturer's representative, he'd 



138 




 



guess. And that one who needed 
a haircut might be a painter 
or a writer, although not- a successful one. And the woman with 
the iron-gray hair and the outdoor tan was more than likely a 
member of some riding set. 

But it did not matter, he knew. 
Here it was upper middle class 
in an apartment house with its 
doorman uniformed, while across 
the city there would be another 
meeting in a tenement which had 
never known a doorman. And in 
the little villages and the smaller 
cities they would meet perhaps at 
the banker's house or at the barber's house. And in each instance 
someone would rap on the table 
and say would the meeting come 
to order, please. At most of the 
meetings, too, there would be a 
woman or a man like Sally, waiting to talk to the members, hoping to make converts. 

T^HE dowager was saying, 
"Miss Stanhope is the first 
member on our list to read tonight." 

Then she sat back, contented, 
now that she had them finally 
quieted down and the meeting 
started. • 

Miss Stanhope stood up and 
she was, Vickers saw, the personification of frustrated female 
flesh and spirit. She was forty, 
he would guess, and manless, and 
she would hold down a job that 



in another fifteen years would 
leave her financially independent 
— and yet she was running from 
a specter, seeking sanctuary behind the cloak of another personality from the past. 

Her voice was clear and strong, 
but with a tendency to simper, 
and she read with her chin held 
high, which made her neck appear more scrawny than it was, 
in the manner of an elocution 
student. 

"My period, you may remember," she said, "is the American 
Civil War, with its locale in the 
South." 

She read: 

"Oct. 13, 1862 — Mrs. Hampton 
sent her carriage for me today, 
with old Ned, one of her few remaining servants, driving, since 
most of the others have run off, 
leaving her quite destitute of 
help, a situation in which many 
of us also find oursefves . . ." 

Running away, thought Vickers, running away to the age of 
crinoline and chivalry, to a war 
from which time had swept away 
the blood and agony and made 
of its pitiful participants, both 
men and women, figures of pure 
romantic nostalgia. 

She read: "... Isabella was 
there and I was glad to see her. 
It had been years since we 'had 
met, that time back there, in Ala^ 
bama . . ." 

Fleeing, of course. And yet a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 




fleeing now turned into a readymade instrument to preach the 
gospel of that other world, the 
peaceful second world behind the 
scarred and tired Earth. 

No more than three weeks and 
they're already organized, Vickers thought, with the Georges to 
do the shouting and the running 
and occasionally the dying, and 



Sallys to do undercover work. 

And yet, even with the other 
world before them, even with the 
promise of the kind of life they 
seek, they still cling to the old 
nostalgic ritual of the magnoliascented past. It was the mark of 
suspicion upon them, refusing to 
give up the dream through fear 
that the actuality, if they reach




cd for it, would dissolve beneath 
their fingertips. 

Miss Stanhope read on: "J sat 
for an hour beside' old Mrs. 
Hampton's bed, reading Vanity 
Fair, a book of which she is fond, 
having read it herself, and having 
had it read to her since the onset 
of her infirmity, more times than 
she can remember." 




141 



"C<VEN if some of them still 
clung to the scented dream, 
there were others, the Georges 
among them, who would fight 
for the promise that they sensed 
in the second world. They would 
spread the word and they would 
flee the police when the sirens 
sounded and they would hide in 
the dark cellars and come out 
again when the police were gone. 

The world is safe, thought 
Vickers. It has been placed in 
hand that will guard and cherish 
it, that can do no other than 
guard and cherish it. 

Miss Stanhope read on and the 
old dowager sat behind the table, 
nodding her head a little drowsily, but with a firm grip still upon 
the letter opener, and all the 
others were listening, some of 
them politely, but most with consuming interest. When the reading was done, they would ask 
questions on points of research 
and pose other matters to be 
clarified and would make suggestions for the revision of the diary 
and would compliment Miss 
Stanhope upon the brilliance of 
her work. Then someone else 
would stand up and read about 
life in some other time and place 
and once again all of them would 
sit and listen and repeat the performance. 

Vickers felt the futility of it, 
the dread, dead hopelessness. It 
was as if the room were filled with 



the spice scent of many dusty 
years. 

When Miss Stanhope had finished and the room was stirring 
with the questions asked and the 
questions to be asked, he rose 
quietly from his chair and went 
out to the street. 

The stars were shining. 

Tomorrow he would go to see 
Ann Carter. 

And that was wrong, he knew. 
He shouldn't see her. 

XLIV 

TIE rang the bell and waited. 
XX When he heard her footsteps 
coming across the floor, he knew 
he should turn from the door and 
run. He had no right to come here 
and he knew he shouldn't have. 
There was no reason why he 
should see her at all, for the 
dream of her was dead as the 
dream of Kathleen. 

But he had had to come, literally had to. He had paused twice 
before the door of the apartment 
building and then had turned 
around and gone away again. 
This time he had not turned back, 
could not, but had gone in and 
now here he was, before her door, 
listening to the sound of footsteps 
coming toward him. 

And what, he wondered wildly, 
would he say to her when the 
door was opened? What would 
he do then? Go in as if nothing 



142 




 



at all had happened, as if they 
each were the same person they 
had been the last time they had 
met? 

Should he tell her she was a 
mutant and, more than that, an 
android, a manufactured woman? 

The door came open and she 
was a woman, as lovely as he 
remembered her, and she reached 
out a hand and drew him in and 
closed the door behind them and 
stood with her back against it. 

"Jay," she said. "Jay Vickers." 

He tried to speak, but he 
couldn't. He only stood there 
looking at her and thinking: It's 
a lie. It can't be true. 

"What happened. Jay? You 
said you would call me." 

He held out his arms, fighting 
not to, and she made a quick, 
almost desperate motion and was 
in them. He held her close against 
him and it was if the two of them 
stood in the final consolation of 
a misery which each had believed 
the other did not know. 

"I thought at first you were 
just a little crazy," she told him. 
"Remembering some of the things 
you said over the phone from that 
Wisconsin town, I was almost 
sure there was something wrong 
with you — that you'd gone off 
the beam. Then I got to remembering things, strange little things 
you had done or said or written 
and . . ." 

"Take it easy, Ann," he said. 



"You don't need to tell me." 

"Jay, have you ever wondered 
if you were quite human? If there 
might not be something in you 
that wasn't quite the usual pattern — something un human." 

"Yes," he said. "I've often 
wondered that." 

"I 'm sure you aren't. Not 
quite human, I mean. And that's 
all right. Because I'm not quite 
human, either." 

"CREELING her arms around 
him. he knew finally that 
here, clinging to one another, were 
two wan souls, lost and friendless 
in a sea of humanity. Neither of 
them had anyone but the other. 
Even if there were no love between them, they still must be as 
one and stand against the world. 

The telephone buzzed at them 
from its place upon the end table 
and they scarcely heard it. 

"I love you, Ann," he said, and 
a part of his brain that was not a 
part of him, but a cold, detached 
observer that stood off to one 
side, reminded him that he had 
known he could not love her, 
that it was impossible and immoral and preposterous to love 
someone who was closer than a 
sister, whose life had once been 
a part of his own and once more 
would blend with his life into 
another personality that might 
be unaware of them. 

"I remembered," Ann told him 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



143 



in a vague and distant voice. 
"And I haven't got it straight. 
Maybe you can help me get it 
straight." 

He asked, lips stiff with apprehension, "What did you remember, Ann?" 

"A walk I had with someone. 
I've tried, but I can't recall his 
name, although I'd know his face, 
even after' all these years. We 
walked down a valley, from a big 
brick house that stood on a hill. 
We walked down the valley and 
it was springtime because the 
wild crab apple blossoms were 
in bloom and there were singing 
birds and the funny thing about 
that walk is that I know I never 
took it. but I remember it. How 
can you remember something. 
Jay, when you know it never 
happened?" 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"Imagination, maybe. Something 
that you read somewhere." 

But this was it, he knew. This 
was the proof of what he had 
suspected. 

There were three of them , 
Flanders had said, three androids 
made out of one human life. The 
three of them had to be himself 
and Flanders and Ann Carter. 
Ann remembered the enchanted 
valley as he remembered it — but 
because he was a man, he had 
walked with a girl by the name 
of Kathleen Preston, and since 
Ann was a woman, she had walk


ed with a man whose name she 
could not recall. And when and 
if she did recall it, of course it 
would be wrong. For if he had 
walked with anyone, it had not 
been with a girl named Kathleen 
Preston, but a girl with some 
other name. 

"And that's not all," said Ann. 
"I know what other people think. 

"Please, Ann," he said. 

"I try not to know what they 
think, now that I realize that I 
can do it. I've been doing it, 
more or less unconsciously, all 
the time for years. Anticipating 
what people were about to say. 
Getting the jump on them. 
Knowing their objections before 
they even spoke them. Knowing 
what would appeal to them. I've 
been a good businesswoman, Jay, 
and that may be why I am. I 
can get into other people's minds. 
I did only the other day. When 
I first suspected that I could do 
it, I tried deliberately, just to 
see if I could or was imagining 
it. And I could. Jay, I could!" 

¥TE held her close and thought: 
Ann's one of the telepaths, 
one of those who can go out to 
the stars. 

"What are we, Jay?" she asked. 
"Tell me what we are." 

The telephone shrieked at 
them. 

"Later," he said. "It's not so 



144 




 



terribly frightening. In some ways 
it's wonderful. I came back because I loved you, Ann. I tried 
to stay away, but I couldn't. Because it isn't right . . ." 

"It's right," she almost sang. 
"Oh. Jay, it's the Tightest thing 
there ever was. I prayed that you 
would come back to me again. 
When I knew there was something wrong, I was afraid you 
wouldn't — that you might not be 
able to, that something awful 
might have happened to you. I 
prayed and the prayer was wrong 
because prayer was strange to 
me and I felt hypocritical and 
awful . . ." 

*T*HE ringing was a persistent 
snarl. 

"The phone," she said. 

He let her go and she walked 
to the davenport and sat down 
and took the receiver out of its 
cradle, while he stood and looked 
at the room and tried to bring it 
and Ann into focus with his 
memory. 

"It's for you," she said. 

"For me?" 

"Yes. Did anyone know you 
were coming here?" 

He shook his head, but took 
the receiver and stood with it in 
his hand, trying to guess who 
might be calling him and why. 
Wondering, he knew that he was 
scared, felt the sweat break out 
beneath his armpits and trickle 



down his ribs, because it could 
only be one person on the phone. 

A voice -said: "This is the Neanderthaler, Vickers." 

"Club and all?" asked Vickers. 

"Break out your spear," said 
Crawford. "We have a bone to 
chew." 

"At your office?" 

"There's a cab outside. It is 
waiting for you." 

"How long have you been 
tracking me?" 

Crawford chuckled. "Ever since 
Chicago. We have the country 
plastered with our analyzers." 

"Picking up much stuff?" 

"A few strays here and there." 

"Still confident about that secret weapon?" 

"Sure, I'm confident, but . . ." 

"Go ahead. You're talking to a 
friend." 

"I have to hand it to you, 
Vickers. Get over here fast." 

He hung up. Vickers took the 
receiver down from his ear and 
stared at it a moment, then 
placed it in the cradle. 

"That was Crawford," he said 
to Ann. "He wants to talk to 
me." 

"Is everything all right, Jay?" 
"Fine." 

"You'll come back?" 
"Well, of course." 
"You know what you are doing?" 

"Oh, yes," said Vickers. "I 
know what I'm doing now." 



RING AROUND THE SUN

XLV 

CRAWFORD motioned to the 
chair beside the desk. Vickers 
saw with a start that it was the 
same chair he'd sat in when he'd 
come to the office, only weeks 
ago, with Ann. 

"It's nice seeing you again," 
said Crawford. "I'm glad we can 
get together." 

"Your plans must be going 
well," Vickers said. "You are 
more affable than when I saw you 
last." 

"I'm always affable. Worried 
and afraid sometimes, but always 
affable." 

"You haven't picked up Ann 
Carter." 

Crawford shook his head. 
"There's no reason to. Not yet." 

"But you're watching her." 

"We're watching all of you. 
The few that are left." 

"Any time we want to, we can 
come unwatched." 

"I don't doubt it," Crawford 
admitted, "but why do you stick 
around? If I were a mutant, I 
wouldn't." 

"Because we have you licked 
and you're the one who knows 
it," said Vickers, wishing he were 
half as confident as he hoped he 
sounded. 

"We can start a war. All we 
have to do is lift a finger and the 
shooting begins." 

"You won't start it." 



. "You played your hand too 
hard. You're pushing us into war 
against our will as a last defense." 

"You mean the other world 
idea?" 

"Exactly," Crawford said. 

He sat and stared at Vickers 
with the pale blue bullet eyes 
peering out unemotionally from 
the rolls of flesh. 

"What do you think we'll do?" 
he asked. "Stand still and let 
you steamroller us? You tried 
the gadgets and we stopped them 
with, I admit, rather violent 
methods. So you tried an approach, a sort of religion, a piece 
of park bench fanaticism — tell 
me, Vickers, what do you call 
this business?" 

"The blunt truth," said Vickers. 

"No matter what it is, it's good. 
Too good. It'll take_ a war to 
stop it." 

"You'd call it subversive, I 
suppose." 

"It is subversive," Crawford 
said. "Already, just a few days 
since it started, it has shown results. People quitting their jobs, 
walking away from their homes, 
throwing away their money. 
Poverty, they said, that was the 
key to the other world. What 
kind of gag have you cooked up, 
Vickers?" 

"What happens to these people? The ones who quit their 
jobs and threw away their money 



146 




 



— have you kept a check on what 
happens to them?" 

CRAWFORD leaned forward 
in his chair. "That's the thing 
that scares us. Those people disappeared before we could round 
them up.'* 

"They went to the other 
world," said Vickers. 

"I don't know where they went, 
but I know what will happen if 
we let it continue. Our workers 
will leave us, a few at first and 
then more and more . . 

"If you want to turn on that 
war, start reaching for the button." 

"We won't let you do this to 
us," Crawford said. "We will stop 
you somehow. I told you about 
the analyzers. Well, they're everywhere. In railroad terminals, 
bus depots, hotel lobbies, eating 
joints . . ." 

"I thought as much. That's how 
you picked me up." 

"I warned you once before. 
Don't despise us because we're 
merely human, With an organization of world industry, you can 
do a lot of things and do them 
awfully fast." 

"You outsmart yourself," said 
Vickers. "You've found out a lot 
of things from those analyzers 
that you didn't want to know." 

"Like what?" 

"A lot of your industrialists 
and bankers and the others who 



are in your organization are really 
the mutants you are fighting." 

"I said I had to hand it to you. 
Would you mind telling me how 
you planted them?" 

"We didn't plant them, Crawford." 

"You didn't . . ." ■ 

"Let's take it from the start," 
said Vickers. "Let me ask you 
what a mutant is." 

"Why, I suppose he's an ordinary man who has some extra 
talents, an understanding of certain things that the rest of us 
can't grasp." 

"And suppose a man were a 
mutant and didn't know he was, 
but regarded himself as an ordinary man, what then? Where 
would he wind up? Doctor, lawyer, beggarman, thief? He'd wind 
up at the top of the heap. He'd 
be an eminent doctor or a smart 
attorney or an artist or a highly 
successful editor or writer. He 
might also be an industrialist or 
banker." 

The blue bullets of the eyes 
stared out from Crawford's face. 

"You," said Vickers, "have 
been heading up one of the finest 
group of mutants in the world today, men we couldn't touch because they were tied too closely 
to the normal world." 

"I know I have." 

"And what are you going to do 
about it, Crawford?" 

"Not a single thing. I'm not 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



147 



going to tell them." 
"Then I will." 

"No, you won't," said Crawford. "Because you, personally, 
are washed up. How do you think 
you've lived this long in spite of 
all the analyzers we have? I've 
let you, that's how." 

"You claimed you wanted to 
make a deal." 

"Not any more. You were an 
asset once. You're a danger 
now." 

"You're throwing me to the 
wolves?" 

"That's just what I'm doing. 
Good day, Mr. Vickers. It was 
nice knowing you." 

Vickers rose from the chair. 
"I'll see you again." 

"That," said Crawford, "is 
something I doubt." 

XLVI 




OING down the lift, Vickers 
thought furiously. 



It would take Crawford a little while to spread the word that 
he was unprotected, that anyone 
could pot him like a sitting duck. 

If it had only been himself, it 
would have been an easy matter, 
but Ann was involved. 

Ann, without a doubt, would 
become fair game, too, for now 
the chips were down and Crawford wasn't the kind of man who 
would play according to rules. 

Vickers had to reach Ann. 



Reach and tell her fast, keep her 
from asking questions and make 
her understand. 

At the ground floor, he stepped 
out with the other passengers and 
as he walked away, he saw the 
operator leave the elevator open 
and dash for a phone booth. 

Reporting me, he thought. 
There was an analyzer on the 
elevator and it made some sort of 
a signal that would go undetected 
to anyone but the operator. And 
there were other analyzers everywhere, Crawford had said, in 
railroad terminals and bus stations and eating places — anywhere that a man might go. 

Once one of the analyzers spotted a mutant, the word would be 
called in somewhere — to an exterminator squad, perhaps — and 
they would hunt the mutant 
down. Maybe they spotted him 
with portable analyzers, or maybe there were other ways to spot 
him, and once they spotted him, 
it would be all over. 

All over because the mutant 
would not know, because he 
would have no warning of the 
death that tracked him. Given a 
moment's notice, a moment to 
concentrate, he could disappear, 
as the mutants had disappeared 
at will when Crawford's men had 
tried to track them down for interview and parley. 

What was it Crawford had 
said? "You ring the bell and 




 



wait. You sit in a room and wait." 

But now the mutants seldom 
had a chance since they had no 
warning. 

Except that always before, 
when Jay Vickers had been spotted, he'd been known as one of 
the few who were not to be molested — he and Ann and maybe 
one or two others. 

But now it would be different. 
He was only another mutant, a 
hunted rat, just like all the 
others. 

TJE reached the sidewalk outside the building and stood 
for a moment, looking up and 
down the street. 

A cab, he thought, but there 
would be an analyzer in it. There 
would be analyzers everywhere. 
There must be one at Ann's 
apartment building. How else 
could Crawford have known so 
quickly that he had arrived 
there ? 

There was no way he could 
duck the analyzers, no way to 
hide or prevent them from knowing where he might be going. 

He stepped to the sidewalk's 
edge and hailed a cruising cab. It 
drew up and he stepped inside 
and gave the driver the address. 

The man threw a startled backward look at him. 

"You won't be in any trouble," 
said Vickers, "as long as you 
don't try anything." 



"It's all right, chum," the driver nervously told him. "I won't 
try a thing." 

"That's just fine," said Vickers. "Now let's go." 

He watched the blocks slide 
by, keeping an eye on the driver, 
watching for any motions that 
might be signals that there was 
a mutant in the taxi. The man 
made none and Vickers gradually 
relaxed. 

A thought struck him. What 
if they had gone immediately to 
Ann's apartment and had found 
her there and were waiting for 
him now? 

It was a risk, he decided, that 
he'd have to take a chance on. 

JXiHE cab stopped in front of 
the building and Vickers 
leaped out. The driver gunned 
the car, not waiting for the fare. 

Vickers ran toward the door, 
ignored the elevator, and went 
pounding up the stairs. 

He reached Ann's door and 
seized the knob and turned it, 
but the door was locked. He rang 
the bell and nothing happened. 
He rang it again and again. Then 
he backed to the opposite wall 
and hurled his body forward 
across the corridor, smashing at 
the door. He felt it give as the 
hinges were loosened. He backed 
up again. The third try and the 
door ripped away and sent him 
sprawling. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



149 



"Ann!" he shouted, leaping up. 

There was no answer. 

He went running through the 
rooms and found no one there. 

He .stood for a moment, sweat 
breaking out on him. 

Ann was gone! There was little 
time left to them and Ann was 
gone! 

He plunged out the door and 
went tearing down the stairs. 

When he reached the sidewalk, 
the cars were pulling up, three of 
them, one behind the other, and 
there were two more across the 
street. 

Men were piling out of it, men 
who carried guns. 

He tried to swing around to 
get back into the door again and 
bumped into someone. It was 
Ann, arms filled with shopping 
bags, and from one of the bags, 
he saw, protruded the leafy top 
of a bunch of celery. 

"Jay." she said, "what's going 
on? Who are all these men?" 

"Quick," he ordered, "get into 
my mind. The way you did the 
others. The way you know how 
people think." 

"But . . ." 

"Quick!" 

He felt her come into his mind, 
groping for his thoughts, fastening onto them. 

Something hit the stone wall 
of the building just above their 
heads and went twisting skyward 
with a shriek of- tortured metal. 



"Hang on," he said. "We're 
getting out of here." 

He closed his eyes and willed 
himself to the other earth, with 
all the urgency and will he could 
muster. He felt the tremor of 
Ann's mind and then he slipped 
and fell. He hit his head on 
something hard and stars wheeled 
inside his skull and something 
tore at his hand and something 
else fell on top of him. 

WHEN the stars cleared away, 
he heard the sound of wind 
blowing in the trees and there 
were no buildings. 

He lay flat upon his back, at 
the foot of a gray granite boulder. 
A bag of groceries, with the top 
of a bunch of celery sticking out 
of it, lay upon his stomach. 
He sat up. 
"Ann," he called. 
"Here I am," she said. 
"You all right?" 
"Physically, yes, but not mentally. What happened? Where 
did we go to?" 

"We fell off that boulder," 
Vickers told her. 

He stood up and reached down 
a hand to help her to her feet. 

"But the boulder, Jay! Where 
I live?" 

"We're in the second world," 
said Vickers. 

They stood together and looked 
across the land — wild, desolate, 
wooded, with scattered rocks and 



150 




 



granite ledges sticking from the 
hilt slopes. 

"The second world," repeated 
Ann dazedly. "That crazy stuff 
that's been in the papers?" 

Vickers nodded gravely. 
"There's nothing crazy about it, 
Ann. It exists." 

"I'll take your word for it." 
She paused to grow practical. 
"Well, we brought our dinner 
with us. Help me pick up these 
groceries." 

Vickers got down on hands and 
knees to chase down the potatoes that had escaped from the 
sack. It had split wide open in 
the tumble from the boulder.

IT was Manhattan as it must 
have appeared before the 
white man came, finally to build 
upon it the Man-made half-wonder, half-monstrosity. But now it 
was a world unspoiled. 

"And yet," said Vickers, "there 
must be something here. The mutants would have to have some 
sort of supply depot to store the 
stuff they'd want to funnel to 
New York." 

"And if they haven't?" 
He looked at her and grinned 
wryly. "How are you at travel?" 
"All the way to Chicago?" 
"Farther than Chicago," he 
told her. "On foot. Although we 
might rig up a raft when we hit 



a westward-flowing river." 

"There'd be other mutant centers." 

"I suppose there would be, but 
we might not be lucky enough to 
stumble on one of them." 

She shook her head at him. 
"This is all so strange." 

"Not strange," he said. "Just 
sudden. If we'd had the time, I'd 
have explained — prepared you — 
but we didn't." 

"J a y> they were shooting at 
us." 

Vickers nodded grimly. "They 
play for keeps." 

"But they're human beings, 
Jay. Just like us." 

"Not like us," said Vickers. 
"Only human. That's the trouble 
with them. Being human in this 
day isn't quite enough." He 
tossed two or three pieces of 
wood on the campfire. 

"Come on, let's go," he said. 

"But it's getting dark." 

"If there's anything on the 
island, we'll spot it by the lights. 
Just up on that hill. If we don't 
see anything, we'll come back. 
When morning comes, we can 
look again." 

"Jay," she said, "in lots of 
ways, it's just like a picnic.'' 

"I'm no good at riddles. Tell 
me why it's like a picnic." 

"Why, the fire and eating in 
the open and . . ." 

"Forget it," Vickers stated. 
"We're not on any picnic."

HE moved ahead and she followed close behind him, 
threading their way between the 
thickets and the boulders. Night 
hawks skimmed the air above 
them in graceful, insect-catching 
swoops. From somewhere far off 
came the wickering of a coon. 
A few lightning bugs flashed on 
and off, dancing in the bushes. 

They climbed the hill, not very 
high, but fairly steep, and when 
they reached the top they saw 
the lights, far down toward the 
island's tip, 

"There it is," said Vickers. "I 
figured they would have to be 
here." 

"It's a long way off. Will we 
have to walk it?" 

"Maybe not." 

"But how . . ." 

"And you a telepath." 

She shook her head. "I don't 
understand." 

"Go on and try," said Vickers. 
"Just want to talk to someone 
down there." 

And he remembered Flanders, 
rocking on the porch and saying 
that distance should be no bar 
to telepathy, that a mile or a 
light-year should not make the 
slightest difference. 

"You think I can?" 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"You don't want to walk, do 
you?" 

"Not that far." 

"Then give it a try." 



They stood silently, looking 
toward the small area of light in 
the gathering darkness. He tried 
to pick out the different locations. 
There was where Rockefeller 
Center was located back on the 
old Earth, and up there Central 
Park and down there, where the 
East River curved in, the old 
abandoned United Nations structure. But the areas were covered 
with grass and trees instead of 
concrete and asphalt. 

"Jay!" Her whisper was tense 
with excitement. 

"Yes, Ann." 

"I think I have someone." 

"A man or a woman?" 

"Good heavens, neither! He 
says he's a robot! He says he'll 
send someone — no, not someone 
— something for us." * 

"Ann . . ." 

"He says for us to wait right 
here. They'll be right along." 

"Ann, ask him if they can make 
movies." 

"Movies?" 

"Motion pictures. Have they 
got cameras and film?" 

"But what do you . . ." 

"Just go ahead and ask him." 

"He says they can." 

"That's fine," said Vickers. 

"But motion pictures?" 

"I have an idea we can lick 
Crawford yet." 

"Oh, no, you aren't going 
back!" 

"You bet I am."

"Jay Vickers, I won't let you!" 

"You can't stop me," Vickers 
said. "Here, let's sit down and 
wait to be picked up." 

THEY sat down, close together. 
"I have a story," Vickers 
said. "It's about a boy. His name 
was Jay Vickers and he was very 
young ..." He stopped abruptly. 

"Go on," she said. "I'd like to 
hear your story." 
"Some other time." 
"I want to hear it now." 
"Not when a moon is coming 
up," said Vickers. "That's no 
time for stories." 

And he wondered : Can I ever 
tell her that We are closer than 
she thinks, that we came from 
the same life and will go back 
to the same body and that we 
cannot love one another? 

She leaned against him and put 
her head against his shoulder and 
looked up at the sky. 

"It's getting clearer," she said, 
"not so strange now. Queer as it 
may be, it seems right. This other 
world and the things we have, 
those strange abilities and all and 
the strange remembering." 

He put his arm around her and 
she turned her head and gave him 
a quick, impulsive kiss. 

"We'll be happy," she said. 
"The two of us in this new 
world." 

And now, he knew, he could 
never tell her. 



XLVIII 

A GIRL'S voice answered the 
telephone and Vickers asked 
for Crawford. 

"Mr. Crawford is in conference," she said. "He cannot be 
disturbed." 

"Tell him this is Vickers." 

"Mr. Crawford cannot be . . . 
Did you say Vickers? Jay Vickers?" 

"That's right. I have news for 
him." 

"Just a minute, Mr. Vickers." 

He waited, wondering how long 
he might have, for the analyzer 
in the phone booth must have 
sounded the alarm and the exterminator squad must be on the 
way. 

Crawford's voice said, "Hello, 
* Vickers." 

"Call off your dogs," said 
Vickers. "They're wasting your 
time and theirs." 

He heard the rage in Crawford's voice. "I thought I told 
you — " 

"Take it easy. You haven't got 
a chance of potting me. Your 
men couldn't do it when they had 
me cornered.. So if you can't kill 
me, you better dicker with me." 

"Dicker?" 

"That's what I said." 
"Listen, Vickers, I'm not — " 
"Of course you will," said 
Vickers. "That other world business is really rolling now and

you are getting hurt. It's time 
you talked sense." 

''I'm tied up with my directors," Crawford said. 

"That's fine. They're the ones 
I really want to talk to." 

"Vickers, no matter what you're 
.planning, you'll never get away 
with it. You can't leave here 
alive. I can't save you if you 
keep up this foolishness." 

"I'm not going away." 

"I like you, Vickers. I don't 
know why. I certainly have no 
reason to . . ." 

"I'm coming up." 

"All right," said Crawford 
wearily. "Do what you want. It's 
your funeral." 

Vickers picked up the film case 
and stepped out of the booth. An 
elevator car was waiting and he 
walked swiftly toward it, shoulders hunched a little against the 
anticipated bullet in the back. 

"Third floor," he said. 

The elevator operator didn't 
bat an eye. The analyzer by nov? 
must have given its signal, but 
more than likely the operator 
had his instructions on third floor 
passengers. 

"1TICKERS opened the door to 
" North American Research and 

Crawford was waiting for him in 

the reception room. 

"Come on," said Crawford 
He turned and marched ahead 

and Vickers followed him down 



the long hall. He looked at his 
watch and did fast mental arithmetic. It was going better than 
he'd hoped. He still had a margin 
of two or three minutes. It hadn't 
taken as long to convince Crawford as he had thought it might. 

Ann would be calling in ten 
minutes. What happened in that 
time would decide success or failure. 

Crawford stopped in front of 
the door at the end of the hall. 

"You know what you are doing, Vickers?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"One slip and . . ." Crawford 
made a hissing sound between his 
teeth and sliced a finger across 
his throat. 

"I understand," said Vickers. 

"Those men in there are the 
desperate ones. There still is time 
to leave. I won't tell them you 
were here." 

"Cut out the stalling, Crawford." 

"What have you got there?" 

"Some documentary film. It 
will help explain what I have to 
say. You've got a projector inside?" 

Crawford nodded. "But no operator." 

"IH run the machine myself." 
"A deal?" 

"A solution," Vickers said. 
"All right, then. Come in." 
The shades were drawn and 
the room was twilit and the long 



154 




 



table at which the men sat 
seemed to be no more than a row 
of white faces turned toward 
them. 

Vickers followed Crawford 
across the room, feet sinking into 
the heavy carpeting. He looked 
at the men around the table and 
saw that many of them were public figures. 

There, at Crawford's right 
hand, was a banker, and beyond 
him a man who had often been 
called to the White House to be 
entrusted semi -diplomatic missions. And there were others also 
that he recognized, although there 
were many that he didn't, and a 
few of them wore the strange 
dress of other lands.. 

Here was the directorate of 
North American Research, those 
men who guided the destiny of 
the embattled normals against 
the mutant menace — Crawford's 
desperate men. 

"A strange thing has happened, 
gentlemen," said Crawford. "A 
most unsual thing. We have a 
mutant with us." 

IN the silence, the white faces 
flickered around at Vickers, 
then turned back again. 

"Mr. Vickers," Crawford went 
on, "is an acquaintance of some 
standing. You will recall that we 
have talked of him before. At 
one time, we hoped he might be 
able to help us reconcile the dif


ferences between the two branch 
es of the human race. 

"He comes to us of his own 
accord and has indicated to me 
that he may have a possible solution. He has not told me what 
that solution might be. I brought 
him directly here. It's up to you. 
of course, whether you want to 
hear what he has to say." 

"Why, certainly," said one of 
them. "Let the man talk." 

And another said, "Most happy 
to." 

The others nodded their agreement. 

Crawford said to Vickers, "The 
floor is yours." 

Vickers walked to the table's 
head and he was thinking: So 
far, so good. Now if only the rest 
works out. If I don't make a slip. 
If I can carry it off. Because it 
was win or lose; there was no 
middle ground. 

He set the film case on the 
table and said, "No infernal weapon, gentlemen. It's a film that, 
with your permission, I'll show 
you in just a little while." 

They simply sat and looked at 
him and there was nothing that 
you could read in their faces, but 
he felt the coldness of their hatred. 

"You're about to start a war," 
he said. "You're meeting here to 
decide if you should reach out 
and turn oh the tap . . ." 

The white faces seemed to be

leaning forward, all of them 
straining toward him. 

'One of them said: "You're 
either a brave man, Vickers, or 
an absolute idiot." 

"I've come here," said Vickers, "to end the war before it 
starts." 

REACHING into his pocket, 
Vickers' hand came out in a 
nicking motion and tossed the 
thing it held onto the table. 

"That's a top," he said. "A 
thing that kids play with — or 
used to play, at any rate. I want 
to talk to you for a minute about 
a top." 

"A top?" raged someone. "Is 
he trying to make fools of us?" 

But the banker across the table 
said rem ini scent ly, "I had a top 
like that when I was a boy. They 
don't make them any more. I 
haven't seen one of them in 
years." 

He reached out a hand and 
picked up the top and spun it on 
the table. The others craned their 
necks to look at it. 

Vickers glanced at his watch. 
Still on schedule. Now if nothing 
spoiled it! 

"You remember the top, Crawford?" asked Vickers. "The one 
that was in my hotel room that 
night you unexpectedly dropped 
in on me?" 

"I remember it." said Crawford. 



"You spun it and it vanished." 

"And it came back again." 

"Crawford, why did you spin 
that top?" 

Crawford licked his lips in embarrassment. "Why, I don't 
know. It might have been an attempt to rescue a lost memory, 
an urge to be a boy again." 

"You asked me what the top 
was for." 

"You told me it was for going 
into fairyland and I told you that 
a week before I would have said 
that we were, crazy — you for 
saying a thing like that and I 
for listening to you." 

"But before I came in, you 
spun the top. Tell me, Crawford, 
why did you do it?" 

"Go ahead," the banker urged. 
"Tell him." 

"I did," said Crawford. "I just 
told you the reason." 

Behind Vickers, a door opened. 
He turned his head and saw a 
secretary beckoning to Crawford. 

i"VN time, Vickers thought. 

Working like a charm. Ann 
was on the phone and Crawford 
was being called from the room 
to talk to her. And that was the 
way he'd planned it, for with 
Crawford in the room, the plan 
would be hopeless. 

"Mr. Vickers," the banker said, 
"I'm curious about this business 
of the top. What connection is 
there between a top and the prob


156 




 



Icm that we face?" 

"A sort of analogy," replied 
Vickers. "There are certain basic 
differences between the normals 
and the mutants and I can explain them best by the use of a 
top. But before I do, I'd like you 
to see my film. After that I can 
go ahead and tell you and you 
will understand me. If you gentlemen will excuse me?" 

He lifted the film case from the 
table. 

"Why, certainly," the banker 
said. "Go right ahead." 

Vickers went back to the stairs 
which led to the projection booth, 
opened the door and went inside. 

He'd have to work fast and 
surely, for Ann could not hold 
Crawford on the phone very long 
and she had to keep Crawford 
out of the room for at least five 
minutes. 

He slid the film into the folder 
and threaded it through the 
lenses with shaking fingers and 
clipped it on the lower spool and 
then swiftly checked what he had 
done. 

Everything seemed all right. 

He found the switches and 
turned them on and the cone of 
light sprang out to spear above 
the conference table. On the 
screen before the table was a 
brilliantly colored top, spinning, 
with the stripes moving up and 
disappearing, moving up and disappearing — 



The film track said: "Here you 
see a top, a simple toy, but it 
presents one of the most baffling 
illusions . . ." 

The words were right, Vickers 
knew. Robotic experts had spent 
days picking out the right words, 
weaving them together, with just 
th e right rel ationship, j ust the 
right inflection, to give them 
maximum semantic value. The 
words would hold the audience, 
fix their interest on the top, and 
keep it there after the first few 
seconds. 

He came silently down the 
stairs and moved over to the door. 
If Crawford should come back, 
he could hold him off until the 
job was done. 

HPHE film track said: "Now if 
you will watch closely, you 
will see that the lines of color 
seem to move up the body of the 
top and disappear. A child, 
watching the lines of color, might 
wonder where they went, and so 
might anyone . . ." 

He tried to count the seconds 
off and the seconds dragged. 

The film track said: "Watch 
closely now — watch closely. They 
come up and disappear, they 
come up and disappear — " 

There were not nearly so many 
men at the table, only two or 
three now, and they were watching so closely that they had not 
even noticed the others disap

pear. Maybe those two or three 
would stay. Of them all, these 
few might be the only ones who 
weren't unsuspecting mutants. 

Vickers opened the door softly 
and slid out and closed it behind 
him. 

The door shut out the soft 
persuasive voice of the film tract : 
"Come up and disappear- — watch 



Why did you spin that top?" 

Crawford shook his head. "I 
can't understand it, Vickers. It 
doesn't make any sense, but I 
went into fairyland once myself. 
Just like you, when I was a kid. 
I remembered it after I talked 
to you. Maybe because I talked 
to you. I sat on the floor and 
watched the top spin and won

Crawford was coming down 
the hall, lumbering along. 

He saw Vickers and stopped. 

"What do you want?" he 
asked. "What are you out here 
for?" 

"A question," Vickers said, 
"one you didn't answer in there.

up and disappear and then another one comes up and disappears. I wondered where they 
went and I got so interested that 
I must have followed them, because all at once I was in fairyland and there were a lot of

Ann had within her the life of 
that girl who had walked the 
valley with him — the girl he remembered as Kathleen Preston, 
but who had some other name. 
For Ann remembered the valley 
and that she had walked the 
valley in the springtime with 
someone by her side. 

There might be more than Ann. 
There might be three of Ann just 
as there were three of him, but 
that didn't matter, either. Maybe 
Ann's name really was Ann Carter as his really was Jay Vickers. 
Maybe that meant that, when the 
lives drained back into the rightful bodies, it would be his consciousness and Ann's that would 
survive. 

And it was all right now to 
love Ann. She was a separate 
person and not a part of him. 

Ann had come into this world 
to place a telephone call and to 
get Crawford from the room, so 
that he would not recognize the 
danger of the top spinning on 
screen, and now she'd gone back 
to the other world again and the 
threat was gone. 

"Everything's all right," said 
Vickers. "Everything's just fine." 

Soon he'd be going back himself and Ann would be waiting for 
him. And they'd be happy, the 
way she had said they'd be, sitting there on a Manhattan hilltop 
waiting for the robots. 



"Well, then," said Crawford, 
"let's go back in again." 

Vickers "put out his hand to 
stop him. "There's no use going 
in." 

"No use?" 

"Your directors aren't there," 
said Vickers. "They're in the second world. The one, you remember, that the Pretentionists 
preached about in the squares all 
over town." 

CRAWFORD stared at him. 
"The top!" 
"That's right." 

"We'll start again," said Crawford: "Another board, another ..." 

"You haven't got the time. 
This Earth is done. The people 
are fleeing from it. Even those 
who stay won't listen to you, 
won't fight for you." 

"I'll kill you," Crawford said. 
"I'll kill you, Vickers." 

"No, you won't." 

They stood face to face silently, tensely. 

"No," said Crawford. "No, I 
guess I won't. I should, but I 
can't. Why can't I kill you, Vickers?" 

Vickers touched the big man's 
arm. 

"Come on, friend," he said 
softly. "Or should I call you 
brother?"
