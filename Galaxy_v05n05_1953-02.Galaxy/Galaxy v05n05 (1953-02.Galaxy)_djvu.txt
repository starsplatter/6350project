SEEDS DF LIFE 

By JOHN TAINE 

'SEEDS OF LIFE is Science fiction of a high order, a novel involving believable people in unusual situations. 



THOUGHT of the atomic bomb and what exposure to its radiations might do has excited the imagination of thinking men 
and women everywhere. 

"John Taine" (who is Dr. E. T. Bell of the California Institute 
of Technology) has permitted his imagination to investigate some 
of the possibilities in a similar fascinating theme. This is not a 
story involving the atomic bomb, however. Atomic energy is part 
of the story, but only an incidental part, as are such unlikely 
ingredients as a black widow spider, a two-million volt X-ray 
tube, chicken eggs which hatch out reptilian monsters, and other 
equally strange plot threads. Dr. Bell has again displayed his 
usual ability to write about the unusual. 

When Dr. Andrew Crane of the Erickson Foundation tries to 
make a man of Neils Bark, his laboratory assistant, he succeeds 
in a spectacular manner. Bork himself contributes to 'he end 
result in his bungling way, and there emerges Miguel De Soto, a 
superman in every sense of the word. His rate of thinking and 
perceiving has accelerated many thousand times beyond that of 
any human being who has ever lived. He is a partial, accidental 
anticipation of the race man may be destined to became in the 
millenniums ahead. 

SEEDS OF LIFE is written in the smoothly entertaining style 
which characterizes all of Dr. Bell's work, including such wellknown books as "The Magic Numbers," "The Forbidden Garden," 
"The Iron Star," "Before the Dawn," "Mathematics, Queen and 
Servant of Science," and his many "John Taine" science novels. 
And it is adult reading fare, realistic, gripping and informative. 
Above all it is good entertainment.

l^EVER in the entire history of 

™ civilization have there been 
so many toys, play costumes and 
amusements for children. 

It's an alarming situation. 

And why not? It's alarmed all 
other generations in the past ; 
there's no reason why we should 
be spared. 

The lessons of history should 
help, but they never do. No generation has yet known how to 
cope with the problem. 

But we can try, can't we? Let's 
(as) rationally and objectively 
(as possible) scrounge around in 
the past in order to understand 
the present and anticipate the 
headaches our kids will inevitably have with their own kids. 

For one thing, no matter how 
far back we go, the pattern remains identical: 

Parents invariably give their 
children more toys and games 
than they had when they were 
youngsters. The children then 
have (at least it seems so to 
parents) everything to play with 
and nothing to play. The plaintive "What should I do now?" 
brings forth the outraged "Why, 
when I was your age — " 

What comes after that gambit 
forms an oral record of the human race: 

" — We didn't have wooden 
wheels to roll, just fire to play 
with." 



" — I wasn't allowed to have 
any shrunken heads until I was 
old enough to go out and hunt 
for them." 

" — I wouldn't even dare ask 
my father for a slave of my own." 

" — We didn't have bows — '* 

' ' — arquebuses — ' 1 

" — ducking stools — " 

" — stagecoaches — " 

" — railroad trains — " 

" — airplanes — " 

And now, of course, it's all the 
paraphernalia in miniature of the 
Old West, crime, war, the Atomic 
Age and space exploration. 

Very few adults have ever 
been able to resist delivering the 
why -when-I- was -your -age lecture. Having done my own share, 
I wonder what drives us to it. 
Partly exasperation, of course, 
but it must be mostly envy 
camouflaged by recollections of 
deprivation bravely borne. 

The deprivation is obviously 
in the present, since one does 
not feel deprived of something 
that doesn't yet exist. We had 
our soapbox cars and other 
makeshift toys, including discarded eggbeaters and such from 
the kitchen, and we never suspected or missed the dazzlesome 
gadgets of today. Even if we had, 
though, we'd have kept it to ourselves; we'd only have been inviting still more tiring reminders 
of how much harder our elders' 



2 




 



childhoods were than ours. 

Envy seems a mean emotion 
for an adult to have, but it 
shouldn't need an apology. Older 
generations as a rule did have 
less in their youth and, remembering that little and contrasting 
it with the next generation's 
engorgement, they couldn't possibly see how a child could own 
so many things and yet not know 
what to play with. 

Naturally, we've outgrown the 
desire for toys, but here is the 
blunt truth — we wish we'd had 
them as children. Perhaps that 
envy is more visible in the case 
of books. At any rate, it is to me, 
because I recall digging doggedly 
along the bookshelves of public 
libraries in search of science fiction, of which there was hardly 
any and that bit hidden well 
among general titles, whereas 
children now are inundated with 
the stuff. Instead of having to 
hunt, they have to dodge. 

What with toys, books, magazines, comics, radio, TV, movies 
and everything else, it does seem 
as if we have more to contend 
with and envy than any previous 
generation. 

But what will our children 
face? The thought that they'll 
tell their children how little they 
had to play with may seem preposterous, but is it? 

Toys are an excellent index to 
a civilization; they're non-func


tioning replicas of devices in 
common use — as a rule. The exception, of course, is the element 
of fantasy in play and playthings. 
If an alien race tried to analyze 
our civilization via toys and 
books, it would have to conclude 
that we have space travel, disintegrator rays and so forth. 

As technology advances and 
the number of gadgets increases, 
so must playthings become more 
numerous and complex. It would 
be absurd to expect one without 
the other. Also, barring an absolutely unthinkable racial catastrophe, it would be absurd to 
expect the process to do anything 
but accelerate. 

What will our grandchildren 
play with? To know that, you'd 
have to be able to outguess 
progress. But you may be sure 
that toys will ar the very least 
keep abreast of science and exploration. 

Now add to that fact the certainty that we'll reach other 
planets within a single generation. 
Lord knows what we'll find there 
in the way of artifacts, pets and 
plants. But whatever we find, the 
kids of that day will have either 
as imports or imitations. 

I feel sorry in advance for their 
parents, who'll yelp in vexation, 
"A whole solar menagerie and 
you don't know what to play 
with? Why, when I was your 
age—" — H. L. GOLD

George realized he was tucky. He fell into

to become completely absorbed in his work!

tions. For example, he was almost certain that the distance 
between his visual center and his 
eyes was now at least thirty centimeters. Also, no doubt, the system as a whole was curled up and 
spread out rather oddly, since the 
musculature it had originally 
controlled was gone; and he had 
noticed certain other changes 
which might or might not be reflected by gross structural differences. The fact remained that he 
— all that he could still call himself — was nothing more than a 
brain, a pair of eyes, a spinal 
cord, and a spray of neurons. 

George closed his eyes for a 
second. It was a feat he had 
learned to do only recently and 
he was proud of it. That first 
long period, when he had had no 
control whatever, had been very 
bad. He had decided later that 
the paralysis had been due to 
the lingering effects of some anesthetic — the agent, whatever it 
was, that had kept him unconscious while his body was — 

Well. 

Either that or the neuron 
branches had simply not yet knitted firmly in their new positions. 
Perhaps he could verify one or 
the other supposition at some 
future time. But at first, when he 
had only been able to see and not 
to move, knowing nothing beyond the moment when he had 
fallen face-first into that mottled 



green and brown puddle of gelatin . . . that had been upsetting. 

TIE wondered how the others 
XX W ere taking it. There were 
others, he knew, because occasionally he would feel a sudden 
acute pain down where his legs 
used to be, and at the same 
instant the motion of the landscape would stop with a jerk. 
That could only be some other 
brain, trapped like his, trying to 
move their common body in another direction. 

Usually the pain stopped immediately, and George could go 
on sending messages down to the 
nerve-endings which had formerly belonged to his fingers and 
toes, and the gelatinous body 
would go on creeping slowly forward. When the, pains continued, 
there was nothing to do but stop 
moving until the other brain quit 
— in which case George would 
feel like an unwilling passenger in 
a very slow vehicle — or try to 
alter his own movements to coincide, or at least produce a 
vector with the other brain's. 

He wondered who else had 
fallen in. Vivian Bellis? Major 
Gumbs? Miss McCarty? All 
three of them? There ought to 
be some way of finding out. 

He tried looking down once 
more and was rewarded with a 
blurry view of a long, narrow 
strip of mottled green and brown,

moving sluggishly along the dry 
stream bed they had been crossing for the last hour or more. 
Twigs and shreds of dry vegetable matter were stuck to the 
dusty, translucent surface. 

He was improving ; the last 
time, he had only been able to 
see the thinnest possible edge of 
his new body. 

When he looked up again, the 
far side of the stream bed was 
perceptibly closer. There was a 
cluster of stiff -looking, darkbrown vegetable shoots just beyond, on the rocky shoulder; 
George was aiming slightly to the 
left of it. It had been a plant 
very much like that one that he'd 
been reaching for when he lost 
his balance and got himself into 
this situation. 

He might as well have a good 
look at it, anyhow. 

The plant would probably turn 
out to be of little Interest. It 
would be out of all reasfcm to 
expect every new life-form to be 
a startling novelty; and George 
Meister was convinced that he 
had already stumbled into the 
most interesting organism on this 
planet. Something-or-other meisrer/7, he thought, named after 
him, of course. He had not settled on a generic term — he would 
have to learn more about it before he decided — but meisterii 
certainly. It was his discovery 
and nobody could take it away 



from him. Or, unhappily, him 
away from it. Ah, well! 

TT was a really lovely organism, 
though. Primitive- — less structure of its own than a jellyfish, 
and only on a planet with light 
surface gravity like this one could 
it ever have hauled itself up out 
of the sea. No brain, no nervous 
system at all, apparently. But it 
had the perfect survival mechanism. It simply let its rivals 
develop highly organized nervous tissue, sat in one place 
(looking exactly like a deposit 
of leaves and other clutter) until 
one of them fell into it, and then 
took all the benefit. 

It wasn't parasitism, either. It 
was a true symbiosis, on a higher 
level than any other planet, so 
far as George knew, had ever 
developed. The captive brain was 
nourished by the captor; wherefore it served the captive's interest to move the captor toward 
food and away from danger. 
You steer me, / feed you. It was 
fair. 

They were close to the plant, 
almost touching it. George inspected it. As he had thought, it 
was a common grass type. 

Now his body was tilting itself 
up a ridge he knew to be low, 
although from his eye-level it 
looked tremendous. He climbed 
it laboriously and found himself 
looking down into still another 



FOUR IN ONE 



7 



gully. This could probably go on 
indefinitely. The question was — 
did he have any choice? 

He looked at the shadows cast 
by the low-hanging sun. He was 
heading approximately northwest, directly away from the encampment. He was only a few 
hundred meters away; even at a 
crawl, he could make the distance easily enough ... if he 
turned back. 

He felt uneasy at the thought 
and didn't know why. Then it 
struck him that his appearance 
was not obviously that of a human being in distress. The 
chances were that he looked like 
a monster which had eaten and 
partially digested one or more 
people. 

If he crawled into camp in his 
present condition, it was a certainty that he would be shot at 
before any questions were asked, 
and only a minor possibility that 
narcotic gas would be used instead of a machine rifle. 

No, he decided, he was on the 
right course. The idea was to get 
away from camp, so that he 
wouldn't be found by the relief 
party which was probably searching for him now. Get away, bury 
himself in the forest, and study 
his new body : find out how it 
worked and what he could do 
with it, whether there actually 
were others in it with him, and if 
so, whether there was any way 



of communicating with them. 

It would take a long time, he 
realized, but he could do it. 

Limply, like a puddle of mush 
oozing over the edge of a tablecloth, George started down into 
the gully. 

¥>RIEFLY, the circumstances 
leading up to George's fall 
into the Sornething-or-other me/sterii were as follows: 

Until as late as the mid-twenty-first century, a game invented 
by the ancient Japanese was still 
played by millions in the eastern 
hemisphere of earth. The game 
was called go. Although its rules 
were almost childishly simple, its 
strategy included more permutations and was more difficult to 
master than chess. 

Go was played at the height of 
development — just before the 
geological catastrophe that wiped 
out most of its devotees— on a 
board with nine hundred shallow 
holes, using small pill-shaped 
counters. At each turn, one of 
the two players placed a counter on the board, wherever he 
chose, the object being to capture as much territory as possible 
by surrounding it completely. 

There were no other rules; and 
yet it had taken the Japanese 
almost a thousand years to work 
up to that thirty-by-thirty board, 
adding perhaps one rank and file 
per century. A hundred years 



8 




 



was not too long to explore all 
the possibilities of that additional 
rank and file. 

At the time George Meister 
fell into the gelatinous green-andbrown monster, toward the end 
of the twenty-third century 
A. D., a kind of go was being 
played in a three - dimensional 
field which contained more than 
ten billion positions. The Galaxy 
was the board, the positions were 
star-systems, men were the counters. The loser's penalty was annihilation. 

The Galaxy was in the process 
of being colonized by two opposing federations, both with the 
highest aims and principles. In 
the early stages of this conflict, 
planets had been raided, bombs 
dropped, and a few battles had 
even been fought by fleets of 
spaceships. Later, that haphazard 
sort of warfare became impossible. Robot fighters, carrying 
enough armament to blow each 
other into dust, were produced 
by the trillion. In the space 
around the outer stars of a cluster belonging to one side or the 
other, they swarmed like minnows. 

Within such a screen, planets 
were safe from attack and from 
any interference with their commerce . . , unless the enemy succeeded in colonizing enough of 
the surrounding star-systems to 
set up and maintain a second 



screen outside the first. It was go, 
played for desperate stakes and 
under impossible conditions. 

Everyone was in a hurry; everyone's ancestors for seven generations had been in a hurry. 
You got your education in a 
speeded-up, capsulized form. You 
mated early and bred frantically. 
And if you were assigned to an 
advance ecological team, as 
George was, you had to work 
without proper preparation. 

The sensible, the obvious thing 
to do in opening up a new planet 
with unknown life-forms would 
have been to begin with at least 
ten years of immunological study 
conducted from the inside of a 
sealed station. After the worst 
bacteria and viruses had been 
conquered, you might proceed to 
a little cautious held work and 
exploration. Finally — total 
elapsed time fifty years, say — 
the colonists would be shipped in. 

There simply wasn't that much 
time. 

FIVE hours after the landing, 
Meister's team had unloaded 
fabricators and set up barracks 
enough to house its 2,628 members. 

An hour after that, Meister, 
Gumbs, Bellis and McCarty had 
started out across the level cinder and ash left by the transport's tail jets to the nearest 
living vegetation, six hundred 



FOUR IN ONE 



9 



meters away. They were to trace 
a spiral path outward from the 
camp site to a distance of a thousand meters, and then return 
with their specimens — providing 
nothing too large and hungry to 
be stopped by machine rifle had 
previously eaten them. 

Meister, the biologist, was so 
hung down with collecting boxes 
that his slender torso was totally 
invisible. Major Gumbs had a 
survival kit, binoculars and a 
machine rifle. Vivian Bellis, who 
knew exactly as much mineralogy as had been contained in the 
three-month course prescribed 
for her rating, and no more, carried a light rifle, a hammer and a 
specimen sack. Miss McCarty — 
no one knew her first name — had 
no scientific function. She s was 
the group's Loyalty Monitor. She 
wore two squat pistols and a 
bandolier bristling with cartridges. Her only job was to blow 
the cranium off any team member caught using an unauthorized communicator, or in any 
other way behaving oddly. 

All of them were heavily 
gloved and booted, and their 
heads were covered by globular 
helmets, sealed to their tunic 
collars. They breathed through 
filtered respirators, so finely 
meshed that — in theory — nothing 
larger than an oxygen mdlecule 
could get through. 

On their second circuit of the 



camp, they had struck a low 
ridge and a series of short, steep 
gullies, most of them choked with 
the dusty-brown stalks of dead 
vegetation. As they started down 
into one of these, George, who 
was third in line — Gumbs leading, then Bellis, and McCarty 
behind George — stepped out onto 
a protruding slab of stone to examine a cluster of plant stalks 
rooted on its far side. 

His weight was only a little 
more than twenty kilograms on 
this planet, and the slab looked 
as if it were firmly cemented 
into the wall of the gully. Just 
the same, he felt it shift under 
him as soon as his weight was 
fully on it. He found himself 
falling, shouted, and caught a 
flashing glimpse of Gumbs and 
Bellis, standing as if caught by a 
high-speed camera. He heard a 
rattling of stones as he went by. 
Then he saw what looked like a 
shabby blanket of leaves and dirt 
floating toward him, and he remembered thinking, It looks like 
a soft landing, anyhow. . . . 

That was all, until he woke up 
feeling as if he had been prematurely buried, with no part of him 
alive but his eyes. 

MUCH later, his frantic efforts to move had resulted in 
the first fractional success. From 
then on, his field of vision had 
advanced fairly steadily, per


10 




 



haps a meter every fifty minutes, 
not counting the times when 
someone else's efforts had interfered with his own. 

His conviction that nothing 
remained of the old George Meister except a nervous system was 
not supported by observation, 
but the evidence was regrettably 
strong. To begin with, the anesthesia of the first hours had worn 
off, but his body was not reporting the position of the torso, 
head and four limbs he had formerly owned. He had, instead, a 
vague impression of being flattened and spread out over an 
enormous area. When he tried 
to move his fingers and toes, 
the response he got was so multiplied that he felt like a centipede. 

He had no sense of cramped 
muscles, such as would normally 
be expected after a long period of 
paralysis — and he was not 
breathing. Yet his brain was evidently being well supplied with 
food and oxygen; he felt clearheaded, at ease and healthy. 

He wasn't hungry, either, although he had been using energy 
steadily for a long time. There 
were, he thought, two possible 
reasons for that, depending on 
how you looked at it. One, that 
he wasn't hungry because he no 
longer had any stomach lining to 
contract ; two, that he wasn't 
hungry because the organism he 



was riding in had been well nourished by the superfluous tissues 
George had contributed. 

Two hours later, when the sun 
was setting, it began to rain. 
George saw the big, slow-falling 
drops and felt their dull impacts 
on his "skin." He didn't know 
whether rain would do him any 
damage or not, but crawled under a bush with large, fringed 
leaves just to be on the safe side. 
When the rain stopped, it was 
night and he decided he might 
as well stay where he was until 
morning. He did not feel tired, 
and it occurred to him to wonder 
whether he still needed to sleep. 
He composed himself as well as 
he could to wait for the answer. 

He was still wakeful after a 
long time had passed, but had 
made no progress toward deciding whether this answered the 
question or prevented it from 
being answered, when he saw a 
pair of dim lights coming slowly 
and erratically toward him. 

GEORGE watched them with 
an attentiveness compounded 
of professional interest and apprehension. Gradually, as they 
came closer, he made out that 
the lights were attached to long, 
thin stalks which grew from an 
ambiguous shape below — either 
light organs, like those of some 
deep-sea fish, or simply luminescent eyes.

George noted a feeling of tension in himself which seemed to 
suggest that adrenalin or an 
equivalent was being released 
somewhere in his system. He 
promised himself to follow this 
lead at the first possible moment; 
meanwhile, he had a more urgent 
problem to consider. Was this 
approaching organism the kind 
which the Something meisterii 
ate, or the kind which devoured 
the Something meisterii? If the 
latter, what could he do about it? 

For the present, at any rate, 
sitting where he was seemed to 
be indicated. The body he inhabited made use of camouflage 
in its normal, or untenanted 
state, and was not equipped for 
speed. So George held still and 
watched, keeping his eyes halfclosed, while he considered the 
possible nature of the approaching animal. 

The fact that it was nocturnal, 
he told himself, meant nothing. 
Moths were nocturnal; so were 
bats — no, the devil with bats, 
they were carnivores. 

The light-bearing creature 
came nearer, and George saw the 
faint gleam of a pair of long, 
narrow eyes below the two stalks. 

Then the creature opened its 
mouth. 

It had a great many teeth. 

George found himself crammed 
into some kind of crevice in a 
wall of rock, without any clear 



recollection of how he had got 
there. He remembered a flurry of 
branches as the creature sprang 
at him, and a moment's furious 
pain, and nothing but vague, starlit glimpses of leaves and soil. 

How had he got away? 

He puzzled over it until dawn 
came, and then, looking down 
at himself, he saw something 
that had not been there before. 
Under the smooth edge of gelatinous flesh, three or four projections of some kind were visible. 
It struck George that his sensation of contact with the stone 
underneath him had changed, 
too. He seemed to be standing 
on a number of tiny points instead of lying flat. 

He flexed one of the projections experimentally, then thrust 
it out straight ahead of him. It 
was a lumpy, single-jointed caricature of a finger or a leg. 

II 

T YING still for a long time, 
George Meister thought about 
it with as much coherence as he 
could muster. Then he waggled 
the limb again. It was there, and 
so were all the others, as solid 
and real as the rest of him. 

He moved forward experimentally, sending the same messages 
down to his finger-and-toe nerveends as before. His body lurched 
out of the cranny with a swift


12 




 



ness that very nearly tumbled 
him down over the edge of a 
minor precipice. 

Where he had crawled like a 
snail before, he now scuttled like 
an insect. 

But how? No doubt, in his 
terror when the thing with the 
teeth attacked, he had unconsciously tried to run as if he still 
had legs. Was that all there was 
to it? 

George thought of the carnivore 
again, and of the stalks supporting the organs which he had 
thought might be eyes. That 
would do as an experiment. He 
closed his eyes and imagined 
them rising outward, imagined 
the mobile stalks, growing, growing . . . He tried to convince 
himself that he had eyes like 
that, had always had them, that 
everyone who was anyone had 
eyes on stalks. 

Surely, something was happening. 

George opened his eyes again 
and found himself looking 
straight down at the ground, getting a view so close that it was 
blurred, out of focus. Impatiently, he tried to look up. All that 
happened was that his field of 
vision moved forward a matter 
of ten or twelve centimeters. 

It was at this point that a 
voice shattered the stillness. It 
sounded like someone trying to 
shout through half a meter of 



lard. "Urghh! Lluhh! Eeraghhf" 

George leaped convulsively, 
executed a neat turn and swept 
his eyes around a good two hundred and forty degrees of arc. He 
saw nothing but rocks and lichens. On a closer inspection, it appeared that a small green and 
orange larva or grub of some 
kind was moving past him. 
George regarded it with suspicion 
for a long moment, until the 
voice broke out again: 

"Ellfff! Elffneee!" 

The voice, somewhat higher 
this time, came from behind. 
George whirled again, swept his 
eyes around — 

Around an impossibly wide circuit. His eyes were on stalks, 
and they were mobile whereas a 
moment ago he had been staring 
at the ground, unable to look 
up. George's brain clattered into 
high gear. He had grown stalks 
for his eyes, all right, but they'd 
been limp, just extensions of the 
jellylike mass of his body, without a stiffening cell -structure or 
muscular tissue to move them. 
Then, when the voice had startled 
him, he'd got the stiffening and 
the muscles in a hurry. 

That must have been what had 
happened the previous night. 
Probably the process would have 
been completed, but much more 
slowly, if he hadn't been frightened. A protective mechanism, 
obviously. As for the voice — 



FOUR IN ONE 



13 



GEORGE rotated once more, 
slowly, looking all around 
him. There was no question about 
it: he was alone. The voice, which 
had seemed to come from someone or something standing just 
behind him, must in fact have 
issued from his own body. 

The voice started again, at a 
less frantic volume. It burbled 
a few times, then said quite clearly in a high tenor, "Whass happen'? Wheh am I?" 

George was floundering in 
enough bewilderment. He was in 
no condition to adapt quickly to 
more new circumstances, and 
when a large, dessicated lump fell 
from a nearby bush and bounced 
soundlessly to within a meter of 
him, he simply stared at it. 

He looked at the hard-shelled 
object and then at the laden bush 
from which it had dropped. Slowly, painfully, he worked his way 
through to a logical conclusion. 
The dried fruit had fallen without a sound. This was natural, 
because he had been totally deaf 
ever since his metamorphosis. 
But he had heard a voice! 

Ergo, hallucination or telepathy. 

The voice began again. "Help! 
Oh, dear, I wish someone would 
answer!" 

Vivian Bellis. Gumbs, even if he 
affected that tenor voice, wouldn't 
say, "Oh, dear." Neither would 
Miss McCarty. 



George's shaken nerves were 
returning to normal. He thought 
intently, / get scared, grow legs. . 
Bellis gets scared, grows a telepathic voice. That's reasonable, 
1 guess — her first and only impulse would be to yell. 

George tried to put himself into 
a yelling mood. He shut his eyes 
and imagined himself cooped up 
in a terrifyingly alien medium, 
without any control or knowledge 
of his predicament. He tried to 
shout: "Vivian!" 

He went on trying, while the 
girl's voice continued at intervals. 
Finally she stopped abruptly in 
the middle of a sentence. 

George said, "Can you hear 
me?" 

"Who's that? What do you 
want?" 

"This is George Meister, Vivian. Can you understand what 
I'm saying?" 

"What—" 

George kept at it. His pseudovoice, he judged, was a little garbled, just as Bellis's had been 
at first. At last the girl said, "Oh, 
George — I mean Mr. Meister! 
Oh, I've been so frightened. 
Where are you?" 

George explained , apparently 
not very tactfully, because Bellis 
shrieked when he was through 
and then went back to burbling. 

George sighed, and said, "Is 
there anyone else on the premises? Major Gumbs? Miss Mc


14 




 



Carty? Can you hear me?" 

A few minutes later two sets 
of weird sounds began almost simultaneously. When they became coherent, it was no trouble 
to identify the voices. 

Gumbs, the big, red-faced professional soldier, shouted, "Why 
the hell don't you watch where 
you're going, Meister? If you 
hadn't started that rock-slide, 
we wouldn't be in this mess!" 

Miss McCarty, who had a grim 
white face, a jutting jaw, and eyes 
the color of mud, said coldly, 
"Meister, all of this will be reported. AH of it." 

IT appeared that only Meister 
and Gumbs had kept the 
use of their eyes. All four of them 
had some muscular control, 
though Gumbs was the only one 
who had made any serious attempt to interfere with George's 
locomotion. Miss McCarty, not 
to George's surprise, had managed to retain a pair of functioning ears. 

But Bellis had been blind, deaf 
and dumb all through the afternoon and night. The only terminal sense-organs she had been 
able to use had been those of 
the skin — the perceptors of touch, 
heat and cold, and pain. She had 
heard nothing, seen nothing, but 
she had felt every leaf and stalk 
they had brushed against, the 
cold impact of every rain drop. 



and the pain of the toothy monster's bite. George's opinion of 
her went up several notches when 
he learned this. She had been 
terrified, but she hadn't been 
driven into hysteria or insanity. 

It further appeared that nobody was doing any breathing 
and nobody was aware of a 
heartbeat. 

George would have liked nothing better than to continue this 
discussion, but the other three 
were united in believing that 
what had happened to them after 
they got in was of less importance than how they were going 
to get out. 

"We can't get our," said 
George. "At least, I don't see any 
possibility of it in the present 
state of our knowledge. If we — " 

"But we've got to get out!" 
Vivian cried. 

"We'll go back to camp," said 
McCarty coldly. "Immediately. 
And you'll explain to the Loyalty 
Committee why you didn't return as soon as you regained consciousness." 

"That's right," Gumbs put in 
self-consciously. "If you can't do 
anything, Meister, maybe the 
other technical fellows can." 

George patiently explained his 
theory of their probable reception by the guards at the camp. 
McCarty's keen mind detected a 
flaw. "You grew legs, and stalks 
for your eyes, according to your 



FOUR IN ONE 



15 



own testimony. If you aren't lying, you can also grow a mouth. 
We'll announce ourselves as we 
approach." 

"That may not be easy," 
George told her. "We couldn't 
get along with just a mouth. We'd 
need teeth, tongue, hard and soft 
palates, lungs or the equivalent, 
vocal cords, and some kind of 
substitute for a diaphragm to 
power the whole business. I 'm 
wondering if it's possible at all, 
because when Miss Bellis finally 
succeeded in making herself 
heard, it was by the method we're 
using now. She didn't — " 

"You talk too much," McCarty interrupted. "Major Gumbs, 
Miss Bellis, you and I will try to 
form a speaking apparatus. The 
first to succeed will receive a 
credit mark on his record. Commence." 

GEORGE, being left out of the 
contest by implication, used 
his time trying to restore his 
hearing. It seemed to him likely 
that the Whatever-it-was meistetii had some sort of division of 
labor built into it, since Gumbs 
and he — -the first two to fall in — 
had kept their sight without making any special effort, while matters like hearing and touch had 
been left for the latecomers. This 
was fine in principle, and George 
approved of it, but he didn't like 
the idea of Miss McCarty's being 



the sole custodian of any part of 
the apparatus whatever. 

Even if he were able to persuade the other two to follow his 
lead — and at the moment this 
prospect seemed dim — McCarty 
was certain to be a holdout. And 
it might easily be vital to all of 
them, at some time in the near 
future, to have their hearing 
hooked into the circuit. 

He was distracted at first 
by muttered comments between 
Gumbs and Vivian — "Getting 
anywhere?" "I don't think so. 
Are you?" — interspersed between 
yawps, humming sounds and 
other irritating noises as they 
tried unsuccessfully to switch 
over from mental to vocal communication. Finally McCarty 
snapped, "Concentrate on forming the necessary organs instead 
of braying like jackasses." 

George settled down to work, 
using the same technique he had 
found effective before. With his 
eyes shut, he imagined that the 
thing with all the teeth was approaching in darkness — rap; 
slither; tap; click. He wished valiantly for ears to catch those 
faint approaching sounds. After 
a long time he thought he was 
beginning to succeed — or were 
those mental sounds, unconsciously emitted by one of the 
other three? Click. Slither. Swish. 
Scrape. 

George opened his eyes, gen


16 




 



uinely alarmed. A hundred meters away, facing him across the 
shallow slope of rocky ground, 
was a uniformed man just emerging from a stand of black vegetation spears. As George raised his 
eye-stalks, the man paused, 
stared back at him, then shouted 
and raised his rifle. 

George ran. Instantly there 
was a babble of voices inside him. 
and the muscles of his "legs" 
went into wild spasms. 

"Run, dammit!" he said frantically. "There's a trooper 
with — " 

The rifle went off with a 
deafening roar and George felt a 
sudden hideous pain aft of his 
spine. Vivian Bellis screamed. 
The struggle for possession of 
their common legs stopped and 
they scuttled full speed ahead 
for the cover of a nearby boulder. 

The rifle roared again. George 
heard rock splinters screeching 
through the foliage overhead. 
Then they were plunging down 
the side of a gully, up the other 
slope, over a low hummock and 
into a forest of tall, bare-limbed 
trees. 

George spotted a leaf-filled 
hollow and headed for it, fighting somebody else's desire to keep 
on running in a straight line. 
They plopped into the hollow 
and crouched there while three 
running men went past them. 



VIVIAN was moaning steadily. 
Raising his eye-stalks cautiously, George was able to see 
that several jagged splinters of 
stone had penetrated the monster's gelatinous flesh near the 
far rim. They had been very 
lucky. The shot had apparently 
been a near miss — accountable 
only on the grounds that the 
trooper had been shooting downhill at a moving target — and had 
shattered the boulder behind 
them. 

Looking more closely, George 
observed something which excited his professional interest. 
The whole surface of the monster 
appeared to be in constant slow 
ferment, tiny pits opening and 
closing as if the flesh were boiling . . . except that here the bubbles of air were not forcing their 
way outward, but were being engulfed at the surface and pressed 
down into the interior. 

He could also see, deep under 
the mottled surface of the huge 
lens-shaped body, four vague 
clots of darkness which must be 
the living brains of Gumbs, Bellis, McCarty — and Meister. 

Yes, there was one which was 
radially opposite his own eyestalks. It was an odd thing, 
George reflected, to be looking 
at your own brain. He hoped he 
could get used to it in time. 

,The four dark spots were arranged close together in an al


FOUR IN ONE 



17 




most perfect square at the center of the lens. The spinal cords, 
barely visible, crossed between 
them and rayed outward from 
the center. 

Pattern, George thought. The 
thing was designed to make use 
of more than one nervous system. 
It arranged them in an orderly 
fashion, with the brains inward 
for greater protection — and perhaps for another reason. Maybe 
there was even a provision for 
conscious cooperation among the 
passengers: a matrix that somehow promoted the growth of com


munication cells between the 
separate brains. If that were so, 
it would account for their ready 
success with telepathy. George 
wished acutely that he could 
get inside and find out. 

Vivian's pain was diminishing. 
Hers was the brain opposite 
George's and she had taken most 
of the effect of the rock splinters. But the fragments were 
sinking now, slowly, through the 
gelid substance of the monster's 
tissues. Watching carefully, 
George could see them move. 
When they got to the bottom.

they would be excreted, no doubt, 
just as the indigestible parts of 
their clothing and equipment had 

been. 

George wondered idly which 
of the remaining two brains 
was McCarty's and which was 
Gumb's. The answer proved easy 
to find. To George's left, as he 
looked back toward the center of 
the mound, was a pair of blue 
eyes set flush with the surface. 
They had lids apparently grown 
from the monster's substance, 
but thickened and opaque. 

To his right, George could 



make out two tiny openings, extending a few centimeters into the 
body, which could only be Miss 
McCarty's ears. George had an 
impulse to see if he could devise a method of dropping dirt 
into them. 

Anyhow, the question of returning to camp had been settled, at least for the moment. 
McCarty said nothing more 
about growing a set of speech 
organs, although George was sure 
she was determined to keep on 
trying. 

He didn't think she would suc

19 



ceed. Whatever the mechanism 
was by which these changes in 
bodily structure were accomplished, amateurs .like themselves 
probably could succeed only under the pressure of considerable 
emotional strain, and then just 
with comparatively simple tasks 
which involved one new structure at a time. And as he had already told McCarty, the speech 
organs in Man were extraordinarily diverse and complicated. 

IT occurred to George that 
speech might be achieved by 
creating a thin membrane to 
serve as a diaphragm, and an 
air chamber behind it, with a 
set of muscles to produce the 
necessary vibrations and modulate them. He kept the notion to 
himself, though, because he didn't 
want to go back. 

George was a rare bird: a scientist who was actually fitted for 
his work and loved it for its own 
sake. And right now he was sitting squarely in the middle of 
the most powerful research tool 
that had ever existed in his field: 
a protean organism, with the 
observer inside it, able to order 
its structure and watch the results; able to devise theories of 
function and test them on the 
tissues of what was effectively his 
own body — able to construct new 
organs, new adaptations to environment! 



George saw himself at the point 
of an enormous cone of new 
knowledge and some of the possibilities he glimpsed humbled 
and awed him. 

He couldn't go back, even if 
it were possible to do it without 
getting killed. If only he alone 
had fallen in — No, then the 
others would have pulled him 
out and killed the monster. 

There were, he felt, too many 
problems demanding solutions all 
at once. It was hard to concentrate: his mind kept slipping 
maddeningly out of focus. 

Vivian, whose pain had stopped 
some time ago, began to wail 
again. Gumbs snapped at her. 
McCarty cursed both of them. 
George himself felt that he had 
had very nearly all he could 
take, cooped up with three idiots 
who had no more sense than to 
squabble among themselves. 

"Wait a minute," he said. "Do 
you all feel the same way? Irritable? Jumpy? As if you'd been 
working for sixty hours straight 
and were too tired to sleep?" 

"Stop talking like a video ad," 
Vivian said angrily. "Haven't we 
got enough trouble without — *' 

"We're hungry," George interrupted. "We didn't realize it, because we haven't got the organs 
that usually signal hunger. But 
the last thing this body ate was 
us, and that was a whole day 
ago. We've got to find something 



20 




 



to ingest. And soon, I'd say." 

"Good Lord, you're right," 
said Gumbs. "But if this thing 
only eats people — I mean to 
say — " 

"It never met people until we 
landed," George replied curtly. 
"Any protein should do." < 

He started off in what he hoped 
was the direction they had been 
following all along — directly 
away from camp. At least, he 
thought, if they put enough distance behind them, they might 
get thoroughly lost. 

Ill 

rriHEY moved out of the trees 
and down the long slope of 
a valley, over a wiry carpet of 
dead grasses, until they reached 
a watercourse in which a thin 
trickle was still flowing. Far 
down the bank, partly screened 
by clumps of skeletal shrubbery, 
George saw a group of animals 
that looked vaguely like miniature pigs. He told the others about 
it, and started cautiously in that 
direction. 

"Which way is the wind blowing, Vivian?" he asked. "Can you 
feel it?" 

She said, "No. I could before, 
when we were going downhill, 
but now I think we're facing into 
it." 

"Good. We may be able to 
sneak up on them." 



"But we're not going to eat 
animals, are we?" 

"Yes, how about it, Meister?" 
Gumbs put in. "I don't say I'm 
a squeamish fellow, but after 
all—" 

George, who felt a little 
squeamish himself — like all the 
others, he had been brought up 
on a diet of yeasts and synthetic 
protein — said testily, "What else 
can we do? You've got eyes; you 
can see that it's autumn here. 
Autumn after a hot summer, at 
that. Trees bare, streams dried 
up. We eat meat or go without — 
or would you rather hunt for 
insects?" 

Gumbs, shocked to the core, 
muttered for a while and then 
gave up. 

Seen at closer range, the animals looked less porcine and even 
more unappetizing than before. 
They had lean, segmented, pinkish-gray bodies, four short legs, 
flaring ears, and blunt scimitarlike snouts with which they were 
rooting in the ground, occasionally turning up something which 
they gulped, ears flapping. 

George counted thirty of them, 
grouped fairly closely in a little 
space of clear ground between 
the bushes and the river. They 
moved slowly, but their short 
legs looked powerful; he guessed 
that they could run fast- enough 
when they had to. 

He inched forward, keeping his 



FOUR IN ONE 



21 



eye-stalks low, stopping instantly 
whenever one of the beasts looked up. Moving with increasing 
caution, he had approached to 
within ten meters of the nearest 
when McCarty said abruptly: 

"Meister, has it occurred to 
you to wonder just how we are 
going to eat these animals?" 

"Don't be foolish," he said irritably. "We'll just — " He stopped, baffled. 

TA1D the thing's normal method 
of assimiliation stop as soon 
as it got a tenant? Were they 
supposed to grow fangs and a 
gullet and all the rest of the 
apparatus? Impossible; they'd 
starve to death first. But on the 
other hand — damn this fuzzyheaded feeling — wouldn't it have 
to stop, to prevent the tenant 
from being digested with his first 
meal? 

"Well?" McCarty demanded. 

That guess was wrong, George 
knew, but he couldn't say why; 
and it was a distinctly unpleasant , thought. Or, even worse, 
suppose the meal became the 
tenant, and the tenant the meal? 

The nearest animal's head 
went up, and four tiny red eyes 
stared directly at George. The 
floppy ears snapped to attention. 
It was no time for speculation. 

"He's seen us!" George shouted mentally. "Run!" 

One instant they were lying 



still in the prickly dry grass ; 
the next they were skimming 
across the ground, with the herd 
galloping away straight ahead of 
them. The hams of the nearest 
beast loomed up closer and closer, bounding furiously; then they 
had run it down and vaulted 
over it. 

Casting an eye backward, 
George saw that it was lying 
motionless in the grass — unconscious or dead. 

They ran down another one. 
The anesthetic, George thought 
lucidly. One touch does it. And 
another, and another. Of course 
we can digest them, he thought, 
with relief. It has to be selective 
to begin with or it couldn't have 
separated out our nervous tissue. 

Four down. Six down. Three 
more together as the herd bunched between the last arm of the 
thicket and the steep river-bank; 
then two that tried to double 
back ; then four stragglers, one 
after the other. 

The rest of the herd disappeared into the tall grass up the 
slope, but fifteen bodies were 
strewn behind them. 

^T^AKING ho chances, George 
went back to the beginning 
of the line and edged the monster's body under the first carcass. 

"Crouch down, Gumbs," he 
said. "We have to slide under it 



22 




 



. . . that's far enough. Leave the 
head hanging over." 

"What for?" barked the soldier. 

"You don't want his brain in 
here with us, do you? We don't 
know how many this thing is 
equipped to take. It might even 
like this one better than any of 
ours. But I can't see it bothering 
to keep the rest of the nervous 
system, if we make sure not to 
eat the head." 

"Oh!" said Vivian. 

"I beg your pardon. Miss Bellis," George said contritely. "It 
shouldn't be too unpleasant, 
though, if we don't let it bother 
us. It isn't as if we had taste buds 
or — " 

"It's all right," she said. "Just 
please let's not talk about it." 

*'I should think not," Gumbs 
put in. "A little more tact, don't 
you think, Meister?" 

Accepting this reproof, George 
turned his attention to the corpse 
that lay on the monster's glabrous surface, between his section and Gumbs's. It was sinking, 
just visibly, into the flesh. A 
cloud of opacity was spreading 
around it. 

When it was almost gone and 
the neck had been severed, they 
moved on to the next. This time," 
at George's suggestion, they took 
aboard two at once. Gradually 
their irritable mood faded; they 
began to feel at ease and cheerful. 



and George found it possible to 
think consecutively without having vital points slip out of his 
reach. 

They were on their eighth and 
ninth courses, and George was 
happily engaged in an intricate 
chain of speculation as to the 
monster's circulatory system, 
when Miss McCarty broke a long 
silence to announce: 

"I have now perfected a method by which we can return to 
camp safely. We will begin at 
once." 

OTARTLED and dismayed, 
k ~' George turned his eyes toward 
McCarty's quadrant of the monster. Protruding from the rim 
was a stringy, jointed something 
that looked like — yes, it was! — 
a grotesque but recognizable arm 
and hand. As he watched, the 
lumpy fingers fumbled with a 
blade of grass, tugged, uprooted 
it. 

"Major Gumbs!" said McCarty. "It will be your task to locate 
the following articles as quickly 
as possible. One, a surface suitable for writing. I suggest a large 
leaf, light in color, dry but not 
brittle, or a tree from which a 
large section of bark can be easily 
peeled. Two, a pigment. No 
doubt you will be able to discover berries yielding suitable 
juice. If not, mud will do. Three, 
a twig or reed for use as a pen.

When you have directed me to 
all these essential items. I will 
employ them to write a message 
outlining our predicament. You 
will read the result and point out 
any errors, which I will then correct. When the message is completed, we will return with it to 
the camp, approaching at night, 
and deposit it in a conspicuous 
place. We will retire until daybreak, and when the message has 
been read, we will approach 
again. Begin, Major." 

"Well, yes," said Gumbs, "that 
ought to work, except — I suppose 
you've figured out some system 
for holding the pen, Miss McCarty?" 

"Fool !" she replied. "I have 
made a hand, of course." 

"Well, in that case, by all 
means. Let's see, I believe we 
might try this thicket first — " 
Their common body gave a lurch 
in that direction. 

George held back. "Wait a 
minute," he said desperately. 
"Let's at least have the common 
sense to finish this meal before 
we go. There's no telling when 
we'll get another." 

McCarty demanded, "How 
large are these creatures. Major?" 

"About sixty centimeters long, 
I should say." 

"And we have consumed nine 
of them, is that correct?" 

"Nearer eight," George cor


rected. "These two are only half 
gone." 

"In other words," McCarty 
said, "we have had two apiece. 
That should be ample. Don't you 
agree, Major?" 

George said i earnestly, "Miss 
McCarty, you're thinking in 
terms of human food requirements, whereas this organism has 
a different metabolic rate and at 
least three times the mass of four 
human beings. Look at it this 
way — the four of us together had 
a mass of about three hundred 
kilos, and yet twenty hours after 
this thing absorbed us, it was 
hungry again. Well, these animals wouldn't weigh much more 
than twenty kilos apiece at one G 
— and according to your scheme, 
we've got to hold out until after 
daybreak tomorrow." 

' 'Something in that," Gumbs 
agreed. "Yes, on the whole. Miss 
McCarty, I think we had better 
forage while we can. It won't take 
us more than half an hour longer, 
at this rate." 

"Very well. Be as quick as you 
can, though." 

rpHEY moved on to the next 
pair of victims. George's 
brain was working furiously. It 
was no good arguing with McCarty. If he could only convince 
Gumbs, then Bellis would fall 
in with the majority — maybe. It 
was the only hope he had. 



24 




 



"Gumbs," he said, "have you 
given any thought to what's going to happen to us when we get 
back?" 

"Not my line, you know. I 
leave that to the technical fellows like yourself." 

"No, that isn't what I mean. 
Suppose you were the C. O. of 
this team, and four other people 
had fallen into this organism instead of us — " 

"What? What? I don't follow." 

George patiently repeated it. 

"Yes, I see what you mean. 
So?" 

"What orders would you give?" 

Gumbs thought a moment. 
"Turn the thing over to the bio 
section, I suppose." 

"You don't think you might 
specimen and so on. Handle with 
order it destroyed as a possible 
menace?" 

"Good Lord, I suppose I might. 
No, but you see, we'll be careful 
what we say in the note. We'll 
point out that we're a valuable 
care." 

"All right," George said, "suppose that works, then what? Since 
it's out of your line, I'll tell you. 
Nine chances out of ten, bio section will classify us as a possible 
biological enemy weapon. That 
means, first of all, that we'll go 
through a full-dress interrogation and I don't have to tell you 
what that can be like — " 

"Major Gumbs," said McCar


ty stridently, "Mei^ter will be 
executed for disloyalty at the 
first opportunity. You are forbidden to talk to him, under the 
same penalty." 

"But she can't stop you' from 
listening to me," George said 
tensely. "In the second place, 
Gumbs, they'll take samples. 
Without anesthesia. Finally, 
they'll either destroy us just the 
same, or they'll send us back to 
the nearest strong point for more 
study. We will then be Federation property, Gumbs, in a topsecret category, and since nobody 
in Intelligence will ever dare to 
take the responsibility of clearing 
us, we'll sray there. 

"Gumbs, this is a valuable 
specimen, but it will never do 
anybody any good if we go back 
to camp. Whatever we discover 
about it, even if it's knowledge 
that could save billions of lives, 
that will be top-secret, too, and 
it'll never get past the walls of 
Intelligence. ... If you're still 
hoping that they can get you 
out of this, you're wrong. This 
isn't like limb grafts. Four whole 
body has been destroyed, Gumbs, 
everything but your nervous system and your eyes. The only new 
body we'll get is the one we make 
ourselves. We've got to stay here 
and — and work this out ourselves." 

"Major Gumbs," said McCarty, "I think we have wasted quite 



FOUR IN ONE 



25 



enough time. Begin your search 
for the materials I need." 

WT^OR a moment. Gumbs was 
silent and their collective body 
did not move. 

Then he said: "Miss McCarty 
— unofficially, of course — there's 
one point I'd like your opinion 
on. Before we begin. That is to 
say, they'll be able to patch together some sort of bodies for 
us, don't you think? I mean one 
technical fellow says one thing, 
another says the opposite. Do 
you see what I'm driving at?" 

George had been watching McCarty's new limb uneasily. It was 
flexing rhythmically and, he was 
almost certain, gradually growing larger. The fingers groped in 
the dry grass, plucking first a 
single blade, then two together, 
finally a whole tuft. Now she 
said : "I have no opinion, Major. 
The question is irrelevant. Our 
duty is to return to camp. That 
is all we need to know." 

"Oh, I quite agree with you 
there," said Gumbs. "And besides, "he added, "there really 
isn't any alternative, is there?" 

George, staring down at one 
of the fingerlike projections visible below the rim of the monster, 
was passionately willing it to 
turn into an arm. He had, he 
suspected, started much too late. 

"The alternative," he said, "is 
simply to keep on going as we 



are. Even if the Federation holds 
this planet for a century, there'll 
be places on it that will never be 
explored. We'll be safe." 

"I mean to say," Gumbs went 
on as if he had only paused for 
thought, "a fellow can't very well 
cut himself off from civilization, 
can he?" There was a thoughtful 
tone to his voice. 

Again George felt a movement 
toward the thicket; again he resisted it. Then he found himself 
overpowered as another set of 
muscles joined themselves to 
Gumbs's. Quivering, crabwise, 
the Something-or-other meisterii 
moved half a meter. Then it 
stopped, straining. 

"I believe you, Mr. Meister — 
George," Vivian Bellis said. "I 
don't want to go back. Tell me 
what you want me to do." 

"You're doing beautifully right 
now," George assured her after 
a speechless instant. "Except if 
you can grow an arm, I imagine 
that will be useful." 

"Now we know where we 
stand," said McCarty to Gumbs. 

"Yes. Quite right." 

"Major Gumbs," she said 
crisply, "you are opposite me, I 
believe?" 

"Am I?" asked Gumbs doubtfully. 

"Never mind. I believe you are. 
Now is Meister to your right or 
left?" 

"Left. I know that, anyhow. 



26 




 



Can see his eye-stalks out of the 
corner of my eye." 

"Very well." McCarty's arm 
rose, with a sharp-pointed fragment of rock clutched in the 
blobby fingers. 

HORRIFIED, George watched 
it bend backward across the 
curve of the monster's body. The 
long, knife-sharp point probed 
tentatively at the surface three 
centimeters short of the area over 
his brain. Then the fist made an 
abrupt up-and-down movement 
and a fierce stab of pain shot 
through him. 

"Not quite long enough, I 
think," McCarty said. She flexed 
the arm, then brought it back. 
"Major Gumbs, after my next 
attempt, you will tell me if you 
notice any reaction in Meister's 
eye-stalks." 

The pain was still throbbing 
along George's nerves. With one 
half-blinded eye, he watched the 
embryonic arm that was growing, too slowly, under the rim; 
with the other, fascinated, he 
watched McCarty's arm lengthen 
slowly toward him. 

It was growing visibly, he suddenly realized, but it wasn't getting any nearer. In fact, incredibly 
enough, it seemed to be losing 
ground. 

The monster's flesh was flowing away under it, expanding in 
both directions. 



McCarty stabbed again, with 
vicious strength. This time the 
pain was less acute. 

"Major?" she asked. "Any result?" 

"No," said Gumbs, "no, I think 
not. We seem to be moving forward a bit, though. Miss McCarty." 

"A ridiculous error," she replied. "We are being forced back. 
Pay attention, Major." 

"No, really," he protested. 
"That is to say, we're moving 
toward the thicket. Forward to 
me, backward to you." 

"Major Gumbs, / am moving 
forward, you are moving back." 

They were both right, George 
discovered. The monster's body 
was no longer circular ; it was 
extending itself along the axis. A 
suggestion of concavity was becoming visible in the center. Below the surface, too, there was 
motion. 

The four brains now formed 
an oblong, not a square. 

The positions of the spinal 
cords had shifted. His own and 
Vivian's seemed to be about 
where they were, But Gumbs's 
now passed under McCarty's 
brain, and vice versa. 

Having increased its mass by 
some two hundred kilos, the 
Something -or- other meisterii was 
fissioning into two individuals — 
and tidily separating its tenants, 
two to each. Gumbs and Meister 



FOUR IN ONE 



in one, McCarty and Bellis in 
the other. 

NEXT time it happened, he 
realized, each product of the 
fission would be reduced to one 
brain — and the time after that, 
one of the new individuals out 
of each pair would be a monster 
in the primary state, quiescent, 
camouflaged, waiting to be stumbled over. 

But that meant that, like the 
common ameba. this fascinating 
organism was immortal, barring 
accidents. It simply grew and 
divided. 

Not the tenants, though, unfortunately. Their tissues would 
wear out and die. 

Or would they? Human nervous tissue didn't regenerate, but 
neither did it proliferate as 
George's and Miss McCarty's had 
done ; neither did any human 
tissue build new cells fast enough 
to account for George's eyestalks or Miss McCarty's arm. 

There was no question about 
it: none of that new tissue could 
possibly be human ; it was all 
counterfeit, produced by the 
monster from its own substance 
according to the structural "blueprints" in the nearest genuine 
cells. And it was a perfect counterfeit : the new tissues knit with 
the old, axones coupled with 
dendrites, muscles contracted or 
expanded on command. 



And therefore, when nerve cells 
wore out, they could be replaced. 
Eventually the last human cell 
would go, the human tenant 
would have become totally monster — but "a difference that makes 
no difference is no difference." 
Effectively, the tenant would still 
be human and he would be immortal. 

Barring accidents. 

Or murder. 

Miss McCarty was saying. 
"Major Gumbs, you are being 
ridiculous. The explanation is 
quite obvious. Unless you are deliberately deceiving me. for what 
reason I cannot imagine, then 
our efforts to move in opposing 
directions must be pulling this 
creature apart." 

McCarty was evidently confused in her geometry. Let her 
stay that way — it would keep her 
off balance until the fission was 
complete. No, that was no good. 
George himself was out of her 
reach already and getting farther 
away, but how about Bellis? Her 
brain and McCarty's were, if 
anything, closer together . . . 

WHAT was he to do? If he 
warned the girl, that would 
only draw McCarty's attention 
to her sooner. 

There wasn't much time left, 
he realized abruptly. If some 
physical linkage between the 
brains actually had occurred to 



28 




 



make communication possible, 
those cells couldn't hold out 
much longer; the gap between 
the two pairs of brains was widening steadily. He had to keep 
McCarty from discovering how 
the four of them would be paired. 

"Vivian!" he said. 

"Yes, George?" 

"Listen, we're not pulling this 
body apart. It's splitting. That's 
the way it reproduces. You and 
I will be in one half, Gumbs and 
McCarty in the other," he lied 
convincingly. "If they don't give 
us any trouble, we can all go 
where we please." 

"Oh, I'm so glad!" What a 
warm voice she had . . . 

"Yes." said George nervously, 
"but we may have to fight them; 
it's up to them. So grow an arm, 
Vivian." 

"I'll try," she said uncertainly. 

McCarty's voice cut across 
hers. "Major Gumbs, since you 
have eyes, it will be your task to 
see to it that those two do not 
escape. Meanwhile. I suggest that 
you also grow an arm." 

"Doing my best," said Gumbs. 

Puzzled, George glanced downward, past his own half-formed 
arm. There, almost out of sight, 
a fleshy bulge appeared under 
Gumbs's section of the rim! The 
Major had been working on it in 
secret, keeping it hidden . . . and 
it was already better-developed 
than George's. 



"Oh-oh," said Gumbs abruptly. "Look here, Miss McCarty, 
Meister's been leading you up 
the garden path. Deceiving you, 
you understand. Clever, I must 
say. I mean you and I aren't 
going to be in the same half. 
How could we be? We're on opposite sides of the blasted thing. 
It's going to be you and Miss 
Bellis, me and Meister." 

The monster was developing 
a definite waistline. The spinal 
cords had rotated now, so that 
there was clear space between 
them in the center. 

"Yes," said McCarty faintly. 
"Thank you. Major Gumbs." 

"George!" came Vivian's frightened voice, distant and weak. 
"What shall I do?" 

"Grow an arm!" he shouted. . 

There was no reply. 

IV 

FROZEN, George watched McCarty's arm, the rock-fragment still clutched at the end of 
it, rise into view and swing leftward at full stretch over the bubbling surface of the monster. He 
had time to see it bob up and 
viciously down again; time to 
think. Still short, thank God — 
that's McCarty's right arm, it's 
farther from Vivian's brain than 
it was from mine; time, finally, 
to realize that he could not possibly help Vivian before McCarty 



30 




 



lengthened the arm the few centimeters more that were necessary. The fission was only half 
complete, yet he could no more 
move to where he wanted to be 
than a Siamese twin could walk 
around his brother. 

Then his time was up. A flicker 
of motion warned him, and he 
looked back to see a lumpy, distorted pseudo-hand clutching for 
his eye-stalks. 

Instinctively he brought his 
own up, grasped the other's wrist 
and hung on desperately. It was 
half again the size of his, and so 
strongly muscled that although his 
leverage was better, he couldn't 
force it back or hold it away. 
He could only keep the system 
oscillating up and down, adding 
his strength to Gumbs's so that 
the mark was # overshot. 

Gumbs began to vary the force 
and rhythm of his movements, 
trying to catch him off guard. 
A thick finger brushed the base 
of one eye-stalk. 

"Sorry about this, Meister," 
said Gumbs. "No hard feelings, 
you understand. Between us 
(oof) I don't fancy that McCarty woman much — but (ugh! 
almost had you that time) way 
I see it, I've got to look after 
myself. Mean to say (ugh) if I 
don't, who will? See what I 
mean?" 

George did not reply. Astonishingly enough, he was no longer 



afraid, either for himself or for 
Vivian; he was simply overpoweringly, ecstatically, monomaniacally angry. Power from somewhere was surging into his 
arm. Fiercely concentrating, he 
thought Bigger! Stronger! Longer! More arm! 

The arm grew. Visibly, it added substance to itself, it lengthened, thickened, bulked with 
muscle. So did Gumbs's, however. 

He began another arm. So did 
Gumbs. 

All around him the surface of 
the monster was bubbling violently. 'And, George realized, the 
lenticular bulk of it was perceptibly shrinking. Its curious breathing system was inadequate; the 
thing was cannibalizing itself, 
destroying its own tissues to make 
up the difference. 

How small could it get and 
still support two human tenants? 

And which brain would it dispense with first? 

He had no leisure to think 
about it. Scrabbling in the grass 
with his second hand, Gumbs 
had failed to find anything that 
would serve as a weapon. Now, 
with a sudden lurch, he swung 
their entire body around. 

The fission was complete. 

That thought reminded George 
of Vivian and McCarty. He 
risked a split-second's glance behind him, saw nothing but a 



FOUR IN ONE 



31 



featureless ovoid mound, and 
looked back in time to see 
Gumbs's half-grown right fist 
pluck up a long, sharp-pointed 
dead branch and drive it murderously at his eyes. 

THE lip of the river-bank was 
a meter away to the left. 
George made it in one abrupt 
surge. Their common body slipped, tottered, hesitated, hands 
clutching wildly — and toppled, 
end over end, hurtling in a cloud 
of dust and pebbles down the 
breakneck slope to a meaty 
smash at the bottom. 

The universe made one more 
giant turn around them and came 
to rest. Half-blinded, George 
groped for the hold he had lost, 
found the wrist and seized it. 

"Oh, Lord!" said Gumbs. "I'm 
hurt, Meister. Go on, man, finish 
it, will you? Don't waste time." 

George stared at him suspiciously, without relaxing his grip. 
"What's the matter with you?" 
"Paralyzed. I can't move." 
They had fallen onto a small 
boulder, George saw, one of 
many with which the river-bed 
was strewn. This one was roughly 
conical; they were draped over it, 
and the blunt point was directly 
under Gumbs's spinal cord, a few 
centimeters from the brain. 

"Gumbs, that may not be as 
bad as you think. If I can show 
you it isn't, will you give up and 



put yourself under my orders?" 

"How do you mean? My 
spine's crushed." 

"Never mind that now. Will 
you or won't you?" 

"Why, yes," agreed Gumbs. 
"That's very decent of you, Meister, matter of fact. You have my 
word, for what it's worth." 

"All right," said George. Straining hard, he managed to get their 
body off the boulder. Then he 
stared up at the slope down which 
they had tumbled. Too steep; 
he'd have to find an easier way 
back. He turned and started off 
to eastward, paralleling the thin 
stream that flowed in the center 
of the watercourse. 

"What's up now?" Gumbs 
asked after a moment. 

"We've got to find a way up 
to the top," George said impatiently. "I may still be able to 
help Vivian." 

"Ah, yes. Afraid I was thinking about myself, Meister. If you 
don't mind telling me, what's the 
damage?" 

SHE couldn't still be alive, 
George was thinking despondently, but if there were any 
small chance — 

"You'll be all right," he said. 
"If you were still in your old 
body, that would be a fatal injury, or permanently disabling, 
anyhow, but not in this thing. 
You can repair yourself as easily 



32 




 



as you can grow a new limb." 

"Stupid of me not to think of 
that," said Gumbs. "But does 
that mean we were simply wasting our time trying to kill one 
another?" 

"No. If you'd crushed my 
brain, I think the organism 
would have digested it and that 
would be the end of me. But 
short of anything" that drastic, I 
believe we're immortal." 

"Immortal? That does rather 
put another face on it, doesn't 
it?" 

The bank was becoming a little 
lower, and at one point, where 
the raw ground was thickly seeded with boulders, there was a 
talus slope that looked as if it 
could be climbed. George started 
up it. 

"Meister," said Gumbs after a 
moment. 

"What do you want?" 

"You're right, you know — I'm 
getting some feeling back already. Look here, is there anything this beast can't do? I mean, 
for instance, do you suppose we 
could put ourselves back together 
the way we were, with all the — 
appendages, and so on?" 

"It's possible," George said 
curtly. It was a thought that had 
been in the back of his mind, but 
he didn't feel like discussing it 
with Gumbs just now. 

They were halfway up the 
slope. 



"Well, in that case," said 
Gumbs meditatively, "the thing 
has military possibilities, you 
know. Man who brought a thing 
like that direct to the War Department could write his own 
ticket, more or less." 

"After we split up," George 
offered, "you can do whatever 
you please." 

"But dammit," said Gumbs in 
an irritated tone, "that won't do." 

"Why not?" 

"Because," said Gumbs, "they 
might find you." His hands 
reached up abruptly, pried out a 
small boulder before George could 
stop him. 

The large boulder above it 
trembled, dipped and leaned ponderously outward. George, directly underneath, found that he 
could move neither forward nor 
back. 

"Sorry again," he heard Gumbs 
saying, with what sounded like 
genuine regret. "But you know 
the Loyalty Committee. I simply 
can't take the chance." 

THE boulder seemed to take 
forever to fall. George tried 
twice more, with all his strength, 
to move out of its path. Then, 
instinctively, he put his arms up 
straight under it. 
It struck. 

George felt his arms breaking 
like twigs, and saw a looming 
grayness that blotted out the sky; 



FOUR IN ONE 



33 



he felt a sledge impact that made 
the ground shudder beneath him. 

He heard a splattering sound. 

And he was still alive. That 
astonishing fact kept him fully 
occupied for a long time after the 
boulder had clattered its way 
down the slope into silence. Then, 
at last, he looked down to his 
right. 

The resistance of his stiffened 
arms, even while they broke, had 
been enough to lever the falling 
boulder over, a distance of some 
thirty centimeters. The right half 
of the monster was a flattened, 
shattered ruin. He could see a 
few flecks of pasty gray matter, 
melting now into green -brown 
translucence as the mass flowed 
slowly together again. 

In twenty minutes, the last 
remnants of a superfluous spinal 
cord had been absorbed, the 
monster had collected itself back 
into its normal lens shape, and 
George's pain was diminishing. 
In five minutes more, his mended 
arms were strong enough to use. 

They were also more convincingly shaped and colored than 
before — the tendons, the fingernails, even the wrinkles of the 
skin were in good order. In ordinary circumstances this discovery would have left George 
happily bemused for hours. Now, 
in his impatience, he barely noticed it. He climbed to the top 
of the bank. 



Thirty meters away, a humped 
green -brown body like his own 
lay motionless on the dry grass. 

It contained, of course, only 
one brain. Whose? 

McCarty's, almost certainly; 
Vivian hadn't had a chance. But 
then how did it happen that there 
was no visible trace of McCarty's 
arm? 

Unnerved, George walked around the creature for a closer 
inspection. 

ON the far side, he encountered 
two dark-brown eyes, with 
an oddly unfinished appearance. 
They focused on him after an instant and the whole body quivered slightly, moving toward him. 

Vivian's eyes had been brown; 
George remembered them distinctly. Brown eyes with heavy 
dark lashes in a tapering slender 
face. But did that prove anything? What color had McCarty's eyes been? He couldn't remember. 

George moved closer, hoping 
fervently that the Something-orother meisterii was at least 
advanced enough to conjugate, 
instead of trying to devour members of its own species . . . 

The two bodies touched, clung 
and began to flow together. 
Watching, George saw the fissioning process reverse itself. From 
paired lenses, the alien flesh 
melted into a slipper-shape, to an 



34 




 



ovoid, to a lens-shape again. His 
brain and the other drifted closer 
together, the spinal cords crossing 
at right angles. 

And it was only then that he 
noticed an oddity -about the other 
brain. It seemed to be more solid 
and compact than his, the outline 
sharper. 

"ViviariV* he said worriedly. 
"Is that you?" 

No answer. He tried again; 
and again. 

Finally: 

"George! Oh dear — I want to 
cry, but I don't seem able to do 
it." 

"No lachrymal glands," George 
said automatically. "Uh, Vivian?" 

"Yes, George?" That warm 
voice again . . . 

"What happened to Miss McCarty? How did you — " 

"I don't know. She's gone, 
isn't she? I haven't heard her for 
a long time." 

"Yes," said George, "she's 
gone. You mean you don't know? 
Tell me what you did." 

"Well, I wanted to make an 
arm, because you told me to, but 
I didn't think I had time enough. 
So I made a skull instead. And 
those things to cover my spine — " 

"Vertebrae." Now why, he 
thought discontentedly, didn't I 
think of that? "And then?" 

"I think I'm crying now," she 
said. "Yes, I am. It's such a relief 



— And then, after that, nothing. 
She was still hurting me, and I 
just lay still and thought how 
wonderful it would be if she 
weren't in here with me. After a 
while, she wasn't. And then I 
grew eyes to look for you." 

The explanation, it seemed to 
George, was more perplexing than 
the enigma. Staring around in a 
vague search for enlightenment, 
he caught sight of something he 
hadn't noticed before. Two meters to his left, just visible in 
the grass, was a damp-looking 
grayish lump, with a suggestion 
of a stringy extension trailing off 
from it. 

There must, he decided suddenly, be some mechanism in 
the Something-or-other meisterii 
for disposing of tenants who 
failed to adapt themselves — 
brains that went into catatonia, 
or hysteria, or suicidal frenzy. 
An eviction clause in the lease. 

Somehow, Vivian had managed 
to stimulate that mechanism — to 
convince the organism that McCarty's brain was not only superfluous but dangerous — "Toxic" 
was the word. 

It was the ultimate ignominy. 
Miss McCarty had not been digested. She'd been excreted. 

T>Y sunset, twelve hours later, 
they had made a good deal of 
progress. They had reached ' an 
understanding very agreeable to

35 



them both. They had hunted 
down another herd of the pseudopigs for their noon meal. They 
had not once quarreled or even 
irritated each other. And for divergent reasons — on George's side 
because the monster's normal 
metabolism was unsatisfactory 
when it had to move quickly, 
and on Vivian's because she refused to believe that any man 
could be attracted to her in her 
present condition — they had begun a serious attempt to reshape 
themselves. 

The first trials were extraordinarily difficult, the rest surprisingly easy. Again and again, they 
had to let themselves collapse 
back into an ameboid shape, victims of some omitted or malfunctioning organ, but each failure smoothed the road. They 
were at last able to stand breathless but breathing, swaying but 
stable, face to face — two preliminary sketches of self-made 
Man. 

They had also put thirty kilometers between themselves and 
the Federation camp. Standing on 
the crest of a rise and looking 
southward across the shallow 
valley, George could see a faint 
funereal glow : the mining machines, chewing out metals to 



feed the fabricators that would 
spawn lethal spaceships. 

"We'll never go back there, 
will we?" begged Vivian. 

"No," said George confidently. 
"We'll let them find us. When 
they do, they'll be a lot more 
disconcerted than we will. We can 
make ourselves anything we want 
to be, remember." 

"I want you to want me, so 
I'm going to be beautiful." 

"More beautiful than any woman ever was," he agreed, "and 
both of us will have super-intelligence. I don't see why not. We 
can direct our growth in any way 
we choose. We'll be more than 
human." 

"I'd like that," said Vivian. 

"They won't. The McCartys 
and the Gumbs and all the rest 
would never have a chance 
against us. We're the future." 

There was one thing more, a 
small matter, but important to 
George, because it marked his 
sense of accomplishment, of one 
phase ended and a new one begun. He had finally completed 
the name of his discovery. 

It wasn't Something-or-other 
meisterii at all. 

It was Spes hominis — Man's 
hope.

THE strip of indestructible

passes between rollers, dips into 
chemical baths, is stamped, dyed, 
analyzed for flaws, and then run 
through a unit which is detached 
from the main body of the machine every night and locked in 



a guarded vault. Finally, the strip 
emerges, is chopped into convenient lengths, and delivered into a 
bin, from which it is carefully 
moved into armored cars and distributed. It is known as money. 

Besides being non-defaceable, 
fireproof, immune to wear,

had an electronic pattern impressed into the fiber by that topsecret unit. When you spend it, 
it is passed over a simple plate 
that reads the pattern. If serial 
number and pattern match, nothing happens. But if what you're 
presenting as legal tender is 
homemade, so many bells go off 
you'd think you were in a penny 
arcade. The engraving, the chemical composition of the ink, and 
the fiber are difficult enough to 
duplicate, but the pattern snaps 
the clincher on it. Only the government's got the equipment to 
put that in. 

All of which may serve to explain why Saxegaard yelped 
when I spread the fourteen identical bills on his desk. 

T>ESIDES being the Chief Inspector, United Galactic Federations Department of the 
Treasury, Investigation Division, 
(Currency), Saxegaard is a short 
man with a big mouth. The kind 
of fellow who always waits ninety 
seconds between cigarettes so he 
won't be accused of chain smoking. 

"Baumholtzer, where'd you get 

these?" he asked after he climbed 
down off the drapes. 

They'd come into the New 
York Clearing House from a 
branch on Deneb XI. The manager there had blown his top and 
called us the minute he spotted 



them. I told Saxegaard that, and 
he chewed at his thumb for a 
few minutes. 

"Will he spread the word 
around?" he asked finally. 

"I threw the fear of UnGalac 
into him." 

"Good. At least we won't have 
any financial panics — for a while. 
Not'until that manager gets himself out from financially under, 
anyway. You checked these 
through the lab?" he hopefully 
asked, probably hoping for a 
loophole. 

"The ink and paper's government stock, all right, and they 
match government plates. Beeper 
plates don't even hum when 
they're passed over them. In fact, 
you could spend them anywhere, 
as long as you only passed one 
bill at a time." 

"Probably wouldn't even have 
to be that careful. How do you 
know all the bills in your wallet 
right now don't have the same 
serial number?" Saxegaard 
asked. 

I shook my head. "I checked." 

Saxegaard looked at the bills 
a while longer, then sank back 
into his chair. His mouth twisted 
into a sad little smile. 

"Baumholtzer," he said, "you 
know how much work this office 
has done up to now. It's a joke, 
a sinecure. Nobody, nobody can 
logically expect to counterfeit a 
bill and get away with it. It's 



38 




 



only because, throughout the Universe, there is a certain percentage of people who will try 
anything once, and a corresponding percentage of purblind idiots 
who will accept anything with 
engraving on it as currency of 
the realm, that this department 
exists at all. I have seen cigar 
coupons and crayon sketches 
come into this office. I have seen 
grocery store premium certificates and jet bus transfers, but 
only because those same microcephalic imbeciles have neglected 
to pass the stuff over a beeper 
plate. 

"Do you think I've been happy 
in my job, Baumholtzer? I get 
paid a good salary, and nothing 
ever happens to make me sweat 
to earn it. I shouldn't have any 
worries." He sighed. "But I do, 
Baumholtzer, I do. For fifteen 
years I have sat in this office and 
waited for somebody to invent a 
matter duplicator." 

I'd thought of that, too, but 
our part-time lab technician had 
mumbled something about the 
conservation of matter and energy. He had a hard time making 
it stick, though, with those fourteen bills, identical down to a 
whisky stain in one corner, staring him in the face. 

Still, one of the first things you 
learn in this racket is not to go off 
half-cocked. Saxegaard knew that, 
too, because he said, "All right, 



Baumholtzer, off to Deneb XI 
with you, and find out if anyone 
in that neighborhood has a matter duplicator, or if he hasn't, 
what he has got that looks so 
much like it." 

He looked at his watch and lit 
another cigarette. 

1LIT a cigarette and wished I. 
hadn't. The hot fog that passes for atmosphere on Deneb XI 
washed out my lungs and made 
the smoke taste like well-decayed leaf mold. I dragged a sleeve 
across my face, removing the 
sweat from my brow and replacing it with sweat from my arm. 

Deneb XI is a jungle world, 
with climate and insects to 
match. I leaned my tired and 
dripping body against a wall and 
slapped limply at a specimen of 
insect that could have given a 
Brazilian mosquito cards and 
spades. I cursed it with damp 
enthusiasm and enjoyed my view 
of the capital city of Deneb XI. 

This jewel in the diadem of the 
UnGalac was a motley collection 
of structures that looked as if 
they had been deposited there by 
the last high tide. This capital 
city — whose name, take it or 
leave it, was Glub — was also the 
only city on Deneb XI, which 
was the one reason it had endeared itself to me. 

I have my suspicions that the 
Denebians have yet to invent the 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



39 



wheel. At any rate, practically 
the only way to get around the 
planet is on foot. Not that checking every bank and electronicsupply shop in Glub was any 
Sunday promenade. My feet kept 
reminding me of that. 

The insect got in between me 
and the wall at this point, and 
stabbed me in the back. I consigned matter duplicators, blankfaced store owners, and prissy 
bank managers to the same gooey 
hell, smashed the insect against 
the wall, and headed for a bar. 

One nice thing about Deneb — 
the natives are too primitive to 
run things, so practically all the 
people who do anything important in Glub are Terrestrials, or 
at least members of the Terrestrial Federation, in whose territory 
Dencb XI lies. I not only found 
a bartender who spoke UnGalac, 
but one who knew what a Tom 
Collins was. It was a bright spot 
in an otherwise abysmal day. 

I carried my gloss over to a 
tabh and stretched out on the 
chair beside it. I would have been 
a more or less contented man if 
it hadn't been for the knowledge 
that I'd have to be up and back 
to my fruitless clod-hopping in 
a few minutes. I had yet to discover anyone who was buying 
more than a normal amount of 
electronic parts, or who had 
bought same at any time in the 
recent past. 



The banks were no better. Nobody had pushed large amounts 
of money across their plates recently, nobody had brought in 
any duplicate bills for investigation, nobody had deposited bills 
with identical serial numbers. If 
I asked a clerk how come fourteen duplicates had gotten 
through, the answer was that it 
must have been during Harry's 
shift, or Moe's, or Maxie's. Anybody's but theirs. I'd found seven 
defective beeper plates in five 
banks, but taking the wind out 
of the sails of caspetitious bank 
managers wasn't helping me find 
my man. 

I took one last drag on the 
Tom Collins and was about to 
leave when I looked up and saw 
an interesting individual standing 
over my table. 

TTE was a Terrestrial, but he'd 
been on Deneb a long time, 
because he was wearing the floursack type of garment the natives 
have. His hair, which was potatofield gray, was parted in the middle and curled around his 
temples and led back behind his 
ears. The ears had little pieces 
of bone in them. His eyes were 
corniced with the biggest damned 
eyebrows I ever saw, and his 
ping-pong-ball nose was thrust 
out of a clump of whiskers. He 
stood about six eight and must 
have weighed close to one hun


40 




 



dred pounds, saturated. 

I lay back and enjoyed the 
sight for a while. He stared right 
back, but I guess he got tired of 
playing look-me-in-the-eye, because the whiskers moved and 
the apparition spoke. 

"Mr. Baumholtzer?" it queried 
in a disappointingly normal 
voice. 

"True," I confessed. 

"The same Mr. Baumholtzer 
who has been going around asking all those questions about duplicate UnGalac notes?" 

"Probably. What's your trouble, Mr—?" I let it trail off in 
the time-honored fashion. 

"Munger," he answered. "Duodecimus Munger." 

"This bids fair to become fascinating," F said, wondering 
whether it would be Moe or Maxie that was going to get the blame 
for letting my name and assignment leak out. "Won't you pull 
up a chair, Mr. Munger?" 

"I'm afraid I won't have time," 
he answered in a flustered voice. 
"Are you really the Mr. Baumholtzer that's working on this 
case for the Treasury Department?" 

"Yeah, sure," I answered. 
"Why ? You're not the fellow 
that's turning out these duplicates, are you?" Which stands as 
the leading question of the year, 
because Munger rummaged 
around in the folds of his toga 



and came up with a Mistral coagulator, which he then pointed 
at my head. 

"I am," he said. 

The bartender hit the floor 
with a crash and I put my hands 
on the edge of the table. "Let's 
not make any rash decisions, 
now," I said, wondering if I 
could get to my own pacifier before he fused my brains solid. 

Munger shook his head. "I 
can't very well see how I could 
let you live." 

"Aw, come on, try," I answered, and tilted the table into the 
pit of his stomach at the same 
time I dived for the floor. 

The Mistral belched and mummified a potted plant behind me. 
The table smashed against the 
floor. 

Munger said "Oh, drat!" and 
landed with a sound like a pool 
cue bouncing on linoleum. I 
scrambled over the table and 
managed to raise an arm and 
swipe at his jaw. I missed, but I 
hit the Mistral, which flew across 
the room and broke open, immolating every bug in that vicinity, but rendering itself obsolete 
at the same moment. 

Munger made an annoyed 
sound and clubbed me on the 
jaw. I started to pass out, and he 
put his hands around my neck, 
but right about then the bartender let out a yelp that must have 
attracted some attention, because 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



feet came running toward the bar 
from out in the street. 

Munger repeated his expression 
of annoyance and smacked me 
another one. This time I went 
under. 

SOMETHING wet was dabbing 
my face I opened my eyes, 
and there was the bartender with 
a wet rag. 

"All right, where is he?" I 
asked. 

The bartender gave me a 
frightened look. "He's gone. He 
ran out when I yelled. I came 
right over and started to bring 
you to. You haven't been unconscious for more than a minute. 
That's because I came right over 
and started to bring you to. He 
ran out when I yelled, you know." 

"Which way did he go, Galahad?" 

"I — I don't know. I didn't have 
time to notice after I yelled and 
came over to — " 

"Stuff it!" I said, threw him 
off, and ran out the back door. 

Naturally, there wasn't a trace 
of Munger. I tried the front, but 
there was a small crowd out there, 
and he hadn't gone that way. 

I walked back to the bar, "All 
right, bright eyes," I said, "feed 
me another Collins. And don't 
put any little sprigs of mint in 
it." 

"Well, you don't have to get 
huffy about it!" he said. 



REALLY, Mr. Baumholtzer, 
there's no need to be excited 
about this unfortunate occurrence," the police inspector said. 
He leaned back in his chair and 
gazed at the end of his cigar. 
"This man was an obvious maniac. We'll pick him up on your 
complaint in a day or two, and 
he'll eventually wind up in a psycho ward." 

I sighed. I was getting worse 
than nowhere. I reached into my 
pocket and pulled out my buzzer. I flung it on his desk. 

"This badge says I'm a Treasury Agent, so don't go treating 
me like an ordinary taxpayer. 
I'm here investigating a counterfeiting case and this guy's in it 
up to his conspicuous ears. Now 
let's see some action!" 

I wasn't supposed to let anyone in on my job, but the news 
was already all over town, so the 
cops might as well be enlightened, 
too. 

The inspector's eyebrows went 
up. "Counterfeiting?" I could 
hear the wheels running around 
loose inside his head. "Alaric!" 
he yelled all of a sudden. "Alaric! Get me the Munger file!" He 
turned back to me with a pieeating grin on his face. "I'm sorry, Mr. Baumholtzer, I'm afraid 
I was telling you something of a 
white lie. 

"You see," he went on. "we get 
a number of complaints about 



42 




 



Munger, but he's apparently a 
very wealthy man. He's a trader 
or something at a native village 
in the interior, and once or twice 
a year he comes out and raises a 
little hell. He scares people sometimes and I thought this was one 
of those cases. But counterfeiting? Well!" 
"Yeah," I said. 

I had a hunch the inspector 
was kind of worried that some of 
Munger's money might have 
found its way to him. I wouldn't 
have any real trouble with the 
inspector, though. He could be 
bought, but he wouldn't stay 
bought. Not if any big trouble 
came up, anyway. % 

"You say he was a trader?" I 
asked, trying to pass time until 
the file came up. "How docs this 
tie in with a matter duplicator?" 

"Matter duplicator!" The inspector turned pale. "You mean 
those counterfeits of his are identical copies of the real thing?" 

"That's the idea." 

"You don't say!" 

He was fighting hard not to 
dig into his wallet and take a 
thorough, nervous look. 

FILL your bathtub full of mud. 
Build a fire under it, turn on 
the hot shower, and crawl in. 
Wallow. Do that and you've got 
a fair idea of the Denebian jungle. 

Never mind the trees. The in


spector and I had been plowing 
along for half a day and I hadn't 
seen a tree yet — the rain was too 
thick. I ran into them and I still 
couldn't see them, maybe because 
there was mud all over me every 
time I picked myself up. I'd 
stumble on until the rain washed 
me off. and then I'd hit another 
tree, and ploppo! 

The inspector led the way. 
stopping to consult a compass 
and a map once in a while. He 
was all eagerness. 

Finally, he put out a hand and 
stopped me. I looked up and realized there was no rain corning 
down on me at about the same 
time I saw the leaf-thatched roof. 

"Rain shelter." he explained. 
"The natives build them. This 
one's not too far from Munger's 
village. We'll rest a while and — " 
The inspector's mouth hung open. 

I turned around and there, in 
the hw corner of the shelter, stood 
Munger and a couple of -natives 
armed with spears. 

"Coincidence, what?" Munger 
asked, grinning nastily. He turned to the natives and said something that I swear sounded like 
"Itchy scratchy." but it must 
have meant "Take care of 'em 
for me. boys," or something likethat, because they moved in on 
us. 

One of the lads had the point 
of his spear right in my middle 
or I would have tried to break 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



43 



for it, but the inspector was luckier. 

"I'll get help!" he yelled, and 
took off into the mud like a bigbottomed turtle. 

The native that was supposed 
to handle him took off after him, 
but the inspector had the advantage of feet developed through 
years of pounding beats. The native realized almost immediately 
that he was up against superior 
talent, tried a perfunctory cast of 
his spear, and then came sloshing 
back to our little tableau. 

"Well, Mr. Baumholtzer, your 
companion's action has saved 
your life, for a while," Munger 
-said. "Now we'll have to hold 
you as a hostage in case help 
should arrive." 

"Thanks," I said. 

I was looking at my native's 
loincloth. It was composed of 
tastefully arranged thousandcredit notes. 

" Itchy scratchy pretty damn 
quickie," Munger said, and this 
time it obviously meant "Let's 
get this jerk to the village, fellows," because that's what they 
did. 

npHE jungle echoed to the thunder of a huge drum. In the 
flickering firelight, naked figures 
swayed and leaped, and bare feet 
thudded on a log platform in the 
center of the village. The rhythm 
vibrated through the platform 



until the air seemed to shudder, 
and the tremors shook my trussed-up body. 

"flrr-room ! Boom!" 
- A strident keening rose from 
the savage throats and distant 
huts sent back the echo of the 
primal wail. The firelight gleamed from the polished skin of Duodecimus Munger, who had 
doffed the formal toga and assumed the simple loincloth of the 
jungle. He stood impassively beside me, his arms folded, staring 
out with brooding eyes over the 
people he ruled. In the fire's 
gleam, he was as much a savage 
as they, and the majesty of his 
bearing spoke more loudly than 
words that he was their king. 

He inclined his head toward 
me and spoke. 

"It's amazing, the nonsense 
you have to take with these people." he said. "This clambake, for 
instance. They're propitiating the 
spirit of the tree. Why? I don't 
know. Damn tree's never failed 
yet." He indicated a majestic 
giant of the jungle with a nod. 
"But no. they've got to go into 
this marathon every night before 
I do my stuff. This'll keep up to 
dawn and I'll be dead on my feet 
tomorrow, but we got to have the 
stinkin' dance." He shook his 
head in disgust. "Jesus. I wish 
I had a fifth handy. I've been 
drinking this native bilge for too 
long." 



44 




 



Then he went back into his 
cigar store Indian act. 

He was right. We were up until 
the sun rose and that racket 
didn't knock off for an instant. I 
had all that time to sit there, trying to figure out where Munger 
was making those duplicate bills, 
and what was so important about 
that tree. Needless to say, I didn't 
reach any illuminating conclusions. That drum kept pounding 
away like crazy. If I could have 
gotten loose somehow, I would 
have grabbed my gun, which 
Munger now had strapped to his 
waist, and shot that berserk 
drummer before even thinking 
about making a break for it. 

Finally the sun came up and 
the Denebians quit howling. 
Neither Munger nor I were in a 
mood for small talk or pleasant 
conversation by that time. He 
picked me up and put me on my 
feet. 

"Let's go, Baumholtzer," he 
said. "Now you'll discover just 
how it's done." 

"Good of you to show me,*' I 
said. "I suppose this means I'll 
never live to tell about it." 

"That's very sensible of you. I 
like a man who can face facts." 

walked across the log 
** platform to the base of the 
tremendous tree in whose honor 
the recent brawl had been held. I 
still couldn't see the connection. 



but I was willing to wait. 

I didn't have to. Not very long, 
anyway. Munger reached into a 
pouch on his loincloth and pulled 
out a bill. I looked at it. It was 
either another of the duplicates 
I'd brought into Saxegaard's office, or else it was the parent bill. 

"I don't use the thousand-credit note unless the natives need 
new loincloths," Munger explained over his shoulder. "These fifties are a lot easier to dispose of." 

"The hell they are," I said. 
"How'd I find you?" 

"That was a mistake." he answered testily. "The minute I've 
got enough of these made, I sell 
them to certain — ah — contacts 
of mine for fifty per cent of face 
value. What you caught was a 
sample batch one of my former 
contacts spent through misguided 
avarice." 

"Less talk and more action," 
I said. I didn't even have to guess 
what had happened to his "contact" and I was impatient to see 
how he was going to get a tree 
to duplicate his money for him. 

"All right," he said, pulling my 
gun out of his belt. "I used to 
have the natives make a loud 
noise, but this will be infinitely 
more efficient." 

He'd folded the fifty-credit 
bill into a paper airplane while 
we'd been talking. Now he held 
it in his right hand, ready to 
launch at the tree, while he 



PROTECTIVE MIMICRY 



45 



raised my gun in his left. Behind 
us, the murmurs among the natives cut down into silence. The 
tree's big leaves rustled loudly in 
the silence. 

Bam! The gun went off and the 
folded bill flew at the tree. It 
sailed into the foliage. 

There was a popping noise. 



Followed by another. And another. More. More, infinitely more, 
and still more, until all I could 
hear was pop! pop! pop! 

The bill came sailing back out 
of the foliage. Right behind it 
came another one, and behind 
these came flight groups, squadrons, wings, armadas of paper 



16 




 



airplanes that were fifty-credit 
noces! They scattered out in all 
directions from the strangely 
moving foliage, and sailed around 
over tne native village. 

"Well, what do you know?" I 
said blankly, my mouth open. An 
airplane flew into it. I pulled the 
plane out and carefully umolded 
it, staring at it with bulging eyes. 
It was as genuine as the day is 
long. All around me the natives 
were going crazy, running and 
jumping around, picking airplanes out of the air and off the 
ground, stuffing them into little 
bags they had ready. 

Munger turned around and 
looked at me. "Startling, isn't 
it?" he asked politely. 

"Protective mimicry!" I yelled, suddenly realizing. 

He nodded. "Precisely. I discovered this tree six years ago. I 
was lost while attempting to 
evade the clutches of the law on 
a confidence rap. I swung an ax 
at the damn thing to blaze a trail, 
and I almost got scalped. Fifty 
axes came bouncing back at me." 

"But how did anything ever 
develop mimicry to this extent? 
I've heard of animals and insects 
assuming the forms of dangerous 
life-forms as camouflage, but 
never to this degree." 

"Search me," Munger said. 
"The Eglins contacted this world 
centuries ago, before the Terrestrials took this federation away 



from them. They were great little 
experimenters, the Eglins." 

"Hram. It does look funny, just 
this one tree like this. Maybe it 
was some kind of experimental 
plant. It is just one tree, isn't it?" 
I asked hastily. 

"Definitely. After I became 
buddies with the natives and set 
up this village here, I had them 
scour the jungle for another like 
it, but no go." 

"Hell, one's good enoufh. What 
a setup! You scare the tree with 
a loud noise, and it obliges by 
duplicating what it thinks is the 
menace. Brother!" 

"That's what I said when those 
axes came at me," Munger said. 
He was facing me, with fifty credit bills settling down all 
around him, and now he raised

my gun. "Well, Baumholtzer, it 
looks as though your pal didn't 
bring help, after all. I'll miss your 
company." 

He began tightening on the 
trigger, and I started to sweat. 

Suddenly there was an outbreak of yelling on the other side 
of the village. A gun went off and 
several spears slashed through 
the air. 

"The cops!" Munger stood 
staring at the inspector and his 
men as they broke into the open 
from the edge of the jungle. 
"They must have sneaked up 
after surprising my lookouts!" 

Munger raised my gun again. 
"I'll still get you, though!" 

I charged at him, hoping he'd 



miss the first shot. 

He didn't fire it before I plowed into him. We rolled onto the 
ground and I grabbed for him, 
but he scrambled away. I stumbled back against the tree just 
as he fired and missed me. 

WELL, that's about if. Here 
we sit in the spaceport on 
Deneb XI, waiting for the government to get around to sending out a ship to pick us all up. 

Once Munger missed his shot, 
the fight was over, for obvious 
reasons. He didn't stand a chance 
against us. 

Yeah, us. All one hundred and 
sixty-eight of me.

FORECAST 

Coming up next month is THE OLD DIE RICH by H. L. Gold, o grimly 
realistic novella based on news items that you've read repeatedly, wondered about for a short while, and then shrugged away as impossible to 
explain. But there is an explanation . . , one that the reporters ore unable 
to track down . . . unless, to all the other necessary qualifications, they add 
willingness to commit suicide in order to get the information! 

Illustrating the lead story is another CAMERAGE cover, the astonishing 
photographic montage process first displayed on the December 1952 
GALAXY. 

Look forward also to two stimulating novelets: 

HORSE TRADER by Poul Anderson puts Earth in a peculiar commercial 
position— selling things it never had to interstellar visitors who haven't the 
cash or goods to buy them. 

STUDENT BODY by F. L. Wallace begins with an error made by a 
research crew. That wouldn't be so appalling if the researching crew 
weren't infallible and if the mistake stopped getting more and more 
complex and bewildering.

IF she's dead, I thought, I'll 
never find her in this white 
flood of moonlight on the 
white sea, with the surf seething 
in and over the pale, pale sand 
like a great shampoo. Almost 
always, suicides, who stab themselves or shoot themselves in the 
heart carefully bare their chests; 
the same strange impulse generally makes the sea-suicide go 
naked. 

A little earlier, I thought, or 
later, and there would be shadows for the dunes and the breathing toss of the foam. Now the 
only real shadow was mine, a 
tiny thing just under me, but 
black enough to feed the blackness of the shadow of a blimp. 

A Jittle earlier, I thought, and 
I might have seen her plodding 
up the silver shore, seeking a 
place lonely enough to die in. A 
little later and my legs would 
rebel against this shuffling trot 
through sand, the maddening 
sand that could not hold and 
would not help a hurrying man. 

My legs did give way then and 
I knelt suddenly, sobbing — not 
for her; not yet — just for air. 
There was such a rush about me: 
wind, and tangled spray, and 
colors upon colors and shades of 
colors that were not colors at all 
but shifts of white and silver. If 
light like that were sound, it 
would sound like the sea on sand, 
and if my ears were eyes, they 





would see such a light. 

I crouched there, gasping in 
the swirl of it, and a flood struck 
me, shallow and swift, turning 
up and outward like flower petals 
where it touched my knees, then

— perhaps I yelled — for she turned and saw me kneeling there. 
She put her fists to her temples 
and her face twisted, and she 
uttered a piercing wail of despair 
and fury, and then plunged seaward and sank. 

I kicked off my shoes and ran 
into the breakers, shouting, hunting, grasping at flashes of white 
that turned to sea-salt and coldness in my fingers. I plunged 
right past her, and her body 
struck my side as a wave whipped my face and tumbled both 
of us. I gasped in solid water, 
opened my eyes beneath the surface and saw a greenish -white 
distorted moon hurtle as I spun. 
Then there was sucking sand under my feet again and my left 
hand was tangled in her hair. 

The receding wave towed her 
away and for a moment she 
streamed out from my hand like 
steam from a whistle. In that 
moment I was sure she was dead, 
but as she settled to the sand, 
she fought and scrambled to her 
feet. 

She hit my ear, wet, hard, and 
a huge pointed pain lanced into 
my head. She pulled, she lunged 
away from me, and all the while 
my hand was caught in her hair. 
I couldn't have freed her if I had 
wanted to. She spun to me with 
the next .wave, battered and 
clawed at me, and we went into 
deeper water. 



"Don't . . . don't ... I can't 
swim!" I shouted, so she clawed 
me again. 

"Leave me alone," she shrieked. "Oh, dear God, why can't 
you leave" (said her fingernails) 
"me . . ." (said her snapping 
teeth) "a/one/" (said her small 
hard fist). 

So by her hair I pulled her 
head down tight to her white 
shoulder; and with the edge of 
my free hand I hit her neck 
twice. She floated again, and I 
brought her ashore. 

I carried her to where a dune 
was between us and the sea's 
broad noisy tongue, and the wind 
was above us somewhere. But 
the light was as bright. I rubbed 
her wrists and- stroked her face 
and said, "It's all right," and, 
"There!" and some names I used 
to have for a dream I had long, 
long before I ever heard of her. 

She lay still on her back with 
the breath hissing between her 
teeth, with her lips in a smile 
which her twisted -tight, wrinklesealed eyes made not a smile but 
a torture. She was well and conscious for many moments and 
still her breath hissed and her 
closed eyes twisted. 

"Why couldn't you leave me 
alone?" she asked at last. She 
opened her eyes and looked at 
me. She had so much misery 
that there was no room for fear. 
She shut her eyes again and said. 



52 




 



"You know who I am." 
"I know," I said. 
She began to cry. 

T WAITED, and when she 
stopped crying, there were 
shadows among the dunes. A long 
time. 

She said, "You don't know 
who I am. Nobody knows who 
I am." 

I said, "It was in all the 
papers." 

"That!" She opened her eyes 
slowly and her gaze traveled over 
my face, my shoulders, stopped 
at my mouth, touched my eyes 
for the briefest second. She 
curled her lips and turned away 
her head. "Nobody knows who 
I am." 

I waited for her to move or 
speak, and finally I said "Tell 
me." 

"Who are you?" she asked, 
with her head still turned away. 
"Someone who . . ." 
"Well?" 

"Not now," I said* "Later, 
maybe." 

She sat up suddenly and tried 
to hide herself. "Where are my 
clothes?" 

"I didn't see them." 

"Oh," she said. "I remember. 
I put them down and kicked 
sand over them, just where a 
dune would come and smooth 
them over, hide them as if they 
never were ... I hate sand. I 



wanted to drown in the sand, but 
it wouldn't let me . . . You 
mustn't look at me!" she shouted. 
"I hate to have you looking at 
me!" She threw her head from 
side to side, seeking. "I can't 
stay here like this! What can I 
do? Where can I go?" 
"Here," I said. 

She let me help her up and 
then snatched her hand away, 
half-turned from me. "Don't 
touch me. Get away from me." 

"Here," I said again, and 
walked down the dune where it 
curved in the moonlight, tipped 
back into the wind and down 
and became not dune but beach. 
"Here." I pointed behind the 
dune. 

At last she followed me. She 
peered over the dune where it 
was chest-high, and again where 
it was knee-high. "Back there?" 

I nodded. 

"I didn't see them." 

"So dark . . ." She stepped 
over the low dune and into the 
aching black of those moonshadows. She moved away cautiously, feeling tenderly with her 
feet, back to where the dune was 
higher. She sank down into the 
blackness and disappeared there. 
I sat on the sand in the light. 
"Stay away from me," she spat. 

I rose and stepped back. Invisible in the shadows, she 
breathed, "Don't go away." I 
waited, then saw her hand press 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS 



out of the clean-cut shadows. 
"There," she said, "over there. 
In the dark. Just be a . . . Stay 
away from me now . . . Be a — 
voice." 

I did as she asked, and sat in 
the shadows perhaps six feet 
from her. 

She told me about it. Not the 
way it was in the papers. 

SHE was perhaps seventeen 
when it happened. She was 
in Central Park, in New York. It 
was too warm for such an early 
spring day, and the hammered 
brown slopes had a dusting 
of green of precisely the consistency of that morning's hoar 
frost on the rocks. But the frost 
was gone and the grass was brave 
and tempted some hundreds of 
pairs of feet from the asphalt and 
concrete to tread on it. 

Hers were among them. The 
sprouting soil was a surprise to 
her feet, as the air was to her 
lungs. Her feet ceased to be shoes 
as she walked, her body was 
consciously more than clothes. It 
was the only kind of day which 
in itself can make a city-bred 
person raise his eyes. She did. 

For a moment she felt separated from the life she lived, in 
which there was no fragrance,, no 
silence, in which nothing ever 
quite fit nor was quite filled. In 
that moment the ordered disapproval of the buildings around 



the pallid park could not reach 
her; for two, three clean breaths 
it no longer mattered that the 
whole wide world really belonged 
to images projected on a screen; 
to gently groomed goddesses in 
these steel and glass towers; that 
it belonged, in short, always, always to someone else. 

So she raised her eyes, and 
there above her was the saucer. 

It was beautiful. It was golden, with a dusty finish like that 
of an unripe concord grape. It 
made a faint sound, a chord composed of two tones and a blunted 
hiss like the wind in tall wheat. 
It was darting about like a swallow, soaring and dropping. It circled and dropped and hovered 
like a fish, shimmering. It was 
like all these living things, but 
with that beauty it had all the 
loveliness of things' turned and 
burnished, measured, machined, 
and metrical. 

At first she felt no astonishment, for this was so different 
from anything 'she had ever seen 
before that it had to be a trick 
of the eye, a false evaluation of 
size and speed and distance that 
in a moment would resolve itself 
into a sun-flash on an airplane 
or the lingering glare of a welding arc. 

She looked away from it and 
abruptly realized that many 
other people saw it — saw something — too. People all around her 



54 




 



had stopped moving and speaking and were craning upward. 
Around her was a globe of silent 
astonishment, and outside it she 
was aware of the life-noise of the 
city, the hard-breathing giant 
who never inhales. 

She looked up again, and at 
last began to realize how large 
and how far away the saucer 
was. No: rather, how small and 
how very near it was. It was just 
the size of the largest circle she 
might make with her two hands, 
and it floated not quite eighteen 
inches over her head. 

¥7*EAR came then. She drew 
back and raised a forearm, 
but the saucer simply hung there. 
She bent far sideways, twisted 
away, leaped forward, looked 
back and upward to see if she 
had escaped it. At first she couldn't see it; then as she looked up 
and up, there it was, close and 
gleaming, quivering and crooning, right over her head. 

She bit her tongue. 

From the corner of her eye, 
she saw a man cross himself. 
We did that because he saw me 
standing here with a halo over 
my head, she thought. And that 
was the greatest single thing that 
had ever happened to her. No 
one had ever looked at her and 
made a respectful gesture before, 
not once, not ever. Through terror, through panic and wonder


ment, the comfort of that thought 
nestled into her, to wait to be 
taken out and looked at again 
in lonely times. 

The terror was uppermost now, 
however. She backed away, staring upward, stepping a ludicrous 
Cakewalk. She should have collided with people. There were 
plenty of people there, gaping 
and craning, but she reached 
none. She spun around and discovered to her horror that she 
was the center of a pointing, 
pressing crowd. Its mosaic of 
eyes all bulged and its inner 
circle braced its many legs to 
press back and away from her. 

The saucer's gentle note deepened. It tilted, dropped an inch 
or so. Someone screamed, and 
the crowd broke away from her 
in all directions, milled about, 
and settled again in a new dynamic balance, a much larger 
ring, as more and more people 
raced to thicken it against the 
efforts of the inner circle to 
escape. 

The saucer hummed and tilted, 
tilted . . . 

She opened her mouth to 
scream, fell to her knees, and the 
saucer struck. 

It dropped against her forehead and clung there. It seemed 
almost to lift her. She came erect 
on her knees, made one effort to 
raise her hands against it. and 
then her arms stiffened down and

55 



back, her hands not reaching the 
ground. For perhaps a second 
and a half the saucer held her 
rigid, and then it passed a single 
ecstatic quiver to her body and 
dropped it. She plumped to the 
ground, the backs of her thighs 
heavy and painful on her heels 
and ankles. 

The saucer dropped beside her, 
rolled once in a small circle, once 
just around its edge, and lay 
still. It lay still and dull and 
metallic, different and dead. 

HAZILY, she lay and gazed 
at the gray-shrouded blue of 
the good spring sky, and hazily 
she heard whistles. 

And some tardy screams. 
And a great stupid voice bellowing "Give her air!" which 
made everyone press closer. 

Then there wasn't so much sky 
because of the blue-clad bulk 
with its metal buttons and its 
leatherette notebook. '*Okay , 
okay, what's happened here stand 
back figods sake." 

And the widening ripples of 
observation, interpretation and 
comment: "It knocked her 
down." "Some guy knocked her 
down." "He knocked her down." 
Some guy knocked her down 
and — " "Right in broad daylight 
this guy . . ," "The park's gettin' 
to be . . ." onward and outward, 
the adulteration of fact until it 
was lost altogether because ex


citement is so much more important. 

Somebody with harder a shoulder than the rest bulling close, a 
notebook here, too, a witnessing 
eye over it, ready to change ". . . 
a beautiful brunet . . ." to "an 
attractive brunet" for the afternoon editions, because "attractive" is as dowdy as any woman 
is allowed to get if she is a victim 
in the news. 

The glittering shield and the 
florid face bending close: "You 
hurt bad, sister?" And the 
echoes, back and back through 
the crowd, "Hurt bad, hurt bad. 
badly injured, he beat the hell 
out of her, broad daylight . . ." 

And still another man, slim 
and purposeful, tan gabardine, 
cleft chin and beard-shadow : 
"Flyin' saucer, hm? Okay, Officer, I'll take over here." 

"And who the hell might you 
be. takin' over?" 

The flash of a brown leather 
wallet, a face so close behind that 
its chin was pressed into the 
gabardine shoulder. The face 
said, awed: "F.B.I." and that 
rippled outward, too. The policeman nodded— the entire policeman nodded in one single bobbing genuflection. 

"Get some help and clear this 
area," said the gabardine. 

"Yes, sir/" said the policeman. 

"F. B. I., F. B. I.," the crowd 
murmured and there was more 



56 




 



sky to look at above her. 

She sat up and there was a 
glory in her face. "The saucer 
talked to me," she sang. 

"You shut up," said the gabardine. "You'll^ have lots of 
chance to talk later." 

"Yeah, sister," said the policeman. "My God. this mob could 
be full of Communists." 

"You shut up, too," said the 
gabardine. 

Someone in the crowd told 
someone else a Communist beat 
up this girl, while someone else 
was saying she got beat up because she was a Communist. 

SHE started to rise, but solicitous hands forced her down 
again. There were thirty police 
there by that time. 

"I can walk," she said. 
"Now you just take it easy," 
they told her. 

They put a stretcher down beside her and lifted her onto it 
and covered her with a big 
blanket. 

"I can walk," she said as they 
carried her through the crowd. 

A woman went white and 
turned away moaning, "Oh, my 
God, how awful!" 

A small man with round eyes 
stared and stared at her and 
licked and licked his lips. 

The ambulance. They slid her 
in. The gabardine was already 
there. 



A white-coated man with very 
clean hands: "How did it happen, miss?" 

"No questions," said the gabardine. "Security." 

The hospital. 

She said, "I got to get back to 
work." 

"Take your clothes off," they 
told her. 

She had a bedroom to herself 
then for the first time in her life. 
Whenever the door opened, she 
could see a policeman outside. 
It opened very often to admit 
the kind of civilians who were 
very polite to military people, 
and the kind of military people 
who were even more polite to 
certain civilians. She did not 
know what they all did nor what 
they wanted. Every single day 
they asked her four million five 
hundred thousand questions. Apparently they never talked to 
each other because each of them 
asked her the same questions 
over and over. 

"What is your name?" 

"How old are you?" 

"What year were you born?" 

"What is your name?" 

Sometimes they would push 
her down strange paths with 
their questions. 

"Now your uncle. Married a 
woman from Middle Europe, did 
he? Where in Middle Europe?" 

"What clubs or fraternal organizations did you belong to? 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS

Ah! Now about that Rinkeydinks 
gang on 63rd Street. Who was 
rePHy behind it?" 

But over and over again, 
"What did you mean when you 
said the saucer talked to you?" 

And she would say, "It talked 
to me." 

And they would say, "And it 
said — " 

And she would shake her head. 

There would be a lot of shouting ones, and then a lot of kind 
oiies. No one had ever been so 
kind to her before, but she soon 
learned that no one was being 
kind to her. They were just getting her to relax, to think of 
other things, so they could sudd*nly shoot that question at her: 
"What do you mean it talked to 
yOU?" 

PRETTY soon it was just like 
Mom's or school or any place, 
and she used to sit with her 
niouth closed and let them yell. 
Once they sat her on a hard chair 
for hours and hours with a light 
iii her eyes and let her get thirsty. 
Home, there was a transom over 
tlie bedroom door and Mom used 
to leave the kitchen light glaring 
through it all night, every night, 
so she wouldn't get the horrors, 
go the light didn't bother her at 

They took her out of the hospital and put her in jail. Some 
^ays it was good. The food. The 



bed was all right, too. Through 
the window she could see lots of 
women exercising in the yard. It 
was explained to her that they 
all had much harder beds. 

"You are a very important 
young lady, you know." 

That was nice at first, but as 
usual it turned out they didn't 
mean her at all. They kept working on her. Once they brought 
the saucer in to her. It was inside 
a big wooden crate with a padlock, and a steel box inside that 
with a Yale lock. It only weighed 
a couple of pounds, the saucer, 
but by the time they got it packed, it took two men to carry it 
and four men with guns to 
watch them. 

. They made her act out the 
whole thing just the way it happened, with some soldiers holding the saucer over her head. It 
wasn't the same. They'd cut a 
lot of chips and pieces out of the 
saucer and, besides, it was that 
dead gray color. They asked her 
if she knew anything about that 
and for once she told them. 

"It's empty now," she said. 

The only one she would ever 
talk to was a little man with a 
fat belly who said to her the first 
time he was alone with her, 
"Listen, I think the way they've 
been treating you stinks. Now 
get this: I have a job to do. My 
job is to find out why you won't 
tell what the saucer said. I don't 



J8 




 



want to know what it said and 
111 never ask you. I don't even 
want you to tell me. Let's just 
find out why you'ic' keeping it a 
secret." 

Finding out why turned out to 
be hours of just talking about 
having pneumonia and the flower 
pot she made in second grade 
that Mom threw down the fire 
escape and getting left back in 
school and the dream about holding a wine glass in both hands 
and peeping over it at some man. 

And one day she told him why 
she wouldn't say about the saucer, just the way it came to her: 
"Because it was talking to me, 
and it's just nobody else's business." 

She even told him about the 
man crossing himself that day. It 
was the only other thing she had 
of her own. 

He was nice. He was the one 
who warned her about the trial. 
"I have no business saying this, 
but they're going to give you the 
full dress treatment. Judge and 
jury and all. You just say what 
you want to say, no less and no 
more, hear? And don't let 'em 
get your goat. You have a right 
to own something." 

He got up and swore and left. 

¥TMRST a man came and talked 
*■ to her for a long time about 
how maybe this Earth would be 
attacked from outer space by 



beings much stronger and cleverer than we are, and maybe she 
had the key to a defense. So she 
owed it to the whole world. And 
then even if the Earth wasn't attacked, just think of what an advantage she might give this 
country over its enemies. Then 
he shook his finger in her face 
and said that what she was doing 
amounted to working for the 
enemies of her country. And he 
turned out to be the man that 
was defending her at the trial. 

The jury found her guilty of 
contempt of court and the judge 
recited a long list of penalties he 
could give her. He gave her one 
of them and suspended it. They 
put her back in >ail for a 'few 
more days, and one fine day they 
turned her loose. 

That was wonderful at first. 
She got a job in a restaurant and 
a furnished room. She had been 
in the papers so much that Mom 
didn't want her back home. Mom 
was drunk most of the time and 
sometimes used to tear up the 
whole neighborhood, but all the 
same she had very special ideas 
about being respectable, and being in the papers all the time for 
spying was not her idea of being 
decent. So she put her maiden 
name on the mailbox downstairs 
and told her daughter not to live 
there any more. 

At the restaurant she met a 
man who asked her for a date. 



SAUCER OF LONELINESS 



59 



The first time. She spent every 
cent she had on a red handbag 
to go with her red shoes. They 
weren't the same shade, but anyway they were both red. They 
went to the movies and afterward he didn't try to kiss her or 
anything, he just tried to find out 
what the flying saucer told her. 
She didn't say anything. She 
went home and cried all night. 

Then some men sat in a booth 
talking and they shut up and 
glared at her every time she 
came past. They spoke to the 
boss, and he came and told her 
that they were electronics engineers working for the government and they were afraid to 
talk shop while she was around 
— wasn't she some sort of spy or 
something? So she got fired. 

Once she saw her name on a 
juke box. She put in a nickel and 
punched that number, and the 
record was all about "the flyin' 
saucer came down one day, and 
taught her a brand new way to 
play, and what it was I will not 
say, but she took me out of this 
world." And while she was listening to it, someone in the jukejoint recognized her and called 
her by name. Four of them followed her home and she had to 
block the door shut. 

SOMETIMES she'd be all 
right for months on end. and 
then someone would ask for a 



date. Three times out of five, she 
and the date were followed. Once 
the man she was with arrested 
the man who was tailing them. 
Twice the man who was tailing 
them arrested the man she was 
with. Five times out of five, the 
date would try to find out about 
the saucer. Sometimes she would 
go out with someone and pretend 
that it was a real date, but she 
wasn't very good at it. 

So she moved to the shore and 
got a job cleaning at night in offices and stores. There weren't 
many to clean, but that just 
meant there weren't many people 
to remember her face from the 
papers. Like clockwork, every 
eighteen months, some feature 
writer would drag it all out again 
in a magazine or a Sunday supplement; and every time anyone 
saw a headlight on a mountain or 
a light on a weather balloon it 
had to be a flying saucer, and 
there had to be some tired quip 
about the saucer wanting to tell 
secrets. Then for two or three 
weeks she'd stay off the streets 
in the daytime. 

Once she thought she had it 
whipped. People didn't want her, 
so she began reading. The novels were all right for a while 
until she found out that most of 
them were like the movies — all 
about the pretty ones who really 
own the world. So she learned 
things — animals, trees. A lousy 



60 




 



little chipmunk caught in a wire 
fence bit her. The animals didn't 
want her. The trees didn't care. 

Then she hit on the idea of the 
bottles. She got all the bottles she 
could and wrote on papers which 
she corked into the bottles. She'd 
tramp miles up and down the 
beaches and throw the bottles out 
as far as she could. She knew 
that if the right person found 
one, it would give that person 
the only thing in the world that 
would help. Those bottles kept 
her going for three solid years. 
Everyone's got to have a secret 
little something he does. 

And at last the time came 
when it was no use any more. 
You can go on trying to help 
someone who maybe exists; but 
soon you can't pretend there is 
such a person any more. And 
that's it. The end. 

" A RE you cold?" I asked when 
she was through telling me. 

The surf was quieter and the 
shadows longer. 

"No," she answered from the 
shadows. Suddenly she said, "Did 
you think I was mad at you because you saw me without my 
clothes?" 

"Why shouldn't you be?" 

"You know, I don't care? I 
wouldn't have wanted . . . wanted 
you to see me even in a ball gown 
or overalls. You can't cover up 
my carcass. It shows; it's there 



whatever. I just didn't 'want you 
to see me. At all." 

"Me, or anyone?" 

She hesitated. "You." 

I got up and stretched and 
walked a little, thinking. "Didn't 
the F.B.I, try to stop you throwing those bottles?" 

"Oh, sure. They spent I don't 
know how much taxpayers' 
money gathering 'em up. They 
still make a spot check every 
once in a while. They're getting 
tired of it, though. All the writing 
in the bottles is the same." She 
laughed, I didn't know she could. 

"What's funny?" 

"All of 'em — judges, jailers, 
juke-boxes — people. Do you 
know it wouldn't have saved me 
a minute's trouble if I'd told 'em 
the whole thing at the very beginning?" 

"No?" 

"No. They wouldn't have believed me. What they wanted was 
a new weapon. Super-science 
from a super-race, to slap hell 
out of the super-race if they ever 
got a chance, or out of our own 
if they don't. All those brains," 
she breathed, with more wonder 
than scorn, "alt that brass. They 
think 'super-race' and it comes 
out 'super- science.' Don't they 
ever imagine a super-race has 
super- feelings, too — super-laughter, maybe, or super-hunger?" 
She paused. "Isn't it time you 
asked me what the saucer said?"

"I'll tell you," I blurted. 

"There is in certain living souls 
A quality of loneliness unspeakable. 

So great it must be shared 
As company is shared oy fosse r 
beings. 

Such a loneliness is mine; so know 

by this 
That in immensity 
There is one lonelier than you." 

"Dear Jesus," she said devoutly, and began to weep. "And how 
is it addressed?" 

"To the loneliest one . . ." 

"How did you know?" she 
whispered. 

"It's what you put in the bottles, isn't it?" 

"Yes," she said. "Whenever it 
gets to be too much, that no one 
cares, that no one ever did . . . 
you throw a bottle into the sea, 
and out goes a part of your own 
loneliness. You sit and think of 
someone somewhere finding it 
. . . learning for the first time that 
the worst there is can be understood." 

The moon was setting and the 
surf was hushed. We looked up 
and out to the stars. She said, 
"We don't know what loneliness 
is like. People thought the saucer 
was a saucer, but it wasn't. It was 
a bottle with a message inside. It 
had a bigger ocean to cross — all 
of space — and not much chance 
of finding anybody. Loneliness? 
We don't know loneliness." 

When I could, I asked her why 



she had tried to kill herself. 

"I've had it good," she said, 
"with what the saucer told me. 
I wanted to . . . pay back. I was 
bad enough to be helped; I had 
to know I was good enough to 
help. Wo one wants me? Fine. 
But don't tell me no one, anywhere, wants my help. I can't 
stand that." 

I took a deep breath. "I found 
one of your bottles two years 
ago. I've been looking for you 
ever since. Tide charts, current 
tables, maps and . . . wandering. 
I heard some _talk about you and 
the bottles hereabouts. Someone 
told me you'd quit doing it, you'd 
taken to wandering the dunes at 
night. I knew why. I ran all the 
way." 

I needed another breath now. 
"I got a club foot. I think right, 
but the words don't come out of 
my mouth the way they're inside

The Ice Age (III) 



A FEW issues back, I quoted 
the French astronomer 
Gerard de Vaucouleurs 
as having said that the surface of Mars can be likened to 
a terrestrial desert, moved to the 
Arctic and lifted to stratospheric 



heights. I should have added that 
Monsieur de Vaucouleurs introduced one unnecessary move. 
Lifting the desert to stratospheric 
heights would be enough; that 
would not only thin the air over 
the desert, it would also cool it. 




FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



This thought is the basis of a 
little known theory of the origin 
of the Ice Ages, offered by the 
Austri an geologist Prof. Doctor 
Franz Xaver Schaffer. It has been 
mentioned earlier that Schaffer's 
compatriot. Prof. Melchior Neumayr, had shown that a comparatively slight drop in the 
average temperature, some 6 to 
8 degrees Fahrenheit, would account for all the observed phenomena, provided only that it 
lasted long enough. Schaffer, 
about 40 years later, brought in 
the additional fact that the 
average temperature of, say, Vienna, is 6 to 8 degrees lower 2000 
feet above that city. 

So far, this sounds like a wonderfully simple idea. If one could 
prove that, at the time of the 
glaciations, the land masses of 
at least the northern hemisphere 
had been 2000 feet higher than 
now, the whole difficult problem 
would resolve itself neatly and 
easily. 

That figure of 2000 feet must 
not be misunderstood ; it does 
not have to mean 2000 feet higher 
above sea level, for the sea level 
may have been different itself in 
the past. 

Probably the best way of 
phrasing it is to say that the land 
level of the northern hemisphere 
is supposed to have been under an 
average air pressure of about 700 
millimeters, instead of the 760 



millimeters which is the present 
norm. 

Unfortunately, Prof. Schaffer 
could not show any evidence 
tending to prove such a higher 
elevation. In fact, he has to torture existing evidence to a good 
extent by declaring, for example, 
that this or that glaciation described in the textbooks was not 
a "true" glaciation at all, but 
that these geological traces upon 
which the textbook statement 
rests "happen to be misleading." 
In short, the neat idea did not 
work out. 

But the fundamental assumption — namely, that the cause of 
the ice ages has to be sought in 
the atmosphere instead of somewhere in space — is rather logical. 
It was upon this assumption that 
the noted Swedish scientist Svante 
Arrhenius began building a famous theory half a century ago. 

A S for Svante Arrhenius himself : even those who do not 
confuse him with a Swedish 
botanist of the same name usually consider him an astronomer or 
an astrophysicist. Although much 
of the work done by him in his 
later life belonged in the realm 
of cosmology and encroached 
heavily upon astrophysics, he 
was originally a chemist. 

Being a chemist, he was struck 
by the thought that the underlying cause for climatic changes 



64 




 



might be changes in the chemical composition of the atmosphere. 

The present norm, expressed 
without fractions, is 21 per cent 
oxygen, 78 per cent nitrogen, 1 
per cent argon and "traces." And, 
of course, a varying amount of 
water vapor. The radiation of the 
Sun, the textbooks say, is absorbed by the ground and by the 
atmosphere. If the ground is 
covered with snow and ice, it will 
absorb less radiation, and as regards the atmosphere — wait a 
minute: just which part of the 
atmosphere does absorb infrared, or heat? It turned out to be 
one of the "traces," carbon dioxide (CO;.), which constitutes only 
0.03 per cent of the atmosphere 
near the ground. One other gas 
which is also especially active in 
retaining heat is water vapor. 

Arrhenius made a little calculation. Supposing that there were 
no carbon dioxide in the air at 
all, what would that do to the 
climate? 

The result was devastating, 
even though it was merely a figure on paper. The average would 
drop by about 30 degrees Fahrenheit! 

Furthermore, since a drop of 
30 degrees F. would freeze all the 
water vapor out of the atmosphere, there would be an additional drop due to the absence of 
water vapor. This would be an 



estimated 20 degrees — about 50 
degrees altogether. It would spell 
Antarctica for both temperate 
zones and quite a lot of grief 
even for the tropics. 

The next step in the reasoning 
ran as follows: if the climatic 
variations correspond to fluctuations in the carbon dioxide (and 
along with it the water vapor) 
content of the atmosphere, what 
could be the reason for such fluctuation? How does the carbon 
dioxide originate? 

The layman is apt to think of 
gigantic forest fires, presumably 
caused by lightning. It is true that 
such fires do contribute, but it 
isn't so much a question of quantity, since the total in the atmosphere is quite small, but rather of 
steadiness of supply. Most forests 
don't burn down. (Actually, industrial activity and households 
contribute more than natural 
fires, just because they are steady 
producers). 

The main suppliers of carbon 
dioxide are the volcanoes and 
other phenomena associated with 
them. 

The main consumers are the 
oceans. According to Arrhenius, 
they absorb slightly more than 
80 per cent of the gas. Next biggest consumer is erosion which, 
like plant life, ties the carbon 
dioxide chemically. In the seas, 
much of it is also tied up by organisms other than plants, but

they can get only at the carbon 
dioxide in the water. 

PERIODS of volcanic activity 
with much carbon dioxide in 
the air-— say, V£ °f one P er cent — 
would be periods of warmth and 
of luxurious plant life. But, Aithenius pointed out, each such 
period contains the beginnings of 
its own end. Volcanic activity is 
somehow connected with mountain building — we don't have to 
go into the question of whether 
it causes, is accompanied by, or 
is the result of mountain building 
— and these mountains erode 
while still rising. The plants 
thrive in the high carbon dioxide 
content, gulping what they can. 
The multitudes of sea things do 
the same, depleting the waters of 
carbon dioxide so that the ocean 
will absorb more. 

As the Department of Economics would say : with everything 
geared to high consumption, a 
slackening of production means 
depletion of the reserves. In less 
forbidding language: as soon as 
the volcanoes calm down, the 
carbon dioxide content of the 
atmosphere also goes down, and 
so does the average temperature. 

After Arrhenius had stated his 
general concept, a professional 
geologist, Dr. Fritz Freeh of 
Breslau, tried to fit this scheme 
to the actual geologic past. He 
claimed that two full cycles could 



actually be found geologically. 

There was this very early 
Cambrian glaciation near the beginning of the Earth's geological 
history which we know reasonably well. During the following 
two geological periods, the Silurian and Devonian, volcanic 
activity was heavy and the climate apparently grew uniformly 
warm, for corals from that time 
have been found in high latitudes. 
The plants conquered the land 
and, during the Carboniferous 
Period which followed the Devonian, they appear in incredible 
masses. Our coal deposits formed 
then — all this coal was at one 
time carbon dioxide which the 
plants took out of the atmosphere. 

Around the middle of that long 
Carboniferous Period, enormous 
mountain ranges formed in all 
continents, many of them eroding 
fast. Apparently there was little, 
if any, new volcanic supply for 
a while and the result was the 
Permian glaciation. 

This, according to Freeh, was 
the first complete cycle. The second began during the middle of 
the Permian Period, when there 
were enormous volcanic eruptions 
in the northern hemisphere. More 
of the same, especially in North 
America, occurred during the next 
period, the Triassic, and the 
Jurassic which followed after the 
Triassic. Warm climate, appar

ently without climatic zones. 
Corals in the seas above Scotland, marine reptiles as far North 
as Spitsbergen, palms and cycads 
near Baltimore. Dinosaurs. 

Near the end of the Cretaceous 
Period which followed the Jurassic, it looked as if there were 
hints of climatic zones. But before things slipped too badly — 
possibly because there were no 
recent mountain chains to erode 
in addition to the older ones — 
there were enormous basaltic 
eruptions in India. 

A T any event, the Tertiary 
Period which followed the 
Cretaceous began in full tropical 
splendor with swamp cypresses as 
far North as Ellesmere Island. 
Apparently it grew a bit cooler 
during the Oligocene, the second 
subdivision of the Tertiary 
Period, but again a series of gigantic basaltic eruptions intervened. The following subdivision, 
the Miocene, was warm again ; 
the lignite beds formed. Soon the 
great mountain chains of today 
began to grow — the Andes, the 
Himalayas, the Alps. Volcanism 
diminished during the last Tertiary subdivision, the Pliocene, 
and then seems to have stopped 
almost completely. The Ice Age 
came in. The volcanic cones we 
have now, including those which 
are dead, all formed later. 
And that is how Arrhenius and 



Freeh explained the past. It is 
hardly necessary to state that 
there is no beautiful and unanimous agreement with them. 

Some have pointed at big eruptions of historical times, like the 
Krakatoa catastrophe, which, by 
throwing millions of tons of dust 
into the atmosphere, caused cool 
summers and cold and wet winters. But it is only a special type 
of eruption which will do that, 
and a rare type at that. 

Others have found evidence for 
volcanic activity just at times 
where Freeh said there was none. 
To which Freeh's pupils replied, 
in essence, that even during a depression there are a few people 
who have money, but that these 
exceptions do not make prosperity. 

Still others have said that they 
admit that with 0.001 per cent 
carbon dioxide in the air, it would 
be colder, but that a surplus over 
what we have now won't make it 
warmer. 

Arrhenius stuck to his guns, or 
rather his calculations. 

We don't know the answer yet. 
But in time, we will. 

THE FOURTH DIMENSION 

npHERE was an exchange of 
inter office memos recently, 
beginning at my end. Mine read: 
"Horace, please stop printing stories about the fourth dimension 



FOR YOUR INFORMATION 



67 



like 'Star, Bright' because they 
cause too many letters." The reply: "Willy, are you really serious about this?" My answer : 
"Well, no, but I did get more letters about four-dimensional problems that month than about any 
other topic." 

These letters ranged from such 
one-sentence requests as "Please 
explain the Fourth Dimension" 
to communications of several 
pages and single-spaced which 
amounted to dissertations. If one 
conclusion could be drawn from 
all this, it is that the problem of 
the fourth dimension still excites 
lots of people. Another conclusion is that we seem to be dealing with a new generation of 
readers, for the older science fiction fans have been through this 
two decades ago. 

Now let's look at the fourth 
dimension first from the point of 
view of elementary mathematics. 
Reasoning here begins literally 
with a point which has no dimension at all. Move the point 
and you get a line from A to B, 
A being where the movement began and B where it stopped. 

This line has one dimension: 
length. 

Now move the line at a right 
angle to the movement of the 
original point and you get a 
plane. If the movement was,, as 
specified, at right angles and for 
the same distance as the length 



of the line, the figure will be a 
square. 

Now lift the square from the 
paper and move it vertically, 
again for the same distance, and 
you get a cube. 

So far, you had a visible, logical progression from dimensionless point to one-dimensional 
line, from there to the twodimensional plane, and from that 
to the three-dimensional solid. 

But when you move the solid 
through space, all you get is another solid of a different shape. 
Offhand, this seems to indicate 
that the number of dimensions 
stops with the third, but many 
people will feel like the philosopher Gustav Theodor Fechner 
who asked why Nature should be 
unable to count beyond three. 

If you ask for a little more 
information of what the fourth 
dimension should be, the mathematician is apt to hold up a box 
of any kind, point at one of its 
corners and say: 

"The corner of the box demonstrates the three dimensions of 
space — namely, length, width and 
height. As one can clearly see, 
these three dimensions are vertical to each other. The fourth dimension should be a line which 
is vertical to the other three — 
and don't think that the simple 
prolongation of any of the other 
three lines beyond the corner is 
the answer to the problem. 



68 




 



'You can't visualize such a 
fourth line? Of course not, because that would be the fourth 
dimension and our world is threedimensional. Hence it is impostible to visualize the fourth 
dimension, but we can treat it 
mathematically. Since we call the 
line a, the square is a- and the 
cube a 3 * and nothing prevents 
and nothing prevents us from 
writing a 4 and from giving a 
name to the four-dimensional 
super-solid thus described." 

Obviously, nothing prevents us 
from doing that, but neither the 
symbol a J nor the name tesseract 
proves or even indicates that 
there is something in reality 
which corresponds to this concept. 

"W/ELL, is there something else 
" which indicates the reality 
of the fourth dimension? Let's 
begin at the beginning again. 

Take a piece of ordinary writing paper (not a square) and cut 
it diagonally. You'll get two triangles, visibly congruent since 
their sides and their angles correspond. Place them on your 
table, both with the right angle 
to the left. You can make them 

*Answer to seven correspondents: yes, 
I do know that a cube has 8 vertices. 
My statement in reply to a letter that it 
has 4 is not due to ignorance nor has 
it, as two correspondents suspected, a 
"hidden and higher meaning." It was a 
simple typographical error. 



cover simply by moving them 
along the plane of the table top. 
But place them in such a way 
now that one has the right angle 
at the left and the other at the 
right. They can be made to cover 
only by turning one of them 
through the third dimension. 

To a two-dimensional being, 
this would be an impossible move 
and it was, quite some time ago, 
the theme of a book called Flatland by A. Square. Flatland has 
been quoted in early science fiction stories about as often as the 
name of Albert Einstein was 
thrown around. 

Now there are a number of 
three-dimensional bodies which 
seemed to be analogous to the 
two planes that would not match. 
It was Immanuel Kant who was 
the first to point out that our 
two hands are examples of such 
bodies. Your right glove will not 
fit your left hand, and your left 
shoe will not fit the right foot, 
even though they seem to be geometrically alike, having the same 
measurements in all three dimensions. But maybe they could be 
made to "cover" by "turning" 
them through the fourth dimension! 

Can they? I don't know — I 
can't even visualize it, naturally 
— I'm only a three-dimensional 
solid myself. 

Let's return to the two triangles 
where things are somewhat simp

ler. Since the lengths of all three 
sides correspond, and since all 
three angles are the same, they 
should be as congruent as anyone could wish. Our simple experiment proved, however, that 
they may or may not be congruent. 

What is wrong now? Simply 
this: a description in terms of 
sides and angles is an incomplete 
description. To make it complete, 
a description of arrangement has 
to be added. 

If you keep in mind that such 
an additional term should be included, you. can see clearly that 
the two triangles, when positioned in such a way that they fail to 
match, simply are not congruent. 
And the same goes for asy m metrical solid bodies, such as 
crystals. They may agree in all 
angles and dimensions, but if 
you have ( and here the language 
has supplied a very significant 
term) one right-hand crystal and 
one left-hand crystal, they can't 
match. To insist that they should 
merely means to insist on an incomplete description. * 

However, the fourth dimension 
has one more twist. A solid, in 
order to exist, has to have length, 
width, height . . . and duration. 
If it had no duration, it wouldn't 
exist. Hence there is a fourth dimension, but we have always 
used another name for it. We 
have called it time. Time, there


fore, should be considered the 
fourth dimension. 

But you don't have to consider 
it that way at all. 

MORE ABOUT PLUTO 

THE existence of a planet outside the orbit of Neptune was, 
as is rather well known, suspected 
since about 1900. The planet, 
Pluto, was finally found in 1930 
by Clyde Tombaugh, and it has 
been under what surveillance 
could be managed ever since. 

But we now know that Pluto 
could have been discovered in 
1919, for it was photographed 
twice during that year. The explanation is not, however, that 
astronomers overlooked it on 
these two plates. The fact is that 
they could not help but overlook 
it; two occurrences effectively hid 
the still unknown planet. 

On one of the two plates, the 
tiny image of the planet was 
neatly bisected by a hairline flaw 
in the plate. Such hairline flaws 
are rare, but when they do occur, 
astronomers recognize them at a 
glance. Naturally, the pinpoint of 
light, sitting so precisely on a 
hairline flaw, was taken to be a 
part of the flaw. 

On the other plate, the planet 
happened to be in line of sight 
with a small distant star. It was 
not precisely the line of sight, 
else it could not have been found 



70 




 



later, but almost so. The result 
was that a star image, known to 
belong in that spot, was finally 
elongated, though so faintly that 
it was not conspicuous. 

And that's why Pluto was not 
discovered until eleven years 
after it was photographed.

ANY QUESTIONS? 

What is the reason for all the 
planets being near the plane of 
the ecliptic? Why arerit some of 
them revolving around Sol vertically in comparison with the 
others? 

Pat Scholz 
9909 Fourth Avenue 
Brooklyn 9, N. Y. 
The reason why our solar 
system — and presumably all 
other solar systems, too — is so 
flat lies in the period before 
the formation of the planets. 

Let's assume that the Solar 
System began with a roughly 
spherical cloud of gas atoms 
and dust particles whicb Burrounded the Sun. We can also 
assume that this cloud rotated 
around the sun. 

Now the particles, molecules 
and atoms which moved in and 
near the equatorial plane of 
that cloud did not interfere 
with each other very much. But 
those which originally moved in 
other directions, crossing the 



equator from "above" and "below, 1 * ran into each other and 
into "equatorial particles" in 
time. If their movement was 
stopped completely by the collision, they simply fell into the 
Sun. Or, if their movement was 
not stopped completely they 
"fell in" with the equatorial 
motion. In either case, the number of particles moving at large 
angles to the "equator" was 
diminished. 

That took place before the 
planets themselves formed and 
continued while they were 
forming and even afterward. A 
few of the nonconformist particles may still be around, but 
not enough to Bee. 

If the gravitational pull of the 
Moon is responsible for the tides 
here on Earth, how would the 
tides be affected by two or more 
moons? How about a planet 
which has rings like Saturn, but 
no moon or moons? 

Jean De Grazia 
597 Hopkins St. 
Sewickly, Penna. 
Let's first get a clear mental 
picture of what the lideB are. 
Seen from space, they are a 
slight double mountain of 
water, one directly under the 
Moon, the other on the opposite Bide, both of which move 
around the Earth, inundating 
those portions of the shore

lines which are shallow enough 
to he inundated. 

In the case of a planet with* 
out a moon, but with a ring or 
rings, there would be a slight 
equatorial bulge all around 
which does not move. A rotating planet has such an equatorial bulge, anyway, because 
of its rotation, and the ring 
would slightly reenforce that 
bulge. Since this would be stationary, the planet would appear to have no tides. 

In the case of a planet with 
several large moons, the tidal 
picture would- he enormously 
complicated. Each moon would 
produce its double bulge and, 
since the various moons would 
revolve around the planet with 
various periods of revolution, 
so would the bulges. The high 
tide caused by moon A might 
increase the high tide of moon 
It, or else the low tide of moon 
A might cancel the high tide of 
moon B. 

If you had a fairly watery 
planet with four large moons, 
its inhabitants would develop 
astronomy to a high degree 
early in their history. 

Could you please explain the 
ether theory as applied to sound 
transmission? And what is the 
accepted figure for the speed of 



electromagnetic waves? 

E. A. Lackenbach 
53 Pine Avenue 
New Rochelle, N. Y. 
Sound waves are transmitted 
through the air, not through the 
(hypothetical) ether. As the 
air thins out with altitude, there 
comes a point where it ceases 
to be a continuous medium, 
and even though there are still 
molecules of oxygen, nitrogen 
and other gases around, sound 
is no longer transmitted. At 
present, this is thought to take 
place at about 40 miles above 
the Earth, but it may he much 
lower. 

The speed of sound depends 
only on the temperature of the 
air, not its density. At normal 
temperatures, it is about 760 
miles per hour. Physics textbook b need revision to bring 
them up to date on this point; 
they state that the speed is 660 
miles an hour at 25,000 feet, 
and ascribe it to density. In 
reality, the figures apply to the 
prevailing temperatures at 
those altitudes and not to the 
atmospheric densities. 

Electromagnetic waves of any 
wave length do not depend on 
air for transmission, and so 
they all travel at the same rate, 
which is roughly 186,000 miles 
per second, the speed of light.

WATCHBIRD 




Strange how often the Millenium has been at 
hand. The idea is peace on Earth, see, and 
the way to do it is by figuring out angles. 

Illustrated by EMSH 



WHEN Gelsen entered, he 
saw that the rest of 
the watchbird manufacturers were already present. 
There were six of them, not 
counting himself, and the room 
was blue with expensive cigar 
smoke. 

"Hi, Charlie," one of them 
called as he came in. 

The rest broke off conversation long enough to wave a casual greeting at him. As a 
watchbird manufacturer, he was 
a member manufacturer of salvation, he reminded himself wryly. 
Very exclusive. You must have a 



certified government contract if 
you want to save the human 
race. 

"The government representative isn't here yet," one of the 
men told him. "He's due any 
minute." 

"We're getting the green 
light," another said. 

"Fine." Gelsen found a chair 
near the door and looked around 
the room. It was like a convention, or a Boy Scout rally. The 
six men made up for their lack 
of numbers by sheer volume. The 
president of Southern Consolidated was talking at the top of his 



7S 



lungs about watchbird's enormous durability. The two presidents he was talking at were 
grinning, nodding, one trying to 
interrupt with the results of a 
test he had run on watchbird's 
resourcefulness, the other talking 
about the new recharging apparatus. 

The other three men were in 
their own little group, delivering 
what sounded like a panegyric 
to watchbird. 

Gelsen noticed that all of them 
stood straight and tall, like the 
saviors they felt they were. He 
didn't find it funny. Up to a few 
days ago he had felt that way 
himself. He had considered himself a pot-bellied, slightly balding saint. 

TIE sighed and lighted a cigarette. At the beginning of the 
project, he had been as enthusiastic as the others. He remembered saying to Macintyre, his 
chief engineer, "Mac, a new day 
is coming. Watchbird is the Answer." And Macintyre had nodded very profoundly — another 
watchbird convert. 

How wonderful it had seemed 
then! A simple, reliable answer 
to one of mankind's greatest 
problems, all wrapped and packaged in a pound of incorruptible 
metal, crystal and plastics. 

Perhaps that was the very reason he was doubting it now. Gel


sen suspected that you don't 
solve human problems so easily. 
There had to be a catch somewhere. 

After all, murder was an old 
problem, and watchbird too new 
a solution. 

"Gentlemen — " They had been 
talking so heatedly that they 
hadn't noticed the government 
representative entering. Now the 
room became quiet at once. 

"Gentlemen," the plump government man said, "the President, with the consent of 
Congress, has acted to form a 
watchbird division for every city 
and town in the country." 

The men burst into a spontaneous shout of triumph. They 
were going to have their chance 
to save the world after all, Gelsen 
thought, and worriedly asked 
himself what was wrong with 
that. 

He listened carefully as the 
government man outlined the 
distribution scheme. The country 
was to be divided into seven 
areas, each to be supplied and 
serviced by one manufacturer. 
This meant monopoly, of course, 
but a necessary one. Like the 
telephone service, it was in 
the public's best interests. You 
couldn't have competition in 
watchbird service. Watchbird 
was for everyone. 

"The President hopes," the 
representative continued, "that 



76 




 



full watchbird service will be installed in the shortest possible 
time. You will have top priorities 
on strategic metals, manpower, 
and so forth." 

"Speaking for myself," the 
president of Southern Consolidated said, "I expect to have the 
first batch of watchbirds distributed within the week. Production is all set up." 

r i^HE rest of the men were 
equally ready. The factories 
had been prepared to roll out 
the watchbirds for months now. 
The final standardized equipment had been agreed upon, and 
only the Presidential go-ahead 
had been lacking. 

"Fine," the representative said. 
"If that is all, I think we can — 
is there a question?" 

"Yes, sir," Gelsen said. "I 
want to know if the present model 
is the one we are going to manufacture." 

"Of course," the representative 
said. "It's the most advanced." 

"I have an objection." Gelsen 
stood up. His colleagues were 
glaring coldly at him. Obviously 
he was delaying the advent of 
the golden age. 

"What is your objection?" the 
representative asked. 

"First, let me say that I am 
one hundred per cent in favor of 
a machine to stop murder. It's 
been needed for a long time. I 



object only to the watchbird's 
learning circuits. They serve, in 
effect, to animate the machine 
and give it a pseudo -consciousness. I can't approve of that." 

"But, Mr. Gelsen, you yourself 
testified that the watchbird would 
not be completely efficient unless such circuits were introduced. 
Without them, the watchbirds 
could stop only an estimated 
seventy per cent of murders." 

"I know that," Gelsen said, 
feeling extremely uncomfortable. 
"I believe there might be a moral 
danger in allowing a machine to 
make decisions that are rightfully Man's," he declared doggedly. 

"Oh, come now, Gelsen," one 
of the corporation presidents said. 
"It's nothing of the sort. The 
watchbird will only reinforce the 
decisions made by honest men 
from the beginning of time." 

"I think that is true," the representative agreed. "But I can 
understand how Mr. Gelsen feels. 
It is sad that we must put a human problem into the hands of a 
machine, sadder still that we 
must have a machine enforce our 
laws. But I ask you to remember, 
Mr. Gelsen, that there is no 
other possible way of stopping a 
murderer before he strikes. It 
would be unfair to the many innocent people killed every year 
if we were to restrict watchbird 
on philosophical grounds, Don't 



WATCHBIR

you agree that I'm right?" 

"Yes, I suppose I do," Gelsen 
said unhappily. He had told himself all that a thousand times, 
but something still bothered him. 
Perhaps he would talk it over 
with Macintyre. 

As the conference broke up, a 
thought struck him. He grinned. 

A lot of policemen were going 
to be out of work! 

"1VTOW what do you think 
of that?" Officer Celtrics 
demanded. "Fifteen years in Homicide and a machine is replacing me." He wiped a large red 
hand across his forehead and 
leaned against the captain's desk. 
"Ain't science marvelous?" 

Two other policemen, late of 
Homicide, nodded glumly. 

. "Don't worry about it," the 
captain said. "We'll find a home 
for you in Larceny, Celtrics. 
You'll like it here." 

"I just can't get over it," Celtrics complained. "A lousy little 
piece of tin and glass is going 
to solve all the crimes." 

"Not quite," the captain said. 
"The watch birds are supposed 
to prevent the crimes before they 
happen." 

"Then how'll they be crimes?" 
one of the policeman asked. "I 
mean they can't hang you for 
murder until you commit one, 
can they?" 

"That's not the idea," the cap


tain said. "The watchbirds are 
supposed to stop a man before 
he commits a murder." 

"Then no one arrests him?" 
Celtrics asked. 

"I don't know how they're going to work that out," the captain admitted. 

The men were silent for a 
while. The captain yawned and 
examined his watch. 

"The thing I don't understand," Celtrics said, still leaning on the captain's desk, "is just 
how do they do it? How did it 
start, Captain?" 

HpHE captain studied Celtrics' 
face for possible irony; after 
all, watchbird had been in the 
papers for months. But then he 
remembered that Celtrics, like 
his sidekicks, rarely bothered to 
turn past the sports pages. 

"Well," the captain said, trying to remember what he , had 
read in the Sunday supplements, 
"these scientists were working on 
criminology. They were studying 
murderers, to find out what made 
them tick. So they found that 
murderers throw out a different 
sort of brain wave from ordinary 
people. And their glands act 
funny, too. All this happens 
when they're about to commit a 
murder. So these scientists worked out a special machine to flash 
red or something when these 
brain waves turned on." 



78 




 



"Scientists," Celtrics said bitterly. 

"Well, after the scientists had 
this machine, they didn't know 
what to do with it. It was too 
big to move around, and murderers didn't drop in often enough 
to make it flash. So they built it 
into a smaller unit and tried it 
out in a few police stations. I 
think they tried one upstate. But 
it didn't work so good. You 
couldn't get to the crime in time. 
That's why they built the watchbirds." 

"I don't think they'll stop no 
criminals," one of the policemen 
insisted. 

"They sure will. I read the 
test results. They can smell him 
out before he commits a crime. 
And when they reach him, they 
give him a powerful shock or 
something. It'll stop him." 

"You closing up Homicide, 
Captain?" Celtrics asked. 

"Nope," the captain said. "I'm 
leaving a skeleton crew in until 
we see how these birds do." 

"Hah," Celtrics said. "Skeleton 
crew. That's funny." 

"Sure," the captain said. "Anyhow, I'm going to leave some men 
on. It seems the birds don't stop 
all murders." 

"Why not?" 

"Some murderers don't have 
these brain waves," the captain 
answered, trying to remember 
what the newspaper article had 



said. "Or their glands don't work 
or something." 

"Which ones don't they stop?" 
Celtrics asked, with professional 
curiosity. 

"I don't know. But I hear they 
got the damned things fixed so 
they're going to stop all of them 
soon." 

"How they working that?" 
"They learn. The watchbirds, 
I mean. Just like people." 
"You kidding me?" 
"Nope." 

"Well," Celtrics said, "I think 
I'll just keep old Betsy oiled, 
just in case. You can't trust these 
scientists." 

"Right." 

"Birds!" Celtrics scoffed. 

/~|VER the town, the watchbird 
soared in a long, lazy curve. 
Its aluminum hide glistened in 
the morning sun, and dots of 
light danced on its stiff wings: 
Silently it flew. 

Silently, but with all senses 
functioning. Built-in kinesthetics 
told the watchbird where it was, 
and held it in a long search curve. 
Its eyes and ears operated as one 
unit, searching, seeking. 

And then something happened! 
The watchbird's electronically 
fast reflexes picked up the edge 
of a sensation. A correlation center tested it, matching it with 
electrical and chemical data in 
its memory files. A relay tripped. 



WATCHBIRD 



79 



Down the watchbird spiraled, 
coming in on the increasingly 
strong sensation. It smelted the 
outpouring of certain glands, 
tasted a deviant brain wave. 

Fully alerted and armed, it 
spun and banked in the bright 
morning sunlight. 

'Dinelli was so intent he didn't 
see the watchbird coming. He 
had his gun poised, and his eyes 
pleaded with the big grocer. 

"Don't come no closer." 

"You lousy little punk," the 
grocer said, and took another 
step forward. "Rob me? I'll break 
every bone in your puny body." 

The grocer, too stupid or too 
courageous to understand the 
threat of the gun, advanced on 
the little thief. 

"All right," Dinelli said, in a 
thorough state of panic. "All 
right, sucker, take — " 

A bolt of electricity knocked 
him on his back. The gun went 
off, smashing a breakfast food 
display. 

"What in hell?" the grocer 
asked, staring at the stunned 
thief. And then he saw a flash 
of silver wings. "Well, I'm really 
damned. Those watchbirds work !" 

He stared until the wings disappeared in the sky. Then he 
telephoned the police. 

The watchbird returned to his 
search curve. His thinking center 
correlated the new facts he had 
learned about murder. Several of 



these he hadn't known before. 

This new information was simultaneously flashed to all the 
other watchbirds and their information was flashed back to 
him. 

New information, methods, definitions were constantly passing 
between them. 

lVTOW that the watchbirds were 
' rolling off the assembly line 
in a steady stream, Gelsen allowed himself to relax. A loud 
contented hum filled his plant. 
Orders were being filled on time, 
with top priorities given to the 
biggest cities in his area, and 
working down to the smallest 
towns. 

"All smooth, Chief," Macintyre 
said, coming in the door. He had 
just completed a routine inspection. 

"Fine. Have a seat." 

The big engineer sat down and 
lighted a cigarette. 

"We've been working on this 
for some time," Gelsen said, when 
he couldn't think of anything 
else. 

"We sure have," Macintyre 
agreed. He leaned back and inhaled deeply. He had been one 
of the consulting engineers on 
the original watchbird. That was 
six years back. He had been 
working for Gelsen ever since, 
and the men had become good 
friends. 



80 




 



"The thing I wanted to ask 
you was this — " Gelsen paused. 
He couldn't think how to phrase 
what he wanted. Instead he asked, "What do you think of the 
watchbirds, Mac?" 

"Who, me?"- The engineer 
grinned nervously. He had been 
eating, drinking and sleeping 
watchbird ever since its inception. He had never found it necessary to have an attitude. "Why, 
I think it's great." 

"I don't mean that," Gelsen 
said. He realized that what he 
wanted was to have someone understand his point of view. "I 
mean do you figure there might 
be some danger in machine 
thinking?" 

"I don't think so, Chief. Why 
do you ask?" 

"Look, I'm no scientist or engineer. I've just handled cost and 
production and let you - boys 
worry about how. But as a layman, watchbird is starting to 
frighten me." 

"No reason for that." 

"I don'c like the idea of the 
learning circuits." 

"But why not?" Then Macintyre grinned again. "I know. 
You're like a lot of people, Chief 
— afraid your machines are going 
to wake up and say, 'What are 
we doing here? Let's go out and 
rule the world.' Is that it?" 

"Maybe something like that," 
Gelsen admitted. 



"No chance of it," Macintyre 
said. "The watchbirds are complex, I'll admit, but an M.I.T. 
calculator is a whole lot more 
complex. And it hasn't got consciousness." 

"No. But the watchbirds can 
/earn." 

"Sure. So can all the new calculators. Do you think they'll 
team up with the watchbirds?" 

GELSEN felt annoyed at Macintyre, and even more annoyed at himself for being ridiculous. "It's a fact that the 
watchbirds can put their learning 
into action. No one is monitoring 
them." 

"So that's the trouble," Macintyre said. 

"I've been thinking of getting 
out of watchbird." Gelsen hadn't 
realized it until that moment. 

"Look, Chief," Macintyre said. 
"Will you take an engineer's word 
on this?" 

"Let's hear it." 

"The watchbirds are no more 
dangerous than an automobile, 
an IBM calculator or a thermometer. They have no more consciousness or volition than those 
things. The watchbirds are built 
to respond to certain stimuli, and 
to carry out certain operations 
when they receive that stimuli." 

"And the learning circuits?" 

"You have to have those," 
Macintyre said patiently, as 



WATCHBIRD 



though explaining the whole 
thing to a ten-year-old. "The 
purpose of the watchbird is to 
frustrate all murder -attempts, 
right? Well, only certain murderers give out these stimuli. In 
order to stop all of them, the 
watchbird has to search out new 
definitions of murder and correlate them with what it already 
knows." 

"I think it's inhuman," Gelsen 
said. 

"That's the best thing about 
it.- The watchbirds are unemotional. Their reasoning is nonanthropomorphic. You can't 
bribe them or drug them. You 
shouldn't fear them, either." 

The intercom on Gelsen's desk 
buzzed. He ignored it. 

"I know all this," Gelsen said. 
"But, still, sometimes I feel like 
the man who invented dynamite. 
He thought it would only be 
used for blowing up tree stumps." 

"You didn't invent watchbird." 

"I still feel morally responsible 
because I manufacture them." 

The intercom buzzed again, 
and Gelsen irritably punched a 
button. 

"The reports are in on the first 
week of watchbird operation," 
his secretary told him. 

"How do they look?" 

"Wonderful, sir." 

"Send them in in fifteen minutes." Gelsen switched the intercom off and turned back to 



Macintyre, who was cleaning his 
fingernails with a wooden match. 
"Don't you think that this represents a trend in human thinking? 
The mechanical god? The electronic father?" 

"Chief," Macintyre said, "I 
think you should study watchbird 
more closely. Do you know 
what's built into the circuits?" 

"Only generally." 

"First, there is a purpose. 
Which is to stop living organisms 
from committing murder. Two, 
murder may be defined as an 
act of violence, consisting of 
breaking, mangling, maltreating 
or otherwise stopping the functions of a living organism by a 
living organism. Three, most 
murderers are detectable by certain chemical and electrical 
changes." 

Macintyre paused to light another cigarette. "Those conditions 
take care of the routine f unc tions. Then, for the learning 
circuits, there are two more 
conditions. Four, there are some 
living organisms who commit 
murder without the signs mentioned in three. Five, these can be 
detected by data applicable to 
condition two." 

"I see," Gelsen said. 

"You realize how foolproof it 
is?" 

"I suppose so." Gelsen hesitated a moment. "I guess that's 
all." 



82 




 



"Right," the engineer said, and 
left. 

Gelsen thought for a few moments. There couldn't be anything wrong with the watchbirds. 

"Send in the reports," he said 
into the intercom. 

TTIGH above the lighted buildH ings of the city, the watchbird soared. It was dark, but in 
the distance the watchbird could 
see another, and another beyond 
that. For this was a large city. 

To prevent murder . . . 

There was more to watch for 
now. New information had 
crossed the invisible network that 
connected all watchbirds. New 
data, new ways of detecting the 
violence of murder. 

There! The edge of a sensation! Two watchbirds dipped simultaneously. One had received 
the scent a fraction of a second 
before the other. He continued 
down while the other resumed 
monitoring. 

Condition four, there are some 
living organisms who commit 
murder without the signs mentioned in condition three. 

Through his new information, 
the watchbird knew by extrapolation that this organism was 
bent on murder, even though the 
characteristic chemical and electrical smells were absent. 

The watchbird, all senses 
acute, closed in on the organism. 



He found what he wanted, and 
dived. 

Roger Greco leaned against a 
building, his hands in his pockets. 
In his left hand was the cool butt 
of a .45. Greco waited patiently. 

He wasn't thinking of anything 
in particular, just relaxing against 
a building, waiting for a man. 
Greco didn't know why the man 
was to be killed. He didn't care. 
Greco's lack of curiosity was part 
of his value. The other part was 
his skill. 

One bullet, neatly placed in 
the head of a man he didn't 
know. It didn't excite him or 
sicken him. It was a job, just like 
anything else. You killed a man. 
So? 

As Greco's victim stepped out 
of a building, Greco lifted the 
.45 out of his pocket. He released 
the safety and braced the gun 
with his right hand. He still 
wasn't thinking of anything as 
he took aim . . . 

And was knocked off his feet. 

Greco thought he had been 
shot. He struggled up again, 
looked around, and sighted foggily on his victim. 

Again he was knocked down. 

This time he lay on the ground, 
trying to draw a bead. He never 
thought of stopping, for Greco 
was a craftsman. 

With the next blow, everything 
went black. Permanently, because the watchbird's duty was 



WATCH BIRD 



83 



to protect the object of violence 
— at whatever cost to the murderer. 

The victim walked to his car. 
He hadn't noticed anything unusual. Everything had happened 
in silence. 

GELSEN was feeling pretty 
good. The watchbirds had 
been operating perfectly. Crimes 
of violence had been cut in half, 
and cut again. Dark alleys were 
no longer mouths of horror. 
Parks and playgrounds were not 
places to shun after dusk. 

Of course, there were still rob


beries. Petty thievery flourished, 
and embezzlement, larceny, forgery and a hundred other crimes. 

But that wasn't so important. 
You could regain lost money — 
never a lost life. 

Gelsen was ready to admit that 
he had been wrong about the 
watchbirds. They were doing a 
job that humans had been unable to accomplish. 

The first hint of something 
wrong came that morning. 

Macintyre came into his office. 
He stood silently in front of 
Gelsen's desk, looking annoyed 
and a little embarrassed. 




84 




 



"What's the matter, Mac?" 
Gelsen asked. 

"One of the watchbirds went 
to work on a slaughterhouse man. 
Knocked him out." 

Gelsen thought about it for a 
moment. Yes, the watchbirds 
would do that. With their new 
learning circuits, they had probably defined the killing of animals as murder. 

"Tell the packers to mechanize their slaughtering," Gelsen 
said. "I never liked that business 
myself." 

"All right," Macintyre said. 
He pursed his lips, then shrugged 
his shoulders and left. 

Gelsen stood beside his desk, 
thinking. Couldn't the watchbirds differentiate between a 
murderer and a man engaged in 
a legitimate profession? No, evidently not. To them, murder was 
murder. No exceptions. He 
frowned. That might take a little 




ironing out in the circuits. 

But not too much, he decided 
hastily. Just make them a little 
more discriminating. 

He sat down again and buried 
himself in paperwork, trying to 
avoid the edge of an old fear. 

f~|"iHEY strapped the prisoner 
into the chair and fitted the 




WATCHBIRD 



85 



electrode to his leg. 

"Oh, oh," he moaned, only 
half-conscious now of what they 
were doing. 

They fitted the helmet over his 
shaved head and tightened the 
last straps. He continued to moan 
softly. 

And then the watchbird swept 
in. How he had come, no one 
knew. Pri sons are large and 
strong, with many locked doors, 
but the watchbird was there — 

To stop a murder. 

"Get that thing out of here!" 
the warden shouted, and reached 
for the switch. The watchbird 
knocked him down. 

"Stop that!" a guard screamed, 
and grabbed for the switch himself. He was knocked to the floor 
beside the warden. 

"This isn't murder, you idiot!" 
another guard said. He drew his 
gun to shoot down the glittering, 
wheeling metal bird. 

Anticipating, the watchbird 
smashed him back against the 
wall. 

There was silence in the room. 
After a while, the man in the 
helmet started to giggle. Then 
he stopped. 

The watchbird stood on guard, 
fluttering in mid-air — 

Making sure no murder was 
done. 

New data flashed along the 
watchbird network. Unmonitored, independent, the thousands 



of watchbirds received and acted 
upon it. 

The breaking, mangling or 
otherwise stopping the functions 
of a living organism by a living 
organism. New acts to stop. 

"Damn you, git going!" Farmer 
Ollister shouted, and raised his 
whip again. The horse balked, 
and the wagon rattled and shook 
at he edged sideways. 

"You lousy hunk of pigmeal, 
git going!" the farmer yelled and 
he raised the whip again. 

It never fell. An alert watchbird, sensing violence, had knocked him out of his seat. 

A living organism? What is a 
living organism? The watchbirds 
extended their definitions as they 
became aware of more facts. And, 
of course, this gave them more 
work. 

The deer was just visible at the 
edge of the woods. The hunter 
raised his rifle, and took careful 
aim. 

He didn't have time to shoot. 

WITH his free hand, Gelsen 
mopped perspiration from 
his face. "All right," he said into 
the telephone. He listened to the 
stream of vituperation from the 
other end, then placed the receiver gently in its cradle. 

"What was that one?" Macintyre asked. He was unshaven, tie 
loose, shirt unbuttoned. 

"Another fisherman," Gelsen 



86 




 



said. "It seems the watchbirds 
won't let him fish even though 
his family is starving. What are 
we going to do about it, he wants 
to know." 

"How many hundred is that?" 

"I don't know. I haven't opened the mail." 

"Well, I figured out where the 
trouble is," Macintyre said 
gloomily, with the air of a man 
who knows just how he blew up 
the Earth — after it was too late. 

"Let's hear it." 

"Everybody took it for granted 
that we wanted all murder 
stopped. We figured the watchbirds would think as we do. We 
ought to have qualified the conditions." 

"I've got an idea," Gelsen 
said, "that we'd have to know 
just why and what murder is, 
before we could qualify the conditions properly. And if we knew 
that, we wouldn't need the watchbirds." 

"Oh, I don't know about that. 
They just have to be told that 
some things which look like murder are not murder." 

"But why should they stop 
fisherman?" Gelsen asked. 
' "Why shouldn't they? Fish and 
animals are living organisms. We 
just don't think that killing them 
is murder." 

The telephone rang. Gelsen 
glared at it and punched the intercom. "I told you no more 



calls, no matter what." 

"This is from Washington," 
his secretary said. ' 'I thought 
you'd — " 

"Sorry." Gelsen picked up the 
telephone. "Yes. Certainly is a 
mess . . . Have they? All right, I 
certainly will." He put down the 
telephone. 

• "Short and sweet," he told 
Macintyre. "We're to shut down 
temporarily." 

"That won't be so easy," Macintyre said. "The watchbirds 
operate independent of any central control, you know. They 
come back once a week for a 
repair checkup. We'll have to 
turn them off then, one by one." 

"Well, let's get to it. Monroe 
over on the Coast has shut down 
about a quarter of his birds." 

"I think I can dope out a restricting circuit," Macintyre said. 

"Fine," Gelsen replied bitterly. 
"You make me very happy." 

' i^HE watchbirds were learning 
rapidly, expanding and adding 
to their knowledge. Loosely defined abstractions were extended, 
acted upon and re-extended. 

To stop murder . . . 

Metal and electrons reason 
well, but not in a human fashion. 

A living organism? Any living 
organism ! 

The watchbirds set themselves 
the task of protecting all living 
things. 



WATCHBIRD 



87 



The fly buzzed around the 
room, lighting on a table top, 
pausing a moment, then darting 
to a window sill. 

The old man stalked it, a rolled 
newspaper in his hand. 

Murderer ! 

The watchbirds swept down 
and saved the fly in the nick of 
time. » 

The old man writhed on the 
floor a minute and then was silent. He had been given only a 
mild shock, but it had been 
enough for his fluttery, cranky 
heart. 

His victim had been saved, 
though, and this was the important thing. Save the victim and 
give the aggressor his just desserts. 

ELSEN demanded angrily. 
"Why aren't they being 
turned off!" 

The assistant control engineer 
gestured. In a corner of the repair room lay the senior control 
engineer. He was just regaining 
consciousness. 

"He tried to turn one of them 
off," the assistant engineer said. 
Both his hands were knotted together. He was making a visible 
effort not to shake. 

"That's ridiculous. They 
haven't got any sense of selfpreservation." 

"Then turn them off yourself. 
Besides, I don't think any more 



are going to come." 

What could have happened? 
Gelsen began to piece it together. 
The watchbirds still hadn't decided on the limits of a living 
organism. When some of them 
were turned off in the Monroe 
plant, the rest must have correlated the data. 

So they had been forced to 
assume that they were living 
organisms, as well. 

No one had ever told them 
otherwise. Certainly they carried 
on most of the functions of living organisms. 

Then the old fears hit him. 
Gelsen trembled and hurried out 
of the repair room. He wanted 
to find Macintyre in a hurry. 

rw^HE nurse handed the surgeon the sponge. 
"Scalpel." 

She placed it in his hand. He 
started to make the first incision. 
And then he was aware of a disturbance. 

"Who let that thing in?" 

"I don't know," the nurse said, 
her voice muffled by the mask. 

"Get it out of here." 

The nurse waved her arms at 
the bright winged thing, but it 
fluttered over her head. 

The surgeon proceeded with 
the incision — as long as he was 
able. 

The watchbird drove him away 
and stood guard. 



88 




 



"Telephone the watchbird 
company!" the surgeon ordered. 
"Get them to turn the thing off." 

The watchbird was preventing 
violence to a living organism. 

The surgeon stood by helplessly while his patient died. 

FLUTTERING high above the 
network of highways, the 
watchbird watched and waited. 
It had been constantly working 
for weeks now, without rest or 
repair. Rest and repair were impossible, because the watchbird 
couldn't allow itself-— a living organism — to be murdered. And 
that was what happened" when 
watchbirds returned to the factory. 

There was a built-in order to 
return, after the lapse of a certain time period. But the watchbird had a stronger order to obey 
— preservation of life, including 
its own. 

The definitions of murder 
were almost infinitely extended 
now, impossible to cope with. 
But the watchbird didn't consider 
that. It responded to its stimuli, 
whenever they came and whatever their source. 

There was a new definition of 
living organism in its memory 
files. It had come as a result of 
the watchbird discovery that 
watchbirds were living organisms. 
And it had enormous ramifications. 



The stimuli came! For the 
hundredth time that day, the bird 
wheeled and banked, dropping 
swiftly down to stop murder. 

Jackson yawned and pulled his 
car to a shoulder of the road. 
He didn't notice the glittering 
dot in the sky. There was no reason for him to. Jackson wasn't 
contemplating murder, by any 
human definition. 

This was a good spot for a 
nap, he decided. He had been 
driving for seven straight hours 
and his eyes were starting to fog. 
He reached out to turn off the 
ignition key — 

And was knocked back against 
the side of the car. 

"What in hell's wrong with 
you?" he asked indignantly. "All 
I want to do is — " He reached 
for the key again, and again he 
was smacked back. 

Jackson knew better than to 
try a third time. He had been 
listening to the radio and he knew 
what the watchbirds did to stubborn violators. 

"You mechanical jerk," he 
said to the waiting metal bird. 
"A car's not alive. I'm not trying 
to kill it." 

But the watchbird only knew 
that a certain operation resulted 
in stopping an organism. The car 
was certainly a functioning organism. Wasn't it of metal, as 
were the watchbirds? Didn't it 
run?

Tt/|ACINTYRE said, "Without 
1TJ. repairs they'll run down." 
He shoved a pile of specification 
sheets out of his way. 

"How soon?" Gelsen asked. 

"Six months to a year. Say a 
year, barring accidents." 

"A year," Gelsen said. "In the 
meantime, everything is stopping; 
dead. Do you know the latest?" 

"What?" 

"The watchbirds have decided 
that the Earth is a living organism. They won't allow farmers 
to break ground for plowing. 
And, of course, everything else is 
a living organism — rabbits, beetles, flies, wolves, mosquitoes, 
lions, crocodiles, crows, and smaller forms of life such as bacteria." 

"I know," Macintrye said. 

"And you tell me they'll wear 
out in six months or a year. What 
happens now? What are we going to eat in six months?" 

The engineer rubbed his chin. 
"We'll have to do something 
quick and fast. Ecological balance is gone to hell." 

"Fast isn't the word. Instantaneously would be better." Gelsen lighted his thirty-fifth 
cigarette for the day. "At least I 
have the bitter satisfaction of 
saying, 'I told you so.' Although 
I'm just as responsible as the 
rest of the machine-worshipping 
fools." 

Macintyre wasn't listening. He 
was thinking about watchbirds. 



"Like the rabbit plague in Australia." 

"The death rate is mounting," 
Gelsen said. "Famine. Floods. 
Can't cut down trees. Doctors 
can't — what was that you said 
said about Australia?" 

"The rabbits," Macintyre repeated. "Hardly any left in Australia now." 

"Why? How was it done?" 

"Oh, found some kind of germ 
that attacked only rabbits. I 
think it was propagated by mosquitos — " 

"Work on that," Gelsen said. 
"You might have something. I 
want you to get on the telephone, 
ask for an emergency hookup 
with the engineers of the other 
companies. Hurry it up. Together 
you may be able to dope out 
something." 

"Right," Macintyre said. He 
grabbed a handful of blank paper 
and hurried to the telephone. 

WHAT did I tell you?" Officer Celtrics said. He 
grinned at the captain. "Didn't I 
tell you scientists were nuts?" 

"I didn't say you were wrong, 
did I?" the captain asked. 
"No, but you weren't sure." 
"Well, I'm sure now. You'd 
better get going. There's plenty 
of work for you." 

"I know." Celtrics drew his 
revolver from its holster, checked 
it and put it back. "Are all the 



90 




 



boys back, Captain?" 

"All?" the captain laughed humorlessly. "Homicide has increased by fifty per cent. There's 
m ore m u rd er now than there's 
ever been." 

"Sure," Celtrics said. "The 
watchbirds are too busy guarding cars and slugging spiders." 
He started toward the door, then 
turned for a parting shot. 

"Take my word. Captain. Machines are stupid." 

The captain nodded. 

rpHOUSANDS of watchbirds, 
trying to stop countless millions of murders — a hopeless 
task. But the watchbirds didn't 
hope. Without consciousness, they 
experienced no sense of accomplishment, no fear of failure. Patiently they went about their 
jobs, obeying each stimulus as it 
came. 

They couldn't be everywhere 
at the same time, but it wasn't 
necessary to be- People learned 
quickly what the watchbirds 
didn't like and refrained from doing it. It just wasn't safe. With 
their high speed and superfast 
senses, the watchbirds got around 
quickly. 

And now they meant business. 
In their original directives there 
had been a provision made for 
killing a murderer, if all other 
means failed. 

Why spare a murderer? 



It backfired. The watchbirds 
extracted the fact that murder 
and crimes of violence had increased geometrically since they 
had begun operation. This was 
true, because their new definitions 
increased the possibilities of murder. But to the watchbirds, the 
rise showed that the first methods 
had failed. 

Simple logic. If A doesn't work, 
try B. The watchbirds shocked 
to kill. 

Slaughterhouses in Chicago 
stopped and cattle starved to 
death in their pens, because 
farmers in the Midwest couldn't 
cut hay or harvest grain. 

No one had told the watchbirds 
that all life depends on carefully 
balanced murders. 

Starvation didn't concern the 
watchbirds, since it was an act 
of omission. 

Their interest lay only in acts 
of commission. 

Hunters sat home, glaring at 
the silver dots in the sky, longing to shoot them down. But for 
the most part, they didn't try. 
The watchbirds were quick to 
sense the murder intent and to 
punish it. 

Fishing boats swung idle at 
their moorings in San Pedro and 
Gloucester. Fish were living organisms. 

Farmers cursed and spat and 
died, trying to harvest the crop. 
Grain was alive and thus worthy 



WATCHBIRD 



91 



of protection. Potatoes were as 
important to the watchbird as 
any other living organism. The 
death of a blade of grass was 
equal to the assassination of a 
President— 

To the watchbirds. 

And, of course, certain machines were living. This followed, 
since the watchbirds were machines and living. 

God help you if you maltreated 
your radio. Turning it off meant 
killing it. Obviously — its voice 
was silenced, the red glow of its 
tubes faded, it grew cold. 

The watchbirds tried to guard 
their other charges. Wolves were 
slaughtered, trying to kill rabbits. Rabbits were electrocuted, 
trying to eat vegetables. Creepers 
were burned out in the act of 
strangling trees. 

A butterfly was executed, 
caught in the act of outraging a 
rose. 

This control was spasmodic, 
because of the fewness of the 
watchbirds. A billion watchbirds 
couldn't have carried out the ambitious project set by the thousands. 

The effect was of a murderous 
force, ten thousand bolts of irrational lightning raging around the 
country, striking a thousand 
times a day. 

Lightning which anticipated 
your moves and punished your 
intentions. 



GENTLEMEN, please," the 
government represents dve 
begged. "We must hurry." 

The seven manufacturers stopped talking. 

"Before we begin this meeting 
formally," the president of Monroe said, "I want to say something. We do not feel ourselves 
responsible for this unhappy 
state of affairs. It was a government project; the government 
must accept the responsibility, 
both moral and financial." 

Gelsen shrugged his shoulders. 
It was hard to believe that these 
men, just a few weeks ago, had 
been willing to accept the glory 
of saving the world. Now they 
wanted to shrug off the responsibility when the salvation went 
amiss. 

"I'm positive that that need 
not concern us now," the representative assured him. "We must 
hurry. You engineers have done 
an excellent job. 1 am proud of 
the cooperation you have shown 
in this emergency. You are hereby empowered to put the outlined plan into action." 

"Wait a minute," Gelsen said. 

"There is no time." 

"The plan's no good." 

"Don't you think it will work?" 

"Of course it will work. But 
I'm afraid the cure will be worse 
than the disease." 

The manufacturers looked as 
though they would have enjoyed 



92 




 



throttling Gelsen. He didn't hesitate. 

"Haven't we learned yet?" he 
asked. "Don't you see that you 
can't cure human problems by 
mechanization?" 

"Mr. Gelsen," the president of 
Monroe said, "I would enjoy 
hearing you philosophize, but, unfortunately, people are being 
killed. Crops are being ruined. 
There is famine in some sections 
of the country already. The 
watchbirds must be stopped at 
once!" 

"Murder must be stopped, too. 
I remember all of us agreeing 
upon that. But this is not the 
way!" 

"What would you suggest?" 
the representative asked. 

GELSEN took a deep breath. 
What he was about to say 
took all the courage he had. 

"Let the watchbirds run down 
by themselves," Gelsen suggested. 

There was a near-riot. The 
government representative broke 
it up. 

"Let's take our lesson," Gelsen urged, "admit that we were 
wrong trying to cure human 
problems by mechanical means. 
Start again. Use machines, yes, 
but not as judges and teachers 
and fathers." 

"Ridiculous," the representative said coldly. "Mr. Gelsen, 
you are overwrought. I suggest 



you control yourself." He cleared 
his throat. "All of you are ordered by the President to carry 
out the plan you have submitted." 
He looked sharply at Gelsen. 
"Not to do so will be treason." 

"I'll cooperate to the best of 
my ability," Gelsen said. 

"Good. Those assembly lines 
must be rolling within the week." 

Gelsen walked out of the room 
alone. Now he was confused 
again. Had he been right or was 
he just another visionary? Certainly, he hadn't explained himself with much clarity. 

Did he know what he meant? 

Gelsen cursed under his breath. 
He wondered why he couldn't 
ever be sure of anything. Weren't 
there any values he could hold 
on to? 

He hurried to the airport and 
to his plant. 

fTHE watchbird was operating 
-■- erratically now. Many of its 
delicate parts were out of line, 
worn by almost continuous operation. But gallantly it responded 
when the stimuli came. 

A spider was attacking a fly. 
The watchbird swooped down 
to the rescue. 

Simultaneously, it became 
aware of something overhead. 
The watchbird wheeled to meet 
it. 

There was a sharp crackle and 
a power bolt whizzed by the 



WATCHBIRD 



93 




watchbird's wing. Angrily, it 
spat a shock wave. 

The attacker was heavily insulated. Again it spat at the watchbird. This time, a bolt smashed 
through a wing. The watchbird 
darted away, but the attacker 
went after it in a burst of speed, 
throwing out more crackling 
power. 

The watchbird fell, but managed to send out its message. 
Urgent! A new menace to living 
organisms and this was the deadliest yet! 

Other watchbirds around the 
country integrated the message. 
Their thinking centers searched 
for an answer. 

"W/'ELL, Chief, they bagged 
fifty today," Macintyre 
said, coming into Gelsen's office. 

"Fine," Gelsen said, not looking at the engineer. 

"Not so fine." Macintyre sat 
down. "Lord, I'm tired! It was 



seventy-two yesterday." 

"I know." On Gelsen's desk 
were several dozen lawsuits, 
which he was sending to the government with a prayer. 

"They'll pick up again, 
though," Macintyre said confidently. "The Hawks are especially built to hunt down watchbirds. 
They're stronger, faster, and 
they've got better armor. We really rolled them out in a hurry, 
huh?" 

"We sure did." 

"The watchbirds are pretty 
good, too," Macintyre had to 
admit. "They're learning to take 
cover. They're trying a lot of 
stunts. You know, each one that 
goes down tells the others something." 

Gelsen didn't answer. 

"But anything the watchbirds 
can do, the Hawks can do better," Macintyre said cheerfully. 
"The Hawks have special learning circuits for hunting. They're 



94 




 



more flexible than the watchbirds. 
They learn faster." 

Gelsen gloomily stood up, 
stretched, and walked to the window. The sky was blank. Looking out, he realized that his 
uncertainties were over. Right or 
wrong, he had made up his mind. 

"Tell me," he said, still watching the sky, "what will the 
Hawks hunt after they get all the 
watchbirds?" 

"Huh?" Macintyre said. 
"Why—" 

"Just to be on the safe side, 
you'd better design something to 
hunt down the Hawks. .Tust in 
case, I mean." 

"You think — " 




"All I know is that the Hawks 
are self-controlled. So were the 
watchbirds. Remote control 
would have been too slow, the 
argument went on. The idea was 
to get the watchbirds and get 
them fast. That meant no restricting circuits." 

"We can dope something out," 
Macintyre said uncertainly. 

"You've got an aggressive machine up in the air now. A murder machine. Before that it was 
an anti-murder machine. Your 
next gadget will have to be even 
more self-sufficient, won't it?" 

Macintyre didn't answer. 

"I don't hold you responsible," 
Gelsen said. "It's me. It's everyone." 

In the air outside was a swiftmoving dot. 

"That's what comes," said Gelsen, "of giving a machine the 
job that was our own responsibility." 

|~WVERHEAD, a Hawk was 
zeroing in on a watchbird. 

The armored murder machine 
had learned a lot in a few days. 
Its sole function was to kill. At 
present it was impelled toward a 
certain type of living organism, 
metallic like itself. 

But the Hawk had just discovered that there were other 
types of living organisms, too — 

Which had to be murdered.

GALAXY'S 

5 Star Shelf 



PLAYER PIANO by Kurt Vonnegut, Jr. Charles Scribner's 
Sons, New York, 1952, 296 pages, 
$3.00 

HERE is a sharp-pointed 
weapon — a biting, vividly 
alive and very effectively understated anti-Utopia. It deals with 
the cybernetic future of the 
U.S.A., a future in which all jobs 
of repetitive or patternable nature have been eliminated, and 
the workers have been replaced 
by self-operating machines. 

This is not primarily a novel 
of revolt against the machine, 
however; it deals only glancingly 
with the fate of the disemployed. 



What it does is examine the mores 
and miseries of the managerialengineering group that has become the nation's leaders, its 
elites. 

The author takes one man, Dr. * 
Paul Proteus, son of the first national technological dictator and 
(at first without knowing it) a 
rebel, and studies his decline and 
fall. In the process. Vonnegut 
reviews with bright venom the 
apotheoses of advertising, Chamber of Commercism, joinerism, 
and vulgarity that the new society has arrived at, with particular emphasis on the moral 
climate of the time. This involves , fanatical emphasis on 



96 




 



loyalty to the machine itself. 

The greatest crime of the society is sabotage of the machine 
— not murder of the human being; for this is the level to which 
the thinking of the elites in this 
disturbing and highly entertaining book has arrived. 

But Vonnegut gives the "people" their part of the stage, too. 
Most of them are either in the 
armed forces or the "Wrecks and 
Reeks" — Reconstruction and 
Reclamation Corps, the WPAPWA of the future. Some are still 
trying to make do as bartenders, 
gamblers, and members of other 
ancient "fringe" professions such 
as hotel-keeping and whatnot. 
And all are completely demoralized, defeated, decadent. 

They are given practically 
everything they want in the way 
of mechanical equipment (one 
must maintain markets and keep 
the machines rolling, mustn't 
one?) but they have lost their 
reason for being, their independence. 

Throughout the book, as a 
sort of Zadigan counterpoint, we 
keep meeting the Shah of Bratpuhr, touring America under the 
aegis of the State Department, 
who cannot be dissuaded from 
his contended analysis of the 
lower classes (90 per cent of the 
people) as takaru; i.e., slaves. 

For readers who think well of 
the chances of individual man 



under a cybernetic economy, this 
book will have a very, very nasty 
flavor. Which is why wc others 
will like it very much indeed!

mjPERLATIVES sufficiently 
^ gaudy to describe this book 
are hard to find. This is it, 
friends — the real interplanetary 
tomorrow! 

The difference between all previous books on space flight and 
this book is in essence the difference between science fiction 
and science. 

In the past, it has been, "This 
is the way it might be, if — " But 
with this magnificent volume it 
becomes, "This is the way it will 
be!" 

It has been written by a group 
of scientists and engineers who 
really know the practical realities 
of airless flight; and it seems, 
after one finally puts the book 
down, breathless, that there are 
practically no questions which 
they have not answered. 

The book is based on material 
originally presented at the First 
Symposium on Space Travel, 
held on Columbus Day, 1951, at 
the Hayden Planetarium, New 
York, and more fully developed

in a special issue of Colliers, 
March 22, 1952. 

Contributors are: Joseph Kaplan, Professor of Physics; Wernher von Braun, co-designer of 
the German V-2 rocket ; Heinz 
Haber, specialist in the medical 
aspects of airless, weightless 
flight; our own Willy Ley, who 
was one of the original organizers 
of the symposium ; Oscar Schachter, deputy director of the Legal 
Division of the United Nations; 
and Fred Whipple, Chairman of 
the Department of Astronomy at 
Harvard University. 

Not a single visionary among 
them! 

The magnificent illustrations 
(ten in full color) by Chesley 
Bonestell, Fred Freeman and 
Rolf Klep make tangible the 
machines and the nature of space 
flight that the book describes. 
They are almost frighteningly 
real! • 

The only cavil one might have 
against the book is the way in 
which it tries to "sell" space travel for strictly military reasons. 

Gentlemen, please do not forget that scientific progress can 
be made in peacetime. There's no 
law against it, is there? Of course, 
it'll be easier to raise the needed 
four billions for the first space 
station during war ; but what's 
the point if we end up using it 
to destroy Earth? We might just 
as welt have stood in bed!

28 SCIENCE FICTION STORIES by H. G. Wells. Dover Publictions. Inc., New Yqrk, 1952. 924 
pa^es, $3.95 

A NOTHER whopping Dover 
omnibus can now be put on 
the shelf along with the previous 
Wells and Haggard novel collections. This one just about, but 
not quite, puts all of Wells's science fantasy back in print. A few 
Utopian novels, many of them 
dull, remain unreprinted. 

Every science fiction short 
story is in this book, plus two 
novels — Men Like Gods and Sfar 
Begotten. Omitted are six straight 
fantasies, which would have violated the "science fiction" promise of the title. 

However, what is offered here 
is so wonderful that the omissions are not noticeable (except 
to the editor of the volume — the 
undersigned.) The facts are that 
Wells's science fiction short stories are still among the finest ever 
written. 

BEACHHEADS IN SPACE, edited by August Derleth. Pellegrini & Cudahy, New York, 1952. 
320 pages, $3.95 

MR. Derleth's twelfth anthology contains 14 stories, 5 of 
which are A, 2 are B-, one is C, 
and 6 are D or D-. This is really 
what we reviewers are prone to 

ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



define as an "uneven" selection. 

Six stories deal with invaders 
of Earth; 6 with Terran explorations of space; and 2 serve as 
beginning and ending of the 
volume. Class A stories are 
Simak's "Beachhead," van Vogt's 
"Repetition," Russell's previously 
anthologized "Metamorphosite," 
Asimov's "Breeds There A 
Man . . . ?" and Wyndham's 
"And the Walls Came Tumbling 
Down." The rest of the tales 
(even the mildly "B" ones) we 
really can do without. 

The idea behind the book is 
good, though not original. It is 
unfortunate that it is filled out 
with such a thin and inadequate 
group of tales. 

THE LONG LOUD SILENCE 
by Wilson Tucker. Rinehart & 
Co., New York, 1952. 217 pages, 
$2.50 

TV7ILSON ("Bob") Tucker's 
™* second science fiction novel 
is in the classic tradition of the 
wandering few humans living in 
a largely destroyed world or continent. 

Unfortunately, it can claim 
little of the imaginative richness 
or the philosophic perceptions 
that other tales in this category 
have possessed. 

Nevertheless, it is easily readable, and will serve to pass a 
couple of hours without boredom. 



The "Enemy" has knocked out 
the U.S.A. east of the Mississippi 
with plague germs and only a 
few immune plague-carriers survive. Atom bombs, of course, 
preceded the germ warfare. West 
of the Big River, the "Enemy" 
did nothing, and civilization 
marches on there, including radio 
commercials and the like. 

The story tells about the dirty 
adventures of a heel who happened to be among the few 
immune carriers east of the Mississippi, and who eventually 
managed to cross to the west side. 
There he spreads plague along 
with his criminal ventures. 

GREEN FIRE, by John Taine. 
Fantasy Publishing Co., Inc., Los 
Angeles, 1952. 313 pages, $3.00 

¥ HAVE not read all of Taine's 
stories, only about six or 
eight; and I have read a lot of 
science fiction by other people. 
This is just about the worst yet, 
and its reprinting at this late 
date (it was originally published 
by Dutton in 1928) can only 
weaken science fiction and damage Dr. Eric Bell's ("John 
Taine's") reputation. 

The story is about a crazy scientist who learns how to dissolve 
the Universe and who darn near 
does so. 

A pox upon him!

know thy neighbor 



By ELISABETH R. LEWIS 

The terrors that inhabit the 
night may be even more awful 
in deceitful broad daylight! 




IT BEGAN with the dead cat 
on the fire escape and ended 
with the green monster in 
the incinerator chute, but still, it 
wouldn't be quite fair to blame 
it all on the neighborhood . . . 

The apartment house was in 
the heart of the district that is 
known as "The Tenderloin" — 
that section of San Francisco 
from Ellis to Market and east 
from Leavenworth to Mason 



Street. Not the best section. 

To Ellen's mind, it was an unsavory neighborhood, but with 
apartments so hard to get and 
this one only $38.00 a month and 
in a regular apartment building 
with an elevator and all — well, 
as she often told the girls at the 
office, you can't be too particular 
these days. 

Nevertheless, it was an ordeal 
to walk up the two blocks from 



100 




 



Illustrated by TOM BEECKAM 



Market Street, particularly at 
night when the noise of juke boxes 
dinned from the garish bars, when 
the sidewalks spilled over with 
soldiers and sailors, with peroxided, blowsy- looking women and 
the furtive gamblers who haunted 
the back rooms of the innocentappearing cigar stores that lined 
the street. She walked very fast 
then, never looking to left or 
right, and her heart would pound 



when a passing male whistled. 

But once inside the apartment 
house lobby, she relaxed. In spite 
of its location, the place seemed 
very respectable. She seldom met 
anyone in the lobby or the elevator and, except on rare occasions like last night, the halls 
were as silent as those in the 
swanky apartment houses on Nob 
Hill. 

She knew by sight only two 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



101 



of her neighbors — the short, 
stocky young man who lived in 
410, and Mrs. Moffatt, in 404. 
Mrs. Moffatt was the essence of 
lavender and old lace, and the 
young man — he was all right, 
really; you couldn't honestly say 
he was shady-looking. 

r\N THIS partfcular morning, 
the man from 410 was waiting for the elevator when Ellen 
came out to get her paper. He 
glanced up at the sound of the 
door and stared. Quickly, she 
shut the door again. She didn't 
like the way he looked at her. 
She was wearing a housecoat over 
her nightgown, and a scarf wrapped around her head to cover 
the bobbypins — a costume as unrevealing as a nun's — but she felt 
as though he had invaded her 
privacy with his stare, like surprising her in the bathtub. 

She waited until she heard the 
elevator start down before opening her door again. The boy must 
have aimed from the stairs; her 
paper was several yards down 
the hall, almost in front of 404. 
She went down to get it. 

Mrs. Moffatt must have heard 
Ellen's footsteps in the hall. An 
old lady with a small income 
(from her late husband, as she 
had explained to Ellen) and little 
to do, she was intensely interested in her neighbors. She opened 
the door of her apartment and 



peered out. Her thin white hair 
was done up in tight kid curlers. 
With her round faded-blue eyes 
and round wrinkled -apple cheeks, 
she looked like an inquisitive 
aged baby. 

"Good morning," said Ellen 
pleasantly. 

"Good morning, my dear," the 
old lady answered. "You're up 
early for a Saturday." 

"Well, I thought I might as 
welt get up and start my housecleaning. I didn't sleep a wink 
after four o'clock this morning 
anyway. Did you hear all that 
racket in the hall?" 

"Why, no, I didn't." The old 
lady sounded disappointed. "I 
don't see how I missed it. I guess 
because I went to bed so late. 
My nephews — you've seen them, 
haven't you? — They're such nice 
boys. They took me to a movie 
last night." 

"Well, I'm surprised you didn't 
hear it," said Ellen. "Thumping 
and scratching, like somebody 
was dragging a rake along the 
floor. I just couldn't get back to 
sleep." 

The old lady clicked her 
tongue. "I'll bet somebody came 
home drunk. Isn't that terrible? 
I wonder who it was." 

"I don't know," said Ellen, "but 
it was certainly a disgrace. I was 
going to call Mrs. Anderson." 

With the door open, the hall 
seemed filled with the very odd 



102 




 



odor of Mrs. Moffatt's apartment 
— not really unpleasant, but 
musty, with the smell of antiques. 
The apartment itself was like a 
museum. Ellen had been inside 
once when the old lady invited 
her in for a cup of tea. Its two 
rooms were crammed with a bizarre assortment of furniture, 
bric-a-brac and souvenirs. 

"Oh, how's your bird this morning?" Ellen asked. 

In addition to being a collector, 
Mrs. Moffatt was an animal fancier. She owned three cats, a 
pair of love-birds, goldfish, and 
even a cage of white mice. One 
of the love-birds, she had informed Ellen yesterday, was ailing. 

"Oh, Buzzy's much better today," she beamed. "The doctor 
told me to feed him whisky every 
three hours — with an eyedropper, 
you know — and you'd be surprised how it helped the little 
fellow. He even ate some birdseed this morning." 

"I'm so glad," said Ellen. She 
picked up her paper and smiled 
at Mrs . Moffatt. "I'll see you 
later." 

The old woman closed her door, 
shutting off the musty smell, and 
Ellen walked back to her own 
apartment. She filled the coffee 
pot with water and four tablespoons of coffee, then dressed 
herself while the coffee percolated. Standing in front of the 



medicine cabinet mirror, she took 
the bobbypins out of her hair. 
Her reflection looked back at her 
from the mirror, and she felt that 
unaccountable depression again. 
I'm not bad-looking, she thought, 
and young, and not too dumb. 
What have other women got that 
I haven't ? She thought of the 
days and years passing, the meals 
all alone, and nothing ever happening. 

That kind of thinking gets you 
nowhere; forget it. She combed 
her hair back, pinned it securely 
behind her ears, ran a lipstick 
over her mouth. Then she went 
into the kitchenette, turned off 
the gas flame under the coffee 
pot, and raised the window shade 
to let in the sun that was just 
beginning to show through morning fog. 

A dead cat lay on the fire escape under the window. 

SHE stared at it, feeling sick 
to her stomach. It was an 
ordinary gray cat, the kind you 
see in every alley, but its head 
was twisted back so that its open 
eyes and open mouth leered at 
her. 

She pulled the blind down, fast. 

Sit down, light a cigarette. It's 
nothing, just a dead cat, that's 
all. But how did it get on the 
fire escape? Fell, maybe, from 
the roof? And how did it get on 
the roof? Besides, I thought cats 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



103 



never got hurt falling. Isn't there 
something about landing on your 
feet like a cat? Maybe that's just 
a legend, like the nonsense about 
nine lives. 

Well . what do I do. she 
thought. I can't sit here and drink 
coffee with that under the window. And God knows I can't 
take it away myself. She shuddered at the thought. Call the manager. 

She got up and went to the 
telephone in the foyer. She found 
the number scribbled on the back 
of the phone book. Her hand was 
shaking when she dialed. 

"This is Ellen Tighe in 402. 
Mrs. Anderson, there's a dead 
cat on the fire escape outside my 
window. You'll have to do something about it." 

Mrs. Anderson sounded halfasleep. "What do you mean, a 
dead cat? Are you sure it's dead? 
Maybe it's sleeping." 

"Of course I'm sure it's dead! 
Can't you send Pete up to take 
it away? It's a horrible thing to 
have under my window." 

"All right, I'll tell Pete to go 
up. He's washing down the lobby 
now. As soon as he's finished, 
I'll send him up." 

Ellen set the phone back on 
its stand. She felt a little silly. 
What a fuss to make over a dead 
cat. But really, outside one's 
window — and before breakfast — 
who could blame me? 



She went back into the kitchenette, carefully not looking toward 
the window, even though the 
shade was drawn, and poured 
herself a cup of coffee. Then she 
sat at the table in the little nook, 
drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette and leafing through the paper. 

The front page was all about 
a flying saucer scare in Marin 
County. She read the headline, 
then thumbed on through the paper, stopping to read the movie 
reviews and the comic page. 

A T THE back section, she was 
attracted by a headline that 
read: "Liquor Strong These Days 
— Customer Turns Green, Says 
Bartender." It was a brief item, 
consciously cute. "John Martin, 
38, a bartender of 1 52 Mason 
Street, was arrested early this 
morning, charged with drunkenness and disturbing the peace, 
after firing several shots from a 
.38 revolver on the sidewalk in 
front of his address. No one was 
injured. Martin's defense, according to police records, was 
that he was attempting to apprehend a *pale-green, claw-handed' 
customer who fled after eating 
a live mouse and threatening 
Martin. 

"Upon questioning, Martin admitted that the unidentified customer had been in the bar for 
several hours and appeared per


104 




 



fectly normal. But he insisted, 
'When I refused to serve him 
after he ate the mouse, he turned 
green and threatened to claw me 
to death,' Martin has a permit to 
carry the gun and was dismissed 
with a fifty dollar fine and a 
warning by Judge Greely against 
sampling his own stock too 
freely." 

Drunken fool, thought Ellen. 
With fresh indignation, she remembered the disturbance in her 
own hall this morning. Nothing 
but drunks and gangsters in this 
neighborhood. She thought 
vaguely of looking at the "For 
Rent" section of the want ads. 

There was a noise on the fire 
escape. Ellen reached over and 
lifted up the shade. The janitor 
was standing there with a big 
paper sack in his hand. 

Ellen opened the window and 
asked, "How do you think it got 
there, Pete?" 

"I dunno. Maybe fall offa the 
roof. Musta been in a fight." 

"What makes you think so?" 

' 'Neck's all torn. Big teeth 
marks. Maybe dog get him." 

"Up here?" 

"Somebody find, maybe throw 
hfre — I dunno." Pete scratched 
his head. "You don't worry any 
more, though. I take away now. 
No smell, even." 

He grinned at her and scuttled 
to the other end of the fire escape 
where he climbed through the 



window to the fourth floor corridor. 

Ellen poured herself a second 
cup of coffee and lighted another 
cigarette, then turned to the woman's page in the paper. She 
read the Advice Column and the 
Psychology and glanced through 
the "Help Wanted — Women" in 
the classifieds. That finished the 
morning's reading. She looked at 
her watch. Almost ten. 

She carried her coffee cup to 
the sink, rinsed it out and set it 
on the drainboard. There was 
still a cup or more coffee left in 
the pot. That could be warmed 
over later, but she took out the 
filler and dumped the grounds 
into the paper bag that held 
garbage. The bag was almost 
full. 

I'll throw it in the incinerator 
now, she thought, before I 
straighten the apartment. 

She emptied the ashtrays — the 
one beside her bed and the other 
on the breakfast table — then 
started down the hall with the 
garbage bag in her hand. 

^T^HE incinerator chute was at 
the rear of the hall, next to 
the service stairs. Ellen could see--, 
the door standing slightly open. 
She hesitated. 410 might be there. 
It was bad enough to ride in the 
elevator with him, feeling his 
eyes on her, but there was something unbearably intimate about 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



105 



standing beside him, emptying 
garbage. 

The door seemed to move a 
little, but nobody came out. She 
waited another minute. Oh, well, 
maybe the last person out there 
just forgot to shut the door tight. 
She opened it wider, stepped out 
on the stair landing. No one was 
there. 

The chute was wide, almost 
three feet around. Ellen opened 
the top and started to throw the 
bag down. Something was stuck 
in there. Her eyes saw it, but her 
brain refused to believe. 

What was there, blocking the 
chute, looked like — looked like — 
a chicken's foot, gnarled, clawed, 
but as large as a human foot — 
and an ugly, sickly green! 

Automatically, she reached in 
and clutched it. Her stomach 
turned at the cold feel of the 
thing, but still she tugged at it, 
trying to work it loose. It was 
heavy. She pulled with all her 
strength, felt it start to slide back 
up the chute. Then it was free! 

She gaped in sick horror at the 
thing she held. Her hand opened 
weakly and she sat down on the 
floor, her head swimming and her 
throat muscles retching. Dimly, 
she heard the thing rattle and 
bump down to the incinerator 
in the basement. 

The full horror of it gradually 
hit home. Ellen stood up, swaying, and ran blindly down the 



hall. Her feet thudded on the 
carpeted floor. As she passed 404, 
she was vaguely conscious of Mrs. 
Moffatt's concerned face poking 
around the door. 

"Is there something wrong. 
Miss Tighe?" 

"No," Ellen managed to gasp 
"It's all right — really — all right." 

She kept on running, burst 
through the apartment door, 
slammed it behind her, fell on 
her knees in the bathroom and 
became thoroughly, violently ill. 

She continued to kneel, unable 
to think, her head against the cool 
porcelain bowl. Finally, she stood 
up weakly, ran cold water, washed her face and streaming eyes. 
Thank God the wall bed was still 
down! She fell on it, shaking. 

YV/HAT was that unbelievable 
ghastly, impossible thing? 
It was the size of a man, but thin, 
skeleton thin, and the color of 
brackish water. It had two legs, 
two arms, like a man . . . but ending with those huge, birdlike 
claws. Heaven alone knew what 
its face was like. She had let go 
before it was that far clear of the 
chute. 

She thought of the story in the 
paper. So that was what the bartender saw! He wasn't xlrunk at 
all, and what happened when he 
told the police? They laughed at 
him. They'd laugh at me, too, 
she thought. The proof is gone. 



106 




 



burned up in the incinerator. Why 
did this happen to me? Dead cats 
on the fire escape, dead monsters 
in the incinerator chute . . . it's 
this terrible neighborhood! 

She tried to think coherently. 
Maybe the cat had something to 
do with it. The bartender said the 
thing ate a mouse — maybe it had 
tried to eat the cat, too. A monster like that might eat anything. 
Her stomach started churning 
again at the thought. 

But what was it doing in the 
incinerator chute? Someone in 
the building must have put it 
there, thinking it would slide all 
the way down and be burned up. 
Who? One of them, probably. 
But there couldn't be any more 
green monsters around. They 
can't live in an apartment house, 
walk the streets like anyone else, 
not even in this neighborhood. 

She remembered something else 
in the bartender's story. He said 
it looked perfectly normal at first. 
That meant they could look like 
humans if they wanted to. Hypnotism? Then any man could 
be . . . 

Suddenly another thought 
struck her. Supposing they find 
out I saw — what will they do to 
me? 

She jumped up from the bed, 
white with fear, her faintness forgotten in the urge to escape. She 
snatched her bag from the dresser, threw on her brown coat. 



At the door, she hesitated, 
afraid to venture into the hall, 
yet afraid to stay inside. Finally, 
she eased open the door, peered 
out into the corridor. It was deserted. She ran to the elevator, 
punched the bell, heard the car 
begin its creaky, protesting ascent. 

The elevator door had an automatic spring closing. The first 
time she tried it, her hands shook 
and the door sprang closed before she got in. She tried it again. 
This time she managed to hold it 
open long enough to get inside. 
She pushed the button, felt the 
elevator shake and grind and 
move slowly down. 

Out into the lobby. 

Out into the street. 

HPHE FOG was completely gone 
now. The sun shone on the 
still-damp street. There were 
very few people around — The 
Tenderloin sleeps late. She went 
into the restaurant next door, 
sat down at the white-tiled counter. She was the only customer. 
A sleepy-eyed waitress, her black 
hair untidily caught into a net, 
waited, pad in hand. 

"Just coffee," Ellen mumbled. 

She drank it black and it scalded her throat going down. The 
waitress put a nickel in the juke 
box and then Bing Crosby was 
singing "Easter Parade." Everything was so normal. Listening to 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



107 



Bing Crosby, how could you 
believe in things like green 
monsters? In this sane, prosaic 
atmosphere, Ellen thought, I 
must be batty. 

She said to herself, "I'm Ellen 
Tighe, bookkeeper, and I just saw 
the body of a green man with 
claws on his feet . . ." No, that 
didn't help a bit. Put it this way: 
"I'm Ellen Tighe and I'm 27 
years old and I'm not married. 
Let's face it, any psychiatrist will 
tel! you that's enough cause for 
neurosis. So I'm having delusions." 

It made more sense that way. 
I read that story in the paper, 
Ellen thought, and it must have 
registered way down in my subconscious. That had to be it. Any 
other way, it was too horrible, 
too impossible to be borne. 

I'll go back to the apartment 
and call Dr. Clive, thought Ellen. 
She had the feeling, no doubt 
held over from the days of 
measles and mumps, that a doctor could cure anything, even 
green monsters on the brain. 

She drank the last of the coffee 
and fished in her coin purse for 
change. Picking up the check, 
she walked over to the cash register at the end of the counter, 
facing the street. The untidy 
waitress came from the back of 
the restaurant to take the money. 

Ellen looked out at the street 
through the glass front. The man 



from 410 was standing out there, 
smoking a cigarette, watching 
her. When their eyes met, he 
abruptly threw away the cigarette and started walking toward 
the apartment house. Again she 
felt that faint dread she had experienced in the hall earlier. 

The waitress picked up her 
quarter, gave her back a nickel 
and a dime. Ellen put the change 
into her purse, got out her key 
chain and held it in her hand 
while she walked quickly next 
door. 410 was just ahead of her 
in the lobby; he held the front 
door open for her. 

She kept her head down, not 
looking at his face, and they 
walked, Indian file, across the 
lobby to the elevator. He opened 
the elevator doors, too, and she 
stepped in ahead of him. 

WHEN the doors clanged shut, 
she had a feeling of panic. 
Alone with him . . . cut off from 
help. He didn't pretend not to 
know her floor, but silently pressed the proper button. While the 
car moved slowly upward, her 
heart was beating wildly. 

I'm not convinced, she thought, 
I'm not convinced. I saw it so 
plainly ... I felt it, cold in my 
hands. 

The elevator stopped. The man 
held the door open and for a 
moment she thought he was going to say something. His free 




 



hand made a swift, involuntary 
movement as though he were 
going to catch her arm. She 
shrank away, but he stepped back 
and let her through. 

Ellen almost ran down the hall. 
Behind her, she heard his footsteps going in the opposite direction toward his apartment. She 
was panting when she reached 
her door. She fumbled for the 
right key — front door, office — 
and then she froze. There was a 
scratching sound in the apartment. 

She put her ear close to the 
door, listened. There was a rasping noise, like somebody dragging a rake ... or like claws, 
great heavy claws, moving over 
the hardwood floors! 

Ellen backed away from the 
door. It was true, then. She retreated, inch by inch, silently. 
Get away, leave before it catches 
you! She turned, ready to make 
a dash for the elevator . . . and 
faced the man from 410. 

Down at the end of the hall, 
in front of his apartment, he was 
watching her. The way he lingered outside the restaurant, the 
way he looked at her. One of 
them . . . maybe underneath that 
homely, ordinary face, his skin 
was green and clammy. Maybe 
there were long, sharp claws on 
his feet. 

She was breathing unevenly 



now. Trapped! The thing in the 
apartment, the man in the hall. 
Her eyes darted to the elevator, 
then back, down the hall, past 
the door marked 404 . . . the door 
marked 404! She covered the few 
yards in a mad dash, flung herself at the door, pounding wildly. 

"Please, please!" she sobbed. 
"Mrs. Moffatt, open, please!" 

The door opened at once. Mrs. 
Moffatt's round, wrinkled face 
beamed at her. 

"Come in, my dear, come in." 

She almost fell over the landing. The door closed behind her. 

She stumbled to the davenport, 
sank down, gasping. Two cats 
rubbed against her legs, purring. 
Two cats? 

She heard herself say stupidly, 
"Mrs. Moffatt, where's the other 
cat?" and wondered why she said 
it. 

Then she understood. 

The old lady's face quivered, 
altered, melted into something 
. . . something green. 

|~WUTSIDE in the hall, the man 
^-^ from 410 slowly returned to 
his apartment. Pushing open the 
door, he thought, I'll never get 
the nerve to ask her out. 

Well, probably wasn't a chance, 
anyhow. What would a girl like 
her have to do with a lousy cop 
like me?

Conclusion of 3-Part Serial 
Vkkers was safe on the other world, but he had to return tor 
Ann— or she'd be slain by those who tried to fight evolution! 

SYNOPSIS 



TV/Oi?LZ> industry is fighting 
** for its life against a group 
of mutants who are attempting to 
destroy the world" s economic system as the first step in building 
a new and better world. 

The world, in this year of 1977, 
is in a mess. The cold war still 



goes on. The people of the world 
have lived so long under tension 
that tension has become the normal way of life. 

An indication of this tension is 
the rapid spread of the Pretentionist clubs, whose members seek 
security by pretending that they 



Illustrated by DON SIBLEY 



110 



are living in the past. 

The mutants' attack on world 
industry has taken the form of 
placing on the market everlasting cars, razor blades, cigarette 
lighters and light bulbs, thus destroying one industry after another. 

Jay Vickers, a writer, is introduced to George Crawford by 
his agent, Ann Carter. Crawford 
is head of a coalition of industrial interests which have organized to fight the mutant menace. 
Crawford wants Vickers to write 
a book exposing the mutant plot 
and Vickers refuses. 

Vickers and Ann are in love, 
but Vickers does not realize it. 
He is obsessed with the memory 
of a walk with his lost love, Kathleen Preston, 20 years ago, in 
what seemed to be an enchanted 
valley. 

An old eccentric neighbor, Morton Flanders, hints that there is 
a new factor in the world which 
is keeping the world from war 
and that this same factor^ in the 
last 80 years, has nudged the 
human race into a technological 
gallop. 

When Flanders disappears, the 
village suspects Vickers of having 
done away with him. Eb, the garageman, warns Vickers that a 
lynch mob is forming and loans 
him a new Forever car, one of 
the mutant products, to use to 
make a getaway. 



Fleeing, Vickers returns to the 
country where he had spent his 
childhood and fallen in love with 
Kathleen Preston. There, in the 
now abandoned house where he 
had lived as a boy, he finds a 
top, a lost childhood toy. He remembers a fact which until then 
he had utterly forgotten — as a 
boy of eight, he had used the top 
to go into what had seemed to 
be fairyland. 

He is contacted by Crawford, 
who says that Vickers and Ann 
Carter are latent mutants. He 
tells Vickers that the normal humans have a secret weapon they 
will not hesitate to use against 
the mutants, pleads with Vickers 
to aid him in enabling the two 
groups to reach an understanding 
short of war. 

With Crawford gone, Vickers 
tries to phone Ann in New York, 
intending to warn her to get out 
of Crawford's reach, but her telephone does not answer. Vickers 
starts back to New York, but 
when he stops at a town, his car 
is wrecked by a mob. Escaping, 
Vickers finds a newspaper, which 
reveals that mutant shops are being wrecked, mutants are being 
hunted down. 

Vickers risks his life to go back 
to his wrecked car and retrieve 
the top he has found. Spotted, he 
eludes his pursuers and takes 
temporary refuge in the back 
room of a hardware store. 




 



In a frantic bid to escape, he 
uses the top which once before 
had taken him into "fairyland," 
although he knows that it could 
not have been fairyland, but another world co-existing with our 
own. 

The top carries him back to 
a wilderness, with no sign of Man 
anywhere. Fearing that he is 
trapped in a primitive, empty 
world, he sets out for the region 
where his and Kathleen's homes 
were located in the normal world, 
feeling that, if anywhere, he will 
find humans there. 

After days of travel on foot 
through the wilderness, he stumbles on what apparently is a factory operated entirely by robots 
and is convinced that mutants 
are operating it to manufacture 
their everlasting products. 

He finds the home of Kathleen 
Preston duplicated in the co-existent world, but Kathleen is not 
there. Led into a waiting room by 
a robot, he overhears a conversation and learns that he is not 
a human being, but an android, 
a human manufactured by the 
mutants, and so is Ann Carter. 
One of the voice he recognizes 
as that of Horton Flanders. 

Enraged and chagrined, Vickers leaves the house and wanders 
into the woods. There he meets 
a man by the name of Asa Andrews, a colonist who has been 
brought to this place, which he 



calls Earth No. 2. The mutants, 
Andrews explains, are bringing 
the economically and socially oppressed members of the human 
race there to give them a new 
start in life. There are an infinite number of co-existing earths 
traveling in a ring around the 
Sun, so that wi th the way between the earths now opened by 
the mutants, there is no end to 
living space and opportunity for 
the human race. 

Vickers tries to figure out the 
setup. The mutants apparently 
are using Earth No. 2 as an operating base. Because their numbers are small, they employ 
robots and androids to carry on 
their campaign against humanity. 
He is surprised by the many 
things which he actually seems 
to know, almost as if he had a 
previous memory of the situation. 

He goes back to the Preston 
house and there demands an explanation of Flanders. The mind 
and personality of the actual 
Vickers, Flanders explains, have 
been transferred to the android 
Vickers, so that, when his mind 
is returned to the original Jay 
Vickers, he will be able to transmit to his children, through the 
inherent memory factor, all the 
advantages of full-blown mutation. 

Flanders says one of the factors of mutancy which Vickers 
carries is a hunch ability, badly 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



113 



needed to win the fight for a mutant world. The hunch ability, 
Flanders explains, is the development of a hidden human trait 
which does away with the necessity of slow, tortuous human reasoning. 

He tells Vickers that his job is 
to stop Crawford, that he is the 
only man who can do it. Vickers 
is reluctant to fall in with the 
mutant campaign. Flanders dangles a reward in front of Vickers: 
When Crawford and his gang 
have been stopped, Vickers and 
Kathleen will be returned to the 
age of 18. It will be as if all the 
other years had never been. They 
will be 18 and in love and they 
may even hope for immortality, 
since the mutants are close to the 
secret of eternal life. 

With Flanders gone, Vickers 
asks a robot, Hezekiah, to bring 
him the record of his and Kathleen's families. He finds that his 
mother and father have been 
placed in suspended animation to 
await the day when the mutants 
have established a new human 
society and immortality is available. Vickers, who had been on 
the verge of walking out on 
Flanders and the mutants, now 
realizes that he has no choice but 
to work for the mutants, thus to 
keep the faith that his parents 
held in the mutant cause. 

Hezekiah says, however, that 
there is no record of any Preston 



family. Vickers wonders if Kathleen may be no more than an 
emotional trap introduced into 
his android brain to keep him 
tied to the cause of mutation 

"Hezekiah," he asks, "who is 
Horton Flanders?" 

"Horton Flanders," says the 
robot, "is an android, just the 
same as you." 

XXXVII 

SO Vickers was supposed to 
stop Crawford. But first he 
had to figure out the angles. 

There was the might of industry, not one industry alone, but 
the might of all the industry in 
the entire world. There was the 
fact that Crawford and industry 
had declared open war upon the 
mutants. And there was the matter of the secret weapon. 

"Desperation and a secret weapon," Crawford had said, sitting 
in the hotel room. "But the secret weapon," he had added, 
"isn't good enough." 

First of all, Vickers had to 
know what the secret weapon 
was. Until he knew that, there 
would be no point in making any 
plans. 

He lay in bed and stared at 
the ceiling and sorted out the 
facts and had a look at them. 
Then he juggled them a bit, balancing the strength of normal 
human against the strength of 



114 




 



mutant. There were many places 
where they canceled one another 
and there were other instances 
where they did not. 

He got exactly nowhere. 

"And of course I won't,*' he 
said. "This is the old awkward 
normal human way of doing. This 
is reasoning." 

Hunch was the thing. 

And how to do the hunching? 

He swept the factors from his 
mind and lay upon the bed, staring at the darkness where the 
ceiling was, and did not try to 
think, ' 

He could feel the factors 
bumping in his brain, bouncing 
together, then fleeing from each 
other, but he ignored and shunned them. 

An idea came: War. 

He thought about it and it grew 
and gripped him. 

War, but a different kind of 
war than the world had ever 
known. What was that phrase 
from the old history of the beginning of World War II? A 
phony war. And yet not a phony 
war. 

It was a disturbing thing to 
think about something you 
couldn't place — to have a hunch 
— that was it, a hunch gnawing 
at you and not knowing what it 
was. 

He tried to think about it and 
it retreated from him and he 
stopped thinking. 



Another idea came: Poverty. 

And poverty was somehow tied 
up with war and he sensed the 
two ideas, circling like coyotes 
around the campfire that was 
himself, snarling and growling at 
one another in the darkness beyond the flame of his understanding. 

He tried to banish them into 
the darkness and they would not 
banish. 

A FTER a time, he grew accustomed to them and it seemed 
that the campfire flickered lower 
and the coyote-ideas did not run 
so fast nor snap so viciously. 

There was another factor, said 
his sleepy mind. The mutants 
were short on manpower. That's 
why they had the robots and the 
androids. 

There would be ways you could 
get around a manpower shortage. 
You could take one life and split 
it into many lives. You could 
take one mutant life and you 
could spread it thin, stretch it 
out and make it last longer and 
go further. In the economy of 
manpower, you could do many 
things if you just knew how. 

The coyotes were circling more 
slowly now and the fire was growing dimmer and I'll stop you, 
Crawford, I'll get the answer and 
I'll stop you cold and I love you, 
Ann, and — 

Then, not knowing he had 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



115 



slept, he woke and sat upright 
in the bed. 
He knew! 

OHIVERING in the chill of 
summer dawn, he swung his 
legs from beneath the covers and 
felt the cold of the floor against 
his bare soles. 

Vickers ran to the door and 
yanked it open and came out into 
the landing. The stairway spiraled down into the hall below 
him. 

"Flanders !" he shouted. "Where 
are you, Flanders?". 

Hezekiah appeared from somewhere and began to climb the 
stairs, calling, "What is the matter, sir? Is there something you 
want?" 

"I want Horton Flanders!" 

Another door opened and 
Flanders stood there, bony ankles 
showing beneath his pajama bottom, sparse hair standing almost 
erect. 

"What's going on?" he asked, 
tongue still thick with sleep. 
"What's all this racket about?" 

Vickers strode across the hall 
and grabbed him by the shoulders 
and demanded, "How many of 
us are there, Flanders? How 
many ways was Jay Vickers' life 
divided?" 

"If you'll stop shaking me — " 

"I will when you tell me the 
truth!" 

"Oh, gladly," Flanders said. 



"There are three of us — you and 
I and . . 

"You?" 

"Certainly? Why not?" 

"But you're older than I." 

"You can do a great deal with 
synthetic flesh," said Flanders. 
"You should know that. I don't 
see why you're surprised." 

And he wasn't, Vickers suddenly realized. It was as if he had 
been aware of it all his life. 

"The third one?" he asked. 
"You said there are three of us." 

Flanders shook his head. "I'm 
afraid I can't tell you that yet." 

"Why not?" 

"It would — create complications for you. Impair your efficiency and thus your value." 

"By knowing who the other 
third of Jay Vickers is?" 

"Decidedly. Not only can I not 
tell you who it is, but I can't 
even explain why I can't, because 
it would give away what I must 
conceal from you." 

A frightful suspicion came into 
Vickers' mind. He stepped away 
from Flanders and his back 
touched the doorway to his own 
room and he leaned against it, 
shaking. 

"I know," he said. "I know who 
the other is." 

Flanders shrugged. "Perhaps. 
You won't get confirmation or 
denial from me." 

Vickers turned and faced him. 
"I have it now, everything you 



116 




 



hoped for. I know the secret weapon and the answer to it. You 
said I should stop Crawford. I 
can." 

"You're sure of that?" 

"Completely sure," said Vickers, "but what the hell's the use?" 

He went into his room and 
shut the door. 

XXXVIII 

rr*HERE had been a moment 
when he had seen his course 
straight and clear before him — 
the realization that Kathleen 
Preston might have been no more 
than a conditioned figment, that 
for years the implanted memory 
of the walk in the enchanted valley had blinded him to his love 
for Ann Carter and the love he 
now was sure she felt for him, 
disguised behind their silly bitter 
quarreling. 

Then had come the knowledge 
that his parents slept away the 
years in suspended animation, 
waiting for the coming of that 
world of peace to which they had 
given so much — waiting, too, 
for the immortality which alone 
could revitalize their aged bodies. 

And he had not been able to 
turn his back upon them. 

Perhaps, he told himself, it 
was just as well, for now there 
was this other factor — making 
more than one life out of a single 
individual. 



It was a sensible way to do 
things, possibly a valid method, 
for the mutants needed manpower. When you needed manpower, 
you did the best you could with 
what you had at hand. You 
placed in the hands of robots the 
work that could be left to robots, 
and you took men and women 
and out of each of those lives you 
made several, housing the living 
fractions in the bodies of your 
androids. 

Ann Carter was not another 
person, at all, but a part of him. 
For three androids had been 
given the spark of life from the 
person who had been Jay Vickers — he and Horton Flanders and 
Ann Carter. In time, the three of 
them would let their life flow 
back again into the body of the 
original Jay Vickers. And when 
that happened, he wondered, 
which one of them would continue as Jay Vickers? Or would 
none of them? Would it be a 
sentence of death for all three of 
them and a continuation of the 
consciousness that Jay Vickers 
himself had known? Or would 
the three of them be mingled, so 
that the resurrected Jay Vickers 
would be a Flanders-CarterVickers personality? 

TTE shook his head. There was 
no way of knowing. 
If it were the three of them, a 
commingling of the three of them, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



117 



God help the original Jay Vickers when he was resurrected. 

And the love he bore Ann Carter, the tenderness after the 
moonlight-and-roses years — what 
of that love now? 

There could be no such love, 
he knew. You could not love a 
facet of yourself or let a facet of 
yourself love you. 

Twice he had known love of a 
woman and twice it had been 
taken from him and now he was 
trapped with no other choice but 
to do the job that had been assigned him. 

He had told Crawford that 
when he knew what was going on, 
he'd come back and talk to him 
and between the two of them 
they'd see if there was a compromise. 

But there was no compromise 
now. 

Not if his hunch was right. 

And Flanders had said that 
hunch was a mutant way of reasoning, a more mature, more 
positive way of arriving at the 
answer to a problem. A method, 
Flanders had told him, that did 
away with the winding path of 
reason that the human race has 
used through all its formative 
years. 

For the secret weapon was the 
old, old weapon of deliberate 
war, waged with mathematical 
cynicism and calculated precision. 



How many wars, he wondered, 
could the human race survive? 
And the answer seemed to be: 
Just one more real war. 

The mutants were the survival 
factor in the race of Man and 
now there was nothing left to 
him — neither Kathleen nor Ann, 
nor even, perhaps, the hope of 
personal humanity. He must 
work as best he could to carry 
forward the lone hope of the 
human race. 

Someone tapped softly and politely at the door. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "Come on 
in." 

"Breakfast will be ready, sir," 
said Hezekiah, "by the time you 
get dressed." 

XXXIX 

INLANDERS was waiting for 
him in the dining room when 
Vickers came down the stairs. 

"The others left," said Flanders. "They had work to do. And 
you and I have plotting." 

Vickers did not answer. He 
pulled out a chair and sat down 
across from Flanders. The sunlight from the windows came 
down across Flanders' shoulders 
and his head stood out against 
the window glass in bold relief, 
with the whiteness of his hair like 
a fuzzy halo. His clothes still 
were slightly shabby and his 
necktie had seen better days, but 



118 




 



he still was neat and his face 
shone with the scrubbing he had 
given it. 

"I see that Hezekiah found 
some clothes for you," said Flanders. "I don't know what we'd 
do without Hezekiah." 

"A pack of money, too. It was 
lying on the dresser with the shirt 
and tie. I didn't take the time to 
count it, but there seem to be 
several thousand dollars." 

"Hezekiah thinks of everything." 

"But I don't want several 
thousand dollars." 

"Go ahead," said Flanders. 
"We've got bales of it." 

"Bales!" 

"Certainly. We keep making 
it." 

"You mean you counterfeit it?" 

"Oh, bless me, no," said Flanders, "although it's something we 
have often thought of. Another 
string to our bow, you might 
say." 

"You mean flood the normal 
world with counterfeit money?" 

"It wouldn't be counterfeit. We 
could duplicate the money exactly. Turn loose a hundred billion dollars of new money in the 
world and there'd be hell to pay." 

"I can see the point," said Vickers. "I'm amazed you didn't do 
it." 

Flanders looked sharply at 
him. "I have a feeling that you 
disapprove of us." 



"In some ways I do." 

TJEZEKIAH brought in a tray 
with tall glasses of cold 
orange juice, plates of scrambled 
eggs and bacon, buttered toast, 
a jar of jam and a pot of coffee. 

"Have you noticed," asked th*j 
robot, "how fine the morning is?"} 

"I have noticed that," said! 
Vickers. 

"The weather here is most un-j 
usually fine. Much finer, I am; 
told, than on the earth ahead." 

He served the food and left, 
out through the swinging door 
into the kitchen, where they could 
hear him moving about at his 
morning chores. 

"We have been humane," said ] 
Flanders, "as humane as possi- I 
ble. But we had a job to do and I 
once in a while someone got his j 
toes stepped on. It may be that j 
we will have to get a little rough- 1 
er now, because we are being ! 
pushed. If Crawford and his gang 
had just taken it a little easier, 
it would have worked out all 
right and we wouldn't have had 
to hurt them or anyone else. Now 
it has to amount almost to revolution. Had we been given twenty 
years more, it would have been 
evolution. Given time, we would 
have taken over not only world 
industry and world finance, but 
world government as well, only 
they didn't give us the time. The 
crisis came too soon." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



119 



"What we need now," said 
Vickers, "is a counter-crisis." 

"We set up dummy companies. 
We should have set up more, but 
we lacked the manpower. Given 
the manpower, we would have 
gone more extensively into the 
manufacture of certain basic 
gadgets. But we needed the little 
manpower we had at so many 
other places — at key points or 
to search for other mutants to 
enlist into our group." 

"There must be many mutants," Vickers said. 

"There are a number of them," 
agreed Flanders, "but a large 
percentage of them are so entangled in the world and the affairs of the normal world that 
you can't dislodge them. Take a 
mutant man married to a normal 
woman. You simply can't break 
up a happy marriage. Say some 
of their children are mutants — 
what can you do about them? 
Not a thing. You simply watch 
and wait. When they grow up 
and go out on their own, you 
can approach them, but not until 
then. 

"Take a banker or an industrialist upon whose shoulders 
rests an economic empire. Tell 
him he's a mutant and he'll laugh 
at you. He's made his place in 
life. He's satisfied. His loyalties 
are set to the pattern of the life 
he's made and there's nothing we 
can offer that will interest him." 



"You might try immortality," 
suggested Vickers. 

"We haven't got immortality." 

"You should have attacked on 
the governmental level." 

FLANDERS shook his head. 
"We did a little of it, but not 
much. With a thousand major 
posts in governments of the 
world, we would have won easily 
and quickly. But we didn't have 
the thousand mutant diplomats 
to train. By various methods, we 
headed off crisis after crisis. The 
carbohydrates relieved a situation which would have led to war. 
Helping the West get the hydrogen bomb years ahead of time 
held off the East just when they 
were set to strike. But we weren't 
strong enough and we didn't have 
the time to carry out any welldefined long-range program, so 
we had to improvise. We introduced gadgets as the only quick 
way we knew to weaken the socio-economic system of Earth 
and, of course, that meant that 
sooner or later we would force 
Earth industry to band against 
us." 

"What else would you expect?" 
asked Vickers. "You interfere . . ." 

"I suppose we do," said Flanders. "The human race is our 
patient. It has a malignant 
growth. We are surgeons. It will 
be painful for the patient and 
there will be a period of conval


120 




 



escence, but at least the patient 
will live and I have the gravest 
doubts that the human race could 
survive another war." 

"But the high-handed methods 
you use!" 

"Now wait a moment," Flanders objected. "You think there 
must be other methods and I will 
agree, but all of them would be 
equally objectionable to humanity and the old human methods 
themselves have been discredited 
long ago. Men have shouted 
peace and there has been no 
peace. You would have us hold 
conferences? I ask you, my 
friend, what is the history of the 
conference? 

"Or maybe we should go before the people, before the heads 
of government, and say to them 
we are the new mutations of the 
race and that our knowledge and 
our ability are greater than theirs 
and that they should turn all 
things over to us so we could 
bring the world to peace. What 
would happen then? I can tell 
you what would happen. They'd 
hate us and drive us out. So there 
is no choice for us. We must work 
underground. We must attack 
the key points. No other way will 
work." 

"TJP7HAT you say," said Vick" ers, "may be true so far as 
the people are concerned, but 
how about the individual? How 



about the little fellow who gets 
socked in the teeth?" > 

"Asa Andrews was here this 
morning," Flanders told him.^'He 
said you'd been at his place and 
had disappeared and he was worried about what might have happened to you. But that is beside 
the point. What I want to ask you 
is, would you say that Asa Andrews was a happy man?" 

"I've never seen anybody happier." 

"And yet," said Flanders, "we 
interfered with him. We took 
away his job — the job he needed 
to feed his family and clothe 
them and keep a roof above their 
heads. He searched for jobs and 
could find none. When he finally 
came for help, we knew that we 
were the ones who cost him his 
job that forced him finally to be 
evicted, to stand in the street and 
not know where his family would 
lay their heads that night. We did 
all this and yet, in the end, he is 
a happy man. There are thousands of others throughout this 
earth who have thus been interfered with and now are happy 
people. Happy, I must insist, 
because of our interference." 

"You can't claim," Vickers 
contended, "that there is no price 
for this happiness. I don't mean 
the loss of job, the bread of charity—but what comes afterward. 
You are settling them here on this 
earth in what you are pleased 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



to call a pastoral-feudal stage, 
but the fancy name you call it 
can't take away the fact that, in 
being settled here, they have lost 
many of the advantages of advanced civilization." 

"We have taken from them," 
Flanders said, "little more than 
the knife with which to cut their 
own or their neighbor's throat. 
Whatever else we've taken from 
them will in time be given back, 
in full measure and with fantastic 
interest. For it is our hope, Mr. 
Vickers, that in time to come they 
all will be like us, that eventually the entire race may have 
everything we have. 

"We are not freaks, you understand-, but human beings, the 
next step in evolution. We're just 
a step ahead of all the rest. To 
survive, Man had to change, had 
to mutate, had to become something more than what he was. We 
are only the first forerunners of 
that mutation of survival. And 
because we are the first, we must 
fight a delaying action. We must 
fight for the time that it will take 
for the rest of them to catch up 
with us. In us you see not one 
little group of privileged persons, 
but all of humanity." 

"Humanity," said Vickers 
sourly, "seems to be taking a dim 
view of your delaying fight to 
save them. Up on that world of 
ours, they're smashing gadget 
shops and hunting down the mu


tants and hanging them from 
lamp posts." 

"That's where you come in," 
Flanders pointed out. 

^TICKERS nodded. "You want 
* me to stop Crawford." 

"You told me you could." 

"I had a hunch." 

"Your hunches, my friend, are 
more likely to be right than the 
most precise reasoning." 

"I will need some help," said 
Vickers. 

"Anything you say." 

"I want some of your pioneers 
— men like Asa Andrews — sent 
back to do some missionary 
work." 

"But we can't do that," protested Flanders. 

"They're in this fight, too," 
said Vickers. "They can't expect 
to sit back and not lift a finger." 

"Missionary work? You want 
them to go back to tell about 
these other worlds?" 

"That is exactly what I want." 

"But no one would believe 
them. With the feeling running as 
it is on Earth, they would be 
mobbed and lynched." 

Vickers shook his head. "There 
is one group that would believe 
them — the Pretentionists. Don't 
you see, the Pretentionists are 
fleeing from reality. They pretend 
to go back and live iff the London 
of Pepys' day, and to many other 
eras of the past, but even there 



122 




 



they find certain restraining influences, certain encroachments 
upon their own free will and their 
security. But here there is complete freedom and security. Here 
they could go back to the simplicity, the uncomplicated living 
that they are yearning for. No 
matter how fantastic it might 
sound, the Pretentionists would 
embrace it." 

"You're certain of this?" asked 
Flanders. 

"Positive," said Vickers. 

"But that's not all?" 

"There is one thing more." said 
Vickers. "If there were a sudden 
demand on the carbohydrates, 
could you meet it?" 

"I think we could. We could 
reconvert our factories. The gadget business is shot now. To dispense carbohydrates, we'd have 
to set up a sort of black market 
system. If we went out in the 
open, Crawford and his crew 
would break it up." 

"At first, perhaps," agreed 
Vickers. "But not for very long. 
Not when tens of thousands of 
people would be ready to fight 
him to get their carbohydrates." 

"When the carbohydrates are 
needed," Flanders said, "they'll 
be there." 

"rpHE Pretentionists will believe," said Vickers. "They 
are ripe for belief, any kind of 
fantastic belief. To them it will 



be an ' imaginative crusade. 
Against a normal population, we 
might have no chance, but we 
have a great segment who have 
been driven to escape by the sickness of the world. All they need is 
a spark, a word — some sort of 
promise that there is a chance of 
real escape instead of the illusory 
escape they have been driven to. 
There will be many who will want 
to come to this second world. 
How fast can you bring them 
through?" 

"As fast as they come." 

"I can count on that?" 

"You can count on that." Flanders lifted his shoulders. "I don't 
know what you're planning. I 
hope your hunch is right." 

"You said it was," Vickers declared. 

"You know what you're going 
up against? You know what 
Crawford's planning?" 

"I think he's planning war. 
He said it was a secret weapon. 
I'm convinced it's war." 

"But war . . ." 

"Let's look at war," said Vickers, "just a little differently than 
it ever has been looked at, just 
a little differently than the historians see it. Let's see it as a 
business because war, in certain 
aspects, is just that. When a 
country goes to war, it means that 
labor and industry and resources 
are mobilized and controlled by 
governments. The businessman 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



123 



plays as important a part as does 
the military man. The banker 
and the industrialist are as much 
in the saddle as the general. 

"Now let's go one step further 
and imagine a war fought on 
strictly business lines — for the 
strictly business purpose of obtaining and retaining control in 
those very areas we are threatening. War would mean that the 
system of supply and demand 
would be suspended and that certain civilian items would cease to 
be manufactured and that the 
governments could crack down on 
anyone who would attempt to 
sell them . . .** 

"Like cars, perhaps," offered 
Flanders, "and lighters and even 
razor blades." 

"Exactly," Vickers told him. 
"That way they could gain the 
time, for they need time as badly 
as we do. Upon military pretext 
they'd seize complete control of 
the world economy." 

"What you're saying is that 
they plan to start war by agreement." 

"T'M convinced that's it," said 
Vickers. "They'd hold it to a 
minimum. Perhaps one bomb on 
New York in return for a bomb 
on Moscow and another on Chicago for one on Leningrad. You 
get the idea — a restricted war, a 
gentleman's agreement. Just 
enough fighting to convince ev


eryone that it was real. 

"But phony as it might be, a 
lot of people would die and 
there'd always be the danger that 
someone would get sore and instead of one bomb on Moscow it 
might be two, or the other way 
around, or an admiral might get 
just a bit too enthusiastic and a 
bit too accurate." 

"It's fantastic," Flanders said. 

"You forget that they are desperate men. They are fighting, 
every one of them. Russian and 
American, French and Pole and 
Czech, for the kind of life that 
Man has built upon the Earth. 
To them we must appear to be 
the most vicious enemy mankind's ever faced. They are 
frightened stiff." 

"And you?" asked Flanders. 

"I'd go back to old Earth, except that I lost the top. I don't 
know where I lost it, but . . ." 

"You don't need the top. That 
was just for novices. All you have 
to do is will yourself into the 
other world. Once you've done it, 
it's a cinch." 

"If I need to get in touch with 
you?" 

"Eb's your man," said Flanders. "Just get hold of him." 

"You'll send Asa and the 
others back?" 

"We will." 

Vickers rose and held out his 
hand. 

"But," said Flanders, ''you 



124 




 



don't need to leave just yet. Sit 
down and have another cup of 
coffee." 

Vickers shook his head. "I'm 
anxious to get going." 

"The robots could get you back 
to New York in no time at all," 
said Flanders. "You could return 
to old Earth from there." 

Vickers said, "I want time to 
think. I have to do some planning — hunching, you'd call it." 

"Buy a car," advised Flanders. 
"Hezekiah left you enough cash 
to get one and have some left 
over. Eb will have more, if you 
need it. It wouldn't be safe to 
travel any other way. They'll 
have traps set out for mutants. 
They'll be watching all the time." 

"I'll be careful," Vickers promised. 

- XL 

f|iHE room was dusty and festooned with spider webs and 
its emptiness made it seem much 
larger than it was. The paper was 
peeling from the walls and the 
plaster cracks ran like jagged 
chains of lightning from the ceiling molding to the baseboard at 
the floor. 

But one could see that at one 
time the peeling paper had been 
colorful, with garlands of little 
flowers and the larger figure of a 
Dresden shepherdess guarding 
woolly sheep and, beneath the 



film of dust, one knew the woodwork lay with some of the old 
wax still on it, ready to shine 
again when rescued from neglect. 

Vickers turned slowly in the 
center of the room and he saw 
that the doors were where they' 
had been and the windows, too, 
in that other room where he'd 
just risen from the chair after 
eating breakfast. But here the 
door to the kitchen stood open 
and the windows were dark with 
the shutters closed against them. 

He took a step or two and he 
saw that he left footprints in the 
dust and the footprints started at 
the center of the room. There 
were no footprints leading from 
anywhere to the center of the 
room. The tracks just started 
there. 

He stood and looked at the 
room and tried to reconstruct it, 
not as he had known it less than 
sixty seconds before, but as he 
first had seen it twenty years ago. 

Or was it fantasy — conditioned 
fantasy? Had he ever actually 
stood in this room before? Had 
there ever been a Kathleen Preston? And if there had been, had 
Jay Vickers ever loved her or had 
she ever loved Jay Vickers? 

He knew that a Vickers family, 
a poor farm family, had lived not 
more than -a mile from where he 
stood. He thought of them — the 
mother, courageous in her ragged dress and drab sweater; the 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



125 




father with the pitiful little shelf 
of books beside his bed and how 
he used to sit in faded overalls 
and too-big shirt, reading the 
books in the dim yellowness of 
the kerosene lamp; the son, a 
helter-skelter sort of kid who had 
too much imagination and once 
went to fairyland. 

Masquerade, he thought, a bitter masquerade, a listening post 
set out to spy out the talk of enemies. But it had been their job 
and they had done it well. They 
had watched their son grow into 
a youth and known by the manner 
of his growing that he was no 



throwback, but truly one of them. 

And now they waited, those 
two who had posed as lonely 
farmer folk for all the anxious 
years, fitting themselves into an 
ordinary niche wmch was never 
meant for such as they, against 
the day when they could take 
their rightful place in the society 
which they had given up to stand 
outpost duty for the big brick 
house standing proudly on its 
hill. 

He could not turn his back on 
them and now there was no need 
to turn his back on them, for 
there was nothing else. 




He walked across the dining 
room and along the hall that led 
to the closed front door and he 
left behind him a trail of footprints in the dust. 

Outside the door, he knew, was 
nothing — not Ann, nor Kathleen, 
nor any place for him — nothing 
but the cold knife-edge of duty 
to a life he had not chosen. 

XLI 

TIE had his moments of doubt 
while he drove across the 
country, savoring the goodness 
of the things he saw and heard 
and smelled — the little villages 
sleeping in the depth of summer 
with their bicycles and canted 
coaster wagons; the friendly 
bumbling of the great transport 
trucks on the highways; the way 
the girl behind the counter smiled 
at you when you stopped at a 
roadside eating place. 

There was nothing wrong, he 
told himself, nothing wrong with 
the little villages or the trucks or 
the girl who smiled at you when 
you asked for a cup of coffee. 
Man's world was pleasant and 
fruitful, a good place in which to 
live. 

The mutants and their plans 
seemed like a nightmare snatched 
from some lurid Sunday supplement and* he wondered, as he 
drove along, why he didn't simply pull off the road and let the 



car stay sitting there while he 
walked off into this good life he 
saw on every hand. Surely there 
was some place within it for a 
man like him; somewhere, here 
in the flat corn lands where the 
little villages clung to every 
crossroad, that a man could find 
peace and security. 

But he saw reluctantly it was 
not peace and security he sought 
for himself alone. Just a place 
to hide from the threat one could 
sense in the air. In wanting to 
leave his car beside the road and 
walk away, he was responding to 
the same bone-deep fear as the 
Pretentionists when they escaped 
emotionally to some other time 
and place. It was the urge to flee. 

The trouble was that even here, 
in the agricultural heart of the 
continent, one could feel secure 
only if one never read a paper or 
listened to a broadcast and did 
not talk with people. For the signposts of fear, of the eternal running from the threat of insecurity, 
could be found on every doorstep and in every home and at 
every corner. 

TTE read the papers and the 
news was bad. He listened to 
the radio and the commentators 
were talking about a new and 
deeper crisis than the world had 
ever faced. He listened to the 
people talking in the lobbies of 
the hotels where he spent the 



128 




 



nights or in the eating places 
where he stopped along the road. 
They would talk and shake their 
heads and one could See that they 
were worried. 

They said : "What I can't understand is how things could 
change so quick. Here, just a 
week or two ago, it looked like 
the East and West would band 
together against this mutant business. At last they had something 
they could fight together instead 
of fighting one another, but now 
they're back at it again and it is 
worse thatj ever." 

They said: "If you ask me, it's 
the Commies that stirred up this 
mutant business. You mark my 
word, they're at the bottom of 
it." 

They said: "It just don't seem 
possible. Here we sit tonight a 
million miles from- war with everything calm and peaceful. And 
tomorrow . . ." 

And tomorrow and tomorrow 
and tomorrow. 

They said: "If it was up to me, 
I'd get in touch with the mutants. 
They got stuff up their sleeve 
that would blow these Commies 
plumb to hell." 

They said: "We never should 
have demobilized at the end of 
World War II. We should have 
hit them then. We could've 
knocked them off in a month or 
two." 

They said: "The hell of it is 



that you never know. No one ever 
tells you anything and when they 
do, it's wrong." 

They said: "I wouldn't horse 
around with them a single damn 
minute. I'd load up some bombs 
and I'd let them have it." 

He listened to them and there 
was no talk of compromise or 
understanding. There was no 
hope in all the talk that war 
could be averted. "If not this 
time," they said, "it'll come in 
five years, or ten, so let's get it 
over with. You got to hit them 
first. In a war like this, there ain't 
any second chance. It's either 
them or us . . ." 

And it was then that he understood that even here, in the heartland of the nation, in the farms 
and little villages, in the roadside 
eating places, there was a boiling 
hate. That was the measure of 
the culture that had been built 
upon the Earth — a culture founded on a hatred and a terrible 
pride and a suspicion of everyone who did not talk the same 
language or eat the same food or 
dress the same as everyone else 
did. 

IT was a mechanical culture of 
clanking machines, a technological world that could provide 
creature comfort, but not human 
justice or security. It was a culture that had worked in metals, 
that had delved into the atom. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



129 



that had mastered chemicals and 
had built a complicated and 
dangerous gadgetry. It had concentrated upon the technological 
and had ignored the spiritual 
so that a man might punch a 
button and destroy a distant city 
without knowing, or even caring, 
about the lives and habits, the 
thoughts and hopes and beliefs 
of the people that he killed. 

Underneath the sleek technological surface, one could hear 
the warning rumble of machines. 
The gears and sprockets, the 
driving chain, the generator, 
without the brake of_human understanding, were racing on to 
disaster. 

He drove and ate and drove 
again. He ate and slept and drove. 
He watched the cornfields and 
the reddening apples in the orchards and heard the song of 
mower and smelled the scent of 
clover and he looked into the sky 
and felt the terrible fear that hung 
high there and he knew that 
Flanders had been right, that, to 
survive, Man must mutate and 
that the survival mutation must 
win before the storm of hate 
would break. 

But it was not only news of approaching war which rilled the 
columns of the daily press and 
spurred the news commentators 
into word-frothed quarter hours. 

There was still the mutant 
menace and the continuing ex


hortations to the people to keep 
a watch for mutants. There were 
riots and lynchings and gadget 
shops burned. 

And something else: 

A creeping whisper that spread 
across the land, that was talked 
over at the drugstore corners and 
at the dusty crossroads and in 
the shadowed night spots of the 
bigger cities— the whisper that 
there was another world, a brandnew world where one could start 
his life again, where one would 
escape from the thousands of 
years of accumulated mistakes. 

The press at first was wary of 
the rumor, then printed cautious 
stories with very restrained headlines and the commentators seemed at first to be just as wary, but 
finally took the plunge. In a day 
or two, the news of the other 
world and of the strange, starryeyed people who had talked to 
someone else (always someone 
else) and claimed they had come 
from there ranked with the news 
of approaching war and with 
hatred of the mutants. 

You could feel the world on 
edge, like the sudden, strident 
ringing of a telephone in the dead 
of night. 

XLII 

i^LIFFWOOD after dark had 
^^the smell and feel of home as 
Vickers drove along its streets 



130 




 



and felt the lump of loss come 
into his throat. It had been here 
that he had thought to settle 
down and spend his years in 
writing. 

His house was here and the 
furniture and the manuscript and 
the crudely carpentered shelf 
that held his books, but it was 
his home no longer, and now 
could never be again. And that 
wasn't all, he thought. The Earth, 
the original human earth — the 
earth with the capital "E" — was 
his home no more. 

He'd go and see Eb first and 
after he had seen Eb, he'd go to 
his own house and get the manuscript. 

He. could give the manuscript 
to Ann; she would keep it safely 
for him. 

On second thought, he'd have 
to find some other place, for he 
didn't want to see Ann — although 
that was not precisely the truth. 
He did want to see her, but knew 
he shouldn't, now that there lay 
between them the knowledge that 
he and she were part of a single 
life. 

He pulled the car to a stop in 
front of Eb's house and sat there 
for a moment looking at it, wondering at the neatness of the 
house and yard. Eb lived alone 
without wife or child, and it was 
not usual that a man alone would 
keep a place so tidy. 

He'd spend just a minute with 



Eb, would tell him what had happened, what was "going on, make 
arrangements to keep in touch 
with him, and learn from him 
whatever news might be worth 
knowing. 

He closed the car door and 
went across the walk, fumbling at 
the latch of the gate that opened 
to the yard. Moonlight came 
down through the trees and 
splotched the walk with light. 
He followed it to the porch, and 
now, for the first time, he noticed 
that there were no lights burning 
in the house. 

He rapped on the door, knowing from poker sessions and other 
infrequent visits that Eb had no 
doorbell. 

There was no answer. He waited and finally rapped again and 
then turned from the door and 
went down the walk. Maybe Eb 
was still down at the garage, putting in some overtime on an 
urgent repair job. or he might be 
down at the tavern, having a 
quick one with the boys. 

He'd sit out in the car and 
wait for Eb. It probably wouldn't 
be safe to go down into the village business section where he'd 
be recognized. 

A voice asked, "You looking 
for Eb?" 

"17ICKERS spun around to' ward the voice. It was the 
next door neighbor, he saw, 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



131 



standing at the fence. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "I was 
looking for him." 

He was trying to remember 
who lived next to Eb. Someone 
he knew, someone who might 
recognize him? 

"I'm an old friend of his," 
Vickers added. "Just passing 
through. Thought I'd stop and 
say hello." 

The man had stepped through 
a break in the fence and was 
coming across the lawn. 

"How well did you know Eb?" 

"Not too well," said Vickers. 
"Haven't seen him in ten or fifteen years. We used to be kids 
together." 

"Eb is dead," the neighbor 
said. 

"Dead!" 

The neighbor spat. "He was 
one of those damned mutants." 

"No," protested Vickers. "No, 
he couldn't be!" 

"He was. We had another one. 
but he got away. We always had 
a suspicion Eb might have tipped him off." 

And in the bitterness and 
hatred of the neighbor's words, 
Vickers felt the sheer terror of 
the strange dog cornered by the 
local pack. 

The mob killed Eb and they 
would kill him if they knew he 
had returned to town. And in 
just a little while they'd know, 
for any minute now the neighbor 



would recognize him — now . he 
knew finally who ti the neighbor 
was, the beefy individual who 
worked at the meat counter in 
the town's one chain store. His 
name was — It didn't really matter. 

"Seems to me," the neighbor 
said, "I've seen you somewhere." 

"You must be mistaken. I've 
never been East before." 

"Your voice ..." 

Vickers struck with all the 
power he had, starting the first 
down low and bringing it up in 
a vicious arc, twisting his body 
to line it up behind the blow, to 
put the weight of his body behind it. 

He hit the man in the face and 
the impact of flesh on flesh, of 
bone on bone, made a whiplike 
sound and the man went down. 

JAY VICKERS did not wait. 
He went racing for the gate. 
He almost tore the car door from 
its hinges getting in. He thumbed 
the starter savagely and trod 
down on the gas and the car 
leaped down the street, spraying 
the bushes with gravel thrown 
by its frightened wheels. 

His arm was numb from the 
force of the blow he'd struck. 
When he held his hand down 
in front of the lighted dash panel, 
he saw that his knuckles were 
lacerated and slowly dripping 
blood. 



132 




 



He had a few minutes' start, 
for once the neighbor was on his 
feet, once he could reach a phone, 
they'd begin hunting him, screaming through the night on whining 
tires, with shotgun and rope and 
rifle. 

He had to get away. Now he 
was on his own. Eb was dead, 
shot down or strung up or kicked 
to death, and Eb had been his 
contact. 

Now there was no one but 
himself and Ann. 

And Ann, God willing, didn't 
even know that she was a mutant. 

He struck the main highway 
and swung down the valley. 

There was an old abandoned 
road some ten miles down the 
highway, he remembered. A man 
could duck a car in there and 
wait until it was safe to double 
back again, although doubling 
back probably wouldn't be too 
safe. 

Maybe it would be better to 
take to the hills and hide out 
until the hunt blew over. 

No, he told himself, there was 
nothing safe. 

And he had no time to waste. 

He had to get to Crawford, 
had to head Crawford off the 
best way that he could. And he 
had to do it alone. 

' I ^HE abandoned road was 
there, halfway up a long, 
steep hill. He wheeled the car 



into it and bumped along it for 
a hundred feet or so, then got 
out and walked back hastily to 
the road. 

Hidden behind a clump of 
trees, he watched cars go screaming past, but there was no way 
to know if any of them might be 
hunting him. 

Then a rickety old truck came 
slowly up the hill, engine howling with the climb. 

He watched it, an idea growing 
in his mind. 

When it came abreast, he saw 
that it was closed in the back 
with a high end gate. 

He went out into the traffic 
lane and raced after it, caught 
up with it and leaped. His fingers gripped the top of the end 
gate and he heaved himself clear 
of the road, scrambled up and 
clambered over the boxes stacked inside the truck. 

He huddled there, staring out 
at the road behind him. 

A hunted animal, he thought; 
hunted . by men who once had 
been his friends. 

After ten mites or so, someone stopped the truck. 

A voice asked: "You see anyone up the road? Walking, maybe?" 

' 'Hell, no," the truck driver 
said. "I ain't seen a soul." 

"We're looking for a mutant. 
Figure he must have ditched his 
car." 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



133 



"I thought we had all of them 
cleaned out." 

"Not all. Maybe he took to the 
hills. If he did, we've got him — 
unless he \ disappears the way 
they always do when, they're 
warned." 

"Your truck'll be stopped 
again," another voice said. "We 
phoned ahead both ways. They 
got road blocks set up." 

"I'll keep my eyes peeled," the 
driver replied. 

"You got a gun?" 
-"No." 

"Well, keep watching, anyway." 

When the truck rolled on, 
Vickers saw the two men standing in the road. The moonlight 
glinted harshly on their rifles. 

He set to work cautiously, moving some of the boxes, making 
himself a hideout. 

He needn't have bothered. 

The truck was stopped at three 
other road blocks. At none of 
them did anyone do more than 
flash a light inside the truck. 
They seemed convinced that 
they wouldn't find a mutant as 
easily as finding him hidden 
among crates. 

Nor would they, for Vickers 
would have vanished to Earth 
No. 2 the instant they closed in. 
But he was glad he didn't have 
to. 

This was the quickest way to 
get to Ann Carter. 



TTE knew what he would find, 
but he went there just the 
same, because it was the only 
place he could think of where he 
might establish contact. But the 
huge show window was broken 
and the miniature house that had 
stood on display was smashed as 
utterly as if it had stood in a 
cyclone's path. 

The mob had done its work. 

He stood in front of the gaping window and stared at the 
wreckage of the model house and 
remembered the day that he and 
Ann had stopped there on their 
way to the bus station. The 
house, he recalled, had had a flying ducks weather vane and a 
sundial had stood in the yard and 
there had been a car standing in 
the driveway, but the car had 
disappeared completely. Dragged out into the street, probably, 
and smashed as his own car had 
been in that little Illinois town. 

He turned away from the window and walked slowly down the 
street. It had been foolish to go 
to the show room, he told himself, but there had been a slim 
chance — as he knew all his 
chances were. 

He turned a corner and there, 
in a dusty square across the 
street, a good -si zed crowd had 
gathered and was listening to 
someone who had climbed a park 
bench and was talking to them. 

Idly, Vickers walked across the 



134 




 



street, stopped opposite the 
crowd. 

The man on the park bench 
had taken off his coat and rolled 
up his sleeves and loosened his 
tie. He talked almost conversationally, yet his words carried 
clear across the park to where 
Vickers stood. . 

"When the bombs come," asked the man, "what will happen 
then? They say don't be afraid. 
They say stay on your jobs and 
don't be afraid. But what will 
they do when the bombs arrive? 
Will they help you then?" 

He paused and the crowd was 
tense, tense in a terrible silence. 
You could feel the knotted muscles that clamped the jaws tight 
shut and the hand that squeezed 
the heart until the body turned 
all cold. And you could sense, 
the fear — 

"'X1HEY will not help," the 
speaker told them, speaking 
slowly and deliberately. "They 
will not help you, for you will 
be past all help. You will be 
dead, my friends. Dead by the 
tens of thousands. Dead and 
restless atoms. My friends, why 
don't you heed? The other world 
awaits. The poor go first. The 
poor and desperate, the ones for 
which this world you stand on 
has no further use. The only 
way you can go is in utter poverty, by quitting your jobs and 



giving away all your possessions. 

"In that other world there are 
no bombs. There is a beginning 
over, a starting over again. An 
entire new world, almost exactly 
like this world, with trees and 
grass and fertile land and game 
upon the hills and fish teeming in 
the rivers. The kind of place you 
dream of. And there is peace." 

There were sirens screaming, 
getting closer. 

Vickers stepped off the sidewalk and dashed across the 
street. 

A squad car roared around a 
corner, skidding and whipping to 
get straightened out, its tires 
screaming on the pavement, its 
siren a-wail as if in agony. 

Almost at the curb, Vickers 
stumbled and went sprawling. 
Instinctively, he pulled himself 
to hands and knees and flicked a 
sidewise glance to see the squad 
car, bearing down upon him. He 
knew he could not make it, that 
before he could get his feet beneath him, the car would crush 
him. 

A hand came down out of nowhere and fastened on his arm 
and he felt himself catapulting 
off the street and across the sidewalk. 

Another squad car came around 
the corner, skidding and with 
flattened tires protesting, almost 
as if the first had returned to 
make a second entrance. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



The scattered crowd was running in terror. 

The hand tugged at his arm 
and hauled him erect and Vickers 
saw his benefactor for the first 
time, a man in a ragged sweater, 
with an old jagged knife-mark 
across his cheek. 

"Quick," said the man, the 
knife-mark writhing as he spoke, 
teeth flashing in the whiskershadowed face. 

He shoved Vickers into a 
narrow alleyway between two 
buildings and Vickers sprinted, 
shoulders hunched, between the 
walls of brick that rose on either 
side. 

He heard the man panting 
along behind him. 

"To your right," said the man. 
"A door." 

\fICKERS grasped the knob 
"and the door swung open into 
a darkened hall. 

The man stepped in beside him 
and closed the door and they 
stood together in the darkness, 
the sound of their gasping beating like an erratic heart in the 
confining darkness. 

"That was close," the man 
said. "Those cops are getting on 
the ball. You no more than start 
a meeting and . . ." 

He did not finish the sentence. 
Instead he reached out and 
touched Vickers on the arm. 

"Follow me," he said. "Be 



careful. There are stairs," 

Vickers followed, feeling his 
way down the creaky stairs, with 
the musty smell of cellar growing stronger with each step. 

At the bottom of the stairway, 
the man pushed aside a hanging 
blanket and they stepped into a 
dimly lighted room. There was 
an old, broken-down piano in one 
corner and a pile of boxes in 
another and a table in the center, 
around which four men and two 
women sat. 

One of the men said, "We 
heard the sirens." 

Scar-face nodded. "Charley 
was just going good. The crowd 
was getting ready to start shouting." 

"Who's your friend, George?" 
asked another. 

"He was running," said George. 
"Police car almost got him." 

They looked at Vickers with 
interest. 

"What's your name, friend?" 
asked George. 

Vickers told them. 

"Is he all right?" asked somebody. 

"He was there," said George. 
"He was running." 

"But is it safe . . ." 

"He's all right," George insisted, but Vickers noted that he 
said it too vehemently, too stubbornly, as if he now realized that 
he might have made a mistake in 
bringing a total stranger here. 



136 




 



"Have a drink," offered one of 
the men. He shoved a bottle 
across the table toward Vickers. 

Vickers sat down in a chair 
and took the bottle. 

One of the women, the betterlooking of the two, said to him, 
"My name is Sally." 

Vickers said, "I'm glad to know 
you, Sally." 

He looked around the table. 
None of the rest of them seemed 
ready to introduce themselves. 

He lifted the bottle and drank. 
It was cheap stuff. He choked a 
little on it. 

OALLY said, "You an activist?" 
^ "I beg your pardon?" 

"An activist or purist?" 

"He's an activist," said George. 
"He was right in there with the 
rest of them." 

Vickers could see that George 
was sweating a little, afraid he 
had made a mistake. 

"He sure as hell doesn't look 
like one," one of the men stated. 

"I'm an activist," said Vickers, 
because he could see that was 
what they wanted him to be. 

"He's like me," Sally declared. 
' He's an activist by principle, but 
a purist by preference. Isn't 
that right?" she asked Vickers. 

"Yes," said Vickers. "Yes, I 
guess that's it." 

He took another drink. 

"What's your period?" Sally 
asked. 



"My period?" repeated Vickers blankly. "Oh, yes, my period." 

And he remembered the white, 
intense face of Mrs. Leslie asking 
him what historic period he 
thought would be the most exciting. 

"Charles the Second," he said. 

"You were a little slow on that 
one," said one of the men suspiciously. 

"I fooled around some," Vickers evaded. "Dabbled, you know. 
Took me quite a while to find the 
period I liked." 

"And then you settled on 
Charles the Second," Sally said. 

"That's right." 

"Mine," Sally told him, "is 
Aztec." 

"But Aztec . . 

"It really isn't fair, is it? 
There's so little known about the 
Aztecs. But that way I can make 
it up as I go along. It's so much 
more fun that way." 

GEORGE said, "It's plain 
damn foolishness. Maybe it 
was all right to piddle around 
with diaries and pretend you were 
someone else when there was 
nothing else to do. But now there 
is something else to do." 

"George is right," nodded the 
other woman. 

"You activists are the ones 
who're wrong," Sally argued. 
"The basic thing in Pretentionism is the ability to lift yourself 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



137 



out of your present time and 
space, to project yourself into 
another era." 

"Now, listen here," said 
George. "I . . ." 

"Oh, I agree that we must 
work for this other world. It's 
the kind of opportunity we wanted all along. But that doesn't 
mean we have to give up . . ." 

"Cut it out," said one of the 
men, the big fellow at the table's 
end. "This ain't no place for gabbling." 

Sally said to Vickers, "We're 
having a meeting tonight. Would 
you like to come?" 

He hesitated. In the dim light, 
he could see that all of them were 
looking at him. 

"Sure," he said. "It would be 
a pleasure." 

He reached for the bottle and 
took another drink, then passed 
it on to George. 

"There won't be anybody stirring for a while," said George. 
"Not until the cops have a chance 
to get cooled off a bit." 

He took a drink and passed the 
bottle on. 

fT^HE meeting was just getting 
under way when Sally and 
Vickers arrived. 

"Will George be here?" asked 
Vickers. „, 

Sally laughed a little. "George 
here? George is a roughneck. A 
red-hot. A born organizer. How 



he escaped communism is more 
than I'll ever know." 
"And you?" 

"We are the propagandists," 
she said. "We go to meetings. We 
talk to people. We get them interested. We do the missionary 
work and get the converts who'll 
go out and preach. When we get 
them, we turn them over to people 
like George." 

"I see." 

The dowager sitting at the 
table rapped with the letter opener she was using as a gavel. 

"Please," she said. Her voice 
was aggrieved. "This meeting 
will come to order." 

Vickers held a chair for Sally, 
then took one for himself. The 
others in the room were quieting 
down. 

The room, Vickers saw, was 
really two — the living room and 
the dining room, with the French 
doors between them thrown open 
so that in effect they became one 
room. 

Upper middle class, he thought. 
Just swank enough not to be 
vulgar, but failing the grandeur 
of the really rich. Real paintings 
on the wall and a Provincial fireplace and furniture that was of 
some period or other, although he 
couldn't name it. 

He glanced at the faces around 
him and tried to place them. An 
executive type over there — a manufacturer's representative, he'd 



138 




 



guess. And that one who needed 
a haircut might be a painter 
or a writer, although not- a successful one. And the woman with 
the iron-gray hair and the outdoor tan was more than likely a 
member of some riding set. 

But it did not matter, he knew. 
Here it was upper middle class 
in an apartment house with its 
doorman uniformed, while across 
the city there would be another 
meeting in a tenement which had 
never known a doorman. And in 
the little villages and the smaller 
cities they would meet perhaps at 
the banker's house or at the barber's house. And in each instance 
someone would rap on the table 
and say would the meeting come 
to order, please. At most of the 
meetings, too, there would be a 
woman or a man like Sally, waiting to talk to the members, hoping to make converts. 

T^HE dowager was saying, 
"Miss Stanhope is the first 
member on our list to read tonight." 

Then she sat back, contented, 
now that she had them finally 
quieted down and the meeting 
started. • 

Miss Stanhope stood up and 
she was, Vickers saw, the personification of frustrated female 
flesh and spirit. She was forty, 
he would guess, and manless, and 
she would hold down a job that 



in another fifteen years would 
leave her financially independent 
— and yet she was running from 
a specter, seeking sanctuary behind the cloak of another personality from the past. 

Her voice was clear and strong, 
but with a tendency to simper, 
and she read with her chin held 
high, which made her neck appear more scrawny than it was, 
in the manner of an elocution 
student. 

"My period, you may remember," she said, "is the American 
Civil War, with its locale in the 
South." 

She read: 

"Oct. 13, 1862 — Mrs. Hampton 
sent her carriage for me today, 
with old Ned, one of her few remaining servants, driving, since 
most of the others have run off, 
leaving her quite destitute of 
help, a situation in which many 
of us also find oursefves . . ." 

Running away, thought Vickers, running away to the age of 
crinoline and chivalry, to a war 
from which time had swept away 
the blood and agony and made 
of its pitiful participants, both 
men and women, figures of pure 
romantic nostalgia. 

She read: "... Isabella was 
there and I was glad to see her. 
It had been years since we 'had 
met, that time back there, in Ala^ 
bama . . ." 

Fleeing, of course. And yet a 



RING AROUND THE SUN 




fleeing now turned into a readymade instrument to preach the 
gospel of that other world, the 
peaceful second world behind the 
scarred and tired Earth. 

No more than three weeks and 
they're already organized, Vickers thought, with the Georges to 
do the shouting and the running 
and occasionally the dying, and 



Sallys to do undercover work. 

And yet, even with the other 
world before them, even with the 
promise of the kind of life they 
seek, they still cling to the old 
nostalgic ritual of the magnoliascented past. It was the mark of 
suspicion upon them, refusing to 
give up the dream through fear 
that the actuality, if they reach




cd for it, would dissolve beneath 
their fingertips. 

Miss Stanhope read on: "J sat 
for an hour beside' old Mrs. 
Hampton's bed, reading Vanity 
Fair, a book of which she is fond, 
having read it herself, and having 
had it read to her since the onset 
of her infirmity, more times than 
she can remember."

"C<VEN if some of them still 
clung to the scented dream, 
there were others, the Georges 
among them, who would fight 
for the promise that they sensed 
in the second world. They would 
spread the word and they would 
flee the police when the sirens 
sounded and they would hide in 
the dark cellars and come out 
again when the police were gone. 

The world is safe, thought 
Vickers. It has been placed in 
hand that will guard and cherish 
it, that can do no other than 
guard and cherish it. 

Miss Stanhope read on and the 
old dowager sat behind the table, 
nodding her head a little drowsily, but with a firm grip still upon 
the letter opener, and all the 
others were listening, some of 
them politely, but most with consuming interest. When the reading was done, they would ask 
questions on points of research 
and pose other matters to be 
clarified and would make suggestions for the revision of the diary 
and would compliment Miss 
Stanhope upon the brilliance of 
her work. Then someone else 
would stand up and read about 
life in some other time and place 
and once again all of them would 
sit and listen and repeat the performance. 

Vickers felt the futility of it, 
the dread, dead hopelessness. It 
was as if the room were filled with 



the spice scent of many dusty 
years. 

When Miss Stanhope had finished and the room was stirring 
with the questions asked and the 
questions to be asked, he rose 
quietly from his chair and went 
out to the street. 

The stars were shining. 

Tomorrow he would go to see 
Ann Carter. 

And that was wrong, he knew. 
He shouldn't see her. 

XLIV 

TIE rang the bell and waited. 
XX When he heard her footsteps 
coming across the floor, he knew 
he should turn from the door and 
run. He had no right to come here 
and he knew he shouldn't have. 
There was no reason why he 
should see her at all, for the 
dream of her was dead as the 
dream of Kathleen. 

But he had had to come, literally had to. He had paused twice 
before the door of the apartment 
building and then had turned 
around and gone away again. 
This time he had not turned back, 
could not, but had gone in and 
now here he was, before her door, 
listening to the sound of footsteps 
coming toward him. 

And what, he wondered wildly, 
would he say to her when the 
door was opened? What would 
he do then? Go in as if nothing 



142 




 



at all had happened, as if they 
each were the same person they 
had been the last time they had 
met? 

Should he tell her she was a 
mutant and, more than that, an 
android, a manufactured woman? 

The door came open and she 
was a woman, as lovely as he 
remembered her, and she reached 
out a hand and drew him in and 
closed the door behind them and 
stood with her back against it. 

"Jay," she said. "Jay Vickers." 

He tried to speak, but he 
couldn't. He only stood there 
looking at her and thinking: It's 
a lie. It can't be true. 

"What happened. Jay? You 
said you would call me." 

He held out his arms, fighting 
not to, and she made a quick, 
almost desperate motion and was 
in them. He held her close against 
him and it was if the two of them 
stood in the final consolation of 
a misery which each had believed 
the other did not know. 

"I thought at first you were 
just a little crazy," she told him. 
"Remembering some of the things 
you said over the phone from that 
Wisconsin town, I was almost 
sure there was something wrong 
with you — that you'd gone off 
the beam. Then I got to remembering things, strange little things 
you had done or said or written 
and . . ." 

"Take it easy, Ann," he said. 



"You don't need to tell me." 

"Jay, have you ever wondered 
if you were quite human? If there 
might not be something in you 
that wasn't quite the usual pattern — something un human." 

"Yes," he said. "I've often 
wondered that." 

"I 'm sure you aren't. Not 
quite human, I mean. And that's 
all right. Because I'm not quite 
human, either." 

"CREELING her arms around 
him. he knew finally that 
here, clinging to one another, were 
two wan souls, lost and friendless 
in a sea of humanity. Neither of 
them had anyone but the other. 
Even if there were no love between them, they still must be as 
one and stand against the world. 

The telephone buzzed at them 
from its place upon the end table 
and they scarcely heard it. 

"I love you, Ann," he said, and 
a part of his brain that was not a 
part of him, but a cold, detached 
observer that stood off to one 
side, reminded him that he had 
known he could not love her, 
that it was impossible and immoral and preposterous to love 
someone who was closer than a 
sister, whose life had once been 
a part of his own and once more 
would blend with his life into 
another personality that might 
be unaware of them. 

"I remembered," Ann told him 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



143 



in a vague and distant voice. 
"And I haven't got it straight. 
Maybe you can help me get it 
straight." 

He asked, lips stiff with apprehension, "What did you remember, Ann?" 

"A walk I had with someone. 
I've tried, but I can't recall his 
name, although I'd know his face, 
even after' all these years. We 
walked down a valley, from a big 
brick house that stood on a hill. 
We walked down the valley and 
it was springtime because the 
wild crab apple blossoms were 
in bloom and there were singing 
birds and the funny thing about 
that walk is that I know I never 
took it. but I remember it. How 
can you remember something. 
Jay, when you know it never 
happened?" 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"Imagination, maybe. Something 
that you read somewhere." 

But this was it, he knew. This 
was the proof of what he had 
suspected. 

There were three of them , 
Flanders had said, three androids 
made out of one human life. The 
three of them had to be himself 
and Flanders and Ann Carter. 
Ann remembered the enchanted 
valley as he remembered it — but 
because he was a man, he had 
walked with a girl by the name 
of Kathleen Preston, and since 
Ann was a woman, she had walk


ed with a man whose name she 
could not recall. And when and 
if she did recall it, of course it 
would be wrong. For if he had 
walked with anyone, it had not 
been with a girl named Kathleen 
Preston, but a girl with some 
other name. 

"And that's not all," said Ann. 
"I know what other people think. 

"Please, Ann," he said. 

"I try not to know what they 
think, now that I realize that I 
can do it. I've been doing it, 
more or less unconsciously, all 
the time for years. Anticipating 
what people were about to say. 
Getting the jump on them. 
Knowing their objections before 
they even spoke them. Knowing 
what would appeal to them. I've 
been a good businesswoman, Jay, 
and that may be why I am. I 
can get into other people's minds. 
I did only the other day. When 
I first suspected that I could do 
it, I tried deliberately, just to 
see if I could or was imagining 
it. And I could. Jay, I could!" 

¥TE held her close and thought: 
Ann's one of the telepaths, 
one of those who can go out to 
the stars. 

"What are we, Jay?" she asked. 
"Tell me what we are." 

The telephone shrieked at 
them. 

"Later," he said. "It's not so 



144 




 



terribly frightening. In some ways 
it's wonderful. I came back because I loved you, Ann. I tried 
to stay away, but I couldn't. Because it isn't right . . ." 

"It's right," she almost sang. 
"Oh. Jay, it's the Tightest thing 
there ever was. I prayed that you 
would come back to me again. 
When I knew there was something wrong, I was afraid you 
wouldn't — that you might not be 
able to, that something awful 
might have happened to you. I 
prayed and the prayer was wrong 
because prayer was strange to 
me and I felt hypocritical and 
awful . . ." 

*T*HE ringing was a persistent 
snarl. 

"The phone," she said. 

He let her go and she walked 
to the davenport and sat down 
and took the receiver out of its 
cradle, while he stood and looked 
at the room and tried to bring it 
and Ann into focus with his 
memory. 

"It's for you," she said. 

"For me?" 

"Yes. Did anyone know you 
were coming here?" 

He shook his head, but took 
the receiver and stood with it in 
his hand, trying to guess who 
might be calling him and why. 
Wondering, he knew that he was 
scared, felt the sweat break out 
beneath his armpits and trickle 



down his ribs, because it could 
only be one person on the phone. 

A voice -said: "This is the Neanderthaler, Vickers." 

"Club and all?" asked Vickers. 

"Break out your spear," said 
Crawford. "We have a bone to 
chew." 

"At your office?" 

"There's a cab outside. It is 
waiting for you." 

"How long have you been 
tracking me?" 

Crawford chuckled. "Ever since 
Chicago. We have the country 
plastered with our analyzers." 

"Picking up much stuff?" 

"A few strays here and there." 

"Still confident about that secret weapon?" 

"Sure, I'm confident, but . . ." 

"Go ahead. You're talking to a 
friend." 

"I have to hand it to you, 
Vickers. Get over here fast." 

He hung up. Vickers took the 
receiver down from his ear and 
stared at it a moment, then 
placed it in the cradle. 

"That was Crawford," he said 
to Ann. "He wants to talk to 
me." 

"Is everything all right, Jay?" 
"Fine." 

"You'll come back?" 
"Well, of course." 
"You know what you are doing?" 

"Oh, yes," said Vickers. "I 
know what I'm doing now."

XLV 

CRAWFORD motioned to the 
chair beside the desk. Vickers 
saw with a start that it was the 
same chair he'd sat in when he'd 
come to the office, only weeks 
ago, with Ann. 

"It's nice seeing you again," 
said Crawford. "I'm glad we can 
get together." 

"Your plans must be going 
well," Vickers said. "You are 
more affable than when I saw you 
last." 

"I'm always affable. Worried 
and afraid sometimes, but always 
affable." 

"You haven't picked up Ann 
Carter." 

Crawford shook his head. 
"There's no reason to. Not yet." 

"But you're watching her." 

"We're watching all of you. 
The few that are left." 

"Any time we want to, we can 
come unwatched." 

"I don't doubt it," Crawford 
admitted, "but why do you stick 
around? If I were a mutant, I 
wouldn't." 

"Because we have you licked 
and you're the one who knows 
it," said Vickers, wishing he were 
half as confident as he hoped he 
sounded. 

"We can start a war. All we 
have to do is lift a finger and the 
shooting begins." 

"You won't start it." 



. "You played your hand too 
hard. You're pushing us into war 
against our will as a last defense." 

"You mean the other world 
idea?" 

"Exactly," Crawford said. 

He sat and stared at Vickers 
with the pale blue bullet eyes 
peering out unemotionally from 
the rolls of flesh. 

"What do you think we'll do?" 
he asked. "Stand still and let 
you steamroller us? You tried 
the gadgets and we stopped them 
with, I admit, rather violent 
methods. So you tried an approach, a sort of religion, a piece 
of park bench fanaticism — tell 
me, Vickers, what do you call 
this business?" 

"The blunt truth," said Vickers. 

"No matter what it is, it's good. 
Too good. It'll take_ a war to 
stop it." 

"You'd call it subversive, I 
suppose." 

"It is subversive," Crawford 
said. "Already, just a few days 
since it started, it has shown results. People quitting their jobs, 
walking away from their homes, 
throwing away their money. 
Poverty, they said, that was the 
key to the other world. What 
kind of gag have you cooked up, 
Vickers?" 

"What happens to these people? The ones who quit their 
jobs and threw away their money 



146 




 



— have you kept a check on what 
happens to them?" 

CRAWFORD leaned forward 
in his chair. "That's the thing 
that scares us. Those people disappeared before we could round 
them up.'* 

"They went to the other 
world," said Vickers. 

"I don't know where they went, 
but I know what will happen if 
we let it continue. Our workers 
will leave us, a few at first and 
then more and more . . 

"If you want to turn on that 
war, start reaching for the button." 

"We won't let you do this to 
us," Crawford said. "We will stop 
you somehow. I told you about 
the analyzers. Well, they're everywhere. In railroad terminals, 
bus depots, hotel lobbies, eating 
joints . . ." 

"I thought as much. That's how 
you picked me up." 

"I warned you once before. 
Don't despise us because we're 
merely human, With an organization of world industry, you can 
do a lot of things and do them 
awfully fast." 

"You outsmart yourself," said 
Vickers. "You've found out a lot 
of things from those analyzers 
that you didn't want to know." 

"Like what?" 

"A lot of your industrialists 
and bankers and the others who 



are in your organization are really 
the mutants you are fighting." 

"I said I had to hand it to you. 
Would you mind telling me how 
you planted them?" 

"We didn't plant them, Crawford." 

"You didn't . . ." ■ 

"Let's take it from the start," 
said Vickers. "Let me ask you 
what a mutant is." 

"Why, I suppose he's an ordinary man who has some extra 
talents, an understanding of certain things that the rest of us 
can't grasp." 

"And suppose a man were a 
mutant and didn't know he was, 
but regarded himself as an ordinary man, what then? Where 
would he wind up? Doctor, lawyer, beggarman, thief? He'd wind 
up at the top of the heap. He'd 
be an eminent doctor or a smart 
attorney or an artist or a highly 
successful editor or writer. He 
might also be an industrialist or 
banker." 

The blue bullets of the eyes 
stared out from Crawford's face. 

"You," said Vickers, "have 
been heading up one of the finest 
group of mutants in the world today, men we couldn't touch because they were tied too closely 
to the normal world." 

"I know I have." 

"And what are you going to do 
about it, Crawford?" 

"Not a single thing. I'm not 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



147 



going to tell them." 
"Then I will." 

"No, you won't," said Crawford. "Because you, personally, 
are washed up. How do you think 
you've lived this long in spite of 
all the analyzers we have? I've 
let you, that's how." 

"You claimed you wanted to 
make a deal." 

"Not any more. You were an 
asset once. You're a danger 
now." 

"You're throwing me to the 
wolves?" 

"That's just what I'm doing. 
Good day, Mr. Vickers. It was 
nice knowing you." 

Vickers rose from the chair. 
"I'll see you again." 

"That," said Crawford, "is 
something I doubt." 

XLVI 




OING down the lift, Vickers 
thought furiously. 



It would take Crawford a little while to spread the word that 
he was unprotected, that anyone 
could pot him like a sitting duck. 

If it had only been himself, it 
would have been an easy matter, 
but Ann was involved. 

Ann, without a doubt, would 
become fair game, too, for now 
the chips were down and Crawford wasn't the kind of man who 
would play according to rules. 

Vickers had to reach Ann. 



Reach and tell her fast, keep her 
from asking questions and make 
her understand. 

At the ground floor, he stepped 
out with the other passengers and 
as he walked away, he saw the 
operator leave the elevator open 
and dash for a phone booth. 

Reporting me, he thought. 
There was an analyzer on the 
elevator and it made some sort of 
a signal that would go undetected 
to anyone but the operator. And 
there were other analyzers everywhere, Crawford had said, in 
railroad terminals and bus stations and eating places — anywhere that a man might go. 

Once one of the analyzers spotted a mutant, the word would be 
called in somewhere — to an exterminator squad, perhaps — and 
they would hunt the mutant 
down. Maybe they spotted him 
with portable analyzers, or maybe there were other ways to spot 
him, and once they spotted him, 
it would be all over. 

All over because the mutant 
would not know, because he 
would have no warning of the 
death that tracked him. Given a 
moment's notice, a moment to 
concentrate, he could disappear, 
as the mutants had disappeared 
at will when Crawford's men had 
tried to track them down for interview and parley. 

What was it Crawford had 
said? "You ring the bell and 




 



wait. You sit in a room and wait." 

But now the mutants seldom 
had a chance since they had no 
warning. 

Except that always before, 
when Jay Vickers had been spotted, he'd been known as one of 
the few who were not to be molested — he and Ann and maybe 
one or two others. 

But now it would be different. 
He was only another mutant, a 
hunted rat, just like all the 
others. 

TJE reached the sidewalk outside the building and stood 
for a moment, looking up and 
down the street. 

A cab, he thought, but there 
would be an analyzer in it. There 
would be analyzers everywhere. 
There must be one at Ann's 
apartment building. How else 
could Crawford have known so 
quickly that he had arrived 
there ? 

There was no way he could 
duck the analyzers, no way to 
hide or prevent them from knowing where he might be going. 

He stepped to the sidewalk's 
edge and hailed a cruising cab. It 
drew up and he stepped inside 
and gave the driver the address. 

The man threw a startled backward look at him. 

"You won't be in any trouble," 
said Vickers, "as long as you 
don't try anything." 



"It's all right, chum," the driver nervously told him. "I won't 
try a thing." 

"That's just fine," said Vickers. "Now let's go." 

He watched the blocks slide 
by, keeping an eye on the driver, 
watching for any motions that 
might be signals that there was 
a mutant in the taxi. The man 
made none and Vickers gradually 
relaxed. 

A thought struck him. What 
if they had gone immediately to 
Ann's apartment and had found 
her there and were waiting for 
him now? 

It was a risk, he decided, that 
he'd have to take a chance on. 

JXiHE cab stopped in front of 
the building and Vickers 
leaped out. The driver gunned 
the car, not waiting for the fare. 

Vickers ran toward the door, 
ignored the elevator, and went 
pounding up the stairs. 

He reached Ann's door and 
seized the knob and turned it, 
but the door was locked. He rang 
the bell and nothing happened. 
He rang it again and again. Then 
he backed to the opposite wall 
and hurled his body forward 
across the corridor, smashing at 
the door. He felt it give as the 
hinges were loosened. He backed 
up again. The third try and the 
door ripped away and sent him 
sprawling. 



RING AROUND THE SUN 



149 



"Ann!" he shouted, leaping up. 

There was no answer. 

He went running through the 
rooms and found no one there. 

He .stood for a moment, sweat 
breaking out on him. 

Ann was gone! There was little 
time left to them and Ann was 
gone! 

He plunged out the door and 
went tearing down the stairs. 

When he reached the sidewalk, 
the cars were pulling up, three of 
them, one behind the other, and 
there were two more across the 
street. 

Men were piling out of it, men 
who carried guns. 

He tried to swing around to 
get back into the door again and 
bumped into someone. It was 
Ann, arms filled with shopping 
bags, and from one of the bags, 
he saw, protruded the leafy top 
of a bunch of celery. 

"Jay." she said, "what's going 
on? Who are all these men?" 

"Quick," he ordered, "get into 
my mind. The way you did the 
others. The way you know how 
people think." 

"But . . ." 

"Quick!" 

He felt her come into his mind, 
groping for his thoughts, fastening onto them. 

Something hit the stone wall 
of the building just above their 
heads and went twisting skyward 
with a shriek of- tortured metal. 



"Hang on," he said. "We're 
getting out of here." 

He closed his eyes and willed 
himself to the other earth, with 
all the urgency and will he could 
muster. He felt the tremor of 
Ann's mind and then he slipped 
and fell. He hit his head on 
something hard and stars wheeled 
inside his skull and something 
tore at his hand and something 
else fell on top of him. 

WHEN the stars cleared away, 
he heard the sound of wind 
blowing in the trees and there 
were no buildings. 

He lay flat upon his back, at 
the foot of a gray granite boulder. 
A bag of groceries, with the top 
of a bunch of celery sticking out 
of it, lay upon his stomach. 
He sat up. 
"Ann," he called. 
"Here I am," she said. 
"You all right?" 
"Physically, yes, but not mentally. What happened? Where 
did we go to?" 

"We fell off that boulder," 
Vickers told her. 

He stood up and reached down 
a hand to help her to her feet. 

"But the boulder, Jay! Where 
I live?" 

"We're in the second world," 
said Vickers. 

They stood together and looked 
across the land — wild, desolate, 
wooded, with scattered rocks and 



150 




 



granite ledges sticking from the 
hilt slopes. 

"The second world," repeated 
Ann dazedly. "That crazy stuff 
that's been in the papers?" 

Vickers nodded gravely. 
"There's nothing crazy about it, 
Ann. It exists." 

"I'll take your word for it." 
She paused to grow practical. 
"Well, we brought our dinner 
with us. Help me pick up these 
groceries." 

Vickers got down on hands and 
knees to chase down the potatoes that had escaped from the 
sack. It had split wide open in 
the tumble from the boulder. 

XLVII 

IT was Manhattan as it must 
have appeared before the 
white man came, finally to build 
upon it the Man-made half-wonder, half-monstrosity. But now it 
was a world unspoiled. 

"And yet," said Vickers, "there 
must be something here. The mutants would have to have some 
sort of supply depot to store the 
stuff they'd want to funnel to 
New York." 

"And if they haven't?" 
He looked at her and grinned 
wryly. "How are you at travel?" 
"All the way to Chicago?" 
"Farther than Chicago," he 
told her. "On foot. Although we 
might rig up a raft when we hit 



a westward-flowing river." 

"There'd be other mutant centers." 

"I suppose there would be, but 
we might not be lucky enough to 
stumble on one of them." 

She shook her head at him. 
"This is all so strange." 

"Not strange," he said. "Just 
sudden. If we'd had the time, I'd 
have explained — prepared you — 
but we didn't." 

"J a y> they were shooting at 
us." 

Vickers nodded grimly. "They 
play for keeps." 

"But they're human beings, 
Jay. Just like us." 

"Not like us," said Vickers. 
"Only human. That's the trouble 
with them. Being human in this 
day isn't quite enough." He 
tossed two or three pieces of 
wood on the campfire. 

"Come on, let's go," he said. 

"But it's getting dark." 

"If there's anything on the 
island, we'll spot it by the lights. 
Just up on that hill. If we don't 
see anything, we'll come back. 
When morning comes, we can 
look again." 

"Jay," she said, "in lots of 
ways, it's just like a picnic.'' 

"I'm no good at riddles. Tell 
me why it's like a picnic." 

"Why, the fire and eating in 
the open and . . ." 

"Forget it," Vickers stated. 
"We're not on any picnic."

HE moved ahead and she followed close behind him, 
threading their way between the 
thickets and the boulders. Night 
hawks skimmed the air above 
them in graceful, insect-catching 
swoops. From somewhere far off 
came the wickering of a coon. 
A few lightning bugs flashed on 
and off, dancing in the bushes. 

They climbed the hill, not very 
high, but fairly steep, and when 
they reached the top they saw 
the lights, far down toward the 
island's tip, 

"There it is," said Vickers. "I 
figured they would have to be 
here." 

"It's a long way off. Will we 
have to walk it?" 

"Maybe not." 

"But how . . ." 

"And you a telepath." 

She shook her head. "I don't 
understand." 

"Go on and try," said Vickers. 
"Just want to talk to someone 
down there." 

And he remembered Flanders, 
rocking on the porch and saying 
that distance should be no bar 
to telepathy, that a mile or a 
light-year should not make the 
slightest difference. 

"You think I can?" 

"I don't know," said Vickers. 
"You don't want to walk, do 
you?" 

"Not that far." 

"Then give it a try." 



They stood silently, looking 
toward the small area of light in 
the gathering darkness. He tried 
to pick out the different locations. 
There was where Rockefeller 
Center was located back on the 
old Earth, and up there Central 
Park and down there, where the 
East River curved in, the old 
abandoned United Nations structure. But the areas were covered 
with grass and trees instead of 
concrete and asphalt. 

"Jay!" Her whisper was tense 
with excitement. 

"Yes, Ann." 

"I think I have someone." 

"A man or a woman?" 

"Good heavens, neither! He 
says he's a robot! He says he'll 
send someone — no, not someone 
— something for us." * 

"Ann . . ." 

"He says for us to wait right 
here. They'll be right along." 

"Ann, ask him if they can make 
movies." 

"Movies?" 

"Motion pictures. Have they 
got cameras and film?" 

"But what do you . . ." 

"Just go ahead and ask him." 

"He says they can." 

"That's fine," said Vickers. 

"But motion pictures?" 

"I have an idea we can lick 
Crawford yet." 

"Oh, no, you aren't going 
back!" 

"You bet I am."

"Jay Vickers, I won't let you!" 

"You can't stop me," Vickers 
said. "Here, let's sit down and 
wait to be picked up." 

THEY sat down, close together. 
"I have a story," Vickers 
said. "It's about a boy. His name 
was Jay Vickers and he was very 
young ..." He stopped abruptly. 

"Go on," she said. "I'd like to 
hear your story." 
"Some other time." 
"I want to hear it now." 
"Not when a moon is coming 
up," said Vickers. "That's no 
time for stories." 

And he wondered : Can I ever 
tell her that We are closer than 
she thinks, that we came from 
the same life and will go back 
to the same body and that we 
cannot love one another? 

She leaned against him and put 
her head against his shoulder and 
looked up at the sky. 

"It's getting clearer," she said, 
"not so strange now. Queer as it 
may be, it seems right. This other 
world and the things we have, 
those strange abilities and all and 
the strange remembering." 

He put his arm around her and 
she turned her head and gave him 
a quick, impulsive kiss. 

"We'll be happy," she said. 
"The two of us in this new 
world." 

And now, he knew, he could 
never tell her. 



XLVIII 

A GIRL'S voice answered the 
telephone and Vickers asked 
for Crawford. 

"Mr. Crawford is in conference," she said. "He cannot be 
disturbed." 

"Tell him this is Vickers." 

"Mr. Crawford cannot be . . . 
Did you say Vickers? Jay Vickers?" 

"That's right. I have news for 
him." 

"Just a minute, Mr. Vickers." 

He waited, wondering how long 
he might have, for the analyzer 
in the phone booth must have 
sounded the alarm and the exterminator squad must be on the 
way. 

Crawford's voice said, "Hello, 
* Vickers." 

"Call off your dogs," said 
Vickers. "They're wasting your 
time and theirs." 

He heard the rage in Crawford's voice. "I thought I told 
you — " 

"Take it easy. You haven't got 
a chance of potting me. Your 
men couldn't do it when they had 
me cornered.. So if you can't kill 
me, you better dicker with me." 

"Dicker?" 

"That's what I said." 
"Listen, Vickers, I'm not — " 
"Of course you will," said 
Vickers. "That other world business is really rolling now and

you are getting hurt. It's time 
you talked sense." 

''I'm tied up with my directors," Crawford said. 

"That's fine. They're the ones 
I really want to talk to." 

"Vickers, no matter what you're 
.planning, you'll never get away 
with it. You can't leave here 
alive. I can't save you if you 
keep up this foolishness." 

"I'm not going away." 

"I like you, Vickers. I don't 
know why. I certainly have no 
reason to . . ." 

"I'm coming up." 

"All right," said Crawford 
wearily. "Do what you want. It's 
your funeral." 

Vickers picked up the film case 
and stepped out of the booth. An 
elevator car was waiting and he 
walked swiftly toward it, shoulders hunched a little against the 
anticipated bullet in the back. 

"Third floor," he said. 

The elevator operator didn't 
bat an eye. The analyzer by nov? 
must have given its signal, but 
more than likely the operator 
had his instructions on third floor 
passengers. 

"1TICKERS opened the door to 
" North American Research and 

Crawford was waiting for him in 

the reception room. 

"Come on," said Crawford 
He turned and marched ahead 

and Vickers followed him down 



the long hall. He looked at his 
watch and did fast mental arithmetic. It was going better than 
he'd hoped. He still had a margin 
of two or three minutes. It hadn't 
taken as long to convince Crawford as he had thought it might. 

Ann would be calling in ten 
minutes. What happened in that 
time would decide success or failure. 

Crawford stopped in front of 
the door at the end of the hall. 

"You know what you are doing, Vickers?" 

Vickers nodded. 

"One slip and . . ." Crawford 
made a hissing sound between his 
teeth and sliced a finger across 
his throat. 

"I understand," said Vickers. 

"Those men in there are the 
desperate ones. There still is time 
to leave. I won't tell them you 
were here." 

"Cut out the stalling, Crawford." 

"What have you got there?" 

"Some documentary film. It 
will help explain what I have to 
say. You've got a projector inside?" 

Crawford nodded. "But no operator." 

"IH run the machine myself." 
"A deal?" 

"A solution," Vickers said. 
"All right, then. Come in." 
The shades were drawn and 
the room was twilit and the long 



154 




 



table at which the men sat 
seemed to be no more than a row 
of white faces turned toward 
them. 

Vickers followed Crawford 
across the room, feet sinking into 
the heavy carpeting. He looked 
at the men around the table and 
saw that many of them were public figures. 

There, at Crawford's right 
hand, was a banker, and beyond 
him a man who had often been 
called to the White House to be 
entrusted semi -diplomatic missions. And there were others also 
that he recognized, although there 
were many that he didn't, and a 
few of them wore the strange 
dress of other lands.. 

Here was the directorate of 
North American Research, those 
men who guided the destiny of 
the embattled normals against 
the mutant menace — Crawford's 
desperate men. 

"A strange thing has happened, 
gentlemen," said Crawford. "A 
most unsual thing. We have a 
mutant with us." 

IN the silence, the white faces 
flickered around at Vickers, 
then turned back again. 

"Mr. Vickers," Crawford went 
on, "is an acquaintance of some 
standing. You will recall that we 
have talked of him before. At 
one time, we hoped he might be 
able to help us reconcile the dif


ferences between the two branch 
es of the human race. 

"He comes to us of his own 
accord and has indicated to me 
that he may have a possible solution. He has not told me what 
that solution might be. I brought 
him directly here. It's up to you. 
of course, whether you want to 
hear what he has to say." 

"Why, certainly," said one of 
them. "Let the man talk." 

And another said, "Most happy 
to." 

The others nodded their agreement. 

Crawford said to Vickers, "The 
floor is yours." 

Vickers walked to the table's 
head and he was thinking: So 
far, so good. Now if only the rest 
works out. If I don't make a slip. 
If I can carry it off. Because it 
was win or lose; there was no 
middle ground. 

He set the film case on the 
table and said, "No infernal weapon, gentlemen. It's a film that, 
with your permission, I'll show 
you in just a little while." 

They simply sat and looked at 
him and there was nothing that 
you could read in their faces, but 
he felt the coldness of their hatred. 

"You're about to start a war," 
he said. "You're meeting here to 
decide if you should reach out 
and turn oh the tap . . ." 

The white faces seemed to be

leaning forward, all of them 
straining toward him. 

'One of them said: "You're 
either a brave man, Vickers, or 
an absolute idiot." 

"I've come here," said Vickers, "to end the war before it 
starts." 

REACHING into his pocket, 
Vickers' hand came out in a 
nicking motion and tossed the 
thing it held onto the table. 

"That's a top," he said. "A 
thing that kids play with — or 
used to play, at any rate. I want 
to talk to you for a minute about 
a top." 

"A top?" raged someone. "Is 
he trying to make fools of us?" 

But the banker across the table 
said rem ini scent ly, "I had a top 
like that when I was a boy. They 
don't make them any more. I 
haven't seen one of them in 
years." 

He reached out a hand and 
picked up the top and spun it on 
the table. The others craned their 
necks to look at it. 

Vickers glanced at his watch. 
Still on schedule. Now if nothing 
spoiled it! 

"You remember the top, Crawford?" asked Vickers. "The one 
that was in my hotel room that 
night you unexpectedly dropped 
in on me?" 

"I remember it." said Crawford. 



"You spun it and it vanished." 

"And it came back again." 

"Crawford, why did you spin 
that top?" 

Crawford licked his lips in embarrassment. "Why, I don't 
know. It might have been an attempt to rescue a lost memory, 
an urge to be a boy again." 

"You asked me what the top 
was for." 

"You told me it was for going 
into fairyland and I told you that 
a week before I would have said 
that we were, crazy — you for 
saying a thing like that and I 
for listening to you." 

"But before I came in, you 
spun the top. Tell me, Crawford, 
why did you do it?" 

"Go ahead," the banker urged. 
"Tell him." 

"I did," said Crawford. "I just 
told you the reason." 

Behind Vickers, a door opened. 
He turned his head and saw a 
secretary beckoning to Crawford. 

i"VN time, Vickers thought. 

Working like a charm. Ann 
was on the phone and Crawford 
was being called from the room 
to talk to her. And that was the 
way he'd planned it, for with 
Crawford in the room, the plan 
would be hopeless. 

"Mr. Vickers," the banker said, 
"I'm curious about this business 
of the top. What connection is 
there between a top and the prob


156 




 



Icm that we face?" 

"A sort of analogy," replied 
Vickers. "There are certain basic 
differences between the normals 
and the mutants and I can explain them best by the use of a 
top. But before I do, I'd like you 
to see my film. After that I can 
go ahead and tell you and you 
will understand me. If you gentlemen will excuse me?" 

He lifted the film case from the 
table. 

"Why, certainly," the banker 
said. "Go right ahead." 

Vickers went back to the stairs 
which led to the projection booth, 
opened the door and went inside. 

He'd have to work fast and 
surely, for Ann could not hold 
Crawford on the phone very long 
and she had to keep Crawford 
out of the room for at least five 
minutes. 

He slid the film into the folder 
and threaded it through the 
lenses with shaking fingers and 
clipped it on the lower spool and 
then swiftly checked what he had 
done. 

Everything seemed all right. 

He found the switches and 
turned them on and the cone of 
light sprang out to spear above 
the conference table. On the 
screen before the table was a 
brilliantly colored top, spinning, 
with the stripes moving up and 
disappearing, moving up and disappearing — 



The film track said: "Here you 
see a top, a simple toy, but it 
presents one of the most baffling 
illusions . . ." 

The words were right, Vickers 
knew. Robotic experts had spent 
days picking out the right words, 
weaving them together, with just 
th e right rel ationship, j ust the 
right inflection, to give them 
maximum semantic value. The 
words would hold the audience, 
fix their interest on the top, and 
keep it there after the first few 
seconds. 

He came silently down the 
stairs and moved over to the door. 
If Crawford should come back, 
he could hold him off until the 
job was done. 

HPHE film track said: "Now if 
you will watch closely, you 
will see that the lines of color 
seem to move up the body of the 
top and disappear. A child, 
watching the lines of color, might 
wonder where they went, and so 
might anyone . . ." 

He tried to count the seconds 
off and the seconds dragged. 

The film track said: "Watch 
closely now — watch closely. They 
come up and disappear, they 
come up and disappear — " 

There were not nearly so many 
men at the table, only two or 
three now, and they were watching so closely that they had not 
even noticed the others disap

pear. Maybe those two or three 
would stay. Of them all, these 
few might be the only ones who 
weren't unsuspecting mutants. 

Vickers opened the door softly 
and slid out and closed it behind 
him. 

The door shut out the soft 
persuasive voice of the film tract : 
"Come up and disappear- — watch 



Why did you spin that top?" 

Crawford shook his head. "I 
can't understand it, Vickers. It 
doesn't make any sense, but I 
went into fairyland once myself. 
Just like you, when I was a kid. 
I remembered it after I talked 
to you. Maybe because I talked 
to you. I sat on the floor and 
watched the top spin and won



closely — come up and . . ." 

Crawford was coming down 
the hall, lumbering along. 

He saw Vickers and stopped. 

"What do you want?" he 
asked. "What are you out here 
for?" 

"A question," Vickers said, 
"one you didn't answer in there. 



dered where the stripes were going — you know how they come 
up and disappear and then another one comes up and disappears. I wondered where they 
went and I got so interested that 
I must have followed them, because all at once I was in fairyland and there were a lot of

Ann had within her the life of 
that girl who had walked the 
valley with him — the girl he remembered as Kathleen Preston, 
but who had some other name. 
For Ann remembered the valley 
and that she had walked the 
valley in the springtime with 
someone by her side. 

There might be more than Ann. 
There might be three of Ann just 
as there were three of him, but 
that didn't matter, either. Maybe 
Ann's name really was Ann Carter as his really was Jay Vickers. 
Maybe that meant that, when the 
lives drained back into the rightful bodies, it would be his consciousness and Ann's that would 
survive. 

And it was all right now to 
love Ann. She was a separate 
person and not a part of him. 

Ann had come into this world 
to place a telephone call and to 
get Crawford from the room, so 
that he would not recognize the 
danger of the top spinning on 
screen, and now she'd gone back 
to the other world again and the 
threat was gone. 

"Everything's all right," said 
Vickers. "Everything's just fine." 

Soon he'd be going back himself and Ann would be waiting for 
him. And they'd be happy, the 
way she had said they'd be, sitting there on a Manhattan hilltop 
waiting for the robots. 



"Well, then," said Crawford, 
"let's go back in again." 

Vickers "put out his hand to 
stop him. "There's no use going 
in." 

"No use?" 

"Your directors aren't there," 
said Vickers. "They're in the second world. The one, you remember, that the Pretentionists 
preached about in the squares all 
over town." 

CRAWFORD stared at him. 
"The top!" 
"That's right." 

"We'll start again," said Crawford: "Another board, another ..." 

"You haven't got the time. 
This Earth is done. The people 
are fleeing from it. Even those 
who stay won't listen to you, 
won't fight for you." 

"I'll kill you," Crawford said. 
"I'll kill you, Vickers." 

"No, you won't." 

They stood face to face silently, tensely. 

"No," said Crawford. "No, I 
guess I won't. I should, but I 
can't. Why can't I kill you, Vickers?" 

Vickers touched the big man's 
arm. 

"Come on, friend," he said 
softly. "Or should I call you 
brother?"

What Strange Powers 
Did The Ancients Possess? 



PVERY important discovery relating 
*"* to mind power, sound thinking and 
cause and effect, as applied to selfadvancement, was known centuries ago, 
before the masses could read and writeMuch has been written about the wise 
men of old. A popular fallacy has it that 
their secrets of personal power and successful living were lost to the world. 
Knowledge of nature's laws, accumulated through the ages, is never lost. At 
times the great truths possessed by the 
sages were hidden from unscrupulous 
men in high places, but never destroyed. 

Why Were Their Secrets 
Closely Guarded? 

Only recently, as time is measured; not 
more than twenty generations ago, less 
than l/100th of Wo of the earth's 
people were thought capable of receiving basic knowledge about the laws of 
life, for it is an elementary truism that 
knowledge is power and that power 
cannot be entrusted to the ignorant 
and the unworthy. 

Wisdom is not readily attainable by the 
general public; nor recognized when 
right within reach. The average person 
absorbs a multitude of details about 
things, but goes through life without 
ever knowing where and how to acquire 
mastery of the fun damentals of the inner 
mind — that mysterious silent something 
which "whispers" to you from within. 

Fundamental Laws of Nature 

Your habits, accomplishments and weaknesses are the effects of causes. Your 
thoughts and actions' are governed by 
fundamental laws. Example: The law 



of compensation is as fundamental as 
the laws of breathing, eating and sleeping. All fixed laws of nature are as 
fascinating to study as they are vital to 
understand for success in life. 
You can learn to find and follow every 
basic law of life. You can begin at any 
time to discover a whole new world of 
interesting truths. You can start at once 
to awaken your inner powers of selfunderstanding and self-advancement. 
You can learn from one of the world's 
oldest institutions, first known in America in 1694. Enjoying the hign regard 
of hundreds of leaders, thinkers and 
teachers, the order is known as the Rosicrucian Brotherhood. Its complete name 
is the "Ancient and Mystical Order 
Rosae Crucis," abbreviated by the initials "AMORC." The teachings of the 
Order are not sold, for it is not a commercial organization, nor is it a religious 
sect. It is a non-profit fraternity, a 
brotherhood in the true sense.
