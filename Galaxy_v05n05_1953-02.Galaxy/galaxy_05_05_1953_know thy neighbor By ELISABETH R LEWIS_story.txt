know thy neighbor By ELISABETH R. LEWIS 

IT BEGAN with the dead cat 
on the fire escape and ended 
with the green monster in 
the incinerator chute, but still, it 
wouldn't be quite fair to blame 
it all on the neighborhood . . . 

The apartment house was in 
the heart of the district that is 
known as "The Tenderloin" — 
that section of San Francisco 
from Ellis to Market and east 
from Leavenworth to Mason 
Street. Not the best section. 

To Ellen's mind, it was an unsavory neighborhood, but with 
apartments so hard to get and 
this one only $38.00 a month and 
in a regular apartment building 
with an elevator and all — well, 
as she often told the girls at the 
office, you can't be too particular 
these days. 

Nevertheless, it was an ordeal 
to walk up the two blocks from 

Market Street, particularly at 
night when the noise of juke boxes 
dinned from the garish bars, when 
the sidewalks spilled over with 
soldiers and sailors, with peroxided, blowsy- looking women and 
the furtive gamblers who haunted 
the back rooms of the innocentappearing cigar stores that lined 
the street. She walked very fast 
then, never looking to left or 
right, and her heart would pound 



when a passing male whistled. 

But once inside the apartment 
house lobby, she relaxed. In spite 
of its location, the place seemed 
very respectable. She seldom met 
anyone in the lobby or the elevator and, except on rare occasions like last night, the halls 
were as silent as those in the 
swanky apartment houses on Nob 
Hill. 

She knew by sight only two

of her neighbors — the short, 
stocky young man who lived in 
410, and Mrs. Moffatt, in 404. 
Mrs. Moffatt was the essence of 
lavender and old lace, and the 
young man — he was all right, 
really; you couldn't honestly say 
he was shady-looking. 

r\N THIS partfcular morning, 
the man from 410 was waiting for the elevator when Ellen 
came out to get her paper. He 
glanced up at the sound of the 
door and stared. Quickly, she 
shut the door again. She didn't 
like the way he looked at her. 
She was wearing a housecoat over 
her nightgown, and a scarf wrapped around her head to cover 
the bobbypins — a costume as unrevealing as a nun's — but she felt 
as though he had invaded her 
privacy with his stare, like surprising her in the bathtub. 

She waited until she heard the 
elevator start down before opening her door again. The boy must 
have aimed from the stairs; her 
paper was several yards down 
the hall, almost in front of 404. 
She went down to get it. 

Mrs. Moffatt must have heard 
Ellen's footsteps in the hall. An 
old lady with a small income 
(from her late husband, as she 
had explained to Ellen) and little 
to do, she was intensely interested in her neighbors. She opened 
the door of her apartment and 



peered out. Her thin white hair 
was done up in tight kid curlers. 
With her round faded-blue eyes 
and round wrinkled -apple cheeks, 
she looked like an inquisitive 
aged baby. 

"Good morning," said Ellen 
pleasantly. 

"Good morning, my dear," the 
old lady answered. "You're up 
early for a Saturday." 

"Well, I thought I might as 
welt get up and start my housecleaning. I didn't sleep a wink 
after four o'clock this morning 
anyway. Did you hear all that 
racket in the hall?" 

"Why, no, I didn't." The old 
lady sounded disappointed. "I 
don't see how I missed it. I guess 
because I went to bed so late. 
My nephews — you've seen them, 
haven't you? — They're such nice 
boys. They took me to a movie 
last night." 

"Well, I'm surprised you didn't 
hear it," said Ellen. "Thumping 
and scratching, like somebody 
was dragging a rake along the 
floor. I just couldn't get back to 
sleep." 

The old lady clicked her 
tongue. "I'll bet somebody came 
home drunk. Isn't that terrible? 
I wonder who it was." 

"I don't know," said Ellen, "but 
it was certainly a disgrace. I was 
going to call Mrs. Anderson." 

With the door open, the hall 
seemed filled with the very odd 



102 




 



odor of Mrs. Moffatt's apartment 
— not really unpleasant, but 
musty, with the smell of antiques. 
The apartment itself was like a 
museum. Ellen had been inside 
once when the old lady invited 
her in for a cup of tea. Its two 
rooms were crammed with a bizarre assortment of furniture, 
bric-a-brac and souvenirs. 

"Oh, how's your bird this morning?" Ellen asked. 

In addition to being a collector, 
Mrs. Moffatt was an animal fancier. She owned three cats, a 
pair of love-birds, goldfish, and 
even a cage of white mice. One 
of the love-birds, she had informed Ellen yesterday, was ailing. 

"Oh, Buzzy's much better today," she beamed. "The doctor 
told me to feed him whisky every 
three hours — with an eyedropper, 
you know — and you'd be surprised how it helped the little 
fellow. He even ate some birdseed this morning." 

"I'm so glad," said Ellen. She 
picked up her paper and smiled 
at Mrs . Moffatt. "I'll see you 
later." 

The old woman closed her door, 
shutting off the musty smell, and 
Ellen walked back to her own 
apartment. She filled the coffee 
pot with water and four tablespoons of coffee, then dressed 
herself while the coffee percolated. Standing in front of the 



medicine cabinet mirror, she took 
the bobbypins out of her hair. 
Her reflection looked back at her 
from the mirror, and she felt that 
unaccountable depression again. 
I'm not bad-looking, she thought, 
and young, and not too dumb. 
What have other women got that 
I haven't ? She thought of the 
days and years passing, the meals 
all alone, and nothing ever happening. 

That kind of thinking gets you 
nowhere; forget it. She combed 
her hair back, pinned it securely 
behind her ears, ran a lipstick 
over her mouth. Then she went 
into the kitchenette, turned off 
the gas flame under the coffee 
pot, and raised the window shade 
to let in the sun that was just 
beginning to show through morning fog. 

A dead cat lay on the fire escape under the window. 

SHE stared at it, feeling sick 
to her stomach. It was an 
ordinary gray cat, the kind you 
see in every alley, but its head 
was twisted back so that its open 
eyes and open mouth leered at 
her. 

She pulled the blind down, fast. 

Sit down, light a cigarette. It's 
nothing, just a dead cat, that's 
all. But how did it get on the 
fire escape? Fell, maybe, from 
the roof? And how did it get on 
the roof? Besides, I thought cats 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



103 



never got hurt falling. Isn't there 
something about landing on your 
feet like a cat? Maybe that's just 
a legend, like the nonsense about 
nine lives. 

Well . what do I do. she 
thought. I can't sit here and drink 
coffee with that under the window. And God knows I can't 
take it away myself. She shuddered at the thought. Call the manager. 

She got up and went to the 
telephone in the foyer. She found 
the number scribbled on the back 
of the phone book. Her hand was 
shaking when she dialed. 

"This is Ellen Tighe in 402. 
Mrs. Anderson, there's a dead 
cat on the fire escape outside my 
window. You'll have to do something about it." 

Mrs. Anderson sounded halfasleep. "What do you mean, a 
dead cat? Are you sure it's dead? 
Maybe it's sleeping." 

"Of course I'm sure it's dead! 
Can't you send Pete up to take 
it away? It's a horrible thing to 
have under my window." 

"All right, I'll tell Pete to go 
up. He's washing down the lobby 
now. As soon as he's finished, 
I'll send him up." 

Ellen set the phone back on 
its stand. She felt a little silly. 
What a fuss to make over a dead 
cat. But really, outside one's 
window — and before breakfast — 
who could blame me? 



She went back into the kitchenette, carefully not looking toward 
the window, even though the 
shade was drawn, and poured 
herself a cup of coffee. Then she 
sat at the table in the little nook, 
drinking coffee, smoking a cigarette and leafing through the paper. 

The front page was all about 
a flying saucer scare in Marin 
County. She read the headline, 
then thumbed on through the paper, stopping to read the movie 
reviews and the comic page. 

A T THE back section, she was 
attracted by a headline that 
read: "Liquor Strong These Days 
— Customer Turns Green, Says 
Bartender." It was a brief item, 
consciously cute. "John Martin, 
38, a bartender of 1 52 Mason 
Street, was arrested early this 
morning, charged with drunkenness and disturbing the peace, 
after firing several shots from a 
.38 revolver on the sidewalk in 
front of his address. No one was 
injured. Martin's defense, according to police records, was 
that he was attempting to apprehend a *pale-green, claw-handed' 
customer who fled after eating 
a live mouse and threatening 
Martin. 

"Upon questioning, Martin admitted that the unidentified customer had been in the bar for 
several hours and appeared per


104 




 



fectly normal. But he insisted, 
'When I refused to serve him 
after he ate the mouse, he turned 
green and threatened to claw me 
to death,' Martin has a permit to 
carry the gun and was dismissed 
with a fifty dollar fine and a 
warning by Judge Greely against 
sampling his own stock too 
freely." 

Drunken fool, thought Ellen. 
With fresh indignation, she remembered the disturbance in her 
own hall this morning. Nothing 
but drunks and gangsters in this 
neighborhood. She thought 
vaguely of looking at the "For 
Rent" section of the want ads. 

There was a noise on the fire 
escape. Ellen reached over and 
lifted up the shade. The janitor 
was standing there with a big 
paper sack in his hand. 

Ellen opened the window and 
asked, "How do you think it got 
there, Pete?" 

"I dunno. Maybe fall offa the 
roof. Musta been in a fight." 

"What makes you think so?" 

' 'Neck's all torn. Big teeth 
marks. Maybe dog get him." 

"Up here?" 

"Somebody find, maybe throw 
hfre — I dunno." Pete scratched 
his head. "You don't worry any 
more, though. I take away now. 
No smell, even." 

He grinned at her and scuttled 
to the other end of the fire escape 
where he climbed through the 



window to the fourth floor corridor. 

Ellen poured herself a second 
cup of coffee and lighted another 
cigarette, then turned to the woman's page in the paper. She 
read the Advice Column and the 
Psychology and glanced through 
the "Help Wanted — Women" in 
the classifieds. That finished the 
morning's reading. She looked at 
her watch. Almost ten. 

She carried her coffee cup to 
the sink, rinsed it out and set it 
on the drainboard. There was 
still a cup or more coffee left in 
the pot. That could be warmed 
over later, but she took out the 
filler and dumped the grounds 
into the paper bag that held 
garbage. The bag was almost 
full. 

I'll throw it in the incinerator 
now, she thought, before I 
straighten the apartment. 

She emptied the ashtrays — the 
one beside her bed and the other 
on the breakfast table — then 
started down the hall with the 
garbage bag in her hand. 

^T^HE incinerator chute was at 
the rear of the hall, next to 
the service stairs. Ellen could see--, 
the door standing slightly open. 
She hesitated. 410 might be there. 
It was bad enough to ride in the 
elevator with him, feeling his 
eyes on her, but there was something unbearably intimate about 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



105 



standing beside him, emptying 
garbage. 

The door seemed to move a 
little, but nobody came out. She 
waited another minute. Oh, well, 
maybe the last person out there 
just forgot to shut the door tight. 
She opened it wider, stepped out 
on the stair landing. No one was 
there. 

The chute was wide, almost 
three feet around. Ellen opened 
the top and started to throw the 
bag down. Something was stuck 
in there. Her eyes saw it, but her 
brain refused to believe. 

What was there, blocking the 
chute, looked like — looked like — 
a chicken's foot, gnarled, clawed, 
but as large as a human foot — 
and an ugly, sickly green! 

Automatically, she reached in 
and clutched it. Her stomach 
turned at the cold feel of the 
thing, but still she tugged at it, 
trying to work it loose. It was 
heavy. She pulled with all her 
strength, felt it start to slide back 
up the chute. Then it was free! 

She gaped in sick horror at the 
thing she held. Her hand opened 
weakly and she sat down on the 
floor, her head swimming and her 
throat muscles retching. Dimly, 
she heard the thing rattle and 
bump down to the incinerator 
in the basement. 

The full horror of it gradually 
hit home. Ellen stood up, swaying, and ran blindly down the 



hall. Her feet thudded on the 
carpeted floor. As she passed 404, 
she was vaguely conscious of Mrs. 
Moffatt's concerned face poking 
around the door. 

"Is there something wrong. 
Miss Tighe?" 

"No," Ellen managed to gasp 
"It's all right — really — all right." 

She kept on running, burst 
through the apartment door, 
slammed it behind her, fell on 
her knees in the bathroom and 
became thoroughly, violently ill. 

She continued to kneel, unable 
to think, her head against the cool 
porcelain bowl. Finally, she stood 
up weakly, ran cold water, washed her face and streaming eyes. 
Thank God the wall bed was still 
down! She fell on it, shaking. 

YV/HAT was that unbelievable 
ghastly, impossible thing? 
It was the size of a man, but thin, 
skeleton thin, and the color of 
brackish water. It had two legs, 
two arms, like a man . . . but ending with those huge, birdlike 
claws. Heaven alone knew what 
its face was like. She had let go 
before it was that far clear of the 
chute. 

She thought of the story in the 
paper. So that was what the bartender saw! He wasn't xlrunk at 
all, and what happened when he 
told the police? They laughed at 
him. They'd laugh at me, too, 
she thought. The proof is gone.

burned up in the incinerator. Why 
did this happen to me? Dead cats 
on the fire escape, dead monsters 
in the incinerator chute . . . it's 
this terrible neighborhood! 

She tried to think coherently. 
Maybe the cat had something to 
do with it. The bartender said the 
thing ate a mouse — maybe it had 
tried to eat the cat, too. A monster like that might eat anything. 
Her stomach started churning 
again at the thought. 

But what was it doing in the 
incinerator chute? Someone in 
the building must have put it 
there, thinking it would slide all 
the way down and be burned up. 
Who? One of them, probably. 
But there couldn't be any more 
green monsters around. They 
can't live in an apartment house, 
walk the streets like anyone else, 
not even in this neighborhood. 

She remembered something else 
in the bartender's story. He said 
it looked perfectly normal at first. 
That meant they could look like 
humans if they wanted to. Hypnotism? Then any man could 
be . . . 

Suddenly another thought 
struck her. Supposing they find 
out I saw — what will they do to 
me? 

She jumped up from the bed, 
white with fear, her faintness forgotten in the urge to escape. She 
snatched her bag from the dresser, threw on her brown coat. 



At the door, she hesitated, 
afraid to venture into the hall, 
yet afraid to stay inside. Finally, 
she eased open the door, peered 
out into the corridor. It was deserted. She ran to the elevator, 
punched the bell, heard the car 
begin its creaky, protesting ascent. 

The elevator door had an automatic spring closing. The first 
time she tried it, her hands shook 
and the door sprang closed before she got in. She tried it again. 
This time she managed to hold it 
open long enough to get inside. 
She pushed the button, felt the 
elevator shake and grind and 
move slowly down. 

Out into the lobby. 

Out into the street. 

HPHE FOG was completely gone 
now. The sun shone on the 
still-damp street. There were 
very few people around — The 
Tenderloin sleeps late. She went 
into the restaurant next door, 
sat down at the white-tiled counter. She was the only customer. 
A sleepy-eyed waitress, her black 
hair untidily caught into a net, 
waited, pad in hand. 

"Just coffee," Ellen mumbled. 

She drank it black and it scalded her throat going down. The 
waitress put a nickel in the juke 
box and then Bing Crosby was 
singing "Easter Parade." Everything was so normal. Listening to 



KNOW THY NEIGHBOR 



107 



Bing Crosby, how could you 
believe in things like green 
monsters? In this sane, prosaic 
atmosphere, Ellen thought, I 
must be batty. 

She said to herself, "I'm Ellen 
Tighe, bookkeeper, and I just saw 
the body of a green man with 
claws on his feet . . ." No, that 
didn't help a bit. Put it this way: 
"I'm Ellen Tighe and I'm 27 
years old and I'm not married. 
Let's face it, any psychiatrist will 
tel! you that's enough cause for 
neurosis. So I'm having delusions." 

It made more sense that way. 
I read that story in the paper, 
Ellen thought, and it must have 
registered way down in my subconscious. That had to be it. Any 
other way, it was too horrible, 
too impossible to be borne. 

I'll go back to the apartment 
and call Dr. Clive, thought Ellen. 
She had the feeling, no doubt 
held over from the days of 
measles and mumps, that a doctor could cure anything, even 
green monsters on the brain. 

She drank the last of the coffee 
and fished in her coin purse for 
change. Picking up the check, 
she walked over to the cash register at the end of the counter, 
facing the street. The untidy 
waitress came from the back of 
the restaurant to take the money. 

Ellen looked out at the street 
through the glass front. The man 



from 410 was standing out there, 
smoking a cigarette, watching 
her. When their eyes met, he 
abruptly threw away the cigarette and started walking toward 
the apartment house. Again she 
felt that faint dread she had experienced in the hall earlier. 

The waitress picked up her 
quarter, gave her back a nickel 
and a dime. Ellen put the change 
into her purse, got out her key 
chain and held it in her hand 
while she walked quickly next 
door. 410 was just ahead of her 
in the lobby; he held the front 
door open for her. 

She kept her head down, not 
looking at his face, and they 
walked, Indian file, across the 
lobby to the elevator. He opened 
the elevator doors, too, and she 
stepped in ahead of him. 

WHEN the doors clanged shut, 
she had a feeling of panic. 
Alone with him . . . cut off from 
help. He didn't pretend not to 
know her floor, but silently pressed the proper button. While the 
car moved slowly upward, her 
heart was beating wildly. 

I'm not convinced, she thought, 
I'm not convinced. I saw it so 
plainly ... I felt it, cold in my 
hands. 

The elevator stopped. The man 
held the door open and for a 
moment she thought he was going to say something. His free 




 



hand made a swift, involuntary 
movement as though he were 
going to catch her arm. She 
shrank away, but he stepped back 
and let her through. 

Ellen almost ran down the hall. 
Behind her, she heard his footsteps going in the opposite direction toward his apartment. She 
was panting when she reached 
her door. She fumbled for the 
right key — front door, office — 
and then she froze. There was a 
scratching sound in the apartment. 

She put her ear close to the 
door, listened. There was a rasping noise, like somebody dragging a rake ... or like claws, 
great heavy claws, moving over 
the hardwood floors! 

Ellen backed away from the 
door. It was true, then. She retreated, inch by inch, silently. 
Get away, leave before it catches 
you! She turned, ready to make 
a dash for the elevator . . . and 
faced the man from 410. 

Down at the end of the hall, 
in front of his apartment, he was 
watching her. The way he lingered outside the restaurant, the 
way he looked at her. One of 
them . . . maybe underneath that 
homely, ordinary face, his skin 
was green and clammy. Maybe 
there were long, sharp claws on 
his feet. 

She was breathing unevenly 



now. Trapped! The thing in the 
apartment, the man in the hall. 
Her eyes darted to the elevator, 
then back, down the hall, past 
the door marked 404 . . . the door 
marked 404! She covered the few 
yards in a mad dash, flung herself at the door, pounding wildly. 

"Please, please!" she sobbed. 
"Mrs. Moffatt, open, please!" 

The door opened at once. Mrs. 
Moffatt's round, wrinkled face 
beamed at her. 

"Come in, my dear, come in." 

She almost fell over the landing. The door closed behind her. 

She stumbled to the davenport, 
sank down, gasping. Two cats 
rubbed against her legs, purring. 
Two cats? 

She heard herself say stupidly, 
"Mrs. Moffatt, where's the other 
cat?" and wondered why she said 
it. 

Then she understood. 

The old lady's face quivered, 
altered, melted into something 
. . . something green. 

|~WUTSIDE in the hall, the man 
^-^ from 410 slowly returned to 
his apartment. Pushing open the 
door, he thought, I'll never get 
the nerve to ask her out. 

Well, probably wasn't a chance, 
anyhow. What would a girl like 
her have to do with a lousy cop 
like me?
