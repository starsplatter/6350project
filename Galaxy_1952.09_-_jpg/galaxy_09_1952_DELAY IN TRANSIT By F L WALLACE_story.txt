DELAY IN TRANSIT By F. L. WALLACE 


"MUSCLES tense," said 

9 Dimanche. "Neural 

XV JL index 1.76, unusually 
high. Adrenalin squirting through 
his system. In effect, he's stalking 
you. Intent ; probably assault 
with a deadly weapon." 

"Not interested," said Cassal 
firmly, his subvocalization inaudible to anyone but Dimanche. 
"I'm not the victim type. He was 
standing on the walkway near 
the brink of the thoroughfare. 
I'm going back to the habitat 
hotel and sit tight." 



"First you have to get there," 
Dimanche pointed out. "I mean, 
is it safe for a stranger to walk 
through the city?" 

"Now that you mention it, no," 
answered Cassal. He looked^ 
around apprehensively. "Where 
is he?" 

"Behind you. At the moment 
he's pretending interest in a merchandise display." 

A native stamped by, eyes 
brown and incurious. Apparently 
he was accustomed to the sight 
of an Earthman standing alone,

S 



Adam's apple bobbing up and 
down silently. It was a Godolphian axiom that all travelers 
were crazy. 

Cassal looked up. Not an air 
taxi in sight; Godolph shut down 
at dusk. It would be pure luck if 
he found a taxi before morning. 
Of course he could walk back to 
the hotel, but was that such a 
good idea? 

A Godolphian city was peculiar. 
And, though not intended, it was 
peculiarly suited to certain kinds 
of violence. A human pedestrian 
was at a definite disadvantage. 

"Correction," said Dimanche. 
"Not simple assault. He has 
murder in mind." 

"It still doesn't appeal to me," 
said Cassal. Striving to look unconcerned, he strolled toward the 
building side of the walkway and 
Stared into the interior of a small 
cafe. Warm, bright and dry. Inside, he might find safety for a 
time. 

Damn the man who was following him! It would be easy 
enough to elude him in a normal 
city. On Godolph, nothing was 
^normal. In an hour the streets 
would be brightly lighted — for 
native eyes. A human would consider it dim. 

"Why did he choose me?" 
asked Cassal plaintively. "There 
must be something he hopes to 
gain." 

"I'm working on it," said Di


manche. "But remember. I have 
limitations. At short distances I 
can scan nervous systems, collect and interpret physiological 
data. I can't read minds. The 
best I can do is report what a 
person says or subvocalizes. If 
you're really interested in finding 
out why he wants to kill you, I 
suggest you turn- the problem 
over to the godawful police." 

"Godolph, not godawful," corrected Cassal absently. 

That was advice he couldn't 
follow, good as it seemed. He 
could give the police no evidence 
save through Dimanche. There 
were various reasons, many of 
them involving the law. for leaving the device called Dimanche 
out of it. The police would act if 
they found a body. His own, say, 
floating face-down on some quiet 
street. That didn't seem the 
proper approach, either. 

"Weapons?" 

"The first thing I searched him 
for. Nothing very dangerous. A 
long knife, a hard striking object. 
Both concealed on his person." 

Cassal strangled slightly. Di manche needed a good stiff 
course in semantics. A knife was 
still the most silent of weapons. 
A man could die from it. His 
hand strayed toward his pocket. 
He had a measure of protection 
himself. 

"Report," said Dimanche. "Not 
necessarily final. Based, perhaps. 



& 




 



on tenuous evidence." 

"Let's have it anyway." 

"His motivation is connected 
somehow with your being marooned here. For some reason you 
can't get off this planet." 

That was startling information, 
though not strictly true. A thousand star systems were waiting 
for him, and a ship to take him to 
each one. 

Of course, the one ship he 
wanted hadn't come in. Godolph 
was a transfer point for stars 
nearer the center of the Galaxy. 
When he had left Earth, he had 
known he would have to wait a 
few days here. He hadn't expected a delay of nearly three weeks. 
Still, it wasn't unusual. Interstellar schedules over great distances 
were not as reliable as they might 
be. 

Was this man, whoever and 
whatever he might be, connected 
with that delay? According to 
Dimanche, the man thought he 
was. He was self-deluded or did 
he have access to information 
that Cassal didn't? 

TAENTON Cassal, sales engineer, paused for a mental 
survey of himself. He was a good 
engineer and, because he was exceptionally well matched to his 
instrument, the best salesman 
that Neuronics, Inc., had. On the 
basis of these qualifications, he 
had been selected to make a long 



journey, the first part of which 
already lay behind him. He had 
to go to Tunney 2 1 to see a man. 
That man wasn't important to 
anyone save the company that 
employed him, and possibly not 
even to them. 

The thug trailing him wouldn't 
be interested in Cassal himself, 
his mission, which was a commercial one, nor the man on Tunney. 
And money wasn't the objective, 
if Dimanche' s analysis was 
right. What did the thug want? 

Secrets? Cassal had none, except, in a sense, Dimanche. And 
that was too well kept on Earth, 
where the instrument was invented and made, for anyone this 
far away to have learned about 
it. 

And yet the thug wanted to 
kill him. Wanted to? Regarded 
him as good as dead. It might 
pay him to investigate the matter 
further, if it didn't involve too 
much risk. 

"Better start moving." That 
was Dimanche. "He's getting suspicious." 

Cassal went slowly along the 
narrow walkway that bordered 
each side of that boulevard, the 
transport tide. It was raining 
again. It usually was on Godolph, 
which was a weather- control led 
planet where the natives , like 
rain. 

He adjusted the controls of the 
weak force field that repelled the 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



7 



rain. He widened the angle of the 
field until water slanted through 
it unhindered. He narrowed it 
around him until it approached 
visibility and the drops bounced 
away. He swore at the miserable 
climate and the near amphibians 
who created it. 

A few hundred feet away, a 
Godolphian girl waded out of the 
transport tide and climbed to the 
walkway. It was this sort of thing 
that made life dangerous for a 
human— Venice revised, brought 
up to date in a fastcr-than-light 
age. 

Water. It was a perfect engineering material. Simple, cheap, 
infinitely flexible. With a minimum of mechanism and at breakneck speed, the ribbon of the 
transport tide flowed at different 
levels throughout the city. The 
Godolphian merely plunged in 
and was carried swiftly and 
noiselessly to his destination. 
Whereas a human — Cassal shivered. If he were found drowned, 
it would be considered an accident. No investigation would be 
made. The thug who was trailing 
him had certainly picked the 
right place. 

The Godolphian girl passed. 
She wore a sleek brown fur. her 
own. Cassal was almost positive 
she muttered a polite "Arf?" as 
she sloshed by. What she meant 
by that, he didn't know and 
didn't intend to find out. 



"Follow her." instructed Di manche. "We've got to investigate our man at closer range." 

OBEDIENTLY. Cassal turned 
and began walking after the 
girl. Attractive in an anthropomorphic, seal-like way, even 
from behind. Not graceful out of 
her element, though. 

The would-be assassin was still 
looking at merchandise as Cassal 
retraced his steps. A man, or at 
least man type. A big fellow, 
physically quite capable of violence, if size had anything to do 
with it. The face, though, was 
out of character. Mild, almost 
meek. A scientist or scholar. It 
didn't fit with murder. 

"Nothing," said Dimanche disgustedly. "His mind froze when 
we got close. I could feel his 
shouldcrblades twitching as we 
passed. Anticipated guilt, of 
course. Projecting to you the 
action he plans. That makes the 
knife definite." 

Well beyond the window at 
which the thug watched and 
•waited, Cassal stopped. Shakily 
he produced a cigarette and fumbled for a lighter. 

"Excellent thinking," com* 
mended Dimanche. "He won't attempt anything on this street. 
Too dangerous. Turn aside at the 
next deserted intersection and let 
him folloi/ the glow of your cigarette." 




 



The lighter flared in his hand. 
"That's one way of finding out," 
said Cassal. "But wouldn't I be a 
lot safer if I just concentrated 
on getting back to the hotel?'* 

'Tm curious. Turn here." 

"Go to hell," said Cassal nervously. Nevertheless, when he 
came to that intersection, he 
turned there. 

It was a Godolphian equivalent of an alley, narrow and dark, 
oily slow-moving water gurgling 
at one side, high cavernous walls 
looming on the other. 

He would have to adjust the 
curiosity factor of Dimanche. It 
was all very well to be interested 
in the man who trailed him, but 
there was also the problem of 
coming out of this adventure 
alive. Dimanche, an electronic 
instrument, naturally wouldn't 
consider that. 

"Easy," warned Dimanche. 
"He's at the entrance to the alley, 
walking fast. He's surprised and 
pleased that you took this route." 

"I'm surprised, too," remarked 
Cassal. "But I wouldn't say I'm 
pleased. Not just now." 

"Careful. Even subvocalized 
conversation is distracting." The 
mechanism concealed within his 
body was silent for an instant and 
then continued: "His blood pressure is rising, breathing is faster. 
At a time like this, he may be 
ready to verbalize why he wants 
to murder you. This is critical." 



"That's no lie," agreed Cassal 
bitterly. The lighter was in his 
hand. He clutched it grimly. It 
was difficult not to look back. 
The darkness assumed an even 
more sinister quality. 

"Quiet," said Dimanche. "He's 
verbalizing about you." 

"He's decided I'm a nice fellow 
after all. He's going to stop and 
ask me for a light." 

"I don't think so," answered 
Dimanche, "He's whispering: 
'Poor devil. 1 hate to do it. But 
it's really his life or mine'." 

"He's more right than he 
knows. Why all this violence, 
though? Isn't there any clue?" 

"None at all," admitted Dimanche. "He's very close. You'd 
better turn around." 

CASSAL turned, pressed the 
stud on the lighter. It should 
have made him feel more secure, 
but it didn't. He could see very 
little. 

A dim shadow rushed at him. 
He jumped away from the water 
side of the alley, barely in time. 
He could feel the rush of air as 
the assailant shot by. 

"Hey!" shouted Cassal. 

Echoes answered; nothing else 
did. He had the uncomfortable 
feeling that no one was going to 
come to his assistance. 

"He wasn't expecting that reaction," explained Dimanche. 
"Thaf s why he missed. He's

♦ 



turned around and is coming 
back." 

"I'm armed!" shouted Cassal. 

"That won't stop him. He 
doesn't believe you." 

Cassal grasped the lighter. 
That is, it had been a lighter a 
few seconds before. Now a needlethin blade had snapped out and 
projected stiffly. Originally it had 
been designed as an emergency 
surgical instrument. A little 
imagination and a few changes 
had altered its function, converting it into a compact, efficient 
stiletto. 

"Twenty feet away." .advised 
Dimanche. "He knows you can't 
see him, but he can see your 
silhouette by the light from the 
main thoroughfare. What he 
doesn't know is that I can detect 
every move he makes and keep 
you posted below the level of his 
hearing." 

"Stay on him." growled Cassal 
nervously. He flattened himself 
against the wall. 

"To the right." whispered Dimanche. "Lunge forward. About 
five feet. Low." 

Sickly, he did so. He didn't 
care to consider the possible effects of a miscalculation. In the 
darkness. l*ow far was five feet? 
Fortynately, his estimate was 
( Direct. The rapier encountered 
yielding resistance, the soggy 
kind: flesh. The tough blade bent, 
but did not break. His opponent 



gasped and broke away. 

"Attack !" howled Dimanche 
against the bone behind his ear. 
"You've got him. He can't imagine how you know where he is 
in the darkness. He's afraid." 

Attack he did, slicing about 
wildly. Some of the thrusts 
landed: some didn't. The percentage was low, the total amount 
high. His opponent fell to the 
ground, gasped and was silent. 

Cassal fumbled in his pockets 
and flipped on a light. The man 
lay near the water side of the 
alley. One leg was crumpled 
under him. He didn't move. 

"Heartbeat slow," said Dimanche solemnly. "Breathing 
barely perceptible." 

"Then he's not dead," said 
Cassal in relief. 

Foam flecked from the still 
lips and ran down the chin. Blood 
oozed from cuts on the face. 

"Respiration none, heartbeat 
absent," stated Dimanche. 

TTORRIFIED. Cassal gazed at 
*1 the body. Self-defense, of 
course, but would the police believe it? Assuming they did. 
they'd still have to investigate. 
The rapier was an illegal concealed weapon. And they would 
question him until they discovered Dimanche. Regrettable, but 
what could he do about it? 

Suppose he were detained long 
enough to miss the ship bound 




 



for Tunney 21? 

Grimly, he laid down the 
rapier. He might as well get to 
the bottom of this. Why had the 
man attacked? What did he 
want? 

"I don't know," replied Dimanche irritably. "I can interpret body data — a live body. I 
can't work on a piece of meat." 

Cassal searched the body thoroughly. Miscellaneous personal 
articles of no value in identifying 
the man. A clip with a startling 
amount of money in it. A small 
white card with something scribbled on it. A picture of a woman 
and a small child posed against a 
background which resembled no 
world Cassal had ever seen. That 
was all. 

Cassal stood up in bewilderment. Dimanche to the contrary, 
there seemed to be no connection 
between this dead man and his 
own problem of getting to Tunney 21. 

Right now, though, he had to 
dispose of the 'body. He glanced 
toward the boulevard. So far no 
one had been attracted by the 
violence. 

He bent down to .retrieve the 
lighter-rapier. Dimanche shouted 
at him. Before he could react, 
someone landed on him. He fell 
forward, vainly trying to grasp 
the weapon. Strong fingers felt 
for his throat as he was forced 
to the ground. 



He threw the attacker off and 
staggered to his feet. He heard 
footsteps rushing away. A slight 
splash followed. Whoever it was, 
he was escaping by way of water. 

Whoever it was. The man he 
had thought he had slain was no 
longer in sight. 

"Interpret body data, do you?'* 
muttered Cassal. "Liveliest dead 
man I've ever been strangled by." 

"It's just possible there are 
some breeds of men who can control the basic functions of their 
body," said Dimanche defensively. "When I checked him, he had 
no/ heartbeat." 

"Remind me not to accept your 
next evaluation so completely," 
grunted Cassal. Nevertheless, he 
was relieved, in a fashion. He 
hadn't wanted to kill the man. 
And now there was nothing he'd 
have to explain to the police. 

He needed the cigarette he 
stuck between his lips. For the 
second time he attempted to pick 
up the rapier- lighter. This time 
he was successful. Smoke swirled 
into his lungs and quieted his 
nerves. He squeezed the weapon 
into the shape of a lighter and 
put it away. 

Something, however, was missing — his wallet. 

The thug had relieved him of 
it in the second round of the 
scuffle. Persistent fellow. Damned 
persistent. 

It really didn't matter. He 



DILAY IN TRANSIT 



Ml 



fingered the clip he had taken 
from the supposedly dead body. 
He had intended to turn it over 
to the police. Now he might as 
well keep it to reimburse him for 
his loss. It contained more money 
than his wallet had. 

Except for the identification 
tab he always carried in his wallet, it was more than a fair exchange. The identification, a 
rectangular piece of plastic, was 
useful in establishing credit, but 
with the money he now had, he 
wouldn't need credit. If he did, 
he could always send for another 
tab. 

A white card fluttered from the 
clip. He caught it as it fell. Curiously he examined it. Blank except for one crudely printed word, 
stab. His unknown assailant certainly* had tried. 

Tf\HE old man stared at the 
door, an obsolete visual projector wobbling precariously on 
his head. He closed his eyes and 
the lettering on the door disappeared. Cassal was too far away 
to see what it had been. The 
technician opened his eyes and 
concentrated. Slowly a new sign 
formed on the door. 

TRAVELERS AH> BIRF-Al! 
Murra Foray. First Counselor 

It was a drab sign, but, then, 
it was a dismal, backward 



planet. The old technician passed 
on to the next door and closed 
his eyes again. 

With a sinking feeling. Cassal 
walked toward the entrance. He 
needed help and he had to find it 
in this dingy rathole. 

Inside, though, it wasn't dingy 
and it wasn't a rathole. More like 
a maze, an approved scientific 
one. Efficient, though not comfortable. Travelers Aid was 
busier than he thought it would 
be. Eventually he managed to 
squeeze into one of the many 
small counseling rooms. 

A woman appeared on the 
screen, crisp and cool. "Please 
answer everything the machine 
asks. When the tape is complete, 
I'll be available for consultation." 

Cassal wasn't sure he was going to like her. "Is this necessary?" he asked. "It's merely a 
matter of information." 

"We have certain regulations 
we abide by." The woman smiled 
frostily. "I can't give you any 
information until you comply 
with them." 

"Sometimes regulations are 
silly," said Cassal firmly. "Let me 
speak to the first counselor." 

"You are speaking to her," she 
said. Her fa'ce disappeared from 
the screen. 

Cassal sighed. So far he hadn't 
made a good impression. 

Travelers Aid Bureau, in addition to regulations, was ahun

dantl y suppl i e d with official 
curiosity. When the machine finished with him, Cassal had the 
feeling he could be recreated from 
the record it had of him. His individuality had been capsuled into 
a series of questions and answers. 
One thing he drew the line at— 
why he wanted to go to Tunney 
21 was his own business. 

The first counselor reappeared. 
Age, indeterminate. Not, he supposed, that anyone would be curious about it. Slightly taller than 
average, rather on the slender 
side. Face was broad at the brow, 
narrow at the chin and "her eyes 
were enigmatic. A dangerous woman. 

CJHE glanced down at the data. 
^ "Denton Cassal, native of 
Earth. Destination, Tunney 21." 
She looked up at him. "Occupation, sales engineer. Isn't that an 
odd combination?" Her smile was 
quite superior. 

"Not at all. Scientific training 
as an engineer. Special knowledge 
of customer relations." 

"Special knowledge of a thousand races? How convenient." 
Her eyebrows arched. 

"I think so," he agreed blandly. "Anything else you'd like to 
know?" 

"Sorry. I didn't mean to offend 

you." , 

He could believe that or not 
as he wished. He didn't. 



"You refused to answer why 
you were going to Tunney 21. 
Perhaps I can guess. They're the 
best scientists in the Galaxy. You 
wish to study under them." 

Close — biit wrong on two 
counts. They were good scientists, 
though not necessarily the best. 
For instance, it was doubtful that 
they could build Dimanche, even 
if they had ever thought of it, 
which was even less likely. 

There was, however, one relatively obscure research worker on 
Tunney 21 that Neuronics wanted 
on their staff. If the fragments of 
his studies that had reached 
Earth across the vast distance 
meant anything, he could help 
Neuronics perfect instantaneous 
radio. The company that could 
build a radio to span the reaches 
of the Galaxy with no time lag 
could set its own price, which 
could be control of all communications, transport, trade — a galactic monopoly. Cassal's share 
would be a cut of all that. 

His part was simple, on the 
surface. He was to persuade that 
researcher to come to Earth, it 
he could. Literally, he had to 
guess the Tunnesian's price before the Tunnesian himself knew 
it. In addition, the reputation of 
Tunnesian scientists being exceeded only by their arrogance, 
Cassal had to convince him that 
he wouldn't be working for ignorant Earth savages. The exist

13 



ence of such an instrument as 
Dimanche was a key factor. 

Her voice broke though his 
thoughts. "Now, then, what's 
your problem?" 

"I Was told on Earth I might 
have to wait a few days on Godolph. I've been here three weeks. 
I want information on the ship 
bound for Tunney 21." 

"Just a moment." She glanced 
at something below the angle of 
the screen. She looked up and her 
eyes were grave. "Rickrock C 
arrived yesterday. Departed for 
Tunney early this morning." 

"Departed?" He got up and 
sat down again, swallowing hard. 
"When will the next ship arrive?** 

"Do you know how many stars 
there are in the Galaxy?" she 
asked. 

He didn't answer. 

"rpHAT'S right," she said. 

"Billions. Tunney, according 
to the notation, is near the center 
of the Galaxy, inside the third 
ring. You've covered about a 
third of the distance to it. Local 
traffic, anything within a thousand light-years, is relatively easy 
to manage. At longer distances, 
you take a chance. You've had 
yours and missed it. Frankly, 
Cassal, I don't know when another ship bound for Tunney 
will show up on or neaF Godolph. Within the next five years 
—maybe.'* 



HE blanched. "How long would 
it take to get there using 
local transportation, star - hopping?" 

"Take my advice: don't try it. 
Five years, if you're lucky." 

"I don't need that kind of 
luck." 

"I suppose not," She hesitated. 
"You're determined to go on?" 
At the emphatic nod, she sighed. 
"If that's your decision, we'll try 
to help you. To start things moving, we'll need a print of your 
identification tab." 

"There's something funny 
about her," Dimanche decided. It 
was the usual speaking voice of 
the instrument, no louder than 
the noise the blood made in coursing through arteries and veins. 
Cassal could hear it plainly, because it was virtually inside his 
ear. 

Cessal ignored his private 
voice. "Identification tab? I don't 
have it with me. In fact, I may 
have lost it." 

She smiled in instant disbelief. 
"We're not trying to pry into any 
part of your past you may wish 
concealed. However, it's much 
easier for us to help you if you 
have your identification. Now if 
you can't remember your real 
name and where you put your 
identification— ,J She arose and 
left the screen. "Just a moment." 

He glared uneasily at 'the spot 
where the first counselor wasn't.

His real name! 

"Relax," Dimanche suggested. 
"She didn't mean it as a personal 
insult." 

Presently she returned. 

"I have news for you, whoever 
you are." 

"Cassal," he said firmly. "Denton Cassal, sales engineer. Earth. 
If you don't believe it, send back 
to — " He stopped. It had taken 
him four months to get to Godolph, non-stop, plus a six-month 
wait on Earth for a ship to show 
up that was bound in the right 
direction. Over distances such as 
these, it just wasn't practical to 
send back to Earth for anything. 

"I see you understand." She 
glanced at the card in her hand. 
"The spaceport records indicate 
that when Rickrock C took off 
this morning, there was a Denton 
Cassal on board, bound for Tunney 21." 

"It wasn't I," he said dazedly. 
He knew who it was, though. The 
man who had tried to kill him 
last night. The reason for the attack now became clear. The thug 
had wanted his identification tab. 
Worse, he had gotten it. 

"No doubt it wasn't," she said 
wearily. "Outsiders don't seem to 
understand what galactic travel 
entails." 

Outsiders? Evidently what she 
called those who lived beyond 
the second transfer ring. Were 
those who lived at the edge of 



the Galaxy, beyond the first ring, 
called Rimmers? Probably. 

SHE was still speaking: "Ten 
years to cross the Galaxy, 
without stopping. At present, no 
ship is capable of that. Real 
scheduling is impossible. Populations shift and have to be supplied. A ship is taken off a run 
for repairs and is never put back 
on. It's more urgently needed 
elsewhere. The man who depended on it is left waiting; years 
pass before he learns it's never 
coming. 

"If we had instantaneous radio, 
that would help. Confusion 
wouldn't vanish overnight, but it 
would diminish. We wouldn't 
have to depend on ships for all 
the news. Reservations could be 
made ahead of time, credit established, lost identification replaced — " 

"I've traveled before," he interrupted stiffly. "I've never had 
any trouble." 

She seemed to be exaggerating 
the difficulties. True, the center 
was more congested. Taking each 
star as the starting point for a 
limited number of ships and using 
statistical probability «as a guide 
— why, no man would arrive at 
his predetermined destination. 

But that wasn't the way it 
worked. Manifestly, you couldn't 
compare galactic transportation 
to the erratic paths of air mole

rs 



cules m a giant room. Or could 

you? 

For the average man, anyone 
who didn't have his own interstellar ship, was the comparison 
too apt? It might be. 

"You've traveled outside, where 
there are still free planets waiting 
to be settled. Where a man is 
welcome, if he's able to work." 
She paused. "The center is different. Populations are excessive. 
Inside the third ring, no man is 
allowed off a ship without an 
identification tab. They don't encourage immigration." 

In effect, that meant no ship 
bound for the center would take 
a passenger without identification. 
No ship owner would run the 
risk of having a permanent guest 
on board, someone who couldn't 
be yd of when his money was 
gone. 

Cassal held his head in his 
hands. Tunney 21 was inside the 
third ring. 

"Next time/' she said, "don't 
let anyone take your identification." 

"I won't," he promised grimly. 

THE woman looked directly at 
him. H*er eyes were bright. 
He revised his estimate of her 
age drastically downward. She 
couldn't be as old as he. Nothing 
outward had happened, but she 
no longer seemed dowdy. Not 
that he was interested. Still, it 



might pay him to be friendly to 
the first counselor. 

"We're a philanthropic agency," said Murra Foray. "Your 
case is special, though — " 

"I understand," he said gruffly. 
"You accept contributions." 

She nodded. "If the donor is 
able to give. We don't ask so 
much that you'll have to compromise your standard of living." 
But she named a sum that would 
force him to do just that if 
getting to Tunney 21 took any 
appreciable time. 

He stared at her unhappily. "I 
suppose it's worth it. I can always work, if I have to." 

"As a salesman?" she asked. 
"I'm afraid you'll find it difficult 
to do business with Godolphians.'* 

Irony wasn't called for at a 
time like this, he thought reproachfully. 

"Not just another salesman," 
he answered definitely. "I have 
special knowledge of customer 
reactions. I can ttll exactly — " 

He stopped abruptly. Was she 
batting him? For what reason? 
The instrument he called E>imanche was not known to the 
Galaxy at large. From the business angle, it would be poor 
policy to hand out that information at random. Aside from that, 
he needed every advantage he 
could get. Dimanche was his 
special advantage. 

"Anyway," he finished lamely. 




 



"I'm a first class engineer. I can 
always find something in that 
line." 

"A scientist, maybe," murmured Murra Foray. "But in this 
part of the Milky Way, an engineer is regarded as merely a 
technician who hasn't yet gained 
practical experience." She shook 
her head. "You'll do better as a 
salesman." 

He got up, glowering. "If that's 
all— " 

"It is. We'll keep you informed. 
Drop your contribution in the 
slot provided for that purpose as 
you leave." 
, A door, which he hadn't noticed in entering the counselling 
cubicle, swung open. The agency 
was efficient. 

"Remember," the counselor 
called out as he left, "identification is hard to work with. Don't 
accept a crude forgery." 

He didn't answer, but it was 
an idea worth considering. The 
agency was also eminently practical. 

The exit path guided him firmly to an inconspicuous and yet 
inescapable contribution station. 
He began to doubt the philanthropic aspect of the bureau. 

"T'VE got it," said Dimanche as 
Cassal gloomily counted out 
the sum the first counselor had 
named. 

"Got what?" asked Cassal. He 
DELAY IN TRANSIT 



rolled the currency into a neat 
bundle, attached his name, and 
dropped it into the chute. 

"The woman, Murra Foray, 
the first counselor. She's a Huntner." 

"What's a Huntner?" 

"A sub-race of men on the other 
side of the Galaxy. She was vocalizing about her home planet 
when I managed to locate her," 

"Any other information?" 

"None. Electronic guards were 
sliding into place as soon as I 
reached her. I got out as fast as 
I could." 

"I see." The significance of 
that, if any, escaped him. Nevertheless, it sounded depressing. 

"What I want to know is," said 
Dimanche, "why such precautions as electronic guards? What 
does Travelers Aid have that's so 
secret?" 
Cassal grunted and didn't answer. Dimanche could be annoyingly inquisitive at times. 

Cassal had entered one side of 
a block-square building. He came 
out on the other side. The agency 
was larger than he had thought. 
The old man was staring at a 
door as Cassal came out. He had 
apparently changed every sign in 
the building. His work finished, 
the technician was removing the 
visual projector from his head as 
Cassal came up to him. He 
turned and peered. 

"You stuck here, too?" he 

. 17 



asked in the uneven voice of the 
aged. 

"Stuck?" repeated Cassal. "I 
suppose you can call it that. I'm 
waiting for my ship." He frowned. 
He was the one who wanted to 
ask questions. "Why all the redecoration? I thought Travelers 
Aid was an old agency. Why did 
you change so' many signs? I 
could understand it if the agency 
were new." 

The old man chuckled. "Reorganization. The previous first 
counselor resigned suddenly, in 
the middle of the night, they say. 
The new one didn't like the name 
of the agency, -so she ordered it 
changed." 

She would do just that, thought 
Cassal. "What about this Murra 
Foray?" 

T^e old man winked mysteriously. He opened his mouth and 
then seemed overcome with senile fright. Hurriedly he shuffled 
away. 

Cassal gazed after him, baffled. The old man was afraid for 
his job, afraid of the first counselor. Why he should be, Cassal 
didn't know. He shrugged and 
went on. The agency was now in 
motion in his behalf, but he didn't 
intend to depend on that alone. 

"rpHE girl ahead of you is making unnecessary wriggling 
motions as she walks," observed 
Dimanche. "Several men are 



looking on with approval. I don't 
understand." 

Cassal glanced up. They 
walked that way back in good old 
L.A. A pang of homesickness 
swept through him. 

"Shut up," he growled plaintively. "Attend to the business at 
hand." 

"Business? Very well," said Dimanche. "Watch out for the 
transport tide." 

Cassal swerved back from the 
edge of the water. Murra Foray 
had been right. Godolphians 
didn't want or need his skills, 
at least not on terms that were 
acceptable to him. The natives 
didn't have to exert themselves. 
They lived oft" the income provided by travelers, with which 
the planet was abundantly supplied by ship after ship. 

Still, that didn"t alter his need 
for money. He walked the streets 
at random while Dimanche 
probed. 

"Ah!" 

"What is it?" 

"That man. He crinkles something in his hands. Not enough, 
he is sub vocalizing." 

"I know how he feels," commented Cassal. 

"Now h,is throat tightens. He 
bunches his muscles. 'I know 
where I can get more,' he tells 
himself. He is going there." 

"A sensible man," declared 
Cassal. "Follow him."

Boldly the man headed toward 
a section of the city which Cassal 
had not previously entered. He 
believed opportunity lay there. 
Not for everyone. The shrewd, 
observant, and the courageous 
could succeed if — The word that 
the quarry used was a slang term, 
unfamiliar to either Cassal or Dimanche. It didn't matter as long 
as it led to money. 

Cassal stretched his stride and 
managed to keep the man in 
sight. He skipped nimbly over 
the narrow walkways that curved 
through the great buildings. The 
section grew dingier as they proceeded. Not slums; not the showplace city frequented by travelers, 
either. 

Abruptly the man turned into 
a building. He was out of sight 
when Cassal reached the structure. 

He stood at the entrance and 
stared in disappointment. "Opportunities Inc.," Dimanche 
quoted softly in bis ear. "Science, 
thrills, chance. What does that 
mean?" 

"It means that we followed a 
gravity ghost!" 

"What's a gravity ghost?" 

"An unexplained phenomena," 
said Cassal nastily. "It affects the 
instruments of spaceships, giving 
the illusion of a massive dark 
body that isn't there." 

"But you're not a pilot. I don't 
understand." 



"You're not a very good pilot 
yourself. We followed the man to 
a gambling joint." 

"Gambling," mused Dimanche. 
"Well, isn't it an opportunity of 
a sort? Someone inside is thinking of the money he's winning." 

"The owner, no doubt." 

Dimanche was silent, investigating. "It is the owner," he confirmed finally. "Why not go in, 
anyway. It's raining. And they 
serve drinks." Left unstated was 
the admission that Dimanche was 
curious, as usual. 

CASSAL went in and ordered 
a drink. It was a variable 
place, depending on the spectator 
— bright, cheerful, and harmonious if he were winning, garish and 
depressingly vulgar if he were not. 
At the moment Cassal belonged 
to neither group. He reserved 
judgment. 

An assortment of gaming devices were in operation. One in 
particular seemed interesting. It 
involved the counting of electrons 
passing through an aperture, 
based on probability. 

"Not that," whispered Dimanche. "It's rigged." 

"But it's not necessary," Cassal 
murmured. "Pure chance alone is 
good enough." 

"They don't take chances, pure 
or adulterated. Look around. How 
many Godolphians do you see?" 
Cassal looked. Natives were 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



19 



not even there as servants. Strictly a clip joint, working travelers. 

Unconsciously, h e nodded. 
"That does it. -It's not the kind 
of opportunity I had in mind." 

"Don't be hasty," objected Dimanche. "Certain devices I can't 
control. There may be others in 
which my knowledge will help 
you. Stroll around and sample 
some games." 

Cassal equipped himself with 
a supply of coins and sauntered 
through the establishment, disbursing them so as to give 
himself the widest possible acquaintance with the laypljt. 

"That one," instructed Dimanche. 

It received a coin. In return, it 
rewarded him with a large shower 
of change. The money spilled to 
the^floor with a satisfying clatter. 
An audience gathered rapidly, ostensibly to help him pick up the 
coins. 

"There was a circuit in it," 
explained Dimanche. "I gave it a 
shot of electrons and it paid out." 

"Let's try it again," suggested 
Cassal. 

"Let's not," Dimanche said regretfully. "Look at the man on 
your right." 

Cassal did so. He jammed the 
money back in his pocket and 
stood up. Hastily, he began 
thrusting the money back into 
the machine. A large and very 
unconcerned man watched him. 

20 ■ 



"You get the idea," said Dimanche. "It paid off two months 
ago. It wasn't scheduled for another this year." Dimanche scrutinized the man in a multitude 
of ways while Cassal continued , 
play. "He's satisfied," was the 
report at last. "He doesn't detect 
any sign of crookedness." 

"Crooked ness ?' 1 

"On your part, that is. In the 
ethics of a gambling house, what's 
done to insure profit is merely 
prudence." 

THEY moved on to other 
games, though Cassal lost his 
briefly acquired enthusiasm. The 
possibility of winning seemed to 
grow more remote. 

"Hold it," said Dimanche. 
"Let's look into this." 

"Let me give you some advice,'' 
said Cassal. "This is one thing we 
can't win at. Every race in the 
Galaxy has a game like this. 
Pieces of pi asti c with values 
printed on them are distributed. 
The trick is to get certain arbitrarily selected sets of values in 
the plastics dealt to you. It seems 
simple, but against a skilled 
player a beginner can't win." 

"Every race in the Galaxy," 
mused Dimanche. "What do men 
call it?" "" 

"Cards," said Cassal, "though 
there are many varieties within 
that general classification." He 
launched into a detailed exposi
ALAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



tion of the subject. If it were 
something he was familiar with, 
all right, but a foreign deck and 
strange rules — 

Nevertheless. Dimanche was interested. They stayed and observed. 

The dealer was clumsy. His 
great hands enfolded the cards. 
Not a Godolphian nor quite human, he was an odd type, difficult to place. Physically burly, 
he wore a garment chiefly remarkable for its ill-fitting appearance. A hard round hat 



2o\ 



DELAY IN 1IANSII 



jammed closely over his skull 
completed the outfit. He was 
dressed in a manner that, somewhere in the Universe, was evidently considered the height of 
fashion. 

"It doesn't seem bad," commented Cassal. "There might be 
e chance." 

"Look around," said Dimanche. "Everyone thinks that. 
It's the classic struggle, person 
against person and everyone 
against the house. Naturally, the 
house doesn't lose." 

"Then why are w< wasting our 
time?" 

"Because I've got an idea."' 
said Dimanche. "Sit down and 
take a hand." 

"Make up your mind. You said 
the house doesn't lose." 

"The house hasn't played 
agaiffst us. Sit down. You get 
eight cards, with the option of 
two more. I'll tell you what to 
do." 

Cassal waited until a disconsolate player relinquished his 
seat and stalked moodily away. 
He played a few hands and bet 
small sums in accordance with 
Dimanche's instructions. He held 
his own and won insignificant 
amounts while learning. 

It was simple. Nine orders, or 
suits, of twenty-seven cards each. 
Each suit would build a different 
equation. The lowest hand was a 
quadratic. A cubic would beat it. 



All he had to do was remember 
his math, guess at what he didn't 
remember, and draw the right 
cards. 

"What's the highest possible 
hand?" asked Dimanche. There 
was a note of abstraction in his 
voice, as if he were paying more 
attention to something else. 

Cassal peeked at the cards that 
were face-down on the table. He 
shoved some money into the betting square in front of him and 
didn't answer. 

"You had it last time," said 
Dimanche. "A three dimensional 
encephalocurve. A tim< modulated brainwave. If you had bet 
right, you could have owned the 
house by now." 

"I did? Why didn't you tell 
me?" 

"Because you had it three successive times. The probabilities 
against that are astronomical. 
I've got to find out what's happening before- you start betting 
recklessly." 

"It's not the dealer," declared 
Cassal. "Look at those hands." 

They were huge hands, more 
suitable, seemingly, for crushing 
the life from some alien beast 
than the delicate manipulation 
of cards. Cassal continued to play, 
betting brilliantly by the only 
standard that mattered: he won. 

ONE player dropped out and 
was replaced by a recruit 



CrAlAXY SCIENCE FICTION 



from the surrounding crowd. 
Cassal ordered a drink. The 
waiter was placing it in his hand 
when Dimanche made a discovery. 

"I've got it I" 

A shout from Dimanche was 
roughly equivalent to a noiseless 
kick in the head. Cassal dropped 
the drink. The player next to him 
scowled but said nothing. The 
dealer blinked and went on dealing. 

"What have you got?" asked 
Cassal, wiping up the mess and 
trying to keep track of the cards. 

"How he fixes the deck," explained Dimanche in a lower and 
less painful tone. "Clever." 

Muttering, Casual shoved a bet 
in front of him. 

"Look at that hat," said Dimanche. 

"Ridiculous, isn't it? But -I see 
no reason to gloat because I have 
better taste." 

"That's not what I meant. 'It's 
pulled down low over his knobby 
ears and touches his jacket. His 
jacket rubs against his trousers, 
which in turn come in contact 
witli the stool on which he sits." 

"True," agreed Cassal, increasing his wager. "But except for his 
physique, I don't see anything 
unusual." 

"It's a circuit, a visual projector broken down into components. The hat is a command 
circuit which makes contact, via 



his clothing, with the broadcasting unit built into the chair. The 
existence of a visual projector is 
completely concealed." 

Cassal bit his lip and squinted 
at his cards. "Interesting. What 
does it have to do with anything?" 

"The deck," exclaimed Dimanche excitedly. "The backs 
are regular, printed with an intricate design. The front is a special 
plastic, susceptible to the influence of the visual projector. He 
doesn't need manual dexterity. 
Me can make any value appear 
on any card he wants. It will stay 
there until he changes it." 

Cassal picked up the cards. 
"I've got a Loreenaroo equation. 
Can he change that to anything 
else?" 

"He can, but he doesn't work 
that way. He decides before he 
deals who's going to get what. 
He concentrates on each card as 
he deals it. He can change a hand 
after a player gets it, but it 
wouldn't look good." 

"It wouldn't." Cassal wistfully 
watched the dealer rake in his 
wager. Hjs winnings were gone, 
plus. The newcomer to the game 
won. 

He started to get up. "Sit 
down," whispered Dimanche. 
"We're just beginning. Now that 
we know what he does and how 
he does it, we're going to take 
him." 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



THE next hand started in the 
familiar pattern, two cards of 
fairly good possibilities, a bet, 
and then another card. Cassal 
watched the dealer closely. His 
clumsiness was only superficial. 
At no time were the faces of the 
cards visible. The real skill was 
unobservable, of course — the swift 
bookkeeping that went on in his 
mind. A duplication in the hands 
of the players, for instance, would 
be ruinous. 

Cassal received the last card. 
"Bet high," said Dimanche. With 
trepidation, Cassal shoved the 
money into the betting area. 

The dealer glanced at his hand 
and started to sit down. Abruptly 
he stood up again. He scratched 
his cheek and stared puzzledly 
at the players around him. Gently 
he lowered himself onto the stool. 
Th* contact was even briefer. He 
stood up in indecision. An impatient murmur arose. He dealt 
himself a card, looked at it, and 
paid oft' all the way around. The 
players buzzed with curiosity. 

"What happened?" asked Cassal as the next hand started. 

"I induced a short in the 
circuit," said Dimanche. "He 
couldn't sit down to change the 
last card he got. He took a 
chance, as he had to, and dealt 
himself a card, anyway." 

"But he paid off without asking to see what we had." 

"It was the only thing he could 



do,** explained Dimanche. "He 
had duplicate cards." 

The dealer was scowling. He 
didn't seem quite so much at 
ease. The cards were dealt and 
the betting proceeded almost as 
usual. True, the dealer was nervous. He couldn't sit down and 
stay down. He was sweating. 
Again he paid off. Cassal won 
heavily and he was not the only 
one. 

The crowd around them grew 
almost in a rush. There is an 
indefinable sense that tells one 
gambler when another is winning. 

This time the dealer stood up. 
His leg contacted the stool occa- v 
sionally. He jerked it away each 
tim* he dealt to himself. At the 
last card he hesitated. It was 
amazing how much he could 
sweat. He lifted a corner of the 
cards. Without indicating what 
he had drawn, determinedly and 
deliberately he sat down. The 
chair broke. The dealer grinned 
weakly as a waiter brought him 
another stool. 

"They still think it may be a 
defective circuit," whispered Dimanche. 

The dealer sat down and 
sprang up from the new chair 
in one motion. He gazed bitterly 
at the players and paid them. 

"He had a blank hand," explained Dimanche. "He made 
contact with the broadcasting 
circuit long enough to erase, but 



24 




 



not long enough to put anything 
in its place." 

The dealer adjusted his coat. 
"I have a nervous disability," he 
declared thickly. "If you'll pardon rne for a few minutes while 
I take a treatment — " 

"Probably going to consult 
with the manager," observed Cassal. 

"He is the manager. He's talking with the owner." 
"Keep track of him.** 

A blonde, pretty, perhaps even 
Earth - type human, smiled 
and wriggled closer to Cassal. He 
smiled back. 

"Don't fall for it," warned Dimanche. "She's an undercover 
agent for the house." 

Cassal looked her over carefully. "Not much under cover." 

"But if she should discover — " 

"Don't be stupid. She'll never 
guess you exist. There's a small 
lump behind my ear and a small 
round tube cleverly concealed 
elsewhere." 

"All right," sighed Dimanche 
resignedly. "I suppose people will 
always be a mystery to me." 

The dealer reappeared, followed by an unobtrusive man 
who carried a new stool. The 
dealer looked subtly different, 
though he was the same person. 
It took a close inspection to determine what the difference was. 
His clothing was new, unrum


pled, unmarked by perspiration. 
During his brief absence, he had 
been furnished with new visual 
projector equipment, and it had 
been thoroughly checked out. 
The house intended to locate the 
source of the disturbance. 

Mentally, Cassal counted his 
assets. He was solvent again, but 
in other ways his position was 
not so good. 

"Maybe," he suggested, "we 
should leave. With no further interference from us, they might 
believe defective equipment is 
the cause of their losses." 

"Maybe." replied Dimanche, 
"you think the crowd around us 
is composed solely of patrons?" 

"I see," said Cassal soberly. 

He stretched his legs. The 
crowd pressed closer, uncommonly aggressive and ill-tempered 
for mere spectators. He decided 
against leaving. 

"Let's resume play." The dealer-manager smiled blandly at 
each player. He didn't suspect 
any one person — yet. 

"He might be using an honest 
deck," said Cassal hopefully. 

"They don't have that kind,'* 
answered Dimanche. He added 
absently : "During his conference 
with the owner, he was given 
authority to handle the situation 
in any way he sees fit." 

Bad, but not too bad. At least 
Cassal was opposing someone 
who had authority to let him 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



25 



k *p his winnings, ii he could be 
convinced. 

The dealer deliberately sat 
down on the stool. Testing. He 
could endure the charge that 
trickled through him. The bland 
smile spread into a triumphant 
one. 

"While he was gone, he took a 
sedative," analyzed Dimanche. 
"He also had the strength of the 
broadcasting circuit reduced. He 
thinks that will do it." 

"Sedatives wear oft," said Cassal. "By the time he knows it's 
me, see that it has worn off. Mess 
him up." 

THE game went on. The situation was too much for the 
others. They played poorly and 
bet atrociously, on purpose. One 
by one they lost and dropped out. 
They % wanted badly to win. but 
they wanted to live even more. 

The joint was jumping, and so 
was the dealer again. Sweat 
rolled down his face and there 
were tears in his eyes. So much 
liquid began to erode his fixed 
smile. He kept replenishing it 
from some inner source of determination. 

Cassal looked up. The crowd 
had drawn back, or had been 
forced back by hirelings who 
mingled with them. He was alone 
with the dealer at the table. 
Money was piled high around 
him. It was more than he needed. 



more than he wanted. 

"I suggest one last hand," said 
the dealer - manager, grimacing. 
It sounded a little stronger than a 
suggestion. 

Cassal nodded. 

"For a substantial sum." said 
the dealer, naming it. 

Miraculously, it was an amount 
that equaled everything Cassal 
had. Again Cassal nodded. B 

"Pressure," muttered Cassal to 
Dimanche. "The sedative has 
worn off. He's back at the level 
at which he started. Fry him if 
you have to." 

The cards came out slowly. 
The dealer was jittering as he 
dealt. Soft music was lacking, but 
not the motions that normally 
accompanied it. Cassal couldn't 
believe that cards could be so 
bad. Somehow the dealer was rising to the occasion. Rising and 
sitting. 

"There's a nerve in your body," 
Cassal began con versatioua Uy, 
"which, if It were overloaded, 
would cause you to drop dead." 

The dealer didn't examine his 
cards. He didn't have to. "In that 
event, someone would be arrested 
for murder," he said. "You." 

That was the wrong tack; the 
humanoid had too much courage. 
Cassal passed his hand over his 
eyes. "You can't do this to men. 
but, strictly speaking, the dealer's 
not human. Try suggestion on 
him. Make him change the cards. 



GALAXY SCIENCE MICTION 



Play him like a piano. Pizzicato 
in) the nerve strings." 

Dimanche didn't answer: presumably he was busy scrambling 
the circuits. 

The dealer stretched out his 
hand. It never reached the cards. 
Danger: Dimanche at work. The 
smile dropped from his face. 
What remained was pure anguish. He was too dry- for tears. 
Smoke curled up faintly from his 
jacket. 

"Hot. isn't it?"' asked Cassal. 
"It might be cooler if you took off 
your cap." 

The cap tinkled to the floor. 
The mechanism in it was destroyed. What the cards were, they 
were. Now they couldn't be 
changed. 

"That's better," said Cassal. 

[IE glanced at his hand. In the 
interim, it had changed 
slightly. Dimanche had got there. 

The dealer examined his cards 
one by one. His face changed 
color. He sat utterly still on a 
cool stool. 

"You win." he said hopelessly. 

"Let's see what you have.'* 

The dealer - manager roused 
himself. "You won. That"? good 
enough for you. isn't it?" 

Cassal shrugged. "You have 
Bank of the Galaxy service here. 
I'll deposit my money with them 
before you pick up your cards." 

The dealer nodded unhappily 



and summoned an assistant. The 
crowd, which had anticipated violence, slowly began to drift away. 

"What did you do?" asked Cassal silently. 

"Men have no shame," sighed 
Dimanche. "Some humanoids do. 
The dealer was one who did. I 
forced him to project onto his 
cards something that wasn't a suit 
at all." 

"Embarrassing if that got out.'* 
agreed Cassal. "What did you 
project?" 

Dimanche told him. Cussnl 
blushed, which was unusual for 
a man. 

The dealer - manager returned 
and the transaction was completed. His money was safe in 
the Bank of the Galaxy. 

"Hereafter, you're not welcome," said the dealer morosely. 
"Don't come back." 

Cassal picked up the cards 
without looking at them. "And no 
accidents after I leave,'' he paid, 
extending the cards face-down. 
The manager took them and 
trembled. 

"He's an honorable humanoid, 
in his own way." whispered Dimanche. "I think you're safe." 

It was time to leave. "One 
question." Cassal called back. 
"What do you call this game?" 

Automatically the dealer 
started to answer. "Why everyone knows . . ." Hp sat down, his 
mouth open.

It was more than time to leave. 

Outside, he hailed an air taxi. 
r*&> point in tempting the management. 

"Look," said Dimanche as the 
cab rose from the surface of the 
transport tide. 

A technician with a visual projector was at work on the sign 
in front of the gaming house. 
Huge words took shape: warning NO TELEPATHS ALLOWED. 

There were no such things anywhere, but now there were rumors of them. 

A RRIVING at the habitat wing 
of the hotel. Cassal went directly to his room. He awaited 
the delivery of the equipment he 
had ordered and checked through 
it thoroughly. Satisfied that everything was there, he estimated 
"the sTze of the room. Too small* 
for his purpose. 

He picked up the intercom and 
dialed Services. "Put a Life Stage 
Cordon around my suite," he said 
briskly. 

The face opposite his went 
blank. "But you're an Earthman. 
I thought- — " 

"I know more about my own 
requirements than your Life 
Stage Bureau. Earth men do have 
Tffe stages. You know the penalty 
if you refuse that service." 

There were some races who 
•went without sleep for five 
months and then had to make up 



for it. Others grew vestigial wings 
for brief periods and had to fly 
with them or die; reduced gravity 
would suffice for that. Still 
others — 

But the one common feature 
was always a critical time in 
which certain conditions were 
necessary. Insofar as there was a 
universal law, from one end of 
the Galaxy to the other, this was 
it: The habitat hotel had to furnish appropriate conditions for 
the maintenance of any life-form 
that requested it. 

The Godolphian disappeared 
from the screen. When he came 
back, he seemed disturbed. 

"Yqu spoke of a suite. I find 
that you're listed as occupying 
one room." 

"I am. It's too smali. Convert 
the rooms around me into a 
suite." 

"That's very expensive." 

"I'm aware of that. Check the 
Bank of the Galaxy for my credit 
rating." 

He watched the process take 
place. Service would be amazingly good from now on. 

"Your suite will be converted 
in about two hours. The Life 
Stage Cordon will begin as soon 
after that as you want. If you 
tell me how long you'll need it, 
I can make arrangements now." 

"About ten hours is all I'll 
need." Cassal rubbed his jaw reflectively. "One more thing. Put 



14 




 



a perpetual service at the spaceport. If a ship comes in bound for 
Tunney 21 or the vicinity of it, 
get accommodations on it for me. 
And hold it until I get ready, no 
matter what it costs." 

He flipped off the intercom and 
promptly went to sleep. Hours 
later, he was awakened by a faint 
hum. The Life Stage Cordon had 
just been snapped safely around 
his newly created suite. 

"Now what?" asked Dimanche. 

"I need an identification tab." 

"You do. And forgeries are expensive and generally crude, as 
that Huntner woman, Murra 
Foray, observed." 

/VASSAL glanced at the equip^* men. "Expensive, yes. Not 
crude when we *do it." 

"We forge it?" Dimanche was 
incredulous. 

"That's what I said. Consider 
it this way. I've seen my tab a 
cbuntless number of times. If I 
tried to draw it as I remember 
it, it would be inept and wouldn't 
pass. Nevertheless, that memory 
is in my mind, recorded in neuronic chains, exact and accurate." 
He paused significantly. "You 
have access to that memory." 

"At least partially. But what 
good does that do?" 

"Visual projector and plastic 
which will take the imprint. I 
think hard about the identification as I remember it. You record 



and feed it back to me while I 
concentrate on projecting it on 
the plastic. After we get it down, 
we change the chemical composition of the plastic. It will then 
pass everything except destructive analysis, and they don't often 
do that." 

Dimanche was silent. "Ingenious," was its comment. "Part of 
that we can manage, the official 
engraving, even the electron 
stamp. That, however, is "gross 
detail. The print of the brain area 
is beyond our capacity. We can 
put down what you remember, 
and you remember what you saw. 
You didn't see fine enough, 
though. The general area will be 
recognizable, but not the fine 
structure, nor the charges stored 
there nor their interrelationship." 

"But we've got to do it," Cassal insisted, pacing about nervously. 

"With more equipment to 
probe — " 

"Not a chance. I got one Life 
Stage Cordon on a bluff. If I ask 
for another, they'll look it up and 
refuse." 

"AH right," said Dimanche, 
humming. The mechanical attempt at music made Cassal's 
head ache. "I've got an idea. 
Think about the identificaticn 
tab." 

Cassal thought. 

"Enough," said Dimanche. 
"Now poke yourself." 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



! ''Where?" 

"Everywhere," replied D » manche irritably. "One place at 
a time." 

Cassal did so, though it soon 
became monotonous. 

Dimanche stopped him. "Just 
above your right knee." 

"What above my right knee?" 

"The principal access to that 
part of your brain we're concerned with," said Dimanche. 
"We can't ph otom e asure your 
brain the way it was originally 
done, but we can investigate it 
remotely. The results will be simplified, naturally. Something like 
a scale model as compared to the 



original. A more apt comparison 
might be that of a relief map to 
an actual locality." 

"Investigate it remotely?" muttered Cassal. A horrible suspicion 
touched his consciousness. He 
jerked away from that touch. 
"What does that mean?" 

"What it sounds like. Stimulus 
and response. From that I can 
construct an accurate chart of 
the proper portion of your brain. 
Our probing instruments will be 
crude out of necessity, but effective." 

"I've already visualized those 
probing instruments," said Cassal worriedly. "Maybe we'd bet


30 




 



tor work first on the official 
engraving and the electron stamp, 
while I'm still fresh. I have a 
feeling . . ." 

"Excellent suggestion," said Diraanche. 

Cassal gathered the articles 
slowly. His lighter would burn 
and it would also cut. He needed 
a heavy object to pound with. A 
violent irritant for the nerve endings. Something to freeze his 
flesh . . . 

Dimanche interrupted: "There 
are also a few glands we've got to 
pick up. See if there's a stimi in 
the room." 

"Stimi? Oh yes, a stimulator. 
Never use the damned things." 
But he was going to. The next few 
hours weren't going to be pleasant. Nor dull, either. 

Life could be difficult on Godolph. 

A S soon as the Life Stage Cordon came down, Cassal called 
for a doctor. The native looked at 
him professionally. 

"Is this a part of the Earth 
life process?" he asked incredulously. Gingerly, he touched the 
swollen and lacerated leg. 

Cassal nodded wearily. "A 
matter of life and death," he 
croaked. 

"If it is, then it is," said the 
doctor, shaking his head. "I, for 
one, am glad to be a Godolphian 

"To each his own habitat," 



Cassal quoted the motto of the 
hotel. 

Godolphians were clumsy, goodnatured caricatures ef seals. 
There was nothing wrong with 
their medicine, however. In a 
matter of minutes he was feeling 
better. By the time the doctor 
left, the swelling had subsided 
and the open wounds were fast 
closing. 

Eagerly, he examined the identification tab. As far as he could 
tell, it was perfect. Wr^at the 
scanner would reveal was, of 
course, another matter. He had to 
check that as best he could without exposing himself. 

Services came up to the suite 
right after he laid the intercom 
down. A machine was placed over 
his head and the identification 
slipped into the slot. The code 
on the tab was noted; the 
machine hunted and found the 
corresponding brain area. Structure was mapped, impulses recorded, scrambled, converted into 
a ray of light which danced over 
a film. 

The identification tab was similarly recorded. There was now a 
means of comparison. 

Fingerprints couM be duplicated — that is, if the race in 
question had fingers. Every intelligence, however much it differed from its neighbors, had a 
brain, and tampering with that 
brain was easily detected. Each 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



31 



identification tab carried a psychometric number which corresponded to the total personality. 
Alteration of any part of the 
brain could only subtract from 
personality index. 

The technician removed the 
identification and gave it to Cassal. "Where shall I send the 
strips?" 

"You don't," said Cassal. "I 
have a private message to go with 
them." 

"But that will invalidate the 
process." 

'T know. This isn't a formal 
contract." 

Removing the two strips and 
handing them to Cassal, the technician wheeled the machine away. 
After due thought, Cassal composed the message. 

Travelers Aid Bureau 
Hurra Foray, first counselor; 

If you were considering another 
identification tab for me, don't. As 
you can sse, I've located the missing 
item. 

He attached the message to 
the strips and dropped them into 
the communication chute. 

TTE was wiping his whiskers 
away when the answer came. 
Hastily he finished and wrapped 
himself, noting but not approving 
the amused glint in her eyes as 
she watched. His morals were his 
own, wherever he went. 



"Denton Cassal," she said. "A 
wonderful job. The two strips 
were in register within one per 
cent. The best previous forgery 
I've seen was six per cent, and 
that was merely a lucky accident. 
It couldn't be duplicated. Let me 
congratulate you." 

His dignity was professional, 
"I wish you weren't so fond of 
that word 'forgery.' I told you I 
mislaid the tab. As soon as I 
found it, I sent you proof. I want 
to get to Tunney 21. I'm willing 
to do anything I can to speed up 
the process." 

Her laughter tinkled. "You 
don't have to tell me how you did 
it or where you got it. I'm inclined to think you made it. You 
understand that I'm not concerned with legality as such. 
From time to time the agency 
has to furnish missing documents. If there's a better way 
than we have, I'd like to kno.w 
it." 

He sighed and shook his head. 
For some reason, his heart was 
beating fast. He wanted to say 
more, but there was nothing to 
say. 

When he failed to respond, she 
leaned toward him. "Perhaps 
you'll discuss this with m". At 
greater length." 

'At the agency?" 

She looked at him in surprise. 
"Have you been sleeping? The 
agency is closed for the day. The 




 



first counselor can't work all 
the time, you know." 

Sleeping? He grimaced at the 
remembrance of the self-administered beating. No, he hadn't 
been sleeping. He brushed the 
thought aside and boldly named 
a place. Dinner was acceptable. 

Dimanche waited until the 
screen was dark. The words were 
carefully chosen. 

"Did you notice,** he asked, 
"that there was no apparent 
change in clothing and makeup, 
yet she seemed younger, more 
attractive?" 

'*I didn't think you could trace 
her that far." 

"I can't. I looked at her 
through your eyes." 

"Don't trust my reaction," advised Cassal, "Its likely to be 
subjective." 

"I don't," answered Dimanche. 
"It is." 

Cassal hummed thoughtfully. 
Dimanche was a business neurological instrument. It didn't follow that it was an expert in 
human psychology. 

/""ASSAL stared at the woman 
^coming toward him. Center©f-the-Galaxy fashion. Decadent, 
of course, or maybe ultra-civilized. As an Outsider, he wasn't 
sure which. Whatever it was, it 
did to the human body what 
should have been done long ago, 
And this body wasn't exactly 



human. The subtle skirt of proportions betrayed it as an offshoot 
or deviation from the human race. 
Some of the new sub - races 
stacked up against the original 
stock much in th*same way CroMagnons did against Nriitnlirthals, in beauty, at least. 

Dimanche spoke a single syllable and subsided, an event 
Cassal didn't notice. His consciousness was focused on another discovery : the woman was 
Murra Foray. 

He knew vaguely that the first 
counselor was not necessarily 
what she had seemed that first 
time at the agency. That she was 
capable of such a metamorphosis 
was hard to believe, though 
pleasant to accept- His attitude 
must have shown on his face. 

"Please," said Murra Foray. 
"I'm a Huntncr. We're adept at 
camouflage." 

"Huntner," lie repeated blankly. "I knew that. But what's a 
Huntner?" 

She wrinkled her lovely nose 
at the question. "I didn't expect 
you to ask that. I won't answer 
it now." She came closer. "I 
thought you'd ask which was tbt 
camouflage — the person you see 
here, or the one at the Bureau?" 

He never remembered the reply he made. It must have Utn 
satisfactory, for she smiled and 
drew her fragile wrap closer. The 
reservations were waiting. 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



Dtmanche seized the opportunity to speak. "There's something phony about her. I don't 
understand it and I don't like it." 

"You," said Cassal. "are a 
machine. You don't have to like 
it." * 

"That's what I mean. You have 
to like it. You have no choice." 

Murra Foray looked back 
questioningly. Cassal hurried to 
her side. 

The evening passed swiftly. 
Food that he ate and didn't 
taste. Music he heard and didn't 
listen to. Geometric light fugues 
that were seen and not observed. 
Liquor that he drank — and here 
the sequence ended, in the complicated chemistry of Godolphian 
stimulants. 

Cassal reacted to that smooth 
* liquid, though his physical reactions were not slowed. Certain 
mental centers were depressed, 
others left wide open, subject to 
acceleration at whatever speed he 
demanded. 

Murra Foray, in his eyes at 
least, might look like a dream, the 
kind men have and never talk 
about. She was, however, interetf:ed solely in her work, or so it 
seemed. 

"|^ODOLPH is a nice place." 
^* she said, toying with a 
drink, "if you like rain. The natives seem happy enough. But the 
Galaxy is big and there are lots 



of strange planets in it, each of 
which seems ideal to those who 
are adapted to it. I don't have 
to tell you what happens when 
people travel. They get stranded. 
It's not the time spent in actual 
flight that's important; it's waiting for the right ship to show up 
and then having all the necessary 
documents. Believe me, that can 
be important, as you found out." 

He nodded. He had. 

"That's the origin of Travelers 
Aid Bureau," she continued. "A 
loose organization, propagated 
mainly by example. Sometimes 
it's called Star Travelers Aid. It 
may have other names. The aim, 
however, is always the same: to 
see that stranded persons get 
where they want to go." 

She looked at him wistfully, 
appealingly. "That's why I'm interested in your method of creating identification tabs. It's the 
thing most commonly lost. 
Stolen, if you prefer the truth." 

She seemed to anticipate his 
question. "How can anyone use 
another's identification? It can be 
done under certain circumstances. 
By neural lobotomy, a portion of 
one brain may be made to match, 
more or less exactly, the code 
area of another brain. The person 
operated on suffers a certain loss 
of function, of course. How great 
that loss is depends on the degree of similarity between the 
two brain areas before the opera- ^ 



M 




 



tion took place." 

She ought to know, and he was 
inclined to believe her. Still, it 
didn't sound feasible. 

"You haven't accounted for 
the psychometric index," he said. 

"I thought you'd see it. That's 
diminished, too." 

Logical enough, though not a 
pretty picture. A genius could always be made into an average 
man or lowered to the level of an 
idiot. There was no operation, 
however, that could raise an idiot 
to the level of a genius. 

The scramble for the precious 
identification tabs went on, from 
the higher to the lower, a game 
of musical chairs with grim overtones. 

She smiled gravely. "You 
haven't answered my implied 
question." 

The company that employed 
him wasn't .anxious to let the 
secret of Dimanche get out. They 
didn't sell the instrument; they 
made it for their own use. It was 
an advantage over their competitors they intended to keep. Even 
on his recommendation, they 
wouldn't sell to the agency. 

Moreover, it wouldn't help 
Travelers Aid Bureau if they did. 
Since she was first counselor, it 
was probable that she'd be the 
one to use it. She couldn't make 
identification for anyone except 
herself, and then only if she developed exceptional skill. 



The alternative was to surgery 
it in and out of whoever needed 
it. When that happened, secrecy 
was gone. Travelers couldn't be 
trusted. 

TTE shook his head. "It's an ap■H pealing idea, but I'm afraid 
I can't help you." 

"Meaning you won't." 

This was intriguing. Now it 
was the agency, not he, who 
wanted help. 

"Don't overplay it," cautioned 
Dimanche, who had been consistently silent. 

She leaned forward attentively. 
He experienced an uneasy moment. Was it possible she had 
noticed his private conversation? 
Of course not. Yet — 

"Please," she said, and the tone 
allayed his fears. "There's an 
emergency situation and I've got 
to attend to it. Will you go with 
me?" She smiled understanding^ 
at his quizzical expression. "Travelers Aid is always having 
emergencies." 

She was rising. "It's too late to 
go to the Bureau. My place has 
a number of machines with which 
I keep in touch with the spaceport." 

"I wonder," said Dimanche 
puzzledly. "She doesn't subvocalize at all. I haven't been able 
to get a line On her. I'm certain 
she didn't receive any sort of call. 
Be careful. 



B'ELAY IN TRANSIT

**This might be a trick." 

"Interesting," said Cassal. He 
wasn't in the mood to discuss it. 

Her habitation was luxurious, 
though Cassal wasn't impressed. 
Luxury was found everywhere in 
the Universe. Huntner women 
weren't. He watched as she adjusted the machines grouped at 
one side of the room. She spoke 
in a low voice; he couldn't distinguish words. She actuated 
levers, pressed buttons: impedimenta of communication. 

At last she finished. "I'm tired. 
Will you wait till I change?" 

Inarticulately, he nodded. 

"I think her 'emergency' was a 
fake," said Dimanche flatly as 
soon as she left. "I'm positive she 
wasn't operating the communicator. She merely went through the 
motions." 

"Motions," murmured Cassal 
dreamily, leaning back. "And 
wluit motions." 

*Tve been watching her," said 
Dhnanche. "She frightens me," 

"I've been watching her, too. 
Maybe in a different way." 

"Get out of here while you 
can." warned Dimanche. "She's 
dangerous." 

TMj OMENTARILY, Cassal con■f"-*- sidered it. Dimanche had 
never failed him. He ought to 
follow that advice. And yet there 
war. another explanation. 

"Look," said Cassal. "A ma


chine is a machine. But among 
humans there are men and women. What seems dangerous to 
you may be merely a pattern of 
normal behavior . . He broke 
off. Murra Foray had entered. 

Strictly from the other side of 
the Galaxy, which she was. A 
woman can be slender and still 
be womanly beautiful, without 
being obvious about it. Not that 
Murra disdained the obvious, 
technically. But he could see 
through technicalities. 

The tendons in his hands ached 
and his mouth was dry, though 
not with fear. An urgent ringing 
pounded in his ears. He shook it 
out of his head and got up. 

She came to him. 

The ringing was still in his 
ears. It wasn't a figment of imagination; it was a real voice — that 
of Dimanche, howling: 

"Huntner! It's a word variant. 
In their language it means Hunter. She can hear me/" 

"Hear you?" repeated Cassal 
vacantly. 

She was kissing him. 

"A descendant of carnivores. 
An audio - sensitive. She's been 
listening to you and me all the 
time." 

"Of coui'se I have, ever since 
the first interview at the bureau." 
said Murra. "In the beginning I 
couldn't see what value it was, 
but you convinced me." She laid 
her hand gently over his eyes. "I 



3f 




 



hate to do this to you, dear, but 
I've got to have Dimanche." 

She had been smothering him 
with caresses. Now, deliberately, 
she began smothering him in actuality. 

Cassal had thought he was an 
athlete. For an Earthman, he 
was. Murra Foray, however, was 
a Huntner, which meant hunter — 
a descendant of incredibly strong 
carnivores. 

He didn't have a chance. He 
knew that when he couldn't 
budge her hands and he fell into 
the airless blackness of space. 

A LONE and naked, Cassal 
-f*- awakened. He wished he 
hadn't. He turned over and, 
though he tried hard not to. 
promptly woke up again. His 
body was willing to sleep, but his 
mind was panicked and disturbed. About what, he wasn't 
sure. 

He sat up shakily and held 
his roaring head in his hands. He 
ran aching fingers through his 
hair. He stopped. The lump behind his ear was gone. 

*'Dimanche!" he called, and 
looked at his abdomen. 

There was a thin scar, healing 
visibly before his eyes. 

"Dimanche!" he cried again. 
"Dimanche!" 

There was no answer. Dimanche was no longer with him. 

He staggered to his feet and 



stared at the wall. She'd been 
kind enough to return him to his 
own rooms. At length he gathered 
enough strength to rummage 
through his belongings. Nothing 
was missing. Money, identification — all were there. 

He could go to the police. He 
grimaced as he thought of it. The 
neighborly Godolphian police 
were hardly a match for the 
Huntner; she'd fake them out of 
their skins. 

He couldn't prove she'd taken 
Dimanche. Nothing else normally 
considered valuable was missing. 
Besides, there might even be a 
local prohibition against Dimanche. Not by name, of course; 
but they could dig up an ancient 
ordinance — invasion of privacy 
or something like that. Anything 
would do if it gave them an opportunity to confiscate the device 
for intensive study. 

For the police to believe his 
story was the worst that could 
happen. They might locate Dimanche, but he'd never get it. 

He smiled bitterly and the effort hurt. "Dear," she had called 
him as she had strangled and 
beaten him into unconsciousness. 
Afterward singing, very likely, as 
she had sliced the little instrument out of him. 

He could picture her not very 
remote ancestors springing from 
cover and overtaking a fleeing 
herd— 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



37 



No use pursuing that line of 
thought. 

Why did she want Dimanehe? 
She had hinted that the agency 
wasn't always concerned with 
legality as such. He could believe . 
her. If she wanted it for making 
identification tabs, she'd soon find 
that it was useless. Not that that 
was much comfort — she wasn't 
likely to return Dimanehe after 
she'd made that discovery. 

FOR that matter, what was the 
purpose of T ravelers Aid 
Bureau? It was a front for another kind of activity. Philanthropy had nothing to do with it. 

If he still had possession of 
Dimanehe, he'd be able to find 
out. Everything seemed to hinge 
on that. With it, he was nearly a 
superman, able to hold his own in 
practically all situations — anything that didn't involve a Huntner woman, that is. 

Without it — well, Tunney 21 
was still far away. Even if he 
should manage to get there without it, his mission on the planet 
was certain to fail. 

He dismissed the idea of trying 
to recover it immediately from 
Murra Foray. She was an audiosensitive. At twenty feet, unaided, she could hear a heartbeat, 
the internal noise muscles made 
in sliding over each other. With 
Dimanehe, she could hear electrons rustling. As an antagonist 



she was altogether too formidable. 

TTE began pulling on his clothing, wincing as he did so. The 
alternative was to make another 
Dimanehe. // he could. It would 
be a tough job even for a neuronic expert familiar with the process. He wasn't that expert, but it 
still had to be done. 

The new instrument would 
have to be better than the original. Maybe not such a slick machine, but more comprehensive. 
More wallop. He grinned as he 
thought hopefully about giving 
Murra Foray a surprise. 

Ignoring his aches and pains, 
he went right to work. With 
money not a factor, it was an 
easy matter to line up the best 
electronic and neuron concerns on 
Godolph. Two were put on a 
standby basis. When he gave 
them plans, they were to rush 
construction at all possible speed. 

Each concern was to build a 
part of the new instrument. 
Neither part was of value without the other. The slow-thinking 
Godolphians weren't likely to 
make the necessary mental connection between the seemingly 
unrelated projects. 

He retired to his suite and began to draw diagrams. It was 
harder than he thought. He knew 
the principles, but the actual details were far more complicated 



3i 




 



than he remembered. 

Functionally, the Dimancfie instrument was divided into three 
main phases. There was a brain 
and memory unit that operated 
much as the human counterpart 
did. Unlike the human brain, 
however, it had no body to control, hence more of it was availa b 1 e for thought processes. 
Entirely neuronic in construction, 
it was far smaller than an electronic brain of the same capacity. 

The second function was electronic, akin to radar. Instead of 
material objects, it traced and 
recorded distant nerve impulses. 
It could count the heartbeat, 
measure the rate of respiration, 
was even capable of approximate 
analysis of the contents of the 
bloodstream . Properly focused 
on the nerves of tongue, lips or 
larynx, it transmitted that data 
back to the neuronic brain, which 
then reconstructed it into speech. 
Lip reading, after a fashion, carried to the ultimate. 

Finally, there was the voice of 
Dimanche, a speaker under the 
control of the neuronic brain. 

For convenience of installation 
in the body, Dimanche was packaged in two units. The larger 
package was usually surgeried 
into the abdomen. The small one, 
containing the speaker, was attached^ To the skull just behind 
the Oar. It worked by bone conduction, allowing silent commun


ication between operator and 
instrument. A real convenience. 

It wasn't enough to know this, 
as Cassal did. He'd talked to the 
company experts, had seen the 
symbolical drawings, the plans 
for an improved version. He needed something better than the best 
though, that had been planned. 

The drawback was this: Dimanche was powered directly by 
the nervous system of the body in 
which it was housed. Against 
Murra Foray, "he'd be overmatched. She was stronger than 
he physically, probably also in 
the production of nervous energy. 

One solution was to make 
available to the new instrument 
a larger fraction of the neural 
currents of the body. That wns 
dangerous— a slight miscalculation and the user was dead. Vet 
he had to have an instrument 
that would overpower her. 

Cassal rubbed his eyes wearily. 
How could he find some way ot" 
supplying additional power? 

Abruptly, Cassal sat up. That 
was the way, of course — an auxiliary power pack that need not 
be surgeried into his body, extra 
power that he would use only in 
emergencies.

tion via subvocalized thoughts. 

It was easier for Cassal to conceive this idea than to engineer 
4*. At the end of the first day, he 
knew it would be a slow process. 

Twice -he postponed deadlines 
to the manufacturing concerns 
he'd engaged. He locked himself 
in his rooms and took Anti-Sleep 
against the doctor's vigorous protests. In one week he had the 
necessary drawings, crude but 
legible. An expert would have to 
make innumerable corrections, 
but the intent was plain. 

One week. During that time 
Murra Foray would be growing 
hourly more proficient in the use 
of Dimanche. 

CASSAL followed the neuronics 
expert groggily, seventy-two 
hours sleep still clogging his reactions. Not that he hadn't needed sleep after that week. The 
Godolphian showed him proudly 
through the shops, though he 
wasn't at all interested in their 
achievements. The only noteworthy aspect was the grand scale 
of their architecture. 

"We did it, though I don't 
think we'd have taken the job if 
we'd known how hard it was going to be." the neuronics expert 
chattered. "It works exactly as 
you specified. We had to make 
substitutions, of course, but you 
understand that was inevitable." 
He glanced anxiously at Cas


sal, who nodded. That was to be 
expected. Components that were 
common on Earth wouldn't necessarily be available here. Still, 
any expert worth his pay could 
always make the proper combinations and achieve the same results. 

Inside the lab, Cassal frowned. 
"I thought you were keeping my 
work separate. What is this planetary drive doing here?" 

The Godolphian spread his 
broad hands and looked hurt. 
"Planetary drive?" He tried to 
laugh. "This is the instrument 
you ordered!" 

Cassal started. It was supposed 
to fit under a flap of skin behind 
his ear. A Three World saurian 
couldn't carry it. 

He turned savagely on the expert. "I told you it had to be 
small." 

"But it is. I quote your orders 
exactly: 'I'm not familiar with 
your system of measurement, but 
make it tiny, very tiny. Figure 
the size you think it will have to 
be and cut it in half. And than 
cut that in half.' This is the fraction remaining." 

It certainly was. Cassal glanced 
at the Godolphian's hands. Excellent, for swimming. No wonder 
they built on a grand scale. 
Broad, blunt, webbed hands 
weren't exactly suited for precision work. 

Valueless. Completely value



 



less. He knew now what he would 
find at the other lab. He shook 
his head in dismay, personally 
saw to it that the instrument was 
destroyed. He paid for the work 
and retrieved the plans. 

Back in his rooms again, he sat 
and thought. It was still the only 
solution. If the Godolphians 
couldn't do it, he'd have to find 
some race that could. He grabbed 
the intercom and jangled it savagely. In half an hour he had a 
dozen leads. 

The best seemed to be the 
Spirella. A small, inseetlike race, 
about three feet tall, they were 
supposed to have excellent manual dexterity, and were technically advanced. They sounded as if 
they were acquainted with the 
necessary fields. Three lightyears 
away, they could be reached by 
readily available local transportation within the day. Their idea 
of what was small was likely to 
coincide with his. 

He didn't bother to pack. The 
suite would remain his headquarters. Home was where his enemies 
were. 

He made a mental correction — 
enemy. 

Tl E rubbed his sensitive ear, 
grateful for the discomfort. 
His stomach was sore, but it 
wouldn't be for long. The Spirella 
had made the new instrument 
just as he had wanted it. They 



had built an even better auxiliary 
power unit than he had specified. 
He fingered the flat cases in his 
pocket. In an emergency, he 
could draw on these, whereas 
Murra Foray would be limited 
to the energy in her nervous system. 

What he had now was hardly 
the same instrument. A Military 
version of it, perhaps. It didn't 
seem right to use the same name. 
Call it something staunch and 
crisp, suggestive of raw power. 
Manche. As good a name as any, 
Manche against Di manche. Cassal against a queen. 

He swung confidently along 
the walkway beside the transport 
tide. It was raining. He decided 
to test the new instrument. The 
Godolphian across the way bent 
double and wondered why his 
knees wouldn't work. They had 
suddenly become swollen and 
painful to move. Maybe it was 
the climate. 

And maybe it wasn't, thought 
Cassal. Eventually the pain 
would leave, but he hadn't meant 
to be so rough on the native. He'd 
have to watch how he used 
Manche. 

He scouted the vicinity of 
Travelers Aid Bureau, keeping at 
least one building between him 
and possible detection. Purely 
precautionary. There was no indication that Murra Foray had 
spotted him. For a Huntner, she 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



41 



wasn't very alert, apparently. 

He sent Manche out on exploration at minimum strength. The 
electronic guards which Dimanche had spoken of were still 
in place. Manche went through 
easily and didn't disturb an 
electron. Behind the guards there 
was no trace of the first counselor. 

He went closer. Still no warning of danger. The same old 
technician shuffled in front of 
the entrance. A horrible thought 
hit him. It was easy enough to 
verify. Another "reorganization" 
had taken place. The new sign 
read; 

STAB TRAVELERS AID BUREAU 

stab Your Hour 
of Need 

D^lly Mortinbras, first counselor 

Cassal leaned against the building, unable to understand what 
it was that frightened and bewildered him. Then it gradually 
became, if not clear, at least not 
quite so muddy. 

stab was the word that had 
been printed on the card in the 
money clip that his assailant in 
the alley had left behind. Cassal 
had naturally interpreted it as an 
order to the thug. It wasn't, of 
course. 

The first time Cassal had visited the Travelers Aid Bureau, it 
had been in the process of reorganization. The only purpose of 
the reorganization, he realized 



now, had been to change the 
name so he wouldn't translate the 
word on the slip into the original 
initials of the Bureau. 

Now it probably didn't matter 
any more whether or not he knew, 
so the name had been changed 
back to Star Travelers Aid Bureau — STAB. 

That, he saw bitterly, was why 
Murra Foray had been so positive that the identification tab 
he'd made with the aid of Dimanche had been a forgery. 

She had known the man who 
robbed Cassal of the original one, 
perhaps had even helped him 
plan the theft. 

THAT didn 't make sense to 
Cassal. Yet it had to. He'd 
suspected the organization of being a racket, but it obviously 
wasn't. By whatever name it was 
called, it actually was dedicated 
to helping the stranded traveler. 
The question was — which travelers? 

There must be agency operatives at the spaceport, checking 
every likely prospect who arrived, 
finding out where they were going, whether their papers were 
in order. Then, just as had happened to Cassal, the prospect was 
robbed Of his papers so somebody 
stranded here could go on to that 
destination ! 

The shabby, aging technician 
finished changing the last door

sign and hobbled over to Cassal. 
He peered through the rain and 
darkness. 

"You stuck here, tbo?" he 
quavered. 

"No," said Cassal with dignity, 
shaky dignity. "I'm not stuck. 
I'm here because I want to be." 

"You're crazy," declared the 
old man. "I remember — " 

Cassal didn't wait to find out 
what it was he remembered. An 
impossible land, perhaps, a planet which swings in perfect orbit 
around an ideal sun. A continent 
which reared a purple mountain 
range to hold up a honey sky. 
People with whom anyone could 
relax easily and without worry 
or anxiety. In short, his own native world from which, at night, 
all the constellations were familiar. 

Somehow, Cassal managed to 
get back to his suite, tumbled 
wearily onto his bed. The showdown wasn't going to take place. 

Everyone connected with the 
agency — including Murra Foray 
—had been "stuck here" for one 
reason or another: no identification tab, no money, whatever it 
was. That was the staff of the 
Bureau, a pack of desperate castaways. The "philanthropy" extended to them and nobody else. 
They grabbed their tabs and 
money from the likeliest travelers, 
leaving them marooned here — 
and they in turn had to join the 



Bureau and use the same methods 
to continue their journeys 
through the Galaxy. 

It was an endless belt of strand • 
ed travelers robbing and stranding other travelers, who then had 
to rob and strand still others, 
and so on and on . . . 

/VASSAL didn't have a chance 
^•of catching up with Mum 
Foray. She had used the time — 
and Dimanche — to create her 
own identification tab and escape. 
She was going back to Kettikat, 
home of the Huntners, must already be light-years away. 

Or was she? The signs on the 
Bureau had just been changed. 
Perhaps the ship was still in the 
spaceport, or cruising along below the speed of light. He shrugged defeatedly. It would do him 
no good; he could never get on 
board. 

He got up suddenly on one elbow. He couldn't, but Manche 
could! Unlike his old instrument, 
it could operate at tremendous 
distances, its power no longer dependent only on his limited nervous energy. 

With calculated fury, he let 
Manche strike out into space. 

"There you are !" exclaimed 
Murra Foray. "I thought you 
could do it." 

"Did you?" he asked coldly. 
"Where are you now?" 

"Leaving the atmosphere, if 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



43 



one may have claws." 

"Long claws? Long enough to 
reach from here to Kettikat?" 
She was laughing, but it sounded 
tli in and wistful. 

Manche struck out at Cassal's 
unspoken command. The laughter was canceled. 

"Now you've done it," said 




Dimanche investigated. "Of 
course not. A little tiling like that 
wouldn't hurt her. Her nerve system is marvelous. I think it could 
carry current for a city. Beautiful!" 

"I'm aware of the beauty," 
said Cassal. 




manche. "She's out cold." 

There was no reason for remorse: it was strange that he felt 
it. His throat was dry. 

"So you, too, can communicate 
with me. Through Manche, of 
course. I built a wonderful instrument, didn't I?" 

"A fearful one," said Dimanche 
•ternly. "She's unconscious." > 

"I heard you the first time." 
Cassal hesitated. "Is she dead?" 



A N awkward silence followed. 
Dimanche broke it. "Now 
that I know the facts, I'm proud 
to be her chosen instrument. Her 
need was greater than yours." 

Cassal growled. "As first counselor, she had access to every — " 

"Don't interrupt with your half 
truths," said Dimanche. "Huntners are special; their brain structure, too. Not necessarily better, 
just different. Only the auditory 



RELAY IN TRANSIT 



45 



and visual centers of their brains 
resemble that of man. You can 
guess the results of even superficial tampering with those parts 
of her mind. And stolen identification would involve lobotomy." 

He could imagine? Cassal 
shook his head. No, he couldn't. 
A blinded and deaf Murra Foray 
would not go back to the home of 
the Huntners. According to her 
racial conditioning, a sightless 
young tiger should creep away 
and die. 

Again there was silence. "No, 
she's not pretending unconsciousness," announced Dimanche. ''For 
a moment I thought — but never 
mind." 

The conversation was lasting 
longer than he expected. The ship 
must be obsolete and slow. There 
were still a few things he wanted 
to»find out, if there was time. 

"When are you going on 
Drive?" he asked. 

"We've been on it for some 
time," answered Dimanche. 

"Repeat that!" said Cassal, 
stunned. 

'T said that we've been on 
faster-than-light drive for some 
time. Is there anything wrong 
with that?" 

Nothing wrong with that at all. 
Theoretically, there was only one 
means of communicating with a 
ship hurtling along faster than 
light, and that way hadn't been 
invented. 



Hadn't been until he had put 
together the instrument he called 
Manche. 

Unwittingly, he had created far 
more than he intended. He ought 
to have felt elated. 

Dimanche interrupted his 
thoughts. "I suppose you .know 
what she thinks of you." 

"She made it plain enough." 
said Cassal wearily. "A teddy 
bear. A brainless, childish toy." 

"Among the Huntners, women 
are vigorous and aggressive," said 
Dimanche. The voice grew weaker as the ship, already light-years 
away, slid into unfathomable distances. "Where words are concerned, morals are very strict. For 
instance, 'dear' is never used 
unless the person means it. Huntner men are weak and not overburdened with intelligence." 

The voice was barely audible, 
but it continued: "The principal 
romantic figure in the dreams of 
women . . ." Dimanche failed altogether. 

"Manche!" cried Cassal. 

Manche responded with everything it had. ". . . is the teddy 
bear." 

The elation that had been missing, and the triumph, came now. 
It was no time for hesitation, and 
Cassal didn't hesitate. Their actions had been directed against 
each other, but their emotions, 
which each had tried to ignore, 
were real and strong. 



GALAXY SCIENCI FICTION 



The gravitor dropped him to 
the ground floor. In a few minutes, Cassal was at the Travelers 
Aid Bureau. 

Correction. Now it was Star 
Travelers Aid Bureau. 

And, though no one but himself 
knew it, even that was wrong. 
Quickly he found the old technician. 

"There's been a reorganlzation," said Casual bluntly. "I 
want the signs changed." 

The old man drew himself up. 
"Who are you?" 

"I've just elected myself," said 
Cassal. "I'm the new first counselor." 

He hoped no one would be 
foolish enough to challenge him. 
He wanted an organization that 
could function immediately, not 
a hospital full of cripples. 

The old man thought about it. 
He was merely a menial, but he 
had been with the bureau for a 
long time. He was nobody, nothing, but he could recognize power 
when it was near him. He wiped 
his eyes and shambled out into 
the fine cold rain. Swiftly the 
new signs went up. 

STAR TRAVELERS AID HI RE Kt' 

8. t. a. with us 
Denton Cassal, first counselor 

^~*ASSAL sat at the control cen^--'ter. Every question cubicle 
was visible at a glance. In addi


tion there was a special panel, 
direct from the spaceport, which 
recorded essential data about 
every newly arrived traveler. He 
could think of a few minor improvements, but he wouldn't have 
time to put them into effect. He'd 
mention them to his assistant, a 
man with a fine, logical mind. 
Not: really first-rate, of course, 
but well suited to his secondary 
position. Every member quickly 
rose or sank to, his proper level 
in this organization, and this one 
had, without a struggle. 

Business was dull. The lust 
few ships had brought travelers 
who were bound for unimaginably dreary destinations, nothing 
he need be concerned with. 

He thought about the instrument. It was the addition of power that made the difference. 
Dimanche plus power equaled 
Manche. and Manche raised the 
user far above the level of other 
men. There was little to fear. 

But essentially the real value 
of Manche lay in this — it was a 
beginning. Through it, he had 
communicated with a ship traveling far faster than light. The only 
one instrument capable of that 
was instantaneous radio. Actually it wasn't radio, but the old 
name had stuck to it. 

Manche was really a very 
primitive model of instantaneous 
radio. It was crude: all first steps 
were. Limited in range, it was 



DELAY IN TRANSIT 



practically valueless for that purpose now. Eventually the range 
would be extended. Hitch a neuronic manufactured brain to human one, add the power of a tiny 
atomic battery, and Manche was 
created. 

The last step was his share of 
the invention. Or maybe the credit belonged to Murra Foray. If 
she hadn't stolen Dimanche, it 
never would have been necessary 
to put together the new instrument. » 

The stem lines on his face relaxed. Murra Foray. He wondered about the marriage customs of 
the Huntners. He hoped marriage 
Iras a custom on Kettikat. 

Cassal leaned back; officially, 
his mission was complete. There 
was fio longer any need to go to 
Tunney 21. The scientist he was 
sent to bring back might as well 
remain there in obscure arrogance. Cassal knew he should return to Earth immediately. But 
the Galaxy was wide and there 
w?re lots of places to go. 

Only one he was interested in, 
though— Kettikat, as far from the 
center of the Galaxy as Earth, 
but in the opposite direction, incredibly far away in terms of 
trouble and transportation. It 
would be difficult even for a man 
who had the services of Manche. 

Cassal glanced at the board. 
Someone wanted to go to Zombo. 

"Delly," he called to his assist


ant. "Try 13. This may be what 
you want to get back to your own 
planet." 

Delly Mortinbras nodded gratefully and cut in. 

Cassal continued scanning. 
There was more to it than he 
imagined, though he was learning fast. It wasn't enough to have 
identification, money, and a destination. The right ship might 
come in with standing room only. 
Someone had to be "persuaded" 
that Godolph was a cozy little 
place, as good as any for an unscheduled stopover. 

It wouldn't change appreciably 
during his lifet'ime. There were 
too many billions of stars. First 
he had to perfect it, isolate from 
dependence on the human element, and then there would come 
the installation. A slow process, 
even with Murra to help him. 

Someday he would go back to 
Earth. He should be welcome. 
The information he was sending 
back to his former employers, 
Neuronics, Inc., would more than 
compensate them for the loss of 
Dimanche. 

Suddenly he was alert. A report had just come in. 

Once upon a time, he thought 
tenderly, scanning the report, 
there was a teddy bear that could 
reach to Kettikat. With claws — 
but he didn't think they would 
be needed.
