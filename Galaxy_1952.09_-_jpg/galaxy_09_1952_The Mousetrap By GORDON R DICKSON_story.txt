The Mousetrap By GORDON R. DICKSON 


THERE was nothing to do. 
There was no place to go. 
He swam up to consciousness on the sleepy languor 
of that thought. Nothing to do, 
no place to go f tomorrow is forever. Could sleep, but body wants 



to wake up. His body was a cork 
floating up from deep water, up, 
up to the surface. 

He opened his eyes. Sunlight 
and blue sky; sky so blue that if 
you looked at it long enough you 
could begin to imagine yourself 

falling into it. No clouds; just 
blue, blue sky. 

Me felt as if he had slept the 
clock of eternity around and back 
again until the hands of time were 
in the same position they had 
held when he went to sleep. When 
had that been? It was a long time 
ago, top far back to remember. 
He stopped worrying about it. 

He lay supine, his arms flung 
wide, his legs asprawl. He became 
conscious of short blades of grass 
tickling the backs of his hands. 
There was a tiny breeze from 
somewhere that now and again 
brushed his face with its cool 
wing. And an edge of white cloud 
was creeping into the patch of 
blue that gradually rilled his field 
of vision. 

Slowly, physical awareness 
crept back to him. He felt 
smSbth , loose clothing lying 
lightly against his skin, the expansion and contraction of his 
chest, the hard ground pressure 
against the long length of his 
back. And suddenly he was complete. The thousand disconnected 
sensations flowed together and 
became one. He was aware of 
himself as a single united entity, 
alive and alone, lying stretched 
out, exposed and vulnerable in 
an unknown place. 

Brain pulsed, nerves tensed, 
muscles leaped. 

He sat up. 

"Where am I?" 



ITE sat on a carpet of green 
" ■■- turf that dipped gradually 
away ahead and on either side of 
him to a ridiculously close horizon. He twisted his head and 
looked over his shoulder. Behind 
him was a gravel walk leading to 
a small building that looked very 
airy and light. The front, beneath a thick ivory roof that 
soared flat out, apparently unsupported for several yards beyond the front itself, was one 
large window. He could see, like 
looking into the cool dimness of 
a cave, big, comfortable chairs, 
low tables, and what might possibly be a viseo. 

Hesitantly, he rose to his feet 
and approached the building. 

At the entrance he paused. 
There was no door, only a variable force-curtain to keep the 
breezes out; and he pushed his 
hand through it carefully, as if to 
test the atmosphere inside. But 
there was only the elastic stretch 
and sudden yield that was like 
pushing your fist through the wall 
of a huge soap bubble, and then 
a pleasant coolness beyond, so he 
withdrew his hand and, somewhat 
timidly, entered. 

The room illuminated itself. He 
looked around. The chairs, the 
tables, everything was just as he 
had seen it from outside, through 
the window. And the thing that 
looked like a viseo was a viseo. 

He walked over to it and ex

amtncd it curiously. It was one of 
the large models, receiver and 
record-player, with its own 
built-in library of tapes. He left 
it and went on through an interior 
doorway into the back of the 
house. 

Here were two more rooms, a 
bedroom and a kitchen. The bed 
was another force-field — expensivr and luxurious. The kitchen 
had a table and storage lockers 
through whose transparent windows he could see enough eatables and drinkables stored there 
to last one man a hundred years. 

At the thought of one* man living in this lap of luxury for a 
hundred years, the earlier realization that he was alone came back 
to him. This was not his place. 
It did not belong to him. The 
owner could not be far off. 

He went hurriedly back through 
the living room and out into the 
sunlight. The green turf stretched 
away on every side of him, 
empty, unrelieved by any other 
living figure. 

"Hello!" he called. 

His voice went out and died, 
without echoes, without answer. 
He called again, his voice going 
ft trifle shrill. 

"Hello? Anybody here? Hellof 
Hello.'" 

There was no answer. He 
looked down the gravel path to 
his right, to the short horizon. He 
looked down the path to his left 



and his breath caught in his 
throat. 

He began to run in a senseless, 
brain -numbing, chest -constricting 
panic. 

*|iHE grass streamed silently by 
on both sides of him, and his 
feet pounded on the gravel of 
the path. He ran until his lungs 
heaved with exhaustion and the 
pounding of his heart seemed to 
shake his thin body, when at last 
fatigue forced him to a halt. He 
stood and looked around him. 

The building was out of sight 
now, and he found himself on the 
edge of a forest of tall flowers. 
Ten feet high or more, they lay 
like a- belt across his way, and 
the path led through them. Greenstemmed, with long oval leaves 
gracefully reaching out, with flat, 
broad-petaled blue blossoms 
spread to the bright sky, they 
looked like the graceful creations 
of a lost dream. There was no 
odor, but his head seemed to 
whirl when he looked at them, 

Somehow they frightened him; 
their height and their multitude 
seemed to look down on him as 
an intruder. He hesitated at that 
point where the path began to 
wind among them, no longer 
straight and direct as it had been 
through the grass. He felt irrational fear at the thought of 
pushing by them — but the loneliness behind him was worse. 



THE MOUSETRAP

He went on. 

Once among the flowers, he lost 
all sense of time and distance. 
There was nothing but the gravel 
beneath his feet, a patch of blue 
sky overhead and the flowers, 
only the flowers. For a while he 
walked; and then, panic taking 
him again at the apparent endlessness of the green stems, he 
burst into a fear-stricken run 
which ended only when exhaustion once more forced him to a 
walk. After that, he plodded 
hopelessly, his desire to escape 
fighting a dull battle with increasing weariness. 

TfTE came out of it suddenly. 

One moment the flowers were 
all around him; then the path 
took an abrupt twist to the right 
and he was standing on the edge 
of % new patch of turf through 
which the path ran straight as 
ever. 

He stopped, half disbelieving 
what he saw. With a little inarticulate grunt of relief, he stepped 
free of the flower-shadowed pathway and went forward between 
new fields of grass. 

He did not have much farther 
to go. In a few minutes he topped 
• small rise and his walk came to 
an end. 

There, in front of him, was the 
building. 

The very same building he had 
run away from earlier. 



TIE approached it slowly, trying to cling to the hope that 
it was not the same building, that 
he had somehow gone somewhere 
else, rather than that he had 
traveled in a circle. But the identity was too complete. There was 
the large window, the chairs, the , 
viseo. There was the door to 
the bedroom and the one to the 
kitchen. 

Moving like a man in a dream, 
he walked forward and into the 
house. 

He knew where he was going 
now. He remembered what he 
had seen before — a bottle of light, 
amber-colored liquid among the 
stores in the kitchen. He found it 
among a thickly crowded bank 
of others of its kind and took off 
the cap humbly. He put the bottle 
to his lips. 

The liquor burned his throat. 
Tears sprang to his eyes at the 
fire of it and he was glad, for the 
sensation gave him a feeling of 
reality that he had not yet had 
among the dreamlike emptiness 
of his surroundings. 

Taking the bottle, he went outside to the grass in front of the 
building. 

"This is good," he thought, 
taking another drink, and sitting 
down on the grass. "This is here 
and now, a departure point from 
which to figure out the situation. 
/ drink, therefore I am. The beginning of a philosophy."

He drank again. 

"But where do I go from 
there? Where is this? Who am I?" 

He frowned suddenly. Well, 
Who was he? The question went 
groping back and lost itself in a 
maze of shadows where his memory should have been. Almost, 
but not quite, he knew. He shook 
his head impatiently. 

"Never mind that now. Plenty 
of time to figure that out later. 
The thing is to discover where 
I am, first." 

Where was he, then? The drink 
was beginning to push soft fingers of numbness into his mind. 
The grass was Earth grass and 
the building was a human-type 
structure. But the flowers weren't 
like anything, on Earth. Were 
they like anything on any other 
planet he'd ever been on? 

He wrinkled his forehead in a 
frown, trying to remember. If 
only he could recall where he had 
been before he woke Tip! He 
thought he had been on Earth, 
but he wasn't sure. The things 
he wanted to remember seemed 
to skitter away from his recollection just before he touched them. 

He lay back on the grass. 

Where was he? He was in a 
place where one walked in circles. 
He was in a place where things 
were too perfect to be natural. 
The grass looked like a lawn and 
there were acres of it. There were 
acres of flowers, too. But the 



grass was real grass; and from 
what he'd seen of the flowers, 
they were real and natural as 
well. 

Yet there was something wrong. 
He felt it. There was a strange 
air of artificiality about it all. 

He lay back on the grass, staring at the sky and taking occasional drinks from the bottle. 
Without realizing it, he was getting very drunk. 

His mind cast about like the 
nose of a hunting dog. Something 
about the place in which he 
found himself was wrong, but 
the something continued to elude 
him. Maybe it had to do with the 
fact that he couldn't seem to re•lember things. Whatever it was, 
it was something that told him 
clearly and unarguably that he 
wasn't on Earth or any of the 
planets he'd ever known or heard 
of. 

He looked to the right and he 
looked to the left. He looked 
down and he looked up, and realization came smashing through 
the drunken fog in his mind. 

There was no Sun in the sky. 

He rose to his feet, the bottle 
in his hand, for a horrible suspicion was forming in his mind. 
He turned away from the house, 
looked at the chronometer on his 
wrist and began to walk. 

When he got back to the house, 
the bottle in his hand was empty. 
But all the alcohol inside him 



THE MOUSETRAP 



12! 



could not shut out the truth from 
his mind. He was alone, on a tiny 
world that was half green grass 
and half great blue flowers. A 
pretty world, a silent, dreaming 
world beneath a bright, eternal 
shy. An empty world, and he 
was on it — 
Alone. 

HE went away from the world, 
as far as drink would take 
him. And for many days — or was 
jt weeks? — reality became a hazy 
thing, until the poor, starved 
body could take no more and so 
collapsed. Then there was no remembrance, but when he came 
back to himself at last, he found 
to little miracle had happened, 
during that blank period. 

Memory of a part of his life 
had come back to him. 

BORN and raised on Earth, 
in Greater Los Angeles, he 
had been pitched neck and crop 
off his native planet at the age 
of twenty-one, along with some 
tit In r twenty million youngsters 
for which overcrowded Earth had 
no room. Overpopulation was a 
problem. Those without jobs were 
deported when they reached the 
of maturity. And what chance 
had a poor young man to get an 
Earthside job when rich colonials 
wanted them? For Earth was the 
tenter of government and trade. 
He was spared the indignity of 



d< iKittation. His family scraped 
up the money for passage to Rigel 
IV and arranged a job in a typographers' office for h i m there. 
They would continue to pull 
strings, they said, and he was to 
work hard and save as much as 
he could in the hope of being 
able eventually to buy his way 
back — although this was a forlorn hope; the necessary bribes 
for citizenship would run to several million credits. They saw 
him off with a minimum of tears; 
Father. Mother, and a younger 
sister, who herself would be leaving in a couple of years. 

He went on to Rigel IV, filled 
with the determination of youth 
to conquer all obstacles: to make 
his fortune in the approved fashion and return, trailing clouds of 
glory, to his astounded and delighted parents. 

But Rigel IV proved strangely 
indifferent to his enthusiasm. The 
earlier colonists had seen his kind 
before. They resented his Earthpride, they laughed at his 
squeamishness where the local 
aliens were concerned, and they 
played upon his exaggerated fears 
of the Devils, as the yet-unknown 
alien races beyond the spatial 
frontier were called. They had 
only contempt for his job in the 
typographers' office and no one 
liked him well enough to offer 
him any other occupation. 

So he sat at his desk, turning 



122 



GALAXY SCIINCE FICTION 



out an occasional map copy on 
his desk duplicator for the stray 
customers that wandered in. He 
stared out the window at the red 
dust in the streets and in the air, 
calculating over and over again 
how many hundreds of years of 
hoarding his salary would be required to save up the bribe money 
for citizenship, and dreaming of 
the lost beauty of the cool white 
moonlight of Earth. 

ABOVE all else, he remembered 
and yearned for moonlight. 
It became to him the symbol of 
all that he wished for and could 
not have. And he began to seek it 
—more and more often— in the 
contents of a bottle. 

And so the breakup came. 
Though there was little to do at 
his job, a time came when he 
could not even do that, but 
sprawled on his bed in the hotel, 
dreaming of moonlight, while the 
days merged one into the other 
endlessly. 

Termination came in the form 
of a note from his office and two 
months' salary. 

Further than that, his recovered memory would not go. He 
lay for the equivalent of some 
days, recuperating; and when he 
was able to move around again, 
he discovered to his relief that 
he was now able to leave the remaining bottles in the liquor section alone. 



SHORTLY after, he discovered 
that the house walls were honeycombed with equipment and 
control panels, behind sliding 
doors. He gazed at these with 
wonder, but for some reason 
could not bring himself to touch 
them. 

One in particular drew him and 
repelled him even more than the 
'rest. It was by far the simplest 
of the lot, having only four plain 
switches on it. The largest one, 
a knife switch with a red handle, 
exerted the strongest influence 
over him. The urge to pull it was 
so strong that he could not bear 
to stand staring at it for more 
than a few minutes, without 
reaching out his hand toward it. 
But no sooner did his fingertips 
approach the red handle than a 
reaction set in. A paralysis rooted 
him to the spot, his heart pounded 
violently, and sweat oozed coldly 
from his pores. He would be 
forced then to close the panel and 
not go back to it for several hours. 
Finally, he compromised with 
his compulsion. There were three 
smaller switches : and finally, 
gingerly, he reached out his hand 
to the first of these, one time 
when he had been staring at it, 
and pulled it. 

The light went out. 

He screamed in blind animal 
fear and slapped wildly at the 
panel. The switch moved again 
beneath his hand and the light 



THE MOUSETRAP 



came back on. Sobbing, he leaned 
against the panel, gazing in overwhelming relief out through the 
big front window at the good 
green grass and the brightness of 
the sky beyond. 

It was some time before he 
could bring himself to touch that 
switch again. Finally he summoned up the nerve to pull it 
once more and stood a long while 
in the darkness, with thudding 
heart, letting his eyes grow accustomed to it. 

Eventually he found he could 
see again, but faintly. He groped 
his way through the gloom of the 
front room and lifted his face to 
the sky outside, from which the 
faint glow came. 

And this time he did not cry 
out. 

The night sky was all around 
him and filled with stars. It .was 
the* bright shine of them that illuminated his little world with a 
sort of ghostly brilliance. Stars, 
stars, in every quarter of the 
heavens, stars. But it was not 
just their presence alone that 
struck him rigid with horror. 

Like all of his generation, he 
knew how the stars looked from 
every planet owned by man. 
What schoolchild did not? He 
could glance at the stars from 
a position in any quarter of the 
human sector of space and tell 
roughly from the arrangement 
, overhead where that position was. 



Consequently, his sight of the 
stars told him where he was now; 
and it was this knowledge that 
gripped him with mind-freezing 
terror. 

He was adrift, alone on a little, 
self-contained world, ten miles in 
diameter, a pitiful little bubble 
of matter, in the territory of the 
Devils, in the unknown regions 
beyond the farthest frontier. 

He could not remember what 
happened immediately after that. 
Somehow, he must have gotten 
back inside and closed the light 
switch, for when he woke again 
to sanity, the light had hidden 
the stars once more. But fear had 
come to live with him. He knew 
now that malice or chance had 
cut him irrevocably off from his 
own kind and thrust him forth 
to be the prey or sport of whatever beings held this unknown 
space. 

But from that moment, memory of his adult life began to return. Bit by bit, from the further 
past, and working closer in time, 
it came. And at first he welcomed 
almost sardonically the life-story 
it told. Now that he knew where 
he was, whatever his history 
turned oat to be, it could make 
no difference. 

As time went on, though, interest in the man he had been obsessed him, and he seized on 
each individual recollection as it 
emerged from the mist, grasping 



124 




 



et it almost frantically. The viseo 
that he kept running, purely for 
the sake of human-seeming companionship, played unheeded 
while he hunted desperately 
through the hazy corridor of his 
mind. 




E remembered his name now. 
• It was Helmut Perran. 



Helmut Perran had gone from 
despondency to hopelessness after 
his dismissal from the job at the 
typographers. He was a confirmed 
alcoholic now, and with the labor 
shortage common on an expanding planet, he had no trouble 
finding enough occasional work 
to keep himself in liquor. He 
nearly succeeded in killing himself off, but his youth and health 
saved him. 

They dragged him back to existence in the' snake ward of the 
local hospital, and psychoed a 
temporary cure on him. Helmut 
had gone downhill socially until 
he reached rock bottom, until 
there was no further for him to 
go. He began to come back up 
again, but by a different route. 

He came up in the shadowy 
no-man's-land just across the 
border of the law. He was passer, 
pimp and come-on man. He 
fronted for a gambling outfit. He 
made some money and went into 
business for himself as a promoter of crooked money-making 
schemes, and he ended as advance 



agent for a professional srr^**gling outfit. 

Oddly enough, the business was 
only technically illegal. With the 
mushroom growth of the worlds, 
dirty politics and graft had mushroomed as well. Tariffs were 
passed often for the sole purpose 
of putting money in the pockets 
of customs officials. Unnecessary 
red tape served the same purpose. 
The upshot was that graft became an integral part of interstellar business. The big firms 
had their own agents to cut 
through these difficulties with the 
golden knife of credits. The 
smaller firms, or those who could 
less afford the direct graft, did 
business with smuggling outfits. 

These did not actually smuggle; they merely saw to it that 
the proper men and machines 
were blind when a shipment that 
had been arranged for came 
through regular channels. They 
dealt with the little men — the 
spaceport guard, the berthing 
agent, the customs agent who 
checked the invoice — where the 
big firms made direct deals with 
the customs house head, or the 
political appointee in charge of 
that governmental section. It was 
more risky than the way of the 
big firms, but also much less expensive. 

Helmut Perran, as advance 
agent, made the initial contact". 
It was his job to determine who 



THE MOUSETRAP 



were the men who would have to 
be fixed, to take the risk of approaching them cold, and either 
to bribe them into cooperation or 
make sure that another man who 
could be bribed took their place 
at the proper time. 

It was a job that paid well. 
But by this time, Helmut was 
ambitious. He was sick of ille• gality and he thought he saw a 
way back to Earth and the moonlight. He shot for a job as fixer 
with one of the big firms that 
dealt directly with the head men 
in Customs — and got it. 

It was as simple as that, He 
was now respectable, wealthy, 
and his chance would come. 

He worked for the big firm 
faithfully for five years before it 
did. Then there came along a 
transfer of goods so large and 
involved that he was authorized 
to arrange for bribes of more 
than three million credits. He 
made the arrangement, took the 
credits, and -skipped to Earth, 
where, With more than enough 
money to cover it, he at last 
bought his coveted Earth citzenship. 

After that, they came and got 
him, as he knew they would. 
They got him a penal sentence 
of ten years, but they couldn't 
manage revocation of the citzenship. Through the hell of the 
little question room and the long 
trial', he carried a ; miniature pic


ture in his mind of the broad 
white streets of Los Angeles in 
the moonlight and the years 
ahead. 

¥>UT there the memory ended* 
He had a vague recollection 
of days in some penal institution, 
and then the mists were thick 
again. He beat hard knuckles 
against his head in a furious rage 
to remember. 

What had happened? 

They couldn't have touched 
him while he was serving his sentence. And once he had put in 
his ten years, he would be a free 
man with the full rights of hia 
Earth citizenship. Then let them 
try anything. They were a firm 
of colossal power, but Earth was 
filled with such colossi; and the 
Earth laws bore impartially on 
all. What, then, had gone wrong? 

He groaned, rocking himself in 
his chair like a child, in his misery. But he was close to the 
answer, so close. Give him just 
a bit more time — ■ 

But he was not allowed the 
time. Before he could bring the 
answer to the front of his mind, 
the Devils came. 

Their coming was heralded by 
the high-pitched screaming of a 
siren, which cut off abruptly as 
the spaceship came through the 
bright opaqueness of the sky, like 
the Sun through a cloud, and 
dropped gently toward the 




 



ground, its bright metal sides 
gleaming as if they had been 
freshly buffed. It landed not fifty 
feet from him. The weight of it 
sank its rounded bottom deep beneath the surface of the sod, so 
that it looked like a huge metal 
bowl turned face-down on the 
grass. 

A port opened in its side and 
two bipedal, upright creatures 
stepped out of it and came toward him. 

As they approached bim, time 
seemed to slip a cog and move 
very slowly. He had a chance to 
notice small individual differences between them. They were 
both shorter than he by at least 
s head, although the one on 
rout's left was slightly taller. 
They were covered with what 
seemed to be white fur, all but 
two little black buttons of eyes 
apiece. And they seemed to have 
more than the ordinary number 
of joints in their legs and arms, 
for these limbs bent like rubber 
hose when they walked or gesticulated. They were carrying a 
square box between them. 

Helmut stood still, waiting for 
them. The only thought in his 
mind was that now he would 
never get to know how he had 
happened to be here, and he was 
sorry, for he had grown fond of 
the man he had once been, not 
the one he later turned out to be, 
as you might be fond of a dis


tant relative. Meanwhile, he could 
feel his breath coming with great 
difficulty and his heart thumping 
inside him as it had thumped 
that time he had first tried the 
switch that turned off the light. 

He watched them come up to a 
few feet fjom him and set the 
box down. 

As soon as it was resting on the 
grass, it began to vibrate and a 
hum came from it that was 
pitched at about middle C. It 
went up in volume until it was 
about as loud as a man saying 
"aaaah" when a doctor holds 
down his tongue with a depresser 
to look at his throat. When it 
had reached this point, it broke 
suddenly from a steady sound 
into a series of short, intermittent 
hums that gradually resolved 
themselves into syllables. He realized that the box was talking 
to him, one syllable at a time. 

"Do not be afraid," it said. 
"We wi sh to tal k to you." 

Helmut said nothing. He 
wanted to hear what the box had 
to say, but, at the same time, a 
compulsion was mounting within 
him. It screamed that these others were horrible and unnatural 
and dangerous, that nothing they 
said was true, that he must turn 
and run to safety before it was 
too late. 

They had been watching him 
for a long time, the box went on 
to 'tell him. They had listened 



THE MOUSETRAP 



from a safe distance to the viseo 
tapes he had run on the machine 
and finally translated his language. They had done their best 
to understand him from a distance and had failed, for he 
seemed to be unhappy and to 
dislike being where he was and 
what he was doing, ^nd if this 
was so, why was he doing it? 
They did not understand. Where 
had he come from and who was 
he? Why was he here? , 

Helmut looked at the four little 
black eyes that gazed at him 
like the puzzled, half -friendly 
eyes of a bear he had seen in 
a zoo while he was a boy back 
on Earth. There was no possible 
way for wh ite -furred faces to 
have shown expression, but he 
thought he read kindness in them, 
and (be long loneliness of his stay 
on ftje sphere rose up and almost 
choked him with a desire to answer them. But that savagely irrational corner of his mind 
surged forward to combat the impulse toward friendliness. 

He opened his mouth. Only a 
garbled croak came out. 

He turned and ran. 

He raced to the building and 
burst through the entrance. He 
threw himself at the panel that 
hid the switches, pulling it open 
and sliding aside the door that 
covered them. He reached for the 
red -handled switch, hesitated, 
and looked over his shoulder at 



the two creatures. They stood as 
he had left them. For the last 
time, he wavered under the urge 
to go back to them, to tell them 
his story, at least to listen to their 
side once — first. 

But they were Devils! 

The fear and anger inside him 
surged up, beating down everything else. He grasped the red 
switch firmly and threw it home. 

What followed after that was 
nightmare. 

TTE had been sitting for a long 
time in the cold hall and nobody had paid any attention to 
him. Occasionally, men in Space 
Guard uniforms or the white 
coats of laboratory workers would 
go past him into the Warden's 
office, and come out again a little 
later. But all of these went past 
him as if he did not exist. 

He shifted uncomfortably in 
the chair they had given him. 
They had outfitted him in fresh 
civilian clothes, which felt clinging and uncomfortable after the 
long months of running around 
on the sphere half-naked. The 
clothes, like the stiff waitingroom chair, the hall, and the parade of passing men all chafed 
on him and shrieked at him that 
he did not belong. He hated them. 

The parade in and out of the 
office went on. 

Finally, the door to the office 
opened and a young Guardsman

stuck his head out. 

"You can come in now," he 
said. 

Helmut got to his feet. He did 
it awkwardly, the unaccustomed 
clothing seeming to stick to him, 
his legs half- asleep from the long 
wait in the chair. 

He walked through the door 
and the young Guard shut it behind him. The Warden, a spare 
man of Helmut's age, with a military stiffness in his bearing and 
noncommittal mouth and eyes, 
looked up from his desk. 

"You can go, Price," he said 
to the Guard; and, to Helmut, 
"Sit down, Perran." 

Helmut lowered himself clumsily into the armchair across 
the desk from the Warden as the 
young Guardsman went out the 
door. The Warden stared at him 
for a moment. 

"Well, Perran," he said, "you 
deserve to congratulate yourself. 
You're one of our lucky ones/' 

Helmut stared back at him, 
numbly, for a long time. Then, 
abruptly, it was like being sick. 
Without warning, a sob came 
choking up in his throat and he 
laid his head on the desk in front 
of him and began to cry. 

The Warden lit a cigarette and 
smoked it for a while, staring out 
the window. The sound of Helmut's sobs was strained in the 
silence of the office. When they 
had dwindled somewhat, the 



Warden spoke again to Helmut. 

"You'll get over it," he said. 
"That* s just the conditioning 
wearing off. If you didn't break 
down and cry, you'd have been, 
in serious psychological trouble. 
You'll be all right now." 

Helmut lifted his head from the 
desk. 

"What happened to me?" he 
asked, his throat hoarse. "Wb^t 
happened?" 

The Warden puffed on his cigarette. "You were assigned to one 
of our Mousetraps," he answered. 
"It's a particularly hazardous 
duty for which criminals can 
volunteer. Normally, we only get 
men under death sentence or 
those with life terms. You're an 
exception." 

"But I didn't volunteer!" 

"In your case," said the Warden, "there may have been some 
dirty work along the line. We 
are investigating. Of course, if 
that turns out to be the case, 
you'll be entitled to reparation. 
I don't suppose you remember 
how you came to be on the 
Mousetrap, do you?" 

TTELMUT shook his head, 
•i-i- "It's not surprising," said 
the Warden. "Few do, although, 
theoretically, the conditioning is 
supposed to disappear after you 
capture a specimen. Briefly, you 
were given psychological treatment in order to fit you for ex

istence alone in the Mousetrap. 
It's necessary, because usually 
our Baits live their life out on 
the sphere without attracting any 
alien life. You were one of the 
lucky ones, Perran." 

"But what is it?" asked Helmut. "What is it for?" 

"The Mousetrap system?" the 
Warden answered. "It's our first 
step in the investigation of alien 
races with a view to integrating 
them into human economy. We 
take a sphere like the one you 
were on, put a conditioned criminal on it, and shove it off into 
unexplored territory where we 
have reason to suspect the presence of new races. With luck, the 
alien investigates the sphere and 
our conditioned Bait snaps the 
trap shut on him. Lacking luck, 
the Mousetrap is either not investigated or the aliens aren't 
properly trapped. Our conditioned man, in that case, blows it 
up — and himself along with it. 

"As I say, you were lucky. 
You're back here safe on Kronbar, and we've got a fine couple 
of hitherto undiscovered specimens for our laboratory to investigate. What if those creatures 
had beaten you to the switch?" 

Helmut shuddered and covered 
his eyes, as if, by doing so, he 
could shut the memory from his 
mind. . 1 

"The Guard Ship was so long 
coming," he muttered. "So long! 



Days. And I had to watch them 
all that time caught in a forcefield like flies in a spider web. 
I couldn't go away without stepping out of the building and being caught myself. And they kept 
talking to me with that little box 
of theirs. They couldn't understand why I did it. They kept 
asking me over and over again 
why I did it. But they got weaker 
and weaker and finally they died. 
Then they just hung there because the force-field wouldn't let 
them fall over." 

His voice dwindled away. 

The Warden cleared his throat 
with a short rasp. "A trying time, 
I'm sure," he said. "But you have 
the consolation of knowing that 
you have performed a very useful 
duty for the human race." He 
stood up. "And now, Unless you 
have some more questions—" 

"When can I go home?" asked 
Helmut. "Back to Earth." 

The Warden looked a trifle embarrassed. "Your capture of the 
aliens entitles you to a pardon; 
and of course you have Earth 
Citizenship — but I'm afraid we 
won't be able to let you leave 
Kronbar." 

Helmut stared at him from a 
face that seemed to have gone 
entirely wooden. Hip lips moved 
stiffly. 

"Why not?" he croaked. 

"Well, you see," said the Warden, leading the way to a dif

ferent door than the one through 
which Helmut had entered, "these 
specimens you brought back seem 
to be harmless, and inside of a 
month or two we'll probably have 
a task force out there to put them 
completely under our thumb. But 
we've had a little trouble before, 
when we'd release a Bait and 
it would turn out later that the 
aliens had in some way infected 
him. So there happens to be a 
blanket rule that successful Baits 
have to live out the rest of their 
life on Kronbar," He opened the 
door invitingly. "You can go out 
this way, if you want. Private entrance. It leads directly to the 
street." 

SLOWLY, Helmut rose to his 
feet and shambled over to the 
door. For one last time a vision 
of moonlight on the bay at Santa 
Monica mocked him. A wild 
scheme flashed through his head 
in which he overpowered the 



Warden, stole his uniform and 
bluffed his way to a Guard Patjol ship, where he forced the 
crew to take him either to Earth, 
or, failing that, out beyond the 
Frontier to warn the white-furred 
kin of the two alien beings he 
had killed. 

Then the scheme faded from 
his mind. It was no use. The 
odds were too great. There were 
too many like the Warden. There 
were always too many of them 
for Helmut and those like him. 
He turned away from the Warden, ignoring the Warden's outstretched hand. 

He went out the door and down 
the steps into the brilliant daylight of Kronbar. 

Kronbar, the Bright Planet, socalled because, since it winds an 
eccentric orbit around the twin 
stars of a binary system, there is 
neither dark nor moonlight, and 
the Sun is always shining.
