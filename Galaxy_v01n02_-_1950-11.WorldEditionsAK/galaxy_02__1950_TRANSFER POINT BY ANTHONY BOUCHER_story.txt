TRANSFER POINT BY ANTHONY BOUCHER 

It was a nasty plot Vyrko was 
that he constructed it himself 

THERE were three of them in 
the retreat, three out of all 
mankind safe from the deadly yellow bands. .' 

The great Kirth-Labbery himself 
had constructed the retreat and its 
extraordinary air-conditioning — n o t 
because his scientific genius had foreseen the coming of the poisonous 
element, agnoton, and the end of the 
human race, but because he itched. 

And here Vyrko sat, methodically 
recording the destruction of mankind, once in a straight factual record, for the instruction of future 
readers ("if any," he added wryly to 
himself), and again as a canto in 
that epic poem of Man which he 
never expected to complete, but for 
which he lived. 

Lavra's long golden hair fell over 
his shoulders. It was odd that its 
scent distracted him when -he was at 
work on the factual record, yet 
seemed to wing the lines of the epic. 

"But why bother?" she asked. Her 
speech might have been clearer if her 
tongue had not been more preoccupied with the savor of the apple than 
with the articulation of words. But 



involved in. The worst part was 
and didn't get the end right! 

Vyrko understood readily: the remark was as familiar an opening as 
P-K4 in chess. 

"It's my duty," Vyrko explained 
patiently. "I haven't your father's scientific knowledge and -perception. 
Your father's? I haven't the knowledge of his humblest lab assistant. 
But I can put words together so that 
they make sense and sometimes more 
than sense, and I have to do this." 

From Lavra's plump red lips an 
apple pip fell into the works of the 
electronic typewriter. Vyrko fished it 
out automatically; this too was part of 
the gambit, with the possible variants 
of grape seed, orange peel. . . . 

"But why," Lavra demanded petulantly, "won't Father let us leave 
here? A girl might as well be in 
a ... a ..." 
"Convent?" Vyrko suggested. He 
was a good amateur paleolinguist. 
"There is an analogy — even despite 
my presence. Convents were supposed to shelter girls from the Perils 
of The World. Now the whole world 
is one great Peril . . . outside of this 
retreat." 

"Go on," Lavra urged. She had

long ago - learned, Vyrko suspected,' 
that he was a faintly over- serious 
young man with no small talk, and 
that she could enjoy his full attention only by asking to have something explained, even if for the »th 
time. 




E SMILED and thought of the 
. girls he used to talk with, not 



at, and. of how little breath they had 
fttr talking now in the world where 
no one drew an unobstructed breath. 

It had begun with the accidental 
discovery in a routine laboratory 
analysis of a new element in the air, 
an inert gas which the great paleolinguist Larkish had named agnoton, 
the Unknown Thing, after the pattern of the similar nicknames given 
to others: neon, the New Thing; 
xenon, the Strange Thing. 

It had continued (the explanation 
ran off so automatically that his mind 
was free to range from trie next line 
of the epic to the interesting question of whether the presence of ear 
lobes would damage the symmetry of 
Lavra's perfect face) it had continued with the itching and sneezing, 
the coughing and wheezing, with the 
increase of the percentage of agnoton in the atmosphere, promptly passing any other inert gas, even argon, 
and soon rivaling oxygen itself. 

And it had culminated (no, the 
lines were cleaner without lobes) , on 
that day when only the three of them 
were here in this retreat, with the 
discovery that the human race was 
allergic to agnoton. 



Allergies had been conquered for 
a decade of ■ generations. Their cure, 
even their palliation, had been forgotten. And mankind coughed and 
sneezed and itched . . . and died. For 
while the allergies of the ancient past 
produced only agonies to make the 
patient long for death, agnoton 
brought on racking and ince'ssant 
spasms of coughing and sneezing 
which no heart could long withstand. 

"So if -you leave this shelter, my 
dear/' Vyrko concluded, "you too 
will fight for every breath and twist 
your body in torment until your heart 
decides that it is all just too much 
trouble. Here we are safe, because 
your father's eczema was the only 
known case of allergy in centuries — 
and was traced to the inert gases. 
Here is the only air-conditioning in 
the world that excludes the inert 
gases — and with them agnoton. And 
here—" 

LAVRA leaned forward, a smile 
and a red fleck of apple skin on 
her lips, the apples of her breasts 
touching Vyrko's shoulders. This too 
was part of the gambit. 

Usually it was merely declined. 
(Tyrsa stood between them. Tyrsa, 
who sang well and talked better; 
whose plain face and beautiful throat 
were alike racked by agonton . . .) 
This time the gambit was interrupted. 

Kirth-Labbery himself had come 
in unnoticed. His old voice was thin 
with weariness, sharp with impatience. "And here we are, safe in 



58 




 



perpetuity, with our air-conditioning, 
our energy plant, our hydroponics! 
Safe in perpetual siege, besieged by 
an inert 'gas!" 

Vyrko grinned. "Undignified, isn't 
it?" 

Kirth-Labbery managed to laugh at 
himself. "Damn your secretarial hide, 
Vyrko. I love you like a son, but if 
I had one man who knew a meson 
from a metazoon to help me in the 
laboratory. . . ." 

"You'll find something, Father," 
Lavra said vaguely. 

Her father regarded her with an 
odd seriousness. "Lavra," he said, 
"your beauty is the greatest thing 
that I have wrought — with a certain 
assistance, I'll grant, from the genes 
so obviously carried by your mother. 
That beauty alone still has meaning. 
The sight of you would bring a momentary happiness even to a man 
choking in his last spasms, while our 
great web of civilization. . . ." 

He absently left the sentence unfinished and switched on the video 
screen. He had to try a dozen channels before he found one that was 
still casting. When every erg of a 
man's energy goes to drawing his 
next breath, he cannot tend his machine. 

At last Kirth-Labbery picked up 
a Nyork newscast. The announcer 
was sneezing badly ("The older literature," Vyrko observed, "found 
sneezing comic . . ."), but still contriving to speak, and somewhere a 
group of technicians must have had 
partial control of themselves. 



"Four hundred and seventy-two 
planes have crashed," the announcer 
said, "in the past forty-eight hours. 
Civil authorities have forbidden further'plane travel indefinitely because 
of the danger of spasms at the con-_ 
trols, and it is rumored that all vehicular transport whatsoever is to come 
under the same ban. No Rocklipper 
has arrived from Lunn for over a 
week, and it is thirty-six hours since 
we have made contact with the Lunn 
telestation. Yurp has been silent for 
over two days, and Asia a week.. 

" 'The most serious threat of this 
epidemic,' the head of the Academy 
has said in an authorized statement, 
'is the complete disruption of the systems of communication upon which 
world civilization is based. When 
man becomes physically incapable of 
governing his machines . . .' " 

IT WAS then that they saiw the first 
of the yellow bands. 
It was just that: a band of bright 
yellow some thirty centimeters wide, 
about five meters long, and so thin 
as to seem, insubstantial, a mere 
stripe of color. It came underneath 
the backdrop behind the announcer. 
It streaked about the casting room 
with questing sinuosity. No features, 
no appendages relieved its yellow 
blankness. 

Then with a deft whipping motion it wrapped itself around the announcer. It held him only an instant. 
His hideously shriveled body plunged 
toward the camera as the screen went 
dead. 



TRANSFFR POINT 



5? 



That was the start of the horror. 

Vyrko, naturally, had no idea of 
the origin of the yellow bands. Even 
Kirth-Labbery could offer no more 
than conjectures. From another 
planet, another system, another 
galaxy, another universe. . . . 

It did not matter. Precise knowledge had now lost its importance. 
Kirth-Labbery was almost as indifferent to the problem as was Lavra; 
he speculated on it out of sheer habit. 
What signified was that Jhe yellow 
bands were alien, and that they were 
rapidly and precisely completing the 
destruction of mankind begun by the 
agnoton. 

"Their arrival immediately after 
the epidemic," Kirth-Labbery concluded, "cannot be coincidence. You 
will observe that they function freely 
in an agnoton-laden atmosphere." 

"It would be interesting," Vyrko 
commented, "to visualize a band 
sneezing. . . ." 

"It's possible," the scientist corrected, "that the agnoton was a poison-gas barrage laid down to soften 
Earth for their coming; but is it likely that they could know that a gas 
harmless to them would be lethal to 
other life? It's more probable that 
they learned from spectroscopic 
analysis that the atmosphere of Earth 
lacked an element essential to them, 
which they supplied before invading." 

Vyrko considered the problem 
while Lavra sliced a peach with delicate grace. She was unable to resist 
licking the juice from her fingers. 



"Then if the agnoton," he ventured, "is something that they imported, is it possible that their supply 
might run short?" 

Kirth-Labbery fiddled with the 
dials under the screen. It was still 
possible to pick up occasional 
glimpses from remote sectors, though 
by now the heart sickened in advance 
at the knowledge of the inevitable 
end of the cast. 

"It is possible, Vyrko. It is the 
only hope. The three of us here, 
where the agnoton and the yellow 
bands are alike helpless to enter, 
may continue our self-sufficient existence long enough to outlast the in-' 
vaders. Perhaps somewhere on Earth 
there are other such nuclei, but I 
doubt it. We are the whole of the 
future . . , and I am old." 

VYRKO frowned. He resented the 
terrible weight of a burden that 
he did not want but could not reject. 
He felt himself at once oppressed 
and ennobled. Lavra went on eating 
her peach. 

The video screen sprang into light. 
A young man with the tense, lined 
face of premature age spoke hastily, 
urgently. "To all of you, if there are 
any of you ... I have heard no answer for two days now . .' . It is 
chance that I am here. But watch, all 
of you ! I have found how the yellow bands came here. I am going to 
turn the camera on it now . . . 
watch!" 

The field of vision panned to 
something that was for tt moment 



60 




 



totally incomprehensible. "This is 
their ship," the old young man 
gasped. It was a set of bars of a 
metal almost exactly the color- of the 
bands themselves, and it appeared in 
the first instant like a three-dimensional projection of a tesseract. Then 
as they looked at it, their eyes seemed 
to follow strange new angles. Possibilities of vision opened up beyond 
their capacities. For a moment they 
seemed to see what the human eye 
was not framed to grasp. 

"They come," the voice panted on, 
"from . . ." 

The voice and the screen went 
dead. Vyrko covered his eyes with 
his hands. Darkness was infinite relief. A minute passed before he felt 
that he could endure once more even 
the normal exercise of the optic 
nerve. He opened his eyes sharply at 
a little scream from Lavra. 

He opened them to see how still 
Kirth-Labbery sat. The human heart, 
too, is framed to endure only so 
much; and, as the scientist had said, 
he was old. 

IT WAS three days after KirthLabbery's death before Vyrko had 
brought his prose-and-verse record 
up to date. Nothing more had appeared on the video, even after the 
most patient hours of knob-twirling. 
Now Vyrko leaned back from the 
keyboard and contemplated his completed record — and then sat forward 
with abrupt shock at the thought of 
that word completed. 

There was nothing more to write. 



The situation was not novel in" 
literature. He had read many treatments, and even written a rather successful satire on the theme himself. 
But here was the truth itself. 

He was that most imagination-stirring of all figures, The Lost Man on 
Earth. -And he found it a boring 
situation. 

Kirth-Labbery, had he lived, would 
have devoted his energies in the 
laboratory to an effort, even conceivably a successful one, to destroy 
the invaders. Vyrko knew his own 
limitations too well to attempt that. 

Vrist, his gay wild twin, who had 
been in Lunn on yet another of his 
fantastic ventures when the agnoton 
struck — Vrist would have dreamed 
up some gallant feat of physical 
prowess to make the invaders pay 
dearly for his life. Vyrko found itdifficult to cast himself in so. swashbuckling a -role. 

He had never envied Vrist till 
now. Be jealous of the dead; only the 
living are alone. Vyrko smiled as he 
recalled the line from one of his 
early poems. It had been only the 
expression of a pose when he wrote 
it, a mood for a song that Tyrsa 
would sing well . . . 

It was in this mood that he found 
(the ancient word had no modern 
counterpart) the pulps. 

HE KNEW their history: how 
some eccentric of two thousand 
years ago (the name was variously 
rendered as Trees or Tiller) had 
buried them in a hermetic capsule to 



TRANSFER POINT 



41 



check against the future; how Tarabal had dug them up some fifty years 
ago; how Kirth-Labbery had spent 
almost the entire Hartl Prize for 
them because, as he used to assert, 
their 'incredible mixture of exact 
prophecy and arrant nonsense offered 
■the perfect proof of the greatness 
and helplessness of human ingenuity. 

But Vyrko had never read them 
before. They would at least be a 
novelty to deaden the boredom of his 
classically dramatic situation. He 
passed a more than pleasant hour 
with Galaxy and Surprising and the 
rest, needing the dictionary but rarely. He was particularly impressed by 
one story detailing, with the most 
precise minutiae, the. politics of the 
American Religious Wars — a subject 
on which he himself had based a not 
unsuccessful novel. By one Norbert 
Holt, he observed. Extraordinary how 
exact a forecast . . . and yet extraordinary too how many of the stories 
dealt with space- and time-travel, 
which the race had never yet attained 
and now never would . . . 

And inevitably there was a story, 
a neat and witty one by an author 
named Knight, about the Last Man 
on Earth. He read it and smiled, first 
at the story and then at his own 
stupidity. 

He found Lavra in the laboratory, 
of all unexpected places. 

She was staring fixedly at one corner, where the light did not strike 
clearly. 

"What's so fascinating?" Vyrko 
asked. 

62 



Lavra turned suddenly. Her hair 
and her flesh rippled with the perfect grace of the movement. "I was 
thinking . . ." 

Vyrko's half-formed intent toward 
her permitted no comment on that 
improbable statement. 

"The day before Father . . . died, 
I was in here with him and I asked 
if there was any hope of our escaping ever. Only this time he answered 
me. He said yes, there was a way 
out, but he was afraid of it. It was 
an idea he'd worked on but never 
tried. And we'd be wiser not to try 
it, he said." 

"I don't believe in arguing with 
your father — even post mortem." 

"But I can't help wondering . . . 
And when he said it, he looked over 
at that corner." 

VYRKO went to that corner and 
drew back a curtain. There was a 
chair of metal rods, and a crude control panel, though it was hard to see 
what it was intended to control. He 
dropped the curtain. 

For a moment he stood watching 
Lavra. She was a fool, but she was 
exceedingly lovely. And the child of 
Kirth-Labbery could hardly carry only 
a fool's genes. 

Several generations could grow up 
in this retreat before the inevitable 
failure of the most permanent mechanical installations made it uninhabitable. By that time Earth would 
be free of agnoton and yellow bands, 
or they would be so firmly established 
that there was no hope. The third 


 



generation would go forth into the 
world, to perish or . . . 

He walked over to Lavra* and laid 
a gentle hand on her golden hair. 

"V 7YRKO never understood whether 
V Lavra had been bored before that 
time. A life of undemanding inaction with plenty of food may well 
have sumced her. Certainly she was' 
not bored now. 

At first she was merely passive; 
Vyrko had always suspected that she 
had meant the gambit to be declined. 
Then as her interest mounted and 
Vyrko began to compliment himself 
on his ability as an instructor, they 
became certain of their success; and 
from that point on she was rapt with 
the fascination of the changes in herself. 

But even this new development 
did not totally rid Vyrko of his own 
ennui. If there were only something 
he could do, some positive, Vristian, 
Kirth-Labberian step that he could 
take! He damned himself for having 
been an incompetent esthetic fool, 
who had taken so for granted the scientific wonders of his age that he had 
never learned what made them tick, 
or how greater wonders might be 
attained. 

He slept too much, he ate too 
much, for a brief period he drank too 
much — until he found boredom even 
less attractive with a hangover. 

He tried to write, but the terrible 
uncertainty of any future audience 
disheartened him. 

Sometimes a week would pass 

TRANSFER POINT 



without his consciously thinking of 
agnoton or the yellow bands. Then 
he would spend a day flogging himself into a state of nervous tension 
worthy of his uniquely dramatic situation, but he would always relapse. 
There just wasn't anything to do. 

Now even the consolation of 
Lavra's beauty was vanishing, and 
she began demanding odd items of 
food which the hydroponic garden 
could not supply. 

"If you loved me, you'd find a 
way to make cheese . . ." or " . . . 
grow a new kind of peach ... a 
little like a grape, only different . . ." 

It was while he was listening to 
a film wire of Ty'rsa's (the last she 
ever made, in the curious tonalities 
of that newly rediscovered Mozart 
opera) and seeing her homely face, 
made even less lovely by the effort of 
those effortless-sounding notes, that 
he became conscious of the operative 
phrase. 

"If you loved me . . ."' 

"Have I ever said I did?" he 
snapped. 

He saw a new and not readily understood expression mar the beauty 
of Lavra's face. "No," she said in 
sudden surprise. "No," and her voice 
fell to flatness, "you haven't . . ." 

And as her sobs — the first he had 
ever heard from her — traveled away 
toward the hydroponic room, he felt 
a new and not readily understood 
emotion. He switched off the film 
wire midway through the pyrotechnic 
rage of the eighteenth-century queen 
of darkness. 

63 



VYRKO found a curious refuge 
in the pulps. There was a perverse satisfaction in reading the 
thrilling exploits of other Last Men 
on Earth. He could feel through th'em 
the emotions that he should be feeling directly. And the other stories 
were fun, too, in varying ways. For 
instance, that astonishingly accurate 
account of the delicate maneuvering 
which averted what threatened to be. 
the first and final Atomic War . . . 

He noticed one oddity: Every absolutely correct story of the "future" 
bore the same by-line. Occasionally 
other writers made good guesses, predicted logical trends, foresaw inevitable extrapolations. But only Norbert Holt named names and dated 
dates with perfect historical accuracy. 

It wasn't possible. It was too precise to be plausible. It was far more 
spectacular than the erratic Nostradamus often discussed in the pulps. 

But there it was\ He had read the 
Holt stories solidly through in order 
i half-dozen times, without finding a 
single flaw, when he discovered the 
copy of Surprising Stories that had 
ilipped behind a shelf and was therefore new to him. 

He looked at once at the contents 
page. Yes, there was a Holt and — he 
felt a twinge of irrational but poignant sadness — one labeled as posthumous. 

This story, we regret to tell 
you, is incomplete, and not only 
because of Norbert Holt's tragic 
death last month. This is the 



last in chronological order of 
Holt's stories of a consistently 
plotted future; but this fragment 
was written before his masterpiece, The Siege of Limn. Holt 
himself used to tell me that he 
could never finish it, that he 
could not find an ending; and 
he died still not knowing how The Last Boredom came out. 
But here, even though in fragment form, is ,the last published 
work of the greatest writer about 
the future, Norbert Holt. 

The note was signed with the initials 
M. S. Vyrko had long sensed a more 
than professional intimacy between 
Holt and his editor, Manning Stern; 
this obituary introduction must have 
been a bitter task. But his eyes were 
hurrying on, almost fearfully, to the 
first words of The Lost Boredom: 

There were three of them in 
the retreat, three out of all mankind safe from the deadly yellow bands. The great Kirth-Lab. bery himself had constructed . . . 

Vryko blinked and started again. 
It still read the same. He took firm 
hold of the magazine, as though the 
miracle might slip between his fingers, and dashed off with more energy than he had felt in months. 

HE FOUND Lavra in the hydroponic room. "I have just 
found," he shouted, "the damnedest 
unbelievable — " • 




 



"Darling," said Lavra, "I want 
some meat." 

"Don't be silly. We haven't any 
meat. Nobody's eaten meat except at 
ritual dinners for generations." . . 

"Then I want a ritual dinner." 

"You can go on wanting. But look 
at this! Just read those first lines!" 

"Vyrko," she pleaded, "I want it." 

"Don't be an idiot!" 

Her lips pouted and her eyes moistened. "Vyrko dear . . . What you 
said when you were listening to that 
funny music . . . Don't you love 
me?" 

"No," 'he barked. 

Her eyes overflowed. "You don't 
love me? Not after . . .?" 

All Vyrko's pent-up boredom and 
irritation erupted. "You're beautiful, 
Lavra, or you were a few months ago, 
but you're an idiot. I am not in the 
habit of loving idiots/' 

"But you . . ." 

"I tried to assure the perpetuation 
of the race — questionable though the 
desirability of such a project seems 
at the moment. It was not an unpleasant task, but I'm damned if it 
gives you the right in perpetuity to 
'pester me." 

She moaned a little as he slammed 
out of the room. He felt oddly better. Adrenalin is a fine thing for the 
system. He settled into a chair and 
resolutely read, his eyes bugging like 
a cover-monster's with amazed disbelief. When he reached the verbatim 
account of the quarrel he had just 
enjoyed, he dropped the magazine. 

It sounded so petty in print. Such 



stupid inane bickering in the face 
of . . ; He left the magazine lying 
there and went back to the hydroponic room. 

Lavra was crying — noiselessly this 
time, which somehow made it worse. 
One hand had automatically plucked 
a ripe grape, but she was not eating 
it. He went up behind her and 
slipped his hand under her long hair 1 
and began stroking the nape of her 
neck.' The soundless sobs diminished 
gradually. When his fingers moved 
tenderly behind her ears, she turned 
to him with parted lips. The grape 
fell from her hand. 

"I'm sorry," he heard himself saying. "It's me that's the idiot. Which, 
I repeat, I am not in the habit of 
loving. And you're the mother of my 
twins and I do love you . . ." And 
he realized that the statement was 
quite possibly, if absurdly, true. 

"I don't want anything now," 
Lavra said when words were again 
in order. She stretched contentedly, 
and she was still beautiful even in 
the ungainly distortion which might 
preserve a race. "Now what were you 
trying to tell me?" 

HE EXPLAINED. "And this Holt 
is always right," he ended. 
"And now he's writing about us!" 
"Oh! Oh, then we'll know—" 
"We'll know everything. We'll 
know what the yellow bands are and 
what becomes of them and what happens to mankind and — " 

" — and .we'll know," said Lavra, 
"whether it's a boy or a girl." 



TRANSFER POINT

Vyrko smiled. "Twins, I told you. 
It runs in my family — no less than 
one pair to a generation. And I think 
that's it — Holt's already planted the 
fact of my having a twin named 
Vrist, even though he doesn't come 
into the action." 

"Twins . . . That wofild be nice. 
They wouldn't be lonely until we 
•could . . . But get it quick, dear. 
Read it to me; I can't wait!" 

So he read Norbert Holt's story to 
her — too excited and too oddly affectionate to point out that her longstanding aversion for sprint persisted 
even when she herself was a character. He read on past the quarrel. He 
read a printable version of the past 
hour. He read, about himself reading 
the story to her. 

"Now!" she cried. "We're up to 
now. What happens next?" 

Vyrko read: 

The emotional release of 
anger and love had set Vyrko 
almost at peace with himself 
again; but a small restlessness 
still nibbled at his brain. 

Irrelevantly he remembered 
Kirth-Labbery's cryptic hint of 
escape. Escape for the two of 
them, happy now; for the two 
of them and for their ... it had 
to be, according to the odds, 
their twins. 

He sauntered curiously into 
the laboratory, Lavra following 
him. He drew back the curtain 
and stared at the chair of metal 
rods. It was hard to see the con
44 



trol board that seemed to control nothing. He sat in the chair 
for a better look. 

He made puzzled grunting 
noises. Lavra, her curiosity finally stirred by something inedible, 
reached over his shoulder and 
poked at the green button. 

"T DON'T like that last thing he 

X says about me," Lavra objected. 
"I don't like anything he says about 
me. I think your Mr. Holt is a very 
nasty person." ■ 

"He says you're beautiful." 

"And he says you love me. Or 
does he? It's all mixed up." 

"It is all mixed up . . . and I do 
love you." 

The kiss was a short one; Lavra 
had to say, "And what next?" 

"That's all. It ends there." 

"Well . . . Aren't you . . .?" 

Vyrko felt strange. Holt had described his feelings so precisely. He 
was at peace and still curious, and 
the thought of Kirth-Labbery's escape method did nibble restlessly at 
his brain. 

He rose "and sauntered into the 
laboratory, Lavra following him. He. 
drew back the curtain and stared at 
the chair of metal rods. It was hard 
to see the control board that seemed 
to control nothing. He sat in the 
chair for a better look. 

He made puzzled grunting noises ; 
Lavra', her curiosity finally stirred by 
something inedible, reached over his 
shoulder and poked at the green button. 


 



VYRKO had no time for amazement when Lavra and the laborai 

tory vanished. He saw the archaic 
vehicle bearing down directly upon 
him and tried to get out of the way 
as rapidly as possible. But the chair 
hampered him and before he could 
get to his feet the vehicle struck. 
There was a red explosion of pain 
and then a long blackness. 

He later recalled a moment of consciousness at the hospital and a shrill 
female voice repeating over and over, 
"But he wasn't there and then all of 
a sudden he was and I hit him. It 
was like he came out of nowhere. He 
wasn't there and all of a sudden . . ." 
Then the blackness came back. 

All the time of his unconsciousness, all through the semi-conscious 
nightmares while doctors probed at 
him and his fever soared, his unconscious mind must have been working 
on the problem. He knew the complete answer the instant that he saw 
the paper on his breakfast tray, that 
first day he was capable of truly seeing anything. 

The paper was easy to read for a 
paleolinguist with special training in 
pulps — easier than the curious concept of breakfast was to assimilate. 
What mattered was the date. 1948 — 
and the headlines refreshed his 
knowledge of the Cold War and the 
impending election. (There was 
something he should /remember about 
that election. . . .) 

He saw it clearly. Kirth-Labbery's 
genius had at last evolved a time 
machine. That was the one escape, 



the escape which the scientist had not 
yet tested and rather distrusted. And 
Lavra had poked the (green button 
because Norbert Holt had said she 
had poked (would poke?) the green 
button. 

How many buttons could a wood' 
poke poke if a wood poke would 
poke . . 

"The breakfast didn't seem to 
agree with him, doctor." 

"Maybe it was the paper. Makes 
me run a temperature every morning, too!" 

"Oh, doctor, you do say the funniest things!" 

"Nothing funnier than this case. 
Total amnesia, as best we can judge 
by his lucid moments. And his clothes 
don't help us — must've been on his 
way to a fancy-dress party. Or maybe I should say fancy-»»dress !" 

"Oh, doctor!" 

"Don't tell me nurses can blush. 
Never 'did when I was an intern — 
and you can't say they didn't get a 
chance! But this character here . . . 
not a blessed bit of identification on 
him! Riding some kind of newfangled bike that got smashed up . . . 
Better hold off on the solid food for 
a bit — stick to intravenous feeding." 

HE'D HAD this trouble before at 
ritual dinners, Vyrko finally recalled. Meat was apt to affect him 
badly — the trouble was that he had 
not at first recognized those odd 
strips of oily solid which accompanied the egg as meat. 

The adjustment was gradual and 



TRANSFER POINT 



successful, in this as in other matters. At the end of two weeks, he 
was eating meat easily (and, he confessed, with a faintly obscene nonritaal pleasure) and equally easily 
charting with nurses and fellow patients about the events (which he still 
privately tended to regard as mummified museum pieces) of 1948. 

His adjustment, in fact, was soon 
so successful that it could not continue. The doctor made that clear. • 

"Got to think about the future, you 
know. Can't keep you here forever. 
Nasty unreasonable prejudice against 
keeping well men in hospitals." 

Vyrko allowed the expected laugh 
to come forth. "But since," he said, 
gladly accepting the explanation that 
was so much more credible than the 
truth, "I haven't any idea who I am, 
where I live, or what my profession 
is — " 

"Can't remember anything? Don't 
know if you can take shorthand, for 
instance? Qr play the bull fiddle?" 

"Not a thing." Vyrko felt it hardly worth while to point out his one 
manual accomplishment, the operation of the as-yet-uninvented dec 
tronic typewriter. 

"Behold," he thought, "the Man 
of the Future. I've read all the time 
travel stories. I know what should 
happen. I teach them everything 
Kirth-iLabbery knew and I'm the 
greatest man in the world. Only the 
fictional time travel never happens to 
a poor dope who took for granted all 
•■he science around him, who pushed 
a button or turned a knob and never 



gave a damn what happened or why. 
Here they're just beginning to get 
two-dimensional black-and-w h -i t e 
short-range television. We had (will 
have?) stereoscopic full-color worldwide video — which I'm about as 
capable of constructing' here as my 
friend the doctor would be of installing electric light in Ancient Rome. 
The Mouse of the Future . . ." 

The doctor had been thinking, too. 
He said, "Notice you're a great 
reader. Librarian's been telling me 
about you — went through the whole 
damn hospital library like a bookworm with a tapeworm!" 

Vyrko laughed dutifully. "I like 
to read," he admitted. 

"Every try writing?" the doctor 
asked abrupty, almost in the tone in 
which he might reluctantly advise a 
girl that her logical future lay in 
Port Said. 

This time Vyrko really laughed. 
"That does seem to ring a bell, you 
know ... It might be worth trying. 
But at that, what do I live on until 
I get started?" 

"Hospital trustees here administer 
a rehabilitation fund. Might wangle 
a loan. Won't be much, of course; 
but I always say a single man's got 
only one mouth to feed — and if he 
feeds more, he won't be single long!" 

"A little," said Vyrko with a 
glance at the newspaper headlines, 
"might go a long way." 

IT DID. There was the loan itself, 
which gave him a bank account 
on which, in turn, he could acquire 



48 




 

v 



other short-term loans — at exorbitant 
interest. And there was the election. 

He had- finally rsconstructed what 
he should know about it. There had 
been a brilliant Wheel-of-If .story in 
one of the much later pulps, on If 
1 the Republicans had won the 1948 
election. Which meant that actually 
they had lost; and here, in October 
of 1948, all newspapers, all commentators, and most important, all 
gamblers, were convinced that they 
must infallibly win. 

On Wednesday, November third, 
Vyrko repaid his debts and settled 
down to his writing career, comfortably guaranteed against immediate 
starvation. 

A Jialf-dozen attempts at standard 
fiction failed wretchedly. A matter of 
"tone," editors remarked vaguely, on 
the rare occasions when they did not 
confine themselves to the even vaguer 
phrases of printed rejection forms. A 
little poetry sold — "if you can call 
that selling," Vyrko thought bitterly, comparing the financial position 
of the poet here and in his own 
world. 

His failures were beginning to 
bring back the bitterness and boredom, and his thoughts turned more 
and more to that future to which he 
could never know the answer. 

Twins. It had to be twins — of 
opposite sexes, of course. The only 
hope of the continuance of the race 
lay in a matter of odds and genetics. 

Odds' .. . . He began to think of 
the election bet, to figure other angles 
with which he could turn foreknowl• 

TRANSFER POINT 



edge to profit. But his pulp-xeading 
had filled his mind with fears of the 
paradoxes involved. He had calculated the election bets carefully; they 
could not affect the outcome of the 
election, they could not even, in their 
proportionately small size, affect the 
odds. But any further step . . . 

Vyrko was, like most conceited 
men, fond of self -contempt, which 
he felt he could occasionally afford 
to indulge in. Possibly his strongest 
access of self -contempt came when' 
he realized the simplicity of the solution to all his problems. 

He could write for the science fiction pulps. 

The one thing that he could handle convincingly and skilfully,' with 
the proper "tone," was the future. 
Possibly start off with a story on the 
Religious Wars; he'd done all that 
research on his novel. Then . . . 

It was not until he was about to 
mail the manuscript that the full pattern of the truth struck him. 

Soberly, yet half-grinning, he 
crossed out KIRTH VYRKO on the 
first page . and wrote NORBERT 
HOLT. 

MANNING STERN rejoiced 
loudly in this fresh discovery. 
"This boy's got it! He makes it 
sound so real that . . ." The business office was instructed to pay the' 
highest bonus rate (unheard of for 
a first story) and an intensely cordial letter went to the author outlining immediate needs and offering 
certain story suggestions.

The editor of Surprising was no 
Little surprised at the answer: 

... I regret to say that all my 
stories will be based on one consistent scheme of future events 
and 'that you must allow me to 
stick to my own choice of material . . . 

A ND who the hell," Manning 

XX Stern demanded, "is editing 
this magazine?" and dictated a somewhat peremptory suggestion for a 
personal interview. 

The features were small and sharp, 
and the face had a sort of dark alive- ness. It was a different beauty from 
Lavra's, and an infinitely different 
beauty from the curious standards set 
by the 1949 films; but it was beauty 
and it spoke to Norbert Holt. 

"You'll forgive a certain surprise, 
Miss Stern," he ventured. "I've read 
Surprising for so many years and 
never thought ..." 

Manning Stern grinned. "That the 
editor was also surprising? I'm used 
to it — your reaction, I mean. I don't 
think I'll ever be quite used to being 
a woman ... or a human being, for 
that matter." , 

"Isn't it rather unusual? From 
what I know of the field . . ." 

"Please God, when I find a man 
who can write, don't let him go all 
male-chauvinist on me! I'm a good 
editor, said she with becoming modesty (and don't you ever forget it!) 
and I'm a good scientist. I even 
worked on the Manhattan Project — 

70 



until some character discovered that 
my adopted daughter was a Spanish 
War orphan. But what we're here to 
talk about is this consistent-scheme 
gimmick of yours. It's all right, of 
course; it's been done before. But 
where I frankly think you're crazy is 
in planning to do it exclusively." 

Norbert Holt opened his briefcase. 
"I've brought along an outline that 
might help convince you . . ." 

An hour later Manning Stern 
glanced at her watch and announced, 
"End of office hours! Care to continue this slugfest over a martini or 
five? I warn you — the more I'm 
plied, the less pliant I get." 

And an hour after, that she stated, 
"We might get some place ^if we'd 
stay some place. I mean the subject . 
seems to be getting elusive." 

"The hell," Norbert Holt announced recklessly, "with editorial 
relations. Let's get back to the current state of the opera." 

"It was paintings. I was telling 
you about the show at the — •" , , 

"No, I remember now. It was 
movies. You were trying to explain 
the Marx Brothers. Unsuccessfully, I 
may add." 

"Un . . . sue . . . cess . . . fully," 
said Manning Stern ruminatively. 
"Five martinis and the man can say 
unsuccessfully successfully. But I try 
to explain the Marx Brothers yet! 
Look, Holt. I've got a subversive orphan at home and she's undoubtedly 
starving. I've got to feed her. You 
.come home and meet her and have 
potluck, huh?" 


 



"Good. Fine. Always like to try a 
new dish." 

- Manning Stern looked at him curiously. "Now was that a gag or not? 
You're funny, Holt. You know a lot 
about everything and then all of a 
sudden you go all Man-from-Mars 
on the simplest thing. Or do you ? . . . 
Anyway, let's go feed Raquel." 

And five 'hours later Holt was saying, "I never thought I'd have this 
reason for being glad I sold a story. 
Manning, I haven't had so much fun 
talking to — <I almost said 'to a woman.' I haven't had so much fun talking since — " 

He had almost said since the agnoton came. She seemed not to notice 
his abrupt halt. She simply said,, 
"Bless you, Norb. Maybe you 'aren't 
a male-chauvinist. Maybe even you're 
. . . Look, go find a subway or a 
cab or something. If you stay here 
another minute, I'm either going to 
kiss you or admit you're right about 
your stories — and I don't know 
which is worse editor-author relations." 

MANNING STERN committed 
the second breach of relations 
first. The fan mail on Norbert Holt's 
debut left her oo doubt that Surprising would profit by anything he' 
chose to write about. 

She'd never seen such a phenomenally rapid rise in author popularity. Or rather you could hardly say 
rise. Holt hit— the top with his first 
story and stayed there. He socked 
the fen (Guest of Honor ■ at the 

TRANSFER POINT 



Washinvention), the pros (first 
President of Science Fiction Writers 
of America), and the general reader 
(author of the first pulp-bred science 
fiction book to stay three months on 
•the best seller list). 

And never had there been an author who was more pure damned fun 
to work with. Not that you edited 
him; you checked his copy for typos 
and sent it to the printers. (Typos 
were frequent at first; he said something odd about absurd illogical keyboard arrangement.) But just being 
with him, talking about this, that 
and those . . . Raquel, just turning 
sixteen, was quite obviously in love 
with him — praying that he'd have 
the decency to stay single till she 
grew up and "You know, Manningcita, I am Spanish; and the Mediterranean girls . ..." 

But there was this occasional feeling of oddness. Like the potluck and 
the illogical keyboard and that night 
at SCWA ... 

"I've got a story problem," Nor"bert Holt announced there. "An idea, 
and I can't lick it. Maybe if I toss 
it out to the literary lions . . ." 

"Story problem?" Manning said, a 
littie more sharply than she'd intended. "I thought everything was outlined for the next ten years." 

"This is different. This is^a sort of 
paradox story, and I can't get out of 
it. It won't end. Somthing like this: 
Suppose a man in the remote year X 
reads a story that tells him how to 
work a time machine. So he works 
the time machine and goes back to 

71 



the year X minus 2000 — let's say, for 
instance, our time. So in 'now' he 
writes the story that ■ he's going to 
read two thousand years later, telling 
himself how to work the time machine because he knows how to work 
it because he read the story which he 
wrote because — ' 

Manning was starting to say "Hold 
it!" when Matt Duncan interrupted 
with, "Good old endless-cycle gimmick. Lot of fun to kick around, but 
Bob PJeinlein did it once and for all 
in By His Bootstraps. Damnedest 
tour de force I ever read; there just 
aren't any switcheroos left." 

"Ouroboros," Joe Henderson contributed. 

Norbert Holt looked a vain question at him; they knew that one word 
per evening was Joe's maximum contribution. . 

Austin Carter picked it up. "Ouroboros, the worm that circles the universe with its tail in its mouth. The 
Asgard Serpent, too. And I think 
there's something in Mayan literature. All symbols of infinity — no beginning, no ending. Always out by 
the same door where you went in. 
•See that magnificent novel of Eddison's, The Worm Ouroboros; the 
perfect cyclic novel, ending with its 
recommencement, stopping not because there's a stopping place, but 
because it's uneconomical to print the 
whole text over infinitely." 

"The Quaker Oats box," said Duncan. "With a Quaker holding a box 
with a Quaker holding a box with 
a Quaker holding a . . "." 



It was standard professional shoptalk. It was a fine evening with the 
boys. But there was a look of infinitely remote sadness in Norbert 
Holt's eyes. 

That was the evening that Manning violated her first rule of editorauthor relationships. 

THEY were having martinis in the 
same bar in which Norbert had, 
so many years ago, successfully said 
unsuccessfully. 

"They've been good years," he remarked, apparently to the olive. • 

There was something wrong with 
this evening. No bounce. No yumph. 
"That's a funny tense," Manning 
•confided to her own olive. "Aren't 
they still good years?" 

"I've owed you a serious talk for 
a long time." 

"You don't have to pay the debt. 
We don't go in much for being serious,- do we? Not so dead-earnest-, 
catch-in-the-throat serious." 
"Don't we?" . ./ 
"I've got an awful feeling," Manning admitted, "that you're building 
up to a proposal, either to me or that 
olive. And if it's me, I've got an 
awful feeling I'm going to accept — 
and Raquel will never forgive me." 

"You're safe," Norbert said dryly. 
"That's the serious talk. I want to 
marry you, darling, and I'm not going to." 

"I suppose this is the time you 
twirl your black mustache and tell 
me you have a wife and family elsewhere?"' 



72 




 



"I hope to God I have!" 

""No, it wasn't very funny, was 
it?" Manning felt very little, aside 
from wishing she were dead. 

"I can't tell you the truth," he 
went on. "You wouldn't believe it. 
I've loved two women before; one 
had talent and a brain, the other had 
beauty and no brain. I think I loved 
her. The damnedest curse of Ouroboros is that I'll never quite know. 
If I coyfd take that tail out of that 
mouth . . ." 

"Go on," she encouraged a little 
wildly. "Talk plot-gimmicks. It's easier on me." 

"And she is carrying . . . will 
carry ... my child — my children, it_ 
must be. My twins ..." 

"Look, Holt. We came in here edit 
tor and author — remember back 
when? Let's go out that way. Don't 
go on talking. I'm a big girl, but I 
can't take . . . everything. It's been 
fun knowing you and all future manuscripts will be gratefully received." 

"I knew I couldn't say it. I 
shouldn't have tried. But there won't 
be any future manuscripts. I've written every Holt I've ever read." 

"Does that make sense?" Manning 
aimed the remark at the olive, but it 
was gone. So was the martini. 

"Here's 'the last." He took it out 
of his breast-pocket, neatly folded. 
"The one we talked about at SCWA 
— the one I couldn't end. Maybe 
you'll understand. I wanted somehow 
to make it clear before . . ." 

The tone of his voice projected a 
sense of doom, and Manning forgot 



everything else. "Is something going 
to happen to you? Are you going to 
— Oh, my dear, no! All right, so you 
have a wife on every space station 
in the asteroid belt; but if anything 
happens to you . . ." 

"I don't know," said Norbert 
Hdlt. "I can't remember the exact 
date of that issue . . ." He rose 
abruptly. "I shouldn't have tried a 
goodbye. See you again, darling — 
the next time round Ouroboros." 

She was still staring at the empty 
martini glass when she heard the 
shrill of brakes and the- exoited upspringing of a crowd outside. 

SHE read the posthumous fragment late that night, after 
her eyes had dried sufficiently to 
make the operation practicable. And 
through her sorrow her mind fought 
to help her, making her think, making her be an editor. 

She understood a little and disbelieved what she understood. And underneath she prodded herself, "But 
it isn't a story. It's too short, too inconclusive. It'll just disappoint the 
Holt fans — and that's everybody. 
Much better if I do a straight obit, 
take up a full page on it . . ." 

She fought hard to keep on thinking, not feeling. She had never before experienced so strongly the Ihave-been-here-before sensation. She 
had been faced with this dilemma 
once before, once on some other 
time-spiral, as the boys in SCWA 
would say. And her decision had 
been . . . 



TRANSFER POINT 



"It's sentimentality," she protested. "It isn't editing. This decision's 
•right. I know it. And if I go and get 
another of these attacks and start to 
change my mind . . ." 

She laid the posthumous Holt fragment on the coals. It caught fire 
quickly. 

THE next morning Raquel greeted her with, "Manningcira, 
who's Norbert Holt?" 
' Manning had slept so restfully that 
she was even tolerant of foolish 
questions at breakfast. "Who?" she 
asked. 

"Norbert Holt. Somehow the name 



popped into my mind. Is he perhaps 
one. of your writers?" 

"Never heard of him." 

Raquel frowned. "I was almost 
sure . . . Can you really remember 
them all ? I'm going to check those 
bound volumes of Surprising." 

"Any luck with your . . . what was 
it? . . . Holt?" Manning asked the 
girl a little later. 

"No, Manningcita. I was quite unsuccessful." 

. . . unsuccessful . . . Now why 
in Heaven's name, mused Manning 
Stern, should I be thinking of martinis at breakfast time?
