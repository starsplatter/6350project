BEFORE THIS ISSUE went to 
press Alex Blade stopped by 
to admire the cover for his 
lead novel this issue, THE TATTOOED MAN. He felt that Malcolm 
Smith had done a fine job of painting — as usual — and hoped that 
Smith would be able to illustrate 
his next story. By coincidence Smitty was also in the office and he 
promptly told Alex it was easy to 
paint a good cover when he had 
a good story to work with, such as 
the Blade novel. We promptly enrolled both of them in Tales' mutual 
admiration society! While they 
blushed with some embarrassment, 
we hastened to add that we felt 
they had both done terrific jobs, 
and furthermore that the readers 
would back us up when the issue 
hit the stands. So, ok, let's hear 
from you! 

WE WELCOME back a real old 
friend this month. Robert 
Moore Williams has been one of 
our favorite writers for many years 
— we used to buy plenty of his stuff 
when we held down the post of 
managing editor of Amazing and 
Fantastic in the forties. We've been 
after Bob to turn out the type of 
action story he helped make popular 
and he promised he would. You'll 
be seeing him around pretty frequently from now on we have a 
hunch! 

B ACK IN 1938 your editor, in collaboration with Mark Reins


berg, sold his first science fiction 
story. Since then — and before — 
Mark vowed he'd turn out plenty 
of science fiction. Until recently 
his professional activities in the 
field have been confined to reviewing science fiction novels for the 
Chicago Tribune book section. We're 
happy to report Mark has turned 
to fiction now making up for lost 
time. And about time, too! See you 
next issue wlh

THE TATTOOED MAN 

h 

^Alexander i2ta.de 



THE GIRL WITH the golden eyes and warm green 
skin was becoming too friendly. Joe Chattan shook his head at 
her and laughed. He was a little 
drunk, but not too drunk to re


member that he had to be back 
aboard the Phoebus by midnight. 
He dropped two coins together into 
the girl's bodice, and patted her 
cheek, and left her, steering a difficult course between the crowded 



tables. 

Outside the low doorway, the 
steaming air of the world called 
Rigel Two did very little to revive 
him. One big bright moon was 
overhead, and another was in the 
act of setting. The shadows ran 
confused between them, and the 
coils of mist were like silver floss, 
blowing gently through the streets. 

Feeling as though his own head 
was beautifully stuffed with mist 
and moonshine, Chattan smiled 
and set out toward the starport. 

The streets straggled every which 
way. This quarter near the port 
was crowded and squalid, like similar quarters all over the lanes of 



galactic trade. The houses were 
flat-roofed, with high narrow fronts, 
and they were full of smells and 
cries, laughter and muffled voices, 
shaded lights. There was nothing to 
tell a drunken spaceman which 
street he was on. Chattan got lost. 

"Oh, well," he said to himself 
cheerfully, "there's no problem. 
All I have to do is stop and listen." 

He stopped, with the bright mist 
curling around him. He listened. 

In a few minutes he heard the 
distant, deep-toned thunder-clap of 
a ship in take-off. A streak of fire 
mounted slowly up the sky. Chattan 
turned himself to face it and began 
to walk again.

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



The streets twined and twisted, 
narrowing, widening, crossing open 
courts, clambering up and down 
steps. The moon was playing a 
game of its own, shifting stealthily 
around the sky so you couldn't get 
a bearing on it. Pretty soon, in a 
court between four quiet walls, 
.Chattan stopped again. 
He listened. 

He did not hear any ship. But 
he ieard another sound. 

The confused, fierce, furtive 
sound of secret violence. 

Chattan's face tightened and his 
eyes became foggily alert. There 
was a narrow alley opening off one 
corner of the square, and the sound 
seemed to come from there. He 
went quietly over to it. He was 
not in search of trouble. He was 
merely curious, and in the back of 
his mind hovered the thought that 
a fellow spaceman might be in need 

of help a. not unusual thing in 

neighborhoods like this. 

He looked into the alley. 

In the chequered moonlight, he 
could make out the forms of four 
men. One of them was half crouched 
with his back against the wall, 
moaning like a hurt beast and 
striking out with his hands at two 
of the other men, who pounded and 
battered at him. The fourth man 
stood by and watched, his tall body 
bent forward in an attitude of intense excitement/ 

"Now," he said. "Now!" 



He spoke in good Earth English, 
and Chattan frowned. 

One of the attackers moved in 
swiftly and struck down, hard. 
The man with his back against the 
wall whimpered and slid to the 
ground. 

Instantly the two had him pinioned, his arms behind his' back 
and his face strained up into the 
moonlight. It was a dark face. It 
looked black, but it might have 
been any of a dozen colors by 
day. There was a network of silvery markings on it, scars possibly, 
or some form of tattooing. It was 
a good face, with a fine high brow. 
It was also, incongruously, the face 
of an idiot. The eyes stared, full 
of fear but without understanding. 
The mouth opened and closed and 
panted, but no word came out, even 
of protest. 

The tall Earthman who had 
spoken before said, "Hold him." 
He bent closer to the pinioned man. 
"Lugach," he said. "Lugach?" 

The dark man whined and tried 
to break away. 

The Earthman spoke /apidly, almost savagely, in a language Chattan did not know. 

The dark man made no response, 
except to whimper. 

In what amounted to an outburst of insane fury, the Earthman 
struck the dark man several times 
across the face, continuing to speak" 
in that unfamiliar tongue. 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



9 



Chattan stepped forward. He had 
only one good reason. He was mad. 
It seemed a hell of a way to treat 
a helpless halfwit. 

The halfwit suddenly voiced a 
mighty cry and sent sprawling the 
two men who held him. It was 
as though those blows in the face 
had shocked some deep-buried center of pride and human rage. He 
sprang forward at the Earthman. 

"Good for you," said Chattan. 
He charged at the two men who 
were getting up off the ground 
and preparing to attack the dark 
man from the back. 

After that nothing was very 
clear to Chattan. The moonlight 
was full of fists and a bobbing in 
and out of angry faces. Curiously, 
there were no weapons used. But 
the men were good fighters. They 
knew all there was to know about 
alley brawls. Chattan found himself on the broad of his back, and 
when he looked around he saw that 
the halfwit had the Earthman 
down, and that the other two men 
were beating and kicking him away. 
Chattan got up, shook his head, 
and charged again. 

This time he got hold of the 
Earthman. He had a very brief but 
fairly clear glimpse of a thin intense face, corroded to the soul 
with one of" those austere passions 
that amount to monomania, and 
that leaye no room for any softer 
consideration of mercy or common 



fairness. Chattan's drunken perceptiveness saw this, and saw* also 
that this man was no ordinary 
thief or footpad, but something 
much more dangerous. 

He understood suddenly that he 
had stepped into something evil 
and complex, something that was 
none of his business. 

And it was too late, entirely too 
late. 

ALL AT ONCE the Earthman 
had a weapon. Chattan saw 
it. He grappled for it, his 
hands around the Earthman's wiry 
wrist. The Earthman came in close 
against Chattan, his eyes glazed and 
shiny like two big beads, his mouth 
twisted. The weapon made a quiet 
hissing. Smoke sprang from Chattan's uniform coat. He gave a deep 
shuddering groan and fell down 
into the dust. 

He had a dream there. He was 
all alone, floating in a silent brilliance that reeled and swam, and 
he was in very great pain. After 
a while the moon came down to 
look at him, and the closer it got 
the darker it got,, until it was all 
black except for a jseaming of^ 
silver. Then even the dream was 
gone. 

When he woke again the pain 
was still there, but dulled and far 
off. The queer brilliance was gone, 
swallowed up in a flat grayness of 
painted metal against which a single 



10 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



light-tube burned. There was something familiar about that metallic 
ceiling, and that particular type of 
fixture. Chattan frowned, and then 
he remembered, and a vague alarm 
that had been plucking at him subsided. He was looking at the ceiling of a ship's cabin. It was all 
right, then. He had made it back 
to the Phoebus, after all. 

He lay feeling peaceful and relaxed, listening to the heavy 
throbbing whine of generators in 
the deep vitals of the ship. The 
Phoebus was already in overdrive, 
out between the stars. He must 
have been unconscious a long time, 
he thought. He could not remember anything about take-off, or 
acceleration run, or shift. 

The generators sounded funny, 
somehow, but he refused to let it 
worry him. 

The cabin door opened and a girl 
came in. She looked at Chattan 
and smiled and said, "You're 
awake. That's good. How do you 
feel?" 

She came and bent over the 
bunk, and Chattan stared at her. 
There were no . girls aboard the 
Phoebus. 

"What are you doing here?" he 
asked. 

"Taking care of you." 

"Yes, but here. Aboard ship." 

She looked at him, puzzled. "I 
live here." 

She was a small girl, one of 



these pert, peppery types, with 
brown hair cut short, and extremely blue eyes. She moved lightly, as 
though her slim body was made all 
of spring steel. She looked competent. Tough was the word that came 
to Chattan's mind, but it wasn't 
quite the right one, because her 
eyes were compassionate and goodhumored. 

He said weakly, "Since when?" 

"All my born days," she answered wryly, and then asked. "Where 
do you think you are?" 

A small wedge of panic entered 
him and widened rapidly. He looked past the girl, around the cabin. 
It was not his. The sound of the 
generators became even stranger 
in his ears. 

He said, "The Phoebus?" 

She shook her head. "This is the 
Merry Andrew. It's a carny ship. 
Travelling show, you understand? 
It belongs to my father, Doc Brewer. I'm Betta." She began to peel 
the sheet back, exposing his chest. 
"What's your name? You didn't 
have any papers on you when 
Lugach brought you in, nothing to 
tell ---" 

"Lugach!" Suddenly Chattan 
remembered the fight in the alley, 
the idiot, the Earthman with the 
wild fanatic face. He looked down 
at himself. His left side was bandaged. He remembered the Earthman's weapon,- and he remembered 
falling. ... 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



ii 



He began to sweat. "What happened?" he said. "I mean, after " 

"After you were hurt? Lugach 
came back to the ship, all beaten 
and bruised. He was carrying you. 
He can't talk, but we've got so we 
understand him pretty well. We 
gathered that men had attacked 
him, and you had saved him, and 
been hurt doing it. We thought at 
first you were dead. Dad wanted to 
leave you behind, but Lugach roared, and of course he's our main 
attraction, so Dad has to keep him 
happy. So we brought you along!" 

"Well," said Chattan. "Thanks." 

She grinned. "I put in for Lugach. 
It seemed the least we could do." 
She was checking the dressings, 
very skillfully. 

"Didn't you even try to find 
out what ship was missing a mate?" 
he said angrily. "I suppose you 
realize I've lost my berth and probably my ticket I'll have one 

blazer of a time explaining " 

She answered curtly, "You're 
alive, aren't you? Be thankful for 
that." She pulled the sheet back 
up. "We didn't have any time to 
ask around. Dad just bundled up 
the show and took off. We can't 
afford any more trouble than we've 
got, mister, and when we found 
out that Lugach had been attacked 
again, we " 

"Again?" said Chattan, startled. 

"This is the second time. Before, 
-it was on Mars. Two men came 



around to the show, and they asked 
my father a lot of questions about 
it, and about Lugach, where he 
came from and so on, and Dad 
was feeling good as usual, and he 
fed them a fine line of taffy, all 
lies. That night the same two men 
tried to .kidnap Lugach. Rival 
show, I guess. We couldn't think 
of any other reason." 

"Was there a third man? A tall 
Earthman, kind of fanatic looking, 
with a thin face?" 

She shook her head slowly. "I 
didn't see anybody like that." 

"He's the one who shot me. And 
he seemed to know Lugach. Personally, I mean. He called his name, 
and he spoke to him in some language I don't know. He seemed to be 
questioning him,, and then he went 
into a wild rage when he didn't get 
any answer. Started beating 

him " Chattan paused, and 

then asked, "Who is this Lugach, 
anyway?" 

"Just a harmless idiot," said 
Betta, with a note of fondness in 
her voice. "Dad bought him a 
couple of years ago, off a tramp 
skipper who'd picked him up at 

Algol One you know, that 

unfederated system they call 
Thieves' Star. How he got there, 
is a puzzle. But dad figured he'd 
be a. draw as a curiosity. Wait, I 
think there're some posters here." 

She began to rummage in a locker. "Don't believe a word of what 



12 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



it says, though. Dad made it all 
up out of his own head, on account 
of the way Lugach is tattooed. All 
we really know about the poor 
soul is his name, and we wouldn't 
know that if it wasn't tattooed 
right on his own hands. Yes, here 
they are." 

She turned around, holding a 
gaudy poster. On it was a picture 
of Lugach, full length, in a striking pose, wearing nothing but a 
fancy kind of short kilt. His skin 
showed here as a deep garnet color, 
almost black, and it was patterned 
all over with the weird silvery 
markings. His face, in the picture, 
was lofty and remote. 

The legend, splashed in huge 
letters across the poster, said 
LUGACH --- KING OF THE 
FIRST-BORN! SEE THE MAN 
FROM THE HEARTWORLD, 
CRADLE OF HUMANITY --WIN A THOUSAND CREDITS 
IF YOU CAN READ THE MYSTERIOUS RUNES OF POWER 
WRITTEN ON HIS SKIN BY 
THE HANDS OF THE ANCIENTS! 

In more restrained type was added, "Standing offer from Scientific 
and Research Foundations across 
the Galaxy. You may be the one 
to solve the age-old mystery of 
Man's Origin!" 

"There isn't any offer, of course," 
said Betta, "any more than there's 
really a Heartworld. It's all hog


wash, but you'd be surprised how 
many people fall for it! Dad's 
safe, though - -. - the tattooing 
doesn't mean a darn thing." 

"I wonder," said Chattan, with 
a sudden odd feeling of fear. 

"What do you mean?" asked 
Betta. 

"It must mean something to that 
Earthman," said Chattan. "He 
was willing to kill me to get it." 

CHAPTER II 




HE MERRY ANDREW 
droned steadily through space 



sub-space or hyper-space, 

whichever you preferred to call it 

heading toward Sirius. And 

Joe Chattan put in the dull hours 
of flight and convalescence thinking. 

Thinking hard. Because somewhere down in his subconscious 
mind, was the conviction that he 
was not through with this curious 
dark struggle, whatever it meant. 

He had seen the face of the lean 
Earthman, and the Earthman had 
shot him, and left him fer dead in 
the alley. He would be dead now 
if it had not been for Lugach. Presumably the idiot had run off out 
of reach of his assailants at that 
point, and then had come back 

fof Chattan when they left 

probably hurriedly, since the row 
must have been heard in the surrounding houses. 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



13 



But the Earthman had paused 
long enough to take Chattan's wallet, containing all his papers and all 
his cash. Why? Obviously to make 
it seem that some ordinary lurking 
thief had killed him. 

And why had he been shot at all? 
Three active men could more or 
less easily have subdued one somewhat drunken spaceman. Or they 
could simply have gone away from 
him. They had not used any weapons on Lugach. Why then on him? 

Obviously, because he had seen 
the Earthman's face, and he had 
seen what the Earthman had been 
up to, and he could tell about it. 

The Earthman, Chattan thought, 
might be someone relatively easy 
to identify, someone of importance. 
And if that was so, it was something mighty damned powerful 
that would drive him to the acts 
he had committed. 

Something connected with Lugach. 

Doc Brewer didn't think so. 
Doc Brewer was tall, good-looking 
and affable, the sort of man you 
like on sight and wouldn't trust 
with a counterfeit nickel. He sat 
with Chattan in- the main cabin, 
drinking decorously and quarreling 
with Betta over their show's projected itinerary, which he was 
drawing up. And he said, 

"Some rival outfit is trying to 
get him, and that's all. If he had 
his wits they'd hire him away, 



but he hasn't, and so they have to 
use other methods." 

"Do you think," asked Chattan, 
"that he's valuable enough for 
someone to follow you all the Way 
from Mars to Rigel Two?" 

He looked over at the idiot, who 
was sitting as he always sat, his 
hands palm-down upon his knees, 
perfectly still, his dark, silverscarred face intense and withdrawn, 
bent over his hands as though 
some great secret was written on 
them that he must solve. 

Brewer grunted impatiently. 
"Who said they were the same 
men? Lugach pulls 'em in everywhere, and there are hungry angleshooters on every planet." He 
grabbed suddenly for the chart 
sheet. "Now what are you crossing 
out Betelgeuse for?" he demanded 
crossly of his daughter. "We did 
fine there the last trip " 

"So fine," said Betta sarcastically, "that we left owing nine 
hundred and sixty-seven credits 
for fuel and repairs to the Merry 
Andrew, and if we go within ten 
parsces of that system you are in 
trouble." She took the sheet back 
and drew an emphatic line through 
Betelgeuse. 

"Well," said Brewer grudgingly, 
"all right. I'd forgotten that." 

Chattan was still studying Lugach. The man fascinated him. In 
spite of his mental lack, there was 
a nobility about him, the dim 



14 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



echo of something lost. 

"He wasn't born an idoit," 
Chattan said. 

"Who knows?" said Brewer. 
. "Look at his face," said Chattan. 
"He's no youngster. I'd say he's 
older than you are by ten years. 
Those years left marks on his 
face, and I'll bet you anything 
you like they weren't lived by an 
idiot. Look at him now. He always 
seems to be trying to remember." 

"Yes," said Betta. "I know, poor 
fellow. And he does have a fine 
head. I suppose it could have been 
a birth injury that made him that 
way, even so." 

"Or something that happened to 
him later," Chattan said slowly. 
"A shock - - - torture, an ordeal of 

some kind those marks on 

him might be a clue. I've never 
seen anything like them before." 

"That's what makes him valuable," Brewer said. "Nobody else 
has, either." 

"And you haven't any idea what 
world he came from?" 

"Whatever it was," said Brewer, 
laughing, "it wasn't the Heartworld. But don't tell, or I'll be out 
of 'business." 

No, Chattan thought, it wasn't 
the Heartworld. Only people who 
liked to believe in wonders and the 
truthfulness of myth still clung 
to that ancient galactic legend. He 
himself had believed in it as a 
child. It was a fine stirring legend 



and it was a pity it wasn't true, 
but that was one of the penalties of 
growing up, that you had to let 
so many of the fine things go. 

TN THE BEGINNING, the 
legend said, there was one 
world and one race of men. There 
were a lot of different descriptions 
of this world and these men, according to who was retelling the story, 
but the important fact was the 
uniqueness of the human race and 
its appearance on this single world 
of all the swarming planets of the 
galaxy. > . 

These men were very wise, and 
they could do anything. They 
built great ships that flew among 
the stars, and everywhere they 
went they planted colonies, conquering one wild system after another for the use and service of 
mankind. And, said the legend, 
that was the Golden Age of galactic 
man, because the colonists grew and 
became a mdghty empire that 
spanned the stars, and all men were 
brothers, united by a single heritage and a single loyajty to the 
Heartworld from which they came. 

But time passed, the legend 
said, and the people of the colonies 
lost their singleness of identity, 
adapting to the different conditions of their different worlds, so 
that after a while there were many 
colors among them, and many 
statures, and many different 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



tongues. And they forgot that they 
were brothers, and made war on 
each other, and the great golden 
Empire fell and there were ages of 
chaos, when the people of the 
colonies sank, back into barbarism 
and the starships rusted away because no one knew how to fly 
them. And even the Heartworld 
was lost, except for the nostalgic 
legend that ran through the folklore of countless scattered stars. 

Even of the star called Sol, 
which if you believed the legend 
must have been so far on the 
frontiers of the Empire that it 
would have been among those 
colonies first forgotten. Even on 
Earth, on Sol Three, there were 
folklore traces of the old story. 
And that legend did furnish a 
beautifully simple answer to the 
problem that had astonished the 
first Earthly outrovers to other 
stars --- namely, the prevalence 
of humanoid races on every world 
within habitable limits. 

A little too beautiful and simple 
an answer. For the Empire and 
the Heartworld were only dreams. 
People who believed in them, and 
tried to prove they had existed, 
were in precisely the same position 
as those Earthmen who had once 
insisted on the reality of Atlantis. 

So Lugach did not come from the 
Heartworld: But he might have 
come from any of a score or so 
known planets, where conditions 



had produced that particular shade 
of skin among at least part of their 
inhabitants. Which was very little 
help. 

"But the Earthman knew," said 
Chattan. 

Brewer looked at him. 

"He spoke to him," Chattan 
said. "In a particular language. Not 
Universal, but a particular language." 

"Doesn't prove a thing," said 
Brewer. "Lugach didn't answer, 
did he? All" right. Your Earthman 
could have been just trying out a 
language on the chance that it 
might be the right one." He shook 
his head. "I don't think Lugach's 
got a language. Even his name is 
tattooed on him in Universal 
script. I think somebody did that 
so he wouldn't have to learn a 
new name to answer to every time 
he shifted around." 

"A funny place to put it," said 
Chattan, "on the hacks of his 
hands, and right way up for him to 
see. And it's funny how he sits 
there by the hour, staring at them." 

"What else has he got to look 
at?" said Brewer, laughing. "You've 
got too much imagination, Joe. You 
belong in the carny business."' 

In a curiously sharp tone, Betta 
said, "Oh, no, Joe's strictly a spacehopper." 

I was, " said Chattan. "Lord 
knows what I am now. That'll be up 
to Spaceman's Hall, when we land."

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



"Well," said Brewer, "we can 
all swear to what happened. You 
won't have any trouble." 

Chattan said, "I hope not," 
rather gloomily. 

T) ETTA SCRATCHED two more 
-•-'names off the itinerary sheet, 
and Brewer howled. They began 
to wrangle again. Chattan looked 
at Lugach, at the silvery spiderweb of lines on his dark skin. They 
were like tattooing, and yet not 
like it. They were like the scars of 
old, thin wounds, and yet not like 
them. They were like writing, like 

intricate design, like well, 

like almost anything you wanted 
to make of them. His mind reverted 
to the Heartworld legend. 

Lugach sat and looked at his 
hands. 

Chattan sighed. Old tales. Dreams 
and moonshine. Nothing. 

And yet the Earthman had tried 
twice to capture Lugach. He probably would try again. 

Well, thought Chattan, there's a 
simple answer to that. The Earthman is crazy. It showed in his face, 
all right. Man with a bee in his 
bonnet. Whatever he thinks or believes about Lugach, it doesn't 
have to be so. 

Forget it. 

It was easy to forget things. He 
was still weak as a kitten, and all 
he had to do was close his eyes. 
The voices of Betta Brewer and 



her father receded into a comfortable distance, blending themselves 
with the background noises of the 
Merry Andrew, the throb of the 
generators, small iron creakings, 
whines, and clatterings from the 
ship itself. 

The few animals belonging to 
the show lived in the central hold, 
and their somnolent gruntings and 
occasional statements of resentment or rage came muffled through 
the ventilator shafts. The* human 
members rattled around in the 
cabin decks, twenty-two adults in 
all, including cook and helper, 
animal man and helper, roustabouts, 
and performers, but not including 
the men who actually piloted and 
served the ship and who bunked on 
the bridge-deck. 

The performers, Chattan had 
noticed, all seemed to be very 
young ones on their way up, or 
worn-out ones on their way down, 
or middle-aged ones who had accepted the fact that they were not 
going anywhere. They had transformed the cabin decks into a 
species of bustling tenement, complete with children of all ages and 
colors, and the corridors resounded 
with voices and the thumping of 
feet, and several different kinds 
of music. 

It probably wasn't a bad life, 
Chattan thought drowsily, if you 
had no ambition and didn't care 
if you were broke. But he washed 



THE TATTOOED MAN

he were back on the Phoebus, he 
wished he were in his old bunk 
.right now, sleeping . , 

Someone screamed, a knife-edged, 
nerve-slashing shriek of sheer 
panic. 

Chattan sat bolt upright, so 
sharply that he pulled his side and 
almost fainted from the pain. Betta 
had sprung up, too, and her face 
was pale. Doc Brewer was swearing 
looking in mingled anger and 
apprehension toward the door to 
the main corridor. 

"What," said Chattan shakily, 
."the hell was "that?" 
. "I'm afraid it's Preek," said 
Betta. 

"Preek?" Chattan had met 
Preek, a plump butter-colored little 
Mintakan who did a mind-reading 
act, and was always as cheerful and 
indolent as a well-fed baby. He 
got lip painfully and started toward the door. "We'd better see 
what's happened to him. Maybe 
one of the animals - -" 

"No," said Betta. "It isn't as 
nice and simple as that. I wish 
it were. Preek's a .genuine sensitive." ■ 

"Most of his people are," said 
Chattan, still prodded by the terror in that scream. "I don't see 
what that's got to do with it." He 
continued toward the door. 

Feet came running down the corridor, small heavy feet moving 
fast. Preek burst in through the 



door. His golden skin was greyish 
and his curly brown hair clung to 
his head, damp with sweat. His 
eyes, normally sleepy and rather 
vague, were as wide and dark and 
shining as the eyes of a frightened 
deer. 

He stopped just inside the door, 
looking from one to the other, half 
seeing, half blind. 

"A shadow passed over the ship," 
he said. "Evil and hate went by 
us, there!" His arm described an 
arc, indicating the passage of 
something which was now ahead of 
the Merry Andrew. Then he shivered, and his voice sank to a childish whimper. "I can smell death," 
he said. "Betta, I'm afraid." 

He went to her and she put her 
arms around him. "There, there," 
she said, but her face was anxious. 

Without warning, the idiot rose 
from his corner and stood up. His 
eyes burned with a great light. He 
clenched his fists and cried out in 
a loud voice. 

"Lugach," he said. "Lugach!" 

"Good God," said Doc Brewer, 
astonished, "he said his name!" 

CHAPTER III 

THE CARNIVAL PITCH on 
Sirius Five was an acre or so 
of flat dusty ground adjacent to a 
corner of the starport. The city 
beyond was indistinguishable from 
the city on Rigel Two. The same 



i8 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



lofty buildings rose in the distance, 
glittering in the overpowering blaze 
of the mighty sun, monuments of 
interstellar trade erected at "this 
contact point. Between the lofty 
buildings and the port the same kind 
of squalid slum spread over the 
land, a less lovely monument to 
interstellar relations. 

Chattan stood blinking in the 
relentless glare, watching the roustabouts haul out. the light plastic 
shelters, brilliantly colored and considerably patched. By a lower 
hatch, the animal man was superintending the unloading of various 
cages. Chattan said, 

"It seems peaceful enough." 

"I hope it stays that way," said 
Betta. "But Preek just isn't ever 
wrong." 

Doc Brewer grunted. "I'm going 
to get rid of that little curse. I'm 
sick, and tired of having my sleep 
ruined by his crepe-hanging. A 
man gets enough trouble without 
having to worry about it ahead of 
time." 

"When are you going to fire 
him?" asked Betta. 

"Well," said Doc. "Sometime. 
Soon. When I can find an act to 
replace him." He went off to 
oversee the setting-up, and Betta 
grinned. 

"The heck he, will," she said. 
"Dad never fires anybody, and if 
they leave him he's blue for days." 
She shook her head. "Poor Dad. 



He's no doggone good, and I know 
it, but what are you going to do?" 

She turned to look at Chattan. 
"I suppose you'll be going back 
to your ship." 

"I suppose, so." 

"Then I suppose this is goodbye." 

"Oh, no," he said quickly. "I'll 
be back." He reached out and 
caught her hand. "Listen, Betta. 
I want to thank you for all you 
did - - -" 

She drew her hand away. "It 
was no more than I'd have done 
for anybody that was hurt." 

"No," said Chattan. "I suppose , 

not. But thanks anyway. And " 

He stepped forward and put his 
arms around her and kissed heiy 
hard. "That's no more than I'd do 
for anyone who saved my life." 

"Then," she said, in an odd, 
quiet voice, "you better do the same 
for Lugach." She withdrew from 
him, and smiled, and said, "Good 
luck, Joe, let us know how you come 
out." 

Rather stiffly, Chattan said, "I 
will. Well, so long." 

He turned and walked away from 
the Merry Andrew. Lugach was inside, as a safety measure, and 
locked up to prevent his wandering or being lured away. After his 

dramatic statement of his name 

the first word Doc or Betta had 
ever heard him speak — he had 
lapsed back into his brooding 
silence. 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



19 



Chattan stamped angrily through 
the dry blazing heat and the dry 
white dust. He did not understand why he should be angry. It 
just seemed that Betta might have 

been a little more well, 

friendly. 

At the edge of the pitch he met 
Preek, who was helping to put up 
the fight collapsible boundary 
fence. In a small outfit like Doc 
Brewer's everybody had to help 
with the work of setting up and 
tearing down, and there were two 
others with him, Shemsi the physical superman from one of the heavy 
worlds of Betelgeuse, and Lute the 
Capellan, a small furry individual 
from aroboreal habitat who did 
incredible things on the high trapeze. They all stopped what they 
were doing, and Preek looked at 
Chattan, and then he turned and 
looked toward the city. And he 
said, 

"The sun does not shine on 
you, Joe, and when I turn toward 
the city I see a red shimmering of 
danger." 

Shemsi said, "Preek knows. You 
better not go." And Lute nodded 
solemnly, his eyes shining like 
emeralds in the silky pale hair 
that covered his face. 

"But I have to," Chattan said, 
half annoyed at Preek, half upset 
in spite of himself. The Mintakans were, as Betta said, genuine 
sensitives, and there was nothing 



supernatural about an esper picking up strong vibrations of malice, 
from the minds of other men. 

It was perfectly possible that 
the thin-faced Earthman had got 
here ahead of them in a faster 
ship. A check with port authority 
on Rigel Two would give him the 
Merry Andrew's destination, and if 
he was still after Lugach he would 
certainly come to Sirius Five. 

It was also perfectly possible that 
•he knew by now that Joe Chattan 's 
body had not been found, and that 
therefore Joe Chattan was very 
likely not dead. He might deduce 
that Chattan was also aboard the 
Merry Andrew, and he might decide to do something about that, 
too. 

Still Chattan had to go into the 
city. If he didn't report himself 
now to Spaceman's Hall and get 
himself straightened out, he would 
never get another berth on a decent 
ship, let alone a master's ticket. 

So he nodded to Preek and the 
others and said, "Thanks anyway 
for the warning." and walked on 
into the hot crowded streets of the 
city. 

"JV/rONEY WAS MADE in the 
-'•'-•■high serene towers, and great 
decisions were carried out that 
affected whole sectors of the galaxy, 
but it was here in the swarming 
starport quarter that life was lived, 
noisily, actively, and with no little 



20 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



violence. 

Men and women of every color in 
the human spectrum, dressed in 
every conceivable costume, moved 
like a sort of sticky kaleidoscope along the streets and around 
the market squares and in and out 
of the bars, tenements and gambling houses. They were the poor of 
the galaxy, the deserving poor 
looking for a better break, the undeserving getting rich on dishonesty and vice, the merely incompetent settling like the blown dust 
into the puddle where chance had 
put them. Mingled with them, but 
not of them, were the men from 
the starships, living it up to last 
them until the next worldfall. 

It was all familiar to Chattan. 
He had been here before, and he 
had been in a hundred other places 
just like it. It should not have been 
disturbing, or menacing. 

It was. The glare of Sirius blinded 
him in the open street, but under 
the walls and in the covered ways 
the shadows were black and full 
of whispers and unseen movement. 
It was hot, and he sweated, but 
the sweat turned cold on his skin. 
The babel of voices, raucous cries, 
music, colors, smells, the swirling 
pushing movement of crowds, all 
confused him, and he felt that under 
cover of these distracting things he 
was being followed, watched, threatened. 

He cursed Preek. He stiffened 



his back and walked steadily, neither slow nor fast. Once or twice he 
yielded to temptation and looked 
behind him, but he could not see 
anything in particular. About 
halfway to the Hall his new-healed 
wound began to ache and a great 
weakness came over him. I'm not 
able to do it today, he thought, 
I'll go back to the ship and rest 
until tomorrow. Then he thought 
angrily, Bull! I'm just looking for 
an excuse to duck, and I'm damned 
if I will. He walked on, his jaw set 
grimly. 

Nothing happened. 

Spaceman's Hall was a typically 
shabby building crowded in between a house of joy and a povertystricken importing firm. Everywhere there was a starport there 
was a Hall, adjunct of the Interstellar Spacemen's Federation, 
where a member in good standing 
could apply for a job or iron out a 
grievance, or try and explain why 
his ship had taken off without him. 

Chattan went inside, into a 
narrow longitudinal hall with several 
doors. The doors had signs over 
them. About midway down was one 
that said SECTION 6, and under 
it "M. Quard". Section 6 of the 
Federation's Standard Contract 
covered violations of the type 
Chattan was concerned with. He 
opened the door and went in. 

Quard was a Sirian, a large 
dark man behind a cluttered desk. 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



21 



There were two other men with 
him. They looked up as Chattan 
entered, and they smiled. They were 
both Earthmen. Chattan knew 
them. He had seen them once before, by moonlight, in an alley on 
Rigel Five. / 
Chattan stopped. The two Earthmen got up, and Quard said to them, 
"Is this the man?". 
• One of the Earthmen looked at 
a photograph attached to some 
papers he held in his hand. He 
looked at Chattan, and said, "Yes." 

Quard said, "Chattan? These 
men have a warrant for your arrest." 

Chattan took a step forward. 
"Arrest!" he said. "That's good, 
coming from them. Look, those are 
my papers they stole from me, after 
their pal shot me and left me for 
dead." He leaned over Quard's 
desk. "How can they arrest anybody? They're not cops, they're 

"But they are," said Quard, 
cutting him short, "I've already 
checked into that, very carefully." 

Chattan looked from him to the 
Earthmen. "I don't .believe it," he 
said, and measured, desperately, the 
distance between himself and the 
door. 

pvNE OF THE MEN had now 
^ moved and placed himself 
between Chattan and the exit. The 
other shrugged and produced credentials. 



"I'm Barbour," he said, "and 
my partner is VanFleet, Earth 
Planetary Police, Detached Unit, 
on special duty with Interstellar 
Research, empowered to make 
arrests under Interstellar Code regulations covering the rights of nationals. Here's the warrant." 

Chattan read it. It authorized 
the arrest of Joseph Henry Chattan, 
a national of Sol Three, for assault 
with intent to commit great bodily 
harm upon the person of Laurence 
Emmett Harvey, also a national 
of Sol Three. Details of the assault followed, sworn to by Laurence Emmett Harvey, and by 
officers Barbour and VanFleet, 
who had accompanied Harvey as 
his bodyguard. The details were 
all there, except one. 

"You forgot," said Chattan, feeling the sweat run down his back, 
"the most important thing of all. 
You forgot Lugach." 

Barbour said, in a tone of mild 
puzzlement, "Lugach? What's 
that?" 

Chattan turned again to Quard. 
"There're lying," he said desperately. "This Harvey thought he'd 
killed me, but he didn't quite, so 
now he's taking this way to shut 
me up. He and these two so-called 
officers were beating up one man in 
an alley, a poor devil of an idiot 
who -couldn't defend himself — " 

"An idiot?" said Quard, frowning. "What are you talking about?" 



22 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



"A freak from a little carnival. 
They'd lured him away, and these 
two beat him down and held him 
while the other man, Harvey, tried 
to force him to talk." 

Barbour laughed. "Well," he 
said, "that's one for the books." 

VanFleet laughed too. "Mr. 
Harvey collects a lot of things, 
but carnival freaks just aren't on 
the list. I'm afraid you were seeing 
things that night, Chattan. You were 
blind drunk. Crazy drunk, I should 
say." 
Chattan said to Quard, "I have 
witnesses." 

"Present them in court," said 
VanFleet. He laughed again. "But 
you're going to have a hard time 
making any judge 'believe that 
Laurence Harvey goes around 
beating up carnival freaks." 

Now, through the reactions of 
fear and frustration that were clouding Chattan's mind, that name 

Laurence Harvey linked it
self with the name of Interstellar 
Research, and rushed suddenly into 
center focus. Interstellar Research, 
biggest of the giant commercialized 
research corporations that bulked 
so large in a galaxy dominated by 
technics. Chattan swore under his 
breath, feeling the imponderable 
weight of millions of dollars and 
the power they can buy descending 
on his head. 

"So that's who it was," he said. 
"Laurence Harvey. One of the 



three directors of Interstellar. No 
wonder he didn't want to be recognized." 

Barbour and VanFleet closed in. 
"Come along, Chattan." 
Chattan sprang. 

He drove his fist hard into Barbour's face, feeling the flesh splay 
out like soft rubber under his 
knuckles. Barbour fell aside, and 
Chattan caromed into VanFleet. 
VanFleet grappled with him, and 
they danced round and round in a 
sort of wild waltz, Chattan striving to free his arms and hit VanFleet, VanFleet trying to hang on 
and at the same time to hit Chattan. Quard stood up behind the , 
desk and shouted at them, punch- ing buttons. 

Chattan pulled back and landed 
a solid kick in VanFleet's gut. 
VanFleet let go of him and bent 
double, his mouth open. Chattan 
bolted for the door, but Barbour » 
was on his feet again now, with 
blood dribbling out of his nose 
and a grin of pure fury on his 
face. He had pulled a gun out 
from under his tunic* 

"Stand still," he said to Chattan, 
"or I'll cut you in two." 

Chattan hesitated. There were 
voices and movement in the hall 
now, men running. VanFleet was 
still struggling for breath. Chattan 
looked at Barbour's gun. 

"You going to kill me here," he 
asked, "in front of witnesses? Mr. 



THE TAT1 

Harvey won't like that." 

"Just stand still," said Barbour. 
He began to walk forward. 

The door burst open. Men came 
in, asking what the trouble was. 
Chattan took the last chance he 
was going to have. He flung himself straight at the group bunched 
up in the doorway. 

There were eight, maybe nine 
men there. Even so, he " almost 
made it, through them and into 
the hall beyond. Almost. Not quite. 
They caught him and held him, 
pinning his arms, and a second 
later he felt the hard little snout 
of a gun rammed into his spine, 
and Barbour's voice said, "I told 
you to stand still." 

He stood still. There was nothing else to do. 

CHAPTER IV 

npIME HAD PASSED. Chattan 
' knew that because the lopsided 
patch of sunlight from the high 
window had moved all the way 
across the opposite wall and was 
now disappearing altogether. The 
room was getting dusky, so that 
the figures of the three men looked 
shadowy and enormous. 

Harvey, VanFleet, and Barbour. 
Barbour, VanFleet, and Harvey, 
Shuffle and reshuffle. Play it hard, 
play it soft. Play it anyway, and it 
still added up two angry men and 
hungry one. Chattan shook his 



OED MAN 23 

head and blinked, and tried to see 
clearly «■ the face of Laurence 
Harvey. 

It was Harvey's turn again, and 
he was playing it soft. 

"You didn't understand that 
night," he said, "and I don't blame 
you. It looked bad, what we were 
doing.' Of course it did. And I 
made things worse, I- admit. I 
shouldn't have shot you. But my 
nerves aren't good, Chattan, not 
at any time. I panicked. I thank 
God I didn't kill you, and I'll 
make it up to you any way I can 
- - rmoney, a job, anything you 
want. Now is that fair?" 

Chattan said, "Just let me go. 
That's all I want." 

"Later," said Harvey. "This 
isn't settled yet. It's important that 
you understand- - -" 

"I understand," said Chattan. 
He spoke with some difficulty 
because his lips were cut and 
swollen. "You're crazy. You've got 
money enough to go ahead and be 
crazy, and nobody cares. You can 
buy guys like Barbour and VanFleet, by the dozen if you want 'em. 
What do they care if you're 
crazy?" 

"But I can't buy you. Is that 
it?" asked Harvey, and smiled. 
"All right, I'll accept that. It isn't 
true that every man has his price, 
no matter what they say. Then 
I'll have to get at you another 
way."

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



He leaned over Chattah in the 
gathering dusk, his pale thin face 
alert and quivering, his eyes 
bright with that look of austere 
and ruthless passion that Chattan 
remembered so clearly. Instinctively Chattan pulled back, but 
the chair stopped him. He was 
tied to it, so there was nothing he 
could do but look up at Harvey, 
and listen. 

"I'm a very rich man, Chattan, 
and the resources of Interstellar 
Research are practically unlimited. 
Between them I've been able to do 
a great deal of studying all over 
the galaxy. The more I did the 
more I came to believe that a legend like the story of the Heartworld couldn't have risen out of 
nothing. Other people have thought 
that, but they didn't have the 
money to carry through. I did." 

He moved away, walking back 
and forth, his feet making a dry 
clacking sound on the floor tiles. 
The shadows grew thicker in the 
corners of the room, and the sounds 
of the city were far off beyond the 
window. VanFleet and Barbour 
waited, resting. Their turn would 
come again. 

Harvey said, "You think I'm 
crazy. I won't argue that. You 
think I've become a fanatic on 
this thing, and I won't argue that, 
either. You laugh out loud when 
I tell you that the man you call 
Lugach knows where the Heart


world is, and 1 1 don't blame you 
for laughing. But you may find it 
less laughable when I tell you that 
his name is not Lugach, that T 
know him, know who he is, studied 
under him and with him on his 
own world, and sent him out eight 
years ago on an expedition to 
prove my theory about the location 
of the Heartworld." 

He swung around, thrusting his 
face close to Chattan's again, 
speaking now with a cold furious 
violence that was shocking to a 
man tied down and unable to fight. 

"The Heartworld had many 
names in legend. Trace them back, 
and as the forms of the legend get 
older the names get older. The 
oldest ones are Lludoc, Lukah, 
Hludag. Does that suggest anything 
to you?" 

Chattan closed his eyes to shut 
out that face so close to his own'. 
The eyes were hypnotic, compelling belief by the sheer force of 
their own belief. 

"It suggests to me that you're 
willing to accept anything to prove 
your theory," Chattan safd. "Maybe you sent an expedition out, 
maybe you didn't. I don't know, 
and I don't care. Maybe Lugach 
is the man you sent, or maybe 
you just think he is. I don't know 
that, either. All I know is you've 
got no right to steal him, or abuse 
him. And if you were telling the 
truth, seems like you wouldn't do 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



2.5 



those things. You'd identify the 
man, return him to his family, be 
honest about it." 

"And let everybody know the 
story? Let every greedy fool in the 
galaxy go hunting for the Heartworld and perhaps even find it, 
before I know myself where it is? 
Oh no. No. You haven't any idea 
what's involved, Chattan. It isn't 
merely the tracking down of a 
legend. Think what , scientific 
knowledge our .forefathers must 
have had, to tame a galaxy! 
Think what we could learn- - -" 

"For the benefit of Intersteller 
Research?" asked Chattan, and 
Harvey laughed. 

"Naturally. Inevitably. Suppose 
you found the Heartworld, Chattan, with all that treasure of knowledge. What could you do with it?" 
"Give it to the galaxy." 
"Yes," said Harvey patiently, 
"but how? Through whom, through 
what ' agency? How would you 
study it, how would you safeguard it, how would you keep out 
the dishonest and the ignorant?" 

"I don't know," said; Chattan 
stubbornly, "but I am not going 
to help you steal Lugach away 
from the carnival." 

TTARVEY'S MOUTH tightened 
into a thin straight line. Chattan was beginning to know that 
look too. 

"The man belongs to me," said 



Harvey quietly'. "That which is 
written on his body belongs to me, 
and only I can read it. Listen to 
me carefully, Chattan, once more. 
I will dismiss the charge against 
you. I will pay you any sum you 
may ask, within reason, and I will 
see to it that you have a life-long 
job in my organization. And all 
you have to do in return is to get 
the man you call Lugach away 
from the carnival and bring him 
to me. He trusts you. It shouldn't 
be hard." 

"No," said Chattan, "just impossible. Like you said, he trusts 
me. So do the others. So go to 
hell." 

"The man needs medical attention," said Harvey, his voice 
now almost inaudible. "Do you 
want him to remain an idiot, a 
hapless freak for fools to gawk at? 
I can give him the best doctors, the 
best psychiatrists. I can cure, 
him." 

"The kind of treatment you 
• were giving him in the alley he 
can do without," said Chattan. 
"And anyway, I don't believe a 
word of this stuff. You're the one 
needs the psychiatrists, Harvey." 

Harvey reached out and struck 
Chattan with his open hand, back 
and forth. 

"You're not very bright," he said. 
"You haven't grasped the situation 
at all. You talk as though you 
had a choice."

He turned away, and Barbour 
and VanFleet stepped in. It was 
their turn again. 

Play it rough. Barbour with the 
swollen nose, VanFleet with the 
sore gut. Play it rough, and love 
it. ■ 

"We can boost the charge 
against you. It's felonious assault 
now, but we can swear to anything. We can make it attempted 
murder. We can put you where 
you'll never see sunlight again as 
long as you live." 

Punctuation marks, shaped with 
fists. Walls, floor, ceiling, bare and 
whirling with unsteady pace. 
Blood, salt-sweet in his mouth, 
hot and wet running down his 
chin, out of his nose, from around 
his eyes. 

"What do you care about that 
idiot? What does he mean to you, 
why are you so hot to protect 
him? Do you know ' something 
about him, Chattan? Something 
you're not telling? A clue to the 
Heartworld? Has he talked? 
What's behind you, Chattan? 
Who's behind you?" 

"Didn't you hear? He can't be 
bought. He's noble, that's all. He's 
not dirty, like us." 

One of them, somebody, hit him 
in the side. Chattan screamed and 
darkness flowed over him, wrapping him, hiding him. He wanted it 
to stay dark, but then a light came, 
a pitiless light to strip him naked 



and show everybody where he was. 
He opened his eyes again. A battery 
lamp glared from the floor, throwing humped black shadows high 
against the walls, up onto the ceiling, across the high window. Looking up, Chattan thought he saw a 
face peering through the window, 
but he knew it was only his imagination because it vanished when 
he looked straight at it. 

Harvey's turn again. 

"Why not be sensible, Chattan? 
If you're telling the truth, if you 
really have no interest in this man, 
except for his welfare, why stand 
in his way and in your own? Prison 
for you, a life of mental darkness 
for him- - -" 

Chattan tried to speak, and 
couldn't, and shook his head. 

Barbour lifted his head up 
almost affectionately, and smiled, 
and said, "And it's all for nothing, 
anyway, because we'll get him. 
With you of without you, we'll 
get him." 

"I wouldn't help you bastards 
get hold of a yellow cur pup," 
Chattan mumbled, arid tried to 
bite the wrist of the hand that was 
holding him. 

The single flimsy door into the 
room exploded inward without 
warning. A very tall, broad man 
rushed through it and caught Barbour up like a small boy in his 
enormous hands and flung him 
bodily into VanFleet. At almost 



THE TATTOOED MAN

the same instant a small and agile 
form covered with bright fur 
sprang down from the high window and settled on Harvey's shoulders and rode him shrieking to the 
floor. Chattan stared at them. 
Shemsi and Lute, he thought, from 
the Merry Andrew, but of course 
that isn't possible and I'm dreaming- - 
Shemsi's great white arms, 
columns of steel and marble, 
crashed down upon the heads of 
Barbour and VanFleet, crash, 
crash, and their faces went slack 
and their bodies limp. Lute, clinging to the writhing, wild-eyed 
Harvey, cried out something about 
a gun, and Shemsi went over and 
hit Harvey on the head, and it 
was- suddenly very quiet and 
peaceful in the room. Preek came 
in and began to cut Chattan loose 
from the chair. 

Chattan stared at them," still 
not believing. How beautifully it 
all fits, he thought. Preek the sensitive, he found out where I was 
through ESP, and brought the 
others to help. How clever you can 
be in dreams. The black shadows 
danced on the walls and the ceiling, and he felt cold and tired. 
Someone was shaking him. 
"Please," he said. "Please let me 
sleep a while." 

Somebody jammed a flask into 
his mouth and poured drops of 
liquid fire down his throat. He 



came to again in a hurry. Preek 
said. "Take a little more, that's it. 
Now we've got to go. Stand up." 

Chattan stood. Shemsi and Lute 
came from where they had been 
tying up Harvey and the others. 
Shemsi put his arm around Chattan. "They'll keep for a little 
while," he said, "with any luck. 
But they're going to be awfully 
mad when they do wake up." 

They started out of the room, 
with Chattan wobbling in the grip 
of Shemsi's arm. 

"They're cops," he said. "Real 
cops. They're bought, but nobody 
knows that but the three of them. 
They can make trouble for you." 

"We know it," Preek said. 

"That was Laurence Harvey," 
Chattan said, staggering down a 
long dusty hall. "Interstellar Research. Rich. Crazy. He'll- - - -" 

"Make trouble," Preek said. "We 
know. I'm a sensitive, remember? 
Save your breath, and hurry.'! 

"Ought to let me go," Chattan 
said. "If I'm not with the carnival, they - - -" 

Shemsi shook him gently. 
'^Didn't you hear? Preek said shut 
up." 

Lute peered out the front door 
and nodded. They went out into 
the night. 

THE HOUSE TO WHICH 
Harvey had brought Chattan stood in an isolated and un


28 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



tenanted little clump of structures 
due, according to signs, to be razed 
for the construction of a new warehouse — a chemical warehouse, 
belonging significantly to Interstellar Research. They went away 
from there as fast as they could, 
through a tangle of dark alleyways betweeen warehouses already 
built. 

"Betta's waiting," Preek said, 
as they ran. "She hired a ground 
car, and we got as close as we 
dared - - - There it is." 

A battered rental-agency vehicle, 
without lights, showed dimly under 
the shadow of a wall. Betta got 
out of it. She was wearing some 
kind of a wrap, and underneath it 
there was a glint of bangles and 
bare flesh. She must have left the 
pitch without changing her costume. 
"Did you get him?" she said. 
"Good. Good. All right, let's go." 

They fairly flung themselves into 
the car, and Preek took the controls. "I can go faster," he said. 
"I can see what's around the 
corners." 

He drove, making the streets 
spin behind them, a broken pattern of dark and light, empty and 
crowded, noisy and still. Scraps 
©f music and laughter clung to 
them briefly, then dropped away. 
Chattan looked at the back of 
Betta's head. 

"Thanks," he said. "But I 
don't see why " 



"Preek couldn't stand it any 
longer," she said. "He could feel 
them beating you, and you were 
holding out in spite of it, and, it 
seemed like the only thing to do." 

Preek giggled suddenly. "That's 
only part of the truth. Why don't 
you tell the rest of it?" 

"Just tend to your driving," 
Betta said. 

Chattan's head had cleared 
enough that he could think a little. 
And he did not like the shape of 
his first thought, at all. 

"You're in trouble," he told 

Betta. "Shemsi — Lute the 

whole carnival. You took a prisoner 
away from authorized police, and 
tied them up. Harvey will crucify 
you for this." 

Betta nodded, without turning. 
"I expect he'll try." 

"Oh, damn it, Betta, you didn't 
have to all go out on a limb for 
me," said Chattan. "Harvey's 
crazy, but he's powerful, and — " 

She turned around, at that. 
"Listen, Joe. You were the one 

who went out on that limb 

for Lugach. What w*re we supposed to do — leave you out 
there?" 

Preek went around another 
corner fast, and Chattan reminded 
himself never to ride with an esper 
driver again. They went past the 
soaring starport lights and towers, 
and then the small, tinselly, gaudy 
patch of lights that was the carnival 



THE TATTOOED MAN

came Into view. 

Business appeared to be good. 
Doc Brewer had a happy look 
about him as he came to meet 
them, hut it was a slightly irritated 
look too. 

"Listen," he started in, "don't 
you know better than to run out 

between shows and " Then he 

stared. "Why Joe Chattan. What 
the hell happened to your face?" 

Chattan brushed that aside. 
"I'll explain that later. I. don't 
think we've got too much time." 

"Come in the office-wagon," 
Betta said. "I've got a first-aid 
kit there. Might as well fix your 
face while we talk." 

In the crowded little wagon, 
they talked, and as they talked 
Doc Brewer's happy look left him. 

"Harvey, of Interstellar Research? And he saw Shemsi and 
Lute and Preek? Then we're 
sunk," he said dismally. 

"Would you rather I'd left Joe 
there?" Betta asked. 

,Brewer exploded. "Hell, no! If 
I'd known what was up I'd have 
•gone with you for him. But what 
are we going to do now? Those 
three won't stay tied up forever." 

"By morning, they'll be yelling 
for the Port Police," Chattan said. 
"As for what you're going to do, 
there're two things you can do. 
You can give Lugach to Harvey. 
I'm pretty sure that'd smooth over 
' everything." 



He thought for a moment that 
Doc Brewer was going to hit him. 
"Give poor witless Lugach to that 
bastard? Why - - -" Then he stopped, and said, "What's the other 
thing we can do?" 

Chattan had been thinking. His 
mind was not too clear yet but he 
had at least got hold of one idea, 
and it came from the words that 
had passed between him and Harvey 
in that room. 

He, said, "You can load up the 
show and pull out of here right 
now, tonight." 

"Pull out for where? A man 
with Harvey's influence can run 
us down and have us arrested anywhere we go!" 

Chattan said, "You told me that 
the captain who sold you Lugach 
found him on Algol One. Do you 
know just where he got him there?" 

"Sure," said Doc Brewer, "he 
bought him from one of those 
plunder-merchants there, a man 
named Farah He stopped 

suddenly, and looked shocked. "Yov 
don't mean, go there?" 

"Their warrants wouldn't run at 
Thieves' Star," Chattan reminded. 
"It'd give us time. The way I see 
it, Lugach is the key. Find out who 
Lugach really is, why Harvey 
really wants him, and I'm betting 
we'll uncover enough to tear Harvey 
wide open and clear ourselves. He 
sure isn't after Lugach because he 
believes in the Old Heartworld

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



myth!" > ^ 

Brewer looked thoughtful. 
"Thieves' Star is a tough place to 
tackle, especially with our money 
running out. But you're right, 
they couldn't arrest us there." A 
speculative gleam came into his 
eye. "And if Lugach is that valuable to Harvey, it ought to be 
valuable to us to go there and find 
out why.?' 

Preek spoke up unexpectedly. 
"You are wrong about one thing, 
Joe." 

"I am? What?" 

"Harvey does believe that Lugach 
is the key to the Heartworld. He 
ibelieves in the Heartworld, utterly. 
In his mind, I read it." 

Chattan was astounded. "Oh, 
no, you must have been wrong, 
Preek. He's too clever to chase 
•myths." 

"He believes," said Preek. 

They stared at each other. Doc 
Brewer mopped his suddenly damp 
brow, and said, 

"What the devil have I got into, 
anywayf The Heartworld, is it? 
We'd better get out of here, and 
we'd better get damned fast!" 

CHAPTER V 

npHE MERRY ANDREW 
A raced cluimsy and creaking, 
toward Algol. Its clearance papers, 
hastily made out with the Port 
Authority on Sirius Five, gave 



Canopus as its destination, but then 
nobody who was headed for the 
Thieves' Star ever admitted it. 

Algol was a curiously anomaly 
in those days of Galactic Federation, and a thorn in the side of 
galactic law -« - a rogue star whose 
worlds had chosen to remain independent, outside the Federation 
and free of any of its codes and 
contracts. They did not recognize 
any law but their own, and they 
laughed at extradiction. The result was that the worlds of Algol 
were probably the richest in the 
galaxy, for the least amount of 
exertion. The loot and plunder of 
a galaxy came here to be sold in 
the biggest thieves' market in history. Countless men, their pockets 
heavy with ill-gotten fortunes, 
came for a healthful change of 
climate. The Algolians smiled, and 
raked in the profits. 

"A devil of a place," complained 
.Doc Brewer, "for practically honest people to be going. It's as good 
as admitting we're guilty of something." 

"Well," said Bgtta crossly," 
"what else could we have done? 
We'd be behind bars now, and we 
could rot there for all Harvey 
cares. At least this way we'll have 
time to try and find out what's 
behind all this." 

"If Harvey doesn't catch up 
with us first," said Brewer. 

"We'll be on even terms with him 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



3i 



if he does," said Chattan. "He 
doesn't have the law at Algol, nor 
his corporation, to back him up." 

"He's still got money," said 
Brewer, "and that's good anywhere." 

Over in the corner Preek swore 
irritably. "How do you expect me 
to do anything with all this babble 
~oing on? This is work for a Class 
One esper in the first place, and 
I'm only a Class Three. Give me a 
break, please.!' 

They fell silent watching 
Preek. Shemsi and Lute were there 
too, and Gurtharn the animal man, 
holding one of his smaller charges 
like an ailing baby in his arms. 
Preek sat in front of Lugach, who 
was in his usual place, in his usual 
attitude of silent brooding. 

"I can't deep-probe him," Preek 
said. " A Class Three is frankly 
just not good enough. But I might 
be able to get something that 
would help us, if I could slip down 
through the top layer of his mind. 
You've no idea what a mess it is — 
cloudy gray, with slashes of color, 
mostly red, and full of outlines 
you can't quite see, like houses in 
a fog." 

"He shook his head. "It feels 
different, though, somehow, from 
the first time." 

I "What first time?" asked Chattan. 

"Well, when Doc brought him 
aboard I took a sort of a fast 



survey of him. I didn't see anything then but fog, and I'm not 

sure I do now, but it seems 

thinner." 

Preek settled his shoulders. His 
eyes got vague and unfocused. At 
first he was quiet, and the room 
was quiet, so that even the sounds 
of breathing seemed loud. Chattan glanced at Betta and she 
smiled nervously and dropped her 
gaze. Lute fidgeted, his small restless body shifting audibly. Gurtharn 
stroked the bug-eyed ball of fur in 
his arms. 

Then Preek began to talk. 
"Gray. Clouds running, coiling. 
Hiding. Warm, full belly, no physical pain, but the red color is fear. 
Behind the cloud is fear, is danger, 
is pain, is dead-living flayed tortured /- - -" 

Preek's face contracted in a grimace of anguish. Sweat gleamed on 
his skin. He sat rigid and did not 
speak again. 

Now Betta looked at Chattan, 
and at Doc Brewer, with increasing 
uneasiness. Lute stopped fidgeting. 
They waited. 

Preek whimpered. His eyes 
closed and he swayed on the chair. 
Chattan half started to his feet. 
And then as though the intrusion of 
Preek's mind into the clouded 
mists of his own had triggered 
some fateful reaction beyond anyone's understanding, Lugach flung 
up his head and looked at something 



32 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



that was not within the iron confines of the room. He looked at 
it as a sane man looks upon a 
recognized and dreadful shape, and 
then he raised his hands as though 
to shield himself, and cowered 

back, and shouted two words, 

three words, then nothing, and his 
mouth froze in the act of screaming. 

Preek fell off the chair. He rolled 
over feebly, shook his head, and 
began to crawl away from Lugach. 
His face, was white. 

Doc Brewer was on his feet. 
"What did he say? What did he 
say?" 

"I don't know what he said," 
Preek muttered, "but I know what 
he was thinking." He fetched up 
against the opposite bulkhead and 
sat there, panting. "I pushed. I 
pushed real hard, to get down past 
the clouds, and I guess I don't 
know enough about this business, 
or I can't control it right, because 
I think I opened up a way for him, 
too." 

"Well, what was it?" demanded Doc Brewer. "What did you 
see?" 

"A star," said Preek. "Green. 
Evil. Deadly. Coming to kill me." 
He got unsteadily to his feet. 
"The hell with that. I'll never go 
in his mind again. I'm just a poor 
little Class Three, and I want to 
live." 

He went out of the room. Betta 



had gone over to Lugach. She was 
standing helplessly beside him, her 
hand poised in mid-air over his 
shoulder. Lugach himself was 
doubled up now, shivering, his 
hands covering his head. 

Chattan, . feeling wretched, as 
though he had witnessed the torturing of an animal, went over to 
Lugach and bent down. He put his 
hands on the dark shoulders with 
the enigmatic silver marks, and 
said, gently, "Lugach. It's all right, 
it's all gone now. You're quite 
safe, Lugach — " 

And suddenly the black anguished 
eyes ..were looking straight into 
his, and the tattooed hands were 
making a violent gesture of negation. 

"Lugach," he said, -two or three 
times, coupled with unintelligible 
words. He spoke urgently, as though 
it was imperative that Chattan 
understand, saying Lugach and 
then the words in whatever language was native to him, possibly 
the same language in which Harvey 
had spoken to him in the alley. 
Chattan said, "I'rrusorry, I don't 
understand. Lugach — ?" 

npHE DARK MAN THUMPED 
-*■ himself on the chest and said, 
"Shoba Ruk! Shoba Ruk!", and 
for a moment Chattan felt like a 
small boy reprimanded for his 
stupidity. He said in Universal, 
"Your name is Shoba Ruk." 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



33 



And in clear, perfectly articulated 
Universal, the dark man said, "Yes, 
that is my name, Lugach is danger 
great danger if I die someone 
should know. Someone should know. 
Not Laurence." He leaned toward 
Chattan. "Not Laurence. That 
would be folly as great as theirs. 
Help me to to tell- - -" 

"Oh, Lord," said Chattan, "he's 
slipping away again." He caught 
Shoba Ruk and shook him. "Tell 
what? What do you want? I'll 
ielp 

But Shoba Ruk slipped, quite 
literally, out of his hands and fell 
on the deck and lay there, breathing heavily, but otherwise still. 

The^ looked at him, and at each 
other. 

"He's fainted," Betta said. "Too 
much of a shock. I hope we haven't 
hurt him. Preek never meant " 

"Do you suppose we better try 
and bring him around?" Brewer 
asked. 

"I think," said Chattan hesitantly, "we'd better just let him alone." 
In spite of his concern for "Lugach, 
or Shoba Ruk, he could not help a 
sense of tremendous excitement. 

"He did speak though really 

speak. That proves he wasn't always an idiot. And he said Laurence. Did you hear?" 

They had. 

"Say it was Laurence Harvey 
he meant," said Doc Brewer. 
"What did he mean? What shouldn't 



Laurence know? And what's all 
that stuff about the green star and 
danger, danger? It sounds cra2y to 
me!" 

Chattan didn't answer that at 
once. He bent over Shoba Ruk and 
said, "Shemsi, will you give me a 
hand? We ought to get him to his 
bunk - -" 

"I'll do it," Shemsi said, and 
picked up the unconscious man as 
though he had no weight at all. 
"We'll take turns to watch by him," 
he said, and went out, with Lute 
tagging after. 

Gurtharn, holding the little 
animal tenderly between his great 
hands, looked after Shoba Ruk and 
said quietly, "I think he's hiding 
from himself, in his own mind. 
When Preek began to wake his 
memory, he was afraid and went 
unconscious. Like this little one, 
when life is too much for him, and 
I find him dead in his cage and 
must comfort him and coax him to 
come alive again." 

The creature narrowed its big 
round eyes and bit him happily on 
the finger, and Gurtharn laughed. 

Chattan came back to Doc 
Brewer. He said, "So it sounded 
crazy to you. I don't think so. I 
think maybe Preek just gave you 
the key to a pot of gold." 

"How so?" 

"The green star. Doesn't it all 
add up? Laurence Harvey, Shoba 
Ruk, expedition, some discovery 



34 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



Harvey is frantic- to get his hands 
on, something Shoba Ruk doesn't 
think he ought to have, something 
at or near a green star. Something valuable." 

Betta caught her breath and 
said, "Do you think it might 
really be the Heartworld?" 

"Harvey believes it. Preek said 
so. That's what he sent Shoba Ruk 
out to find. I'm beginning to think 
we'd better keep at least an open 
mind." 

Doc Brewer swore. "Well," he 
said, "I'm damned. No. No, it isn't 
possible, and I'll tell you why. I've 
billed that son of a gun all over 
the galaxy as the Man from the 
Heartworld, and I've never told 
the truth yet on a billing. It's a 
tradition with me." 

Remembering suddenly something Harvey had said, Chattan 
asked, " Why did you bill him that 
way, Doc? You must have had a 
reason." 

"Sure I did. That tattooing. 
Didn't you ever hear the story, 
about how the real men of the 
Heartworld took to marking their 
hides in a ^special way nobody 
else could duplicate, so they'd be 
known anywhere they went, and so 
nobody could pretend to be one 
that wasn't? I guess that would 
have been after there were plenty 
of colonists around. Anyway, when 

I saw the way Luga I mean, 

Shoba Ruk now, was marked, that 



was the first thing popped into 
my head. I supposed actually some 
tribe way^back on a system you 
never heard of had done it, but 
it seemed like a safe enough lie. 
I never figured it might be the 
truth," 

He thought about it a minute, 
and then he said, "Aw, it can't be. 
I just can't believe it. That fairy 
tale?" 

Betta said, frowning, "We do 
know Shoba Ruk himself isn't 
from the Heartworld. Even if he 
did find it, why would he be tattooed?" 

"I don't know," Chattan admitted. "But Harvey said he could read 
what was written on his skill. Well, 
maybe we can find out more when 
we hit Algol, and maybe Shoba Ruk 
might still be«able to tell us. But I 
■know one thing." 

"What's that?" asked Doc. "As 
if I didn't know." t 

"Shoba Ruk doesn't want 
Laurence to have something, and 
I don't want him to have it either. 
Because* whatever it is Laurence 
is trying to steal it;, and he's scared 
witless that some word of the find 
will leak out before he can do 
that." 

/"^H ATT AN WAS SUDDENLY 

^ beginning to see sense behind 
Harvey's wild behavior. 

"Say it is the Heartworld that 
Shoba Ruk found. That would be

long to the whole galaxy, wouldn't 
it? The Federation government 
would take it over, protect it, administer it, and see to it that any 
scientific secrets found there were 
properly handled. Am I' right?"* 

"Perfectly," said Brewer. 

"Well, then, Harvey's problem 
is simple. If he wants to take all 
that scientific knowledge for himselfj, he's got to get there before 
anyone else knows about it, and before the Federation can step in. 
To do that, he's willing to commit 
any crime from kidnaping to murder, and as long as we've got Shoba 
Ruk we're front and center in the 
firing line." 
■ "So?" 

"So as I see it, the only way to 
save our necks, and incidentally 
keep Harvey from the biggest steal 
in history, is find that green star 
'before he does and then scream to 
the Federation." 

"Yes," said Doc Brewer, smiling 
slowly, "that sounds pretty good. 
It would make us heroes, with 
knobs on. And more important, I 
can think of at least forty ways it 
could make us rich." 

"I'll bet you can," said Betta, 
and shook her head. "I'll buy your 

idea, Joe, but I'll tell you I 

don't think we've got a hope of 
finding that star unless Shoba Ruk 
himself comes to and tells us." 
I He did not. And two days later 
by the ship's chronometer they 



raised the white blaze of Algol and 
edged their way into that triple 
system, leaving the more distant 
sun to starboard and passing well 
above the other half of the eclipsing binary, Algol's "dark" companion that was itself almost as 
bright as their own remembered 
Sol. Presently in that overwhelming sea of radiance they picked up 
a planet glittering like a diamond, 
and settled in for a landing on 
Algol One. 

It was a hot heavy planet, and a 
stormy one. It was pouring a mighty 
rain when the Merry Andrew landed, and the roar of the run-off into 
the underground drains was deafening when the motors stopped. 

"I'll leave it to you," Doc Brewer said to Betta, "to see that the 
show is set up, ready for tonight. 
We're about broke from running out 
on our last pitch, and besides, it'll 
look better if we act normal." He 
stopped and looked into the cabin 
where Shoba Ruk lay in his bunk. 
His eyes were open, but he seemed 
if anything more distant and beyond human communication than 
ever. Shemsi and Lute were there. 

"You watch him," Doc Brewer 
said. "Don't let him go out, and 
don't show him." 

Shemsi nodded. Brewer and Chattan and Preek went on to the lock. 
Chattan, feeling that they might 
need all the help they could get, 
had suggested taking the sensitive 



36

along. 

They climbed down the ladder 
and stood in the roaring, pouringrain. "It'll let up soon," said Brewer. "Come on, let's get on to Farah's." 

Doc led the way off the starport 
and into the city. The rain stopped 
as suddenly as though someone had 
turned off the tap. The double sun 
came out and Chattan gasped with 
the light and heat. Instantly a 
million signs, banners, flags and 
pennants hung Over a million doorways took fire in. an explosion of 
color. They were in the bazaar 
quarter - - - or perhaps more correctly they were in the bazaar that 
was itself a giant city. 

Thieves' bazaar, heaped with the 
loot of a galaxy, and not one item 
there honestly come by. Chattan 
had heard all about it from spacemen, but now that he saw it he 
didn't believe it. The vast rambling 
honeycomb of buildings, in every 
conceivable material from native 
stone to gaudy plastic, held such 
hoards of rare and wonderful 
things that the eye was dazzled by 
the ever-shifting pattern of shape 
and color, the glitter of gems in a 
dark barred window, the richness 
of furs and fabrics from distant 
worlds, objects of art beautiful, 
grotesque, reflecting a million different tastes. Curios, drugs, human 

merchandise everything brought 

a price on Algol One. Chattan knew, 



and was not surprised, that many a 
respectable firm had dealings with 
this thieves' market. 

Doc Brewer stopped at a meeting of four main ways, looking up 
and down. "That's the street of the 
drug-sellers," he said, muttering to 
himself, "and what's down that 

way I don't know, but yes, the 

place we want must be Up ahead." 

He started on again, and Chattan 
said, "For somebody that hasn't 
been here before, you seem to know 
your way pretty well." 

Doc Brewer said uncomfortably, 
"To tell you the truth, I was here 
once, an awful long time ago. I 
wasn't much more than a kid. Ijor 
Pete's sake, don't tell Betta. She 
knows too much about my shortcomings as it is." 

They went a little further, panting and steaming in the heat. Two 
or three times now Brewer stopped 
to ask directions, and presently 
they came into a square roofed 
over against the sun with crimson 
silk. On one side was a broad doorway with a sign that said simply, 
FARAH'S. Inside ft was dark and 
cool and quiet. There were a few 
things around on stands and in 
niches, which even to Chattan's 
uneducated eye were obviously 
treasures. There was nobody in 
sight when they came in, and they 
hesitated, looking around. And suddenly Preek said in a whisper, shivering, 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



37 



"There is someone watching us, 
with the eye of a hunting leopard." 

Hangings parted at the back of 
the room, 'and a man from Fomalhaut, as white and slender and 
raceful as a fine blade, and with 
exactly the eye Preek had mentioned, nodded to them and said, 
"I am Farah." 

Doc Brewer 'began to talk, and 
T arah listened. Chattan tried to 
,atch Farah's face, but the light 
ms too dim to show any shades 
| expression, so he couldn't judge 
hether or not Farah was lying 
hen he said, 

"Off hand I do not remember 
such a man. You're sure your 
"riend bought him from me." 
"He was definite. Yes." 
"Hm. Well, it's possible. So many 
things pass through my hands. A 
attooed man, you say? An idiot? 
T ow long ago? Let me get my records. They will show exactly, all 
the details." 

TpARAH TURNED and went out 
A again, swiftly. Once more they 
tood in the quiet room, uneasy, 
aiting. And once more Preek 
poke, in a hurried undertone. 

"That man is a thief and a liar. 
His mind is a maze — I get lost 

in it. Blood he kills easily, 

» profit, not for pleasure. And 
now - - -" 

"Isn't he getting the records?" 
asked Brewer. 



"Yes, but there are others with 
him. Damn! If I could only see 
more clearly - - - He's sending them 
away, they're going away, and 
Farah's mind is busy reckoning - - -" 

"Reckoning what?" asked Chattan. 

"Money," said Preek. "And bodies. Ours." 

Farah came back with a microbook spool and clipped it into a 
viewer. 

"Now let's see," he said. "It 
would have been about this time - - yes, here it is. Adult male, origin 
unknown, distinguishing marks — 
yes, yes, I remember now." Farah 
smiled. "He had the word Lugach 
tattooed on his hands, and he 
was a complete idiot. I bought him 
as a favor from a friend of mine 
who was hard up, and resold him at 
a fair profit to your friend." 

Very carefully Doc Brewer said, 
"Do you happen to remember 
where your friend got him?" 

Farah seemed honestly to be 
thinking. "Somewhere in space, I 
think. I seem to remember something about a lifeboat 

"Would you," asked Brewer, trying to keep his voice steady, "remember aibout where in space?" 

Farah shook his head. "I'm 
afraid not," he said, and laughed. 
"It hardly seemed important. But, 
if it's important to you, I can try 
to find out. Of course, my time is 



38 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



valuable to me — " 

"We'll be very happy to pay you," 
Brewer said. "It is important to 
us - - - sort of a, uh, personal matter." 

"Give me a day or two, " Farah 
said. "Where can I reach you?" 

Doc Brewer told him, and they 
went out again, into the heat that 
did not seem to be diminishing in 
spite of the lowering sun. 

"What did you think?" asked 
Brewer, and Chattan grunted. 

"That's a man I wouldn't turn 
my back on. Still, he's probably 
telling the truth. How about that, 
Preek?" 

"Truth," said Preek absently. 
"Yes. But let's go that way, 
around the corner." 

Brewer protested, but turned, 
and then at Preek's urging they 
doubled twice more in the maze of 
winding streets. 

"Those men he sent out of his 
place," said Preek finally. "They're 
following us." 

The shadows were long in the 
streets of the thieves' bazaar. 
Overhead the signs and the banners 
I 'blazed in the slanting light. Men 
\ went by, soft-footed, sharp-eyed, " 
and every one of them was potentiI ally an enemy, 
p Chattan said, "Where?" 

"Just around that last corner." 
"Okay," said Chattan. "Doc, 
you walk on, like you're walking 
now, straight ahead. Preek, you 



see that opening there between 
those shops? Right under the 
green banner with the sunburst on 
it. When we get there, you and I 
will turn in." 

"I don't like to separate," Doc 
protested. 

"You won't have to go far, 
Down to the next square, and 
wait." The alley mouth was beside them now, narrow and dark 
between the building walls. . The 
huge banner rustled overhead. 
Chattan and Preek turned into it. 
When they were out of sight of 
the street they ran, over the crooked 
stones, until the uneven line of 
the wall gave them a niche, to hide 
in. There were doors and windows 
unevenly spaced. Lights showed in 
some of them, and somewhere, 
languidly, a woman was singing. 

"Quiet," murmured Preek, pressing nervously against, the wall. "One 
is going on with Doc. The othter's 
turning in." 

The shadows grew thicker in 
the crooked lane. Chattan stood 
still, waiting, his head turned so 
that his cheek- touched the warm, 
crumbling- plaster. 

Footsteps came, light and wary, 
across the stones. 

Chattan shifted his weight, drawing a slow breath. 

A man came into sight, moving 
very cautiously, looking from side 
to side. He saw Chattan at the 
same instant Chattan saw him. He 



THE TATTOOED MAN 

stopped short and his hand flew 
his belt, but Chattan was on him 
before he had time either to draw 
or run. 



39 



CHAPTER VI 

'-pHE MAN WAS LEAN and 
wiry and vicious. He did not 
want to be held. He gave Chattan 
the knuckles of his two fists in a 
double uppercut, and the point of 
one bony knee in the belly. Chattan pulled his head back so the 
doubled fists just grazed his forehead, and the knee he managed to 
slide off onto one hip. He was 
angry, angry at being followed, 
at being pushed around, at being 
made the goat for other people's 
plans, at the whole mess he had 
got into through one simple act of 
mercy. He hit the wiry man. He 
hit him hard. 

"Now, then," he said. "Why are 
you following us?" 

Black eyes glared, dazed and 
furious, out of a brown face. 
Chattan shook him. 
. "Farah sent you. Why?" 

"You ask him. I'm only a hired 
boy,", gasped the wiry man. "He 
doesn't tell me why. Let me go." 

"Not until I find out " 

"Watch it!" said Preek suddenly, 
but it was too late. The wiry man 
had got his breath back and begun 
to yell. 

"Thieves!" he yelled. "Murder! 



Help!" His voice shrilled and echoed from the crowding walls. "Shut 
up," said Chattan fiercely. "Shut 
up!" But the damage was already 
done. Heads appeared in windows 
and doors opened. 

"Let him go," Preek said. "He 
doesn't know, anyway. For godsake, let's get out of here." 

Chattan gave the man a final 
blow to shut his mouth, and then 
he and Preek ran back along the 
alley and into the street again. 
They slowed to a fast walk and 
caught up finally with Doc, who 
was waiting anxiously at the next 
square. Pursuit, if any, was left behind. 

"As near as I could get from his 
mind," Preek said, "he thought we 
were queer people to be dealing 
with Farah, and he figured Farah 
thought so, too. Maybe that's true. 
I suppose we did look a little funny coming in there asking questions about a tattooed* idiot." 

"Is the other one still with us?" 
asked Chattan. 

"Like a mother." 

Chattan comtemplated further 
action, but gave it up. "We wouldn't get any more from him than we 
did from the first one. And I suppose in Farah's line of work it's 
automatic to be suspicious of 
people you don't know. Just the 
same, damn it, I don't like to be 
spied on." 

"Well," said Doc Brewer uneasi


40 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



ry, "I don't either, but I reckon 
we'll have to put up with it until 
tomorrow, anyway. Farah might 
know something by then, and anyway, we won't have money enough 
to buy fuel to get the Merry Andrew off until after the show. Maybe not then, if business isn't good. 
But I guess it might be a wise 
idea to keep guard on Lugach 
every minute." 

They went on back to the ship. 
And night came on slowly, with 
hot winds and a burning radiance 
of stars. 

Betta had done a good job setting up the show. Many-colored 
lights danced in the wind, splashing 
the plastic tents with glimmers of 
green and gold and red. Betta, in 
silver spangles, was doing her comeon - - -an acrobatic sort of dance 
involving rings, bars, and a padded 
platform. She was only moderately 
good at it, but her lithe little 
figure and bright personality 
brought the customers in. After a 
while, when she had them softened 
-up a bit, Shemsi came out and 
tossed her around, gently and with 
spendid ease, so that she looked 
like a silver leaf whirling high 
among the lights. The crowd, half 
tolerant, half openly scornful but 
with a what-the-hell-it's somethingto - do expression, began to buy 
tickets and pass in. Doc Brewer 
held up crossed fingers. 

"It looks like a good night," he 



said in the tone of one too often 
betrayed. 

Chattan agreed that it did. But 
the hot wind ruffled his hair* the 
wrong way and the ground felt 
wrong when he walked on it, and 
all the familiar shapes of ship and 
carnival grounds were somehow 
changed and threatening. Nerves, 
he thought, and strolled back and 
forth, but the feeling didn't leave 
him. He went inside the Merry 
Andrew and checked on Lugach, 
or Shoba Ruk- - -having got used 
to one name, it was hard to change. 
He remembered Laurence Harvey's 
voice saying, The oldest names for 
the Heartworld are Lludoc, Lukah, 
Hludag. Lugach. Was it possible, 
really, that the name tattooed on 
the hands of Shoba Ruk was the 
true name of the lost cradle of 
humankind? 

Shoba Ruk still lay in his bunk. 
Shemsi and Lute were busy with 
their performances, and the cook 
and his helper were standing guard. 

"He's quiet enough," said the 
cook, "but he's been talking. To 
himself. I couldn't make any sense 
of it. Nekru here thought he recognized the language, but he 
wasn't sure, and " 

/CHATTAN SWUNG on the 
^'helper so intently that the man 
was startled. He was a long gray 
lazy man, from one of the nameless 
star systems that dot the hinter


THE TAT1 

lands of the galaxy much as the 
nameless villages filled the hills 
and the wide plains of Earth in 
the old days. The natives had 
names for them, but outside them 
nobody cared. 

"Did you understand it?" Chattan demanded. 

"No, sir," said Nekru. "I only 
said I thought it sounded like the 
way a man I worked with once 
used to talk, and he looked like 
this fellow, too. Only had his wits, 
of course, and he wasn't tattooed. 
But otherwise he looked like him, 
Same color. Not that that means 
anything by itself." 

"No," said Chattan, digging his 
nails into -the palms of his hands, 
"but if they looked alike and spoke 
alike it might mean something. 
Where did this other man come 
from?" 

"Some little star system way 
"ver beyond Eridanus. I can't 

remember the name " 

"Please?" said Chattan. fTry." 
Nekru looked at him, and then 
frowned in an agony of effort. 
"Thir. Thir-something. I think. It 
was a long time ago. Thirban? 
hirbar? Something like that." 
And that was the best he could 
do. Chattan went and leaned over 
he bunk. "Shoba Ruk," he said. 
"Shoba Ruk." 

The eyes of the dark man flick~red. He muttered something in 
is own language. 



OOED MAN 4I 

"I can't understand you, Shoba 
Ruk," said Chattan. "Is your home 
at Thirban?" 

Again the dark man muttered. 
Then he moved his head impatiently and spoke in Universal. "Thirbar, Thirbar. Yes. Now leave me, 
I am very busy." 

Chattan leaned closer. "Shoba 
Ruk- - -where is Lugach?" 

Instantly he was sorry. The long 
gaunt body in the bunk became 
agitated, and the face was convulsed. "Lugach," whispered Shoba 
Ruk, and lifted his hands. "If I 
write it there I will remember someday if I live, the sight in my eyes, 
the sound in my ears repeated. 

Must remember! Danger if " 

He reached up and caught Chattan by the front of his jacket. His 
eyes blazed. 

"Laurence, this power is not for 
one man. I forbid you. You are 
like them, greedy, proud and stupid. 
Old stubborn parents who would 
not "let go the swaddling bands. 
Stupid, stupid, pitiful, and you're 
like them. You must not." 

He let go and sank back, smiling. 
"Anyway, you can't. You have not 
the key of entrance to the vault. 
And the green star kills. I only am 
left alive." 

His eyes closed, and then a minute later he opened them again and 
said testily, "I am busy. These 
things must come in order, don't 
you understand that? Get out. Get 



42 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



out." 

Chattan stepped back from the 
bunk. The cook and Nekru were 
staring, scared but fascinated. Chattan's heart was pounding. 

"Watch hiim," he said. "Every 
minute. And if he says anything 
you can understand, for God's 
sake remember it." 

He ran out of the cabin, out of 
the ship, back to the carnival 
pitch where the red and green and 
yellow lights danced in the hot 
wind, and the good-paying crowd 
pushed among the bright-colored 
booths, and the recorded music 
gave out sounds of brassy cheerfulness. He looked for Doc Brewer, 
and found him in the office wagon, 
counting the take. 

"Pretty good," said Doc. "We 
can buy fuel " 

"I've got something better," 
Chattan said. He told him briefly 
what Shoba Ruk had said. "I think 
he's coming round, back to sanity. 
He's having to do it his own way, 
slowly, remembering things and 
trying to arrange them properly. 
There ought to be someone with 
him now all the time, with a taperecorder to take down everything 
he might say. I think " 

Abruptly, with the suddenness 
of a blow, the lights went out. 

There was a second of absolute 
silence. Then Doc Brewer said, 

"The generator ", and in the 

same moment all over the carnival 



pitch voices rose, dismayed and 
querulous. Chattan jumped down 
from the wagon. The portable 
generator was close by, and he 
started toward it in the dark. To 
his right he could make out the 
curving row of booths and the 
massed yeasty movement of people. 
The music had stopped with the 
lights, and there was no sound but 
the voices and the trampling of 
feet. 

He heard Doc Brewer come out 
of the wagon and go toward the 
booths, calling out that everything 
was all right, just a little generator 
trouble, nothing to worry about. 
Then a woman screamed with the 
sharp insistence of real fear. A 
man's voice took it up with a cry 
of, "Look out!" Then, on top of 
those two voices, smothering and 
crushing them down, an avalanche 
of noise descended - - - howls, 
shouts, the cries of frightened 
animals, the stamping of feet and 
the crashing of falling things, with 
an obligato of female screaming 
above it all. 

Doc Brewer came baok, running. 
He ran into Chattan, saw who it 
was, and pulled him on. "For 
God's sake get the lights back on." 

"What is it, a panic?" 

"It's one now, all right, but it 
sounds like a clem to me." 

"What's that?" 

"Fight. Raid. Where the natives 
come in and wreck you. Hear 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



43 



that?" 

SPLINTERING CRASHES, bellows, sounds of rage and turmoil. Chattan thought he could 
hear Shemsi's great voice. The 
portable generator loomed in the 
night in front of him, housed in its 
own bright plastic hut. It was not 
working. Doc Brewer stumbled 
over something on the ground and 
swore. It was the end of a cable, 
chopped in two. 

"They've all been cut," said 
Chattan. He straightened up in 
sudden alarm. "Christ," he said. 
"Shoba Ruk." 

"Oh lord," said Brewer. "You 

don't think " 

They began to run again, through 
the wind and the hot night, toward 
the Merry Andrew. But Chattan 
did not go all the way. "Let him 
go," he said to Brewer. "The hell 
with him. I'm going to find Betta." 

"She's all right," Brewer said. 
"She knows what to do. She's been 
through these before." 

But Chattan left him and plunged into the locked, swaying, struggling mass of people among the 
booths. Little herds of them broke 
loose and ran this way and that, 
knocking things over, trampling 
each other into the dust. There 
were moans and curses. Chattan 
saw the dim outlines of people in 
spangled costumes trying to lead 
patrons off the grounds. And now 



he saw others, Shemsi among them 
distinguishable by his great height, 
fighting savagely with a knot of 
men who were armed with clubs 
and bars. Chattan pushed and 
butted and kicked his way to the 
central hub of conflict. It too was 
moving, lurching back and forth as 
the tide of battle and the outward 
pressures of the crowd moved it. 
Betta's ring-and-bar set-up were 
wrecked, but the platform still 
stood firm. 

Chattan shouted to Shemsi, 
"Where's Betta? The giant's answer was swallowed up in the 
noise of the fight, and so was Chattan in the physical motion of it. 
Bodies banged against his. Hot 
angry men panted and cursed in 
his ear. He hunched his shoulders 
and went at it, trying not to hit 
anything with spangles on it. The 
night became an insanely whirling 
mess of fists, feet, faces, clubs, and 
dust, all floundering over pieces of 
wreckage and setter things that 
groaned and crawled away. 

Then, as abruptly as it had begun, it was over. 

The men with the clubs turned 
and ran away. The last of the patrons were gone from the pitch, except a half-dozen injured who lay 
on the ground and cried. A hooting of sirens arose in the distance, 
coming closer. Someone had called 
in an alarm. Chattan stood panting 
and looking dizzily around. He 



44 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



saw Shemsi and! asked again, 
"Where's Betta?" 

"I told you she was all right," 
said Shemsi, and moved the 
wreckage away from the platform. He opened one side of it 
and said, "Come out now." 

Betta and two of the other 
women performers crawled out. 
"Dad calls that the storm cellar," 
Betta said, and looked around, 
alarmed. "Where is Dad? He 
didn't get hurt?" 

"He went to the ship," Chattan 
said. "We thought they might be 
after Shoba Ruk " 

They all turned toward the 
ship. There was no sign of life 
around the open hatch. 

"It is funny," said Shemsi, 
"how quick it began and ended. 
And this is not the kind of place 
where you expect a clem." 

Betta made a sharp sound 
between her teeth and started to 
run. Chattan and the ' others 
went with her. 

There was a queer sweetish 
smell in the open lock of the 
ship, quite faint but getting 
stronger as they went along the 
corridor. Doc Brewer lay on the 
deck half in and half out of 
Shoba Ruk's cabin. Chattan 
thought at first that he was dead, 
tout he stirred when Betta flung 
herself down beside him and 
lifted his head, and suddenly 
Chattan knew what had happened. 



"Knock-out gas," he said. "Get 
him out in the air." He shcrved 
past Betta into the cabin. The 
cook and Nekru were lying on the 
deck there. There was nobody else 
in the room. Shoba Ruk was gone. 

Chattan 's own head was beginning to reel. A couple of those gas 
shells could incapacitate a whole 
ship's company, making it per- ' 
fectly safe for intruders to come 
in no matter how many people 
there might be aboard. It insured 
quietness, too. Very neatly done, 
thought Chattan, and staggered off 
down the corridor carrying part 
of the cook's dead weight with 
Preek. 

Outside there were still no lights, 
but a curious crowd had built up 
around the edges of the pitch. And 
now the ground cars with the 
sirens on them swept in. 

Chattan, working over the unconscious men, looked up at Preek 
and said, "Farah did this. Nobody 
else here even knew about Shoba 
Ruk, so it must have been Farah." 

Preek nodded. He turned 
apprehensively toward the ground 
cars and the men who were getting 
out of them. 

"Farah is a power here at Algol, 
and we are strangers. I wonder 
now how much justice we're due 
to get?" 

TOURING THE NEXT four 
days, Chattan thought they 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



45 



didn't get a lot. It wasn't that the 
authorities were openly oppressive 
or unfair. They were methodical 
and thorough, polite, and utterly 
immovable. There was a law on 
Algol One. Even a thieves' world 
has to have some sort of a code 
to keep it from falling into complete chaos. They asked ' endless 
questions, listened to endless answers, and in regard to Farah they 
always came back to the same remark, "But you have no evidence." 
Which was perfectly true. 

As for Farah, he was gone. His 
shop was locked tight. The men on 
either side of it said that he had 
left on the evening of the day the 
strangers had been there. They 
did not know where he had gone. 
When Chattan asked them if Farah 
had a place somewhere else, they 
didn't know that either. Nobody 
knew. Every face in the city was 
as blank as a shuttered window, 
when any question was asked. 

"I guess," said Doc Brewer, "our 
trouble is we're not crooks, and 
so they figure we're fair game." 

"They're sure covering up for 
Farah," said Chattan grimly. "I 
tried to check with the port authority to see if he'd taken off in a 
ship, and they practically threw 
me out." 

Doc ' Brewer looked with haggard, hating eyes at the crowded 
buildings of the thieves' bazaar. 
"Looks like poor old Lugach is 



gone for sure. And just when it 
looked as though he might come 
round. But what I can't figure 
out is this. Why did Farah want 
him?" 

Chattan shook his head. With 
Preek and Shemsi and Lute he 
prowled the twisting streets, while 
Doc Brewer fought it out with the 
law and cleaned the pitch of its 
bright gay wreckage, salvaging 
what he could. And they got nowhere. Even Preek could not pick 
up anything definite. "I think 
Farah has a place somewhere a 
long way from here, and I think 
everyone knows pretty well where 
it is. I can even get a picture of 
a big sort of a villa with white 
walls, and some jungly gardens 
around it. But that's all, and it 
could be anywhere. It could be on 
another planet." 

They could not find any trace of 
the two men Farah had sent to 
trail them, either, and neither they 
nor the police could turn up the 
slightest indication of who the 
rioters were or how the thing had 
been planned. Late on the fourth 
day an official came, placed a 
formal paper in Doc Brewer's 
hands, nodded, and went away. 
The paper gave them twenty-four 
hours to get fueled and go. 

"To prevent further trouble", 
Doc quoted, and swore. "Well, 

that's the best yet throwing us 

out of this .thieves' den because 



4 6 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



we're undesirable!" 

"What happens if we don't go?" 
asked Betta. 

"They confiscate the Merry Andrew, and probably end up by selling us in the bazaar." Doc's 
shoulders sagged. "I don't know. 
I don't see any help for it." 

Chattan said furiously, "I'm going to make one more try. Come 
on, Preek." 

They went back into the 1 streets, 
in a downpour of rain. In bitter desperation, thinking of Shoba Ruk 
and the dangerous secret he guarded, whatever it might be thinking 

of Laurence Harvey and the Heartworld, and the trouble that waited 
for the Merry Andrew as soon as 
it came again within reach of galactic law — Chattan returned to 
the square where Farah's shop was, 
not expecting anything, not hoping, 
just drawn to it because it was 
the only focal point there was. 

The canopy of crimson silk was 
rolled up. Rain poured into the 
square and ran swishing and roaring into a sunken drain. The light 
was dim and all the colors were 
grayed, and there was no one in 
sight. Farah's place was still shuttered, still dark. 

"We might as well go," said 
Chattan. "There's nothing for us 
here." 

He turned away. Preek touched 
his arm and said, 
"Wait." 



A man stepped out of a doorway and joined them. He was a 
little man with a face like a bird, 
very sharp and predatory, with 
bright shallow eyes. 

"I understand you're looking for 
a piece of information," he said. 
"I can sell it to you, if you want 
to buy." 

Chattan reached out and caught 
him so he could not run away. 
"I'll buy," he said. "I'll buy!" 

Hours later, delayed by refueling 
and red tape, the Merry Andrew 
took off. But the ship's course was 
an odd one. When it was well beyond the atmosphere it shot suddenly off on a tangent and swooped 
back down for a landing on the 
other side of the planet. There was 
no city here, no jumble of buildings and unseemly marts of trade. 
There were vast estates and garden 
villas, resorts set miles apart in lush 
jungle and lake and river, every 
appurtenance of the spacious and 
serene life. There was one particular villa with white walls, even 
more isolated than most. And here 
the Merry Andrew came soaring and 
clattering down in the , private 
dock, its loutish and rusty bulk 
looking painfully out of place beside, the sleek space-yacht that 
was already there. ' 

Chattan and Doc Brewer left the 
ship, with Preek and Shemsi. 
Everyone else had strict orders to 
remain inside. They walked toward 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



47 



the villa. 

Farah and his men met them halfway. 

It was daytime here, high noon. 
Algol blazed in the sky. The jungle smelled moist and green and 
there were flowers in it, and flowers on the white walls of the house, 
crimson and orange. Doc Brewer 
looked at Farah and said, 
"Where's Lugach?" 
Farah smiled. "Well," he said, 
"I'll tell you. You're a little late. 
Laurence Harvey's yacht took off 
from here this morning, with 
Lugach safely under hatches." He 
smiled broadly still, and nodded. 
"I'm indebted to you, really. I 
turned a nice, a very nice profit." 

"Did you?" said Chattan, and 
laughed, a loud harsh sound in 
the green and sunlit quiet. 

CHAPTER VII 

TpARAH LOOKED at Chattan, 
-*- and something flickered in his 
eyes. "I suppose you're angry," he 
said. "And I guess you have a right 
to be, but all's fair on Algol One. 
If you can't protect your property, 
you lose it. It's a kind of game with 
us, though we play it mostly with 
outsiders." 

"It's a kind of a stupid game," 
said Chattan. "Don't you think?" 

"We rather pride ourselves on 
not being stupid," Farah said, "but 
I'll admit I was where the idiot 



was concerned. That's why I was 
determined to make up for it, I 
bought him, as I told you, for very 
little, and sold him to your tramp 
skipper for what I thought then 
was a good price. But then later an 
agent of Laurence Harvey's came 
round and offered a fabulous sum 
for the creature — and you can 
imagine my rage. So naturally, 
when you came to me the other 
day, and I was sure you had 
him---" 

He shrugged eloquently. "One 
doesn't like to be haunted by past 
mistakes, especially where there's 
money involved. I notified Harvey's 
agent, Harvey himself got here 
fast, and I held him up for even 
more than he had offered before. 
Now we are both satisfied." 

Chattan said, "You poor fool. 
Do you know what you've done? 
You've given away the key to the 
greatest secret in the galaxy. 
You've handed it to Harvey on a 
silver platter, for buttons, for nothing. You've given him the Heartworld." 

That name rang like a great bell 
on the silence that followed its 
speaking. Farah stared at Chattan, 
and then at Doc Brewer and Preek 
and Shemsi. He drew a deep breath 
and his mouth tightened. 

"I don't think I quite understood you," he said. "Would you 
repeat that?" 

"The Heartworld," said Chat

tan. "The little idiot has been 
there. He knows where it is." 

Now it was Farah's turn to 
laugh. "The Heartworld? Aren't 
we a trifle old for fairy tales?" 

"Laugh," said Chattan. "Go on, 
choke on it. Why do you suppose 
Harvey was so frantic to get hold 
of a tattooed idiot- - -for a mantel 
ornament?" 

"He told me," Farah said slowly, 
"that the man was a victim of one 
of his company's chemical experiments that went wrong, and he 
wanted to do something for him. I 
thought what he really meant was 
to put him quietly out of the way, 
so he wouldn't make Interstellar 
Research look bad — " 

"And you believed that?" said 
Chattan. "You were easy, Farah. 
You were easy for Harvey." 

Chattan had purpose in his taunt. 
He had been thinking very fast 
since they had found Shoba Ruk 
gone. He had been thinking that 
they had only one chance left now, 
and that it was in the ruthless thief 
before them. 

. They- - -he and Doc and the 
Merry Andrew could not follow Harvey, for they did not know 
where to follow. The only lead 
left was in what Farah knew, or 
could find out. If he could play on 
Farah's greed and rage, the game 
might not be lost yet. . . 

A very hard, cruel light had 
come into Farah's eyes. "I dislike 



VE TALES 

to be played with, and I dislike 
even more to be cheated. You've 
aroused a doubt in my mind now. I 
think you'd better clear it up." 

Chattan nodded toward the 
house. "Let's go inside. The story's 
too long to tell standing here," 

Inside, in a long room with shaded windows and cool ceramic panels 
on the walls, Chattan told the story. 
Not all of it, but just as much as 
he wanted Farah to know. And 
Farah listened, his slim graceful 
body and his eyes reminding Chattan more and more of Preek's comparison to a hunting leopard. 

Chattan concluded, "That's why 
we asked you those questions about 
the man. We hoped if we could find 
out where he was picked up, it 
might give us a lead to the Heartworld. We hoped we could find it 

first. But now " Chattan 

shrugged in assumed hopelessness, " now Harvey's got 

him, which means that Harvey's 
got the Heartworld." 

Doc Brewer said, "I could kill 
you, Farah. Poor Lugach. I hate 
to think what Harvey '11 do to him 
to make him talk." 

Farah's eyes became slits of 
pure anger. "If you're telling me 
the truth," he said, "and I think 
you are, Harvey has robbed me of 
a fortune I can't even count in my 
mind." He made a furious gesture 
and sprang up. "He won't get 
away with it." 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



49 



"It's only a sort of a game he 
plays," said Chattan cruelly. 

Earah looked at him. "Very 
well. I deserve that. But the question is what do we do now?" 

; "We?" said Chattan. 

"It is in my mind," said Farah, 
"that we could join forces to snatch 
the richest prize in history out of 
Harvey's hands, even yet." 

Chattan's heart leaped. The merchant-thief was taking the bait as 
he had hoped. But he made his 
voice dull and hopeless, as he said, 

"Even if we trusted you, Farah 

which we don't what could 

we do together? Shoba Ruk was the 
key to the Heartworld. And he's 
gone. You gave him to Harvey, 
remember?" 

A hidden fire flashed in Farah's 
eyes. "Listen, Chattan. You didn't 
tell me everything. You got some 
clue from Shoba Ruk to where the 
Heartworld is. Didn't you?" 

"We did," Chattan said bluntly, 
"and I didn't tell you. Anyway, 
it's not enough." 

- "But," pressed Farah, "it would 
be enough, if you knew also where 
Shoba Ruk was first picked up in 
space? You said that, you said 
that that would give you a lead to 
the Heartworld." 

Chattan stared at him. "Now I 
get it. You're proposing a deal?" 

"Exactly," Farah spoke with a 
wolflike snap. "I can get that information, from the man who did 



pick up Shoba Ruk. I can also 
check fast with Thirbar about Shoba 
Ruk. If we put together what we 
know, we can still find the Heartworld." 

CHATTAN ASSUMED a look 
of heavy reluctance. "I don't 
know.- What good would it do to 

find it when Harvey's ahead 

of us?" 

"He can't be far ahead," said 
Farah. "And my space-yacht is 
even faster than his, for business 
reasons. We can overtake him, 
maybe even reach the Heartworld 
before him. What do you say?" 

Chattan looked at Doc Brewer, 
who looked blankly back at him 
and said, "Well. I would like to. 
get Shoba Ruk out of Harvey's 
hands." 

Preek looked worried and unhappy, but Chattan ignored him. 
He had jockeyed Farah into the 
place where he wanted him, and 
now there was still a chance! 

He said slowly, "All right, Farah. 
But two things. First, no more 
than two of your men go with us 
if we go " 

"You really don't trust me, do 
you?" said Farah, with a nasty 
little smile. 

"That," Chattan assured him, 
"is an understatement. And secondly I'll tell you what we know 

after we reach the region Shoba 
Ruk came from." 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



Farah thought briefly, and then 
nodded. "All right. I think we 
understand each other. I'll get 
busy. I don't think it'll take long 
- - -I've channels of information 
that even the galactic police haven't." 

"We'll be in the Merry Andrew," 
said Chattan. 

They went back out of the villa 
and into the carnival ship. And 
the moment they were inside, 
Preek burst into remonstrance. He 
said, 

"I read only one thing in Farah's 
mind. Treachery, treachery, treachery! / would not go anywhere with 
that man!" 

Chattan nodded. "Of course. He 
plans to fox us if we actually find 
the Heartworld. We'll have to be 
ready and alert- - -first to deal 
with Harvey, and then with Farah." 

He turned and said, "Doc, I'd 
rather you didn't go. Shemsi and 
Preek and I will be enough. You 
stay here with Betta." 

Doc instantly told him where 
he could go, so angrily that Chattan 
said hastily, "All right, all right, 
come along if that's the way you 
feel " 

Betta turned and went out of 
the cabin. Chattan followed, and 
found her in the dingy cabin where 
he had first met her. 

He said. "I'm sorry, Betta. But 
Doc will come. Don't worry, I'll 
look out for him the very best I 



can." 

She turned. There were tears in 
her eyes. Chattan had never seen 
her anything but brisk and competent before and he was shocked. 

She said, "That's fine. And who's 
going to look out for you? You 
think you're so tough, but a couple 
of tigers like Harvey and Farah 
will eat you like a lamb, and- - -" 
She turned away again. "Oh, all 
right, you big fool, go ahead and 
die or lose your wits like Lugach. 
Go 'on, all of you — " 

> She didn't finish, because he bent 
his head and kissed her and then 
held her so tightly that she had no 
more breath to talk. 

"I'm crazy about you. too, 
Betta," he said. "But listen- --we 
have to do this. Whatever happens 
about the Heartworld, we have to 
nail Harvey and clear ourselves or 
we'll ;be on the wrong side of the 
law for life." 

In the next few hours it turned 
out that Farah did indeed have 
swift channels of information. Over 
the interstellar communication system, far faster than light or even 
than a ship in overdrive, came the 
information from Thirbar that a 
man named Shoba Ruk, scholar, 
archaeologist, and explorer, had 
left on an expedition to an undisclosed destination eight years before, and was missing and presumed 
dead. Shoba Ruk, the communique 
added, was a specialist in compara


THE TATTOOED MAN 



Si 



tive cultures and the diffusion of 
mythology — especially the Heartworld myth. Thirbar was traditionally one of the first colonies, and 
therefore presumably fairly close 
to the source. Laurence Harvey, 
dded the message, had studied 
under Shoba Ruk there for two 
years. 

The other information came 
from closer at hand. Farah's private spy system, working through 
the customary channels of the 
thieves' world, turned up the friend 
from whom Farah had bought 
Shoba Ruk on Algol Three. 

"He remembered quite clearly," 
Farah said. "He found a lifeboat 
drifting. There were three men 
aboard. Two were dead. The third 

one was Lugach — Shoba Ruk 

as near dead as you can get, 
"rtly from starvation. He took 
him in and fed him up, not 
realizing until later that the man's 
mind was gone. Then he sold him 
cheap to me, ' because of that 
tattooing." 

"But where?" asked Chattan 
eagerly. "Where in space did he 
find him?" 

"Beyond Eridanus. In "a" sector 
well beyond the sector of Thirbar." 

Minutes later, in the chartroom 
-f Farah's yacht, they stared with 
excited eyes and pounding hearts 
t the three-dimensional representtion of that sector in the tank. 
"It takes in an awful lot of 



space," said Doc Brewer. 

But Chattan, remembering what 
Shoba Ruk had said, was looking 
for a green star. It had to be a 
green star. 

In that sector, there were three 
green stars with planets. Two were 
well-known, prosaic systems, on the 
extreme edges of the sector, impossible as candidates for the lost 
Heartworld. 

rpHE THIRD, ISOLATED in 
the deep center of the sector, 
was a posion star. Lethal radiation, 
said the chart. Planetary system unexplored. At least jour ships known 
to have perished in approach. All 
shipping warned to stay clear of 
radiation zone. 

Chattan's heart sank. How could 
the Heartworld be there? How 
could life begin on the planet of a 
star that was lethal to life? And 
yet- - -Shoba Ruk himself had 
said, "The star kills," 

Farah said, "I've filled my part 
of the bargain. Now — where in 
that sector?" 

Chattan knew that, even if he 
dared trust Farah enough to tell 
him, to tell him now would end it. 
Farah would never believe in the 
last possibility now left. 

He said, "Oh no, not yet, Farah. 
Not till we reach that sector. I'll 
set the course." 

Farah said, "So you're afraid 
I'll leave you behind if you tell? 



52 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



All right. We'll start." 

While Doc went hastily to get 
Shemsi, Chattan went to the 
bridge of Farah's yacht. It was 
good to 'be on a bridge again. He 
had been like a fish out of water 
ever since that night on Rigel Two. 
He began the regular pre-flight 
check, admiring the beautiful 
modernity of the control system, 
and trying not to think about 
Betta, trying to think of anything 
else, of Harvey and how they 
would get him, of Shoba Ruk and 
a poison star. 

Farah came in, dressed in a 
spaceman's coverall. He said 
suspiciously, "/ only brought two 
men, as you stipulated. But I've 
got four of you aboard. That little 
furry chap wouldn't let the big one 
go without him." 

"Lute and Shemsi are great 
friends," Chattan said. "But if 
you're worried, we can still call it 
off." 

Farah gave him a piercing look. 
"I wonder," he said softly, "if 
you're as clever as you think you 
are." He strapped himself into the 
pilot's seat. "I'll take her off. I'm 
used to her and she's a lot crankier 
than any freighter." 

Warning bells rang, and Farah's 
hand pressed down on the control 
board, and the yacht screamed 
skyward on a trail of flame, up 
into the blaze of Algol and then, 
turning away from the triple suns, 



it plunged toward the starry firmament. 

Unnumbered stars were a great 
blaze before them, the sprawling 
magnificence of the galactic spaces, 
the shining cataracts of the vast 
star-streams, the pulsing glow of 
nebulae and brooding blackness of 
dark clouds and lonely lighthouse 
sparks of far-drifted stars, all hitting the vision like a blow. Chattan thought that long and long ago 
the ships of the Heartworld might 
have sped through these same 
spaces, and where now were those 
galactic mariners of old? Lost in 

myth and fable, lost in shadow 

and where would they be when 
their own voyage ended? 

The warning siren for overdrive 
screeched, after Chattan had set a 
course on the computer banks for 
the sector that was their destination. They made the shift, and 
then, for a while, there was noth- > 
ing to do but wait. 

And talk. Chattan talked, to 
Doc Brewer and Shemsi and Lute, 
out of hearing of Farah and his 
two silent, watchifig men. He felt 
a great and growing doubt, and it 
made him seek reassurance from 
them, a reassurance they could not 
give. 

"I'm getting old, Joe," said Doc 
Brewer, "And I'm afraid.' I'm 
afraid we'll never find Harvey or 
Shoba Ruk, that they're dead like 
others that tried to find the Heart

53 



world." 

"But Shoba Ruk was there," 
Chattan insisted. "He was there 

once, and came away we know 

that from the name "Lugach" that 
was tattooed oh his hands." 

He had thought about that, 
going over it again and again, 
trying to understand. And he 
thought he understood now. 

"Don't you see, Shoba Ruk must 
have tattooed that name on his own 
hands, so that if he lived to get 
away, the name would make him 
■remember. Which means his memory, his mind, was beginning to 
go when he did it." 

"But what about the other 
tattooing on him, the silver lines 
all over him?" said Doc. "He 

didn't do that to himself. And 

if he felt his mind going, what 
hellish kind of place was it that 
he was getting away from?" 

That was the thought that 
haunted Chattan's mind. He 
thought he guessed the answer to 
it, but he didn't want to tell that 
shattering answer until he had to. 

Time crawled endlessly on the 
indicators. Chattan waited, and 
ate, and slept, and waited, with 
the bitter taste of defeat already 
°n his tongue. It seemed to him 
that if Harvey had taken Shoba 
Ruk to the place that he thought, 
^ey must indeed already both be 
de ad, and if that were so, the whole 
ftiad venture was useless. 



The countless hours became like 
a strange dream. It was always 
like that, in overdrive, but this 
time more than ever before. And 
he almost dreaded the awakening 
from that dream, when it finally 
came. 
He had made his calculations 
with minute care. When they did, 
finally, go through the cosmic 
turbulence of translation and ride 
once more in normal space, the 
yacht was in space not far from 
the baleful glare of a great green 
star. 

Farah said, "Now where?" 

Chattan nodded to the green 
star. "There." 

Farah looked at the star, and 
then went and looked at the chart. 
His face got tight and dangerous. 
"That's a lethal star. Nobody can 
go near that. What kind of game 
are you playing, Chattan?" 

The others had crowded into the 
bridge to see, and they too looked 
at Chattan uneasily. 

Chattan said, " 'You have not 
the key of entrance to the vault. 
And the green star kills. I only am 
left alive.' " He added, "That's what 
Shoba Ruk said." 

"But it's not possible!" cried 
Farah. "The radiation of that star 
kills, at more than planetary distances. How could anyone land on 
its world? How could a world of 
that star be the Heartworld?" 
"The star," Chattan said, "may 



54 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



not always have been dead. They 
do change sometimes, you know. It 
may have changed, in the ages 
since the Heartworld." 

Farah made a violent gesture. 
"That makes no difference to us. 
(How can a man land there? How 
could Shoba Ruk have landed 
there?" 

Chattan shook his head. "I don't 
know. But he said he had. He was 
very upset about what he found 
there, 'afraid Laurence Harvey 
would find it. He mentioned a 
vault, and a key to it Harvey didn't 
have. That's all I know. But he 
must have found a way to beat the 
lethal radiation, on the way in, at 
least." 

"On the way out," said Doc 
Brewer grimly, "I guess he didn't. 
And that's what happened to his 
mind." 

Farah looked long again at the 
distant, glaring green eye of ill 
omen. He said, between his teeth, 

"Nobody could go close to that. 
We've come all this way for nothing- - -nothing!" 

O ADAR AND RADIO were alA *-most useless against the radiation that poured from the green star. 
They tried to locate Harvey's 
yacht with them, and they could 
find nothing. 

Farah said, "If he came here, 
he must have made it. Otherwise 
the yacht would be drifting, a 



derelict. If he came here " 

"Unless he crashed on the 
planet," Chattan said. 

There was only one planet, as 
far as they could see. From where 
they hung in space it appeared 
above them, very tiny and far off, 
its underside flashing a cold green 
crescent where the light of the 
primary touched it. A line of 
shadow, pencil thin, projected outward from it, lengthening until it 
was lost in the surrounding dark of 
space. 

Chattan said doggedly, "It has 
to be the Heartworld. And, living 
or dead, Harvey and Shoba Ruk 
are on it right now." 

That thought seemed to sting 
Farah to fury. He cried, "But we 
can't land. What can we do?" 

Chattan looked at the planet, 
the tiny fleck of fire trailing its 
shadow line. "There must be a way. 
Shoba Ruk made it, and he didn't 1 
have anyone to tell him how, 
either. Shut up and let me think." 

They shut up. The yacht drifted, 
and Chattan watched the little faroff world move around its sun. 
Evil-looking child of an evil parent, he thought, and the line of the 
eclipse is like a black path to- - 
A black path. 

He cried out, "The shadow! Go 
in along the shadow, and you have 
the planet itself as a shield against 
the radiation!" 

Farah turned his head, and sud


THE TATTOOED MAN 



55 



denly his eyes were hot and eager. 
"Of course," he said. "That 
must be it. It'll be tricky, running 
that shadow. It always is, they 
move so fast. But we can do it." 

Chattan's belly was knotted 
tight inside and the palms of his 
hands were wet. "We'll take a vote 
on whether we try it." 

"Vote, hell," said Farah. "We 
go in." 

Chattan said, "You can't do it 
alone, Farah. And everyone here 
will be risking his life and sanity. 
I say we vote." 

Farah's men, not liking it but 
-more afraid of their boss than of 
the unknown menace of the star, 
said yes. Shemsi and Lute hung 
back and waited for Doc Brewer. 

Brewer sweated. Greed and the 
nobler desire to help Shaba Ruk, 
and prevent Harvey from stealing 
God-knew-what that belonged to 
the people of the galaxy, told him 
■p go ahead. Fear and common 
sense told him to go back. 

"Do you really think it's safe?" 
he asked Chattan. 
' "Not safe. Just possible." 
Brewer ran his visibly shaking 
. hands over his face. "Oh, well," he 
said "All right." 

And looked as though he immediately regretted it. 

Shemsi and Lute nodded, not 
looking very happy either. Farah 
said impatiently, "Satisfied?" 
Chattan leaned forward. "Let's 



go." 

The yacht swung in a wide looping curve, seeking the end of that 
thin shadow-line. The computers 
clacked, figuring the planet's orbital path and speed. Chattan fed 
the results to the compensator 
banks. He made the final check 
with Farah. 

They shot forward, down the 
black path of the shadow. 

And now the body of the planet 
was between them and the sun, a 
round disc . of darkness quickly 
growing. Chattan watched it, and 
listened . to the radiation counters, 
and checked the kick-blasts of the 
steering-jets that kept them in 
their narrow, ever-moving lane of 
safety. One moment of failure, one 
miscalculation, and the same thing 
would happen to them that must 
have happened to ' Shoba Ruk's 
lifeboat on its outward trip. 

It occurred to him to wonder 
what really had happened to the 
original ship of that expedition, 
and the rest of its crew. It had 
seemed not improbable that it had 
simply crashed in landing on a 
wild world, but now under the 
circumstances Chattan was not sure. 
He thought that radiation might 
have killed them. But that did not 
explain how Shoba Ruk and two 
others had escaped. 

The planetary disc grew larger, 
blotting out more and more of the 
sun. Presently it covered everything 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



but the sullen fires of the corona, 
a coiling, and writhing of green 
flames as deadly as the serpents 
they resembled. 

And suddenly Chattan saw 
something, a curious ghostly gleaming that seemed to surround the 
planet like a phantom envelope. 
Before he could speak they were 
into it. Indicator needles jumped 
madly on the board, registering not 
radiation but energy. A brush discharge burned momentarily from 
every metal surface, and beyond the 
port a sheeting of white light flared 
from the hull and was gone. 

"Force field!" said Chattan, and 
stared at Farah. "Good Lord. Do 
you suppose that's the answer? 
The whole planet shielded against 
the radiation?" 

"It could be." The yacht plunged downward into atmosphere, into 
heavy air that screamed along the 
hull. The radiation counters remained steady. "The atmosphere 
hasn't been poisoned, at any rate." 

"And that means, of course, that 
the sun wasn't always lethal, and 
that intelligent minds here erected 
a shield when it became so." Looking down at the black night side 
of the planet, so close now below 
them, Chattan shivered with a 
thrill of pure primitive fear. 

"I wonder," he said, "if any of 
them- are still living?" 

"Who?" asked Doc Brewer. 

"The First Born. If this is the 



Heartworld, really." 

"The main thing now," said 
Farah, "is to find Harvey's ship. 
We're close enough now. Level off 
on standard survey pattern." 

>-pHE YACHT WENT INTO 

an orbital path of its own, high 
enough to avoid the highest possible 
mountain, low enough to use scanners and detector devices efficiently. 

"Field shows nothing but open 
country below. A few hills, but 
mostly flat." 

"Keep going." 

"Still nothing. We're overtaking 
the terminator." 
"Keep going." 

The sleek silver yacht shot over 
the edge of night into a 
green dawn, weirdly beautiful, 
dimmed and pearled by the distortion of the sheltering force-field. 
The country below was a long 
tumbling slope that fell from snowcapped mountains across half a 
continent, over rocky ledges and 
tilted plains, to the edge of a tideless sea. It was noontime there, 
and the glass-green water lay 
smooth against the shore, and all 
along the curving edge as far as 
sight would carry there were ruins, 
so huge, so wide, and so very old 
that the meaning of them was lost 
and they were only a reminder 
that some mighty thing had been 
here and now was not. 

In an open space that might 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



57 



once have been the greatest starport in the galaxy, hub of an empire that spanned a million stars, 
one minute speck showed, less than 
a grain of sand in all that emptiness. Harvey's yacht. 

Farah's yacht came down beside it. 

There was no sign of life there. 
The hatch was open. There was no 
one inside. Everything seemed to 
be in order, but just inside the 
hatch, on the metal floor, Lute's 
sharp eyes saw a fleck of red. 

"Blood?" 

"It looks like it," Chattan said. 
He listened to the sultry stillness, 
and felt cold. "We ought to leave 
a guard. One of your men,* Farah, 
and one of ours." 

Farah nodded. He spoke to one 
of the men, who returned to 
Farah's yacht. Chattan said to Doc 
Brewer, 

"You, too. Hang onto that 

gun " Farah had an arsenal of 

remarkable completeness aboard 
and they had armed themselves 
from it - -and keep alert. We 
may need help, and you'll be the 
only man who can give it to us." 

He did not add that he was 
doing his best to live up to the 
promise he had given Betta. 

Doc Brewer made a perfunctory 
protest, looking uneasily at the 
wall of tangled forest and humped 
rijin beyond the ships. Then he too 
went back to Farah's yacht, 



obviously relieved. 

The others, Farah and his gunman, Chattan and Shemsi and 
Lute, walked across the broken, 
buried tarmac and entered the 
forest, going toward the sea. 

A breeze went rustling through 
the treetops. Down below where 
the men 'were there w as no breeze. 
They began to sweat. Their boots 
stumbled among the ribs of stone 
and metal left there by dead buildings. Presently they came upon a 
place where an enormous road had 
run. The forest was thinner here, 
held down by the adamantine 
pavement that defied the trees to 
root. 

There was a path. 

It was not much more than a 
rabbit run, but it had not been 
made by rabbits, and it was used. 
Chattan's heart Began to beat 
harder. Small silent shouts of alarm 
rang through his nervous system. 

"Something's alive here, then," 
he said, and Farah nodded. 

Lute, who had been glancing 
around and sniffing uneasily, said, 
"Wait while I look ahead." He 
climbed swiftly into the thicker 
trees and was gone, agile as any 
monkey. 

The others waited. Twice Chattan thought he heard laughter, but 
it was so muffled and indistinct 
that he could not he sure. It sounded like the laughter of children 
playing hide and seek. 



58 



IMAGINATIVE TALES, 



Lute came back, scrambling so 
hurriedly through the branches 
that he almost fell into Shemsi's 
arms. 

"Up ahead there," he panted. 
"A dead man. I think he must be 
one of Harvey's crew." Lute's eyes 
were wide with horror. "There's 
something evil here. He- - -he was 
tortured to death." 

"Did you see anyone?" asked 
Farah, and Lute said, "No." 

They went on, and again Chattan thought he heard the fleeting 
laughter. 

They found the man. What Lute 
had said was true. The mutilated 
corpse was hung like a rag doll on 
a point of metal sticking up through 
grass and creepers. The point was 
shaped like a gigantic sword, and 
perhaps once it had been part of 
a monument on this triumphal 
way. 

They left it where it was, not 
knowing what else to do. Lute took 
to the trees again. They went on, 
following the path. The salt smell of 
seawater thickened on the air. 

The ancient roadway ended in 
a vast square, with the whiteness 
of marble thrusting here and there 
through the green- - -marble 
hands and limbs and noble foreheads, torsos and thighs, scattered 
like the aftermath of some battle 
between colossi. At the far side of 
the square was a building, or rather a part of the walls of what had 



once been a building, with the 
green sea showing through them. 
Even then, roofless and broken as 
it was, it was staggering to the 
mind to look at it and recognize its 
size. And Farah said, in a tone 
very close to reverence, 

"That must be the Hall of Suns 
they speak of in the legends, the 
real heart and center of the old 
empire. My God. And I never 
dreamed it was real." 

Lute came down from the high 
trees and said, "The men we're 
looking for are there. I saw one of 
them cross an open space inside." 

With their guns ready in their 
hands, they began to cross the 
ruined square, between the bits 
of marble. They were about halfway across when Chattan saw the 
children. 

HpHERE WERE THREE of 
A them, two boys and a girl, 
crouched behind a marble head that 
lay on its side and had only the 
sad blurred outlines of a face. They 
sprang up giggling when they knew 
they had been seen,* and Chattan 
thought that they had deliberately 
let themselves be discovered. They 
were quite naked, slender and 
frail-looking, their skin an- indeterminate dun color with a 
greenish cast. They were marked 
like Shaba Ruk with a tracery of 
silver lines, and they looked to 4>e 
about eight or nine years old, but 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



59 



there was something in their faces 
that disturbed Chattan, arousing 
the instinctive revulsion that is 
caused by something unnatural. 

He spoke to them, and they 
scampered away laughing, peering 
back over their shoulders with 
bright secretive eyes. Then they 
stopped, and the little girl put her 
finger to her lips and pointed to 
the walls of the great building. She 
shook her head and beckoned. 

"They want us to follow them," 
Chattan said. 

"Yes, but where? And what are 
they?" said Farah. "If they're 
kids, where are their parents? 
Where do they live? And who 
killed that poor devil we found on 
the road back there?" 

"I don't know," said Chattan. 

Now all three of the children 
were pantomiming enemies in the 
great building, enemies lying in 
wait. They gestured, urging the 
men to follow in a way they would 
show them where the enemies 
would not see. 

"They seem friendly enough," 
Farah said. "They're trying to 
warn us. Harvey and his men must 
be waiting for us. They'd have seen 
us land." He glanced quickly at 
the gaunt arches of the walls. 
"We're set-up targets if we go in 
this way, that's sure. They may 
know a better one." He made his 
decision. "It won't hurt to see." 
Chattan thought it might very 



well hurt, but it was only a 
hunch based on the look in the 
children's eyes. He followed reluctantly, crouching low, keeping 
one eye on the ruins. The children 
ran ahead, laughing. 

They passed through a dense 
screening growth of shrub and vine. 
And suddenly the children had disappeared and they were in a huge 
square bay of the walls enclosed on 
three sides, where a state doorway might once have been. Chattan 
and Farah both realized the danger 
even before Lute's cry warned 
them. The whole party was diving 
for cover when the first shot was 
fired, but it was too late for Farah's 
gunman, who dropped and lay feebly struggling on the ground. 

The children had led them with 
great care into a trap. 

Guns fired now from all three 
sides of the bay. Lying flat in a 
thicket that grew between the ancient paving stones, Chattan fired 
back and tried to figure a way but. 
There didn't seem to be any. They 
couldn't go back, and they couldn't stay here pinned down. He 
counted four guns — Harvey, probably Barbour and VanFleet, one 
of the crew. Shots were whacking 
close around him, kicking up dust 
and chips of stone, searing the 
leaves of the bushes. Oh hell, he 
thought, might as well get dropped 
running as lying still. 

"Shemsi," he said. "Lute. Cover 



6o 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



me." 

He couldn't see them but lie 
knew they were close by, and at 
once they began blasting the broken 
walls and window openings with 
everything they had. Chattan got 
his feet under him. He broke from 
the thicket and ran, and hit another clump of brush, rolled under 
it and out on the other side, and 
ran again, sideways, on all fours. 
Inside the walls somebody shouted. 
Shots came close, so close he could 
feel the hot breath of their passing, 
but he couldn't stop now, he was 
afraid to stop, if he stopped he 
was dead. He ran and scuttled 
and rolled, and there was somebody else with him, going low like 
a big cat with infinite grace and 
speed. Farah. 

They hit the porch together and 
fell between the mighty sheltering 
columns and crouched there panting. Footsteps rang on stone inside. Chattan flung one arm across 
Farah's chest and pressed him 
back, into the shadowy back of 
the niche. A man appeared in the 
doorway, the giant portal from 
which the doors had ages ago vanished, but which was still magnificent. It was Barbour, edging cautiously around the jamb of carved 
stone, dwarfed by its height and 
size. His face was alert and happy. 
This was his kind of work and he 
liked it. Chattan let him get all 
the way through, looking for them, 



and then he shot him, without any 
regret. 

"Come on," he said to Farah, 
and they ran together toward the 
door. Just as they passed through 
it Chattan looked back into the 
court. The firing was going on without change, but the children had 
appeared again. There were two 
or three others with them now. 
They had crept out of the woods 
and caught hold of the wounded 
man and now they were dragging 
him back into the woods with them. 
It dawned on Chattan what had so 
repelled him about them. Their 
eyes were not the eyes of children, 
and they were quite mad. He knew 
now who had killed the man in 
the road. 

TJE HAD NO TIME then to 
- ■*• say or do anything about it. 
Inside the doorway he and Farah 
took different ways, he to the left, 
Farah to the right. He crouched and 
peered around the corner, hearing 
the firing outside intensify as the 
three out there prepared to make 
a rush. Harvey and • one of the 
crewmen were firing through the 
tail windows. He shouted to them 
to drop their guns. His voice was 
drowned in a burst of firing from 
Farah's side. The crewman spun 
around and snapped a shot at him, 
and Chattan dropped him. Harvey 
stood irresolute, his face white and 
set, and as crazy in its own way, 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



6r 



Chattan thought, as the faces of the 
maniacal children outside. Farah 
came running back and said, "There 
was only one man there. He wasn't as good a shot as he thought 
he was." His eyes brightened. "Ah," 
he said. "Harvey." 

He raised his gun. 

Chattan knocked it down. "Drop 
it," he said to Harvey. "Drop it 
while you have the chance." 

Harvey dropped it. 

The place was quiet now. Shemsi 
and Lute came in, Shemsi wincing 
over a flesh-wound in his hip. They 
all stood around Harvey, and he 
looked at them like a man who has 
already died. 

Chattan said, "Where is Shoba 
Ruk?" 

Harvey whispered, "Down there." 
They turned. And now for the 
first time . Chattan saw the place 
he had come into, and he forgot 
everything else for the moment in 
a rush of awe and wonder. 

From this great doorway a double ' line of columns led' for what 
seemed to the eye an endless distance, across a pavement cumbered 
now with fallen pediments and the 
shattered fragments of the roof, 
but still so long and wide between 
its enclosing walls that the effect 
was impressive beyond words. The 
towering columns supported nothing but the sky, and the green 
misty sunlight poured in unchecked, and the green ocean showed 



through the empty window arches. 
And all across that mighty pavement, under the dust and wreckage, 
there was a shining and glittering 
of jewels. 

Blazons of empire in the Hall of 
Suns. Looking out across them, 

Chattan was stunned not by the 

value of the gems which was beyond counting, but by what they 
stood for. The pavement itself was 
polished stone as black and deep 
as space itself, and all across it the 
suns and constellations burned, 
the star-colonies, the bright swarming children of this mother-world 
of men. Here to this place must 
have come the embassies from Hercules, from Cepheus and Draco 
and the shining coils of Hydra, 
from near and far along the brilliant ever-turning star-stream of 
the Milky Way. Here had been 
splendor unimaginable, power and 
pomp beyond belief. Here had been 
Empire, beside which the greatest 
empires of Earth were only as 
candles to a nova. 

Then he heard a rustling noise 
and looked around. The children 
with the mad eyes had come into 
the Hall of Suns, laughing as they 
darted and crept among the ruins, 
peering at the stranger men. 

A cold shook went through Chattan, bringing him sharply back to 
reality. The mighty Empire had 
sown its seed through all the galaxy, but it had not endured. Mor


62 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



tal as the puny empires of Egypt 
and Hatti, it had come crashing 
down, and now this was left of the 
mother world, the Heartworld, the 
cradle of mankind- - -this wreckage 
of stone and flesh, cold-shining 
jewels, cold-shining eyes, empty, 
all-forgetting, all-forgotten. He 
looked up at the lethal star that 
burned above them, and he wondered, and was afraid. 

"There he is," said Lute. "I see 
him. Down there where that covered 
arch still stands." 

Chattan shook himself. He went 
toward the covered arch by the 
west wall, and the others came with 
him, keeping Harvey in the center. 
And Harvey's feet dragged heavily 
on the gemmed stars. 

Shoba Ruk lay under the arch, 
bound and gagged. They freed him. 
He stood up and spoke to them, 
and Lute and Shemsi looked at 
him with a queer shyness. This 
was not the old Lugach they had 
known so long. This was a man. 
Chattan had been right. The process 
of recovery he had seen started on 
the Merry Andrew had been completed during the voyage out with 
Harvey. Now Shoba Ruk was 
gaunt and haggard, a man tortured 
by the possibility of disaster, but 
mentally whole. He frowned at 
Chattan, at Shemsi and Lute, as 
though he only half remembered 
them, and then he smiled briefly 
and said, 



"They were afraid I'd cry out 
and warn you. Now shall I thank 
God you're here, or is it only an 
exchange of evils?" 

Farah stepped forward, smiling. 
"I came here for the treasure, if 
that's what you mean. Harvey 
tried to cheat me out of it, but 
I'm very hard to cheat." 

.Harvey cursed him in a low 
harsh whisper. "All my life I've 
worked and studied and believed. 
But what are you? A thief." 

"You're both thieves," said Shoba 
Ruk. "Harvey a man possessed, 
and you- - -I seem "to know you, 
and I have no good memory as I 
have of these others." 

He looked past Farah at the 
shadows under the arch, where a 
vaulted doorway showed, open and 
unguarded, and from there to the 
children creeping and tittering 
among the high columns. Then he 
looked up, at the green sun.. 

"So," he said, "you want the 
treasure of the Heartworld. Shall 
I tell you what it is? It is death 
and destruction and madness and 
horror. It is knowledge, yes. It is 
power, yes. And its fruits are these." 

TTIS VOICE RANG against the 
■*• shattered walls, and the children paused to listen. ' 

"The mother-world grew old, 
like a human mother. She grew 
jealous and grasping, and when her 
children tried to grow and think 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



63 



for themselves she fell into a fury 
and subdued them with terrible 
wars, pitting her more obedient 
sons against rebels. But even that 
way she could not hold them, and 
the wars spread and got out of 
control, and she saw her whole 
great empire staggering toward collapse, and herself toward ruhi. So 
she isolated herself from the deepening ruin. She poisoned her sun." 

He flung up his hand, pointing to 
the baleful star. "At one and the 
same time, she rejected her children 
and protected herself with complete isolation. The force-field 
allowed life to continue on this 
planet, but from then on there 
was no communication with the 
outside. The parent sun under 
which life first grew had turned 
murderous, preventing the mutinous children of the Heartworld 
from attacking it in force. And 
the Empire fell, and the Heartworld passed into legend. And here 
now are the last of your elder 
brothers, the First Born. Look at 
them, the fruits of complete isolation, the mad degenerate things 
who have almost lost the ability to 
grow up. With each generation 
fewer and fewer reach maturity. 
Soon no more will be born at all, 

I and then " 

He made a gesture of finality. 
"That is the power Harvey 
wants. That is the treasure you 
seek. The knowledge of how to 



poison a star." 

Chattan was speechless with 
shock. "You mean they did that 
themselves, deliberately? How?" 

"By upsetting the chemical balance of the solar cycle with certain 
carefully measured charges, so that 
the radiation output is altered 
both in kind and intensity. It's all 
there in the vault, the whole secret, 
along with others — mostly weapons and destruction, since that 
was what they specialized in in the 
later days. Not one thing beneficial to mankind. I was heartbroken 
when I first entered it, to find 
nothing there but death." 

Harvey's eyes blazed with dull 
fire. "It's not for you to judge. 
You're a scholar, not a scientist." 

"And I'm a thief." said Farah 
softly. "Good enough. This is the 
greatest hoard in the galaxy, and 
there's no telling the price it'll 
■bring. I'll take it." 
Chattan said, "No." 
Farah looked at him and laughed, 
and raised a gun. Chattan dived 
in low, the gun-blast searing his 
shoulder. He groped for the weapon 
and couldn't get hold of it. 

Then, suddenly, right in front of 
his eyes, Farah's face went purple 
as two great hands gripped his 
throat from behind. They were 
Shemsi's hands, and Shemsi shook 
Farah once, not gently, and the 
gun fell from his hand. 

The children tittered and drew 



64 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



near. 

"Bind him," said Shoba Ruk, 
looking at Farah. "I am going now 
to do what I should have done 
before. I was afraid to take the 
responsibility then. Now I know I 
must. I am going to destroy the 
vault." 

"No," cried Harvey. "No, no. 
Stop him." 

He ran suddenly and placed himself between Shoba Ruk and the 
open door of the vault. 

Shoba Ruk shook his head. "You 
haven't the key, Harvey. I told 
you that. You can't enter without 
the key. And I have it." He 
touched the silver markings on his 
skin. 

Chattan stared, unbelievingly. 

"You mean the tattooing on 

your body is the key?" 

Shoba Ruk nodded. "Yes. A 
metallic pattern, always the same, 
that lets a man who wears it on his 
skin pass through the gateway 
without triggering the forces that 
guard it." He looked at the tittering children. "They have the key 
upon them, just as their forefathers 
long ago had it, a pattern coming 
unchanged down through the ages. 
I made friends with these little 
ones and they put the key-pattern 
on my skin. They did it gladly — 
it is very painful, and they enjoy 
pain. They killed the others, all 
but two " 

He stopped, and then said, "It 



is the talisman, with which the 
men of the Heartworld guarded 
their most secret vault. And without it you can't go in, Harvey. 
Never." 

Harvey whispered, "I don't believe you. It's a lie to frighten me 
away.' I won't let you destroy it. 
It's mine, and the Heartworld is 

mine. All these years There are , 

weapons in there. I'll stop you." 

He turned and plunged through 
the door of the vault. 

Instantly there was a flare of 
white light so intense that Chattan 
was blinded by it even at that distance. For a fraction of a second 
Harvey was caught motionless in 
the center of it, and then he was 
gone. Literally gone, leaving no 
trace. They stood, staring, dazed 
and stunned by the brief and terrible violence of that end. 

There was a moment of silence, 
and then, quite steadily, his head> 
erect, Shoba Ruk went through the 
doorway into the vault. 

TTOURS LATER, Farah's yacht 
"*■ * approached the final stage of 
its dangerous journey back along 
the eclipse-shadow path. 

Farah, much subdued, was at 
the controls with Chattan. Doc 
.Brewer, with Shemsi and Lute beside him, sat very quietly, sweating 
out the passage and glancing covertly from time to time at Shoba Ruk, 
who had returned to his old pose 



THE TATTOOED MAN 



of brooding. Behind them, the 
Heartworld was only a dark disc 
against the deadly sun. 

"So much power," said Shoba 
Ruk, hardly realizing that he spoke. 
"I had it in my hands, and I let it 
go. I let it go." 

Chattan realized that Shoba Ruk 
was human, too, and tempted by 
the same things that tempted others. 

"You did the right thing," he 
said, looking at the evil green light 
outside their path of darkness. "No 
man, no world, should have that 
secret!" ■ 



He glanced at Farah, but the 
master- thief kept his head averted. 

The yacht emerged from the 
shadow, beyond the danger point. 

Chattan looked at free space, 
blazing with its loops and chains 
and rivers of stars, the beautiful 
domain of man given to him by the 
mother-world in the days of her 
youth. That glory she had had, that 
good she had done. Let her memory rest in peace. 

The yacht slipped info overdrive, 
on the way back to Algol One and 
a girl named Betta. 




There was a good reason why no space pilot 
ia his right mind signed up for a Jovium flight; 
you were handed four trips, and each one was a— 

SUICIDE RUN 



f 



THE GRAVITY SHIELD 
was failing. Fip Largess knew 
that without looking at the 
control panel. The cabin lights 
grew dim. And his arm reaching 



for the automatic pilot suddenlyweighed sixty pounds. 

"Oh God/' he groaned, "not over 
Jupiter." 

Death, he had once said in a tav


ern with foolish bravado, is the 
same regardless of how it comes. 
But not here, not so far, far from 
the sun, not in' swirling seas of methane, not in the dark, brutally 
cold maws of the fifth planet. 

Four G's. His head toppled forward onto his chest like a hundredpound boulder. The pressure shoved his guts out of place, bulged 
them against the wall of his belly, 
and his bladder let loose. 

And he was strangling. He wantted to draw a breath, he was struggling to draw a breath, but the 
pressure on his lungs was enormous. 
His heartbeat staggered in his eardrums. 



This was the crisis. This is what 
Freestone had meant. And how 
do you analyze the situation now? 
(This was not a question but a bitter reproach crossing Fip's mind 
like a meteor.) What's the answer? How are you superior to the 
scores of other men who've died 
here? Prove it now or forever — 

Largess was conscious but conscious only of losing consciousness. 
It was all a delirious muddle of 
present and past as the gravity 
hammered his brain to jelly. 

And then like a voice in the earphones: "Alert! The Patrol is on 
your trail! Dump cargo!" 

And then the shrill inner com

mand, "Push the cargo release! 
Dump cargo." 

★ ★ ★ 
AND THEN AFTER ALL the 
J C* evidence was in and the counter-arguments had been made, Fip 
Largess arose to face the judge. 

It was an old twenty-first century room, with the computer and 
defense and prosecution programmers on one side, the conventional 
jury box on the other side, and the 
re-enactment screen in the rear. 
The room was windowless and the 
ceiling smelled of freshly painted 
luminescence. 

Martha pressed his hand reassuringly as he stood up. If she felt 
any twinges of shame for her husband, the billions of viewers on 
Earth and Mars could not readily 
find it in the loyal smile and ambiguous grey-eyed expression she 
projected at her man. 

His face, however, was a pale 
mask of anxiety. , 

"Fip Largess," said the judge, 
"this court is ready to announce its 
findings. You have been accused 
of three separate offenses. One, 
the illegal possession of the drug 
Ubertasia. Two, the illegal transport 
of th'is same drug. And three, the 
illegal destruction of said drug. 

"Specifically, you were apprehended while piloting a private 
ship within the twelve-thousand 



mile limit of Earth. Prosecution 
contends that your ship carried an 
estimated one-million grams of 
Ubertasia which you obtained 
through an unlicensed source on 
Mars. Prosecution further contends 
that just before the customs patrol 
boarded your ship, you disposed of 
the entire cargo through your ship's 
reactor tubes, in an effort to destroy the evidence." 

The judge paused, conscious of 
the drama in his words. Fip's 
eyes darted at the ten rows of live 
spectators. Their uniformly stern 
expressions bore a demand as readable as placards with the words: 
GUILTY, CONVICT HIM. The 
sternest expression, it seemed to 
Largess, was the one worn by his 
wife's own brother, Rodney Gait. 
It blazed with ill-concealed hatred 
for a brother-in-law who had 
brought disgrace on the family* 
and it read: GIVE HIM THE 
MAXIMUM. 

"Largess," the judge resumed, 
"this crime has a very old and dishonorable label, that of smuggling. 
And the court finds you guilty on 
all three counts. Before I pass 
sentence on you, is there anything 
you wish to say?" 

Fip drew himself erect to his 
full five-foot eleven stature. His 
slim, bony body trembled imperceptibly as he spoke. 

"Yes, your honor, I would like 



SUICIDE RUN 



• 69 



to say that I regard my actions 
as a service to humanity rather 
than a crime. We all know the 
properties of Ubertasia; we know 
that you have to use it if you want 
children. And I hope nobody's forgotten why you have to use it in 
this day and age." 

The physical tremolo transferred 
from Fip's body to his voice. He 
caught sight of Martha's anguished 
warning, but his own emotional 
momentum was too great to be 
shunted. 

"It's because of this damned nuclear economy of ours," he exploded. "Everything in the world run 
by atomic energy. It's flooded the 
planet with radioactivity. That's 
why two-thirds of the people are 
sterile ..." 
The judge's gavel began to 
und. 

"That's why they have to use 
if they want children. And furthermore, who controls the supply? 
Who holds the monoply? Who's 
created a false scarcity so that 
people could be kept in line? You 
know who - - this blessed government of ours!" 

The bailiff and three guards converged on the prisoner. 

"Everyone on Mars knows 
there's no real scarcity. So what if 
I made a little money giving people what they had every right 

to!" «•-••;'< 



A hand cracked down on the 
prisoner's mouth. When it was removed Largess remained silent, as 
a trickle of blood formed at one 
corner of his mouth. 

Court atmosphere was upset. The 
judge struggled to . regain his judicial calm. "This is neither the time 
nor place for a political harangue, 
Mr. Largess. The people of Earth, 
who have continued faith in our 
government's Equal Distribution 
Act, want to see justice done in 
this case. 

"You are sentenced to exile from 
Earth for a period of ten years. 
Your pilot's, license is hereby revoked. And you are fined the sum 
of ten thousand solars." 

The exile, Fip thought, will be 
harder on Martha than me. As 
for the license, nobody cares about 
that in frontier country. But the 
money. 

"Your honor, I don't have that 
amount of money. I don't have 
that amount of money." 

"Very well. Colonial servitude 
for a period of seven years on 
Venus. Is that your preference?" 

Largess saw his wife walk with 
swift, fluttering steps to the spectator's section where her brother 
sat. He saw Rodney Gait shake 
his head, with a pursed-lip expression; he saw Martha's hands move 
imploringly. Then, later, the worst 
part of Fip's sentence, a humilia

tion the judge could not have devised more perfectly. 

"I'll pay your fine, Largess." 
Gait bit off his words harshly. 
"I'll pay it for Martha's sake. But 
you know what I think of you, 
Largess." 

★ ★ ★ 

LARGESS DREW A BREATH. 
His chest, his ribs, his shoulders felt crushed like a miner 
buried in a landslide. He lay on 
the harsh, uncushioned deck of the 
cabin. Blood and fevered consciousness flowed back into his 
brain. 

"Ship," he thought frantically. 
"What's happening? Up or down?" 

He rolled his head on the deck 
so that he could view the control 
panel. His left ear was smashed 
flat by the weight. It seemed for 
a moment that his neck would twist 
apart. But at last his eyes, burning in their sockets like molten 
lead, focused on the panel. 

"Ascending at about thirty feet 
a second. Descending at about 
thirty feet a second." Fip closed 
his eyelids with immense effort. 

"Oh Lord, we'll crash." 

And Largess lay on the deck 
and imagined how the end would 
come. The ship would hang in 
mid-air. No, there was no sense 
calling it mid-air, that stream of 
bromines and flourines whipping 
around the surface at nine-hun


VE TALES 

dred miles an hour that we call 
Jupiter's atmosphere. The ship 
would hang there in mid-stream, a 
few meters above the surface, until a solid mass of something - rocklike - - came crashing against 
the hull. 

Or sheer friction alone would do 
the trick in a few hours. Or a 
downdraft that the automatic 
couldn't correct for. There were 
lots of ways. Because machines 
were stupid. They can't think. All 
they can do is do what they're told. 
When something new comes up 
they're helpless. And they can't 
fight. They don't know how to 
battle a planet that's out to get 
you. Only man can . . . 

Largess sobbed, "Oh Christ, if I 
could only get at those controls!" 

And then for the first time he 
made an effort to think: What has 
happened? How did it happen? * 
★ ★ ★ 

UTT'S A COMBINATION of 
many things," he told Martha. 
"First of all, it's the Depression. 
There just aren't any jobs opening 
up. And all those millions of unemployed. Of which I'm just one." 

"With this one big difference," 
said his wife quietly. "They're all 
drawing unemployment benefits. 
And we can't." 

Fip turned his back on her. He 
faced the single picture window 
looking out across the ruddy des


SUICIDE RUN 



7i 



ert landscape, marked by a scattering of semi-sphere hermetic huts 
similar to their own. 

"Are you throwing that up to 
me again?" he said wearily. 

Martha went to him and put her 
arm around his shoulders. "Oh 
darling, no, no, no, I'm not bringing that up. I didn't mean that. 
It's just that our situation is so 
desperate, and we have no resources." 

She slid in front; of him without 
removing her arms. "And you're 
such an expert pilot and astrogater and transport man. Surely there 
must be a lot of companies that 
can use you? Don't you think?" 

Martha had been a very beautiful girl when they first married. 
Her hair was long and brown and 
free-flowing, not cut wig-fashion 
like so many of the women who expected to lose their hair because 
of radiation. Martha had never lost 
her hair, but the prematurely 
white stands predominated; she 
refused to dye her hair. And the 
attrition of their exile from Earth 
!», - synthetic foods, wrong gravity, 
lack of natural sunshine, isolation, 
poverty - - had worn away at her 
features, giving them an excessively 
fragile pallor which her husband 
found heartbreakingly sad. 

"You know what kind of a reputation I have now. That's really 
the hardest thing I have to buck. 



I don't think I'll ever be able to 
find a legitimate job again." 

Martha began to sob. "Oh, Fip. 
What'll we do?" 

She pressed her body against his 
for comfort, and a new sense of urgency and despair filled Largess as 
he felt the firm, unyielding bulgeat her waist, and thought of the 
child that would be born to them in 
two more months. 

"I can only see three alternatives," Largess said in a flat mechanical voice, stripped of hope. 
"I can go back to my old line - - " 

"Never do that," Martha said 
with fright in her eyes. 

"I know you wouldn't want me 
to but at least we can make some 
good money." 

"Never do that. You'll be caught 
again. I'd never see you again in 
my whole life. I couldn't bear 
that." 

Largess caressed her long hair 
"We'll rule that one out. But darling, you have to see this situation 
as it is. I've tried for seven months 
to line something up, something 
legitimate. I'm licked. I don't 
know where our next solar's coming from." 

"Well, what are the other alternatives? To sell yourself into voluntary indenture? I'd never agree to 
that!" Martha went to the supply 
cabinet and took out a food packet 
and began opening it with agitat


>j2 IlVlAVjllNAl 

ed, fumbling gestures. 

"I could get enough to send you 
back to Earth." 

"I don't want to be separated 
from you." 

"You would have enough to get 
you through the next year or so. 
You'd be able to find a job, maybe 
find some other guy. Make a fresh 
start of your life." 

"You would need my written 
consent for colonial indenture and 
I'd never give it. Believe me, Fip, 
I never would. Here, sit down and 
eat." 

"Aren't you going to eat something with me?" 

"I'm not hungry; I just ate 
something." 

Largess seized his wife in a 
frenzy. "Liar!" 

"What's the third alternative, 
Fip? You said there were three." 

"I hate this one worse than the 
other two, by far." His eyes flicked at Deimos rising over the horizon. "I'll go to your brother. I'll 
go to Ganymede and ask him for 
a job." 

Hope sprang into his wife's face. 
"Oh, but that's a wonderful idea! 
I've wanted to suggest it a hundred times in the past month." 

"You realize how much he hates 
me, Martha. He'll probably turn 
me down flat." 

"No he won't. He'll see that you 
get a good job with Jovium Trans


VE TALES 

port. I'm sure of it." Martha 
hesitated. "Only promise me one 
thing." 

"What's, that?" 

"Oh, it's silly even to think of 
it. Rodney would never suggest 
it and you'd never take it. I mean, 
you know, the Jupiter run." 
★ ★ ★ 

WHAT HAPPENED? That 
was simple. The gravity 
shield failed and suddenly he 
weighed four times as he did on 
Earth. And there he lay, flat 
on his back with eight or ten 
broken ribs, and the salt taste of 
blood in his mouth, and each 
breath like a blow torch in his 
lungs. 

And Jupiter waiting impatiently to swallow him up. 

How did it happen? Well, Freestone had warned him to be careful on the takeoff. You couldn't 
accelerate too fast or the cargo 
would blow. So you had to start 
up slow, no faster than a freight 
elevator. And that took ' power, 
maximum pow*er, all the power that 
the ship's reactor ^ could deliver. 
Because you have to use all the directional rockets at once. You have 
to blast in every direction to hold 
the ship steady: lateral, dorsal, 
ventral. You have to lock your 
boat in the sky; with the faintest, 
almost imperceptible plurality of 
thrust going to your ventrals. And 



SUICIDE RUN 



73 



your ship eases upward. 

But that takes all the power you 
have got when Jupiter's involved. 
And what's left for the shield? 
Nothing. And after all, a gravity 
shield needs almost a quarter of 
the reactor's output. You don't 
erect a halo of energy outside 
your hull and scramble the basic 
cohesive force of the universe with 
a few spare atoms, you know. 

"Well, then, let's give the shield 
what it needs. Let's divert energy 
from the rockets — just enough to 
cancel Jupiter's gravity." 

A flush of excitement went 
through his mind, then cooled. 

"If I jolt the cargo, if I accelerate or decellerate too fast, I'm finished. If I cut the rockets evenly, 
then I'm right where I started 
before takeoff: on the surface of 
Jupiter. 

"But at least I'll get rid of the 
gravity. I'll be able to think. I'll 
be able to move." 

Largess made an effort to move, 
to slide his body towards the manual controls,. The pressure made it 
impossible. He was in agony. His 
belly muscles constricted in a sob, 
and his voice sounded in a tiny, 
scratching whine. 
; "It's killing me." 

★ ★ ★ 

TVODNEY GALT LOOKED at 
the visitor's screen, which 
had just buzzed, and hated what 



he saw. His first impulse was to be 
"not in" to his brother-in-law. 
Then he realized that this was impractical. Only last week Gait had 
released his own receptionist in a 
new economy wave demanded by 
the home office. 

Gait flicked on the two-way 
and said, "Largess, I don't want to 
see you." 

"Give me a minute, Gait. It's 
urgent." ' 

"I've no more money to give 
you, if that's what you want." 

"It's not money; it's not a loan 
I want. Please, this affects Martha as much as it does me." 

Gait scowled into the screen. 
"You bastard. You know how to 
hit where it hurts." He pressed a 
button and the office door swung 
open. 

"I warn you," he said, starting a 
recording machine at his desk, 
"that I'm .making a record of this 
conversation. You'd better not try 
to blackmail me through my sister. 
'Do you understand?" 

Largess stood in a gaunt, despairingly relaxed posture just inside the doorway, his face screwed 
incredulously. 

"Look, Gait, it's pretty damn 
hard for me to come to you and 
ask you for any favors, but I'm a 
man with a gun in my back. I 
need a job." 

Gait sat motionless for a few 



74 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



seconds, then tilted his chair back 
and began to laugh. It was a forced, 
artificial laugh. Abruptly he stopped. He saw that a signal button, 
one of twenty mounted in rows on 
a •wall mural of the planet Jupiter, 
had flared into life, a bright ruby 
jewel of light. 

His manner changed. He stared 
listlessly for a moment at the 
button, then returned his gaze to 
Largess. 

"We haven't any jobs open at 
the present time. And if we had, 
I don't think I could recommend 
you to any of our departments." 

"Yes, yes, I know. My criminal 
record. But Gait, you have to 
help me. I'm trying to stay legitimate, but all the doors are closed 
to me. I can't find work. We're 
facing ... I don't know what . . . 
starvation, servitude. Gait, you 
don't know how tough it's been on 
Mars." 

"I can't do anything for you." 

"My wife is expecting a child." 

"On smuggled Ubertasia?" 

Largess stood silent and stunned. 
"That's a low blow, Gait." 

Rodney Gait wanted to recall 
the words, wanted them unsaid. 
He pressed his teeth against his 
tongue. "Look," he said finally, 
"I can let you have a few hundred." 

"I don't want a loan. I want a 
job. A legitimate job." 



"Damn it, Largess, this is a depression. There aren't any jobs. 
Even if I wanted to help you, I 
couldn't. We're running in the red. 
_ We've had to let half of our office 
staff go. We've had to close down 
our refinery on Callish. Where 
do you think I'm going to find you 
a job?" 
"Piloting." 

"Don't be silly. Your license 
was revoked." 

"So I can't touch down on Earth. 
What difference does that make 
out here?" 

Gait drummed his fingers uneasily. "What are you driving at?" 

"I want the Jovium run." For 
the first time Largess stared levelly 
at his brother-in-law. 

Gait stood up brusquely. "Out 
of the question." 

Largess leaned across his desk. 

"Don't tell me you've had*" to 
shut down that part of the business, because I know different. 
Earth is buying every ounce of 
Jovium you can produce. They're 
crying for it; they've got to have 
it. It's the only hundred per cent 
radiation insulator, and they're 
paying a fantastic premium. I want 
the Jovium run." 

Gait shook his head. "That run 
is absolute suicide. One out of every two trips is fatal." 

"I know that. I know. that. But 
you're paying your pilots fifteen 



SUICIDE RUN 



75 



hundred a trip. I need that money." 

"You fool. You stupid fool. Go 
back to smuggling. You'll find the 
odds are much better. Didn't you 
see that red light flash on a minute 
ago? See it on the wall there?" 
Gait strode over to the wall and 
touched the light. "Know what 
it means? That button tells me 
that another transport just blew 
up on the surface of Jupiter. And 
along with it went another wise 
guy just like you who thought he 
could beat the odds." 

"I'll take the chance. One trip 
is all I need." 

"That's what they all say," Gait 
said with a bitter smile. "But you 
see, the company doesn't hire for 
one trip. You sign up for four 
trips or none at all. And you 
make one right after the other. 
And let me repeat, we average one 
blow-up for every two trips." 

"That part doesn't interest me. 
How many trips are you allowed 
to make in one day?" 

Gait smiled as at a child's foolishness. "The company doesn't 
care. All four, if you're physically 
able." 

"And what do you give the guy 
who makes four trips?" 

"Bonus of five thousand. Elev"^n thousand altogether." 

"All right," said Largess loudly, 
"sign me up. All I ask is one 
thing. I want you to keep all the 



other men out of my way. I'll 
be busy and I don't want to worry 
about traffic lanes." 

"That's hardly necessary, Largess. Right at the moment, there 
are no other pilots." 

Largess swallowed hard. "All 
right," he repeated. "Sign me up." 

Gait looked abashed. His manner softened. "No/ Largess, you 
don't know what you're asking for. 
I'd hate to tell you how few men 
have actually made four trips." 

"How many?" 

"Two. One is in a hospital on 
Earth — permanent invalid." 
"The other?" 

"Here on Ganymede somewhere." 

"Then it can be done." 

"I couldn't sign you up for a 
thing like this; I'll be ..." 

"Murdering your sister's husband?" Largess supplied. "Well, 
you would like to see me out of the 
way, wouldn't you? Admit it." 

"Not this way. I hate your guts, 
but this is something else again." 

"How about survivor's benefits? 
I don't suppose there's any insurance on this game." 

"The widow gets whatever the 
pilot would have earned," Gait 
said grimly. 

"Fine," said Largess, "then no 
one can lose, can they? Get out 
the contract and stop this sentimental sham."

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



npHE FREE FALL tavern was 
located on the outermost ring 
of Ganymede City, near the secondary airlock. The contoured bar 
stood in front of the rear wall, 
which was actually not a wall but 
the shell of the city's transparent 
dome. Through the entire artificial 
twenty-four hour day, some portion of Jupiter was visible at the 
bar. Occasionally, the entire mother planet, a beautifully tinted aqua 
globe with green, brown, yellow 
and gray horizontal stripes filled the sky like a delicate oriental 
screen. Four other, moons of Jupiter's twelve were visible playing 
about like shy fire-flies in an everchanging hide-and-seek. 

Appropriately, the Free Fall 
tavern operated by special license 
on one-half Earth gravity. 

"I admire your view," said Largess to the proprietor. "It's the 
kind of thing you can stare at by 
the hour." 

The man behind the bar grunted. It was months since he had 
heard an original comment on Jupiter. 

"It seems to change constantly. 
The color is never quite the same 
from one minute to the next. Any 
idea why?" 

"Most customers find, it interesting. What'll you have?" 

"A few straightforward answers," 
said Largess, deciding to drop the 



casual approach. "Tomorrow I have 
to go down to that monstrosity." 

"Worse luck for you," said the 
proprietor, drawing away to busy 
himself with glass polishing. 

"I need your help. You're 
Freestone, aren't you. Please. 
You're the only man who can help 
me." 

"I'm Freestone." 

Largess offered his hand but 
Freestone dug both gloved hands 
into his jacket. 

"You made four trips on the Jovium run." 

"Gait talks too much." 

"I'm going down tomorrow. 
What is there I have to know?" 

"They gave you the summary 
of all the other pilots' experience, 
didn't they?" 

"Yes, but it doesn't add up to 
anything. Ninety-nine per cent 
got themselves killed. You're part 
of the remaining one pe,r cent. Tell 
me, how did you survive four 
trips?" 

Freestone leaned -across the barspeaking softly. "Others have asked me that question. Others just 
like you, lads getting ready for the 
trip they think will make them 
their fortune. Solve all their financial problems." He looked far 
away at Jupiter. "Well, in a way 
it does." 

"What's the secret?" 

"There is. no secret. I've told 



SUICIDE RUN 



77 



the same thing to the others that 
I'm about to tell you now. It's 
a blow-up one way or gravity death 
the other. You just have to strike 
a happy medium." 

"What instrument readings did 
you have? You can certainly tell 
me that." 

"It's never the same. Each trip 
was different." 

Largess flared angrily. "You 
mean, you were the only one smart 
enough to work it out. You figured it out and you let all the others die their own way. You — " 

"No." Freestone suddenly leaped over the bar. Half gravity. 

He was a small man, almost a 
dwarf. Even at that he seemed to 
be wearing metal stilts. With a 
quick, dramatic gesture he removed 
his jacket. Metal rods extended 
from each shoulder. "You see, 
mister, I was the only person who 
tried it without his own arms and 
legs. The third and fourth time, 
that is." 

★ ★ ★ 

RODNEY GALT WAS on hand 
the next morning to see him 
off. "You are going to your death. 
I don't suppose I can harbor this 
grievance any longer." 

"You know, some day some man 
is going to dope this out," Largess 
said with a carefree shrug. 

Jupiter grew as Largess took off. 
It was no longer a giant wheel 



in space; it was all of space, and 
it was down. The ship descended 
on automatic, into a whirlpool of 
energy and matter. Largess switched on the radio, but only briefly. 
The clamor of outraged electrons, 
roared through the loudspeaker in 
a voice that forbade any communication with Ganymede. 

There was no special place to 
land. ("Indeed," thought Largess, 
"there is no such thing as land.") 
He hovered his ship a few meters 
above the seething liquid surface, 
locking vertical position. He 
opened the cargo hold occupying 
the reserve fuel tanks and released 
the two carbon terminals. These 
descended below the surface and 
the electrolysis began. 

Simple process, he thought, fully 
automatic. Jovium is a liquid at 
Jupiter pressure and temperature. 
We syphon it up. 

The cargo meter registered furl. 
Largess retracted the terminals, 
closed the hold. 

"Now up we go, slowly." He 
blasted away with all rockets, and 
the ship climbed slowly. 

The gravity shield began to fail. 
Four G's. He lay crushed to the 
deck. 

It seemed that he was losing 
consciousness a second time. Gravity death. He recognized the symptoms. It seemed to him that his 
downfall had begun not here but 



78 

elsewhere, with an earphoned 
warning: Alert! The Patrol is on 
your trail! Dump cargo! 

Hectic, life jumbled his thoughts. 

"Ubertasia! They'll "never catch 
me with it in my ship! Out with 
it through the tubes L" 

He pressed the jettison button. 

Out into space it went; out went 
the incriminating evidence. - , 

But that was then, not now. Now 
he was on the deck, and he weighed 
as much as the Earth itself. But 
Largess could see the cargo jettison half an arm's length away. 

If he could reach it. If he could 
dump the cargo. He tried to slide 
forward, but the weight was too 
much for his breast stroke motion 
of arms and legs. Then-he discovered he could roll. He smashed his 
nose and other ear to pulp before 
his body halted against the instrument panel. 

Then he cried in renewed chagrin. All rockets were blasting. 
He could not open the cargo jettison. 

In "his despair he had another 
thought. In his smuggling days, 
when he dumped cargo, it was an 
open door proposition. That left 
the goods floating around intact in 
space - - evidence that could be 
picked up by the authorities. 

Through the rockets, then. What 
might happen? A blow-up? Death 
was far more certain as matters 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



stood. If, on the other hand, he 
could get rid of the volatile cargo, 
he could cut the lateral and dorsal 
rockets and the gravity shield 
could again function. And without 
Jovium to worry about, he could 
accelerate normally. So he'd land 
on Ganymede without cargo - - a 
failure. At least he'd be alive. 

Rodney Gait's eyes could not remain fixed on the paperwork. His 
gaze kept stealing from his desk to 
the panel of red lights superimposed on the Jupiter mural, 
the lights that meant life or death 
on the Jovium run. 

When the desk phone buzzed, a 
tremor went through him. He picked up the receiver without taking 
his eyes from the mural. 

"Mars collect?" he repeated 
dumbly after the operator. He 
frowned in puzzlement. Who could 
that be? Certainly not a business 
call. Then his jaw set grimly. "All 
right, operator. I'll accept the 
can." 

"Rod?" It was JVIartha's anxious 
voice, on recording. "Has Fip been 
in to see you? He left here a week 
ago. He was going to see you 
about a job. Promised to let me 
know right away, but I haven't 
heard from him. Rod, were you 
able to help him?" 

Gait rubbed his forehead in anguish. How could he answer his 
sister? 'Yes, dear, he was in and I 



SUICIDE RUN 



79 



sent him to his death.' He sat at 
his desk in mute torment. 

"Have you a reply, sir?" said 
the operator. "Your message will 
take thirty-one minutes to reach 
Mars." 

Gait decided. He would tell 
Martha the truth, but not the 
whole truth. The truth, as of now. 
And by the time his voice reached 
Mars . . . ? 

"Wonderful to hear from you, 
Martha! Yes, your husband was 
here and we signed him up at a 
very good salary. I am sending 
you an advance on his first paycheck. Fip is out on the job now. 
I imagine that's why you haven't 
heard from him." 

(Or ever will, he mentally concluded.)

* ' infinite exertion, he drew 
his hand up to the control panel. 
Heavy in his imagination as a railroad tie or a steel girder, his finger stubbed against the reserve 
fuel button. 

He was not out of pain ; his ribs 
were still cracked. His ears and 
nose were still mashed horribly. 
But the pressure was gone. The 
gravity shield was again functioning. As Largess staggered to the 
pilot seat, the dials, meters and 
gauges told him an incredible story. 
All rockets were still blasting 



away, but amazingly, they were 
using only half the reactor potential. 

It was the Jovium that made the 
difference. Not only an insulator 
of reactors, but a newly discovered 
power source flowed through the 
blazing rocket tubes. 

The ship was ascending. 

Largess seized the manual controls, prepared to accelerate. "I'd 
better not take the chance," he 
thought grimly. "There's still 
plenty of Jovium left in the tanks." 

When he had gained a height of 
a thousand miles, the slow way, he 
stopped jettisoning cargo. 

He would land on Ganymede 
with a third of a tank of Jovium. 
He could excuse that on the 
grounds of inexperience in loading. 

Abruptly, Fip Largess saw the 
possibilities. A safe, low-risk technique of hauling Jovium. An abundance of Jovium for Earth's reactors. An end to escaped radiation. 
And end to sterility from radiation. 

Largess was dazzled by the vision. Then the picture clouded over 
slightly. "Wait a minute. I'd better not tell Gait right away. Not 
if I want my four-trip bonus. Why 
should the company pay a premium when there's no more risk?" 

The domed city of Ganymede 
loomed below. He circled for a 
landing. 

THE END 



It would take more than two decades to 
reach Sirius. For the long voyage everyone on 
board was put to sleep. Everyone except the — 

Starship Saboteur 



<ob ^itverberfy 



THE STARSHIP ALTAIR 
moved quietly through the 
dark night of space, nudging 
forward across the light-years between Earth and Sirius. 

In the Suspension Hold on the 
ship's fourth level, Rex Holden 
stirred uneasily in his fluid bath, 
stretched and murmured in his 
sleep. Like the other eighty-five 
men and women aboard, Holden 
had slept for nearly ten years 
while the Alt air travelled. The 
journey to Sirius - - eight light 
years - - took a starship twentyfive Terran years. The trip was 
not yet at midpoint. 

Inside Rex Holden's animationchamber, a shining needle flickered 
momentarily, then plunged downward into Holden's chest. 

Adrenalin coursed into the stilled aorta of Holden's heart. Dimly, 
he sensed that something was happening to him - - and then the 



cover of his chamber slid off and 
he sat up, coming slowly to full 
awareness. 

He knew what had happened. 
It was his turn to serve as watchman over the slumberers. Each 
member of the expedition spent 
four months of the journey awake, 
according to a predetermined schedule. The cybernetic controllers 
of the Suspension Hold governed 
the rotation; the newly-awakened 
watchman was supposed to find 
his predecessor and tell him to 
return to sleep for the rest of the 
voyage. „ 

Holden stretched lazily and 
shook his head to clear. away the 
fog of a decade-long slumber. It 
was hard, at first, to readjust to 
normal life after so many years 
of complete suspension of animation. It took time for unused arteries to begin carrying blood 
again, for long-rested synapses to 



80 



function and neurons to react. 
It - 
Holden heard the sudden startling sound of breaking glass at 
the far end of the Suspension 
Hold. The sound echoed in the 
silent ship for a moment, ringing 
violently in Holden's ears. He winced at the pain of noise in ears 
long used to silence. 

Squinting to see at such a great 
distance, he peered down toward 



the far end of the Suspension 
Hold. And then, not bothering to 
put on the robe that hung near 
his chamber, he began to run. 
■ "Holden! What are you - - " 
It was Jair. Leslie, another member of the expedition - - a squat, 
balding man whom Holden had 
come to dislike during the long 
sessions of pre-voyage indoctrination. He, too, had just awakened. He was naked, and his eyes 

i 



82 IMAGINATIVE TALES 



blinked uncertainly as he stared 
at Holden. 

"What's been going on here, 
Leslie?" Holden gestured at the 
scene around him. A figure lay 
face-down on the deck, blood 
trickling out from his gray-haired 
scalp. And an animation chamber 
had been broken open, and the 
■ already-darkening corpse of an expedition member was visible behind the shattered glass. 

Gray hair? That could only be 
Dard Ronholm, the ship's captain 
and supposedly Holden's predecessor as watchman. He was 
the only man aboard ship with 
gray hair - - and he was wearing 
a tunic, which indicated that he'd 
been awake for some time. 

"I just woke," Jair Leslie said. 
"I found Ronholm here busy 
breaking open poor Davis' chamber. Davis is dead, but I managed 
to lay Ronholm out before he 
could kill the rest of us." 

"How come you're awake?" 
Leslie asked, puzzled. 

"I'm the new watchman. I was 
just about to ask you the same 
question, Holden." 

"You're the new watchman? 
But - - " 

"Don't believe him, Holden!" 
The weak voice was that of Captain Ronholm. The old man 
rolled over and sat up, wiping 
blood from his battered forehead. 
"You're the watchman, Holden - 


my successor. Somehow Leslie woke 
up also, and I found him killing 
Davis. He hit me and - - " 

"Quiet!" Leslie snapped. "It's 
a lie, you old fool! You're the 
one who opened that chamber!" 

"I'm inclined to doubt that," 
Holden said quietly. "It's Captain Ronholm's word against 
yours, and your story doesn't 
stack up. If he wanted to kill us 
all, why did he wait until the 
day the new watchman was supposed to awaken? He had four 
months to do it undetected. 
He - - " 

"He went psycho waiting," 
Leslie said. "The old man's out of 
his mind! Can't you see that?" 

"No," Holden said. He turned 
away and started walking toward 
a booth in the center of the Suspension Hold. 

"Where are you going?" Leslie 
asked. His half-shout echoed 
weirdly in the giant room. 

"I'm going to wake the entire 
ship. We'll have to put this matter to a trial, Leslie." 

He reached for the lever that 
would awaken all eighty-two sleepers. 

i's^ET AWAY FROM THERE, 
Holden," Jair Leslie said 
menacingly. "Don't pull that 
thing." 

"Why not?" 

"Because I say so!" And Leslie 



STARSHIP SABOTEUR

sprang. 

His thick, long-armed body 
smashed into Holden, knocking 
him away from the lever. In selfdefense, Holden brought his knotted hands down on Leslie's balding head, jarring the smaller man. 
Leslie shook off the blow and 
smashed a fist into Holden's stomach. While Holden fought to recover his wind, Leslie grabbed 
him by one arm and swung him 
away from the lever, out toward 
the middle of the deck. 

There, Holden broke loose and 
stepped back. 

"I don't know what your game 
is, Leslie, but you won't get away 
with it." ' 

Leslie chuckled. "You can't 
stop me, Holden. No one can! 
If I can fool the cybe machines, 
I can beat you and all the rest 
of these idiots." He spat scornfully and circled Holden, ready 
to resume the fight. 

Holden edged foward and landed a solid right, but Leslie countered by clubbing down on the 
back of Holden's neck with the 
side of his fist. Holden staggered 
dizzily and tried to recover his 
balance, but his reflexes were still 
poor and he slipped to the ground. 
He waited for Leslie to administer 
the knockout blow, but to his 
surprise it never came. There was 
only the sound of laughter and 
bare feet running over the deck. 



"Come back here!" Holden 
yelled. 

Leslie laughed derisively. "Come 
find me," he called, and vanished 
into the dim recesses of the giant 
starship's upper levels. Holden 
leaned against the wall for a few 
seconds, recovering his strength. 

That was like Leslie, all right 
- - to kill a sleeping man, club 
down the old captain, then run 
away as soon as he got into an 
evenly-matched fight. Holden stared bitterly at the doorway through 
which the saboteur had vanished. 
Then he heard a groan from behind him, and remembered the 
fallen form of old Captain Ronholm. 

Ronholm's scalp was still bleeding, and he was barely conscious. 
Holden knelt and examined him. 
He was no medic, but it wasn't 
hard to tell that the old captain's 
skull was fractured. Nearby lay 
the length of metal pipe with 
which Leslie had struck down the 
old man and opened the animation 
chamber of the dead crewman. 

"Did he get away?" Ronholm 
murmured. 

"He ran like a scared rat," 
said Holden. "He had me beaten, 
but he was too yellow to stop and 
look. As soon as he knocked me 
down, he ran." 

"Where is he?" 

"Somewhere in the Upper levels. 
We'll hunt him down as soon as 



s 4 imaginat: 

you're taken care of." 

"Forget about me," Ronholm 
said. "I won't last long. Get him 
before he can do any damage to 
the ship." The old man sighed. 
"I suspected him all along, ' but 
I couldn't prove it. I knew - - " 
Suddenly Ronholm's eyes closed. 
Holden touched the old captain 
lightly on the shoulder, then shook 
his head. Ronholm was dead. 
That made two victims of- Leslie's 
villainy already. 

Ronholm had suspected him? 
Of what? And how had Leslie 
managed to awaken? The cybe 
controllers were pre-set to awaken 
only one crewman at a time - yet they had awakened both Leslie 
and Holden. Why? 

And where was Leslie now? 
What evil was he planning? 

Holden shook his head slowly 
and looked down at the body of 
the dead captain. This was too 
big a thing for him to handle 
alone. He walked back to the control booth in the center of the 
Suspension Hold and, after a moment's hesitation, pulled the 
switch that would bring the entire 
crew of the Alt air to life. 

Slowly, reluctantly, the crew of 
the Altair began to awaken. 

Holden watched as eighty-two 
animation chambers rolled open in 
response to the servo-mechanism 
he had activated; eighty- two hypodermics of adrenalin plunged 



VE TALES 

into eighty-two hearts, and eightytwo naked men and women climbed bewilderedly from the womblike security of their animation 
chambers into the uncertainty 
that faced them. 

"Where's the watchman?" someone asked. 

"Why were we awakened?" 

"Did something happen to the 
ship?" 

Holden cupped his hands and 
shouted, "I'm the watchman! 
Listen to me!" 

The members of the crew, still 
dazed and not fully awake, gathered slowly around him. Holden 
told them what had happened - how he had discovered Leslie in 
the act of breaking open an animation chamber, of their struggle, 
of the deaths of Davis and Captain Ronholm. 

"As watchman, I'm in charge," 
Holden said. "And since the captain's dead, I'll remain in charge. 
I've awakened all of you because 
it's necessary to track down this 
madman before he can do serious 
damage to the ship." 

"How far out are we?" someone 
asked. 

"Ten years. Not quite half-way." 

"And just how did Leslie and 
you both awaken?" asked a cybernetics technician. "The cybe 
controllers are set to wake one 
watchman at a time." 

"I know," Holden said. "But 



STARSHIP SABOTEUR 



he said something about haying 
fooled the cybes. I suspect he 
tampered with them before takeoff, arranged to be awakened out 
of turn once we were a good distance from Earth. It was just his 
bad luck that he picked the day 
I was set to wake and become 
watchman." 

He gestured toward the two 
bodies at the far end of the Suspension Hold. "Time's wasting," 
he said. "Kennedy, Lawrence, and 
Bronston, and Stein, come with 
me and we'll give the Captain and 
Davis space burial. And as for 
the rest of you - - " he pointed 
to Henry Larsen, assistant navigator - - "Hank, divide them up 
into search-parties and start" finecombing this ship. We've got to 
find Leslie - - right away!" 

THE BODIES OF DAVIS and 
Ronholm were committed to 
space in a short, efficient ceremony. 
Holden turned to the four men 
who had assisted him, after the 
airlock was closed on the two 
bodies. 

"That's that," he said. "Let's 
go find Larsen and get assignments for the searching parties." 

"Why do you think Leslie did 
what he did?" asked Kennedy, 
the cybernetics technician. "Just 
psycho?" 

"I don't know," replied Holden. 
"Captain Ronholm said something 



about suspecting him - - as if 
Leslie had been planning to do 
something all along." 

"The Captain didn't tell you 
anything else?" 

Holden shook his head. "He 
started to, but he died before he 
could get it out." They re-entered 
the Suspension Hold, where two 
men and a woman stood guard. 

"Any word about Leslie?" Holden asked. 

"The last we heard, Larsen had 
blanketed the ship without finding 
him," said the girl. She was Judy 
Foster, a biologist. Holden had 
dated her two or three times during pre-indoctrination, and he felt 
oddly relieved that she had remained here on guard instead of 
going with the searching parties. 
There was no telling what Leslie 
might do or where he could be 
found. » 

Holden reached for the ship's 
intercom. "Larsen?" he said. 
"Hank, this is Holden." 

"Hello, Rex," came the reply 
after a few moments. "No, we 
haven't found him yet. I've got 
twenty people on each level, going 
through the ship systematically. 
There's no sign of Leslie. None 
at all." 

Holden frowned. "Okay," he 
said. "Keep looking, I guess." 

"You don't think he went completely psycho and jumped out 
the airlock, do you?" 



86 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



"It isn't much like him," Holden said. "Keep looking, Hank." 
"Right." 

Holden put down the intercom 
and looked around the Hold. 
There were still too many unanswered questions, he thought. 
He didn't have enough information to act on. 

Judy Foster walked over to him. 
"You looked puzzled, Rex. What's 
on your mind?" 

"This whole business. I have 
the feeling I only know a fraction 
of the story. If only Captain Ronholm were - - " 

"He's dead now," Judy Foster 
reminded him. 

"I know." 

Then Kennedy got an idea. 
"Hey, Rex! I just remembered - there's a top-secret section in the 
information banks of the cybe 
controllers, for use only in emergency. Maybe there's something 
in there you ought to know." 

"Maybe there is," Holden said. 
"Take me there, will you?" 

^pHE CYBERNETIC Controllers of, the ship occupied one 
enormous room on_the Second 
Level. Holden stood in the middle 
of the room, feeling dwarfed by 
the immensity of the mechanical 
mind all around. Computers hummed and sang as they governed 
the motion of the ship, the balance 
of the atmosphere, the billion 



other details. 

"Okay," Holden said. "Find me 
this classified info, will you?" 

The cybe technician's fingers 
played over the console of the information banks. "Want it on 
vocal?" 

Holden nodded. 
"The following information is for 
use of the captain of this ship 
only, or, in the event of his death or 
incapacitation, his duly qualified 
successor." 

"I am the acting captain," Holden told the giant brain. 

Scanners clicked as the information was digested. Then: 
"Approved." 

"Okay," Holden said to Kennedy. "Feed me the whole Classified Info bank." 

"Coming up," the technician 
said. 

The controller proceeded to disgorge a vast supply of information 
obviously intended for the captain's ears alone - - information 
about managing the ship, handling 
the landing, controlling the crew 
members after the colony on Sirius was established. He noted it 
all carefully; now that Ronholm 
was dead, he would have to engrave these things' on his mind. 
But he still wasn't getting the information he wanted. 

Finally: "The Captain should 
also be aware of the existence 
and possible presence aboard his 



STARSHIP ! 

ship of members of an underground organization dedicated to 
the proposition that man must 
not colonize other worlds. Although this organization is known 
to exist, its leaders have not yet 
been apprehended, and in the interest of world security all information about it has been kept 
from the public. The members of 
your own crew will not be aware 
of the existence of this group, 
nor should they be told of it. 
"The - - " 

Suddenly, the intercom beeped. 

"Okay; shut it off," Holden 
said. "Dammit, that's what we 
needed to know!" He grabbed 
for the intercom. 

Hank Larsen's voice said. "Rex, 
we've just received word from 
Leslie." 

■ "Where is he?" 

"He's holed up in the drive unit, 
with the entrances completely sealed off. He orders us to turn the 
ship back toward Earth and return 
to sleep or he'll wreck the drive." 

"Tell him we're considering his 
order," Holden said. He glanced at 
the waiting cybernetic technician."They've found Leslie," he said. 
"He's a member of that secret 
group, all right." 

"What do we do now?" 

"I'm not sure," Holden said. 
"But I've got a sort of an idea 
; that may work." 



ABOTEUR 87 

THE ENTIRE CREW was assembled in the Suspension 
Hold when Holden and Kennedy 
returned. 

Larsen came up to him. "I didn't see any point in continuing the 
search, so I called everyone back 
here." 

"Okay, Hank. Good work, even 
if you couldn't rout him out." 

"How are we going to find him 
now? " 

"Are we going to turn back?" 
someone else asked. "If we go to 
sleep, he'll only kill us all anyway! 7 ' 

Holden nodded. "It's a tight 
situation. Leslie's a fanatic - - a 
member of a secret group so hushhush that not even we're supposed 
to know about it, for fear it'll, give 
space colonization a black eye. I 
just got the word from the info 
banks." 

"What's this?" Larsen asked. 

"An underground movement designed to blot out the star colonies," 
Holden said. "They work their way 
on board starships and gimmick 
the cybes so they'll wake up in 
mid-voyage. Then they just go down 
the row of chambers, killing everyone. Very efficient and very insane. It was just luck that Leslie 
timed his awakening badly." 

"So now he's changed plans and 
- is going to wreck the drive instead," 
Larsen said. "We're just as bad off 
as if he'd broken open our chambers." 



gg llVl/Wjli-i all 

"No we're not," said Holden. 
"We're still alive, as of now. And 
I think we can still flush him out 
of there." 

"How?" 

Holden ignored the question. "I 
want a radio operator," he said. 
"I've got a subspace call to make." 

Two hours later, Holden stood 
outside the massive duralloy doors 
of the drive unit. They were closed, 
tight closed, so that even a microbe 
would have trouble getting through. 
They couldn't be opened from the 
outside at all. And they were built 
securely, to shield the ship from 
radiation in the event of a pile 
blowup. 

Right now, Jair Leslie was 
crouching somewhere behind those 
doors, waiting for the answer to his 
ultimatum. He had given the Altair 
crew three hours to return to their 
chambers and re-enter suspended 
animation. Two of those hours remained. 

Sweat poured down Holden's 
face. He lifted the handmike to his 
lips and said, "Leslie? Leslie, can 
you hear me?" 

"I can hear you all right, Holden. You have an answer for me 
yet?" 

"Let me in, Leslie! Open the 
doors!" 

Leslie chuckled savagely. "You 
really must think I'm crazy, Holden. I'm not opening these doors 
until you're all safely back in 



V^E TALES 

dreamland." 

"You'd better open up," Holden 
said. He paused, then added, 
"Sunflower I" 

"What?" Leslie's tones reflected 
utter astonishment. 

"You heard me. Sunflower. Do 
I have to say more?" 

"Who are you?" Leslie asked. 

"How much identification do I 
need?" 

"But -- but -- you, Holden?" 
"Me. There are two of us aboard 
this ship." Holden chuckled. "We're 
so damned secret we fool each 
other. Only I've got orders that 
countermand yours. This ship is 
supposed to get through to Sirius - and we destroy it there!" 

"How can I trust you, Holden?" 
Leslie asked, suddenly suspicious. 

"Look here," Holden said impatiently. "I've already given adequate identification. But suppose 
I add that the name of our leader 
is Jak Henrix, and that the headquarters are in a tunnel under 
Chicago, and that - 
"All right," said Leslie. JTt's incredible, but I'll have to accept 
that. No outsider could possibly 
know what you've just told me/' 
There was the sound of relays 
turning over, and then the ponderous doors swung open. Holden 
stepped in. 

Leslie was sitting against a pylon, 
arms folded, holding the microphone. 



STARSHIP 

"Sunflower," Holden said. 

"Zeus," Leslie responded. He got 
up and crossed the floor toward 
Holden, smiling. "It's hard to believe that you're one. of us, Rex. 
But --" 

And then Holden hit him. 

His fist ripped into Leslie's jaw, 
snapping his head back. Holden 
saw the look of open-faced astonishment on Leslie's face, the accusation of betrayal. Following up his 
advantage, Holden smashed Leslie 
' to his knees with a right cross, 
then caught him by the throat, 
lifted him up, and hit him again. 
Leslie murmured something indistinctly and started to sag. Holden 
hit him again, just once, and the 
fanatic stretched out full length on 
the floor. 

TT OLDEN REACHED for the 
-*■ intercom. "All right, Hank - bring a couple of men and come on 
in." " 

A few moments later, Larsen, 
Judy Foster, Kennedy, and two or 
three other crewmen entered. 
"There he is," Holden said. "Take 
him upstairs and put him in a 
deep freeze - - and make sure 
there's no way he'll be able to get 
out of his chamber until we reach 
Sirius. We can figure out a punishment for him then." 

"But - - how did you get him to 
open up?" Larsen asked wonderingly. 



SABOTEUR 89 

Holden smiled. "The essential 
nature of a top-secret conspiracy 
is one that involves passwords - and when it's as top-secret as this 
one, you've got to trust anyone 
with the right password implicitly, 
or else not trust anyone. So I 
threw some key information at 
Leslie, and he let me in." 

"I don't understand," Judy 
Foster said. "Where'd you get the 
password? Are you 

"A member of the conspiracy? 
Hardly," Holden said. "But you 
have to remember that it's ten 
years since we left Earth, even if 
it only seems like a few hours for 
most of you. Leslie's little gang of 
conspirators couldn't stay secret 
forever. I called Earth via subradio, and they told me what I 
wanted to hear. The conspiracy 
was smashed four years ago. Someone high-up spilled the beans." 

"And they gave you all the information you needed," Judy said. 

Holden nodded. "Passwords, 
leaders, all of it. Leslie swallowed 
it faithfully." 

Larsen returned. "He's in deep 
freeze, Rex. Pickled well enough to 
stay under till we hit Sirius, at 
least." 

"Good. And now, I suggest you 
and the others get back to sleep. 
There's fifteen years before we hit 
Sirius, you know." 

Larsen said, "I'll spread the 
word."

"Oh - - one other thing." Holden 
added. He turned to Kennedy. "I'd 
like you to recompute the cybe 
controller's schedule for the watchmen. For the rest of the voyage, I 
think it's best if we have two crewmen awake at all times, instead of 
one." 

"I'll do that right away," Kennedy said. 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



Holden pointed to Judy Foster. 
"And - - as acting captain - - I'm 
appointing Miss Foster as my got 
watchman. Is that all right with 
you, Judy?" This was as good a 
time as any to get to know her, he 
thought 

She smiled. "I was just about to 
volunteer," she said. 

THE END 



IT has recently been pointed out 
that there is a certain futility 
in attempting to knock down the 
high-altitude bombers of the Strategic Air Command with ordinary 
jet fighters. Not only do the bombers fly too high, but they are more 
maneuverable ! 

This may seem contradictory, but 
it is true. It takes a jet fighter 
six or seven minutes to climb to 
fifty or sixty thousand feet, and 
when it gets to that altitude, not 
only is there merely enough fuel 
left for a single pass at the bomber, 
but the small wing surfaces do not 
permit the fighter to move and 
twist very effectively. 

Clearly it is no accident that the 
fighter pilots' days are numbered. 
Such a plane is a conception from 
the past. The terrific emphasis 
on the rocket interceptor missile 
program is calculated to produce 
results. 

The way to knock down a high


flying bomber is to use the sure 
and inevitable punching fist of 
ground-to-air guided missiles. 

Acceleration of maneuverability 
mean nothing to the rocket. As long 
as its motor has fuel it goes directly to its course. Let the target wiggle — there is no evasion. With this 
in mind, air defense is coming up 
with a series of interceptor rockets 
which will home on anything including optical sighting! 

Imagine yourself at seventy thousand feet in a bomber when the defense missiles start , coming up ! 
What do you do? You try for altitude and use your radar jamming 
hoping that they're radio-guided. 
Altitude though is the only real answer — and pretty soon you're so 
high you can't call your vehicle a 
bomber any more — it's a space ship. 
The science of air defense and attack is changing so fast you don't 
know what you are!

A click sounded in the tinyphone behind Lieutenant 
Kirk's left ear. The worried 
voice of Captain John Esk came 
down from the ship circling far 
above. "Tim?" 
"Yes, sir." 

"How's it going down there?" 

"We're doing fine, except for 
Johnson, who has severe nausea." 

Esk's snort came clearly through 
the phone. "I don't blame him for 
that. I'd have it too, if I was down 
there. How's the installation 
going?" 

"So-so. The boys have got the 
jaws of the trap installed. They're 
working on the bait." 

"Good." Esk sounded pleased. 
"Where are you personally?" 

"Watching the detectors. We've 
set them up just outside the lock 
of the life boat?" 

"Why don't you leave them inside the boat?" Esk sounded wor


ried now. 

"The steel hull cut down the 
range too much. If we left the detectors inside, they might be on us 
before we knew it." Both Esk and 
Kirk knew what they meant. 

"Don't let them slip up on your 
crew, Tim. That's the way the 
men of the third life boat went." 

"You don't have to remind me of 
it," Kirk said. "I remember. I 
was with the crew that brought 
back the bodies." Grimness appeared in his voice. 

"Have you - - have you - - " 
The captain hesitated. "Have you 
seen - - " „ 

"No," Tim Kirk said bluntly. 
"And what is more important, they 
haven't smelled us out." 

"Good!" Captain Esk sounded 
relieved. "Remember, if you sight 
one, you are to abandon the installation." 

"Glad to, sir. If - -"

"If what?" 

"If we have enough time," Tim 
commented. "Those things can 
move real fast, you know." 

"Damn it, you'll have enough 
time, if your detectors are operating properly. Those things radiate 
so heavily they can be picked up 
for miles. Their band is so broad 
you can't miss it. Are your detectors operating properly?" 



"I'm looking at them ri<?ht now.. 
The lights are green on all bands. 
Not a single red flicker - - " He 
ducked and swore as a small round 
object dropped from the huge tree 
above his head. 

"A drainer?" Esk demanded. 
"Have you picked one up?" : 

"No. It was a squirrel." 

"Did you say a squirrel?" Esk 
demanded. 



94 1JMAU1JNAJ 

"A small, furry animal that lives 
in trees, eats nuts, and drops them 
on the heads of people he doesn't 
like. On Earth, we would call 
him a squirrel." 

"What is he doing?" 

"Dropping nuts on us. Connaught has already got beaned. I'll 
bet they don't - - " Tim let his 
voice trail off. 

"You'll bet they don't what?" 
Esk asked. The captain was determined to leave no question unanswered. 

"That they don't like us humans. It's also possible that they 
may be acting as spies for the 
drainers," Tim said, lapsing' into 
fantasy. 

"Have you gone nuts down there 
in that jungle?" Acid ripped from 
the captain's Voice. 

"No, but I'm working on it. 
It would be a relief." Tim wiped 
sweat from his face and thought 
longingly of ice cubes tinkling in a 
tall glass. "Why do we want this 
damned planet anyhow? It's all 
jungle." 

"There's no more jungle on it 
than there was on Earth once," 
Esk retorted. "We want it because 
more millions of people than we 
can count need new lands. They 
call that population pressure, boy. 
If we can drain it off by opening 
Venus to colonization - - " 

"I know all that. I went to 



VE TALES 

school," Tim answered, with an 
injured air. "Why don't we all 
just stay home and kill off the 
surplus population by fighting 
wars, the way we used to do? It 
would be simpler than fighting 
drainers. Or we could stop 
breeding - - " 

"Stop breeding? Now I know 
you're nuts! Over and out," Esk 
said, breaking radio contact. 

Thunk went another nut in 
front of Tim. Looking up into the 
spreading branches of the huge tree 
under which the life boat was hidden, he saw a. sharp, furry face 
with two bright eyes looking down 
at him. "The drainers will get you 
too, if you don't watch out!" Tim 
threatened. He knew his threat 
was probably pointless. The squirrels and the drainers both existed 
on the same world. Any life form 
that existed on the same planet 
with the drainers had learned how 
to out-wit, out-run, or out-fight 
them. He stuck his head into the 
open lock and yelled,^ "Johnson! " 

The engineer's muffled voice 
came from the direction of the 
wash room. 

"Come out of there!" 

"I don't dare, Tim," Johnson 
protested. 

"There's nothing out here but 
squirrels and they're not dangerous 
if you're good at dodging. I have 
not seen a drainer. You watch the 



THE DRAINERS 



95 



detectors while I lend a hand installing the trap." 

"That wasn't what I meant," 
Johnson said. 

"Oh," Tim said with understanding. "You come anyhow. That's 
an order." 

The engineer, mingled white and 
red showing on his face appeared in the lock in response to 
the order. "Damn it, Tim, you 
know I have a sick stomach." 

"You stay here and watch these 
detectors," Kirk said, an ominous 
note in his voice. Leaving the engineer still protesting, he picked his 
way over the protruding roots of 
the big tree to the little glade on 
the other side of it where three 
men stripped to the waist were 
busy installing the trap. 

Connaught, the electronic technician, was finishing his adjustment of a six inch long rod surmounted by a quarter inch semicircle of copper ribbon. This was 
a transmitting aerial. It was also 
the bait of the trap. Below Connaught, Somer was very carefully 
adjusting something inside a heavy 
plastic box which held the jaws 
of the trap. McCabe was busy 
tamping dirt tight around one of 
the three stout steel legs which 
supported the entire device. 

Connaught and McCabe were 
very busy but out of the corners 



of their eyes, each was watching 
Somer. He was the hot man. 
If he made a mistake and let the 
plunger carry its small but virtually important load of radio-active 
mass into the matrix, a smart 
human being would drop whatever 
he was doing and would run like 
hell. A man could stand the radiations from this box at close range 
for perhaps thirty seconds. He 
might stand them for a minute. Two 
minutes were too many minutes. 

Back on Earth men had invent- • 
ed an ingenious way to destroy 
mosquitos. They had constructed 
a box with concave ends tapering 
inward. Inside this box they had 
mounted a supersonic generator 
which had imitated the mating call 
of the female. 

Male mosquitos had come from 
miles distant to investigate this 
luring summons. Sure that a love 
hungry female was inside, they had 
persisted until they had found one 
of the openings into the box. Once 
inside, they had eventually landed 
on the liquid that covered the bottom. Exit Mr. Mosquito. 

On Venus, this idea was being 
adapted in an effort to reduce the 
population of a life form infinitely more vicious and deadly than 
even malaria carrying anopheles 
- - the creatures called the drainers. 

The drainers didn't bite humans, 
they didn't infect them with a 



9 6 IMAGINA. 

deadly disease. Instead, they 
drained the energy from the human 
body. A man was walking along. 
He heard a thin, high piercing note 
but paid no attention to it. He 
felt a little tired. He sat down to 
rest for a few minutes. 

He never' got to his feet again. 
Instead his lifeless body, drained 
of all energy, slumped to the 
ground. 

Almost silent in motion, visible 
only as rising heat waves are visible, able to fly very rapidly, a 
life form that consisted of almost 
pure energy and - lived exclusively 
on this primal stuff, the drainers 
were a scourge that would stop 
all human colonization on the 
Veiled Plane.t, unless they could be 
eliminated. 

Careful investigation bought and 
paid for with human lives had disclosed that the drainers did not detect the presence of their prey by 
sound or smell. Instead, they were 
able to detect the presence of a 
living body by the radiations from 
it. 

The tiny aerial that Connaught 
was adjusting, and the compact 
transmitter under it, radiated on 
the same band of frequencies as 
the human body. This was the 
bait. Operating automatically 
fifty-nine minutes of every hour, 
it would attract every drainer that 
came within miles of it. Then it 



VE TALES 

would shut off. A plunger in the 
lower box would shove a tiny cube 
of metal home into its matrix. The 
result would not be an atomic explosion. No such devastating effect was needed. Instead the surrounding area would be bathed in 
a hell-hroth of red-hot particles 
and radiations. After one minute 
of this, the plunger would be withdrawn by its automatic machinery 
and the luring radiation would begin again. 

During that minute all the 
drainers in the vicinity would die. 
Every human hoped their death 
would be horrible. 

"Careful with that plunger," 
Tim said to Somer. At his words, 
Connaught and McCabe turned 
startled eyes toward the hot man. 

"You think I haven't got good 
sense?" Somer answered, with an 
injured tone of voice. 

During the fifty-nine minute 
period while the plunger was withdrawn, the trap could be approached with safety for inspection or 
necessary repairs. 

In time, these devices would 
clear the hotlands of Venus of their 
most evil and vicious life form. 

Connaught made a final adjustment of the transmitter and came 
down from the top of the short 
ladder he had been using. He sat 
on the lower rung and wiped sweat 
from his face. "Hot in this hell," 



THE DRAINERS

he said. He was a tall man with 
the face of a benevolent satyr. 

"Yeah, it is," Tim agreed. "How 
much longer?" 

"Maybe ten minutes for my 
job," Somer answered. 

"I can quit any time," McCabe 
said. "These legs will stand." 

"Mine is all finished," Connaught said. "We're on the air." 

"What's that?" Tim demanded. 
He felt his stomach muscles tighten and heard a snarl in his voice. 

CONNAUGHT'S FACE went 
white. "When you told Somer 
to be careful with that plunger, you 
distracted my attention. I closed the 
switch without noticing what I 
was doing. My God!" He ran up 
the ladder. Jerking open the cover 
of the transmitter, he rammed his 
hand into it. A switch clicked 
there. His legs were rubber limber 
as he came down the ladder. 

"I didn't think - - I didn't realize." Sweat was really pouring 
from his face now. 

"All you have done has been to 
sound the mess call for every 
drainer within miles, .and you've 
done it over a loudspeaker!" Tim 
said grimly. 

"I know it!" Connaught's right 
cheek had developed a tic. As he 
looked hastily around the glade, 
his eyes were those of a madman. 
Overhead the leaves of the jungle 



trees dripped with moisture. Thin 
shafts of sunlight filtered through 
to the ground. No twisting, shifting, darting mass of heat waves 
was visible. The four men listened 
until their ear drums popped. No 
zinging sound was in the air. "I 
guess they didn't hear my call," 
Connaught said. 

"Get busy on that plunger mechanism," Kirk said to Somer, who 
had stopped working. "We're 
clearing out of here as soon as you 
finish." 

"Maybe we ought to beat it now, 
while we can," Somer answered. 

"Johnson will warn us if there 
is any danger," Tim said. "Hey, 
Johnson!" There was no answer. 
- "That weak-stomached engineer 
had to go again," Tim Kirk said, 
swearing. "I'll go watch the detectors myself. I'll yell if they 
show red." Moving on the run, he 
headed back for the life boat that 
they were using for exploration of 
these jungles. "I'll flush that Johnson down the drain for leaving his job!" he thought. 

Johnson lay sprawled on the 
ground before the lock. He 
had made it to the wash room. But 
he hadn't made it back. During the 
period when he had been absent 
from the detectors something had 
come out of the jungle. 
It was still present. 
Tim Kirk caught a glimpse of a 



9 8 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



shifting maze of what "looked like 
heat waves hovering above the engineer's body. The drainers were 
jj not matter in any sense of the 
meaning of the word. They were 
energy creatures. Light waves 
passing through their strange 
bodies were distorted and twisted, resulting in a shifting, shimmering effect that was similar to a 
mirage. 

Had Connaught's inadvertent 
starting of the radio transmitter 
called this drainer out of the jungle or had it drifted by the ship 
in its eternal quest for the energy 
that was its life blood? It was 
here. Nothing else mattered. 

Kirk's first impulse was to try 
to dart past it and into the life 
boat. Nothing could be done for 
Johnson now, he knew. He checked this impulse. "Hey!" he called 
softly over his shoulder. 

Alarmed silence answered him 
from the glade tin the other side 
of the tree. Then . Connaught's 
voice, tense with sudden fear, came, 
"Is one coming?" 

"It's already here. It got Johnson." 

"The devil - - " Somer's startled exclamation had sudden pain in 
it. He and Johnson had been 
buddies. 

"Don't come running," Tim 
Kirk ordered. "It's between us and 
the ship." 



"Then we can't get aboard?" 
Connaught called. 

"Not as long as it's here." 
The silence in the glade became 
frantic. The thoughts passing 
through his mind were equally frantic. The impulse to run pounded 
in every muscle of his body. 

"How are we going to get into 
the boat?" McCabe called. 

"I've been thinking about that," 
Kirk answered. Why were his 
throat muscles so stiff he could 
hardly talk? Didn't he want to 
say these words? "I'm going to 
lure it that way." To his surprise, 
his left arm was capable of pointing. "It has fed now and is probably a little sluggish?" Where 
had this utterly false rationalization come from? "As soon as I get 
it out of the way, you head for the 
lock, fast." 

He could almost hear the thinking of the three men behind him. 
"What about you, Tim?" Connaught called. "How will you get 
back to the boat?" 

"You go to hell! This is an 
order. Obey it!" Was this his 
voice that was so unnaturally 
sharp? 

"Okay, if you say so," Connaught answered doubtfully. "But 
- - well - - " 

"What have you got on your 
mind?" 

"Goodbye, Tim," Connaught an


THE DRAINERS

swered. 

"You can go to hell twice!" Kirk 
shouted. He moved toward the life 
boat. The drainer was still hovering over Johnson's body. Having 
no ears, it could not detect vibrations in the human range. 

Why were his muscles suddenly 
as heavy as lead? Had gravity increased? A product of his. overworked imagination, the thought 
was silly and he knew it. Was 
something that was called population pressure back on Earth pulling 
at him with a weight that seemed 
to be tons? No! This was the 
pressure that was moving him toward the life boat and in the direction of sudden death. It was 
funny that such an intangible as 
population pressure could exert so 
much influence across millions of 
miles of space. Funny? He wasn't 
laughing. 

Since the drainers had no eyes 
but depended on other methods of 
perception instead, he could not 
say that the drainer ever saw him. 
But it sensed his presence. Darting upward from Johnson's body, 
it hovered fifteen feet in the air. 

■*IM FLED to the left. Once he 
released the impulses in those 
I leaden muscles, they exploded into 
I action. He ran like a madman, 
| like a man pursued by devils. JunI gle briars tore his legs. He did not 



feel the deep cuts they were inflicting. He ran headlong into a 
tree and hardly felt the impact. 

Why was he sitting on the 
ground? Why was his head reeling? The sight of the tree he had 
struck told him the reason. His 
head whirling, he got groggily to 
his feet. Where was the drainer? 
It should have overtaken him. He 
should be dead by now. Dead 
with Johnson, his body sprawled on 
the ground of Venus, every erg of 
energy sucked from it! 

"Maybe I am dead and don't 
know it!" he thought, then began 
looking around for his body. 
Abruptly, he stopped such thinking. That way lay madness. He 
saw the drainer. It had not left 
its position above the lock of the 
boat. 

"Come on, chase me!" he yelled. 

The drainer did not move. Yelling and waving his hands to attract 
its attention, he went closer. The 
drainer still did not move. He felt 
foolish and stupid. In his secret 
heart he knew he had been trying 
to act the. hero by getting it to 
chase him, thus risking his life to 
give the others a chance to get into 
the boat and escape. "You're a 
sham hero!" he thought. "Or 
aren't drainers dangerous?" 

The sight of Johnson's body lying on the ground told him how 
fallacious this conclusion was. 



100 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



"Connaught?" he called. 

There was no answer. Glancing 
toward the tripod supporting the 
trap, he could' not see the others. 
"Probably hiding in the jungle 
waiting for me to lure this thing 
out from in front of the lock," he 
thought. 

Tim picked up a stone and flung 
it at the drainer. The creature 
dodged expertly. The stone struck 
the hull of the boat, which rang 
with a hollow sound. As if stung 
by this challenge, the drainer 
moved forward. This time he did 
not have to tell himself to run. 

Ziiiiiiiinnnnnng ! 

His heels tore grooves in the 
ground as he came to a halt. The 
drainer was directly in front of 
him. It had overshot its target. He 
turned and fled blindly to the right. 
The knowledge and the fear of 
death were on him. 

TAiing! 

Again it was directly in front of 
him. 

He turned to the left and kept 
running. 

Zing! For the third time it 
blocked his path. Now he realized 
it was not overshooting its target 
but was deliberately playing with 
him in a cat and mouse fashion. 
Fully charged and not in need of 
additional energy, it was having 
fun with him. Its kind of fun! A 
few moments later he discovered 



that a purpose lay back of the socalled fun. By appearing in front 
of him if he tried to go in any 
other direction, it was moving him 
toward the trap. 

The dim thought was in his 
mind that at least the others had 
had their chance to reach the boat. 
He was glad about that. True, he 
had not heard the clang of the 
closing lock, but perhaps the noise 
he had made running had drowned 
that sound. 

Like an old-time cowboy in the 
old American west, the drainer 
herded Tim Kirk toward the trap 
the humans had built for its kind. 

Ahead, moving out of the jungle and into the glade, he caught 
a glimpse of Connaught. A drainer 
was herding him too. Then McCabe and Somer came into sight. 
Each had his almost invisible herdsman floating lazily, but hungrily, 
through the air above his head. 

"Somer!" Tim shouted. "Make 
a break and shove that plunger 
home!" 

This was a desperate hope. Or 
was it no hope at all? 

Somer turned a frightened face 
toward him. "Do you think I'm 
- crazy? Those radiations will kill 
a human too!" 

"It will kick out automatically in 
one minute. A man can stand the 
stuff that long!" 

Somer's frozen face showed n0 



THE DRAINERS 



101 



comprehension. Either he did not 
understand or he was too frozen 
with fear to make the attempt. 
Cursing, Tim leaped forward. His 
feet became tangled in the protruding roots of the big tree and he 
fell headlong. 

The drainer buzzed above -him. 
It had intelligence of a kind not 
comprehensible to a human, enough 
to enable it to understand that 
this victim had tried to escape. 
As Tim tried to rise to his feet,, 
e knew it was upon him. 
Claws rasped on back. Kirk 
anced toward the tree in time to 
see the squirrel come swiftly down 
the trunk. He knew it was not 
coming to help him, that it had no 
interest in him. Its sole motive 
lay in the fact that it hated drainers too. Long centuries of adaptation to life in these jungles had 
given the squirrel a weapon not 
only to implement its hate but to 
save its own life. Its tail lifted. 
Tim expected a burst of nauseous 
gas like that emitted by an Earth 
skunk. No gas came. So far as his 
eyes could tell, nothing happened. 
But he felt a sudden prickling of 
his skin and he knew that the 
squirrel, instead of releasing an 



odorous spray, ha'd discharged a 
flood of strong radiation. 
Zinging, the drainer fled. 
Tim leaped to his feet, dashed 
to the tripod, and shoved the 
plunger home. 

Violent flurries took place in the 
air around him as the radiations 
struck the energy drainers. 

"Run like hell!" Tim shouted. 
Fleeing from the deadly radiations, the drainers tried to run and 
succeeded in dying. The humans 
had better luck. They reached the 
life boat. 

Inside the little vessel, Tim 
shook his fist at the monstrous 
jungle and its equally evil and 
monstrous denizens. He hated 
drainers with a fury that knew no 
bounds. "That's for all of you!" 
he shouted. "All of you! Except 
that squirrel!" 

The little furry animal had 
learned how to lick the vicious 
energy sucking creatures of its 
native jungle. If it could learn how 
to do this, humans could too. Off 
on the next outward planet in 
space, the population pressure 
eased. Tim Kirk did not know or 
care about this. He was feeling 
a sudden fondness for the squirrel.

HUNGRY WORLD 

IQandaii Garrett 



MIKE RATH LAY on the 
floor of the back seat of the 
swamp tractor and kept his 
eyes closed. He didn't want the 
man who was watching him to 
know he was conscious, now that 
he had managed to free his hands 
and was working on his feet. So 
far, in the dark interior of the 
swamp tractor, the watcher hadn't 
even seen Mike's slight movements. 

The driver in the front seat 
said, "How much farther you 
wanta go, Sam?" 

The man in the back said: "A 
few more miles. We want to make 
sure this bird's body is never 
found. The boss said he doesn't 
want any slip-ups." 

Mike clenched his teeth in anger. 
No, Zamenkov wouldn't want any 
slip-ups. For over a year, now, 
Zamenkov had been ruling the colonists at Rigel City with an iron 
hand - - and he didn't want the 



Interstellar Colonial Commission to 
find out about it. 

Mike was a biologist. For three 
years, he and his wife had been 
out in the swamps and forests of 
Rigel VI, classifying and recording 
the characteristics of the alien 
plants and animals of the planet. 

He and Marsha had established a 
small base camp and taken supplies 
enough for three years. When they 
ran low, Mike had taken the jetcopter back to Rigel City -- and 
immediately found himself in a 
jam. 

He had been arrested by Zamenkov's police as soon as he climbed 
out of his copter,. He had tried to 
identify himself, but it had been 
obvious that they hadn't believed 
him. In spite of his identity card, 
they had taken him to Norman 
Zamenkov himself. 

Zamenkov was a great, broadshouldered, grossly fat man with 
pale skin and pale blond hair that 



102 



clung damply to his pink scalp. 
His blue eyes - - so light they almost looked white -- peered out 
from wreaths of flesh that surrounded them, giving him a piggish squint. 

"You claim you've been living 
in the jungles for three years, eh? 
That's impossible. The natives hate 
Earthman. They'd have killed you 
on sight." 

"But - - " 

Mike had tried to explain that 
the natives didn't kill an Earthman 
unless they were molested, but the 
harsh voice of Zamenkov had cut 
him off. 

"None of that; we know better. 



Now - - who are you?" 

"Michael Rath, as I told you. 
I'm a biologist, and - -" 

Zamenkov had reached out a 
hamlike hand and slapped Mike 
across the face. Bound though he 
was, Mike had tried to lunge at 
the fat swine who ruled Rigel City, 
but the guards had pushed him to 
the floor. 

"Don't lie," Zamenkov had said 
coldly. "I know you're an agent 
for the Interstellar Colonial Commission. Where is your ship hidden?" 

It hadn't done any good to try 
to tell Zemenkov that he didn't 
have a ship. The guards moved in 



103 



10 4 1M AlxUN A i 

and batted him around for an hour 
before they gave up. 

Finally, Zamenkov had said: 
"Never mind. It isn't worth it. 
We'll find his ship; interstellar 
drive energies can't be hidden from 
a Vidor detector." He waved a fat 
hand contemptuously. "Take him 
out in the 'swamp and get rid of 
him. We won't want his body around 
in case an ICC ship lands here." 

And now, here he was - - lying in 
the bottom of a swamp tractor 
while he waited for 'Zamenkov's 
men to kill him. 

Only he wasn't waiting hopelessly. They had bound him with 
heavy plasticords, but they'd made 
one little mistake. After they had 
carried him to the tractor, he had 
managed to slip a jungle knife out 
of his jacket. They had searched 
him for a gun, but they hadn't 
noticed the knife. 

And now he was almost free. 

"Pull her up," said the man who 
had been addressed as Sam. 

The turibomotor of the tractor 
hummed a little as the clutch was 
released and the vehicle rolled to 
a stop. 

The driver turned on a searchlight and pointed it off to one side. 
"How about that? There's a fairly 
deep pond, down that way. We 
can toss him in there, and the 
marshlobsters will have taken care 
of the corpse by tomorrow." 

"Good idea, Harry," Sam said. 



VE TALES 

"Let's go." 

Harry, the driver, climbed out 
of the front seat and came around 
to open the rear door. Sam reached 
down to lift Mike up from the floor. 

As the door opened, Mike exploded into action. He slammed his 
fist up into Sam's face and leaped 
out the door, bowling Harry over 
into the mud of the swamp. Then 
he took a long, diving leap into the 
waters of the shallow swamp pond. 

He hit the water in a flat dive, 
gliding across it, just underwater, 
on his own momentum. 

He came up for breath under 
the protection of a lush spread of 
heavy grass, his head hidden by the 
tall blades. Warily, he looked back 
at the tractor. 

Neither of the men was out of 
action. Harry was shouting and 
aiming the searchlight while Sam 
fired bolts of energy from his heatpistol at the spot where Mike had 
disappeared. The water boiled furiously for a second each time the 
searing rays touched it. After three 
or four shots, he stopped. 

"Play that light around, Harry. 
He still may have gotten away." 

Mike held his breath. He hoped 
they wouldn't start firing into the 
grass; he couldn't possibly stand 
up and run. 

And then his attention was attracted by a ripple in the water. 
It was only a dark bulge in the 
pond, but Mike recognized it for 



HUNGRY WORLD 



what it was --an aquasaur, a 
water-lizard. Like the Earth crocodile, it was viciously carnivorous, 
and, even worse, it could breathe 
both air and water. It had obviously been aroused by Mike's plunge 
into the swamp - - and it was coming straight for him! 

■ppOR A FEW SECONDS, Mike 
was not sure what to do. If he 
stood up to run, Zamenkov's men 
would shoot him - - but if he stayed 
crouched in the stagnant swamp 
water, the aquasaur would get him. 

But the matter was taken out 
of - his hands. Harry, guiding the 
spotlight, suddenly shouted, "There 
he is!" 

The heat-beam was pointed directly at the aquasaur's head. Almost instantly, two heat beams 
lashed out at the moving head of 
the monster. There was an odor 
of scorched flesh and a strangely 
human cry as the aquasaur vanished beneath the boiling water. 

Then there was silence for a moment. 

At last, Sam said: "Well, that 
got him. Come on -- let's go report back to Zamenkov." 

As the swamp tractor pulled 
away from the pond and slowed 
off into the distance, Mike pulled 
himself, dripping, from the reeds 
and stood up on a fairly firm section of ground. What was he to do 
now? His wife was several hundred 



miles away, running dangerously 
short of supplies. The native plants 
weren't edible, and she had no 
means of transportation, now that 
Zamenkov had confiscated Mike's 
'copter. 

He stood there indecisively for a 
moment - - and felt something probe 
at his back. He froze. He was able 
to recognize a spear-point when he 
felt one. 

There was a chattering hiss from 
behind him. It was, Mike knew, 
the sibilant language of the Rigellian natives. The being was saying, 
"If you value your life, Skyman, 
do not move." 

Skyman -- the native term for 
Earthman. Mike wished to heaven 
he was up in the sky right now, 
going back to Marsha in his jetcopter. 

"I will not move,", he hissed 
back. "I value my life as I respect 
yours." 

There was a slight lessening of 
the pressure of the spear against 
his back. "You speak our language 
well. I heard the odd barkings o£ 
those others as they spoke in your 
barbaric tongue. It is ^ueer that 
the same mouth can utter our own 
beautiful language as well." 

"I have lived with your people 
for a long time," Mike said. "I am 
the Hunter of Everything," 

Again the pressure lessened. 
"The Skyman Who Hunts All 
Animals? Ah. I have heard of 



io6 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



you - - if it is truly you. I would 
have slain you instantly if it had 
not been for the fact that I saw 
our enemies try to kill you with the 
Light That Burns." 

"Enemies? Why should the Skyman be our enemies?" 

"It is only in the last year that 
it is so," the Rigellian said. "These 
new rulers of the Skymen's village 
drove out all our people's women 
and enslaved the men for their 
mines." 

So that was it! The mines! 
Vodium, an ultrahard isotope of 
tungsten, had been discovered on 
Rigel VI several years before. But 
until machinery - - robot-operated 
tools - - could be brought in, it 
couldn't be mined; vodium was 
too radioactive for it to be possible 
for any human to work in the 
mines, even with a radiation suit. 
So Zamenkov was forcing the natives to do the work - - and reaping 
the profit for himself. 

No wonder he was afraid of the 
Interstellar Colonial Commission, 
Mike thought. Slavery was a capital offense under the Interstellar 
Agreement! 

"May I turn around?" Mike 
asked. 

"Yes. You may turn, Skyman." 

He turned slowly and saw, not 
one, but five of the Rigellians. The 
others had remained silent. They 
stood half a head . taller than Mike, 
who was an inch over six feet. Their 



blue skins were dark in the faint 
moonlight, but their luminous redorange eyes glowed like live coals. 

"Come," said the Rigellian, pointing through the swamps. "We will 
go to our Wise Old One. We will 
see whether you are he whom you 
claim to be." 

THE WISE OLD ONE of the 
village was more wrinkled than 
the younger men, and his skin had 
faded slightly from the normal 
royal blue which blended so well 
with the Rigellian vegetation, but 
he was still strong, and held himself erect as a leader should. 

"The Skyman Who Hunts All 
Animals, eh?" He stood there, the 
firelight from the community firepit flickering over his wrinkled face. 
"If that is so, where is your lady?" 

"At my camp to the west, Wise 
One. As you know, we Skymen cannot eat your food; it makes us ill 
and does not nourish us. I went 
to the City of the Skymen to get 
more food and equipment, but I 
left her behind." He went on to 
explain what had Sappened in 
Rigel City. 

"Ah," said the old man, "then 
this new leader is a criminal! We 
are glad to hear that. We have respected your people for many 
years, and it pained us to see that 
you had betrayed us." 

"We hadn't. Zamenkov has all 
the guns. My people fear him too." 



HUNGRY WORLD 



107 



The Wise One nodded. "We will 
check on your story," he said. 

All that night, the drums of the 
Rigellian swamp people throbbed 
in the damp air, beating out a 
message that travelled westward, 
from village to village, over the 
hundreds of miles that separated 
Mike from his wife. Not until late 
the next morning was the answer 
received. And by then, Mike himself was getting hungry. 

The Wise One came to the hut 
where Mike had been guarded 
through the night and said, "We 
have received word from our 
brothers that your story is true. 
Forgive us for doubting." 

Mike grinned. "Forget it. It 
was only natural." Then he frowned 
uneasily. He could still hear the 
throbbing of the drums. "What's 
going on?" 

The Wise One drew himself up 
proudly. "Skyman Who Hunts All, 
for a long time you have befriended 
our people. You have showed us 
how to make better traps and how 
to make better points jpr our 
spears. You have been good to our 
sick and our injured. You have 
helped us when we were in need. 
Your fame has spread all over the 
world. 

"And now it is you who need 
help. You and your lady need 
food - - the food of Skymen. We 
will help you get it." 

Mike's frown grew deeper. "Help 



me? How?" 

The old Rigellian gestured toward the throbbing drum. 

"We have decided. We will attack 
the city and get food for you. And 
at the same time we will avenge 
ourselves for our brothers who 
have been enslaved." 

Mike shot to his feet. "No! you 
wouldn't stand a chance! Zamenkov's heat beams would cut you 
down by the hundreds -- by the 
thousands! Many of your people 
would die, and many of the innocent Skymen would die. No, that 
isn't the way, Wise One." 

"Have you a better plan?" 

Mike rubbed his jaw. "I think so. 
Listen - -" 

RIGEL CITY, like the ancient 
cities of medieval Earth, was 
walled. The walls had originally 
been built to keep out wild ibeasts 
and the jungle. The site of the city 
had been marshland, originally, 
but the colonists had used pumps 
and Jenkins inversion driers to 
take the water out of the mud and 
convert what was left to solid 
ground, doing on a small scale what 
the Netherlands had been doing for 
a thousand years. But now the 
walls served another purpose. They 
were manned by Zamenkov's men, 
armed/to repel any native uprising. 

The spaceport was several miles 
from the city itself; accidents can 
happen when a ship lands or takes 



io8 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



off, and spaceports aren't good 
places to construct cities around. 

With a group of tough, junglebred natives, Mike Rath headed for 
the spaceport as soon as the fuzzy 
red globe of Rigel had set beneath 
the horizon. 

The spaceport, too, was walled, 
but it wasn't guarded. Why guard 
a square mile of flat, hard cementalloy? No Rigellian plant could 
grow there, no animal could find 
anything to kill, and no native 
would bother to take revenge on 
an empty plain. 

Of course, it wasn't completely 
empty; Mike knew that. There 
was always a man on duty in the 
blockhouse. In the unlikely event 
that a spaceship should land, there 
had to be someone on duty to turn 
on the landing beams and the lights 
to illuminate the field at night. 

Quietly, Mike and the ten 
Rigellians boosted each other over 
the wall. Mike hauled the last man 
up with a grass rope. 

In absolute silence, they walked 
to the blockhouse, a great, thick 
walled structure designed to protect its occupants against accidental 
mishaps such as out-of-control 
spaceships. 

Keeping well in the shadows, 
the Rigellians surrounded the structure. Then Mike Rath walked 
boldly up to the heavy, transparent 
plexisteel door. His clothing was 
muddy and he looked as though he'd 



been going through hell -- which 
he had. He actually was almost as 
tired and hungry as he looked. 

He slammed his hand against 
the door. The man inside looked up, 
startled. He peered into the darkness and then turned on the intercom that allowed him to speak 
through the door. 

"What do you want?" 

"I got locked, out of the city 
gates," Mike said, hoping his voice 
sounded desperate enough. "Let 
me in." 

The guard was unsuspicious. The 
only thing he had to fear was the 
natives, and it would never occur to 
him that any Earthman would be 
in league with the blue-skinned 
Rigellians. He opened the door. 

And the room was suddenly 
filled with natives. 

Taking care of the guard was 
the work of a moment. Mike exchanged clothes with him and said, 
"All right. Now we'll take the tunnel to the city." 

npHE LONG UNDERGROUND 
tunnel that led* to the city 
from the spaceport was wide and 
well-lighted. As they reached the 
ramp that led up to the terminal at 
Rigel City, Mike signalled the 
Rigellians to be silent. Then he 
strode up the ramp. 

The guard at the top of the ramp 
was half-dozing as Mike stepped 
into view. He blinked sleepily and 



HUNGRY WORLD 



109 



said: "What's the matter, Ed? 
You ain't -- hey!" 

He had seen, suddenly, that it 
wasn't his friend, but by then it was 
much too late; Mike had slugged 
him with a rabbit punch to the 
neck. 

He gestured to the Rigellians. 
"Okay. You know what to do." 
They nodded and left the terminal 
building, disappearing into the 
darkness while Mike, alone, headed 
for the Government Building. 

He walked straight up to one of 
the gates in the high fence that 
surrounded the building. The man 
on duty paid absolutely no attention - - and an accurately-thrown 
rock made sure he wouldn't pay 
attention for a long time. 

Mike took the man's gun, trussed 
him with his own belt, and dumped 
him in the shadows behind the 
guard shack. 

Then he waited. 

It was nearly five minutes later 
that a siren wailed over the city. 
The phone in the guard shack rang. 

Mike picked it up. "Yeah"? 

"Something's happened," said a 
voice from the other end. "The 
natives have opened the main gate 
to the city! Keep your eyes open!" 
There was a click as the- circuit 
was broken. 

This was it! With the soldiers 
distracted by the uprising at the 
gate, no one would notice that 



there was an extra man moving 
around. Within a few seconds, 
there were uniformed men running 
all around the building. Mike 
found it ridiculously easy to trot 
over to the main entrance, take 
an elevator up to Zamenkov's 
suite, and step in. 

Zamenkov was alone. He was 
barking orders into a visophone, 
and he snapped it off and looked up 
af Mike in irritation. "What are 
you - -" 

Then his eyes widened as he saw 
the gun levelled at him and recognized the face. 

Neither man said a word as 
Mike walked over to the screen 
and changed the code signals. He 
was going to put a call through on 
the interstellar radio to the ICC. 

He took his eyes off Zamenkov 
for just a fraction of a second to 
check the frequency indicator - and that was just a fraction of a 
second too long. Zamenkov's hamlike hand picked up a heavy paperweight and threw it with the accuracy of a baseball pitcher, 
knocking the gun from Mike's 
hand. 

Then he charged. 

Zamenkov was big and slow on 
his feet, but quick with his fists. His 
first punch knocked Mike back 
against the wall, but Mike dodged 
agiley around and clubbed down 
on the back of Zamenkov's head. 



no 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



The big man whirled heavily, only 
to meet a desperate assault. Mike's 
fists tattoed his chest and stomach, 
then smashed upward at his face. 
Zamenkov sagged backward, out 
cold. 

Mike reached for the Visophone 



again. "Give me ICC," he said 
crisply. While he waited, he 
glanced longingly at the huge refrigerator that the fat man had 
installed in his office. He hoped it 
had plenty in it - - he was starving.

"fc .Automation, & J^rt 



IT appears as if things have quieted down a bit since the last scientists warned of the horrors of 
automation! The best now believe 
that, instead of tremendous numbers of unemployed people, displaced from their jobs by machines, 
(the first writers were actually 
afraid of this) a new leisure will be 
given us — not to mention abundance. 

Automation is as inevitable as 
taxes, and a sensible resignation or 
appreciation of this fact is going 
around the world. Science has given 
the machine a brain, minute perhaps, but never-the-less so useful 



orrord.** 



that it is able to replace humans in 
many unpleasant repetitive tasks. 
Furthermore it is tireless. 

This miracle developed under a 
moral capitalistic system will so 
benefit everybody that there is no 
longer any question of its dangers. 
We control the automatic machines 
— not they us! 

When you pass through Detroit 
next time, visit a motor block plant 
and observe the way the bulk of the 
world's work will be done a few decades hence. Is it good? — of course 
it is — just look at our standard of 
living!

The Man Who Hated Noise 

. S, f ffl\. ^Jennesliaw 

Mr. Pimms was irritated with the world 
about him. Nothing hut talk of war and blaring 
TV commercials. But his machine would stop it! 



iiT? XTREE -' Ex-tree f 

f' j "Soviet refuses U. S. 
terms! International tension builds! Reedallabout it!" 

Mr. Pimms snarled bitterly at 
the echoing shout of the newsboy 
on the sidewalk fourteen floors 
below. Angrily, he walked over 
and slammed down the window. 
The noise made him wince. 

Even with the window closed, 
the raucous blare of horns and the 
throaty rumble of trucks from the 
distant streets below pounded 
against Mr. Pimms' ears.. 

Noise! People were always 
making noise! It almost seemed a 
deliberate campaign to torture him. 

Well, just wait. Mr. Pimms 
would show them. He'd give to 
the world the device, it had so 
long needed. 

He smiled contemplatively at 
the array of wires and tubes on 
his desk. There was just a little 



more work to do, and then the 
Pimms Silencer would — at longlast — be a reality. 

He sat down and went to work 
with a soldering iron and pliers, 
attaching the components according to the complex wiring diagram he had drawn up. 

As he completed some elaborate 
joinings of micro-transistors, Mrs. 
Barnaby, in the next apartment, 
turned on her TV set. 

"What gets all the kiddies' 
votes? 

A great big bowl of WH EETIE-OATS!" 

The strident singing commercial 
was repeated two or three more 
times. Mr. Pimms cursed under 
his breath and tried to concentrate 
on what he was doing. 

"And now, Fenton Quimby, with 
the news," said the TV. 

Mr. Pimms sighed, got up, and 
walked over to a wall cabinet. He 



112 



took out a pair of earmuffs. 

"In case of any danger, ev-eryone is requested to keep cool 
and go to the H-Bomb-proof shelters. You will be given plenty of 
warning," said Fenton Quimby 
importantly. 

Mr. Pimms put on the earmuffs, 
reducing the droning voice of the 
news analyst to a mere mumble. 
Then he went back to his work. 

He was almost through when a 
song came blaring through the 
wall. 

"/ love you, but I'm apprehensive; 

Keeping you is too expensive; 
You've got me on the defensive, 

Still, I love you baby!" 
Mr. Pimms snorted angrily and 



got up. He walked to his door, 
opened it, went down the hall and 
knocked on Mrs. Barnaby's door. 

WHEN she opened it, he said: 
"Mrs. Barnaby, would you 
please turn down your TV set? I 
can hardly hear myself think." 

The woman's face wrinkled. 
"Mr. Pimms, you never do anything but complain. I keep that 
set turned down so low that I can 
hardly hear it myself, and you 
know that." 

"You don't need to shout!" 
"I am not shouting, Mr. 
Pimms!" she bellowed. "I am using a normal tone of voice instead 
of that anemic whisper that you 
seem to think is a full speaking 
voice." She slammed the door in 



"3 



ii4 



IMAGINATIVE TALES 



his face, and the explosion of sound 
shook him clear down to his toes. 
He glared at the bare door for a 
moment, almost convulsed with 
anger. 

Then he stalked back into his 
room. The song was still going. 

"/ sure take an awful beating; 

I know, dear, that you've been 
cheating; 

Still, it's humble pie I'm eating, 
'Cause I love you, baby." 

Mr. Pimms got out some cotton, 
vaselined it heavily, and stuffed 
it under the ear-muffs into his ears. 
The noise became a little more 
bearable. He went back to work 
on the Pimms Silencer. 

It was nearly an hour before 
he finished. By that time Mrs. 
Barnaby had shut off the television set, so he could check his circuits in comparative ease. 

When everything was finished, 
he put it on his night table, stared 
expectantly at it for a moment, 
and plugged it into the socket. 

The wailing sound of a child's 
crying came through the wall. Mr. 
Pimms grinned savagely and jabbed the button on the Pimms Silencer. 

The wail stopped. So did the 
noise from the street. Mr. Pimms 
gingerly removed the muffs and 
earplugs. Still no noise. He filled 
his lungs with air and shouted. 

Or, at least, he tried to shout. 



He didn't hear a thing. He was 
surrounded by a complete wall of 
silence. Feeling a pulsing beat of 
triumph, he walked over and opened the window. Silence. Perfect, 
absolute silence. 

According to his calculations, 
the Silencer had an effective radius of thirty-five to forty feet. No 
noise could penetrate the" invisible 
barrier. For the first time in his 
life, Mr. Pimms had the silence 
his soul so desperately craved. 

He went back to his bookshelf, 
selected a book, and settled himself in his easy chair. From now 
on, he was going to enjoy life. 

-KJO NOISE disturbed Mr. 

^ Pimms that afternoon. He 
did not hear the wailing bleat of 
the big siren atop City Hall. He 
didn't hear the bellowing voice 
from the Public Address truck that 
moved through the streets. 

"ATTENTION! ATTENTION! 
INTO THE BOMBPROOF 
SHELTERS, EVERYONE! 
THERE IS NO NEED "TO PANIC, BUT YOU MUST BE IN 
THE SHELTERS WITHIN THE 
NEXT TEN MINUTES. HURRY, BUT DON'T PANIC. 
THERE IS NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. REPEAT: NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT. 
JUST WALK BRISKLY TO THE 
NEAREST SHELTER." 



THE MAN WH« 

Mr. Pimms did not hear the 
scramble of feet, the honking of 
automobiles, the excited voices. 

He did not hear the voice on 
Mrs. Barnaby's TV set, either. 

"Ladies and gentlemen, your 
attention, please! Enemy bombers 
have been sighted coming in from 
the north. The Air Force is doing 
its best to intercept them, and there 
is reason to believe that • they 
will be brought down before they 
do any damage I" 

Mr. Pimms read quietly while 
anti-aircraft guns hammered at the 
sky, and the screaming roar of 



HATED NOISE n 5 

fighter-interceptors echoed. 

Mr. Pimms finished the book 
and, still smiling happily, walked 
over to the window. 

He was in time to see something 
bright falling toward the ground. 

Then, suddenly, the sky was 
filled with an all-consuming brilliance. The terrible glare of a 
thermonuclear bomb, brighter 
than the sun itself, blossomed out 
over the city. For just a fraction 
of a moment, Mr. Pimms saw the 
awful light and felt the searing 
heat. 

Of course, he didn't hear a thing. 




HAVE YOU EVER met a 
morphosis? That's a pretty 
bad pun. I'm just holding my 
breath that it doesn't turn into an 
equally bad picture. The producer 
of The Mole People and The Black 
Lagoon tells me he plans to film 
Franz Kafka's literary phenomenon, 
"The Metamorphosis". Considering 
that Universal is Abbott & Costello's home lot, I shudder to think 
how the story may be metamorphosed by the time it is transferred 
to the screen. I can see its transfiguration right now: "The Studio 
that gave you Tarantula, The WolfMan and Abbott & Costello Meet 
Frankenstein, now Proudly Presents Franz Kafka's great horror 
classic . . . THE COCKROACH 
THAT CONQUERED THE 
WORLD!" I will happily be proven 
a pessimist. Hollywood did do a 
creditable job, for instance, with 



Maurice Sandoz' "The Maze", one 
of the last of the 3-D films, released under the same name as the 
Dali-illustrated book and, being 
about a Brobdingnagian batrachian 
human being something like 300 
years old, praiseworthily resisting 
the attempt to exploit the subject 
matter with a catchy title like THE 
FROG THAT CONQUERED THE 
WORLD or WHEN THE FROGMAN CROAKED. 

Did you know Dr. Jekyll & Mr. 
Hyde had a daughter? I doubt Bob 
("call me R. L.") Stevenson did, and 
since, according to the variety of 
movie versions from Barrymore 
thru Fredric March to Spencer 
Tracy, he died before he got married - - naughty! naughty! Anyway, 
somewhere, perhaps among the 
Dead Sea Scrolls, Hollywood has 
dug up the information that the 
good doctor (and his bad side) 



116 



had a baby girl, and she's grown 
up now and soon to make her debut. 

At the Roach Studios (they 
should be filming "The Metamorphosis"!) they're hatching a kraken 
for a picture that was originally 
to be called just that, The Kraken. 
Maybe they heard about John 
Wyndham's "The Kraken Wakes". 
Anyway, they've changed the shooting title to The Jagged Edge. What 
this Scandinavian sea monster - all 400' of it - - could be doing in 
the Salton Sea beats me, but I 
guess that's why they make such 
pictures: to educate the ignorant. 
I'll go and see. 

Speaking of higher » education, 
Universal Studios wishes, thru this 
column, to alert my many millions 
of readers to the fact that their 
forthcoming Land Unknown is not 
to be viewed as a sci-fi film but 
rather a science-F.ACZ' picture. So 
when you go and see a dozen different dinosauria disporting themselves at the South Pole, just bear 
in mind that you read it in this 
column first that you are seeing 
pure extrapolation - - "estimation of 
a quantity which depends on one 
or more variables by extending the 
variables beyond their established 
ranges." Reportedly one of the highlights of the 1947 Antarctic expedition of Adm. Byrd was the discovery of a mysterious thermal 
area, devoid of ice and snow, where 
theoretically subtropical flora and 
fauna could exist. It is possible life 
in this region that The Land Unknown will picture. 

Brynie Foy, who dates back to. 
The Return of Dr. X, will next essay production of The Mysterious 



Island, Jules Verne's sequel to the 
highly successful filmization 20,000 
Leagues Under the Sea. Foy had 
planned to film "A Journey to the 
Center of the Earth" as well, but 
has bowed out in deference to the 
amount of work RKO has already 
put into preparation of the picture. 
Instead, he is negotiating with the 
estate of the late HGWells for 
movie rights to the master's "The 
Star", one of his famous short . 
stories about a planet from outer 
space that enters our solar system, " 
collides with Neptune, and the 
fused bodies menace all mankind as 
they approach Earth, causing natural upheavals and catastrophes. 
Handled right, this could be what 
When Worlds Collide should have 
been. Hope Ned Mann, of 80 Days, 
Deluge, Things to Come, etc., is 
engaged to create the spectacular 
special effects. 

There's -no such thing as a Necronomicon, Vicarion, Quadriopticon 
or Panchronicon, but an Electronicam has been invented by the Allen

saves time.

in HGWells' "Food of the Gods" 
. . . Roger Corman has announced 
his future schedule will include 
"The Man Who Sold the Earth" 
and "Revolt in 2900", which sound 
suspiciously like takeoffs on the 
Heinlein titles "The Man Who Sold 
the Moon" and "Revolt in 2100" 
. . . Then there's a "Boy Who 
Saved the Earth" (Thad Swift 
original) and Homer Eon Flint's 
"The Nth Man", which, as it is 
about a man who saved the world, 
has been retitled "The Man Who 
Destroyed the Earth"! That figures; you see, it was Austin Hall 
who wrote "The Man Who Saved 
the Earth" (which up in Canada 
they called "The Man Who Saved 
the World"). Now aren't you glad 
you aren't competing for the |64,000 sci-fi question? Because as 
practically no one remembers, a 
story called "The Man Who Sold 
the Earth" was once published; it 
was authored by Thornton Ayre, 
who, as virtually no one remembers nowdays, was John Russell 
Fearn, an English author (tho the 
story was published in America). 
Now: Who's on third? 

"Vanishing Island", a stage play 
product of the Moral Re-Armament 
group, a world-wide movement with 
members in over 29 nations, will 
be turned into an epic motion picture for 1957 release. It's an anticommie musical of the near future. 

Jacques Sernas of Helen of Troy 
is slated to star in a telepic called 
The Man from 1997, a segment of 
the Conflict series. It is to be produced by Roy Huggins, who is 
credited with authorship of at least 
one fantasyarn.

"The Jet-Propelled Couch" by 
the late Dr. Robert Lindner has 
heen purchased by screen writer 
Stanley Roberts for independent 
production. Could be great if not 
goofed a la Philip Wy lie's "Gladiator", which was massacred as a 
farcical comedy starring Joe. E. 
Brpwn as the superman. 

Republic will produce SOS, Flying/ Saucer Attack, an original (?) 
script by Martin Van Laas. Pardon 
me if I sound cynical this season, 
it must have been something I saw. 

Promised (but not especially anticipated) from Allied Artists: 
Attack of the Crab Monsters. Ditto 
Columbia: Mark of the Claw. Associated Producers will offer a snow 
job called Man Beast, about the 
Abominable Mi-Go men of the icy 
Himalayas. Edward Calm, who directed The She-Creature, will next 
lens Zombies of Moro-Tau. Boris 
Karloff returns to the screen in 
Voodoo Island, while Maria English 
has been signed to star in Alex 
Gordon's production of Voodoo 
Woman. The title of The Petrified 
Man has been changed to The Man 
Who Turned to Stone. 

United Artists is releasing Pharaoh's Curse, which has a reincarnation theme. Bel^Air will produce 
Return of the Cat Goddess. The 
Mesa of Lost Women is 70 minutes 
of mad scientist, savage beauties 
and giant tarantulas. The Deadly 
Mantis, with its tremendous wingspan, will soon be menacing Manhattan. RKO is double-billing X 
the Unknown, starring Dean Jagger, and James Craig as The Cyclops. Actress Marie Windsor has

TOP STP FILM? . . . 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

I have been reading some of your 
recent issues of IMAGINATIVE 
TALES and find them very interesting
I like science fiction movies, and 
therefore enjoy SCIENTIFILM 
MARQUEE very much. It is a 
feature I never find in other stf 
magazines. 

My favorite science fiction movie 
is CREATURE FROM THE 
BLACK LAGOON. I would appreciate your telling me where I might 
send to obtain still photos about 
the "Creature". 

Miss Maria Terese Hrnek 
403 Indiana Ave. 
Chester, West Va. 
Can't say we agree with your choice 
of stf films as a "favorite" but 
we do agree it was entertaining. 
We're still rather partial to THE 
DAY THE EARTH STOOD STILL 
and we'll also include FORBIDDEN 
PLANET as a top-notcher. For 
photos we suggest ypu write to the 



editor of our SCIENTIFILM MARQUEE column, Forrest J. Ackerman, Addresss 915 S. Sherbourne

NOT ENOUGH HAMILTON! 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

THE COSMIC KINGS was the 
best piece of work Alexander Blade 
has ever done for TALES— the 
November issue. All in all now, I 
think you have fine illustrations. 
Yours would even be my favorite 
magazine except for the fact you 
don't get enough stories by Edmond Hamilton. THUNDER 
WORLD in the July '56 issue was 
a masterpiece! 

James W. Ayers 
609 First St. 
Attalla, Ala. 
Where, pray tell, do you find more 
Edmond Hamilton than in MADGE 
and TALES? Ed's one of our regulars, and we promise you'll be seeing many fine novels from his 
talented pen in the near future. 
Glad you liked Alex Blade's novel.

LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



That boy's really on the ball, and 
he's got some terrific material 
coming up soon too wlh 

COOL ENOUGH MAN! 

Dear Bill: 

I just finished the November issue 
of TALES and thought I'd drop 
you a line. I'm only fourteen but 
I've been reading both IMAGINATION and IMAGINATIVE TALES 
for four years. (When most people 
I know hear of a teenager reading 
stf they get the impression of somebody about five feet tall and a big 
thick head — not to mention hornrimmed glasses. To show you this 
is not the case, I'm six feet tall and 
play more than my share of baseball, basketball, and football. Like 
girls too!) 

But to get back to TALES, the 
November issue was cool enough, 
man, and Alex Blade, as usual, 
turned out another great novel with 
his THE COSMIC KINGS. 

On the short side, MICROSCOPIC 
NIGHTMARE and NO TRAP FOR 
THE KETH were good, but the 
others were barely passable. I'm 
sure glad to hear the news about 
Dwight V. Swain returning soon. 
Make it quick! 

Mike Kington 
2141 Tulane 
Long Beach, Cal. 
Dwight V. Swain is featured in the 
forthcoming April issue of our 
companion science fiction magazine, IMAGINATION. Don't miss 
his great novel, BRING BACK MY 
BRAIN! And to make you even 
happier, he'll be featured in the 
May issue of TALES with THE 
HORDE FROM INFINITY. And 



that's just the beginning ! So haunt 
your neivsdealer for our forthcoming issues. Better yet, why don't 
you— and everyone else who hasn't 
• — turn to page 130 and send in your 
subscription. JVe don't have to 
point out you're getting a terrific 
bargain — with ■ the guarantee of 
many months of the best in science 
fiction reading! — Even if there is 
an occasional short you don't like. 
So who's perfect? . , wlh 

TOP CARTOONS 

Dear Editor: 

I like IMAGINATIVE TALES 
very much, but what induced me 
to write is your cartoons. I get 
quite a good laugh out of them 
each issue, and after finishing an 
issue I cut them out and send them 
to my son overseas. He and his 
buddies share in their .enjoying 
them too. 

I'd like to add here that I have 
learned quite a bit from your short 
fact articles -at the ends of stories. 
Unlike spme skeptics, I feel that 
space travel is as certain a reality 
in the near future as the telephone 
and electricity are today. 

So I'll be digging you in the next 
issue, and am sure it will be an 
exciting one! 

Mrs. Quizelle C. Allen 
783 Shawmut Ave. 
Boston 19, Mass. 
We think you've got a good idea 
in sending our stf cartoons overseas. But why clip them out of the 
magazines? Send the entire issue 
so the boys can enjoy the stories 
too! We agree with you that space 
travel is just around the corner. 
If the truth were really known it

might surprise everybody ! _ Science 
has been making rapid strides in 
that direction wlh 

BLADE NOT FROM HUNGER! 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

November's short stories were 
strictly from hunger, and the 
Thames and Chase efforts smelled 
mightily of adaptation from other's 
works. However, THE COSMIC 
KINGS by Alex Blade was a fastpaced, interesting space opera and 
I loved every minute of it. I'm a 
sucker for a good space opera. 
Congratulate Blade for me. 

Helen M. Urban 
6520 Satsuma Ave. 
North Hollywood, Cal. 
We enjoy good space operas too, 
but we prefer to call them actionadventure stories. That's really 
what they are! But call them what 
you will — they're pleasant reading, 
and that's what counts. ..... . wlh 

EVERY BIT AS GOOD 

Dear Bill: 

After reading the November issue 
of TALES I was convinced that the 
magazine was every bit as good as 
you said it was. 

The stories I enjoyed especially 
were THE COSMIC KINGS and 
NO TRAP FOR THE KETH. 

Oh, yes, the cover was good — but 
when are you going to run another 
interplanetary scene like the one 
for the June '56 IMAGINATION 
which was excellent. 

To show I'm convinced your maga^ 
zine is good, here's my subscription. 

Bruce Taylor 
168 Ailing St. 



Kensington, Conn. 

Can't think of a better way to shovj 
us, Bruce. As to the interplanetary 
covers, Malcolm Smith is our expert on these, and he'll have a new 
one for you soon. wlh 

TOP RATING 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 

I've never written to a magazine 
before so I guess it's about time 
I started!' 

I have bought every science fiction magazine on the stands, and 
since you get my first letter you'll 
see that yours rates at the top for 
me." I guess I can call myself a fan 
now too, since I've been reading 
science fiction for over a year now. 
Here's my sub, and keep sending 
us good stories ! 

Bonnie Coffelt

Compton, Cal. 
Welcome into the fold, Ronnie. And 
you can just bet we'll be sending 
you nothing but the best in science 
fiction. wlh 

PRETTY MEDIOCRE 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

For the most part, the November 
issue of TALES was pretty mediocre. Alexander Blade's THE 
COSMIC KINGS stunk! The aforementioned story was so lousy I 
found myself skipping whole parts 
of it. Tell me, how can you continue 
to publish such crud? 

MICROSCOPIC NIGHTMARE: 
This should have been titled 
SCIENCE FICTION NIGHTMARE instead. C. H. Thames is 



LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



■writing mostly crud these days. 
THE VALIANT DIE HARD : hack 
all the way through. And, pray 
tell, how does the title tie up with 
the story? THE LAST ENEMY: 
only decent yarn in the lot. However, as usual the two enemies, 
male and female, go off arm in arm. 
THE RUNAWAY: must have been 
printed to fill up space. Also, the 
lead character here acted as though 
he were an eight-year-old. He was 
supposed to be twelve, I believe. 
NO TRAP FOR THE KETH: I 
couldn't get past the third page. 

I want to ask you a question: 
what do you think a sense of won


127 

der is? Personally, the only magazine that really gives me a sense 
of wonder is Ray Palmer's OTHER 
WORLDS. And sometimes a piece 
in IF or GALAXY. 

To Roger Ebert: Know why "The 
Magazine of Fantasy & Science 
Fiction", is highbrow? I'll tell you 
— it's the "literary" magazine of 
science fiction. 

More covers in the current vein, 
please. Try to get Rognan to make 
his figures a bit more realistic, 
though. I also prefer girly, sexy 
type covers. They're the best, you 
know!

IMAGINATIVE TALES 



1090 Grand Concourse 
Bronx, N.Y. 
We think the stories we print in 
both MADGE and TALES contain 
a sense of wonder. So that answers 
your question. If you don't like 
them then your sense of wonder is 
different than ours. For an example 
of our point of view, any lead novel 
we print. You'll find plenty of interplanetary and inter-galactic adventure, and since we feel that stories 
of this type represent the destiny 
of mankind they impart more than 
a share of "wonder" to us. What 
could be more thrilling than visiting other planets in other solar 
systems light years distant? Our 
stories allow us to do that. As to 
the yarns you mentioned being 
"crud", you'll note other readeropinions differ . . wlh 

WRITING A BOOK ON STP . . . 

Dear Mr. Hamling: 

Although I am only 12 years of 
age I have been reading your magazine for some time, and I already 
am a confirmed science fiction fan. 
The same goes for my best girl 
friend, Carole Cushman. In fact, 
we're both so interested in science 
fiction we're writing a book! 

Please keep us happy with your 
great magazines. As to the type of 
stories we like best, we pick THE 
MAN WITHOUT A PLANET 
which you ran in the July '56 issue. 

Susan Powell 
33 Robin Ed. 
Rumson, N.J. 
Glad to hear from you, Susan, and 
tell Carole to drop us a line sometime soon, too We'd also like 



to comment here that we get many 
letters every month from young 
readers saying that they're so enthused over science fiction they're 
writing stories themselves. We think 
this is a healthy and wonderful 
thing for the field since the writers 
of tomorrow are those who are 
starting out now. Sure, they'll turn 
out pretty sad efforts in the beginning; but they'll learn. And if 
they have any talent they'll pass 
over that invisible line separating 
"rejects" from salable stories sometime in the future. More power to 
all you young people! And while 
we're on the subject, young people 
are the life blood of science fiction. 
We're very proud of the fact that 
IMAGINATION and IMAGINATIVE TALES include tens of thousands of young readers in their circulations. It's a healthy sign for 
the future too — since our world is 
rapidly embarking on an age of 
advanced technology. And what 
better field . than science fiction to 
lay the groundwork for our future 
scientists! Not to mention those 
wonderful adventurers who one day 
soon will challenge and conquer 
outer space! Who knows, YOU may 
be one of them wlh 

FLYING A TRUE COURSE 

Dear Bill Hamling: 

The November issue of IMAGINATIVE TALES was right on the! 
beam, flying a true course along 
the science fiction Milky Way 

The novel, THE COSMIC KINGS, 
was excellent. And the rest of the 
stories were swell, each in their 
own way. 



LETTERS FROM THE READERS 



129 



As usual, I enjoyed all the features, especially SCIENTIFILM 
MARQUEE. If a few of the suggested movies are produced I can 
look forward to some fine science 
fiction at my local theater! 

Alan Moore's letter suggesting 
that each reader introduce somebody new to science fiction is a 
good idea. I've been doing that very 
thing for years! — I have found, 
of course, that you don't interest 
everybody. In my case I've succeeded in one out of five on the 
average. 

W. C. Brandt 
Apt. N 
1725 Seminary Ave. 
Oakland 21, Cal. 
More power to you for introducing 
even one new reader to science fiction. It's interesting to think that 
if every reader was successful in 
getting just one new person into 
the field our ranks would he doubled 
overnight! That's something good 
to shoot at and we hope everyone 
will take part in the effort. . . wlh 

BRING ON THE ALIENS! 



Dear Bill: 

I wish you would have underscored your statement on page 129 
of the November TALES. To refresh your memory: "We feel Janice was referring to the type of yarn 
which makes you feel like the guy 
squatting in a box, arms folded, 
saying : 'People are no damned 
good!'" Now to the part for underscoring. "Science fiction is adventure into infinity — not onto a psychiatrist's couch!" 

I agree. And I,, for one proud individual, believe that I, as a member of the Human Race, have something unique in this universe. 

If there are other beings, I'll 
wager an Earthman, given the 
chance could equal and surpass any 
of them. I feel I could! Bragging? 
No7 Just a game Terrestrial! Bring 
on those aliens!
